6 EX-LEADERS UNDER ARREST IN E. GERMANY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Six former Politburo members were arrested Friday as East Germany's shattered 
Communist Party opened an emergency all-night Congress to determine its state 
after 40 years of iron-clad rule. 
</P>
<P>
The state prosecutor filed warrants charging corruption and misuse of office 
against former leader Erich Honecker, former Prime Minister Willi Stoph, former 
secret police chief Erich Mielke and three other members of the ousted 
Communist hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor's office said that their houses were searched and that four of 
the men were jailed and denied bond. The ailing Honecker, 77, remained under 
house arrest and another was reported to be in Moscow undergoing eye surgery. 
</P>
<P>
There was no mention of any court dates for the politicians. Besides Honecker, 
Stoph and Mielke, they were former deputy Prime Minister Guenther Kleiber, 
former Agriculture Minister Werner Rolikowski and Hermann Axen, the former 
minister in charge of international relations, the man reported to be in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hans Modrow opened the emergency congress in an East Berlin 
sports arena, telling about 3,000 cheering delegates that the party must 
overcome the corruption scandal and radically restructure itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us not shatter this party, not let it go under, but make it clean and make 
it strong," Modrow urged. 
</P>
<P>
Modrow declared that the question of reunification of the two Germanys "is not 
on the agenda." 
</P>
<P>
East Germany's sovereignty should not "be sacrificed on the altar of so-called 
reunification," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Modrow appeared to be choking back tears at the end of his speech as he spoke 
of the party's responsibility "to do justice to this land that we love." 
</P>
<P>
The delegates planned to debate until dawn over proposals to rename, 
restructure or completely dissolve the party. 
</P>
<P>
Restructuring the party could mean doing away with the traditional hierarchy, 
which included a general secretary, a Central Committee and a Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
The party newspaper Neues Deutschland called Friday for "a complete renewal" of 
the party "if it is to survive." 
</P>
<P>
"Quite a few comrades see the only possibility is in practically dissolving the 
party and founding a modern socialistic party movement," it said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the resignation Sunday of the entire Politburo and Central Committee, the 
party has been run by a 25-member working group named to investigate wrongdoing 
and chart a new course. 
</P>
<P>
Gregor Gysi, head of the working group's investigative branch, was proposed 
early today as the next Communist Party chief. He told the congress that 
initial findings "are horrifying." He said the corruption extended to family 
members of party officials, whose "children . . . and even grandchildren" 
enjoyed the ill-gotten gains. 
</P>
<P>
Gysi said the committee "is not a prosecuting body" and thus would not name 
names or cite specific incidents. 
</P>
<P>
However, he did say that some officials hoarded Western goods that are not even 
available in East Germany's hard currency shops. 
</P>
<P>
Gysi blamed a "complete absence of any control" in the system for letting the 
thievery reach "catastrophic proportions." 
</P>
<P>
Repeating an earlier consensus of the working group, Gysi said the state 
security apparatus -- the once-feared secret police -- must be dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
The secret police, whose very jobs hinge on unquestioning loyalty to the 
now-defunct party leadership, have shown signs of skittishness in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
Their chief, Lt. Gen. Wolfgang Schwanitz, claimed district headquarters in 
several cities were taken over by mobs of violent citizens who feared that 
incriminating documents might be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters who have visited some of the supposedly besieged offices found no 
signs of violence or vigilante justice. 
</P>
<P>
The first few hours of debate at the party congress focused mainly on whether 
to change the party's name. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm not alone when I say we should dissolve it altogether," declared 
one delegate, who was booed by the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the speakers called for modernization of the party and social 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The party platform, published Thursday, called for "a clean break with the 
Stalinist system and with the power monopoly and abuse of power generated by 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The party met with opposition groups for the first time Thursday, further 
signaling a willingness to work in a coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
But mass public protests and cries for democracy suggest that Communists would 
have no chance of holding onto a majority when free elections are held. 
</P>
<P>
Modrow himself has publicly admitted that the party would probably get a mere 
20% of the vote if ballots were cast now. More than 10% of the 2 million 
members have reportedly quit in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The round-table meeting between party and opposition representatives resulted 
in a call for elections on May 6 and the drafting of a new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
State television, which broadcast the party congress live, showed Honecker's 
recently ousted successor, Egon Krenz, sitting in a back row. 
</P>
<P>
Krenz, who opened the Berlin Wall during his six weeks in office, was forced to 
resign. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing.

AMERICAN BALD EAGLES MAKING DRAMATIC GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American bald eagle, whose population plummeted two decades ago, has made 
such a dramatic recovery that federal officials may soon declare it is no 
longer an endangered species in all or most of the United States, 
environmentalists and federal officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The downgrading in status from an "endangered" to a "threatened" species would 
mean that the nation's symbol is no longer in immediate danger of extinction, 
and that protective actions can be relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of dollars have been spent to save the eagle, but experts credit an 
estimated sixfold increase in the bird's population since the early 1960s 
primarily to the 1972 banning of DDT. The pesticide, which continues to be used 
outside the United States, causes birds to lay eggs whose shells are so thin 
that they break before hatching. 
</P>
<P>
The eagle's reclassification to "threatened," which must be reviewed in public 
hearings before a final decision is made, would represent a stunning victory in 
the costly and mostly losing battle waged by government and conservationists to 
save vanishing species. 
</P>
<P>
So far, fewer than 20 species have been reclassified as "threatened" from 
"endangered," and only a handful of the more than 500 imperiled species in the 
United States have been declared out of danger. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important lesson in this is that the road to extinction can be 
reversed," said Michael Bean, chairman of the wildlife program at the 
Environmental Defense Fund, a Washington-based environmental group. "The more 
sobering lesson is that while it is within our power to do for other species 
what we have done for the eagle, we simply lack the resources." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the eagle has commanded a large share of the country's financial 
commitment to saving dying species. There are no figures on how much various 
government agencies and private groups have spent, but one conservationist who 
specializes in eagles put the figure at "at least" $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
"There probably has been as much or more money spent on the bald eagle recovery 
than for any other single species," said Daniel James, endangered species 
biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "That's because it's the 
national symbol, a flagship species for the endangered species program, a 
large, impressive bird that commands a great deal of awe and respect and public 
attention and sympathy." 
</P>
<P>
The bald eagle was first listed as an endangered species in parts of the 
country in 1967. Hundreds of eagles were later hatched in captivity, young 
birds were transported to parts of the country where they had disappeared, and 
research was undertaken to determine more thoroughly the eagles' range, eating 
habits and other behavior. It was not until about 1977 that the bird's 
population began growing, the year in which eaglets hatched after the DDT ban. 
</P>
<P>
Although state and federal goals for recovering the species have been met in 
four of the nation's five regions, the eagle's population still remains a 
fraction of what it may once have been. Federal officials say that there are 
now 2,588 breeding pairs in the contiguous United States, compared to an 
estimated high of 50,000 when Europeans first settled this continent. 
</P>
<P>
James and other U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials said the agency will 
publish a "notice of intent" in January to review a reclassification. Public 
hearings would then be held, and a proposal would not be made until March. A 
final decision would be reached only after the 1990 eagle breeding season. 
</P>
<P>
The "popular option" at Fish and Wildlife is to downgrade the eagle's 
classification throughout the country, James said, and "it would be easy to 
conclude" that the bird's status will be changed to a lesser imperiled category 
in parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The bald eagle already is considered a "threatened" species in Washington, 
Oregon, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, and it never has been listed as 
endangered in Alaska, where there are 8,000 to 12,000 breeding pairs. In 
California, where the eagle is still endangered, there are 82 nesting pairs of 
the bird. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting a month ago, U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials briefed 
representatives of major environmental groups on an internal draft proposal to 
consider a downgrading of the eagle's classification. Participants said the 
government officials seemed to be "testing the waters" for their January 
announcement. Several environmental representatives posed questions, but no 
avid opposition was expressed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it (the change) is justified," said Bean of the Environmental Defense 
Fund. "If you have things on the list that don't really belong there, you call 
into question the legitimacy of other species that really do need to be on it. 
</P>
<P>
"Given that the eagle has made a dramatic recovery, taking this action will 
convey a success story that is important for the endangered species program." 
</P>
<P>
Maurice LeFranc, director of the Institute for Wildlife Research for the 
National Wildlife Federation, said another option mentioned at the meeting was 
removing the eagle from the list altogether, which he said would raise strong 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they will take the prudent course and down-list," he said. 
</P>
<P>
LeFranc said he would support reclassification for most of the eagle's range 
but probably would object to it in the Southeastern United States, where the 
eagle has not yet met recovery goals. 
</P>
<P>
The official timetable for eagle recovery requires that nine of 12 states in 
the Southeast achieve certain goals over a three-year average. So far, Florida, 
Louisiana and South Carolina have met or exceeded their targets, but six other 
states need improvement with some lacking only a handful of nesting pairs, said 
James of the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials have not yet determined the number of eagles lost in South 
Carolina when Hurricane Hugo hit. 
</P>
<P>
If the eagle's status is reclassified to "threatened," penalties for killing 
the bird would be reduced, and federal wildlife officials would have more 
flexibility in allowing federal development projects near eagle habitat. 
</P>
<P>
But conservationists say the eagle would still receive adequate protection as a 
"threatened" species under the endangered species law and additional 
safeguarding under the Eagle Protection Act of 1940 and the Migratory Bird 
Treaty Act of 1913. Asked whether federal funding for eagle protection would 
drop, James said: "Hopefully not." 
</P>
<P>
As of Dec. 6, there were 427 "endangered" and 135 "threatened" species in the 
United States, and another 3,000 awaiting listing. Species that have either 
been taken off the list or reclassified downward include the American 
alligator, the snail darter and, in parts of the country, the brown pelican. 
</P>
<P>
The Endangered Species Act prohibits federal agencies from jeopardizing the 
survivability of a listed species through such activities as dam construction, 
and prohibits the public from killing the species through hunting or indirectly 
by taking their habitat for such purposes as development. 
</P>
<P>
Many species on the endangered list continue to decline in number, and some 
have been taken off because they became extinct. 
</P>
<P>
"The eagle is a success story, and it's good to have a success story as far as 
endangered species go," LeFranc said.

KILROY IS THERE, AND STUDENTS HOPE HE'LL STAY 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's 2:30 in the afternoon, the dismissal bell has just rung, and the kids at 
Kosciuszko Elementary School explode out the front door in a burst of pent up 
energy and anxious delight. 
</P>
<P>
Kilroy is here. 
</P>
<P>
That's Officer Howard Kilroy, the big, smiling Chicago policeman who has 
planted himself reassuringly in the center of the schoolyard like a guardian 
angel. He's as much a fixture in the gang-plagued, drug-infested North Side 
Puerto Rican neighborhood as Kosciuszko's chipped and shopworn 
turn-of-the-century brown brick facade. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi amigo, hi amigo," the youngsters shout, mobbing the gray-haired man in 
blue, pulling on his pants legs, hugging him, kissing him, filling his arms 
with Christmas cards made by hand with construction paper, crayons and love. 
"Are you coming back?" 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not. For 17 years, the mild-mannered 58-year-old Kilroy has been the 
soul, the conscience of Kosciuszko, a throwback to a bygone era when cops 
walked beats, knew everybody by name and were seen by children as role models, 
not objects of hate or fear. 
</P>
<P>
Because of budget cuts and a hiring freeze, Kilroy has been reassigned 
indefinitely from his familiar foot patrol near the school to a squad car. As 
of next week, he will no longer be around each day to watch over the students 
at Kosciuszko as they head home through one of Chicago's rougher neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
However, the story doesn't stop there. In a city in which police brutality 
charges frequently make headlines and ethnic strife can be as regular and 
bitter as the winter winds, a bunch of Latino kids have started a major battle 
on behalf of a German-Irish cop who can't speak a word of Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want him to leave 'cause he's part of the cause," explained 
eighth-grader Waldy Gonzalez. "He's straight. He's a cool dude, bro." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a delegation of sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders lobbied Ronald 
Garcia, Kilroy's commander at the Shakespeare District precinct house, to plead 
for Kilroy's return. They've been promised meetings with Police Supt. Leroy 
Martin and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, and they have gathered "keep-Kilroy" 
petition signatures from all 1,104 Kosciuszko students as well as 900 of their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Walls in the school auditorium are plastered with hand-drawn posters of 
sad-faced youngsters crying, in both English and Spanish, "Where's Kilroy?" and 
"We want Kilroy." Dozens of youngsters have scrawled impassioned letters on his 
behalf, many illustrated with bright crayon pictures of happy stick-figure 
children holding hands with a smiling stick-figure policeman. 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Mr. Martin," Kateri Barreto wrote to the Chicago police superintendent. 
"I go to Kosciuszko school. We need Officer Kilroy to come back to our school. 
He keeps our school protected from gang members who come around and drug 
dealers. We miss him very much. Will you please bring him back to our school? 
The end." 
</P>
<P>
Technically, Kilroy, who has no children of his own, was only supposed to 
patrol nearby Pulaski Park, not the school, when he first began working the 
area back in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
But he figured that, as long as the school was so close, he might as well check 
in on the kids when they got out of class. One thing led to another, and pretty 
soon he started to get to know the youngsters, and they him. And, then he 
started telling them jokes, counseling them, helping them with their homework, 
pressing them to excel, breaking up fights and scaring away gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows him, it's unbelievable," said Jim Bailey, Kosciuszko's 
principal. "It's like something out of the past where the neighborhood 
policeman is a respected figure and not an object of scorn and derision." 
</P>
<P>
Kilroy, however, insists that he's done nothing out of the ordinary. "I'll walk 
the streets and these kids will say I'm their father, their grandfather, their 
godfather, even their mother," he said. "They're just starving for someone, 
anyone, to look up to . . . . I've always liked kids. I just think its our job 
to win friends. We have enough enemies already." 
</P>
<P>
Modest disclaimers aside, students, teachers and parents at Kosciuszko insist 
that Kilroy is something rare -- a genuinely nice, unpretentious guy who walks 
kids home from school, sponsors neighborhood ball teams with money from his own 
pocket and stands in for Santa Claus at the school Christmas pageant. 
</P>
<P>
Don Greczyk, the assistant principal at Kosciuszko, said that Kilroy is one of 
the few authority figures respected by local gangs and has broken up several 
gang fights by his mere presence. 
</P>
<P>
"People that don't even speak English know him well," said Emma Lozano, 
president of the community parent-teacher council at Kosciuszko. "They respect 
him and feel comfortable with him around their children. He's become sort of an 
institution around here." 
</P>
<P>
Kilroy's biggest fan in the neighborhood is probably Antoinette Lamorte, these 
days a 22-year-old junior college student but not too many years ago a 
frightened teen-ager from a troubled home. When she was 16, her mother died and 
her father started beating her. Lamorte decided to run away. She got as far as 
Pulaski Park, where she found the friendly policeman she had come to know from 
her days at Kosciuszko. 
</P>
<P>
He took the sobbing teen-ager down to the station house and stayed with her 
until juvenile officers found a relative she could stay with. Later, Kilroy and 
his wife, Mary, bought clothes for the girl. 
</P>
<P>
When Lamorte was flunking classes in high school, she would take her homework 
down to the park and Kilroy would read with her and help her study for tests. 
Several times, he talked her out of dropping out, and, after she had been 
graduated, he pushed her to continue her schooling. He even helped get her a 
part-time job as a police department crossing guard. 
</P>
<P>
"He's about like the perfect father," Lamorte explained. "I owe my life to him. 
After my mom died, I was just shattered. He gave me the courage to go on and 
stand on my own. These days he keeps on me. He doesn't push me. He shoves." 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, the police commander, said he regretted having to move Kilroy and never 
realized what an uproar it would cause. But, Garcia said, the district had 
become so short-staffed that he had been ordered by superiors to shift officers 
from foot patrol to squad cars, where they can more easily respond to emergency 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a double-edge sword," he said. ". . . It's heartwarming, if nothing else, 
to see the children looking up to the officers instead of down at them. The 
negative is that I am so busy trying to cover (the district). Am I the bad guy 
or what?" 
</P>
<P>
Kilroy, for one, doesn't think so. He said he sympathizes with Garcia's problem 
and understands the reason for the transfer. Still, Kilroy said, he can't wait 
to get back on the beat, especially after all the fuss everybody at Kosciuszko 
has made over him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm floored, it's like a dream," he beamed. "It makes my 33 years on the job 
just great. To think that somebody cares this much is unbelievable." 
</P>

COMMUNISTS TRY TO DEFEND TOP MOSCOW ROLE 
</P>

<P>
Its authority openly challenged and its policies increasingly questioned, the 
Communist Party sought Friday to defend its constitutionally guaranteed 
"leading role" in the Soviet Union by arguing that moves to reduce its power 
would slow the country's political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The party newspaper Pravda acknowledged in a somber and lengthy editorial over 
half of its front page that the party is now facing one of its most severe 
trials as it attempts to deal with the country's deepening economic crisis and 
to proceed with the reforms amid growing doubts about its ability to lead the 
nation and widespread uncertainty about its strategy for change. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pravda admitted the eventual possibility of a different role for the 
party in the future, the importance of the editorial was its effort to rally 
the party in advance of a crucial meeting today of its policy-making Central 
Committee and an equally patent attempt to calm the mounting fears here that 
the nation is blundering into a dead end. 
</P>
<P>
Many party members "have lost the will to fight in the face of the multitude of 
constantly arising problems," Pravda said. "A mood of insecurity and pessimism 
is now prevalent." 
</P>
<P>
The current political atmosphere is unusually contentious, adding to the 
atmosphere of crisis and further undermining public confidence. 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow party committee held a special meeting on Friday evening to urge the 
party's ruling Politburo to remain "resolute and firm" in its stand and not to 
take "hasty and insufficiently considered political decisions." Rumors had been 
spread, it said, with the intention of "splitting the party's Central 
Committee," but it gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
Two rallies, each organized by party officials, have been held in Leningrad 
recently to support the latest reforms. More than 40,000 gathered there this 
week to support President Mikhail S. Gorbachev against what they said was an 
attempt to oust him. At the earlier meeting, Gorbachev was denounced for 
carrying reforms too far. "We don't let you kill communism with perestroika," 
one banner warned Gorbachev, attacking his reform program. 
</P>
<P>
Open challenges are growing from nationalists in the Baltic republics of 
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, in the southern republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan 
and Georgia and, to a lesser extent, in Byelorussia, Moldavia and the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
The party and its top leadership are expected to come in for sharp criticism 
when the Congress of People's Deputies, the national assembly, meets here 
Tuesday for its semiannual session. 
</P>
<P>
Radicals, led by Andrei D. Sakharov, a Nobel Peace laureate, and four other 
Congress members meanwhile are attempting to organize a nationwide two-hour 
symbolic strike, modeled on one last month in Czechoslovakia, to demand 
revision of the constitution to end the party's preeminent role in political 
life here. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of a major political shake-up at the Central Committee meeting abound, 
having spread across the country more than a week ago -- but without any 
consensus on whether liberals or conservatives would win in the implied 
showdown today. 
</P>
<P>
The principal item on the Central Committee's agenda is the economy and the 
government's efforts to resolve the present problems in the next year or two, 
with more fundamental reforms to be phased in over five or six years. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov is scheduled to provide the 250 committee 
members with a preview of the five-year, step-by-step program of economic 
reform worked out by Leonid I. Abalkin, the vice prime minister in charge of 
economic policy, and to seek their approval for it. 
</P>
<P>
But the likely debate will be as much about where the country is headed as 
about how it will get there as the realization grows that 1990 will probably 
prove to be the decisive year for the success or failure of perestroika and 
thus a year that will shape the fate of the country for a long time to come. 
</P>
<P>
The role of the party is an essential element of that debate, and there is an 
unprecedented and growing challenge to Article 6 of the Soviet constitution 
proclaiming the Communist Party's leadership of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Similar provisions were recently stricken from the Czechoslovak, East German, 
Hungarian and Polish constitutions, and the Soviet party is clearly resolved to 
stay ahead, if it can, of the nation by demonstrating its leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The Parliament in the Soviet Baltic republic of Lithuania voted this week to 
remove this provision from its constitution and re-establish a multi-party 
political system there. Armenia, Estonia and Latvia are preparing to do the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
"The talk is about destroying this obsolete system, making the party a true 
political and ideological fighting force, acting within the limits of the 
constitution," Pravda said. "However, one cannot but notice the obvious: under 
the cover of 'ultra-radical' ideas, attempts are being made to diminish and, if 
possible, devalue the party's authority, to elbow it out of the political 
arena." 
</P>
<P>
Such radical moves are winning wide support, Pravda acknowledged, but in 
practice they would mean handing over power to the politically ambitious -- 
people without a clear program for solving the country's problems or even a 
commitment to socialism. 
</P>
<P>
The solution, Pravda argued, is not in stripping the party of its pre-eminent 
political role -- at least not now in the midst of transition -- by amending 
the constitution or shifting all power to elected bodies. 
</P>
<P>
The party would not, as the reforms progressed and its own character changed, 
retain forever this privileged position, Pravda said, and these constitutional 
provisions could be changed as the whole constitution is rewritten. 
</P>
<P>
"With full certainty, we must declare that we shall not cling to the letter of 
the concrete formula," Pravda said in its editorial. "Any constitutional 
formula or provision, including Article 6, can be revised and modernized, right 
down to its complete removal. This should be done within the framework of the 
fundamental and constructive revision of the entire text of the constitution, 
and such work has already started. 
</P>
<P>
"But in this connection a question arises: Will a revision of just one article 
be feasible? And on an urgent basis, too? We must sort out the issues without 
the artificially whipped emotions and irresponsible appeals. We must weigh 
whether all this pushing will benefit perestroika." 
</P>
<P>
The party's proper response is to reinvigorate itself, Pravda argued, and to 
demonstrate through correct policies its right to lead the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Perestroika needs the party, but a renewed, active and strong party," the 
paper said. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda, attempting to rally party members in advance of the elections that 
begin on Sunday in the country's 15 constituent republics, admitted that the 
party is facing a tough fight but warned against "defeatist attitudes."

<P>
At the beginning of this century, when the United States acquired the 
Philippines from Spain, humorist Finley Peter Dunne summed up the American 
attitude toward its first overseas territory. 
</P>
<P>
"We propose f'r to l'arn ye the uses of liberty," Dunne wrote, as the 
fictitious Mr. Dooley. "We can't give ye any votes . . . but we'll threat ye 
th' way a father shud threat his childern if we have to break ivry bone in y'er 
bodies." 
</P>
<P>
Now, after 90 years and numerous unheeded warnings, it's lesson time again for 
the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the latest attempted coup attempt against Philippine President 
Corazon Aquino, U.S. policy-makers, analysts and Congress members are saying 
that the United States should send an urgent message to Aquino to quickly 
reform her leadership style and her government. 
</P>
<P>
But what, exactly, does the United States want Aquino to do? 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to specifics, there is little agreement in Washington on what 
sort of changes the Bush Administration should seek in order to bolster the 
Aquino government and protect America's strategic interests in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Experts inside and outside the U.S. government disagree both on the root causes 
of the attempted coup and on the lessons to be learned from it. 
</P>
<P>
Some say the top priority is for Aquino to crack down on the military, to 
arrest, prosecute and imprison the officers who sought to seize power. 
</P>
<P>
"She's got to go after these guys, jail them for life, something for real," 
said a staff member of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia. "None of 
these 100-push-ups kinds of punishments." 
</P>
<P>
Others express sympathy with the coup leaders, arguing that their actions 
reflect deep-seated grievances in the Philippine armed forces that Aquino must 
try to answer. 
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. experts maintain that President Bush should goad Aquino to move 
faster on social reforms. Those most frequently mentioned are a drive against 
corruption and a serious program of land reform, one that would break up huge 
tracts like Aquino's family estate, Hacienda Luisita. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Richard Fisher, an Asia specialist at the Heritage 
Foundation, argues that one of the urgent messages the Bush Administration 
should give Aquino now is that her modest, limited program of land reform has 
already gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
"Land reform should be scaled way back," Fisher said. "It's shaping up to be a 
real boondoggle. It's clear to me that in some areas of the Philippines, like 
(the island of) Negros, land reform will chase away not only the hacienda 
owners but the rural middle class." 
</P>
<P>
The one thing the Washington experts seem to agree on is that the attempted 
coup and Aquino's panicky request for U.S. warplanes to defend her government 
were extremely damaging, both to Aquino's political future and to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. specialists are comparing the situation to the problem the Reagan 
Administration confronted with then-President Ferdinand E. Marcos five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 and 1985, the Reagan Administration concluded that Marcos was in deep 
trouble and that unless he made quick changes, a Communist insurgency might 
succeed. A parade of U.S. emissaries were sent in an unsuccessful effort to 
promote reform. 
</P>
<P>
After Marcos fled the country in 1986 and Aquino came to power, the Reagan 
Administration eventually found itself urging changes upon the new president. 
The U.S. warnings to Aquino became a crescendo after an unsuccessful coup 
attempt in August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 attempt touched off a debate within the U.S. government that continues 
today. Pentagon officials argued then that military rebels had legitimate 
grievances. 
</P>
<P>
"The abortive coup . . . highlighted a number of grievances that had been 
building in the Philippine armed forces since the February, 1986, revolution," 
Karl D. Jackson testified. Jackson, then a deputy assistant secretary of 
defense, is now Bush's top national security adviser for Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Among the grievances, he said, were "the expectation of many Philippine 
military personnel that the departure of Marcos would rapidly improve the 
condition of the armed forces, elevate its status in Philippine society, and, 
above all, concentrate government efforts on . . . the festering Communist 
insurgency." 
</P>
<P>
Now, many U.S. analysts are citing these same military grievances -- along with 
popular discontent over corruption and poor delivery of services by the Aquino 
government -- as the underlying cause of the latest coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
But Aquino's defenders insist that the military grievances are irrelevant and 
that the Philippine rebels deserve no sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a straight power struggle," said a staff member of the House 
subcommittee on Asia, whose chairman, Rep. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.), has been 
among Aquino's staunchest supporters in Washington. "The fact that (the rebels) 
launched a coup attempt does not mean Aquino is to blame. How does overthrowing 
a constitutional government help the Philippines' economic problems?" 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials and scholars say that however weakened Aquino's political 
position may be, the Bush Administration will continue to support her. 
</P>
<P>
"She's the only horse we've got -- worse for wear, but the only horse," the 
Heritage Foundation's Fisher said. "A military junta would soon deteriorate and 
open the path toward a coalition government with the Communists, which the 
Communists would soon consume."

SALVADOR JUDGE ORDERS AMERICAN CASOLO HELD PREPARATORY TO TRIAL

<P>
A Salvadoran judge on Friday ordered American church worker Jennifer Jean 
Casolo and six other people to remain in prison while a military court prepares 
to try them on terrorism charges. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Guillermo Romero Hernandez ruled that there is sufficient evidence to 
hold Casolo on charges stemming from a Nov. 25 raid on her house, where police 
say they found a cache of rebel weapons buried in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
The judge's ruling is not a decision to try Casolo. Romero has another 90 days 
to determine whether there is enough evidence for a trial. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo's attorney, Salvador Ibarra, said he will appeal the detention order. He 
said the judge has failed to show any proof that tied Casolo to the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo was arrested with two friends who were visiting her the night of the 
raid. Five other people named in the judge's order were arrested two days 
earlier, and one of them allegedly implicated Casolo. All are charged with acts 
of terrorism, possession of war weapons, illicit association and subversive 
association. 
</P>
<P>
According to police reports made available to The Times, the other five men and 
women are accused of belonging to the People's Revolutionary Army, one of five 
groups that make up the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which is 
fighting a guerrilla war to oust the U.S.-backed government. Their inclusion in 
the case appears to be an effort by authorities to strengthen and broaden the 
complaint against Casolo. 
</P>
<P>
The judge based his ruling on a three-page police report that describes the 
raid on Casolo's house. Police authorities say agents unearthed more than 
20,000 rounds of ammunition, grenades and explosives. 
</P>
<P>
Also vital to the government's case is a videotape that police made the night 
of the raid. It shows agents pulling sacks of bullets and explosives out of an 
underground tunnel in Casolo's garden. It also shows snapshots that police say 
were buried with the weapons and which allegedly depict Casolo and members of a 
U.S. congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo denies all of the accusations against her. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo's arrest came amid the largest guerrilla offensive in the 10-year war 
and a subsequent government crackdown on church groups, foreigners working for 
humanitarian agencies and Salvadoran dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Legislative Assembly voted to extend a nationwide state of 
emergency for another 30 days.

MONTREAL LOOKS WITHIN ITSELF IN WAKE OF MASS KILLING;

Female radio sports-show host Danielle Rainville says she has been plagued for 
years by men who contended that she had stolen a job that rightly belonged to a 
man. Sometimes the calls came as often as twice a week, she says, adding, "One 
of them said that he was going to break my neck." 
</P>
<P>
But Rainville says she ignored the male griping until Montreal's shocking mass 
murder this week, in which the unemployed killer deliberately sought out female 
victims because he thought feminists in general had ruined his life. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Rainville is so nervous she says that she can't eat or sleep at night, and 
is not sure she will ever be the same again on the air. She has become both a 
subject of and a participant in a debate here over what the slayings may reveal 
about Canadian society. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, 25-year-old Marc Lepine entered the Ecole Polytechnique of the 
University of Montreal and went on a shooting spree in which he hunted down 
women and left men alive. In one mechanical engineering classroom, he even 
asked the men to leave the room before lining up the female students and 
opening fire on them. He was reported to have accused the women of being 
"feminists" as he fired. Fourteen women died, and 13 other people were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Some Montrealers are saying now that the murders were the work of a 
one-of-a-kind madman, a lunatic whose actions say nothing about mainstream 
Canadian attitudes toward women. Indeed, the details emerging about the man 
make him appear uniquely disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
Other Montrealers, however, argue that the killer's actions are only the most 
extreme example of sexism and violence against women -- and resentment of 
successful female professionals. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a particularly gruesome expression of anti-feminist sentiment, but we 
get this kind of thing every day," says Alice de Wolff of the National Action 
Committee on the Status of Women. "Usually, people do a tirade: miserable 
feminists trying to ruin the world." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators handling Lepine's case have said that the gunman's Algerian 
father left home forever when the boy was only 7, and that as a young man, 
Lepine proved himself incapable of maintaining stable relationships with women. 
They said that when things did not go his way with women, he would cut off all 
conversation and retreat to his room. 
</P>
<P>
Although given the name Gamil Gharbi at birth, he changed to his mother's 
French name as a teen-ager. He constantly wore a baseball cap, as if to hide 
his curly hair. 
</P>
<P>
Police have also learned that while Lepine aspired to study at the Ecole 
Polytechnique himself, he failed some of his preparatory classes and was never 
admitted to the elite engineering school. He was also turned down by the 
Canadian armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
He seemed to seek refuge from his personal troubles in war movies, which police 
said he watched as if "obsessed." He was known to frequent at least one 
Montreal gun shop. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors remember Lepine as a withdrawn and silent tenant. 
</P>
<P>
"I had nothing against him, but the way he was looking at everybody with big 
eyes!" said Gerard Claveau, Lepine's middle-aged next-door neighbor. "He was 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
On the evening of the mass murder, police arriving on the scene found a suicide 
note in Lepine's pocket, blaming his problems on feminists and containing an 
apparent hit list of prominent Canadian women. The next day, sports-show host 
Rainville found out that her name was on the list. (Police have been keeping 
the other names a secret, to protect the women.) 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I didn't know," Rainville says. "It makes me think that someday 
something like this will happen (to me). I haven't been able to eat since 
yesterday afternoon. I had nightmares last night." 
</P>
<P>
Rainville's fears echo what some other women here are thinking: That the killer 
might just have easily have chosen them, that his notoriety might inspire other 
men to kill again and that his hatred of women might represent something larger 
than a single diseased mind. 
</P>
<P>
"There's more than one Marc in the world," said the National Action Committee's 
De Wolff, whose office received a disturbing call Thursday from an unknown man 
who asked whether there were any men on the premises, then hung up when told 
there were not. The woman who took the call, frightened that the man was 
planning an attack, fled the office. 
</P>
<P>
After the mass killing, Montreal French-language newspaper writer Francine 
Pelletier said that she overheard male colleagues joking in the office that 
they sometimes felt like killing women themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Men have to find out what's wrong with themselves," she told a radio audience 
here. English-language newspaper columnist Albert Nerenberg aired a similar 
view in an article saying he felt "shame for my generation and shame for my 
cold-killing sex." 
</P>
<P>
"Marc Lepine took this society's battering, woman-hating secret and made it 
senseless, unthinkable mass murder," the column added. Nerenberg says he got a 
stream of angry phone calls the day the column was published, from men who felt 
he was vesting too much meaning in a single act of violence.

NEW U.S. ANDEAN DRUG POLICY FACES TEST; 
</P>
<P>
LATIN AMERICA: PERU AND BOLIVIA WANT MASSIVE ECONOMIC AID AT THE OUTSET. THIS 
THREATENS A U.S. TIMETABLE.

The Administration's new Andean strategy, which calls for giving more 
narcotics-fighting aid to Peru and Bolivia, could be slowed by demands of those 
nations that the program include an immediate increase in economic assistance, 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The demands conflict with an Administration timetable that would delay any new 
economic aid until at least 1992 and furnish that aid only if Bolivia and Peru 
make significant progress in the anti-drug effort. 
</P>
<P>
In discussions with the United States, the two cocaine-producing countries have 
demanded massive economic assistance at the outset of the proposed crackdown to 
cushion the blow to millions of campesinos dependent on the cocaine industry, 
the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Their statement provided the first specific indication that a major snag has 
developed as the Administration seeks to win approval from Peru, Bolivia and 
Colombia for its plan to take its war on drugs to those countries, which supply 
nearly all of the world's cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
A high-level U.S. delegation will travel to the Andean nations next week to 
outline the Administration plan in hopes of eliminating the potential impasse, 
which threatens to delay implementation of a planned $2.2-billion effort over 
the next five years, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our strategy recognizes the need for an economic component to the war on 
drugs," one official said. "But we don't believe there should be new aid until 
there is clear progress." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Congress gave the go-ahead to an Administration plan to spend $261 
million on anti-drug assistance to the three countries in the current fiscal 
year. Most of the money would go toward military efforts, with other funds 
allocated for law enforcement and intelligence. No money is earmarked for 
additional economic aid. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the positions taken so far by Peru and Bolivia indicate 
they might limit their participation in the anti-drug effort unless the 
economic assistance is forthcoming. The officials declined to disclose the sum 
of new assistance Peru and Bolivia are seeking for next year, but one source 
said it amounts to "hundreds of millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Colombia, whose economy is healthier than that of the other two and which has 
already demonstrated its willingness to undertake a major anti-drug effort, has 
not requested immediate economic assistance, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Other topics on the agenda of the traveling U.S. delegation, to be headed by 
Assistant Secretary of State Bernard W. Aronson, include still-secret proposals 
to bolster the American role in training South American troops for the 
anti-drug effort. Also to be discussed is a Pentagon plan, approved by the 
National Security Council, to station U.S. Navy ships off the northern coast of 
Colombia to help intercept ships and aircraft smuggling cocaine northward. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also work on plans for a summit meeting between President Bush 
and leaders of the Andean nations tentatively scheduled to be held at 
Cartagena, Colombia, next February. 
</P>
<P>
Bush told reporters in Denver on Friday that he hopes to go ahead with the 
meeting at Cartagena, despite renewed violence in that country blamed on 
Colombia's drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
Bush visited Denver and Houston to stump for Republicans and address anti-drug 
rallies. He commented after William J. Bennett, director of the 
Administration's office of national drug control policy, told reporters aboard 
Air Force One that the Administration is re-evaluating its plans because of the 
violence in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett said he had seen "no hesitation" on Bush's part. But he said the 
traveling U.S. delegation will try during its stopover in Colombia to determine 
if Cartagena is a safe place for the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"President Bush feels very strongly that President (Virgilio) Barco wants him 
to come, and he'd like to make every effort to come," Bennett said. But, he 
added, "the situation is so fluid now, we'll have to see as things develop." 
</P>
<P>
He described the security situation in Colombia as "very, very rough."

The United States confirmed that Iraq launched a rocket powerful enough to put 
a small payload into space, raising fears that the Arab nation has the missile 
capability to hit Israel or targets farther away. Officials had been skeptical 
that Iraq, which recently concluded an exhausting eight-year war with Iran, 
could achieve such a feat. Analysts said that scientists and engineers from 
Egypt and Argentina helped Iraq to develop the rocket.

The Communist Party at a hastily called meeting of the Central Committee 
expelled more of the old guard from its leadership Friday in the second purge 
of top party posts in four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Dropped were six hard-liners in the Politburo and 26 members of the 
policy-making Central Committee, including former leader Todor Zhivkov, who was 
ousted as party chief on Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
The committee's actions are seen as strengthening the hand of new Bulgarian 
leader Petar Mladenov in his push toward democratic reform. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's unannounced meeting also struck from the committee's record an 
expression of thanks made to Zhivkov for his leadership. Zhivkov ran Bulgaria 
in a rigid, Stalinist fashion for 35 years and is currently under investigation 
for corruption.

STOLEN KEYS OPEN THE LID ON PRAGUE PARTY SPLIT

With his broken wrist, rumpled suit and apologetic manner, Frantisek Valabek 
somehow personified the Communist Party for which he spoke. 
</P>
<P>
For Valabek, the problem was personal and immediate, but it spoke volumes about 
the state of affairs within the party. 
</P>
<P>
Standing awkwardly Friday in the press room of the party's Central Committee 
office, Valabek admitted his problem. A visit to the Tesla Hloubetin electric 
appliance factory in suburban Prague that he and a colleague had painstakingly 
arranged for two foreign reporters had just collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The trip had been set up so that the reporters could meet members of the 
People's Militia at the factory, a unit of the party's praetorian guard, which 
is being disarmed. The militiamen were eager to show off their new benign 
image. It fell to Valabek to inform the reporters that others were not so 
eager. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't get in," he said. After a long pause he added, "They've taken the 
keys." 
</P>
<P>
Valabek, his eyes on the floor, explained that when members of the party's 
local district committee learned of the visit, they went to the factory and 
stole the keys to the rooms that contained the militia weapons and other gear. 
Not even the once-powerful Central Committee office could pry them loose. 
</P>
<P>
"A visit today will be impossible, I'm afraid," Valabek said. "You need to come 
back next week, after the elections." 
</P>
<P>
Party elections are to take place over the weekend, to choose new committees in 
preparation for the emergency party congress scheduled for Dec. 20-21. The 
party leadership hopes the elections will end the reign of the hard-liners, 
exemplified by the men who took the militia keys. Reform-minded committees 
could be expected to send delegates who are receptive to overhauling the party 
for the democratic age ahead. But the message of Friday's incident at the 
appliance factory is that the road ahead will not be smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing complaints made two days earlier by Karel Urbanek, the party general 
secretary, Valabek said that many regional and district party committees refuse 
to understand that their power is no longer absolute. "It's like a drug," he 
said. "Once you have it, it's hard to give up." 
</P>
<P>
By mid-afternoon, the chief party spokesman, Jozef Hora, and a Politburo 
member, Vasil Mohorita, had become involved. But the keys were still not 
available. 
</P>
<P>
"Today is not possible," Hora said after discussing the situation with 
Mohorita. "Perhaps on Monday." 
</P>
<P>
Disarming the People's Militia, which has been one of the most visible symbols 
of party supremacy, has been a traumatic experience for the militiamen. Many 
felt slighted when Urbanek ordered them to turn their weapons in by last Sunday 
in order to reduce the risk of violence in the tense political atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"They felt they couldn't be trusted," Valabek said. "Their pride was damaged." 
</P>
<P>
According to Hora, the party spokesman, the People's Militia has 40,000 to 
50,000 members, all attached to factories and other institutions. The first 
units were formed in 1948, to defend such places against possible attack by 
counterrevolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
As communism itself has come into question, some militia units have voted to 
disband. Party secretary Urbanek announced that the militia will now be used to 
help in large-scale accidents or natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's that much to see anymore," Valabek told the reporters. 
"It's probably just a lot of empty shelves."

REFORMERS WANT MORE THAN RETRIBUTION, THEY WANT A PURGE; 
</P>
<P>
EAST BLOC: THERE IS A SENSE OF URGENCY BECAUSE THE ABUSE OF HISTORY HAS BEEN AS 
BAD AS THE ABUSE OF POWER.

<P>
Czechoslovaks demanding punishment for people who helped in the Soviet invasion 
of 1968, and East Germans besieging Communist Party offices to ensure that no 
evidence of corruption is destroyed, want more than just retribution. 
</P>
<P>
They are caught up, along with people in Hungary and Poland, in an effort to 
wipe away the moral wreckage of decades. 
</P>
<P>
It is as though the air had become so fouled with lies and deceit that the only 
way these people can see to go forward is by means of a thorough purge. 
</P>
<P>
All revolutionaries want to discredit the leaders they have thrown out, but 
there is an unusual sense of urgency about the process in East Europe, in part 
because the abuse of history in the region has been as bad as the abuse of 
power. 
</P>
<P>
When Czechoslovaks insist on correcting the record on 1968, the year of the 
so-called Prague Spring, and when Hungarians raise the same cry with regard to 
1956, the year their uprising was crushed, they do more than strip away the 
authorities' veneer of legitimacy; they buy a bit of insurance that the reforms 
of recent weeks will not be rolled back. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the desire to purge the people responsible for the past there is a 
sense of personal purge. The collapsing Communist systems were so riddled with 
corruption and failure that the vast majority of the people had to make 
compromises of their own. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ladislav Lis, an activist member of the Czechoslovak opposition 
group Civic Forum, the "normalization" imposed by the Soviet-backed leaders who 
took over after the repression in 1968 "caused the moral devastation of our 
society and national humiliation." 
</P>
<P>
A former Communist Party official who was expelled after 1968 put it this way: 
"There is hardly anybody in Czechoslovakia who hasn't, as we say, got some 
'butter on his head.' " All it takes is a little sunlight to expose it. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, according to Judith Pataki, an expert on Hungarian affairs with 
Radio Free Europe, the system devised in Hungary by former party chief Janos 
Kadar, who took over after the 1956 uprising, "was built so much on corruption 
that it drew into it almost everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Thus in moving to set the record straight, the people seem to be reaching back 
to a time when they felt better about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, the new freedom to express outrage helps to erase any guilt 
about any personal shortcuts that might have been taken, though this of course 
is not meant to understate the legitimate feelings of betrayal that pervade the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
In Czechoslovakia, half a million party members who supported the reforms of 
the Prague Spring were expelled as a result. Their attempt at building 
"socialism with a human face" was branded counterrevolutionary and 
Western-inspired. Their careers, and in many cases those of their children, 
were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps 100,000 Czechoslovaks were hounded out of the country and into exile, 
while their tormentors erased the reforms and settled into a comfortable life 
style secured by Soviet power. 
</P>
<P>
"You see these people living in villas, and you've lost 20 years of your life," 
a Western diplomat commented. "Psychologically you need some healing of your 
wounds. It's very difficult to resist this tendency." 
</P>
<P>
The diplomat was impressed earlier this week when a huge crowd of 
anti-government demonstrators, about 200,000 strong, took on an aggressive edge 
on the issue of 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"We await the day," Lis, the opposition leader, told the crowd, "when the names 
of those who inspired this shameful deal will finally be published. We have an 
inalienable right for their guilt to be investigated!" 
</P>
<P>
"Punish them!" the protesters shouted. "Punish them!" 
</P>
<P>
The Western diplomat said that "what I fear is that if this thing . . . gets 
down to these personal fights and revenge elements, then it loses its moral 
purity and everything is open." 
</P>
<P>
The level of outrage in East Germany over disclosures of high-level corruption 
has surprised Western experts almost as much as the East German leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Donovan, a Radio Free Europe analyst of East German affairs, said in an 
interview that one reason for this may be that the East Germans have always 
seen themselves as somehow "cleaner" than their neighbors in the region. It has 
been a central element in justifying the existence of an East German state next 
to capitalist West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In East Germany, she said, there has been little rush to the past -- to the 
ill-fated 1953 uprising in Berlin, or to the building of the Berlin Wall in 
1961. The corruption issue, she said, "has become the East German 1968 or 
(Hungarian) 1956 -- the first political issue that people can attach themselves 
to." 
</P>
<P>
Corruption was also a big issue in Poland, in 1980, after Solidarity, the 
independent trade union movement, got under way. But the outcry was never as 
loud and never reached as high into the leadership as that in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
When the Poles go after political skeletons in the closet, they look first for 
those with a Soviet label. Significantly, when Prime Minister Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki, a Solidarity man, made his first official trip to the Soviet Union 
recently, he visited Katyn -- the site of a World War II massacre of Polish 
army officers, long blamed by Moscow on Nazi Germany but widely believed to 
have been carried out by Soviet security services. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the Polish approach is much the same, however. By discrediting 
the Soviets, they discredit the system the Soviets imposed. The idea that a 
Pole could possibly be a part of that system is so repugnant that most Poles 
prefer to think of their Communist Party leaders as Soviet agents. Former 
Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger is not the only one who has referred to 
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Poland's president, as a "Russian general in a Polish 
uniform." 
</P>
<P>
The powerful drive to sort out the past extends to people who were not even 
around in 1956 or in 1968. Jiri Dienstbier Jr., 20, was prevented from entering 
a college preparatory study program for two years because of the dissident 
activities of his father, a former journalist who is now a spokesman for Civic 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
For young people, a Western diplomat in Prague pointed out, there is a question 
of identity. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to know what happened in the past for your own identity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There is a drawback to all this. Poles, Hungarians, Czechoslovaks and East 
Germans sometimes seem so preoccupied with the past that they lose sight of the 
need to build a future. 
</P>
<P>
A Hungarian journalist said she quit her job because she got fed up with 
co-workers arguing about who had done what after 1956. 
</P>
<P>
Jeno Kovacs, a member of the Hungarian Socialist Party Presidium, told an 
interviewer: "We've been dealing with the history of 40 years of unsettled 
political problems, which in a normal country would be low-key issues." 
</P>
<P>
What is needed, he said, is to get on with economic reform, but "as long as 
just history and politics are in the center of political and press attention, 
business is starving." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, because of so many years of lies and concealment "it was 
unavoidable and necessary to discuss these questions; it was a precondition for 
further steps." 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovaks and East Germans, now going down that same road, would no 
doubt agree.

A Dallas probate judge gave the Internal Revenue Service until Jan. 15 to prove 
its claim to proceeds from the sale of the gun Jack Ruby used to kill Lee 
Harvey Oswald after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Ruby's brother, 
Earl, has until Dec. 22 to prove his and other heirs' contention that they have 
a better claim to profits from the estate, the judge said. Jack Ruby owed the 
IRS $17,000 in taxes when he died in 1967, and the IRS says penalties and 
interest have pushed the amount to $86,010. Earl Ruby long has contested 
executor Jules Mayer's right to the gun, which Mayer says might bring $250,000.

EXXON SPILL KILLED AS MANY AS 270,000 BIRDS, REPORT SAYS

The Exxon Valdez oil spill killed between 90,000 and 270,000 sea birds, making 
it the deadliest such accident in history, and it will take up to 70 years for 
wildlife to recover, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The new mortality estimates are based on the number of carcasses recovered from 
Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska, as well as the known population of 
animals in the once-pristine region polluted by 11 million gallons of crude oil 
that spewed from the supertanker Exxon Valdez when it ran aground March 24. 
</P>
<P>
"On a global scale, the northern Gulf of Alaska harbors enormous populations of 
marine birds, and so the magnitude of losses from the Exxon Valdez spill was 
predictable and, not surprisingly, exceeds any other record of oil mortality we 
can find," said Fish and Wildlife Service biologists John Piatt and Calvin 
Lensink in their report. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take years and decades for some populations to return to pre-spill 
numbers," the biologists said.

Visitors at California state prisons do not have to submit to automatic strip 
searches or dog searches of their vehicles, according to a court ruling. Marin 
County Superior Court Judge Richard Breiner has issued a permanent injunction 
forbidding dog searches of cars without visitors' written consent. It also 
requires corrections officers at the state's 20 prisons to let visitors leave 
the institutions' parking lots without forfeiting their visit if they refuse to 
allow the search. Strip searches will not be allowed without reasonable cause, 
Breiner said.

Prosecutors Friday introduced more than a dozen photographs of frenzied 
fighting dogs that were taken from the home of the first U.S. pit bull owner 
charged with murder for his animal's actions. The photos, enlargements of 
snapshots taken from Michael Berry, 39, were part of the prosecution's effort 
to show that Berry was deeply involved in dog fighting and trained the animal 
that killed a 2-year-old neighbor, James Soto, who wandered into Berry's yard 
on Jan. 13, 1987. The pit bull, Willy, had been leashed on a six-foot chain and 
guarded a corridor that led to a patch of 243 marijuana plants, according to 
testimony. Berry was initially charged with involuntary manslaughter, but the 
charge was upgraded to second-degree murder in November, 1987, alleging malice 
because Berry had trained Willy to fight and had failed to take proper 
precautions. Willy was ordered put to death, but is currently at the Santa 
Clara County Animal Shelter while his death sentence is appealed.

Inmates at Folsom Prison take out their frustrations by stopping up prison 
toilets with bed sheets or anything else they can get their hands on, state 
water officials said Friday. As a result, raw sewage from the prison overflows 
into the nearby American River. The Central Valley Regional Water Quality 
Control Board issued a cleanup and abatement order at its meeting Friday, 
telling prison authorities to do something about the problem. "The prisoners 
jam sheets and mattress covers down the toilets," said Wayne Pierson, chief of 
the regional water board's regulatory unit. "They also use oranges, shirts and 
plastic bags."

No one is yet predicting a fourth year of drought in Central California, but 
the possibility is on the minds of many San Joaquin Valley growers and 
irrigation water management officials. "There's no sense of panic at this 
point, but if we don't get some rain in the valley and snow in the Sierra in 
the next few weeks, that could change," Robert Leake, manager of the Fresno 
Irrigation District, said Friday. A fourth dry year would be disastrous for 
valley growers who depend on irrigation water for their crops. The panic could 
start before the end of the year because most of the season's rain and snow 
fall in December, January and February.

AN EXCHANGE OF LETTERS ON ABORTION 
</P>
<P>
* William Sloane Coffin and Thomas J. Gumbleton are both active in disarmament 
and social justice organizations and are friends. But they disagree, as do 
their respective organizations, on th1696625257ton. Gumbleton, a Roman Catholic 
bishop in Detroit, is president of Pax Christi U.S.A., the National Catholic 
Peace Movement, based in Erie, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dear Bill, 
</P>
<P>
It is always a pleasure to hear from you and I welcome this exchange of views 
on abortion. I am mindful that as two male leaders of peace organizations, we 
will never have to struggle with it in the same way that many women do. 
Nevertheless, we might begin a respectful, open discussion of our disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
Pax Christi, as you know, rejects "the claim of any individual, any group or 
organization, any nation, to the 'right' to destroy human life, whether singly 
or as entire populations." It saddens me that this separates us from our 
partners on other justice issues. It is no less distressing that so many of our 
"allies" on abortion do not share Pax Christi's position on war, nuclear 
deterrence, capital punishment and feminism. Although you don't mention it in 
your letter, the distortion introduced by labels is a major problem in this 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
However, some who say that they are pro-choice don't really use that rationale 
for other moral problems. Certainly they would never support a racist choice or 
someone's choice to rape. An added irony is that some pro-choice advocates do 
not even defend the pro-lifers' choice to protest. So, to call themselves 
pro-choice is neither correct nor logical. They are only "pro" one particular 
(and we think morally dubious) choice, that of abortion. 
</P>
<P>
We differ somewhat on questions relating to human life. Genetics makes it quite 
definite, to me, that once fertilization is complete, the living entity is 
certainly human. The fertilized egg is living; no one would dispute that. 
Furthermore, it is genetically human. No one can dispute that. Your question, 
therefore, of when it becomes human confuses the issue. The question that 
divides us is: When does nascent human life deserve protection? Why? Or why 
not? Those who are morally pro-choice deny basic protection to the fetus in 
utero. I would assert that the fetus in utero deserves protection. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in my ministry, I have found that "spontaneous abortion" causes serious 
grief, which is often downplayed or ignored. I have learned the importance of 
conducting funeral or memorial services after a miscarriage or stillbirth. Much 
is known about the intense psychological trauma suffered by women who have 
undergone intentional or therapeutic abortions. 
</P>
<P>
On criminalization, we are in substantial agreement, but on somewhat different 
grounds. If Roe vs. Wade were reversed and abortion not considered a 
constitutional right, I still would not want legislation to jail women who 
obtain an abortion. Strident condemnation of desperate women who often are 
already scared and unhappy, and subjecting them to jail besides, almost 
certainly will do more harm than good. Nothing should be done to add to the 
psychological burden of those women who have already suffered greatly in making 
their choice. 
</P>
<P>
Yet I can understand why people promote laws against abortion. If abortion were 
illegal, women could not be pressured to obtain one as the solution to an 
inconvenient or very troubling pregnancy. Furthermore, legalized abortion 
allows our society to escape its responsibility to offer concrete help to poor 
women. Indeed, by offering legalized abortion, society betrays its lack of 
commitment to the value of life and loses an opportunity to use public law as a 
guide to people who want to lead moral lives. 
</P>
<P>
But, as much as I wish that laws against abortion would solve all our problems, 
I do not believe they would. We need above all to change the hearts and minds 
of people. This is really the root of the whole problem. To some extent we have 
put so much effort into getting laws on the books that we have failed to 
persuade people of the basis for our moral stance. Changing hearts and minds is 
always the most difficult task; it is also the most essential. I would like us 
to spend a lot more time and effort on it. If we did, we might come to more 
agreement on the profound moral questions involved. Then the development of the 
legal structure would follow quite quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Pax Christi's position on nuclear weapons is very similar. We teach and 
persuade about the evils of nuclear weapons, but we do not work for legislation 
that would criminalize those who build them. We explain why we believe it wrong 
to target whole cities, but do not seek to jail those willing to push the 
nuclear button. 
</P>
<P>
Rhetoric plays an increasingly influential role in this issue. Much of the 
argumentation in support of the "pro-choice" position minimizes the value of 
the destroyed life. To ignore the potential person whose life process is 
"terminated," to use demeaning terms like "products of conception" or even 
"fetus" as something alive but not important, can build attitudes that too 
easily dismiss the spark of human life already present as nothing more than, as 
one pro-abortion spokesperson put it, "an inch of tissue." 
</P>
<P>
We must be consistent. If the peace movement argues that wholesale destruction 
of life in war is made easier by using terms like "enemy," "gook," "Jap," etc., 
then writing off the "termination" of not-yet-born human beings in similar 
dehumanizing terms can ultimately diminish respect for human dignity itself. 
Similarly, labels and terms such as "murderer" and "baby-killer" used by some 
anti-abortionists are judgmental, demeaning and destructive. 
</P>
<P>
One tragic effect of the controversy is the waste of time and effort that ought 
to be devoted to social programs that would provide alternatives to abortion. 
We need to change structures that cut health-care and food programs, that force 
women and children to live in poverty. This is our common ground and our common 
work. Our groups, and all who value life, need to align our efforts with 
greater determination in these areas. 
</P>
<P>
I know you to be a courageous and compassionate defender of those who are 
denied basic human rights, Bill, and I know that your stance on this issue is 
the result of an honest search for truth. As the Chinese say, "There is my 
truth. There is your truth. And there is the truth." May we continue our search 
together.

BUSH AND GORBACHEV'S MALTA SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The well-kept secret of the Bush bombshell dropped at the very first session of 
the historic summit -- that the 20th summer Olympics be held in Berlin -- had 
little connection to the weighty work at hand (Part A, Dec. 3). It was no great 
appetizer for the momentous menu of world alignment lying ahead. It 
demonstrated Bush's unawareness of the sensitivity, both East and West Europe 
have to the German problem. He likes throwing a wild card in the deck, as in 
Danforth (Quayle). 
</P>
<P>
Did Bush try to preempt the usual Gorbachev by a bold announcement of worldwide 
significance? It fell as flat as the Russian ruble, with the thud of silence.

Observing the pictures of the summit and the participants conferring so 
comfortably despite the pounding storm (Part A, Dec. 3) has set me wondering. 
Was the Soviet liner Maxim Gorky selected as a backdrop for any symbolic 
reason? I've heard complimentary reports about it as a cruise ship from 
Americans who have been its delighted passengers. But more importantly, the 
great Russian writer, after whom the ship is named, held out for hope and 
sustenance despite the sordid surroundings he depicted in czarist Russia. "The 
Lower Depths," as an example.

JUNIOR HIGH DROPOUT PROBLEM BURDENS LOS ANGELES SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In regard to the junior high dropout problem, I would like to voice my support 
of the new program that helps students feel more comfortable in a stressful, 
unfamiliar environment. A more personal relationship between students and 
teachers makes the students want to learn, and the more a student wants to 
learn, the less chance he has of dropping out. Retreats and camping trips can 
make a "loner" feel more secure; therefore, making him want to become involved 
further. Acceptance by eighth graders, through the suggested "adoption," can 
also make fearful newcomers less worried. When other concerns are lightened or 
altogether alleviated, a student can concentrate more on staying in and doing 
well in school. 
</P>
<P>
A larger portion of tax money should be directed towards the schools with a 
high dropout rate. This money should be used to increase the pay of teachers 
who actively participate in school unity projects, to help pay for elective 
classes which are interesting to the student, and to help support a program 
which teaches parents how to encourage their children to stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
The students of today are the future of tomorrow. How do you think our future 
will look when some junior highs have a dropout rate as high as 28%? 
</P>
<P>
With thoughtful planning, our schools will be able to keep more students from 
dropping out, and even truly enjoying school.

<P>
The best news coming out of the summit could well be President Bush's 
announcement to provide U.S. leadership on the global warming issue. The Cold 
War may be over but the "hot war" is just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Bush and his science adviser, D. Allan Bromley, have proved they are both 
rational beings. They saw the scientific evidence, they read the reports, they 
discussed the issue with scientists and they decided that yes, indeed, the 
worldwide threat to the atmosphere from carbon dioxide and other "greenhouse" 
gases is very real and must be dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
The "hot war" -- finding solutions to reducing greenhouse gases and ozone 
destruction -- will be a lot easier than solving the Cold War. We know what the 
problems are. We have some solutions. And most of the world agrees that 
something must be done about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Goodby Cold War, hello hot war! Hey! That's actually good news.

USE OF ADC LAWYERS IN COURTROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is clear from the editorial that the author's opinion of the Alternate 
Defense Counsel was based upon misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
For the past six years the attorneys of the Alternate Defense Counsel (created 
by Los Angeles County after approximately seven years of planning) have 
provided consistent, quality legal representation to indigent defendants at a 
substantial savings to Los Angeles County taxpayers. ADC has always had a 
year-to-year contract that must be renewed each year by the county after 
careful scrutiny of the quality of legal representation and cost effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, ADC has consistently saved Los Angeles County substantial sums of 
money. The first two years (1983 and 1984), ADC provided legal services in Van 
Nuys and San Fernando courts and saved taxpayers approximately $2 million each 
year. ADC was then expanded to the Westside and downtown, and saved Los Angeles 
County taxpayers approximately $5 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
The many trial judges that The Times claim privately express reservations about 
the quality of legal representation by ADC obviously have never worked with our 
lawyers, or are those few judges who desire to continue to use the "old-boy" 
system of appointment of attorneys regardless of the cost to taxpayers.

JUNIOR HIGH DROPOUT PROBLEM BURDENS LOS ANGELES SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The junior high schools are not in need of overhauling. We need to look under 
the hood of the elementary schools. What are students not learning in 
elementary schools that make all but the self-learners, candidates for failure? 
</P>
<P>
Students who are given the tools to succeed do not dropout, drug out, gang out 
or get pregnant.

<P>
As a former junior high teacher I agree with Ron Sakoda, principal of Gompers 
Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
He recently stated that part of the dropout problem is due to the lack of "fun" 
electives such as wood shop where students could learn some real skills as well 
as have fun. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe if the bloated bureaucracy at LAUSD had not received such huge salary 
increases lately there could have been a few more elective classes.

FONTANA LIVES UP TO BILLING, FINISHES OFF SAN GORGONIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the start of the high school football season, the consensus around 
Southern California was that Fontana High School had the best Division I team 
in the Southern Section. Now it's a fact. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana completed a 14-0 season with a 35-7 victory over Citrus Belt League 
rival San Gorgonio of San Bernardino Friday night before a crowd of 20,583 at 
Anaheim Stadium to win its second Division I championship in the past three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana won the title in 1987 when it defeated Capistrano Valley, 21-0. Over 
the past three seasons, the Steelers are 38-2. 
</P>
<P>
"The second one is just as exciting as the first one," said Dick Bruich, who 
was drenched by his players after improving his playoff record to 20-11 in 13 
years as Fontana's head coach. 
</P>
<P>
San Gorgonio, which only lost to the Steelers, 30-22, in the regular season, 
was overpowered by Fontana and running back Samita Vaoifi, who ran for two 
touchdowns and passed for another. 
</P>
<P>
However, for the second consecutive week, Fontana did not dominate at the 
start. In its 48-35 victory over Edison of Huntington Beach in last week's 
semifinal, the Steelers fell behind by as many as 14 points twice in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Against San Gorgonio, the Steelers were charitable on the game's first play 
when Vaoifi fumbled the opening kickoff on Fontana's 30-yard line. Eight plays 
later, Spartan running back Ron Rivers scored from a yard out to give San 
Gorgonio a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike their game against Edison, the Steelers responded quickly with a 
nine-play, 73-yard touchdown drive, which Vaoifi finished with a 38-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week (against Edison) was a special game, but that only got us here," 
Bruich said. "We had to play this one to win the title." 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 7-7, Fontana's defense forced the Spartans to punt deep 
from their territory, setting up the Steelers' second score. 
</P>
<P>
On a five-play, 30-yard drive, Fontana went to the left arm of Vaoifi, who 
threw a halfback-option touchdown pass to Ron Austin for a 14-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
San Gorgonio began the second half with a long drive into Steeler territory. 
Behind the running of Rivers, who gained 36 yards on the drive, the Spartans 
had a first down on Fontana's 30-yard line before quarterback Marcus McMaryion 
threw an interception to William Ephraim. 
</P>
<P>
After a clipping penalty on Emphraim's return, Fontana went on a nine-play, 
85-yard touchdown drive with the key play being a 52-yard pass from quarterback 
Nick Bennett to Austin. 
</P>
<P>
The pass caught the Spartans by surprise, as Bennett has averaged less than 40 
yards passing per game all season. This would be his only attempt of the game. 
Wingback Kenneth Cannon completed the drive with a 14-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana continued its domination after Cannon's score by not allowing San 
Gorgonio beyond midfield the rest of the game. The Steelers pressured 
McMaryion, who completed only five of 11 passes for 36 yards with two 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers extended their lead to 28-7 to begin the fourth quarter when 
Vaoifi finished off a nine-play, 44-yard drive with an eight-yard touchdown 
run. 
</P>
<P>
"We make it look easy, but every game is tough," said Vaoifi, who gained 95 
yards in 14 carries after his 245-yard performance against Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana's last score came with 5:24 remaining in the game when fullback Robert 
Sylvester scored on a three-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
San Gorgonio, which finished 10-4, had only 129 total yards in offense, with 
Rivers getting 118 of those in 24 carries.

MARATHON: MEMBERS OF THE TEAM IN TRAINING WORK TO CONQUER BOTH THE 26.2-MILE

<TEXT>
<P>
It's too early for visions of sugar plums to be dancing anywhere as yet, but on 
the eve of the San Diego International Marathon, the dreamscapes of some 6,000 
runners will likely include some of the following: 
</P>
<P>
* Leaders looking nervously over their shoulders to see who's breathing down 
their necks. 
</P>
<P>
* First-timers looking nervously over their shoulders to make sure someone's 
breathing down their necks. 
</P>
<P>
* Then there will be the Barbara Egans, wondering how their toenails are 
holding up, and the John Flemings, hoping their bodies aren't tricking them 
into picking up the pace too early. 
</P>
<P>
* The Betty Murphys will be wondering what part of their body they will call 
upon to accommodate that extra six miles, and the Alex Sandies will be planning 
the easiest way to get into and out of their kilts. OK, so only one Alex Sandie 
will actually be doing that. 
</P>
<P>
* And, as will most everyone, the Dennis Ahlmans will be wanting the whole darn 
thing to end. 
</P>
<P>
But Ahlman, the director of the Leukemia Society of San Diego, is one of 24 
runners representing "Team in Training" and as prepared for this 26.2-mile joy 
ride -- his second attempt to finish a marathon in 10 years -- as he'll ever 
be. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little scared but excited," said Ahlman, who commissioned the help of 
Mark Zeisinger, San Diego Athletic Club general manager, and SDAC Fitness 
Director Thom Hunt in forming the Team in Training six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ahlman had worked closely with Zeisinger and Hunt in past Leukemia 
Society-sponsored Coronado bridge races. And he didn't hesitate to approach 
them with his proposal for a unique fund-raiser used in the New York City 
Marathon by the Westchester/Hudson Valley Leukemia Society of New York. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ahlman, flat sums and per-mile pledges raised by the runners added 
$300,000 to the coffers of the New York charity in the last marathon. He felt 
it would work here but wanted to take it a step further by implementing a 
training program as added incentive. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be a great way to raise money and give something to 
first-time runners," Ahlman said. "For the public, the marathon is such a 
nightmare, and this is a service we can provide." 
</P>
<P>
While Team in Training runners are dedicated to raising money for the Leukemia 
Society, the creators are dedicated to preparing members to enjoy the difficult 
run as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Not to take away from it," said Hunt, coach and director of Team in Training 
and the marathon's official spokesman, "but a marathon is something most people 
can do. Some just aren't as sure of it as I am. And I can make it a more 
enjoyable experience." 
</P>
<P>
According to Hunt, two-thirds of the members are first-time marathoners who 
weren't sure they could face the training alone or complete the race. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to do it," he said, "they just had no idea as to how to get 
there." 
</P>
<P>
So Hunt has guided them step by step. In June, eight runners attended the first 
meeting. They ran three miles. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, they have met twice a month to exchange progress reports, take 
long-distance runs and get workout and diet information from Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
"Our program is different," Hunt said. "Some groups are much more specific. The 
running is tied in with the fact that we're here to raise money. It's not as if 
these people hired a personal coach." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not, but members felt Hunt gave them as much coaching and support as if 
they had. 
</P>
<P>
"Thom's both a motivator and expert," said Barbara Egan, a novice who had a 
zero running base when Hunt gently coaxed her into the group. 
</P>
<P>
"No thing was too small to ask of him," she said. "I remember calling him late 
one night telling him my toenail hurt and asking what I should do. He's a 
psychologist and trainer at the same time. There's always something he can help 
you with." 
</P>
<P>
Said John Fleming, a loan officer at Home Federal Bank and former recreational 
runner who has decreased his mile pace by two minutes: "I have a lot of respect 
for him, for his knowledge in training someone." 
</P>
<P>
The group peaked with 35 members, but 24 stuck with the commitment of turning 
in mileage cards and gathering pledges, which in some cases has turned their 
lives topsy-turvy. 
</P>
<P>
"My husband is very sick of this," said Egan, a real estate agent for Paydar 
Properties and a Leukemia Society board member. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt approached Egan because he needed a running partner for beginner Missi 
Santana. The two have since formed a buddy system. Now, Egan is up at 4 daily 
to get in her morning run. 
</P>
<P>
"Your personal life changes because everything revolves around the marathon," 
she said. "I'm a little late to work these days, I wear flat shoes now, my 
eating has changed. And I'm always talking about it. It's a regimented life." 
</P>
<P>
A former swimmer, she said she had always wanted to do a marathon, but lacked 
the discipline. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the perfect opportunity," she said. "I have a running buddy who 
expects me to be there and a coach who expects me to turn in my mileage." 
</P>
<P>
In New York, pledges of $5,000 were required, but each Team in Training member 
is responsible for raising $2,500. So Egan found herself accountable to her 
financial backers as well, some of whom requested periodic training updates. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who were pledging money were always asking me how training was 
going," Egan said. "It's kept me very honest." 
</P>
<P>
The group is linked through a two-fold desire to raise money for the Leukemia 
Society and to eventually finish. 
</P>
<P>
"The common goal is successfully completing the marathon," Fleming said. "It 
doesn't matter how fast. And it's a good way of raising money for a good 
cause." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's San Diego International Marathon was Alex Sandie's first. Sandie, 
of Edinburgh, Scotland, joined Team in Training to help the cause. He will be 
the guy in a full kilt for the first and last miles. 
</P>
<P>
"My training goals were set," he said, "I joined mainly to help raise money. 
But I still benefitted from Thom's knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt said the only criteria for joining Team in Training was the desire to 
raise money for a cause that has his personal interest. 
</P>
<P>
"My stepfather died of leukemia," said Hunt, the 1986 Heart of San Diego 
Marathon winner and four-time NCAA All-American at Arizona. "That made it all 
the more important." 
</P>
<P>
So can Betty Murphy, co-owner of Murphy's Bookkeeping Service. 
</P>
<P>
"I volunteered my services on many other charities, and I always get stuck with 
the bookkeeping," she said. "This seemed like the perfect opportunity. I 
volunteered my services on another level." 
</P>
<P>
Although she has been running 15 years, Murphy's longest races have been 
half-marathons. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so dead after the half, I thought I could never go another 13," Murphy 
said. Then after a Team in Training 20-mile training run, "I told Thom that I 
had absolutely no idea how I'd find another six miles in this body." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt's sure she will. After all, he said, the key to finishing a marathon isn't 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
"Training the body to keep moving for three to five hours," he said. "That's 
the biggest physical challenge. You need to adapt training so it's not too much 
come race day." 
</P>
<P>
For most, the goal isn't a time but a finish that leaves them feeling like 
they'll someday try it again. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to complete the distance and feel good," Egan said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Fleming: "To finish the race pain free is a goal. I'm trying for a 
eight-minute pace for the first 15 miles. If I'm doing good, toward 20 miles, I 
may pick it up." 
</P>
<P>
Fleming is, according to group members, one of the bigger success stories of 
Team in Training. 
</P>
<P>
"John is one of our stars," Ahlman said. "He's lost lots of weight and raised 
lots of money for us." 
</P>
<P>
Fleming, 6-feet, 164 pounds, dropped 16 pounds during the intense training 
regimen. Eighteen months ago, Fleming ran with Hunt's elite group and got a 
lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"It was awful," he said. "Now, most of the time I can keep up with them." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt said the runners' worries include apprehension about proper preparation 
and what they'll eat and drink on the course. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Can I do it? Am I really ready? What will it be like?,' " he said. "Those 
are the kinds of questions they have." 
</P>
<P>
One of Fleming's concerns was the time constraints that training would create. 
</P>
<P>
"I was worried about how time consuming it would be," he said. "Also, that I'd 
have to be disciplined and run when I didn't want to." 
</P>
<P>
Egan said she feared failure. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't sure I had the mental strength," she said, "But Thom is great at 
getting fears away. He's so knowledgeable about the mind and running. He's good 
at convincing you that you do feel good." 
</P>
<P>
Good enough to join Team in Training again next year, which Ahlman said he 
hopes to see. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be an annual event," he said. "We would like to see it really 
take off. We think it will be a major thrust for us." 
</P>
<P>
Sign Murphy up. "I would recommend this to anyone," she said. "If they have it 
next year, I'll do it for sure. I could have never done it on my own." 
</P>

KICKED OUT, HE WAS A FAIR CATCH;

CHARGER OPPONENT: TRADED FROM SAN DIEGO TO WASHINGTON, RALF MOJSIEJENKO LEADS 
THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE IN PUNTING AVERAGE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ralf Mojsiejenko isn't gloating. He is too nice a guy to do that. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the punter who was no longer wanted by the Chargers can't help but feel 
a special sense of satisfaction as he awaits his first meeting with his former 
team as a member of the Washington Redskins. He will go into Sunday's game in 
Washington with the best punting average in the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
While the Chargers have tried two punters in a vain effort to find a 
replacement, Mojsiejenko, 26, has averaged 44.3 yards on 53 punts, including a 
74-yarder that ranks second only to the 91-yard bomb by Philadelphia 
quarterback Randall Cunningham last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Colbert, who beat Mojsiejenko for the Charger job, was such a dismal 
failure that he was released after two games. He averaged 33.3 on eight punts. 
Hank Ilesic then was imported from Canada and has made some spectacular kicks 
but has been inconsistent. He ranks 13th in the league with a 41-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers raised many an eyebrow by trading Mojsiejenko to the Redskins on 
Aug. 29 for a seventh-round draft choice. He had averaged a career-high 44.1 
yards last year and gone to the Pro Bowl the year before, but the Chargers' new 
coaching regime wasn't happy with him. 
</P>
<P>
The reason public consumption was that Dan Henning, who had succeeded Al 
Saunders as head coach, and Joe Madden, who had taken over as special teams 
coach after Wayne Sevier went to the Redskins, preferred a different type of 
punter. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football operations, said after 
trading Mojsiejenko that Colbert's style -- angling the ball away from the 
returner as opposed to kicking it as far as possible -- would fit in better 
with the Chargers' scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that Colbert will give our defense a chance to operate many times 
inside our opponent's 15-yard line," Ortmayer said. 
</P>
<P>
Henning added, "We're looking for position and coverage. Not that we didn't 
think the other guy (Mojsiejenko) could do it, but Colbert is more accurate." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Colbert's punts were neither long nor accurate. And since 
Ilesic arrived, he has put the ball inside the 20 only nine times -- an AFC low 
-- compared to 17 for Mojsiejenko on eight fewer punts. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the importance of the accuracy factor, it was only part of the 
story behind Mojsiejenko's departure. He passed up the Chargers' minicamp, 
saying that Ortmayer had reneged on a promise to renegotiate his contract. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, both Ortmayer and Henning denied that this had anything to do 
with their decision to trade Mojsiejenko. 
</P>
<P>
When Ortmayer was asked about its impact, he said, "Absolutely zero." 
</P>
<P>
When the same question was put to Henning, he said, "There is no hassle. He has 
a contract." 
</P>
<P>
Mojsiejenko didn't buy those denials, and he still doesn't. He talked about the 
reasons behind the trade in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it stems from the dispute, or disagreement, with Mr. Ortmayer," 
Mojsiejenko said. "I held out at minicamp, and that offended him. When I came 
into the regular camp, I still thought we'd get something done, but he didn't 
go for it. 
</P>
<P>
"That was disappointing, since he had pushed for it in '87, when I had my Pro 
Bowl year. He mentioned that he wanted to redo my contract, and I was happy. 
</P>
<P>
"Then he never did anything. It was like giving me candy and taking it back." 
</P>
<P>
Mojsiejenko said his agent, Steve Weinberg, had attempted for months before 
minicamp to strike a deal with Ortmayer but had gotten nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve tried weekly," Mojsiejenko said. "But Mr. Ortmayer didn't return phone 
calls, and he didn't return letters. We were talking to nobody. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that we were being treated unjustly, and that's why I skipped 
minicamp. We felt that they were ignoring me, so I ignored them for a week. By 
that time, they weren't sure I was going to show up at the regular camp. 
</P>
<P>
"But I did show up, and when they told me I was traded, I was shocked. In spite 
of the contract business, I didn't expect anything at all. It took me a couple 
of weeks to adjust to the change." 
</P>
<P>
As for management's criticism of his type of punting, Mojsiejenko said he had 
argued the point without success. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted me to angle the ball to the sidelines, like Lewis (Colbert) was 
doing," he said. "I told them that doesn't work in the NFL anymore. I told them 
sometimes you do that and you don't even get it inside the 20. 
</P>
<P>
"The fans want long punts, not punts that go to the sidelines all the time. You 
can't have good stats that way. If I'd had a 38-yard gross average and a 34 
net, I wouldn't be here. I would have ended up doing what Lewis Colbert ended 
up doing and gotten cut." 
</P>
<P>
Mojsiejenko pointed out that punting for distance creates the possibility of 
big plays that can turn a game around. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had at least three plays this year that wound up with big net yardage," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sevier, a San Diego State alumnus who had coached the Redskins' special teams 
from 1981 through 1986 before spending two seasons with the Chargers, is 
strongly in favor of Mojsiejenko's style. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy with Mojo in San Diego," Sevier said. "He'll line drive a little 
more than go for hang time, but that's OK with me. In most cases, I prefer 
driving the ball to getting it higher. I like the fact that he might get you a 
70-yarder and back up your opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"He has kicked over the top (past the return men) three times this year, and 
all three return men ran it out of the end zone. I never had that happen 
before." 
</P>
<P>
Sevier did admit that Mojsiejenko could improve his position punting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not one of his strong points," Sevier said. "He has a ways to go, but 
he's improving every year. His ratio of 20s (punting inside the 20) to 
touchbacks gets better every year. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very consistent in San Diego. He drives the ball once in a while and 
allows the opposition to get into a return, but that doesn't happen often. And 
there's always the chance that he'll get off a real long one. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's unfair to criticize him. In clutch situations he comes up with 
some great punts, and that's really what you're looking for." 
</P>
<P>
In returning to the Redskins for a second term, Sevier, 48, has been reunited 
with Coach Joe Gibbs, who was a teammate at San Diego State in 1961 and 1962. 
Sevier also had two hitches on the Chargers' staff, the first having been in 
1979 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Sevier's wife is Gibbs' secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up in San Diego," Sevier said. "My four kids and six grandkids have 
grown up there. I miss it. I thought I had a chance to be the head coach (after 
Saunders was fired), but Joe (Gibbs) talked to me right after they made the 
change. He allowed me to pursue the opportunity to be the head coach, but said 
if I didn't get it, I could go back to the Redskins." 
</P>
<P>
The play of the Chargers' special teams has deteriorated since Madden moved 
into Sevier's old job, but Sevier had kind words for Madden. 
</P>
<P>
"Madden is a good coach," Sevier said. "I went against him head-to-head for 
five years when he was with the Detroit Lions, and it was always a great 
matchup. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens is, your special teams can play great for 16 plays, and if they 
have one bad one, that's all anybody remembers." 
</P>
<P>
Sevier pointed out that Madden needed time for his system to work. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me two years," Sevier said. "I look for the Chargers' special teams to 
be great. They scare me to death. The kickoff that Anthony Miller ran back a 
few weeks ago was a thing of beauty. He's scary." 
</P>
<P>
Sevier's input helped the Redskins decide to deal for Mojsiejenko. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought if he was ever available, I'd like to get him," Sevier said. "I 
never thought that would come up, and when it did, I was excited. We didn't 
really have a punter, and we were looking." 
</P>
<P>
Mojsiejenko considers rejoining Sevier a big break. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was going to be traded, this was the best scenario," Mojsiejenko said. "I 
know his system and he knows what to expect of me." 
</P>
<P>
Another trip to the Pro Bowl is a strong possibility, but Mojsiejenko said he 
wasn't counting on it. He noted that three other NFC punters were also having 
big seasons -- Sean Landeta of the New York Giants, Rich Camarillo of the 
Phoenix Cardinals and Jim Arnold of the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Turning his thoughts to his four-year stay with the Chargers, Mojsiejenko said, 
"If you see Mr. Ortmayer, tell him Mojo says 'Hi.' "Give my best to the fans 
out there. I didn't have a chance to thank them for all their support."

OILERS STAY HOT, DEFEAT KINGS, 5-4, IN OVERTIME; 
</P>

HOCKEY: RESURGENT EDMONTON IS 9-1-1 IN ITS LAST 11 GAMES, A STREAK THAT HAS 
TAKEN CLUB FROM LAST TO ATOP THE SMYTHE DIVISION.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is there life after Wayne Gretzky? 
</P>
<P>
Apparently so. 
</P>
<P>
The Edmonton Oilers, decimated by the trading of their superstar to the Kings 
before last season and mired in last place in the Smythe Division three weeks 
ago, are beginning to rise again, bringing shudders from the rest of an NHL 
that remembers all too well the Oiler rampage through the 1980s that resulted 
in four Stanley Cup championships in six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, was largely due to Gretzky, but there are new stars here now, 
several of whom helped the rejuvenated Oilers defeat the Kings Friday night, 
5-4, in overtime, for their sixth consecutive victory. In their last 11 games, 
the Oilers are 9-1-1 to move atop the division. 
</P>
<P>
The winning goal came at 2:03. A pass by Bernie Nicholls was intercepted by 
Oiler right winger Jari Kurri, who skated into the Kings' zone, flipped the 
puck behind him to teammate Petr Klima, then received it back on a pass into 
the right corner. 
</P>
<P>
From there, Kurri passed it in front of the net to the waiting stick of Mark 
Lamb, who was barreling down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
In an instant, Lamb, King goalie Kelly Hrudey, stick and puck all came 
together. 
</P>
<P>
There was little Hrudey could do as Lamb flipped the puck past him, sending the 
Northlands Coliseum crowd of 17,503 home into the snowy night. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an easy goal," Lamb said. "The pass was right on my stick." 
</P>
<P>
Lamb was smiling as he spoke, but that was not the case in the second period 
when he misfired on a breakaway. 
</P>
<P>
"That (the goal) kind of made up for the breakaway," he said. "I had too much 
time to think on that one. There were a million things on my mind. That would 
have made them fold." 
</P>
<P>
It would have made the score 5-2 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
In losing anyway, the Kings (14-12-2) fell five points behind the Oilers 
(15-10-5). 
</P>
<P>
It certainly didn't appear the game would be close in the second period, when 
the Oilers took a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the Kings crept back and tied the score in the third period on a Gretzky 
power-play goal. 
</P>
<P>
Standing behind the Oiler net at the 14:30 mark, Getzky pushed the puck into 
the crease, where it caromed off the skate of Adam Graves into the net. 
</P>
<P>
"I just threw it in front and it hit Adam in the skate," Gretzky said. "It was 
just one of those lucky goals. It happens." 
</P>
<P>
It was Gretzky's 13th goal of the season and his fourth on the power play. 
Earlier, he had extended his scoring streak to 14 games with an assist. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton defenseman Randy Gregg opened the scoring with his first goal of the 
season. Taking a perfect pass from Klima in the left corner, Gregg -- wide open 
-- smacked the puck in at 6:10 of the first period. Lamb also got an assist on 
the play. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers' other goal of the period came on a power play at 15:21, Mark 
Messier scoring his 19th of the season from the middle of the right circle. It 
was his sixth power-play goal, with assists going to Steve Smith and Charlie 
Huddy. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' offense went from weak to non-existent. They took only six shots on 
goal in the period, none in the last 8 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But early in the second period, the Kings got back in the game on a power play 
goal initiated by Luc Robitaille. From behind the net, Robitaille flipped the 
puck out to Gretzky, who passed it to Steve Duchesne. Duchesne responded with 
his eighth goal of the season at 1:51 and the Kings had pulled to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
But the Oilers came back with two second-period goals. The first came on a shot 
by Craig Simpson, who scored his 11th goal at 7:04, past goalie Hrudey on his 
short side with the assist to Glenn Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
The second came on a power play. Kurri fired a shot that Hrudey deflected off 
the boards. The rebound came back to Klima, who backhanded it in at 12:47. It 
was Klima's sixth goal, his third on a power play. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings got their second goal at 15:43 when Duchesne carried the puck to the 
goal mouth. There it was pushed away by goalie Grant Fuhr. But John Tonelli 
followed the puck across the goal mouth and pushed it back in. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings again pulled to within one when Mike Krushelnyski scored a 
short-handed goal at 7:45 of the final period. 
</P>
<P>
"We showed a lot of character coming back," Hrudey said. "We stuck our noses in 
it. To lose then was a bit of a heartbreak." 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Much of the world may be intrigued by the Soviets, but apparently not Edmonton. 
Wednesday's exhibition game here between the Oilers and Khimik Voskresensk, a 
touring Soviet squad, drew only 6,804, smallest crowd ever in Northlands 
Coliseum. . . . How big was the game to the Oilers? "It was better than 
practicing," said Edmonton Coach John Muckler. . . . Because Khimik played the 
Kings earlier in the week, Soviet Coach Vladimir Vasiliev was asked by an 
Edmonton Journal reporter to compare the two squads. "The Oilers are much 
stronger," Vasiliev said. "It seems to me they have more superstars than Los 
Angeles. Of course, it goes without saying (Wayne) Gretzky is superstar No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
Another Edmonton paper, the Sun, is asking its readers to pick the newsmaker of 
the decade. Among the top choices are both Gretzky and Peter Pocklington, the 
man who traded him to the Kings.

In answer to Earl Gustkey's story, "No Mas Still Baffles Experts": What 
experts?

<P>
I ain't no expert but I don't think Duran just had it within himself to take 
the dive he was supposed to take. He obviously did the obvious "No Mas'' and 
walked away.

Pay-per-view fights should come complete with a money-back guarantee. If the 
performance isn't appealing by the midway point, you can call in and ask for a 
refund. I'd rather watch a Rocky film. Or the WWF. 
</P>

Cease boxing's Senior Circuit before one of them actually has to throw a punch.

I am only 26 and was not around for the birth of the now famous and widely 
accepted "gutty little Bruins" notion, but I don't subscribe to it. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA was 5-4-1 against USC in the 1980s, and three of the four losses were by a 
total of nine points. The Bruins had an average margin of victory of 11.2 
points in their five wins over USC. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sorry to confuse USC fans with the facts, but UCLA had the upper hand in 
the 1980s. I wish the "gutty little Trojans" better luck in the 1990s.

EVEN IN VICTORY, SOME FIND REASONS TO COMPLAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the Raider coaching change and the resurgence of Raider football, I 
couldn't understand why only 40,000 fans would attend the next several games. 
</P>
<P>
I found out why last Sunday, as I was one of the 90,000 fans who attended the 
Denver game. 
</P>
<P>
Either the Raider coaching staff is stupid or they are quitters. When you are 
behind, 10-6, and you have a first-and-10 on your 30-yard line with 30 seconds 
remaining, it is permissible to attempt to advance the ball! 
</P>
<P>
Whadaya know? The Raiders won anyway. I saw fans leaving in the fourth quarter 
while the game was tied. Some fans are quitters, too.

Regarding Alma Kenyon's challenge to all of Terry Donahue's detractors to take 
up coaching and see if they could do better, I quote Samuel Johnson on 
criticism: "You may scold a carpenter who has made you a bad table, though you 
cannot make a table, it is not your trade to make tables." 
</P>

It doesn't take an Al Davis to realize that Donahue has the motivational skills

TREVINO TRAILS BIES BY 6 SHOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Trevino fought off a balky putter and shot another 69, but fell another 
shot off the pace at Royal Kaanapali Golf Club in Hawaii Friday in the second 
round of his debut on the Senior PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
His 36-hole total of 138 left him six shots behind leader Don Bies going into 
Saturday's final round of the Kaanapali tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I can win it now," said Trevino. "Not the way Bies is playing. 
I'd have to shoot nine-under to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Bies, playing in the same group with Trevino, shot an eight-under 64 and was at 
132. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Douglass, who hasn't made a bogey in the tournament, was alone at 133 
after a 67. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Coody, with a 65, and Tom Shaw, whose 66 included a double bogey from 
the pond on the final hole, were tied at 135. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Littler, with a 68, and first-round leader Joe Jimenez were next at 137. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino, five shots back at the start of the day, birdied three of his first 
six holes and appeared ready to make a run at the lead. 
</P>
<P>
But his putter went bad on the back nine, and he was shaking a graying head and 
muttering and mumbling in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"My putter got me. But I'm not surprised," said Trevino, who predicted early in 
the week that his fortunes would ride on his putter. 
</P>
<P>
South African David Frost had eight birdies en route to a six-under-par 66 and 
took a three-stroke lead in Sun City, South Africa, at the halfway point of the 
Million Dollar Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Frost, playing better than when he won the World Series of Golf in August, 
ended the storm-interrupted round with a total of 133, 11-under-par. 
</P>
<P>
American Tim Simpson, who played steadily but dropped a shot at the eighth hole 
when he hurried a putt during a lightning flash, was in second place at 136. 
Simpson, who shot a 69, and Frost had shared the opening-round lead with Scott 
Hoch, another American, after shooting 67s. 
</P>
<P>
Hoch played the second round in par 72 and fell to third place at 139, six 
strokes behind Frost. 
</P>
<P>
"I gather they didn't roll the greens today, which meant they were a lot 
slower, and I kept leaving my putts short," Hoch said. 
</P>
<P>
Blaine McCallister and Charlie Epps capped a round of 60 with their second 
eagle of the day on the final hole to take a one-stroke after the second round 
of the Chrysler PGA Team Championships at the Cypress Course in Wellington, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
McCallister and Epps had a seven-under-par 29 on the back nine. Their 36-hole 
score of 123, 21 under par, is one stroke better than the teams of Rick 
Fehr-Kent Kluba and Mike Hulbert-Bob Tway.

49ERS WIN DATE WITH INDIANA;

LONG BEACH: A 68-47 VICTORY OVER NEW HAMPSHIRE SETS UP GAME AGAINST NO. 14 
HOOSIERS IN TOURNAMENT FINAL.

Assembly Hall was nearly empty by the time Cal State Long Beach wrapped up its 
fourth consecutive victory, 68-47, over the University of New Hampshire Friday 
night in the Indiana tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the game was played before only a few hundred quiet fans, those that 
remained from a crowd of 13,702 that had watched Indiana defeat South Alabama, 
96-67, in the opening game. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere will be different tonight when the 49ers and 14th-ranked 
Indiana, both undefeated, meet in the championship game. The Hoosiers, who have 
a 31-0 record in this tournament, will be trying to win it for the 16th year in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, scoring in spurts, led all the way against New Hampshire, which 
shot only 36.7% from the field. But the 49ers made 19 turnovers, 15 in the 
second half. And their five steals were 10 below their average. 
</P>
<P>
"We were somewhat lethargic," Long Beach Coach Joe Harrington said. "It was 
probably hard for us to get up, we might have been looking ahead to Indiana. I 
think we felt we could turn it on anytime we wanted. The small crowd didn't 
bother us; we always play in front of small crowds." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers had a difficult time pulling away from the Wildcats until guard 
Lucious Harris scored five points in the last six seconds of the first half. 
After hitting a three-point shot, he stole the ball and made a layup at the 
buzzer to make the halftime lead, 36-22. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats never got closer than 13 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
All 13 players scored for Long Beach, which was led by guard Tyrone Mitchell, 
who scored 11 points, and forward Frankie Edwards, who had 10. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant Davis scored 11 points to lead New Hampshire (1-3). 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, Indiana (5-0) outscored South Alabama, 53-33, in the second 
half. Calbert Cheaney, one of four starting freshmen for the Hoosiers, scored 
20 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've escalated our play in each game," said Hoosier Coach Bob Knight, 
whose team is 5-0. Indiana shot 56% from the field and had a 49-26 rebounding 
advantage over the Jaguars (2-3). 
</P>
<P>
"Indiana looked strong," Harrington said. "They pass the ball well and play 
good defense. I think it will be a great experience for us, playing in a 
championship game before a full, hostile house."

DIVISION VI FINAL;

LUCAS, KEHRLI LEAD CORONA DEL MAR, 21-10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Todd Kehrli, Corona del Mar High School quarterback, accomplished quite a bit 
in the first half of the Sea Kings' Southern Section Division VI championship 
game against La Quinta Friday night at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
He completed 10 of 14 passes for 159 yards, and threw a 49-yard touchdown pass 
to receiver Weston Johnson. The trouble was that was all the scoring Corona del 
Mar could produce and the Sea Kings led by just four points at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Kehrli, a sophomore, accomplished much more just by handing the ball to running 
back Brian Lucas on Corona del Mar's first play of the second half. Lucas ran 
94 yards for a touchdown that lifted the Sea Kings' spirits and sent them on to 
a 21-10 victory before 7,500. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive Division VI championship for Corona del Mar 
(11-3). Last season, the Sea Kings defeated Valencia, 17-7. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta, which finished the season 9-5, was playing in its first championship 
game since it lost to Saddleback, 34-28, in the 1985 Central Conference title 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, at the start of the season I thought (winning another title) was a 
possibility," Corona del Mar Coach Dave Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar's defense limited La Quinta to just one touchdown -- a 10-yard 
pass from quarterback Richard Weaver to Trent Julian -- and a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings had two interceptions, including one by Mark Perlmutter that 
snuffed a fourth quarter drive by La Quinta when the Aztecs trailed, 21-10. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs had the ball on the Corona del Mar eight-yard line, and Weaver, 
trying to run away from pressure, threw the ball right to Perlmutter. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised he threw it," Perlmutter said. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta Coach Roger Takahashi said the interception was the turning point. 
</P>
<P>
"We still had a chance," Takahashi said. "We needed two scores to win. We 
needed a touchdown and the two-point conversion and then a field goal." 
</P>
<P>
After Perlmutter's interception, La Quinta never got close to scoring again. 
</P>
<P>
"The offense really moved the ball in the second half," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest play was the long touchdown run by Lucas, who finished with 164 
yards in 20 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of big plays, but that swung the momentum our way," Holland 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kehrli, who completed 11 of 17 for 159 yards and ran two yards for a 
third-quarter touchdown that gave Corona del Mar a 21-3 lead, had a good view 
of the play. 
</P>
<P>
"I just looked up and hoped he wouldn't get caught," he said.

Keith Brockie recovered a bad center snap in the end zone in the second quarter 
to give Corona High School a 14-10 lead, and the Panthers rode that margin into 
their first Southern Section Division V football championship, beating Moreno 
Valley Canyon Springs Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Springs (12-2) opened up a 10-point lead in the first quarter on a 
45-yard touchdown pass play from Kevin Gormont to Eric Zomalt and a 24-yard 
field goal by Richard Couch. 
</P>
<P>
Corona (10-4) countered with 14 second-quarter points on six-yard touchdown 
pass from Steve Bernier to Gabe Rincon and Keith Brockie's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
The second half was dominated by the defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Corona, the No. 3 team from the Mountain View League, lost earlier in the year 
to league runner-up Canyon Springs, 34-12. Corona defeated league champion 
Norco, 28-14, last week in the semifinals.

Carpinteria's B.J. Shamblin caught a three-yard pass from Coley Candaele with 
17 seconds remaining to give Carpinteria a 24-21 win over Tehachapi Friday 
night at San Marcos High in the Southern Section Division IX title game. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Carpinteria its second title in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Carpinteria, which finished the season 13-1, jumped to a 10-0 lead when Jose 
Hernandez scored on a 17-yard run and Robert Villa added a 25-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Tehachapi's tandem of quarterback Ryan Grimes and receiver La Vail Johnson then 
went to work and scored on touchdowns of 65, 22 and nine yards. The third score 
gave Techahapi (12-2) a 21-17 fourth-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
Candaele finished the game with 13 completions in 25 attempts for 137 yards. 
Izak Ondre was Carpinteria's leading rusher with 108 yards in 15 carries.

FAMILIARITY BREEDS GOOD MATCHUPS IN TONIGHT'S FINALS;

<P>
3-A CHAMPIONSHIP (8 P.M.): STRATEGIES WON'T BE A MYSTERY WHEN MORSE TAKES 
ANOTHER RUN AT RANCHO BUENA VISTA.

<P>
The football game that should have been played last year wasn't. Instead, it 
was played at the beginning of this season. 
</P>
<P>
Then, both teams won -- sort of. And both teams lost -- sort of. 
</P>
<P>
And now they have come full circle: Rancho Buena Vista and Morse for the San 
Diego Section 3-A championship at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium tonight at 8. 
</P>
<P>
Got all that? 
</P>
<P>
RBV played in the matinee game in the stadium last year and defeated San 
Pasqual, 21-10, for the section 2-A championship. Morse played in the second 
game of the annual double-header and defeated Orange Glen, 31-28, in the 3-A 
title game. 
</P>
<P>
They were two outstanding football teams, and local high school football fans 
wondered, what if? . . . 
</P>
<P>
The answer came this fall when RBV opened at home Sept. 9 against Morse. RBV, 
now playing in 3-A, won handily, 35-20. But a month later, the Longhorns 
discovered they had used an ineligible player -- a 14-year-old -- and ended up 
with two forfeits. Morse was one of them, so the Tigers got a victory that 
still felt like a loss. 
</P>
<P>
By now, there are very few secrets between these two. After 10 regular season 
and three playoff games, plus scouting trips and film sessions, Morse and RBV 
know each other very well. 
</P>
<P>
That's why tonight's game will come down to a simple battle for ball control. 
RBV (10-3), with it's fabulous rushing game, will try to keep it. Morse (11-2) 
will try to take it away. 
</P>
<P>
To do that, Morse Coach John Shacklett will use a five-man defensive front and 
attempt to match up with the Longhorns. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to get too fancy -- we're not talking brain surgery here," 
Shacklett said. "We'll just try to match up and play smash-'em football." 
</P>
<P>
He is wary of an RBV running game that has yet to be stopped. The Longhorns 
have scored 601 points this season (46.2 a game), a section record. They are 
309 yards short of breaking their year-old state record of 5,540 yards rushing 
in a season. Fullback O.J. Hall (2,002 yards) and tailback Markeith Ross 
(1,948) are about to become the first teammates in California history to each 
go over 2,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But Shacklett isn't scared. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a good high school football team," he said. "They're not ready to take 
on the Chargers. It's just one of those years for them." 
</P>
<P>
Morse, which has advanced to the section championship game the past three 
seasons, has several big-play threats of its own. Start with quick, shifty 
quarterback Teddy Lawrence, who can beat you through the air (1,527 yards 
passing this season) and on the ground (505 rushing). Then look to his favorite 
target, wide receiver David Dunn. In Morse-RBV I this year, Lawrence and Dunn 
hooked up for three touchdown passes -- 54, 32 and eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
And the Morse running game certainly is capable. Jessie Campbell (1,347 yards) 
and Ututofo Faime (803) get the bulk of the work. 
</P>
<P>
So RBV will have to play a little defense, too. 
</P>
<P>
"The less time Teddy and the boys have the ball, the more time we have to 
control it," RBV Coach Craig Bell said. "I'm probably not doing justice to the 
rest of their athletes, but Lawrence handles the ball on every play. 
</P>
<P>
"Morse is quick, probably the quickest team we've played. And they're very 
poised." 
</P>
<P>
RBV's only on-field loss in its past 27 games came this season to Point Loma, 
42-35. RBV got another crack at Point Loma in the section semifinals. The 
Longhorns won, 56-36. They didn't punt once. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to get into matching scores with them," Shacklett said. "I'd like to 
force them to punt a couple of times."

SWEETWATER STANDS TOO TALL FOR MIRA MESA; 
</P>
<P>
BIG GAME: LACK OF HEIGHT DIDN'T LEAVE THE RED DEVILS SHORT IN THEIR 87-68 
VICTORY OVER MARAUDERS.

<P>
Sweetwater High players do not particularly care that their tallest player, 
Carlos Campbell, is 6-feet-4. They are seemingly unbothered that the next 
tallest is two inches shorter. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater feels it can win it all. Not just the Hilltop Invitational, in which 
it will play for the championship at 5:15 p.m. today against Kearny. The Red 
Devils think they can win the San Diego Section Division I championship. 
</P>
<P>
No. 10 Mira Mesa (1-3) would be hard pressed to argue. No. 5 Sweetwater (4-0) 
defeated the Marauders, 87-68, Friday evening at Hilltop. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a good chance," Sweetwater's Joe McDowell said. "But we don't 
want to get big-headed. It's still too early in the season." 
</P>
<P>
Early in Friday's game, Sweetwater looked unstoppable. The Red Devils raced to 
an 23-8 lead after just five minutes and was in front, 27-14, after one 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Mesa slowly got its inside game working -- namely Marc Ziegler, who had 21 
points and 10 rebounds -- to pull within 54-49 late in the third quarter, but 
Sweetwater went on a 14-2 run to re-assume command. An 8-0 run gave Sweetwater 
its biggest lead, 78-59, with 3:02 left. 
</P>
<P>
"We just played our strategy like we always play," McDowell said. "We got a 
little sloppy, but then we cleaned that up." 
</P>
<P>
McDowell (6-2) had 26 points and 11 rebounds, despite sitting out the final 
8:44 of the first half after falling on his right wrist. He said he first 
injured it in a physical education class earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
John Gilbert (6-2) added 22 points and six rebounds, including four 
three-pointers. Campbell had 11 points and six rebounds despite injuring his 
lower back in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Off the bench, Sweetwater's Juan Martinez (5-9) had 11 points, including making 
five of five free throws. Melvin Rushing (6-0) made eight of eight free throws, 
all in the fourth quarter, for eight points. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys coming off the bench was the main factor," Sweetwater Coach David 
Ybarra said. "They really stood out today." 
</P>
<P>
Said Campbell, "We've got a real balanced team. We don't depend on just one or 
two guys." 
</P>
<P>
Other than 6-4 Ziegler, Mira Mesa had only one other player in double-figure 
scoring -- Kal Chatham with 11. 
</P>
<P>
And what of that size disadvantage? Sweetwater outrebounded Mira Mesa, 36-32.

USIU Coach Gary Zarecky isn't deluding himself going into today's game at 
Arkansas. He just hopes that the Gulls have their pride intact when they leave 
Fayetteville. 
</P>
<P>
This was not the case when USIU played at then No. 17 Oklahoma two weeks ago. 
The Sooners ran to a 97-45 lead -- at halftime. Oklahoma went on to win, 
173-101, and took the heart out of a team that came to town with a 2-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls have a five-game losing streak but seem to have rebounded from what 
Zarecky termed "utter devastation" at Oklahoma. USIU was competitive in losses 
to California and Loyola Marymount at home this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to go into Arkansas with things in perspective," Zarecky said. "We're 
just looking to get into our 11-game home stand against teams our own caliber." 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls are led by guard Kevin Bradshaw, who scored a school-record 54 points 
in a 152-137 loss to Loyola Thursday. Bradshaw is averaging 30 points and 
Demetrius Laffitte 18. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas is led by guard Todd Day (20.5) and forward Lenzie Howell (16.5). RICK

ROBERT MONDAVI WINERY TO BUY BYRON VINEYARD 
</P>

The Robert Mondavi Winery has agreed to acquire Byron Vineyard &amp; Winery in 
Santa Barbara County, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
The deal would further expand Mondavi's extensive land holdings along 
California's Central Coast. It follows the 1987 purchase by Mondavi of more 
than 1,000 acres of vineyards in Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
No purchase price was announced, but sources said the transaction amounts to 
more than $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase, which is expected to be completed on March 1, includes a modern 
winery built in 1984, 175 acres of vineyards, and inventory of 20,000 cases of 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
Byron was founded by Ken Brown, Byron's general manager and wine maker and 
formerly wine maker at nearby Zaca Mesa Winery; grape grower Dale Hampton; Los 
Angeles television producer Douglas Cramer, and investor Howard Wilkening. When 
health problems prompted Wilkening to sell his share, Brown suggested the 
partners call the Mondavis. Brown will be retained in his present positions. 
</P>
<P>
The Mondavi-Byron deal is the second major acquisition of a Central Coast 
Winery by a Napa Valley winery. Two years ago, Beringer Vineyards bought 
Estrella River Winery in Paso Robles and changed its name to Meridian. Also, 
Kendall-Jackson of Lake County owns large vineyard holdings in the area.

GOVERNMENT DEALT A BLOW IN LINCOLN CASE; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: A PHOENIX BUSINESSMAN TESTIFIES THAT ALLEGED SHAM TRANSACTIONS WERE 
LEGITIMATE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Phoenix businessman dealt a blow Friday to the government's case against the 
former operators of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine by testifying that two 
land deals federal regulators had characterized as sham transactions were 
legitimate sales. 
</P>
<P>
The businessman, Phillip Gordon, also said in federal court here that some of 
the loan documentation that regulators required of Lincoln went beyond normal 
business practices in the purchase and sale of undeveloped land in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon's testimony appeared to undermine the government's contention that the 
deals were representative of a series of fraudulent transactions in which the 
S&amp;L recorded bogus profits so it could send tax payments to its parent 
company, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, who also is a member of the Phoenix planning commission, was called by 
the government to testify in the second day of hearings in a lawsuit brought by 
American Continental to challenge the April 14 seizure of Lincoln by federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which filed for bankruptcy on April 13, claims that regulators 
lacked sufficient grounds to seize Lincoln, which is expected to become the 
most expensive thrift failure ever at a cost to taxpayers of $2 billion or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr. had been subpoenaed to 
testify at the hearing but he was not called to the stand Friday and will not 
be required to appear until the hearing resumes in early January. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for American Continental were clearly encouraged by Gordon's testimony 
about the land deals, which included his partnership's purchase of 445 acres in 
Hidden Valley Ranch, an undeveloped master-planned community 35 miles southwest 
of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon's testimony showed that the deals had "economic substance" for Lincoln 
and that "fair value" was paid, said John Lundin, one of American Continental's 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
But James P. Murphy, a lawyer for the Office of Thrift Supervision, said that 
the testimony provided the necessary facts to show that Lincoln and Gordon had 
simply engaged in a land swap, not separate property sales, and that the 
S&amp;L wrongly booked profits from the deals. 
</P>
<P>
After the day's hearing, Murphy said the circular transaction was "exactly the 
kind of speculative deals" that led to Lincoln's downfall. "And now we're 
paying for it," he said, referring to the taxpayer bailout.

BOESKY GETS A HAIRCUT, MOVES TO HALFWAY HOUSE IN BROOKLYN

Wall Street inside trader Ivan F. Boesky is out of prison and serving the last 
part of his three-year sentence on the outside as a resident of a halfway 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky reported to the Brooklyn Community Corrections Center on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky was sentenced Dec. 18, 1987, and has served his sentence at the minimum 
security prison at Lompoc, Calif. The former Wall Streeter was scheduled for 
release April 4, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Boesky has shed the shaggy beard and long hair he was spotted sporting last 
month on a furlough in Connecticut. His beard and hair had been trimmed when he 
was seen returning to the halfway house in a rented auto just before the 6 p.m. 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
If Boesky finds work, his curfew stretches to 9 p.m., and he will be eligible 
for a weekend pass. The once-powerful stock speculator, who agreed to pay $100 
million in penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle civil 
charges, would have to turn over 25% of his earnings to the halfway house.

AMR Close to Buying Some Eastern Routes: AMR Corp., the parent of American 
Airlines, is close to striking an agreement to buy Eastern Airlines' profitable 
Latin American routes for between $300 million and $400 million, an industry 
source said. "It is very close," said the source, who asked not to be 
identified. Officials at Eastern, a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., and at 
American declined to comment. Two weeks ago, however, American officials 
confirmed that the two airlines had held discussions about the sale of the 
Latin routes for several months and that talks had resumed in early November.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: DECODING MORTGAGE PAYMENT SCHEDULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI

<P>
QUESTION: I recently got a $135,000 second mortgage on my house. It is a 
30-year, fixed-rate loan with an interest rate of 11%. We signed the documents 
on Nov. 20, and got our money on Nov. 27. We were given a choice of a payment 
due date, and we selected the fifth of the month. We were told that our first 
payment of $1,311.66 was due Dec. 5. Why should a full payment be due when we 
only had the money for nine days? Our loan officer wasn't much help when we 
asked. -- K. C. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Actually, the answer is quite simple. Mortgage interest is prepaid for 
the month. So, the payment you made on Dec. 5 was for the period between that 
date and Jan. 5. Your Jan. 5 payment is for the following month, and so on 
until the loan is paid off. 
</P>
<P>
You might also check the terms of your loan. It is possible that you have 10 or 
15 days after the due date in which to make the mortgage payment before being 
subject to a penalty charge. 
</P>
<P>
This extension effectively allows you to split the month with your lender; you 
prepay two weeks interest and post-pay the other two. As you might imagine, 
lenders don't like you to do this. Also, if you should ever accidentally miss 
the final payment date, you are subject to a substantial late charge. So, it 
makes sense to pay close attention to the terms of your agreement with your 
lender. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When to Write Off a Sour Investment 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am one of the many unfortunate holders of unsecured debentures issued by 
American Continental, parent of Lincoln Savings. I invested $12,000 in the 
debentures and now that American Continental is in bankruptcy, I have little 
reason to believe that I will get my money back. 
</P>
<P>
I know I can write the investment off on my taxes, but when? I am getting lots 
of conflicting opinions. Some say I can do it this year; others say I have to 
wait until the bankruptcy proceedings are completed. Help! -- L. I. H. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your plea is one we have been hearing often in recent months. So, our advice 
bears repeating. 
</P>
<P>
Despite what you have heard, the Internal Revenue Service has no set rules on 
when you can declare a capital loss, which is what you have. The only guideline 
is that you can declare the loss when it can be "reasonably determined" that 
your investment is actually worthless. 
</P>
<P>
Is that when bankruptcy proceedings are completed? Perhaps, but a bankruptcy 
does not even have to be filed for the determination to be made. You must only 
have reasonable and sufficient evidence to support your conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
As we have said, this is a fine line that you unfortunate investors must walk 
because if you are overly pessimistic, the government can force you to refile 
your tax form and assess a penalty for your judgment error. And if you wait too 
long to make the assessment, you could lose the writeoff entirely because the 
IRS imposes a three-year statute of limitations on capital loss deductions. 
</P>
<P>
That said, our tax advisers say taking the loss on American Continental 
debentures this year is probably a sound bet given the company's current 
situation.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: SAVINGS BONDS TO SHED UGLY DUCKLING IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Think of all those "no-brainer" investments -- the ones you buy but don't think 
about a lot. Certificates of deposit. Passbook savings accounts. Treasury 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
Many people put U.S. savings bonds on that list too. Pretty boring, you 
probably think. But that's a mistake, especially now. Starting next month, 
savings bonds will require a lot more thought, while becoming arguably the most 
attractive tax-deferred investment anywhere for eligible investors. 
</P>
<P>
Series EE bonds purchased after Jan. 1 will become exempt from federal tax if 
you meet certain age and income criteria and use the proceeds to pay for the 
college education of your dependents, yourself or your spouse. 
</P>
<P>
Even without this change, savings bonds already are one of the best and safest 
tax-deferred investments. They are already exempt from state and local tax. In 
addition, you can defer paying federal tax until the bonds mature or you redeem 
them -- probably the most important, yet unheralded, advantage of savings 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
That feature in many ways makes them superior to zero-coupon Treasury bonds, 
which receive most of the publicity and are touted as long-term savings 
vehicles. That is because zeros, unlike savings bonds, are taxed annually even 
though you don't receive the interest until they mature (meaning that you are 
taxed on money you don't even have!). 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the interest on savings bonds, while competitive, also enjoys a 
sort of insurance policy against falling rates. The annual rate can't go any 
lower than 6% if you hold them at least five years. But there is no limit to 
how high they can go, because rates are variable and pegged to 85% of the 
five-year Treasury note rate. So if we have another round of double-digit rates 
similar to those of the late 1970s and early 1980s, rates on savings bonds will 
be adjusted upward to reflect that. 
</P>
<P>
This tax deferral and interest protection makes savings bonds "probably the 
most attractive vehicle for someone looking for absolute certainty they won't 
lose their principal," says William F. Brennan, a partner at the accounting 
firm of Ernst &amp; Young in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the latest bonus: the new tax exemption for college expenses, passed 
by Congress in 1988 to help ease the increasing burden of paying for higher 
education. That tax break can make an already decent yield on bonds too juicy 
to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
If you are in the 28% tax bracket, for example, the current 6.98% rate on 
savings bonds becomes equivalent to a 9.69% rate in a taxable investment such 
as a CD or money market fund. That's pretty darn good. 
</P>
<P>
But getting such a tax-free yield is not automatic. 
</P>
<P>
There are several conditions and complications. First, to qualify for the tax 
break, you must be at least 24 years old when you buy the bond. And you can use 
the proceeds only for college expenses of your dependents, yourself or your 
spouse. 
</P>
<P>
The tax break also will apply only if you use bond proceeds for tuition and 
required fees, not for books and room and board. And it will apply only to 
degree programs at colleges, universities and certain vocational schools. It 
won't work at for-profit vocational schools such as those teaching cosmetology, 
auto mechanics, secretarial skills and the like. 
</P>
<P>
To keep rich folks from using savings bonds as a tax shelter, the rules also 
call for the tax break to be phased out if you are married filing jointly with 
modified adjusted gross income between $60,000 and $90,000, or if you are a 
single filer with income between $40,000 and $55,000. Below those levels, you 
get the full break and above them, you will receive no federal tax exemption. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, those phase-out levels will be indexed to inflation, so they will 
rise in future years, notes Stephen Meyerhardt, manager of public affairs for 
the Treasury Department's savings bond division. You'll need that, because 
eligibility for the tax break is determined by your income at the time that you 
cash in the bonds, not when you buy them. If you hold them to maturity, that 
can be 10 to 12 years from now.

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market closed higher Friday as weak employment data fired up hopes 
for lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 10.66 to 2,731.44, winding up the 
week with a net loss of 16.21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 813 up, 646 down and 525 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported Friday morning that the civilian unemployment 
rate increased 0.1 percentage point to 5.4% in November. 
</P>
<P>
The figures showed a gain of 210,000 in non-farm payroll employment, after an 
October increase in jobs that was revised sharply downward to 93,000. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that painted a picture of continued softness in some major 
sectors of the economy, apparently improving the chances for further moves by 
the Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy in the weeks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers among the blue chips included Coca-Cola, up 1 1/8 at 78; Du Pont, up 
1/8 at 120 7/8; Exxon, up 3/8 at 49; Sears Roebuck, up 3/8 at 38, and Chrysler, 
up 1/2 at 19 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Pfizer, which projected slightly lower earnings for the fourth quarter, tumbled 
4 3/8 to 69 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Tonka Corp. lost 2 1/2 to 11 1/4. The company lowered its revenue estimate for 
the year, citing slower-than-expected sales during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
That prompted selling as well in the shares of Toys R Us, which was down 1 3/4 
at 35 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, several stocks that had run up dramatic gains earlier in the year 
came under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Federal National Mortgage led the active list, down 2 at 34 5/8, and Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage fell 3 1/2 to 72 5/8. Brokers said the stocks have suffered 
lately from concern about the outlook for real estate credit. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. Gear slumped 3 3/8 to 30 3/8. A Wall Street Journal article said the 
footwear manufacturer faced the "perils of shifting fads." 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 144.91 million shares, down from 161.98 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, a technical correction and some early index-linked selling dragged 
share prices lower Friday, giving pause to an almost uninterrupted four-week 
rally. The Nikkei 225-share index dropped 134.05 points to 37,724.06, reversing 
its 203.82-point gain on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks closed higher on buying for a long three-week account, which 
starts Monday. The Financial Times 100-share index ended up 16.8 points at 
2,363.5. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Rally in Response to Data 
</P>
<P>
In the credit markets, the unemployment report sparked a rally in government 
bond prices, sending interest rates lower. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond jumped 7/16 point, or $4.37 for 
every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which falls when its price rises, 
tumbled to 7.88% from 7.92% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.438%, unchanged from late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The downward revision in payroll growth in October cheered bond traders. 
</P>
<P>
Traders have been hoping for evidence of sluggish economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
"The data were viewed as constructive for the bond market," said William 
Sullivan, director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Each new indication of economic weakness improves the chances that the Federal 
Reserve will try to stimulate growth by pushing interest rates lower, analysts 
say. Lower rates tend to boost bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Edges Down; Gold Makes Gains 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended marginally weaker against most key currencies after the 
government released the unemployment report. 
</P>
<P>
Gold rose in domestic trading following a big advance overseas. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery closed 
at $411.80 an ounce, up $1.80 from late Thursday. Republic National Bank in New 
York quoted a late bid for gold at $411.50 an ounce, up $1.90. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the November unemployment data did little to move the 
dollar because it was within market expectations. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
ended at 144.27 Japanese yen, up 0.14 yen from Thursday's close. It traded at 
144.20 yen in London, and 144.300 yen in New York, down from 144.305. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar declined against the British pound. Sterling traded at $1.5793 in 
London, up from $1.5750 Thursday, and at $1.5825 in New York, up from $1.5780. 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Pork Futures Plunge as Export Sales Lag 
</P>
<P>
Pork belly futures prices plunged on the Chicago Board of Trade as concern over 
lagging export sales prompted traders to bail out of the weak market. Livestock 
futures also were lower. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, cotton continued to lose ground, grain and soybeans 
were mixed, precious metals gained and energy futures were mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
Live cattle settled 0.07 to 0.47 cent lower, with the contract for delivery in 
December at 75.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.03 to 0.18 cent lower, 
with January at 82.77 cents a pound; hogs were 0.30 cent to 1.18 cents lower, 
with December at 50.82 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 1.85 to 2 
cents lower, with February at 52.45 cents a pound.

THE ANTI-CIA MURAL IN ECUADOR'S CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re James F. Smith's "The Painter and the Yanquis," Nov. 29: Smith writes, " . . 
. some Americans denounce (artist Oswaldo Guayasamin) as a leftist ingrate 
guilty of perfidious insult to the United States." This is in reference to a 
Nazi helmet with the letters "CIA" emblazoned on it which appears in 
Guayasamin's mural in Ecuador's Congress. 
</P>
<P>
If Americans such as U.S. Ambassador Richard Holwill find Guayasamin's mural 
offensive to the point of demanding that President of Congress Wilfrido Lucero 
climb a ladder in order to paint over the letters, then I suggest that this is 
a typically insidious case of Yanqui arrogance approaching Khomeini-style 
intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than removing the letters from the mural, the nefarious and completely 
un-American institution of the CIA should be totally and permanently removed 
from this hemisphere.

MURPHY MOVIES

Peter Rainer criticizes Eddie Murphy for giving up those great moments on 
"Saturday Night Live" for commercial films that -- according to Rainer -- don't 
measure up to Murphy's talents ("Murphy &amp; Pryor's Star Trek," Nov. 24). How 
come Rainer doesn't criticize other "Saturday Night" graduates such as Chevy 
Chase, who continues to make those innocuous "on the road" movies; or Bill 
Murray, who did "Ghostbusters II," a film that didn't make me laugh once; or 
Dan Aykroyd, who is to the art of acting what apartheid is to compassion. 
</P>
<P>
Of course it has nothing to do with the fact that all these are white and Eddie 
Murphy is black. Of course not!

<P>
Why should Bill Press be required to resign his positions at Channel 7 and KABC 
radio because he is publicly and actively engaged in an exploratory campaign 
for public office? In fact, why should he resign once he officially becomes a 
candidate? Indeed, why should he resign in the happy event he wins the 
election? 
</P>
<P>
I would urge Bill to follow through on his incisive view of civil 
libertarianism by challenging state and federal laws that in any way restrict 
the freedom of speech guaranteed in the Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
I'm confused in one small regard, however. Is Bruce Herschensohn, who handled 
the same issue in the same manner, a civil libertarian like Bill?

 Herschensohn, also a commentator for Channel 7 and KABC-AM, was in a similar 
controversy in the 1986 campaign for the Republican nomination for the U.S. 
Senate. Herschensohn resigned his posts after declaring for the office and then 
returned to the jobs after losing the nomination to Ed Zschau.

THE SHOOTING OF A SHOOT-FROM-THE-HIP MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trail from story conception to the big screen is usually a long and arduous 
one. It took "Batman" nine years to get there. In the case of "The Unsinkable 
Shecky Moskowitz," it took three months. 
</P>
<P>
"Shecky Moskowitz," the story of a cruise-ship waiter who dreams of taking over 
the job of the ship's comic, is a comedy that was filmed almost entirely on 
board a small, weathered cruise ship that sailed in May from New Orleans to 
Cancun, Mexico, with a cargo of 50 beauty queens. The $800,000 film took three 
days to write, a day to cast, two days to prepare and a week of on-board 
shooting plus two days of pick-up shots. 
</P>
<P>
The main character in "Shecky Moskowitz" is a waiter (MTV's Adam Sandler) who 
receives comic instruction from the Guru of Comedy, portrayed in a brief 
uncredited cameo by Milton Berle. The film's cast includes Burt Young ("Rocky") 
as Gen. Noriega, who is intent on assassinating one of the beauties for saying 
that he smells like a pizza ("What kind of a pizza?" one of his aides asks). 
His mistress is portrayed by movie veteran Terry Moore. 
</P>
<P>
"The film has a bizarre thesis," said Young, whose scenes were shot in Los 
Angeles after the cruise. "When they told me how it came about, I had to help 
them. I like young film makers who make things happen. They had no money. When 
I showed up to shoot my scenes at Paramount, we didn't even get into the 
studio. They could only afford to rent the tip of a building outside the studio 
gates." 
</P>
<P>
Theater audiences who want to grab the film by first-time writer-director 
Valerie Breiman will have to get up early in the morning. The Nuart Theater in 
West Los Angeles has agreed to make room for the film, in between its heavy 
schedule of Oscar-qualifying screenings, today and Sunday at 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual film project got started when independent producer Randolf Turrow 
was asked to judge a teen beauty pageant in Palm Springs. As a publicity stunt, 
the pageant promoters were renting a cruise ship and packing it with current 
and former beauty contest winners from across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they didn't have enough guys going on the boat," Turrow said. "So I 
decided to call some of my friends and put together a crew to film this ocean 
quest. The deal was a free cruise, all expenses paid, in the Caribbean." 
</P>
<P>
Before setting sail, Turrow telephoned a friend in Texas, Mark Schultz, who 
agreed to put up the film's production and distribution budget, hoping to cash 
in on his investment in theaters and video rights. 
</P>
<P>
Six days before cast-off, all Turrow needed was a script. He turned to Breiman, 
an actress and aspiring screenwriter who is one of the female leads in his last 
film, "A Tale of Two Sisters." 
</P>
<P>
"The insanity of the whole thing was trying to shoot the whole film in six 
days," said co-producer Adam Rifkin, who plays a sleazy rock star. "The key was 
to kick in the adrenaline and don't even think that it can't be done."

MOODY SOUNDGARDEN GETS A LIFT FROM CORNELL'S VOICE AT WHISKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I see expensive equipment out there," Soundgarden's singer Chris Cornell said 
as he eyed the photographers' gear at the Whisky on Thursday night. "That's 
your sign to thrash." 
</P>
<P>
It was a misleading invitation. The song that followed, like most of the 
Seattle metal-pups' repertoire, moved at a deliberate tempo that dictated a 
less frenzied brand of body language. The crowd responded with a sort of 
slow-motion head-snapping, like repeated swings with a heavy hammer. 
</P>
<P>
Cornell's little trash-the-rich injunction didn't hold much water either, 
because Soundgarden isn't really a rabble-rousing, ideology-heavy operation. So 
why has this low-speed-metal foursome become a leading force in the speed-metal 
scene? Chalk it up to the band's ability to give musical expression to the 
shapeless longing and ache of youth. The mighty throb of discontent makes this 
group a rewarding, if wearying, arrival. 
</P>
<P>
The big revelation at the Whisky was Cornell's voice, which was infinitely more 
striking than on the current "Louder Than Love" album. He worked in the same 
high, clenched range, but he was stronger and more supple, like a cable 
stretched taut over the choppy instrumental sea, then loosening up and twisting 
into winding shapes. 
</P>
<P>
Combined with the processional tempos, the effect was almost liturgical -- a 
ritual of moody and mournful urban boys' blues that they sustained with an 
effort that was both concentrated and casual. 
</P>
<P>
They were loose enough for play -- bassist Jason Everman hit the stage floor 
for a while, and one big rhythmic breakdown brought a smile from bearded 
guitarist Kim Thayil (he looks like a character off a Hindu calendar) as he 
supervised a quick recovery. 
</P>
<P>
While Soundgarden declined to offer high-energy release, its monolithic attack 
did have a purging effect, and Cornell's presence was enough to keep your 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
On the songs where he stood at the mike and played guitar, his hair hung over 
his entire head so that the mike stand looked like a mop standing upside down. 
When his hair parted you saw a pretty, soft-featured face (did someone say Jim 
Morrison?) with a thoughtful, distant expression. 
</P>
<P>
Soundgarden's best hook carries a widely unprintable lyric and is a crusher 
that Living Colour might envy. But the band also revealed roots beyond the 
obvious metal templates, offering a version of the Beatles' "Come Together" 
made queasy by a dissonant, droning riff, and stitching the Guess Who's 
contemptuous "American Woman" into their own ecology/imperialism lament "Hands 
All Over." 
</P>
<P>
If the world doesn't destroy itself, Soundgarden will return to the Whisky 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
LENNON TRIBUTE: A series of John Lennon tribute events are being planned for 
Milwaukee this spring. Sid Bernstein, who promoted Beatles' concerts at 
Carnegie Hall and Shea Stadium, said details will be announced Monday at a 
Universal City press conference that will be attended by Julian Lennon and his 
mother, Cynthia, as well as by Paula Abdul and Rudolf Nureyev. 
</P>
<P>
None of the surviving ex-Beatles, nor Lennon's second wife Yoko Ono, is 
expected to participate, though Bernstein said that Beatles producer George 
Martin has agreed to conduct an orchestra performing Lennon's music. Plans call 
for the events to be taped and televised at a later date on a pay-per-view 
basis to benefit several charitable organizations. 
</P>
<P>
LIVE ACTION: Tickets go on sale today for Motley Crue at the Forum, Feb. 12.

'AGAINST THE MOB' LONG ON '40S CHIC, SHORT ON ALL ELSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We have a great affection for the '40s. Life was simpler, or so it seemed. Men 
wore hats and smoked, women had bulky hair and you could tell all the cars 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
Well, simpler isn't always better. For example, "Man Against the Mob: The 
Chinatown Murders," airing Sunday night at 9 on Channels 4, 36 and 39, with 
George Peppard returning in a second rendition of L.A. mob cop Frank Doakey 
circa 1945. 
</P>
<P>
You know the simple plot from early in the opening act. Ex-pug Buddy (acted 
with extra enthusiasm by Charles Haid) witnesses the murder of a small-time 
Chinese mug. It looks like new muscle is trying to take over the Chinatown 
rackets, and of course it's cops on the take. 
</P>
<P>
Doakey is a rough, tough detective of the old rough, tough school, and he and a 
small band of investigators -- just enough to make a TV series -- walk through 
the pedestrian script without much difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
Peppard looks good in a hat and is properly wiseacre. He doesn't appear to 
extend himself much, which is the problem for the whole adventure. Everybody 
stands around looking '40s. 
</P>
<P>
The ambience is great. The cars are fabulous and whenever there is some action, 
they never damage the cars. They only shoot out the windows. Whew. -- I. L. IRV

'MONEY, POWER, MURDER' JUST CAN'T CARRY THE PLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRV LETOFSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The made-for-TV movie "Money, Power, Murder" promises in its title almost 
everything in the ratings sun except sex and rich chocolate treats. 
</P>
<P>
This CBS endeavor (9 p.m. Sunday on Channels 2 and 8) stars Kevin Dobson as 
smart but wise-aleck, clever but unorthodox, tough but heart-o'-gold reporter 
Peter Finley, who works for a small but feisty New York cable news operation. A 
good, breezy character. 
</P>
<P>
He sets about covering the disappearance of hot-eyed and hot-rated (but hotly 
despised) network anchorwoman Peggy Ann Brady (Julianne Moore). Then a lot of 
people start showing up dead. 
</P>
<P>
There's some money, power and murder here, and a little sex, too, between Peter 
and his ex-wife (Blythe Danner). 
</P>
<P>
As written by New York Daily News sportswriter Mike Lupica from his book of the 
same name, the script gives Dobson a lot more snappy patter than is needed. 
Likewise, he gives us more incredible plot than is needed and it stumbles over 
itself before falling down of its own weight. 
</P>
<P>
It proves that money, power and murder aren't enough anymore. IRV LETOFSKY

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: DATING TEENS OFTEN MIMIC STEREOTYPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My 16-year-old daughter, who is often a terror and always 
totally assertive at home, turned into the most passive, old-fashioned girl 
when she went on her first date. I observed this because she and her young 
boyfriend shared coffee and dessert with my husband and me before they went to 
see the film they'd selected. Both my husband and I were a bit disappointed 
because neither of us admire the passive, submissive female. What happened to 
our little feminist? -- S.B. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR S.B.: Don't be too alarmed. If your daughter has been raised to be 
independent and assertive, I doubt that she'll permanently switch roles and 
become a quiet, clinging vine. Like most youngsters on a first date, she's 
insecure and afraid of offending her partner. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Jerrold Lee Shapiro, an associate professor of psychology at 
the University of Santa Clara in California, youngsters often fall back on 
stereotypes on a first date. For girls, that means taking a passive role about 
initiating the date and deciding how they spend the time, and for boys, the 
script is the opposite, even though it may not feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
He attributes the stereotypical behavior to teen-agers' acute need to be 
accepted by peers. Youngsters are deeply concerned about how their peers see 
them and they want to be like everyone else. God forbid, they should appear to 
be different in any way. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Recently, my wife and I inherited enough money to do a major 
remodeling job on our home. This is something we've wanted to do for years, so 
it amazes me that ever since we started we've done nothing but quarrel. Twice, 
I've walked out of the place and at one time we considered divorce. What is 
this? We were a happily married couple for 15 years. -- M.K. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR M.K.: You're not the only couple to find the whole process of remodeling 
stressful. Humans are creatures of habit and when their surroundings are in a 
state of disarray, especially if they feel they're being taken advantage of and 
they can see their money doing down the drain, stress is created that can make 
the best of marriages erupt in turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Many architects use the parallel of pregnancy and birth to describe the anxiety 
and trauma the couples experience during this trying time. The good news is 
once it's over, couples usually begin to lick their wounds, heal and start 
enjoying the rewards of all the months of doubt. 
</P>
<P>
People invest a great deal of themselves in their houses and what is done to 
them. The choices that are made can become a kind of personal statement, where 
each spouse feels his taste is on the line. 
</P>
<P>
You can help yourselves if you try to keep the remodeling in perspective. Admit 
error and try not to blame each other when something goes wrong.

CZECHS BREAK THE COMMUNIST HOLD, NEAR A COALITION; 
</P>
<P>
EAST BLOC: THE OPPOSITION WILL PREDOMINATE IN A NEW GOVERNMENT. OLD GUARD 
PRESIDENT'S RESIGNATION EXPECTED.

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation of Czechoslovakia stood on the verge of its first non-Communist 
government in more than 40 years Friday as intense negotiations finally broke 
the party's efforts to retain power. 
</P>
<P>
"A new coalition will be formed," declared Communist Politburo member Vasil 
Mohorita, who represented his party at the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Echoed Vaclav Klaus, a negotiator from the opposition group Civic Forum: "We 
agreed on almost everything. You'll hear extraordinary things." 
</P>
<P>
Both men spoke as they emerged from nearly six hours of round-table 
negotiations that brought the Communists and Civic Forum together for the first 
time with members of other political parties and other national organizations, 
including the trade union movement. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the meeting also indicated that President Gustav Husak, the 
last Old Guard Communist remaining in a senior position, is expected to step 
down by the end of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent agreement came only one day after Communist Prime Minister 
Ladislav Adamec suddenly gave up attempts to form a government and resigned. 
</P>
<P>
While no list of the new government was released, participants in the 
negotiations said that the new prime minister-designate, Marian Calfa, a 
Communist, would head the new government but that the Communists would be in a 
slight minority. 
</P>
<P>
It was also apparent that human rights activist and lawyer Jan Carnogursky, who 
was in jail two weeks ago, will be a member of the new Czechoslovak Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
A brief announcement by the Czechoslovak news agency CTK said that 
"considerable agreement had been reached" and that the new government will be 
sworn in Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement would end an attempt that began 10 days ago to build an interim 
coalition government that sometime next year would shepherd Czechoslovakia to 
its first free national elections since 1946. 
</P>
<P>
One of those in the talks indicated that a deal may have been struck for the 
resignation of Husak, the man who replaced Alexander Dubcek as Communist Party 
leader after the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia ended the reforms 
of the so-called Prague Spring. 
</P>
<P>
His fall would remove from high office the final Communist figure linked with 
the 1968 invasion. 
</P>
<P>
According to Josef Bartonicek, head of the small People's Party, Husak was 
expected to give the necessary constitutional approval to the new government 
and then step down. 
</P>
<P>
Mohorita said the Communists plan to issue a statement today pertaining to 
Husak's future. 
</P>
<P>
Husak, who is 76 and in poor health, was demoted from the Communist Party's 
ruling Politburo two weeks ago but has remained as president despite opposition 
demands for his departure. 
</P>
<P>
His resignation would fulfill one of the last of Civic Forum's principal 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
Participants said the talks will resume today, but indicated strongly that 
agreement had already been reached on all major points. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if the new Cabinet is complete, Mohorita said, "nearly." 
</P>
<P>
Others said that for some posts, Calfa had been given more than one choice by 
the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum negotiators, who included the opposition's leading figure, 
playwright Vaclav Havel, emerged from Friday's talks in obvious good spirits 
and a Western television crew said Havel flashed a brief thumbs up as he 
departed. 
</P>
<P>
While the absence of a complete list of the Cabinet left unclear whether Civic 
Forum had managed to negotiate places for all of its proposed candidates, 
Friday's formula would appear to constitute a considerable victory for the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
In the 19 days since it was born, Civic Forum has brought down Czechoslovakia's 
repressive Communist hierarchy, erased the party's leading role from the 
constitution, pushed the Communists into a minority role in the government and 
set the country on its way to free elections. 
</P>
<P>
Calfa was asked to form a government Thursday after Adamec resigned. 
</P>
<P>
If Calfa, 43, is named prime minister as expected, he would be one of the least 
experienced heads of government the country has ever had. 
</P>
<P>
He went straight from law school to the prime ministry's legal department, 
where he worked for 15 years in relative obscurity before being promoted to 
deputy head of the department in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He was elevated to the Cabinet 20 months ago as a minister without portfolio, 
heading a legislative drafting committee within the government. 
</P>
<P>
The first hints of a possible agreement came earlier in the day when the 
Communists said they were prepared to accept a minority role in the government. 
</P>
<P>
Their willingness to agree to a formula where 50% of the Cabinet is composed of 
experts with no party affiliation and the remaining 50% is divided among 
several entities, including the Communists, was the latest in a lengthening 
series of retreats the party has been forced to make since it began losing its 
grip on power two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum said Thursday that it was prepared to work with Calfa on the 
precondition that Carnogursky be named first deputy prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
All indications are that this deal was struck. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have anything against Mr. Carnogursky," said People's Party leader 
Bartonicek. 
</P>
<P>
Carnogursky is one of Czechoslovakia's most prominent dissidents. A signer of 
the Charter 77 human rights appeal, which marked the birth of the current 
opposition movement, he is well known as a lawyer and church activist. 
</P>
<P>
He hails from Slovakia and published the underground newspaper in that 
republic's main city of Bratislava. 
</P>
<P>
Like many dissidents, he was denied the right to practice his profession after 
signing the Charter 77 petition. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested last Aug. 17 along with Miroslav Kusy, another member of Civic 
Forum's negotiating team at the current talks, and charged with sedition in 
connection with public declarations that he intended to lay flowers on the 
graves of victims of the 1968 Soviet-led invasion. 
</P>
<P>
He defended himself in court and was finally released Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Mohorita described Friday's talks as "pleasant," and an aide to Havel said that 
a picture of V. I. Lenin, the father of Soviet communism, was removed from the 
wall prior to the start of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's breakthrough came on a day that Husak declared an amnesty for persons 
convicted for a broad range of crimes, including charges linked to political 
offenses and petty harassment. 
</P>
<P>
The release of all political prisoners has been a major Civic Forum demand, and 
many have been set free in the past two weeks. It was unclear how many were 
affected by Friday's announcement.

STATE SURVEY SHOWS COUNTY ASBESTOS THREAT; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC HEALTH: A HEALTH DEPARTMENT REPORT STATES THAT ASBESTOS SHOULD BE 
REMOVED IMMEDIATELY FROM HALF OF THE PUBLIC BUILDINGS INSPECTED IN SAN DIEGO 
COUNTY. SAN DIEGO OFFICIALS MAINTAIN, HOWEVER, THAT THE PUBLIC AND CITY 
EMPLOYEES FACE NO RISK.

<P>
Half of the public buildings in San Diego County inspected last year in a state 
health department survey contained health-threatening asbestos that should be 
removed immediately, according to reports released Friday to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Worst among the San Diego sampling was the San Diego Civic Theatre on C Street, 
where the survey found 100,000 square feet of spray-applied fireproofing 
requiring emergency removal from the building's structural supports and 
mechanical room. The estimated cost of removal is $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, who conducted a top-to-bottom check of 158 municipal buildings 
after receiving the report, said air samples show that the public and city 
employees face no danger from asbestos in any of the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"I can say there is no health hazard in any public building in the city of San 
Diego," said Alan Johanns, the city's asbestos program coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Air samples taken in 19 places in the Civic Theatre, for example, showed no 
airborne asbestos fibers in most locations and nothing approaching limits set 
by the state Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Johanns said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the city has padlocked a mechanical room where 
asbestos-containing debris has become exposed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also receiving poor marks was the downtown library, where the survey called for 
emergency removal of asbestos-laden insulation from throughout the building, 
including sound booths. 
</P>
<P>
"This insulation is friable (crumbles easily) and ranges from good to fair," 
says the report on the library, which notes that debris exists in some areas. 
"This poses a significant hazard since airborne asbestos fibers can be 
generated." 
</P>
<P>
In all, the survey, performed under contract to the Department of Health 
Services by Diagnostic Engineering of Arcadia, found asbestos that needed to be 
taken out immediately from 11 of the 22 buildings throughout the county that 
were inspected. The list includes areas of San Diego City Hall, the county 
social service offices in Escondido and El Cajon, and the Marston House Museum 
on the edge of Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
The 22 San Diego County buildings were part of a statewide inspection of 250 
public structures -- such as hospitals, airports, libraries, courthouses and 
police stations -- conducted last year by the Department of Health Services and 
other state agencies to estimate the extent of the asbestos problem in 
government-owned facilities throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
Survey results have yet to be officially released and are contained in a report 
awaiting Gov. George Deukmejian's signature, although it has been forwarded to 
his office for several months. 
</P>
<P>
However, The Times obtained a copy of the report and reported in September that 
the entire sample shows a massive amount of asbestos that may cost taxpayers as 
much as $660 million to remove or stabilize. It also reported that the state 
agencies recommended removing the asbestos within one year from 42% of the 
buildings sampled. 
</P>
<P>
How those figures broke down for the San Diego County buildings is shown in the 
original reports prepared by Diagnostic Engineering Inc. Copies of the reports 
detailing the findings were sent to each of the local government agencies in 
September, 1988, but were not released as a group by the state until Friday at 
The Times' request. 
</P>
<P>
The original survey reports show that San Diego County's public buildings fared 
slightly worse than their counterparts throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 22 surveyed, only one -- the San Diego County garage -- was found to be 
asbestos-free. All the rest had some form of asbestos in ceiling tile and pipe 
insulation, many times in rooms outside public areas that are used only by 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the 22 buildings required immediate attention, Diagnostic Engineering 
determined; the rest would require removal in time frames ranging from six 
months to several years, the reports show. 
</P>
<P>
Preston Porter, project manager for Diagnostic Engineering, said Friday that a 
recommendation for immediate removal indicates, in his firm's opinion, that 
"the conditions probably present some health risk," and the asbestos should be 
eliminated within a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Asbestos itself presents a health risk," Porter said. "In terms of the risk in 
a particular building, it depends on the type of material and its condition and 
so forth, whether people can come in contact with the material and whether it 
has the potential to release fibers. There isn't a blanket, easy definition 
that covers every facility." 
</P>
<P>
At the Civic Theatre, the company found spray-applied fireproofing on the 
structural support system and in the mechanical room; the consultant noted the 
presence of asbestos debris. 
</P>
<P>
"Caution should be taken by all maintenance personnel who seem to use these 
(areas) for repair work," said the report. "Label warning should be posted to 
all areas where the presence of this material may be confronted. Also, pipe 
insulation debris has been noted as mentioned above. 
</P>
<P>
"These both pose a significant health risk since airborne asbestos fibers may 
be generated by natural air movements," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego has hired consultants to prepare plans for removing or 
capping asbestos in all 158 buildings surveyed, Johanns said. The cost of that 
effort should be known in the next few months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
County officials could not be reached for comment Friday. In La Mesa, asbestos 
in the only building surveyed had been capped before Diagnostic Engineering's 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
"All city-owned public buildings were inspected (in the early 1980s) and, if 
there was any found, it was dealt with," said Cecil Leonardo, director of 
public works for the city of La Mesa. "So now we have asbestos-free public 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Given the results of air samples, Johanns questioned the designation of the 
Civic Theatre's asbestos problem as an "emergency." 
</P>
<P>
"In general, I felt that there are a lot of areas here where they are stating 
an emergency removal (is needed), and it's not correct," Johanns said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Civic Theatre and library, problems highlighted by the reports 
include: 
</P>
<P>
* The boiler mechanical room in San Diego City Hall. "This insulation is very 
friable and damaged with debris present. This poses a significant health 
hazard," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
* The Marston House, which was found to have easily crumbled asbestos 
throughout, especially around air ducts leading into the closets. The survey 
called for emergency and immediate removal of the substance from the attic and 
closets.

FULL VERDICT IN HUNTER CASE IS QUESTIONABLE; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: THREE JURORS DOUBT THE GROUP CAN REACH A A FULL VERDICT ON 197 COUNTS 
AGAINST NANCY HOOVER HUNTER. THE JUDGE GAVE THE GROUP THE AFTERNOON OFF, BUT 
ORDERED THEM BACK TO DELIBERATIONS ON MONDAY.

<P>
Jurors in Nancy Hoover Hunter's federal tax evasion and fraud trial indicated 
Friday that they had reached partial verdicts but were "unable to render a 
complete verdict in the case." 
</P>
<P>
At a late-morning hearing, three of the 12 jurors told U. S. Judge Earl B. 
Gilliam they did not feel the panel could reach a full verdict on the 197 
counts against Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
But, because nine jurors indicated there was at least a chance that a complete 
verdict can be reached, Gilliam ordered the panel to return Monday morning for 
further deliberations -- though he gave them all of Friday afternoon off. 
</P>
<P>
In a "situation of debate," Gilliam said, "sometimes a mind will become clearer 
after a rest period." 
</P>
<P>
The judge did not ask the panel to reveal what verdicts it had reached. 
</P>
<P>
The charges against Hunter stem from her role as a top executive in the La 
Jolla investment firm J. David &amp; Co. from 1979 to 1984, when its checks 
began to bounce and nervous investors forced the firm into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
In all, investors lost about $80 million in the J. David affair, a giant Ponzi 
scheme in which prosecutors allege that Hunter played an active role. Hunter's 
defense lawyers have contended throughout the eight-month trial that she was 
blinded by her love for the founder of the firm, J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, 
and was unaware of any illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
Dominelli pleaded guilty in 1985 to four counts of fraud and tax evasion in 
connection with the investment firm's Ponzi scheme and is serving a 20-year 
sentence in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors in Hunter's case had embarked Friday morning upon their 14th day of 
deliberations when they sent Gilliam a note saying they had reached partial 
verdicts but saw no chance of reaching a full verdict. The judge sent them back 
for more talks, but they sent him another note an hour or so later saying they 
remained "unable" to decide more. 
</P>
<P>
In open court, before a crowd of spectators and reporters that spilled out of 
the courtroom and into the hall, Gilliam then asked each of the 12 whether a 
complete verdict was possible. 
</P>
<P>
Three said no. One of the three, Dorothy Andre, 62, of San Diego, said, "I 
don't think we'll ever come to any kind of decision. Not this jury." 
</P>
<P>
Andre was the juror who last week wrote Gilliam a note asking to be replaced by 
one of the two alternate jurors, saying she never realized that "having to 
decide someone's fate" could cause her "such worry, anxiety and concern." The 
judge did not, however, order her off the panel. 
</P>
<P>
The nine jurors who told Gilliam on Friday that they thought the panel might be 
able to reach a verdict appeared unconvinced that the group actually would 
reach unanimous agreement. "I feel it remains remote," said foreman Russell S. 
Litchfield, 66, of El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
The Hunter case is believed to be the longest-running criminal trial in the 
history of the San Diego federal court. The trial began March 28.

EX-HUSBAND TO BE TRIED IN KILLING OF LOTTERY WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The killing of Anne Jenkins in February, 1988, three weeks after she and her 
husband won $727,000 in the California Lottery, seemed to be an unsolvable 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide investigators couldn't find a single shred of forensic evidence at the 
30-year-old woman's San Marcos home. There were no fingerprints, no fibers, no 
hairs, no murder weapon -- nothing. 
</P>
<P>
But what investigators found later were several books detailing how to commit 
the perfect murder, including chapters on how to foil the crime lab. 
</P>
<P>
The books were in the possession of Jenkins' ex-husband, David Scott Harrison. 
The two had been entangled in an acrimonious, eight-year custody battle over 
the couple's two children. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Harrison, 32, was ordered to stand trial in Vista Superior Court on 
charges that he murdered Jenkins by slashing her throat. 
</P>
<P>
"It's ironic that the same books he used to perfect the technique of this 
murder turned out to be his undoing," said Larry Burns, an assistant U. S. 
attorney who handled the preliminary examination of Harrison on behalf of the 
district attorney's office because he had previously prosecuted Harrison on 
federal bomb charges. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the most interesting criminal case I've ever handled," Burns 
said. "All the evidence against Harrison is circumstantial. There's no direct 
evidence linking the defendant to the house. But we have strong motive, 
preparation and opportunity on his part." 
</P>
<P>
The motive, Burns alleged, was Harrison's concern that his ex-wife, with her 
new-found wealth, could better finance the legal battle over the visitation and 
financial support of the couple's children, who were in her custody. 
Previously, Jenkins had been financially drained by the legal costs, while 
Harrison had relied on his family's wealth to pay for his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The preparation, Burns said, came by reading books on murder and through the 
incessant harassment of Jenkins, her new husband, Gary Jenkins, and her father. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison's attorney, Alan May, argued during the preliminary hearing before 
Vista Municipal Judge Suzanne Knauf that police did not adequately investigate 
the crime and that there are other suspects, including Gary Jenkins himself. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, who is already serving a 20-year federal prison term, will be 
arraigned Jan. 2 in Vista Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
He took the stand in his own defense Thursday, admitting that he had changed 
the Jenkinses' telephone number, ordered unwanted magazine subscriptions for 
the couple and submitted false change-of-address forms for both the Jenkinses' 
home and her father's home and business. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison had also talked to others about throat slashings, according to 
testimony, and Burns submitted a picture in court showing Harrison's male lover 
pretending to slash Harrison's own throat -- a reenactment complete with 
ketchup. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison had been convicted in federal court for the bombing of Gary Jenkins' 
ex-wife's vehicle in Vista -- an unsuccessful attempt, Burns said, to cast 
suspicion on Gary Jenkins as a violent person. 
</P>
<P>
During the preliminary hearing, Gary Jenkins testified that Harrison had 
threatened to throw a pipe bomb through the children's bedroom window in San 
Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
There is no direct evidence putting Harrison at the scene of the killing, but a 
neighbor testified that he saw Anne Jenkins arguing with a man in front of her 
house the day she was killed and overheard words about child custody and court 
battle. The neighbor quoted the woman as telling the man: "We have money now. 
We can fight you." 
</P>
<P>
Burns alleged that, although Harrison had tried to establish several alibis for 
himself the day of the killing, there was opportunity for him to leave his 
Solana Beach home and a two-hour unexplained gap in his otherwise documented 
activities at the time at which the coroner's office said Jenkins was killed. 
</P>
<P>
A former jail cellmate testified that Harrison had talked about the murder, 
telling him, "I promise you, she suffered."

Approval of the Lower Arroyo Master Plan this week means that $450,000 can be 
used within the next two years to clean and improve nature trails, replant 
native vegetation and remove parking lots along the 1.7-mile-long park that 
follows the riverbed beneath the Colorado Street Bridge.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH PLAN FOR AUTO MALL SUFFERS 
SETBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long Beach's attempts to keep its auto dealers from fleeing to other cities hit 
a major setback this week when neighboring Signal Hill signed exclusive 
negotiating agreements with four Long Beach dealers who have decided they would 
rather do business in Signal Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Both cities are planning auto malls. But while Long Beach has yet to sign up a 
dealer, Signal Hill already has signed up two Long Beach dealerships and will 
begin finalizing agreements with the four. Signal Hill was able to offer the 
dealers a better financial arrangement and an earlier construction date than 
Long Beach, which started planning its mall after Signal Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Shick, Long Beach community development director, said the city will 
continue to pursue other dealers and perhaps rethink the mall proposal to 
include retail space.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. ADOPTS LENINGRAD AS ITS 16TH 'SISTER 
CITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council adopted Leningrad as Los Angeles' newest "Sister City" Friday, 
but in light of continued complaints of human rights abuses in that Soviet 
city, the formal resolution was amended with a call for political reform. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joel Wachs, who proposed the link between the two cities, said he 
hoped the new relationship would "extend the cause of peace, freedom and 
understanding between the people of the Soviet Union and the people of this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles has 15 other such agreements with cities throughout the world, but 
the relationship with Leningrad is the first between Los Angeles and a Soviet 
city. Both cities are the second largest in their respective countries.

WEST HOLLYWOOD CARD CLUB PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owners of a small, private bridge and rummy club in West Hollywood are 
seeking city permission to turn the club into a glittering approximation of a 
Las Vegas casino, offering public gambling on all legal card games. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the Cavendish West Hollywood Club on Sunset Boulevard, 
where the city borders Beverly Hills, would double in size and become the first 
legal casino on the Westside. It would be similar in concept and only slightly 
smaller than the large Eastside card clubs in Bell and Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The partners behind the Cavendish Club have quietly lobbied West Hollywood city 
officials and community groups for several months about the expansion. The City 
Council will hold a public hearing on the plan Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The club currently occupies a mezzanine floor of a high-rise office building. 
If the expansion is approved, it would occupy an additional floor, turning the 
dowdy 30-table bridge and rummy club into a casino with 70 tables, valet 
parking, an atrium and an expensive restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The club's general partner, Philip Marks, said plans for the new club have been 
drafted to reflect the affluent image of the Westside, and he insisted that it 
would have none of the crime and corruption problems that have plagued some 
other area clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something the people of West Hollywood will be proud of," said Marks, 
who operates legal gaming aboard two cruise ships and is chairman of the board 
of Kettering Industries Inc., a New Jersey manufacturer of toys and promotional 
items. "We want to help them improve their image. The whole nature of the 
operation is extremely upscale." 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood City Council members -- three of whom openly scoffed at the idea 
of allowing legalized gambling in the city during elections three years ago -- 
are skeptical of the plan but say they are willing to hear the Cavendish 
partners out. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure I would give odds on approval," City Councilman Paul Koretz said. 
"But it would supply a very substantial amount of money to the city, whereby 
the city could add additional (Sheriff's Department) patrol people and actually 
reduce crime." 
</P>
<P>
In recent individual meetings with each City Council member, Jerry Gould, the 
Cavendish Club manager and a limited partner in the business, and lobbyist 
Bruce Decker have contended that the city could receive more than $6 million a 
year in fees from the operation after the first year, which is equal to about 
20% of the city's operating budget. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the would-be developers have already established a charitable 
foundation that would channel 2% of the club's annual gross toward human 
services, and they have lobbied more than 20 health and social service groups 
seeking support. 
</P>
<P>
Under California gambling laws, cities and counties have the option of allowing 
clubs where patrons may play for money against each other in a variety of 
"games of skill," a category that has been interpreted to include card games 
such as poker, rummy and pan. 
</P>
<P>
Games of chance, including most of the popular forms of Las Vegas gambling -- 
slot machines, craps, blackjack and roulette, for example -- are not permitted. 
</P>
<P>
While casino gamblers in Nevada and Atlantic City play against each other and 
against the house, in California they play only against each other. There is no 
house; the clubs act only as a host, providing tables and a dealer. 
</P>
<P>
The clubs make money by renting seats to players, with higher seat rent for 
tables playing for bigger stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Gould said if approved, the club would charge between $8 and $40 an hour for 
rental on more than 500 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Although some Los Angeles-area card clubs, such as those in Gardena, have been 
operating for more than 40 years, most of the clubs have been approved since 
the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Governments in cities such as Bell and Commerce, which were hard hit by the 
tax-cutting initiative, turned to the legal casinos, with their promise of huge 
revenues, to balance their books. The casinos also offered hundreds of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
To obtain local government approval, casino operators promised large cuts of 
their gross revenues, sometimes as high as 13%, which instantly resulted in 
millions of dollars for municipal treasuries. 
</P>
<P>
But as more of the clubs opened, the mostly blue-collar and Asian clientele was 
spread more thinly, and profits began to fall. Cities that had grown dependent 
on the gambling revenues to pay for services suddenly found their jackpots 
drying up. 
</P>
<P>
Charges of widespread cheating and corruption also followed the card club boom 
in the early 1980s. A Times investigation in 1982, for example, found extensive 
evidence of organized cheating, loan-sharking and other illicit activities at 
several clubs in Bell and Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, fierce competition between clubs resulted in a number of scandals 
involving some club owners and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
In the early and mid-1980s, 14 people in Bell and Commerce, including three 
city councilmen and a former mayor, were convicted or pleaded guilty to charges 
of bribery, illegal gambling and racketeering that grew out of an investigation 
of activities at the two cities' card clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those difficulties, many card club proponents saw the legalization of 
the state lottery three years ago as a sign that public opinion toward gambling 
was changing, and card club proposals began to surface again. 
</P>
<P>
But under a 1984 state law, ordinances allowing gambling in cities must be 
approved by voters. Voters in Cathedral City, near Palm Springs, and Stanton in 
Orange County have recently rejected proposals to allow card playing for money. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavendish backers say that if the City Council refuses to put the proposed 
expansion before the city's voters, they will consider a petition drive of 
their own to force a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Marks and his allies say they believe that the club's location will help them 
draw an affluent crowd of players from the Westside and the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking for those same creative people and entertainment folk that go 
to Nicky Blair's (restaurant) and the L'Hermitage Hotel," Marks said. 
</P>
<P>
Operators of some Eastside clubs say they are concerned about losing business. 
George Hardie, operator of the Bicycle Club in Bell Gardens, estimated that up 
to 30% of his business is from Westside patrons. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Kopel, executive director of the California Card Club Owners Assn., agreed 
that the Cavendish Club's location would make it a strong competitor for 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"If they pull it off, a major card room would be a real coup for the partners. 
A card club in that area that might draw in people from the San Fernando Valley 
would be a gold mine," Kopel said. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood residents and neighbors of the club, many of whom have learned 
of the Cavendish expansion plans only in the last few days, are trying to 
quickly organize opposition to the expansion.

FLAG PLEDGE SNUB BY 3 ON RENT BOARD SPARKS FUROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The American flag, often the center of controversy in national and foreign 
issues, has been unfurled in the contentious relationship between the Santa 
Monica Rent Control Board and area landlords. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, three of the five elected board members, whose political 
pronouncements often go beyond rental and housing issues, announced that they 
would refrain from pledging allegiance to the flag at the beginning of board 
meetings in protest of U.S. involvement in El Salvador. The three had said that 
they would instead observe a moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday night's board meeting at City Hall, more than 100 landlords and war 
veterans protested by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance twice, singing "God 
Bless America," and calling for the resignation of the three board members. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a nice party," said Carl Lambert, president of Action, the largest 
landlords' group in Santa Monica, and an organizer of the demonstration. Action 
members at a meeting Monday informally decided to demonstrate at Thursday's 
meeting and then contacted other landlords and veterans groups. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely an interesting meeting," said Wayne Bauer, one of the 
protesting board members. 
</P>
<P>
A flyer distributed before the meeting said: "Either these publicly elected 
officials should, here and now, recite our country's Pledge of Allegiance . . . 
or they should resign. Either these elected Santa Monica officials should 
support America's constitutional rights, America's free enterprise system and 
ideals, and America's national symbol or they should resign from public office 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
Lambert called the board members' refusal to salute the flag "indicative of the 
fact that they continue to have no respect for the Constitution or justice or 
fairness. They do whatever they want." 
</P>
<P>
Protesters waved small flags and carried candles outside the meeting room, 
before marching into the session. Lambert said similar demonstrations will be 
held at every board meeting until the board members resume recognizing the 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that the issue is not free speech or El Salvador," said landlord 
James Baker. "The issue is elected officials conducting a publicly funded 
meeting and holding the flag hostage to their political views. To refuse to 
lead the pledge is irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
Board chairwoman Susan Packer Davis, one of the protesting three, said she had 
no objection to anyone else reciting the Pledge of Allegiance at the meetings 
and that being an elected official does not mean giving up rights to free 
speech. She called the demonstration part of a tendency to focus on the flag 
rather than on the polices and rights represented by the flag. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a right to protest, but they can't enforce their wishes on me," 
Davis said. "This is not a board action, this is a personal action. It's not 
like this is occupying all our time at board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"They see this as un-American because we don't support the same kind of free 
enterprise rights as they do. But we're trying to preserve housing. They are 
using the flag to once again attack rent control." 
</P>
<P>
The flag is "just a piece of cloth without the rights attached it it," Bauer 
said. "People should take the flag from in front of their eyes and look around 
and see how taxpayers' money is being spent." 
</P>
<P>
Julie Lopez Dad, the third board member choosing the silent protest, said the 
decision for her was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"It has always been important to me to pledge the flag, but I am doing this . . 
. because what is going on in El Salvador is so serious." Dad said. "But the 
demonstration did not have as much to do with the flag as it did (with) 
anti-rent control sentiment. The flag was misused and abused by those who used 
it to pour out their vengeance and hate against rent control." 
</P>
<P>
Board member Dolores Press said she agrees with her colleagues' opposition to 
U.S. involvement in El Salvador but chooses not to use the board meetings as a 
"forum for my anger." Press said she will continue to recite the Pledge of 
Allegiance at board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
However, she questioned whether the landlords' demonstration was really about 
patriotism, but rather just another attack on rent control.

POLICE PROBE GAMBLING LINK IN ROBBERY, MURDER NEAR CASINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huntington Park police were trying to determine whether gambling or drinking or 
both contributed to the murder of a 35-year-old Inglewood man who was fatally 
beaten with a tire iron or crowbar only a few hundred feet from the Huntington 
Park Casino. 
</P>
<P>
An undetermined amount of money was taken from the victim, Ricardo Salinas. 
Police booked one man for investigation of murder but were withholding his name 
because they were seeking to arrest others. 
</P>
<P>
The killing was preceded by a disturbance outside the casino, which also has a 
bar. Police said the victim may have been killed for casino winnings "or as a 
result of a gang thing." 
</P>
<P>
However, a casino employee who would identify himself only as "Tom" said the 
victim "was among a group of guys drinking at the bar -- they're drinkers, not 
players. They got into a big fight in the bar, and we threw them out and turned 
them over to the cops. But I guess they must have let them go because it was 
mutual combat, and then this guy gets attacked a few hundred feet down the 
street."

AN EXCHANGE OF LETTERS ON ABORTION 
</P>
<P>
* William Sloane Coffin and Thomas J. Gumbleton are both active in disarmament 
and social justice organizations and are friends. But they disagree, as do 
their respective organizations, on the right to abortion. In these public 
letters they discuss their views. Coffin, a United Church of Christ clergyman, 
is president of Sane/Freeze Campaign for Global Security, based in Washington. 
Gumbleton, a Roman Catholic bishop in Detroit, is president of Pax Christi 
U.S.A., the National Catholic Peace Movement, based in Erie, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dear Tom, 
</P>
<P>
Our two organizations have long collaborated closely even as you and I have 
personally. Our members see eye-to-eye on the urgent need for disarmament, 
greater economic justice and a life style more considerate of the environment. 
However, on abortion they disagree. 
</P>
<P>
I worry about this threat to our warm relations. It is a continuing one, for 
abortion will be hotly debated in legislative and electoral battles across the 
land for some time to come. 
</P>
<P>
So, not as a peace organization president but as friend to friend I'm writing 
in the hope that you and I might find language in common to help people think 
more clearly, and that we might even reach agreement on the government's proper 
role in this matter. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding abortion, the crucial question for many religious people is, "At what 
point, if at any, can unborn life be called human?" Complicating the answer is 
the fact that science can't provide it. Science can tell us when a heart starts 
beating, as it can when a brain has stopped functioning. But science cannot 
tell us when it is morally right to cease all artificial supports for a dying 
person, because science is not in a position to declare, "This is no longer a 
human being." It is the business of science to provide the facts of natural 
life, not the values of human life. In other words, when human life ends and 
when human life begins are moral judgments, not medical ones. So far, I think 
we are in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
It goes without saying that a fertilized egg in a woman's uterus is human in 
origin and human in destiny. But is that enough to warrant calling a fertilized 
egg -- as did a recent Missouri law -- a human being with "all the rights, 
privileges and immunities available to persons, citizens, and residents of this 
state?" Doesn't the traditional Roman Catholic developmental view of life make 
as much sense as the recent one that seeks to erase all distinctions between 
potential life and actual life? And, in fact, don't we all act as if there were 
a difference between potential and actual life. When a fetus aborts 
spontaneously, we grieve for the parents, hardly at all for the life no one has 
seen. We don't have funerals for unborn children. No one urges the same 
punishment for a mother who aborts a fetus as for one who murders her child. 
And no one, to my knowledge, has applied for Social Security nine months before 
his or her 62nd birthday! 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of agreement on when human life begins, we have to agree to 
disagree -- but hopefully with more clarity than is usual, and in a less 
judgmental fashion, so that disagreements don't shade off into distrust. 
</P>
<P>
I also hope that there might be greater consensus among us when we consider the 
advisability of criminalizing abortion. To call a crime something a great many 
people don't even consider a sin is, to say the least, problematic. As a canon 
lawyer, you know that one of the criteria for a good law is its enforceability; 
that is why precisely, after they proved unenforceable, that the Prohibition 
laws of the 1920s were finally repealed in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
Today a large number of Roman Catholics feel, as do many of the rest of us, 
that no one has a ghost of a chance of enforcing anti-abortion laws. Many have 
reluctantly reached Gov. Mario Cuomo's conclusion, that abortion should be 
removed from the field of legislation. To pass laws that would significantly 
lower only the number of legal abortions but not the number of abortions 
themselves -- such an action might be emotionally satisfying but hardly morally 
so. These thoughtful religious people are, in effect, anti-abortion and 
pro-choice. 
</P>
<P>
While longing for unity on this position, I recognize that all will not be of 
one mind regarding the inadvisability of criminalizing abortion. If what 
separates us is only a judgment call, I have no fears for our future unity on 
the issues that unite us. And you know my admiration for the way all members of 
Pax Christi embrace the "seamless garment" doctrine, which seeks to affirm and 
protect life both within the womb and without. The Reagan Administration 
discredited the pro-life movement by first preaching the sanctity of even 
unwanted pregnancies, and then attacking nutrition programs for pregnant 
mothers, Aid to Families with Dependent Children and food stamps. Ironically, 
today, those states most inclined to criminalize abortion are those with the 
worst records for public health care, education and civil-rights enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, I'm confident that I speak for both of us when I say that the chief 
enemy to life, inside or outside the womb, continues to be the arms race, 
which, despite the winding down of the Cold War, continues almost unabated. 
Because of the resources it saps, millions have died who could have lived, and 
the 50,000 nuclear warheads in the arsenals of the superpowers, have, of 
course, the capacity to abort the entire human race. 
</P>
<P>
As always, God bless you, dear Tom. I'd love to hear from you.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deficit Bill 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 272 to 128, the House approved a deficit reduction bill that puts 
the fiscal 1990 federal budget in compliance with Gramm-Rudman limits on annual 
indebtedness. The Senate then approved the measure by voice vote, and President 
Bush signed it into law. 
</P>
<P>
The "reconciliation" bill (HR 3299) would reduce red ink for the year that 
began Oct. 1 by at least $14.6 billion, lowering the deficit to the 
$110-billion level required by the Gramm-Rudman law. Legislated spending cuts 
would account for about $6.6 billion of the reduction and new taxes about $2.9 
billion. Forced across-the-board cuts, in effect until February under 
"sequestration" provisions, would reduce the year's deficit by $4.6 billion, 
and lower Treasury borrowing costs resulting from the bill would save $629 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Along with cutting the deficit and enacting new taxes in specialized areas of 
the economy, the bill makes several policy changes. For example, it reforms the 
way physicians are reimbursed under Medicare, prohibiting them from charging 
unreasonable fees that ultimately are paid by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The measure confronts the deficit more squarely than any of the annual 
reconciliation bills passed previously this decade. Still, it leaves 
entitlement programs virtually untouched, resorts to accounting gimmicks, such 
as moving the $1.8 billion Postal Service deficit and $420 million in Farm 
Credit System bailout costs "off budget," and once again pushes the most 
difficult fiscal and political decisions on taming the deficit into the next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey) said, "A yes vote provides for real 
deficit reduction." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Silvio O. Conte (R-Mass.) said the bill lacks "any significant effort 
to address the root cause of the deficit" entitlement programs. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the reconciliation bill.

Nevada Wilderness Bill 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 126 to 283, the House rejected an amendment to reduce by 40% the 
proposed Nevada wilderness area. Congress later sent to President Bush a bill 
(S 974) designating 733,000 unspoiled acres in the state as federal wilderness 
to be protected by law against logging, mining and other degrading commercial 
and recreational uses. All of the land is owned by the National Forest Service. 
This amendment sought to reduce the Nevada wilderness area from 733,000 to the 
412,000 acres recommended by Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yuetter, who 
oversees the Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
If Bush signs the bill, Nevada will become the 50th state to have U.S. 
wilderness areas under terms of the 1964 Wilderness Act. 
</P>
<P>
Amendment supporter Don Young (R-Alaska) said the bill was advocated by 
environmentalists and others "that think they have the God-given right to tell 
people that live on the land how they should live." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Peter H. Kostmayer (D-Pa.) said, "This so-called Draconian measure 
adds six-tenths of 1% of the state of Nevada to wilderness. I think that is 
very, very modest." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to reduce Nevada wilderness areas by 40%.

Dial-a-Porn 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 98 to 306, the House refused to remove "dial-a-porn" language from 
the fiscal 1990 appropriations bill for the departments of Labor, Health and 
Human Services, and Education (HR 3566). This preserved Senate language to 
outlaw or curb services that provide sexually explicit telephone commentary to 
callers. A 1989 Supreme Court decision struck down an existing "dial-a-porn" 
law as an infringement on free speech. The new language was signed into law by 
President Bush as part of HR 3566. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting to remove the language from the bill objected on procedural 
grounds. They disliked the way the Senate had loaded up HR 3566 at the end of 
the 1989 session with provisions not germane to the bill. They also objected to 
disregarding House rules and allowing an appropriations bill to be used as the 
vehicle for substantive changes in the law. 
</P>
<P>
But lawmakers on the other side of the issue said the House should seize the 
opportunity at hand to move against dial-a-porn services. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to remove dial-a-porn language from the pending 
appropriations bill.

Michael Chang broke his left hip in a freak mishap as he hit a tennis ball 
during practice in Florida Wednesday and might be out for eight weeks. Chang 
said he heard the sound of his hip breaking. 
</P>
<P>
"I went for a backhand deep in the corner and when I made contact, my hip 
cracked," Chang said Friday. "I heard it crack." 
</P>
<P>
X-rays have revealed a small crack about two millimeters wide in Chang's hip 
socket. The injury requires neither surgery nor a cast, although Chang expects 
to be on crutches for a month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just bad luck," said Chang, 17. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, who won the French Open in June, was selected Wednesday to be a member 
of the U.S. Davis Cup team that will play Mexico in a first-round match Feb. 
2-4 at La Costa, but he might be forced to miss that event. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if his hopes of playing against the Mexicans have been dashed, Chang 
said: "Pretty much." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Austin, Chang's agent at Advantage International, said: "He'd like to play 
it, but he's not going to jeopardize his career." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Davis Cup captain Tom Gorman said he and Chang have agreed to talk next 
week and then decide whether he should name a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just kind of in a holding pattern right now," Gorman said. "We'll just 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just a real freaky injury," he said. "The first concern of every player 
is he hopes it's not too bad. Then the rest sorts itself out." 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Krickstein has been named to play singles, and Rick Leach and Jim Pugh 
are the doubles team. Should Chang be unable to play the other singles, Gorman 
has four other candidates to chose from: No. 6-ranked Brad Gilbert, No. 7 Andre 
Agassi, No. 10 Jay Berger and No. 13 Tim Mayotte. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert may be the most likely candidate simply because he has experience in 
such matters. Gilbert was called in to replace John McEnroe when McEnroe hurt 
his shoulder at Wimbledon and could not play in the Davis Cup semifinal in 
Munich against West Germany last July. The United States lost, 3-2, but Gilbert 
won both his matches. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gilbert said he is not committed to playing even if he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be interesting. . . . I was pretty disappointed when I wasn't picked the 
first time around, so I'm reserved about my feelings," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I'll probably hear from Gorman, but I definitely wouldn't be 
surprised to see them choose Agassi. He's still No. 7 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, I think against Mexico, we can put five different teams on the court 
and still beat them." 
</P>
<P>
Chang's injury occurred near the end of an hour-long workout at the ATP 
headquarters in Ponte Vedra, Fla., where Chang was practicing with Brian 
Gottfried, his grass-court coach this year. 
</P>
<P>
Ranked fifth in the world, Chang was supposed to play in the $650,000 Stakes 
Match, an exhibition that began Friday at Palm Coast, Fla. Chang said he knew 
something was wrong when he heard his hip crack. 
</P>
<P>
"I just started to limp all over the place," he said. "I couldn't stop 
limping." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Paul Shirley, who is the ATP's medical director, examined Chang Wednesday 
at Baptist Medical Center in Jacksonville, Fla., and at first thought there had 
been only a muscle pull. X-rays were taken as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
Chang said doctors considered his injury, a fracture of the cup of the left hip 
joint at the point where the ball goes into socket, freakish. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it was really unusual because I didn't knock into anything," Chang 
said. "I had so much muscle power, or something, that it just cracked it. 
Usually, one doctor said, he sees it happen in contact sports like football or 
in car accidents." 
</P>
<P>
Chang said he would return home today to Placentia to recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
Chang said he is taking this setback in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"What else can you do?" he said. "Basically, I was really looking forward to an 
off-season because I wanted to work on a lot of things. Now, this kind of takes 
a lot of the timing away. I just try to look at everything as optimistically as 
I can."

A NEW MAN ON THE POINT FOR OWNERS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: CHARLES O'CONNOR TOOK OVER AT THE LAST MINUTE AS LEAD NEGOTIATOR FOR 
BASEBALL MANAGEMENT. WILL HIS OUTLOOK AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE TALKS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NASHVILLE, Tenn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a former high school catcher and lifelong baseball fan who graduated from 
Holy Cross and the Boston College law school, Charles O'Connor is heir to a New 
England legacy. 
</P>
<P>
He has been tormented, he said, by the cruel destiny of the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a picture of the left field wall at Fenway Park still hangs in 
his office at the Park Avenue law firm of Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius in New 
York. Rooting for the Red Sox may seem sublime compared to the tormenting task 
confronting O'Connor, a labor lawyer for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
As the recently appointed lead negotiator and interim executive director of the 
baseball owners' Player Relations Committee, O'Connor, 49, will try to convince 
the Major League Players Assn. that sweeping changes are needed in the economic 
structure of the collective bargaining agreement. He will try, in some measure, 
to turn back the clock. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal presented to the union includes a modified salary cap and 
restrictions on free agency, but the owners' quest seems to be for what 
O'Connor calls an "evening of the playing field," an attempt to put teams in 
smaller markets on a comparable footing with those in larger markets. 
</P>
<P>
This key to the owners' proposal is that all 26 teams share equally in the 
payment of salaries to players with zero to six years of major league service. 
Those salaries would be determined by performance statistics. Arbitration for 
players in that category would be eliminated. So would the need for agents. 
</P>
<P>
The first negotiations were held in New York last week. They will resume in Los 
Angeles Tuesday through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
If significant progress has not been made by the start of spring training, 
O'Connor said in his suite at baseball's winter meetings here the other day, 
the owners might resort to a lockout. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Rona, his predecessor, had targeted Feb. 15, but O'Connor won't specify a 
date, saying he has told the union only that the clubs want an agreement before 
the season, meaning before spring training. He cited the obvious reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The saving of spring expenses and payment of player salaries, coinciding, 
in most cases, with the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The desire to avoid a midseason shutdown, such as the 51-day player strike 
of 1981, and the pressures relating to completing the season once it starts. 
</P>
<P>
"Every labor negotiation has the potential for a lockout or strike," he said. 
"The fact of the matter is that 98% never use either weapon. The system 
functions so that the pressures exerted on either side -- the union with its 
strike and management with its shutdown -- are just that, pressure points and 
leverage points. 
</P>
<P>
"They point to the alternative, and usually when people look at the 
alternative, they find a way to resolve their differences." 
</P>
<P>
Both sides are financially prepared for a stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
Would the owners open spring training and continue to negotiate if there were 
assurance from the union that it would not strike? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor shook his head and said that the promise of labor peace for a season 
would not be enough. He said that the clubs require changes in the compensation 
system and would consider opening the season only if there was assurance of 
peace and some agreements already in place. 
</P>
<P>
A hard liner? O'Connor's reputation is that of a conciliator. He is a labor 
lawyer by choice, that being the only part of the law that ever intrigued him, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
His practice has been directly related to collective bargaining and contract 
enforcement in such industries as trucking, brewing, construction and public 
services. It is a career, he said with a laugh, that had seldom made him the 
subject of media attention. 
</P>
<P>
He and his labor-oriented firm -- one of the largest in the country -- were 
hired by then-Commissioner Peter Ueberroth two years ago to work with Rona and 
the PRC. 
</P>
<P>
Why Rona, who had been with the PRC throughout the '80s, resigned on the eve of 
the current negotiations is still not clear, although some maintain that he was 
pressured by owners who believed he contributed to collusion and the work 
stoppages of the last two labor negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Fay Vincent has emphasized improved relations with the union, and 
some owners reportedly figured there was need for a fresh face at the 
bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said he does not pretend to be a baseball expert and has trouble 
remembering which players are on which teams. He credits Rona for being an 
effective teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"His absence is a loss, but the transition won't be difficult," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
A conciliator? 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody in my business has to be optimistic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Conciliator? Yes. But the thing I'd be concerned about is that I don't think 
-- at least in my experience dealing with union leaders and management leaders 
-- that you should ever confuse civility with weakness. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, the person who is civil and willing to reach out, is also the 
one you have to watch the longest. 
</P>
<P>
"So I don't shrink from the term. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the one thing good lawyers have in common is the ability to find a way 
to conciliate an agreement." 
</P>
<P>
He will make his attempt at a time when the market has become a gold mine for 
the players. Seldom, even in the early years of free agency, has there been a 
more dramatic escalation of salaries. How does such spending equate to the 
owners' alleged need for changes in the compensation system? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said there are two aspects of it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The recent signings should address the union's legitimate concerns that the 
two collusion decisions permanently hurt the market's ability to bounce back. 
The market has worked its will and bounced back. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And in the process, he said, it should be providing a clear signal to the 
union that not all 26 teams can afford to play such a high-stakes game. The 
industry, with its current pattern, might soon belong to the big-market elite, 
undermining competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
The sides should take advantage of today's relatively good financial situation 
to produce a system that would assure long-term stability and cost-certainty to 
all 26 teams, a system to be eased in over the life of the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make the playing field fairer, not eliminate free agency," he said. 
"There would still be a free market because clubs would be spending their own 
money for players with six or more years, but the savings through a 1/26 
funding of the players in the zero-to-six category would provide the clubs with 
a measure of cost certainty and predictability. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the objective, but we're not married to any proposal. The manner in 
which you reach an objective is part of the bargaining process. We do happen to 
think that the statistical framework we came up with is a good starting point, 
a legitimate basis to judge players." 
</P>
<P>
Don Fehr, the union's executive director, conducted meetings with the 26 player 
representatives in Scottsdale, Ariz., this week and said the activity of this 
winter resembled the market before collusion. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the money being spent was the $100 million to $200 million that 
the clubs saved during collusion. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever validity there was to the clubs' claim of financial distress during 
the last negotiations, Fehr said, has long since evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
He said the industry is extremely healthy and that he expected increases in 
minimum salary and pension benefits. He said he couldn't address revenue 
sharing because the PRC has yet to define revenue or explain how much is to be 
shared. 
</P>
<P>
And of the new face at the bargaining table? Fehr wondered how talk of a 
lockout and economic warfare relates to conciliation. 
</P>
<P>
"I can make an argument that there will be a softening," Fehr said. "I can make 
an argument that there will be a hardening. I can make an argument that it 
doesn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I lean toward the latter. Barry Rona was not the policy maker. He took orders 
and acted on those orders. 
</P>
<P>
"Bud Selig (the Milwaukee Brewers' owner) was chairman of the PRC and is still 
chairman. The negotiations aren't driven by personalities but by issues. 
</P>
<P>
"If indeed Rona's absence is a softening, it should be apparent in the 
direction the negotiations take. We'll see in time."

NUMBERS RIGHT FOR LANGSTON; 
</P>
<P>
ANGELS: NEW PITCHER SIGNS $16-MILLION CONTRACT, TAKES NO. 12 OFF BACK OF 
MANAGER DOUG RADER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky paid $11.10 to get left-hander Mark Langston. The Angels had to 
give Langston $16 million and the shirt off Doug Rader's back. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, an avid baseball fan, got Langston's services at a bargain rate for 
his rotisserie baseball league. 
</P>
<P>
To get Langston for a run at an elusive first American League pennant, the 
Angels had to promise the 29-year-old pitcher a guaranteed five-year payoff, 
making at least one observer gawk at the limousine and armored car that drove 
up to Anaheim Stadium Friday and wonder which carried Langston to his 
introductory press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, who agreed to terms with the Angels last Friday, signed Friday after 
his session with reporters. He posed for pictures with team owner Gene Autry 
and General Manager Mike Port, holding his uniform shirt with his name and the 
No. 12 on the back. 
</P>
<P>
The number had belonged to Rader, but he relinquished it so Langston could 
continue a tradition begun in high school -- and fulfill a prophecy Rader had 
issued earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"As I was walking with him in spring training he said, 'You'll probably be here 
next year and I'll have to give up my number,' "Langston said. 
</P>
<P>
Just to be safe, he took a peek at the shirt before holding it in front of his 
gray pinstriped suit. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to make sure it didn't say Rader and they were deking me," Langston 
said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
All the numbers shown by the Angels were right for Langston, who professed no 
regret over signing relatively early in the free-agent chase and perhaps 
passing up an even more lucrative deal. Of the free agents left unsigned, San 
Diego reliever Mark Davis and Milwaukee outfielder Robin Yount are the two who 
could exceed Langston's deal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy with what I signed," said Langston, 16-14 last season with 
Seattle and Montreal and 86-76 lifetime. "If their contracts are bigger, fine. 
I don't think I could ever say I got a bum deal. The Angels are a first-class 
organization and I'm very excited about playing here. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Angels are definitely going to be the front-runner (in the 
American League West). The A's have got to be feeling pressure and they've lost 
some key players. Dave Henderson is my next-door neighbor (in Bellevue, Wash.) 
and he was saying how much they're going to miss Dave Parker. The Angels were a 
great team before I joined, and I hope I can add my two bits to it." 
</P>
<P>
And if they can add Yount . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I know they're trying very hard after Robin Yount," Langston said. "I'm a fan 
of Robin Yount. I enjoy the way he plays the game. He's always been a 
consistent player, a team player. I was hoping maybe Joe Carter would sign, but 
Joe's got to be pretty happy in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The Padres were among Langston's emotional preferences when he and his agent, 
Arn Tellem, began talking to various teams. They spoke with four American 
League and five National League teams. 
</P>
<P>
"The way (the Padres') situation is, they're kind of in turmoil a little bit 
because Joan Kroc is selling the team," said Langston, a San Diego native. "San 
Diego is one of the teams I wanted to get involved with. They were there, but 
there were teams I wanted to get more involved with. Their concern was to sign 
Mark Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we had to make our decision and I'm real happy with it. I didn't want 
to get into a situation where people were bidding back and forth. I just wanted 
to hear offers and make a decision. . . . The Dodgers were very competitive, 
very close. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, the no-trade clause was a very important issue. Having been traded, 
when you have to uproot your family, it's not fun to go through. The Angels 
jumped to it when we brought it up. It was something I didn't want to give up 
on." 
</P>
<P>
Playing for the Angels means he will have to give up hopes of winning a batting 
title. But a .175 average isn't much to give up in exchange for $16 million, 
the chance to regularly watch Gretzky -- "I'm a huge fan of his. I always 
followed him and since he's been with the Kings I've come down here to catch a 
few games" -- and the opportunity to live out a dream. 
</P>
<P>
That the Angels open next season April 3 in Seattle against his former 
teammates makes it that much sweeter. 
</P>
<P>
"Dollars and cents wasn't a big issue," he said. "It was more which 
organization I wanted to be with. I'm looking forward to being in a pennant 
race and being with a team that can win the whole ball of wax. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say there's not going to be pressure. There's going to be 
pressure in this game no matter what. I feel I can adapt to pressure. I had a 
lot of things going on last year and I felt I kept my focus on the game pretty 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'm going to play the game the same whether it's a one-year deal or 
five-year deal. I'm a poor loser and I'm looking forward to playing on a winner 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mike Port said that he didn't detour to see Robin Yount or Mark Davis on his 
way home from the winter baseball meetings in Nashville, Tenn. Refusing to be 
more specific, Port said he expected to know soon the outcome of some 
"inquiries and projects" discussed at the meetings. Asked if anything were 
close, he replied, "I could not tell you no."

TIMM ROSENBACH: QUARTERBACK IN WAITING; 
</P>
<P>
CARDINALS: ROOKIE FROM WASHINGTON STATE EAGER TO DISPLAY HIS TALENT IN THE NFL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quarterback Timm Rosenbach of the Phoenix Cardinals stands on the sideline 
wearing a baseball cap and carrying a clipboard as he charts the game while 
awaiting his chance to play. 
</P>
<P>
He has had only one chance, completing seven of 14 passes for 81 yards with no 
touchdowns and one interception in the fourth quarter of a 37-14 loss to the 
Rams last month at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The rookie quarterback runs the scout team in practice, mimicking the 
quarterback the Cardinal defense will face. Last week, it was Mark Rypien of 
the Washington Redskins, and this week it has been Raider quarterback Steve 
Beuerlein. 
</P>
<P>
Third on the depth chart behind Gary Hogeboom and Tom Tupa, Rosenbach is the 
highest-paid third-string quarterback in the NFL, earning a reported $5.3 
million over five years. 
</P>
<P>
But Cardinal fans are eager to find out how good Rosenbach is. 
</P>
<P>
With Phoenix all but eliminated from the NFL playoffs, fans have begun to 
clamor for Rosenbach, Hogeboom's heir apparent. 
</P>
<P>
Is it tough for him to sit and watch? 
</P>
<P>
"When you've never sat on the bench before, it's like your freshman year in 
college," Rosenbach said. "You sit there and take a lot of notes but you don't 
get a chance to execute." 
</P>
<P>
Although he hasn't played much, Rosenbach retains the cocky demeanor that 
marked his college career at Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterbacks are usually taught to spout cliches for the media, but Rosenbach 
is a free talker. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a little smart-alecky for his own good; I think they call that cocky," 
said Jim Walden, who coached Rosenbach for two years at Washington State. "But 
that was never a problem. It was a good thing about him." 
</P>
<P>
After wearing No. 3 in college, Rosenbach said he planned to wear No. 6 in the 
NFL because he was going to be twice as good in the pros as he was in college. 
</P>
<P>
Brash and outspoken, he has been compared to Jim McMahon, the San Diego 
Chargers' quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess there are some similarities between me and McMahon, but I'm not a Jim 
McMahon wanna-be or clone," Rosenbach said. "He's him and I'm me and hopefully 
I can make it on my own." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach has good credentials. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, he passed for 3,097 yards and 24 touchdowns in leading Washington 
State to its best season since 1930 with a 9-3 record and an appearance in the 
Aloha Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
After Coach Dennis Erickson left for Miami, Rosenbach left for the NFL. He was 
the second player taken in the supplemental draft last July behind quarterback 
Steve Walsh of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Would Rosenbach have stayed in college if Erickson had stayed in Pullman, 
Wash.? 
</P>
<P>
"He made his decision before I even thought about leaving," Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
After watching Rosenbach work out last June, some scouts were skeptical that he 
had the tools to be an NFL quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of (talk) going on about that," Rosenbach said. "If you talk to 
some guys, they'll tell you that I had a bad day, and some guys will tell you I 
did great. Scouts are scouts. They only know so much, the guys who know what 
they're doing are coaches." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach missed all of training camp because of a monthlong holdout and it put 
him behind at the start of this season. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach has one primary regret, that his father, Lynn, didn't live to see him 
play in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Diagnosed as having soft-muscle cancer in 1983, Lynn Rosenbach had his arm 
amputated in an effort to halt the spread of the disease. Doctors told him he 
had a 50-50 chance of survival if he didn't have the amputation and a 95-5 
chance if he did. The cancer went into remission for two years, but then 11 
tumors were discovered on his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
The illness drew father and son closer. The reason he enrolled at Washington 
State was to remain near his father, a WSU athletic department official. 
</P>
<P>
While Lynn Rosenbach battled for his life, Timm competed for his job as 
Washington State's starting quarterback after throwing 24 interceptions as a 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking he had no future as a quarterback, he was ready to move to safety 
until his father talked him into sticking it out. 
</P>
<P>
Timm won his contest, but his father lost his own, more serious fight. 
</P>
<P>
After a courageous struggle, Lynn Rosenbach died on July 1, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"It was rough, but fortunately football practice started so close after my dad 
died that I was able to get my mind onto other things," Timm said. "You don't 
ever forget about someone you've been with for 21 years of your life. 
Physically they're gone, but mentally they're always with you." 
</P>
<P>
According to Timm's mother, Lynn Rosenbach had a premonition that WSU would 
have a successful season. 
</P>
<P>
"Right before he died, Lynn said, 'I know that the Cougars are going to a bowl 
game,' " Rosie Rosenbach said. "It was incredible. I guess it was mental 
telepathy. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Lynn's death and his courage were such an inspiration to the community 
and to the kids on the football team. . . . I'll always think that the spirit 
of that season had a lot to do with Lynn." 
</P>
<P>
Did Rosenbach dedicate the season to his father? 
</P>
<P>
"I told the guys on the team that I wasn't going to dedicate the season to him 
because I played for him anyway," Rosenbach said. "There was no point in 
dedicating it to him. That's what he would have wanted me to do." 
</P>
<P>
But Rosenbach felt a void because his father wasn't alive to share his success. 
</P>
<P>
"I went from my father's death into a great bowl game and the Heisman voting 
(finishing seventh)," Rosenbach said. "And now, all of a sudden it was a 
letdown because there was nobody there. Of course, my mom was there, but my dad 
was such a big part of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach decided it was time to leave Pullman, because there were too many 
painful memories. 
</P>
<P>
"Timm really missed his father, and I think it was tough being around me all 
the time," Rosie Rosenbach said. "Although I wasn't crying all the time, I 
think it had a big effect on him. When he went to college, he said he was 
staying home for his father, and when the time came, he would leave. That was 
his time to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Rosie Rosenbach recalled that when Timm was born, he weighed in at just under 
nine pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to name him Timothy," she said, "but he was such a big baby that 
he didn't seem like a Timothy, so we just added an extra M. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always really well-coordinated. I happened to be his pre-school 
teacher, and at 5 years old he could outrun and outjump and outskip everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Athletics apparently must be in his genes. 
</P>
<P>
A football star at Western Washington, Lynn Rosenbach became a high school 
football coach, then spent 10 years at Olympic Junior College in Bremerton, 
Wash. He moved into athletic administration at Washington State, and was named 
to the Washington Coaches Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Timm starred in football, track and baseball at Pullman High School. He started 
as a running back, then was moved to quarterback as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
"I switched him to quarterback because we didn't have one," said Ray Hobbs, 
retired Pullman football coach. "He did a super job for us. He ran a couple of 
quarterback sneaks for over 50 yards for touchdowns." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach led Pullman to a 10-2 record and a spot in the semifinals of the 
State playoffs, then was recruited by Arizona State, Weber State and Montana, 
as well as Washington State. Walden, then coach at Washington State, had an 
advantage recruiting Rosenbach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for me to think of Timm as just another player, because my son, 
Murray, played on his high school team and he and Murray were best friends," 
Walden said, "Murray and Tim were Mr. Cools around school." 
</P>
<P>
While other colleges wanted Rosenbach as a defensive back, Walden saw him as a 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I watched Timm throw was when he was just goofing around at one 
of our practices, and I thought, 'Boy does that kid have a gun (arm),' " Walden 
said. "He was raw, but I thought I could train him to be a good quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he was going to be a five-year project. I knew he'd sit out a year, 
then I'd train him for a year; he'd make mistakes a year, and then we'd have 
two great years out of him. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the master plan, he just didn't know it. He had all the tools, but it 
was going to be a learning process because you just don't come into the Pac-10 
and be an all-learned quarterback with one year of high school experience. It's 
just not done. We planned on one bad year and two great years." 
</P>
<P>
Walden, however, wasn't around to reap the benefits, leaving for Iowa State. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson replaced Walden, junking the veer for a passing offense and installing 
Rosenbach as the starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first year was the first year that he played at all, and he struggled a 
little bit," Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
Depressed after throwing 24 interceptions, Rosenbach met with Erickson and said 
he didn't want to play quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that he had a great future and could play in the NFL," Erickson 
said. "I think he'll be a great pro. The problem this year was that he signed 
so late. I think you'll see him play more in the last three games because 
they're out of the hunt. I can't speak for the Cardinals, but I think he's 
their quarterback of the future."

NEWSWIRE: NFL CLEARS RYAN OF BOUNTY ON COWBOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An NFL investigation has cleared Philadelphia Coach Buddy Ryan of offering 
bounties to his players for injuring Dallas Cowboy players. Dallas Coach Jimmy 
Johnson accused Ryan of that after a game on Thanksgiving Day. 
</P>
<P>
The league warned, however, that severe penalties would be exacted against any 
team engaging in such activities. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL said its findings were based on an investigation by Commissioner Paul 
Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said the statement confirmed what he has been saying all along: "The 
Philadelphia Eagles did not place any bounties on Dallas players." 
</P>
<P>
Cowboy kicker Luis Zendejas was disappointed by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is that I told the truth," Zendejas said. "I guess it all depends 
on how lightly the guys who were investigating it took it. I guess they didn't 
take it too seriously." 
</P>
<P>
The teams will play again Sunday at Philadelphia.

Norm Sloan, former Florida basketball coach, and his top assistant coach told a 
grand jury that former Florida star Vernon Maxwell might have turned against 
them because he thought they had revealed his drug use to reporters, a 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony obtained by the Palm Beach Post, Monte Towe, said: "That's 
something he has blamed, I think, on us. But we didn't have anything to do with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Testimony by Sloan and Towe before the panel investigating drug use in the 
Gainesville area centered on Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell, Florida's all-time leading scorer, tested positive for cocaine use at 
the 1988 NCAA tournament. After that news broke, Maxwell's status in the NBA 
draft slipped. Projected as a possible first-round pick, he was not taken until 
late in the second round by the San Antonio Spurs.

HOLLYPARK INVESTORS FRUSTRATED; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: OPTIMISTIC FINANCIAL FORECAST BY TRACK DOESN'T FORESTALL CALLS 
FOR A CHANGE IN DIRECTION OF MANAGEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Hollywood Park's investors were told Friday that a dividend, which hasn't been 
paid for two years, is a possibility next year. Several shareholders responded 
by telling the board of directors that the track needs to change direction to 
become profitable again. 
</P>
<P>
The annual shareholders' meeting turned into a spirited two-hour session 
attended by about 200. Marje Everett, Hollywood Park's board chairman, and 
Warren Williamson, chairman of the track's realty investment trust, said that 
the sale of Los Alamitos, the reduction of the track's debt and the future of 
off-track betting would result in a better financial picture for the company, 
which lost nearly $10 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've turned the corner," Williamson said. "By next year, we should be 
looking at the possibility of restoring the dividend." 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park recently sold Los Alamitos, its sister track in Orange County, 
to a harness-racing group for $69.5 million. The money was used to reduce 
Hollywood Park's debt, but the track still owes about $45 million, $29 million 
of it to a bank at an interest rate of 12 1/2%. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson said that Hollywood Park hopes to commercially develop 50 to 70 
acres of the 340 acres it owns in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more, race tracks are seeking to do what Santa Anita did -- using 
excess property for things other than racing," Everett said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Santa Anita converted property next to the track into a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
One Hollywood Park shareholder, Ted Goldberg, criticized the way the track has 
been managed. 
</P>
<P>
"The shareholders have been misled and misinformed and the track has been 
mismanaged," Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
"The company lost $10 million, which to me isn't very encouraging. We sank $100 
million into Los Alamitos before it was sold. It's like saying that Abraham 
Lincoln enjoyed the play before John Wilkes Booth got there." 
</P>
<P>
One shareholder said the track has become "Schlockywood Park" and another said 
that she had received three times what she expected in damages from a fall at 
the track because Hollywood Park was reluctant to settle the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I was treated by the track's attorneys was typical," she said. "This 
is an example of what goes on here." 
</P>
<P>
Still another shareholder, George Hardie, said that he is the manager of a 
poker club and also considers himself to be among Hollywood Park's biggest 
bettors. 
</P>
<P>
"This board doesn't understand the philosophy of gambling," Hardie said. 
</P>
<P>
"The track ought to be sending limousines for bettors like me. I've heard the 
lottery used as an excuse for business being off at the track, but the lottery 
isn't hurting the card business. Business is down at the track because they 
don't schedule attractive betting programs. And the traffic at the end of a day 
is chaos, and the employees have an attitude that is complacent and cavalier." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Gamel, who was elected to the board Friday, was asked by a shareholder what 
changes he would like to see made. Gamel repeatedly has called for the ouster 
of Everett. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been assured by Marvin Davis (another board member) that the harmonious 
approach is the best way to go," Gamel said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be more conducive to progress. I've also been told that some of my 
thoughts about the company will be considered. I want to protect the 
significant stake I've got in the company, and to also protect the other 
shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
Gamel and Jeffrey Rhodes, who negotiated the sale of Los Alamitos for Hollywood 
Park, were also elected to the track's realty board.

POLL RANKS L.A. NO. 1 PLACE FOR APARTMENT INVESTING;

Investing in apartments is reviving, and Los Angeles is the most attractive 
market for it, according to a new survey released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles, closely followed by Washington, San Francisco, San Jose and Orange 
County, topped the list of the nation's 20 best places for apartment investing 
based on supply and demand, economic health and investment returns, said Grubb 
&amp; Ellis, a leading real estate brokerage firm based in San Francisco. New 
York ranked a lowly 18th on the survey. 
</P>
<P>
The survey comes at a time when investing in apartments is becoming 
increasingly attractive, according to industry experts. Previously, many 
investors preferred to put their money in commercial office space or 
single-family housing, where returns have been substantial over the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
However, the single-family housing market -- particularly in California -- has 
cooled lately. And most commercial office markets are overbuilt, leaving 
investors with high risks and scant returns. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, because fewer and fewer families are able to afford a single-family 
residence, apartments are gaining in popularity. Meanwhile, quality apartment 
houses are in relatively short supply, increasing their comparative value, said 
John B. Allen, senior vice president and director of investment marketing at 
Grubb &amp; Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
"Apartments are enjoying a real renaissance," added Barbara Pivnicka, 
spokeswoman for the Roulac real estate division of Deloitte &amp; Touche in San 
Francisco. "They are becoming much more popular with institutional investors." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the apartment revival stems from the rising cost of 
housing. According to recent statistics, buying a single-family residence has 
become difficult for most Californians. The statistics are not as dramatic in 
other states, but detached housing is still out of reach for nearly half of the 
nation's residents. 
</P>
<P>
Apartment living, consequently, has gained popularity, particularly for young 
families. Additionally, developers have been adding numerous amenities to 
apartment houses, such as gymnasiums, swimming pools and tennis courts, to make 
them more livable. 
</P>
<P>
"You think about the average young couple today, and you realize that they have 
to both work for several years just to get a down payment on a home. When they 
finally do, they find they're still going to be scraping by to make the 
mortgage payment every month," said Jack S. Cooper, managing director of Bank 
of America's Investment Real Estate Group. "So they are looking at it, and 
saying: 'Why should we do this? What's the matter with staying in an 
apartment?' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, investing in apartment buildings is not for everybody, said Stan Ross, 
co-managing partner of the accounting firm of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Apartments require a great deal of management," he said. "And there is very 
little liquidity." 
</P>
<P>
Investors are able to buy and sell stocks and bonds at a moment's notice, but 
selling an apartment can take months. And an investor in a hurry can lose money 
if the market slumps. 
</P>
<P>
But individuals can reduce the risks by investing in real estate investment 
trusts or mortgage-backed securities, Ross said. Those who want to take on 
greater risks but not deal with the upkeep of a building can buy stock in real 
estate firms, he added. And others might form investment groups with friends 
and real estate experts to buy into the market, he said.

'HEART,' THOUGH 'HASTY,' IS FILLED WITH WARMTH

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Human beings, curious creatures that we are, can be remarkably resourceful in 
forging emotional walls to separate us from our fellow man. Thus death, the 
final leveler of all walls, becomes the key character in "The Hasty Heart," 
John Patrick's story about a wounded Scottish soldier, who, unaware that he is 
dying, is left to spend his final days in the care of a nurse and a roomful of 
soldiers he neither knows nor likes. 
</P>
<P>
The drama, deftly laced with comedy at the North Coast Repertory Theatre, is 
the deeply affecting stuff on which series like "MASH" and "China Beach" are 
made. In fact, if no one has lifted this 1945 plot yet, it's probably about 
time. The show creaks with contrivance -- the soldiers each conveniently come 
from a different nation for which they are nicknamed: Yank (American), Digger 
(Australian), Kiwi (New Zealand), Tommy (English) and Blossom (African). And 
the irascible Scottish soldier, just as conveniently to the plot, has no family 
and no friends, making this group his absolutely last opportunity to make peace 
with his fellow man. 
</P>
<P>
There is no shortage of old truths here: when the nurse thanks Lachlen, the 
Scottish soldier, because his presence enriches her own, one can hear echoes of 
Tennyson's "Ulysses": "I am a part of all that I have met." 
</P>
<P>
But old truths are truths, nonetheless -- and worth being reminded of in a 
world where feelings are increasingly suspect and there is safety in cynicism, 
which passes all too easily for intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Director Andrew Barnicle keeps a deft hand on those feelings, which stay at a 
simmer under the clever repartee, bursting, at just the right moments, to a 
boil. The compelling star of the youthful cast, some of whom are a bit green 
about the edges, is Michael Deitering as Lachlen -- and he is terrific. 
</P>
<P>
Standing out against the aptly dingy Army-issue background designed by Terry 
Price (only the bright red blankets on the 
</P>
<P>
Army-issue beds serve as color relief), Deitering builds an intense emotional 
wall around himself that seems so palpable you can practically see it. There is 
wonderful support, too, particularly by the cheerfully rotund Kevin Mann with 
an Amadeus-like laugh as Tommy, Ron Choularton as the scrappy, scrawny Digger 
and Shana Wride as the stern but compassionate nurse, Margaret. If the others 
seem a bit awkward at times, it enhances the earnestness of their performances, 
which is just what you need in an unabashedly sentimental play such as this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
The lighting by Price is understated, as are the simple costumes by Kathryn 
Gould and the sound by Marvin Read. The focus stays, as it should, on Lachlen 
-- although his two key relationships could be better clarified. Does the nurse 
who professes love for Lachlen really love him, is she just trying to make his 
final days happy or are her feelings a puzzle even to herself? And does Yank 
(Joel Dorr) ever fully perceive that his love/hate feelings towards Lachlen 
give him a second chance to work out his ambivalence towards the dead Scottish 
grandfather who raised him? 
</P>
<P>
This "Hasty Heart" does not have all the answers, but what it does have, to the 
point of overflowing, is heart. It's a simple, well-made, old-fashioned play 
about death that is ultimately life-affirming. It is a show that teaches us not 
to defer acts of kindness to ourselves and others because we do not know how 
soon our last day will come. Like "A Christmas Carol," this show could not be 
more perfect for the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
Watching Lachlen's walls break down is a lot like chopping onions. If it 
doesn't draw tears, then maybe its time to get your ducts examined. 
</P>

RICK DU BROW: NBC HAS GRAND PLANS FOR CARSEY-WERNER'S 'GRAND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's called "Grand." It's the newest sitcom from Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner 
("The Cosby Show," "Roseanne"), whose deal to take over struggling CBS 
Entertainment fell through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
And NBC is so high on "Grand" that it will get the regular spot following 
"Cheers" starting Jan. 18, displacing "Dear John," which will be moved out of 
the power Thursday lineup and into another spot. 
</P>
<P>
We saw a rough cut of "Grand," and it's a bawdy, roundhouse comedy cutting 
through different levels of society in a small Pennsylvania town, with kind of 
an "Upstairs, Downstairs" approach. 
</P>
<P>
Lots of clout behind the show, besides Carsey-Werner. It's produced in 
association with Bill Cosby. And creator credit goes to writer Michael Leeson 
("Taxi," "The Cosby Show"), who also turned out the script for the new Michael 
Douglas-Kathleen Turner film, "The War of the Roses." 
</P>
<P>
With "Grand," Carsey-Werner -- and Cosby -- will control three of the five 
series on NBC's strongest night. The others are "The Cosby Show" and "A 
Different World." 
</P>
<P>
The last Carsey-Werner comedy, "Chicken Soup," was canceled because of its thin 
premise of a cuddly Jackie Mason involved with a somewhat docile Irish widow 
(Lynn Redgrave). "Grand," however, is packed with possibilities if the writers 
can keep it fueled. 
</P>
<P>
In the pilot, Pamela Reed plays a sexy domestic who lives in a trailer with her 
daughter, and works in the homes of the town's patriarch and an ambitious, 
newlywed couple. Michael McKean (Lenny in "Laverne &amp; Shirley") plays one of 
the newlyweds. John Randolph ("Prizzi's Honor") is the patriarch. And Ed 
Marinaro ("Hill Street Blues") guests as Reed's wandering ex-husband. 
</P>
<P>
FIRED: "I'm out -- it's true," said Ed Coghlan, news director of KCOP Channel 
13. He got the ax Thursday because, he said, station president Bill Frank 
"obviously didn't think the ratings were high enough." Coghlan's anchors were 
Wendy Rutledge and Warren Olney, who replaced the previously dismissed Tim 
Malloy. Chalk up another victory for competitor Hal Fishman over at KTLA 
Channel 5. 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAY CHEER: Swell idea by CBS to schedule a Christmas Day rerun of the 1971 
special that inspired "The Waltons." It's called "The Homecoming: A Christmas 
Story," will air from 3 to 5 p.m., and the cast includes Patricia Neal, Richard 
Thomas, Edgar Bergen and Ellen Corby. Since "The Waltons" was the basis of the 
Lorimar empire, this Christmas tale is really the show that started it all. 
</P>
<P>
FLIP SIDE: Pity that CBS is so weak nowadays that a terrific series like 
Candice Bergen's "Murphy Brown" has been pulling only 21% of TV viewers the 
last few weeks. The show would probably be a ratings smash on NBC. But it's 
getting no help from its fast-fading CBS lead-in, "The Famous Teddy Z." 
</P>
<P>
MUSCLE: Angela Lansbury, star of CBS' only Top 20 entertainment series, 
"Murder, She Wrote," really has the network by the ears. Every year they want 
her to return now, she negotiates an extra series for her company in exchange. 
Happened again this week. Nice lady, but CBS must privately hate being cornered 
like that. 
</P>
<P>
AS THOUSANDS CHEER: Good for the L.A. Telecommunications Commission for 
threatening to revoke Century Cable's franchise if it doesn't improve its 
service quickly. The wondrous American Movie Classics channel comes in so dark 
at times on my Century outlet that it's barely watchable. 
</P>
<P>
TRIBUTE: Walter Cronkite sent a message to the memorial get-together for Bill 
Stout this week at KCBS Channel 2. "Bill Stout was my hero," wrote Cronkite. 
Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates, who was sometimes a Stout target, said 
that he gave him a very special press pass. It had a photo of Stout and Gates 
together -- which made it easier for the newsman to get through police lines. 
</P>
<P>
REAL LIFE: The folks where she lived, Siler City, N.C., still called her "Aunt 
Bee" -- that was Frances Bavier of "The Andy Griffith Show," who died Wednesday 
at 86. Bavier reportedly fell in love with the town of about 5,000 while 
filming the Griffith series, and moved there 17 years ago. She lived with 
several cats and some attendants in a big stone house with 20 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
DATEBOOK: Vanessa Redgrave's interview this evening on CBS' "Saturday Night 
with Connie Chung" should be worth a look-see. That is, if Chung does a better 
job with her than she did earlier this season with Marlon Brando. You know, 
TV's got it all wrong. Wouldn't it be better just to hear Redgrave and Brando 
talking to each other? 
</P>
<P>
BEING THERE: "How come so many doctors are Jewish?" asked Sophia on "The Golden 
Girls." "Because their mothers are," replied a Jewish doctor.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TATTOO BAN MAY BE ALTERED TO ALLOW MAKEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ban on tattooing in Torrance may be modified to allow the application of 
permanent makeup, in which pigment is added to the skin around eyes, mouths and 
eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
This week, City Council members said they would like to change their 
30-year-old ordinance outlawing tattooing to allow both permanent makeup and 
cosmetic reconstruction, in which pigment is used to hide scars or return 
damaged skin to more natural tones. The council told staff members to prepare 
possible amendments to the city's anti-tattooing law for consideration Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Three cosmetologists were ordered to stop their tattooing services several 
weeks ago when a woman seeking a business license to offer permanent makeup 
protested the license's denial by showing city officials advertisements from 
the three businesses. One cosmetologist appealed the order to the council.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GARY COLEMAN'S MOTHER SUES FOR A 
CONSERVATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Gary Coleman's mother has filed suit to have a conservator named for the 
21-year-old former child star, claiming that a man hired as a chauffeur is 
managing his affairs and that Coleman is "at risk of financial exploitation." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Superior Court suit filed by Edmonia Sue Coleman charges that 
the nearly $7-million estate of the former star of NBC's "Diff'rent Strokes" is 
now being controlled by a friend of Coleman's named Dion Mial. 
</P>
<P>
Mial was hired by Coleman as his driver and "go-fer" at a salary of $325 a week 
and is now overseeing the estate, court papers said. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman has fired his business manager, agent, entertainment attorney and his 
parents in their role as personal managers and trustees. 
</P>
<P>
The petition, filed earlier this week, charges that Mial has cut off contact 
between the actor and his parents.

VAN NUYS BOY FOUND UNHARMED IN TIJUANA; BABY-SITTER IN CUSTODY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 3-year-old boy reported missing from his Van Nuys home was found unharmed 
Friday in Tijuana after he apparently wandered around the border city's airport 
by himself for a night, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's baby-sitter, who allegedly took the boy after a dispute with his 
mother, was taken into custody on suspicion of kidnaping, Los Angeles police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives from Los Angeles went to the Mexican city to unravel the kidnaping 
but by late Friday had not returned with the suspect, and it was unclear 
whether they would be allowed to, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police began to search for Hector Vasquez at 7 p.m. Thursday when his mother, 
Rosa Lopez, could not find him in their home in the 14700 block of Delano 
Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
After a search of the neighborhood failed to find the boy, police interviewed 
the boy's live-in baby-sitter, Alicia Lopez, 22, who is not related to the 
boy's mother. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Warren Knowles said the baby-sitter admitted taking the boy earlier in the 
day, driving him to Tijuana and then coming back. She agreed to accompany 
detectives back to the airport where she had abandoned the boy. 
</P>
<P>
After arriving in Mexico and contacting local authorities, the boy was found 
unhurt at the airport shortly after 5 a.m. Friday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"He had been there all alone, just walking around until they found him," Lt. 
Dennis Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
Alicia Lopez, a Mexican citizen who had been in the United States illegally, 
was being held by Mexican authorities, who had not decided by Friday evening 
whether to release her to the Los Angeles detectives. 
</P>
<P>
Knowles said she will face kidnaping charges if she is returned to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
If Mexican authorities decline to release her, she will be prosecuted for the 
crime there after the LAPD's foreign prosecution unit files a case with Mexican 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Knowles said the baby-sitter apparently took the boy because of an ongoing 
dispute with his mother, but the reasons for the dispute were not released. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the boy's parents and a grandfather drove to Tijuana and were 
reunited with him Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
It was also unclear if they would be able to return because the family also had 
been in the United States illegally.

ROBBINS ASKS COURT TO ISSUE ENTIRE TAPE MADE BY INFORMANT; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: THE STATE SENATOR ARGUES THAT THE VIDEOTAPE SHOWS HE REFUSED TO ACCEPT 
MONEY TO SUPPORT LEGISLATION.

<P>
A secret tape-recording of state Sen. Alan Robbins made by an undercover 
informant during the FBI's Capitol sting operation should be made public in its 
entirety, attorneys for Robbins argued in court papers filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins (D-Tarzana), allying himself with television stations that have 
requested release of undercover videotapes, asked U. S. District Judge Milton 
L. Schwartz to release portions of the tape not yet made public by federal 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins' attorneys contend that the entire tape will show that the senator 
turned down an offer of money from informant John Shahabian in exchange for 
supporting a bill. 
</P>
<P>
"The full transcript contains substantially more content than the edited 
version and demonstrates conclusively" that Robbins offered his commitment for 
the legislation "without hesitation, did not seek anything in return for his 
commitment and rejected Mr. Shahabian's suggestion of remuneration in return 
for supporting the legislation," the document says. 
</P>
<P>
The request to the court does not identify Robbins by name, using the same 
designation "legislator XX" used by federal prosecutors on the portion of the 
transcript already made public. 
</P>
<P>
But legislative sources confirmed that the legislator in question is Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
The tape of Robbins, as well as a number of other secret audiotapes and 
videotapes, will be offered by prosecutors as evidence in the ongoing trial of 
state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) on 12 counts of extortion, bribery, 
racketeering and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya's attorneys have opposed release of the videotapes, arguing among other 
things that they could be used by political opponents of the senator in his bid 
for reelection in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Release of audio and video tapes to the news media, with the attending 
likelihood that portions will be aired out of context and in a sensational 
manner, may have a very damaging effect in Sen. Montoya's reelection campaign," 
attorneys Bruce Kelton and Michael Sands said Friday in a letter to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins has been identified by sources familiar with the probe as a subject of 
the FBI investigation and is on a list of witnesses who may be called by the 
prosecution to testify against Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
Portions of the transcript released earlier show that Robbins suggested to 
Shahabian, a Senate staff member who was cooperating with the FBI, that Montoya 
would be willing to trade his vote for a $3,000 honorarium.

<P>
Shahabian, working on behalf of a bogus company set up by the FBI, asked 
Robbins what he would need to do to win passage of a bill ostensibly sought by 
the "company." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you need to make some arrangements with Joe" Montoya, Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what that would entail, Robbins said, "I mean what it'll take with Joe 
is, uh, a little envelope." 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, Robbins said, "I would say three" thousand dollars "would be 
sufficient. Twenty-five hundred'd probably" be "OK. . . . But if you wanna, 
y'know, make certain that he's absolutely committed, that's where Joe's at 
these days." 
</P>
<P>
An undercover agent subsequently gave the recommended $3,000 to Montoya at a 
breakfast meeting near the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
A videotape of the breakfast and the delivery of the money to Montoya will be 
introduced as evidence in the trial, said U. S. Atty. David Levi. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya has said the money was an honorarium that was not connected to his 
support for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Schwartz is scheduled to decide Tuesday on the request that copies of the 
tapes be made available to television stations and the public.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 'HOT LAB' OPPONENTS ADMITTED TO NRC CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An administrative law judge for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has 
admitted two more anti-nuclear groups and a homeowners association as parties 
to the dispute over the proposed relicensing of the nuclear "hot lab" at 
Rockwell International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory southeast of Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Federation of Scientists, the Committee to Bridge the 
Gap, and the Susana Knolls Homeowners Assn. were granted intervenor status by 
Judge Peter B. Bloch in an order dated Thursday. The groups join two other 
organizations and four local residents previously admitted as intervenors. 
</P>
<P>
The intervenors, all of whom oppose Rockwell's request, may file written 
evidence and take part in any negotiations aimed at settling the license case. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell has requested a one-year extension of the NRC license to operate the 
hot lab, a heavily shielded workshop where radioactive materials are handled by 
remote control. The company originally sought a 10-year renewal but scaled back 
the request because of local opposition and flagging business for the hot lab.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN SLAIN IN HOUSE, POSSIBLY BY BURGLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 50-year-old Sepulveda woman was found stabbed to death in her house, which 
had apparently been ransacked by her assailant, Los Angeles police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Gail Bronston was found dead about 5:30 p.m. Thursday when police 
investigated a call from a neighbor that something was wrong at her house in 
the 8500 block of Decelis Place, police said. The victim apparently had been 
stabbed a few hours earlier when she returned to the house, possibly surprising 
a burglar, police said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no arrests or suspects. Police said Bronston's 1981 Cadillac was 
found abandoned Friday afternoon in the parking lot at the Van Nuys Swap Meet 
in Sepulveda. It was unknown exactly what other property was taken from 
Bronston's house.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 5 YOUTHS ARRESTED IN SIMI AUTO VANDALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Simi Valley police have arrested five youths -- all present or former members 
of the Simi Valley High School band -- in connection with vandalism sprees in 
September and October, during which the windows of about 150 cars and trucks 
were smashed throughout the city, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Sgt. Kenneth Tacke said the youths used bricks, BB guns and a variety 
of slingshots to smash automobile windows in random sprees, causing about 
$15,000 damage. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the suspects, all 18, are scheduled to be arraigned Jan. 10 in Ventura 
Superior Court on charges of vandalism. They were identified as Trent Lunsford, 
Jody Schoolcraft, Scott Kuntuzos and Jeffrey Ravens, Tacke said. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, they could be sentenced to a maximum of six months in jail and a 
$1,000 fine on each count. 
</P>
<P>
The case of the fifth suspect, a 16-year-old, was referred to the county 
probation department. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Simi Valley High School Principal Jack Harris said only one of the 
four older youths is now a student at the school. Harris added that he himself 
was a victim of the automobile vandalism but declined further comment.

EL CAMINO REAL BATTLES GAMELY BUT LOSES, 20-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the presence of six two-way players, El Camino Real High held its own 
for more than a half in a City Section 4-A Division semifinal game Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Improbable? You bet. 
</P>
<P>
The Conquistadores, in fact, held a one-point halftime lead over powerful 
Dorsey. It was as though those two-way players had said, "No way." 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey's superior speed and depth, however, finally wore down El Camino Real in 
the second half as the Dons prevailed, 20-7, at Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
Dorsey, which last played in a City championship game in 1983 -- as a member of 
the 3-A Division -- will face Carson next week at El Camino College in 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
"They dominated us, and by that I mean they just had more size and quickness," 
El Camino Real co-Coach Mike Maio said. "The big play hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
Maio knows when somebody hits the home run, because he is also the school's 
baseball coach. And, indeed, Dorsey won it with the long ball. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey (9-3) trailed, 7-6, but took the lead on an 80-yard punt return by Kenya 
Smith with 4:58 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"No doubt about it," said Paul Knox, the Dorsey co-coach. "He broke the game 
open." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real's offense was unable to counter the Smith touchdown and gained 
just 42 yards in the second half. The Conquistadores finished with 105 yards to 
252 for Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
Lamont Warren, who rushed for a game-high 163 yards in 19 carries, punctuated 
the victory with a 44-yard dash through the right side with 4:52 left to give 
Dorsey a 20-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Their speed, that's what killed us," said El Camino Real fullback-linebacker 
Jamal Anderson, who was held to 54 yards in 12 carries. "We contained them, but 
when they got outside, it was just too much speed." 
</P>
<P>
And too little El Camino Real depth. 
</P>
<P>
"We were counting on that," Knox said in reference to the Conquistadores' 
two-way players tiring. "We knew they had a couple of guys on the line and a 
couple of linebackers who were going both ways. We knew that, eventually, a 
linebacker would be a step slow getting to the hole." 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real (6-6) held Dorsey to 116 yards in the first half and were helped 
by three Don turnovers -- two inside the El Camino Real 20-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
The Conquistadores, who had passed for just one touchdown all season, had two 
in two plays in the second quarter -- although only one counted -- on the in 
which it took the lead. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real linebacker Troy Snider recovered a fumbled Dorsey snap at the 
Dons' 26. After five running plays moved the ball to the 14, quarterback Tony 
Bordwell connected with receiver Kenneth Stewart on a lob play in the left 
corner of the end zone. The play was nullified because of an illegal man 
downfield, however. 
</P>
<P>
On third and 16 from the 20, Bordwell hit Anderson on a screen pass over the 
middle. Anderson darted into the left corner -- waving the ball at Dorsey 
defenders -- and sophomore Joseph La Firenza added the extra point for a 7-6 
margin with 3:44 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
The completion was Bordwell's only one in three attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey took a 6-0 lead in the first quarter, capitalizing on an eight-yard punt 
by La Firenza that positioned the ball at the El Camino Real 29. Warren scored 
from five yards with 49 seconds left in the quarter to close out the eight-play 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
Yet for El Camino Real, the loss was something of a moral victory. As recently 
as last season, the program was mired in a 24-game winless streak. Maio, in 
fact, hardly seemed downcast. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean this from the heart: I'm really proud of the way our guys played," the 
coach said, choking back his emotions. "Every guy stuck in there and held his 
own."

<P>
DEYOE RETURNS TO LEAD TAFT TO 60-41 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Senior forward Jason Deyoe showed no ill effects from a recent wrist injury 
when he scored 14 points, grabbed nine rebounds and blocked six shots to lead 
visiting Taft High to a 60-41 win over Van Nuys in a nonleague game Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Deyoe left a game Monday in the Simi Valley tournament after being hurt and sat 
out Taft's loss to Kennedy on Wednesday. But his return to the lineup allayed 
the fears of Coach Jim Woodard. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me at Tuesday's practice that he couldn't turn the key in the ignition 
of his car," Woodard said. "I was scared to death we had lost him for the 
season." 
</P>
<P>
X-rays showed no break, and Deyoe returned to action wearing a brace above his 
shooting hand. 
</P>
<P>
James Yoakum added 16 points and Cornell Hill scored 10 for Taft (3-2). In 
other nonleague games: 
</P>
<P>
Grant 69, Verdugo Hills 49 -- Rene Delahoya scored a team-high 19 points and 
Setro Terzian and Keith Weinstein each chipped in 12 to lead Grant at Verdugo 
Hills. Grant (4-0) broke open the game by outscoring Verdugo Hills, 39-26, in 
the second half.

HIGH-SCORING HART ROLLS OVER SAUGUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In only the second game of the season, Hart High basketball Coach Greg Herrick 
didn't expect to be pulling for his team to score 100 points. But that was 
about his biggest concern Friday night, as the Indians cruised to a 99-72 
nonleague win over Saugus at Hart. 
</P>
<P>
The subdued crowd came to life in the final minute as Hart neared the century 
scoring mark. Chad Hourigan missed the back end of a one-and-one with 13 
seconds remaining, giving Hart 99 points. Saugus turned over the ball on the 
ensuing inbounds pass, but the Indians returned the favor and had to settle for 
one shy of 100. 
</P>
<P>
"We started watching the scoreboard a little too much in the second half," said 
Herrick, whose team is coming off a 13-11 season. "But I thought our 
conditioning really kicked in in the fourth period, and we were able to wear 
them down." 
</P>
<P>
The Indians spread the scoring around while jumping out to an early lead. 
Forward Micah Ohlman sank three three-point shots in the first half on his way 
to a game-high 25 points. Hart (2-0) led, 25-20, after one period and held a 
50-33 advantage at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Herrick substituted freely in the second half and was impressed with the 
performance of his bench. Forward Chad Fotheringham also hit three three-point 
shots and finished with 17 points. Guard Andrew Lorraine added 13. Starters 
Renato Rivas, Marty Downen and Keith Halcovich each scored 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best depth I've had since I've been here," said Herrick, in his 
third year. "We expect to do well. It's nice to have so many guys to call on." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Dains, who led Saugus (1-3) in scoring with 17, sank a three-point shot to 
cut the deficit to 59-51. But that's as close as the Centurions would get.

CRESCENTA VALLEY TOURNAMENT;

<P>
JONES, N. HOLLYWOOD RALLY TO REACH FINAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
North Hollywood High, trailing by eight points midway through the third 
quarter, rallied behind All-City Section center Dana Jones on Friday night to 
defeat Palmdale, 61-51, in a semifinal game of the Crescenta Valley tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Jones scored 12 of his game-high 28 points in the fourth quarter. The Huskies 
(5-0) will play Crescenta Valley, a 56-34 winner over Franklin, in the final at 
8 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way you can stop a player of Dana's caliber," Palmdale Coach Garry 
Phelps said. "The only thing you can do is contain him." 
</P>
<P>
Until two minutes remained in the third quarter, Palmdale was ahead, 40-34, as 
center Jason Grimes had held Jones to 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
But Jones scored seven consecutive points in the final two minutes of the third 
quarter, a warning to Palmdale as the Huskies pulled to within 42-41. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams traded baskets in the first two minutes of the fourth quarter before 
Jones scored on two rebound layins during a 10-4 Husky streak, putting North 
Hollywood ahead, 53-46. 
</P>
<P>
"We go as Dana goes," North Hollywood assistant Eli Essa said. "But we're not a 
one-man team." 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood hadn't previously trailed at halftime. The Huskies' comeback 
coincided with Robert Hill shutting down John Johnson, Palmdale's leading 
scorer. Johnson scored only seven of his 21 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies' full-court press also harried Palmdale into several fourth-quarter 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley 56, Franklin JV 34 -- The Falcons played Franklin's junior 
varsity because the Franklin varsity played Marshall in a nonleague game 
earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin, however, pulled to within 27-23 midway through the third quarter 
before Crescenta Valley (5-0) went on an 18-4 run to take a 45-27 lead. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada 83, Burroughs 63 -- La Canada made nine of 13 three-point shots and 
Jeff Lord scored 23 points as La Canada won the consolation-bracket game. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans (3-2), ranked second in the 3-A Division, hit three three-point 
shots in the third quarter to turn a one-point halftime lead into a seven-point 
advantage entering the fourth quarter and outscored Burroughs, 26-12, in the 
last five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Berns added 15 points for La Canada and Sean Whiting 14. Ray Velasquez 
led Burroughs (3-3) with a game-high 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Murphy 54, Burbank 45 -- Daniel Murphy took advantage of 22 Burbank 
turnovers as the Nobles won their first game in a consolation semifinal.

TELEVISION: WHILE TOP PRODUCERS MARCY CARSEY AND TOM WERNER WERE DEALING WITH 
CBS THIS WEEK ABOUT JOINING THE NETWORK, ROSEANNE BARR WAS PRESSURING THEM OVER 
HER POPULAR SITCOM.

<P>
Roseanne Barr, whose first feature film, "She-Devil," opened Friday, appeared 
this week to be attempting another coup to have an executive producer of her 
top-rated ABC show removed, sources familiar with the situation said. 
</P>
<P>
The internal fracas over the show's creative direction comes exactly one year 
after a feud between Barr and "Roseanne" creator-executive producer Matt 
Williams resulted in his departure. Williams left the show in January, after 
the Christmas and New Year's production break. 
</P>
<P>
Barr, who did not report for work on the set of "Roseanne" earlier this week, 
has complained about executive producer Jeff Harris' ideas for the show and 
wants him out, said an ABC source who called the situation "a mess." 
</P>
<P>
There also were unconfirmed reports that Harris and another "Roseanne" 
producer, Danny Jacobson, have tried to remove Barr's fiance, Tom Arnold, from 
the writing staff, heightening tensions. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent disarray on the show coincides with a confusing interview Barr 
gave to "Today" show correspondent Jim Brown on Tuesday. Brown asked her what 
she would do about her TV career if "She-Devil" becomes a hit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm outta there," Barr answered. "That's what happens." She also told Brown 
that even if her new movie fails at the box office, "I'm going to leave TV 
anyway. What the hell." 
</P>
<P>
ABC referred calls about the matter to the show's producers, the Carsey-Werner 
Co. The company's spokesman had no comment. Barr's manager and her publicist 
declined to comment, and Harris did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Barr has been known to be exceedingly concerned about creative control of the 
series, which is the most popular TV program in the country. After Williams 
left as executive producer of the program in January, executive producers Marcy 
Carsey and Tom Werner issued a statement saying that Barr had been given 
creative control over her character and that it was Barr's insight into working 
women that made the show appealing.

CINEMATHEQUE CELEBRATES ART OF MUSIC VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And here you thought music video was just glamour boys with poufy hair preening 
behind blemish-obscuring smoke -- money for nothing, as it were. 
</P>
<P>
But this relatively recent genre represents something else entirely to the 
American Cinematheque, which, in conjunction with the Long Beach Museum of Art, 
has scheduled this weekend a mini-festival whose brave assertion -- as stated 
in its printed program -- is nothing less than that "music video is the art 
form of the '80s." 
</P>
<P>
To prove it, more than 100 titles grouped into seven programs will run at the 
Directors Guild, 7920 Sunset Blvd., beginning at 6 tonight with the premiere of 
a documentary on Soviet rock and continuing all day Sunday. The focus is 
largely on how the form has unexpectedly brought true experimental film making 
to the masses. 
</P>
<P>
"Robert Longo's Megadeth video, 'Peace Sells (But Who's Buying?),' has almost 
1,000 edits in it," said an admiring Michael Nash, media arts curator of the 
Long Beach museum, who put together the exhibition for his museum in August and 
has had it on the road ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unimaginable before the inception of MTV that you could make 
programming that would appear on a commercial venue that would move that fast. 
. . .," he added. "But people are learning to be able to move faster and faster 
and are willing to fill in the blanks a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
Nash's presentation encompasses both the ambitious origins and -- he hopes -- 
expansive future of music video. "Audio Auteurs" (showing tonight at 7) 
showcases such early work as Devo's 1977 "In the Beginning Was the End," an 
11-minute video that has the crude power of a snuff film crossed with a bizarre 
industrial education trailer. 
</P>
<P>
Nash's hope for the future can be seen in "Vanguard Re-Visions" (Sunday, 8:45 
p.m.), featuring experimental forays into video art, and "Unseen Music" 
(Sunday, 6:15 p.m.), which showcases videos from independent record labels. 
</P>
<P>
Also of interest: "Ad Art" (tonight, 9:30), which includes amusingly 
self-reflexive clips by the Replacements, Tom Waits and Les Rita Mitsouko; 
"Extended Plays" (Sunday, 4:30 p.m.), "video albums" by The The and R.E.M., and 
"Digital Harmony" (Sunday, 2:30 p.m.), a work for computer by composer John 
Whitney Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Receiving its U.S. premiere tonight at 6 (its first of six showings) is Ken 
Thurlbeck's "USSR&amp;R: Rock on a Red Horse," a fitfully intriguing 
documentary about the underground Soviet rock scene. 
</P>
<P>
General admission prices are $5; $3 for Cinematheque members. Information:

VETERAN BROADCASTER HERMAN DEPARTS KFWB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Veteran Los Angeles broadcaster Cleve Herman, who has been with KFWB-AM (980) 
as a sports and news reporter since 1952, has left the station, the 
fast-talking radio man said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
While Ken Beck, the all-news station's news director, described the departure 
as retirement, Herman said that he "would not describe it as retiring, but 
regrouping or retooling myself for what 1990s news is going to be. We (he and 
station management) had grave professional and philosophical differences about 
the news and reporting that has caused us to have an amicable parting." 
</P>
<P>
Herman, 72, was last heard on the station last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Herman worked at KFWB for 37 years, reaching back to a time when the station 
was No. 1 in the local market with a mix of Top 40 music and news reports, and 
he said he had intended to work well into his 80s. 
</P>
<P>
He plans now to work on a novel about the radio business and he said he is open 
to other broadcasting opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Herman worked at both the Los Angeles Express and the old Daily News before 
moving to broadcasting in 1952. STEVE WEINSTEIN

CENSORSHIP FORUM SET FOR SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of San Diego artists has scheduled a public forum -- paid for under a 
National Endowment for the Arts grant issued to support a public education 
campaign dealing with censorship issues -- for Sunday titled "Art: Framed, 
Censorship and the NEA, 1989." 
</P>
<P>
It will last from noon to 3 p.m. and be at the Installation Gallery, 930 E St., 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The program will include an appearance by Elizabeth Sisco, a San Diego artist 
who resigned from an NEA visual arts review panel last month to protest the 
endowment's withdrawal of a grant -- later reinstated -- for an AIDS-related 
art show in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Sisco said the program was not intended to be directly provocative. But a press 
release announcing it said the NEA-funded program will address the question "Is 
art which dares to criticize too much art for the U.S. government to support?"

TOY COMPANY OFFERS KIDS A CHANCE TO GIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
'Tis the season to be giving, and Mattel U.S.A. is offering children a chance 
to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawthorne-based toy manufacturer is sponsoring a national drive to collect 
gifts to distribute to sick, disabled and underprivileged children through 
national and Southern California charities. Its "Mattel Kids Care Too" 
campaign, which kicked off Oct. 14, runs at various sites until Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
"Mattel has been looking for a program to support community groups," 
spokeswoman Elizabeth Thomas explained. "This is a way of working with 
retailers, a way of giving back to children, since obviously children have 
supported Mattel over the years." 
</P>
<P>
The firm will donate $250,000 cash and $2 million in new toys, including some 
of its most popular ones. 
</P>
<P>
Children may donate toys at: Long Beach Children's Museum, through Dec. 22; 
Movieland Wax Museum, through Dec. 20; Westside Pavilion, through Dec. 22; 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, at Children's Symphony on Dec. 16; IMAX Theater in 
Exposition Park on Dec. 16; Knott's Berry Farm, today; Olvera Street, Las 
Posadas, Dec. 16-22; Santa's Village, through Dec. 20. Information: Mattel, 
(213) 978-5648. 
</P>
<P>
The company offers these tips on showing children the importance of giving: 
</P>
<P>
* Teach your child the whys of giving. Explain the significance of gifts at 
birthdays or religious holidays to give meaning to the act of giving. 
</P>
<P>
* Help your child learn to give appropriately with the "what?" and "how?" 
questions. What does this person mean to me? What does this person need? How 
can I help? 
</P>
<P>
* Let your child decide what to give. Encourage initiative ("What does Grandma 
enjoy?") rather than dictating a choice with suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
* Show your appreciation for a child's efforts by using the gift. If you 
receive a hamburger key chain or purple change purse, use it rather than 
leaving it in a drawer. Children notice. 
</P>
<P>
* Use gift selection to explore relationships. Explaining why a gift may be too 
expensive or too personal is a chance to explore the different levels of 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
* Make gift giving an adventure. Involve your child in the whole process of 
planning, buying, wrapping and giving. 
</P>
<P>
* Set up a matching fund. For every penny your child saves from allowance for 
gifts or charity, reward him or her with a matching donation. 
</P>
<P>
* Organize a Holiday Fair. Kids can shop inexpensively, making their own 
purchases from a selection of donated new gifts for sale at nominal prices. 
This encourages responsibility toward gift giving. 
</P>
<P>
* Set an example. Tithe or contribute to holiday funds when shopping. Take your 
child along when giving used clothing or canned goods to charity. Give your 
child something to contribute and discuss your reasons for giving. 
</P>
<P>
* Find examples of giving in daily life. Discuss with your child acts of 
heroism, charity and giving that appear in the news or happen in your 
community. 
</P>
<P>
* Offer alternatives to buying gifts. Suggest that your child make a gift or 
offer a service such as washing a car or taking care of a pet. Make homemade 
gift certificates and wrap them like presents. Follow up to make sure your 
child keeps his promise. 
</P>
<P>
* Ask relatives to write thank-you notes to your child. In this way, giving is 
validated and the child learns good manners from their example.

LEARN ABOUT A GARDEN THAT USES LITTLE WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SIDNAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Horticulturist Tom Ash says the average homeowner in Southern California opts 
for a landscape that is better suited for a water-rich area like Seattle, 
rather than the semiarid climate of the Southland. We seek lush lawns studded 
with trees and bordered with colorful annuals. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is an attractive alternative. With the use of plants that need little 
water, and by grouping plants according to their water needs, one can have a 
beautiful landscape and save water, time, money and headaches. 
</P>
<P>
Ash, of UC Riverside, is the garden director of a new water-wise demonstration 
garden in Riverside, aptly named "Landscapes Southern California Style." 
</P>
<P>
The garden, a joint venture between UC Riverside Cooperative Extension and the 
Western Municipal Water District, is the only facility of its kind on the West 
Coast. Its mission is strictly educational, and water conservation is its goal. 
</P>
<P>
Since "Landscapes Southern California Style" opened in June, the public 
response has been favorable. This is in one of the fastest-growing areas of the 
nation, and new homeowners are flocking to the garden to get landscaping ideas. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a typical botanic-type garden, and although it features beautiful 
plants, the plants are selected for their practicality in Southern California 
landscapes, where water is precious. This means that the plants in the garden 
have been chosen for their water-efficiency and their low-maintenance 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Take ground covers. As substitutes for lawns, ground covers require far less 
water and maintenance. One can save about 40 hours of lawn work over a year by 
planting or replacing a lawn with ground cover plants. It will also save up to 
60% of the water required by a typical lawn, Ash says. 
</P>
<P>
Ash especially recommends three ground covers. The first, clumping gazanias, 
take much less water than their cousins the trailing gazanias. The plants have 
dark-green foliage and a display of yellow, orange or maroon flowers from 
spring to fall. 
</P>
<P>
The second, verbena, is quite drought-resistant and is one of the more colorful 
ground covers. It provides a green carpet covered with pink, red or purple 
blooms from spring to late summer. Ash particularly recommends verbena for 
sloping landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
The third ground cover, lippia, is a tight, low-growing lawn substitute with 
purple and white blooms from spring to fall. 
</P>
<P>
Hydro-zoning -- grouping plants according to their water needs -- results in 
water conservation and adds to the health of plants. For example, Ash says, it 
is a common practice to plant trees in a lawn. But trees and grasses are at the 
opposite end of the water-needs spectrum. Lawns need short, frequent watering 
because of their shallow root systems, and most trees require deep, infrequent 
watering. 
</P>
<P>
Planting trees in lawn areas means that the frequent, short waterings force the 
tree's roots toward the surface. The roots lift sidewalks, crack driveways and 
foundations and interfere with lawn-mowing. And because their roots are 
shallow, the trees can blow over in strong winds. 
</P>
<P>
The "Landscapes Southern California Style" garden features 32 species of trees. 
Among these are the crape myrtle with its pink, white, red or lavender flowers; 
a number of cultivars of eucalyptus, palms and sycamores; many native trees 
such as the California pepper, and the valley oak and many less-known but 
drought-tolerant species. 
</P>
<P>
What about flowers in a drought-tolerant, low-maintenance garden? 
</P>
<P>
Ash says annuals are too thirsty and require too much time and replacement 
effort during the year. Instead, his garden uses perennials, wildflowers and 
ground cover for year-round color. 
</P>
<P>
For those who ask him to recommend a flower that is drought-tolerant, 
low-maintenance and likely to bloom all year, Ash smiles and suggests: "Plastic 
flowers." 
</P>
<P>
Ash points out that four of the most popular shrubs -- India hawthorn, 
pyracantha, pittosporum and photinia -- will thrive with half the water usually 
given them in a Southern California landscape. He says over-watering is the 
leading contributor to plant disease. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty education stations throughout the garden help visitors take self-guided 
tours. Subjects range from drip and other water-efficient irrigation methods to 
the various soil types in the Southland. One station features an extensive 
demonstration of the use of fire-resistant plants in the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its collection of plants, "Landscapes Southern California Style" 
demonstrates the use of rocks, decks, various artificial and natural mulches, 
and a dry, rock-lined stream bed. 
</P>
<P>
The garden is open Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission is free. 
The garden is set up for self-guided tours, and Tom Ash is there on Saturdays 
to answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
The garden is at 450 E. Alessandro Blvd., Riverside. From California 91, go 
east on Central Avenue; Central Avenue runs into Alessandro. The garden is 
about 4 miles from the freeway. Phone (714) 780-4170. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with its educational mission, the garden offered landscaping 
seminars on some Saturdays in the fall. The charge was $2. Seminars are 
expected to be resumed in February.

BOB GREENE: IT'S NOT ONLY ROCK 'N' ROLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB GREENE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No matter what kind of music you like, you have to give credit to the Rolling 
Stones' current tour as a magnificent entrepreneurial accomplishment. By the 
time the tour concludes in a few weeks, the band is expected to have made in 
excess of $100 million -- not bad in a year during which other major 
corporations (and the Rolling Stones are a corporation) have seen their profits 
dwindle or disappear. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you're a senior executive of some multinational conglomerate and you 
don't like Mick Jagger's voice -- or have never heard it -- you ought to salute 
his management skills and business savvy. The guy could probably run General 
Motors. 
</P>
<P>
As the tour winds down, though, I find myself thinking not so much about the 
music, or even about the $100 million, as I do about the two Ronnies. Time and 
happenstance can change so many things. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972 there was a British rock band -- one of the best bands I have ever 
heard -- called the Faces. On assignment for Rolling Stone magazine, I went out 
on tour with them. There was a certain tension in the band -- the lead singer, 
Rod Stewart, was developing a following of his own, and his growing fame was 
threatening to break up the band, which it eventually did. 
</P>
<P>
On this tour, though, the band was terrific, and after a concert in Clemson, 
S.C., a day of rest had been built into the schedule. Behind the hotel was a 
lake. Four of us went out in the afternoon sun and sat on a wooden dock, 
passing a bottle of brandy back and forth. There was Stewart, and there were 
two guitar players from the band -- Ron Wood and Ronnie Lane. 
</P>
<P>
After a while, we went back to the hotel parking lot and divided into teams. We 
kicked a soccer ball around. It was Stewart and I against the two Ronnies. We 
played until it got dark. 
</P>
<P>
I think about the two Ronnies now; at the time they knew that the Faces would 
probably disband. Undoubtedly they wondered what would happen to them after 
Stewart went out on his own. Things couldn't have ended up much more 
dramatically different for them, it turns out. 
</P>
<P>
A job opening developed in another band. If you are employed by, say, General 
Foods, maybe you're always on the lookout for a job opening at, say, Coca-Cola. 
It works the same way in music. 
</P>
<P>
The Rolling Stones had a sudden opening for a guitar player. Ron Wood applied 
for the job and got it. Not a bad career move -- from the Faces to the Rolling 
Stones. That's where he is now, and if you've been following the current tour 
you've seen pictures of him on stage. 
</P>
<P>
And Ronnie Lane? I saw a picture of him the other day, too. After leaving the 
Faces, Ronnie Lane developed multiple sclerosis. The picture showed him sitting 
in his wheelchair. He has lost the use of his legs, and at the age of 43 he 
weighs 110 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way life works. Always has -- forks in the road, and the direction 
is not always yours to choose. It just seems all the eerier when it happens to 
rock 'n' rollers, who live in a fantasy world but who are not exempt from 
life's eternal puzzles. 
</P>
<P>
The two Ronnies, full of brandy and full of energy, playing soccer in the 
parking lot of a South Carolina Holiday Inn . . . now one's a Rolling Stone, 
and perhaps the other is following the news of the tour. 
</P>
<P>
Might as well end this on a not-so-somber note. There is a wonderful photo that 
was taken when the Rolling Stones first came to the U.S. in 1964. Young and 
desperate for publicity, the band members walked out into the middle of 
Michigan Avenue during a visit to Chicago. They just stood there until someone 
took their picture. It was one way to get noticed. 
</P>
<P>
The other night I was looking at a menu from a gourmet Chinese restaurant in 
Chicago. Most of the entrees -- Yu Hsiang Pork, Sichuan Shrimp -- bore 
traditional Oriental descriptions. But one caught my eye.

It was called Beggar's Chicken. "Mick Jagger's favorite!" the menu said. "Our 
version is prepared with a Rock Cornish hen. An unusual and unique flavor with 
many tasty bones to pick. Last time Mick Jagger dined with us he had two 
servings." 
</P>
<P>
Who knows? Jagger and his friends certainly don't have to stand in the middle 
of traffic anymore in order to be noticed. The restaurant using his name on its 
1989 menu is probably not all that different from all the restaurants that, in 
1959, displayed framed glossies of Frank Sinatra on their walls.

DESIGNING WOMEN; 
</P>
<P>
FOR STUDENTS AT THE FASHION INSTITUTE, INSPIRATION IS WHERE THEY FIND IT -- AND 
HOW IT LOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE SEIPP, Seipp is a Beverly Hills free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Caroline Vega and her roommate alternate using the kitchen, but neither of them 
is fighting for rights to the stove. She's a student of fashion design, he's a 
writer, and they both want dibs on the kitchen's picnic table. 
</P>
<P>
"I work on a wooden picnic bench that's set up in the kitchen. It's a big old 
mess," she says. "Yesterday John was typing, so today I'm sewing." 
</P>
<P>
Vega, 20, is a student at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in 
Sherman Oaks, where "struggling" always seems to accompany the word "designer." 
She and fellow students Yael Kempler and Patricia Timmel share enthusiasm for a 
profession in which it isn't easy to make a name for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Vega, a second-year design student, is, like her peers, constantly creating new 
designs. Something seemingly mundane, like walking Ventura Boulevard, can get 
her going. 
</P>
<P>
"If I see something that's totally popular, and I hate it -- I'll go just the 
opposite," she said. She likes to mix contrasting lengths and silhouettes, and 
cites Cher as someone she'd like to design for because of her free spirit. She 
also identifies with name designers Isei Miyaki and Theirry Mugler. 
</P>
<P>
"I like wide-legged pants a lot," she said, and refers to her recent creation 
of a "flared, slightly bell-bottomed pair." 
</P>
<P>
Her fashion sense is rooted in a semi-rural past. "I grew up in Santa Paula in 
Ventura County. It's kind of rural. I joined 4-H when I was 10 and that's when 
I started sewing," she said, acknowledging that her Mexican-American heritage 
also played a significant role in developing her flair for bright, flashy 
colors in flowing and feminine designs. 
</P>
<P>
For Kempler, who also lives in Sherman Oaks and is a second-year student at the 
institute, the pursuit of fashion design makes perfect sense. The 24-year-old 
native Israeli, who moved to the United States three years ago, used to sell 
her clothing on blankets on the busy streets of Rehovot, a town 20 minutes from 
Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
"All my life, I sewed. But I didn't know patterns," she said, remembering the 
long hours she spent as a young girl, working with her mother over the sewing 
machine. "I have always invented clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Kempler spends at least three full days a week conceptualizing and sewing her 
designs. On weekends, she sketches for as long as five hours a day. She also 
teaches Hebrew two afternoons a week at a nearby temple. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't go to sleep until I have the idea in my mind of how the design will 
look. In the morning, I wake up thinking about the same idea," she says. 
Kempler finds she is most influenced by the ethnic clothing of India, South 
America, the Far East and Israel, offering as an example her full-legged, 
harem-style pant designs. 
</P>
<P>
She likes to mix fabrics -- silk, chiffon, cottons or rayons -- in an outfit. 
"Let's say I make a skirt," she said. "I will have a lot of different fabrics 
in that skirt. . . . It will be maybe a draped skirt, very full and tumbling." 
</P>
<P>
Timmel, 29, and also in her second year at the institute, has been making her 
own clothes since she was 15, when she shot up to her full 5-foot, 10-inch 
height while other girls were still in training bras. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was younger, nothing fit me -- I had to create my own look," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, she concentrates on sexy, slim-fitting outfits. An avid nightclub-goer, 
she enjoys making comfortable, yet stylish clothes for dancing, often using 
black Lycra. In addition, she likes working with brightly colored taffeta and 
some denim fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in my wardrobe matches," said Timmel, who does free-lance custom work 
out of her West Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
Like Vega and Kempler, Timmel often has spontaneous ideas. "I don't just sit 
down and design something. It comes to me while I'm driving down the road or 
whatever," she said. 
</P>
<P>
What does it take to make it in the world of fashion design? 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Bremer, executive director of public relations at the institute, said it 
takes drive and hard work, just as success in any other profession does. 
</P>
<P>
"The success rate varies," Bremer said of the students on the campus, which 
opened in 1971. "To a large degree it depends upon the talent of the designer. 
Randy Duke and Kevin Hall are two of our success stories. Other students are 
doing well but are not necessarily famous yet. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them do work for someone else. I would say 96% of the students who 
graduate from FIDM are placed in jobs for which they've been trained." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the Sherman Oaks campus, the school has branches in Los Angeles and 
Orange County. Student enrollment varies between 150 to 200 a year. And the 
cost? It isn't cheap. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, the school is expensive," Bremer said. "It's from $8,000 a year, 
depending on your major. But that includes all of your books and materials." 
</P>
<P>
And competition, even at the student level, is also steep. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really cutthroat, just like the industry," said Vega, who works as a 
sample cutter at Candy Kiss, a children's clothing store in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"The competitiveness between students does exist," Bremer said. "But that comes 
with any field where you want to succeed. If you don't have that kind of 
spirit, you're not going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
Vega's job as a sample cutter -- someone who essentially cuts out sample 
garments -- doesn't offer much challenge to her creativity, but she plans to 
stay with it after her graduation to gain practical and business experience. 
Ultimately, she hopes to open a boutique featuring her own line of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Like everyone else, I want to do my own thing," she said. "I might want to go 
into lingerie or leather, something totally different from what I'm doing now."

THE TIMES POLL; 
</P>
<P>
BISHOP CALLED OUT OF LINE IN KILLEA PRO-CHOICE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON, TIMES SACRAMENTO BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Californians of every religion, including people who oppose abortion, believe 
that a Catholic bishop was out of line when he barred a San Diego assemblywoman 
from receiving Communion because of her pro-choice stand, The Times Poll has 
found. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the assemblywoman, Democrat Lucy Killea, went on to score an 
upset victory in a state Senate race tends to substantiate another point 
illustrated by the poll: It helps when running for elective office in 
California to be pro-choice on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Most Californians generally favor abortion personally, the survey showed. This 
places them in disagreement with Americans as a whole, who basically oppose 
abortion, according to a nationwide survey conducted by The Times last March. 
</P>
<P>
The latest state poll involved telephone interviews with 2,046 adults -- 1,594 
of them registered voters -- over a five-day period ending Wednesday night. The 
margin of error is three percentage points in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
"Although religion has always played an important part in American politics, 
this survey reaffirms that a majority of voters are likely to resent attempts 
by the church to influence the outcome of political contests," Times Poll 
Director I. A. Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
On other issues, the survey found that: 
</P>
<P>
* The ballot measure pushed by Gov. George Deukmejian and the Legislature to 
raise gasoline taxes in order to finance highway construction and improvements 
still is in trouble with the voters, although support has increased since two 
October surveys by The Times Poll. In this latest survey, 36% favored the 
proposal and 42% opposed it, with 22% expressing no opinion. In early October, 
only 29% favored the measure and 53% were opposed. 
</P>
<P>
* State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp is running 10 points ahead of former San 
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein in early jockeying for the 1990 Democratic 
gubernatorial nomination, 35% to 25% with 40% undecided. This is virtually the 
same standing as The Times Poll found in an October survey, when Van de Kamp 
held a 12-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
* A hypothetical November runoff between Van de Kamp and Sen. Pete Wilson, the 
expected Republican gubernatorial nominee, now is dead even among registered 
voters, with each getting 33%. This marks no change from the October poll, when 
each had 34%. In a Wilson-Feinstein match-up, the GOP senator holds a 20-point 
lead, 45% to 25%. That is a widening of the gap since October when the 
candidates were 14 points apart. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Assemblywoman Killea's stunning triumph in a Republican-dominated 
Senate district last Tuesday was viewed in both political and religious circles 
as a backlash against Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher's widely publicized, 
harshly worded sanction against Killea. Although personally opposed to 
abortion, Killea advocates the pro-choice position of allowing each woman to 
decide for herself whether to have an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"If the bishop had stayed out of it, I would have won," complained Killea's 
bitter opponent, GOP Assemblywoman Carol Bentley. The Times Poll had no way of 
proving her contention, since this was a statewide survey. But it did show that 
Californians as a whole consider the bishop's dramatic step in denying 
Communion to the candidate to be an unwarranted intrusion into politics. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether they regarded the bishop's action as "appropriate or not," 71% of 
the voters branded it inappropriate, including 70% of the Protestants and 71% 
of the Catholics. Only 21% felt it was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Even a majority of voters who generally oppose abortion believed that the 
bishop was out of line, by 52% to 34%. 
</P>
<P>
The survey reaffirmed that Californians are much more tolerant about abortion 
than are Americans generally. The Californians were asked whether they find 
themselves "more in favor of abortion or more opposed," and the response was 
54% in favor, 36% opposed and 10% not sure. By contrast, a national poll by The 
Times last March found Americans as a whole to be opposed to abortion, 40% to 
34%. 
</P>
<P>
Among California Catholics, there is a significant difference between voters 
and non-voters in their attitudes toward abortion. Catholics who are registered 
to vote favor abortion by a 5-4 ratio, but those who are not registered oppose 
it by 7 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
Latinos overwhelmingly oppose abortion, by a ratio of 9 to 5. But their impact 
in the voting booth is disproportionately low because less than half -- only 
44%, according to this survey -- are registered to vote. By contrast, 76% of 
all other racial and ethnic groups are registered. And these groups favor 
abortion by 7 to 4. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the higher people stand on the socioeconomic ladder the more they 
support abortion. 
</P>
<P>
All these factors contribute to a political climate that tends to reward 
candidates who are pro-choice. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate the point, The Times Poll asked voters to choose between two 
mythical candidates for governor, a "Mr. A" and a "Mr. B." The survey sample 
was divided, with the candidates' abortion positions -- whether pro-choice or 
anti-abortion -- reversed for two voter groups. The result was that whichever 
candidate was described as pro-choice emerged as a lopsided winner. 
</P>
<P>
Voters also were asked whether the abortion issue alone would cause them to 
abandon a candidate whom they normally would support except for the candidate's 
position on abortion. The responses showed that anti-abortion voters tend to be 
slightly more committed to their cause than are pro-choice voters. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion voters, the survey showed, are somewhat more apt to desert a 
pro-choice candidate than pro-choice voters are to abandon an anti-abortion 
contender. But because there are significantly more voters who favor the right 
to abortion than oppose it, a candidate who takes a pro-choice position can 
count on gaining more votes than he loses, roughly two points worth. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, voters were asked about their attitudes toward some candidate who 
might take a position "very different" from their own "on a sensitive issue," 
but promised to "uphold the present law" rather than "impose his views on 
others." Would the voter hesitate to support such a candidate or would the 
promise to uphold the law be sufficient? 
</P>
<P>
This is more than just a hypothetical question in the 1990 gubernatorial race, 
because Van de Kamp personally opposes capital punishment but says he would 
carry out the law and allow murderers to be executed. As a Catholic, he also 
personally opposes abortion, but is pro-choice. 
</P>
<P>
Voters were closely divided on the question in this survey, with 46% saying 
they would hesitate to vote for the candidate, 41% saying the "uphold the law" 
vow would be sufficient and 13% not sure what they would do. 
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that relatively few voters are paying any attention to the 
budding races for lesser state offices, such as lieutenant governor, attorney 
general and treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
In the contest for the Democratic attorney general nomination, the poll showed, 
Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner holds a 10-point lead over San Francisco 
Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith, but 66% had no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
State Sens. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) and John Seymour (R-Anaheim) are 
running virtually even for the GOP lieutenant governor nomination, with a 
whopping 87% holding no view on the contest. Abortion could become an issue in 
that race since Seymour's surprise announcement in September that he had 
reversed his position and is now pro-choice. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, State Treasurer Thomas Hayes and former U.S. Treasurer Angela (Bay) 
Buchanan of Irvine are running even in their bids for the GOP treasurer 
nomination, but 68% have no opinion. 
</P>
<P>

SALVATION ARMY TROOPS LAUNCH WINTER MARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The generals in charge of the campaign met quietly last September to begin 
mapping a strategy that would mean victory for one of the most dogged, most 
crafty armies ever. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was fairly simple: disperse soldiers throughout the landscape, disarm 
the populace with righteousness and press the advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The weapons: a bell, a bucket and 98 years of know-how. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Salvation Army, Orange County chapter, once again began its long 
winter march, a drive to make the holiday season a little brighter for the 
needy and the down-and-out. 
</P>
<P>
But what may go unnoticed by the casual sidewalk observer is the tactical 
planning and preparation that makes this and other divisions of the army among 
the most successful of holiday fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
Contributions in Orange County are up from 40% to 50% over last year so far, 
said Warren Johnson, business administrator for the army and an architect of 
the local campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The sincere "God Bless" and hearty shake of the bell may seem obvious, but 
there is a method behind that well-chosen phrase, the location of the soldier, 
even the shape of the collection bucket. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to collecting money for charity, the "Sally" is no neophyte. 
While the annual holiday kettle drive may lack the precision of a true military 
strike, nearly all of its components are conceived with a purpose: to persuade 
that self-absorbed, in-a-hurry, none-too-rich holiday shopper -- yes, you -- to 
hand over a buck or five. 
</P>
<P>
"We've tried to (staff) more kettles with army personnel, and that has been a 
positive approach for us," Johnson said. "And we have paid more attention to 
when and where we should have people standing out there. On a couple of 
occasions we had people at locations where the take was dismal." 
</P>
<P>
The best spots in Orange County to pick up more than a little spare change? 
Costa Mesa's South Coast Plaza (the east mall anchored by May Co. and Sears), 
Newport Beach's Fashion Island, the Roger's Gardens entrance at Santa Ana's 
MainPlace and Target stores at various locations throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
Upscale South Coast Plaza and Fashion Island may seem like predictable choices 
but not for the reason many might suspect, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for foot traffic -- not areas where somebody will drive up in a 
Mercedes and drop in a $50 bill," he said. "We're as excited about the dollar 
bills and quarters as the $50 bills. Exclusivity doesn't cross our minds." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, malls such as the Galleria in Glendale and Del Amo 
Fashion Square in Torrance do well, as do Target stores and Vons grocery 
stores, said Tara Patty, an army spokeswoman in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Even at the best sites, the army's foot soldiers are not posted haphazardly. At 
the peak of the kettle campaign, just before Christmas, there will be eight 
kettle locations at South Coast Plaza, chosen because they have a history of 
bringing in big money. 
</P>
<P>
"We maintain on a daily basis a record of the income of a kettle so we can 
check on any given day what it is pulling in versus last year or five years 
ago," Johnson said with the intentness of an accountant. 
</P>
<P>
"I can go back and tell you the effect that a rainy day had on a particular 
kettle five years ago. We know this." 
</P>
<P>
Despite an annual Christmas-season effort that pulls in a staggering $110 
million, the 124-year-old organization headquartered in Verona, N.J., maintains 
that it is not a fund-raising machine. 
</P>
<P>
Its success in that area is only a reflection of the tremendous need for its 
services, say its officers. 
</P>
<P>
But the task has been greatly aided through a mixture of acquired institutional 
shrewdness and individual enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 20,000 Salvation Army centers located in 83 countries. Army 
officials estimate there will be some 15,000 kettles in operation in the Unites 
States during this holiday season, manned by nearly 1 million volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
While there is some standardization among the various corps, much of the 
fund-raising strategy is left to individual divisions. 
</P>
<P>
"That is because the army corps officer ministers to that area in the same way 
any clergy would," said Gene Phillips, assistant director of national 
communications. "They know the area like the back of their hand. They know the 
best placements.." 
</P>
<P>
The army must also be sensitive to needs of the stores and businesses where it 
positions its soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say they are concerned with a troubling trend in recent years of 
malls severely restricting the access of army bell ringers or refusing them 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about one in five shopping malls in the country will ban 
kettles this Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
Some mall owners argue that if they allow the army entree they will be forced 
to let in other organizations as well. To counter those concerns, many corps 
are now offering options other than the traditional bell and bucket. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego divisions, for example, offer stores a package to choose from: a 
gift-wrapping booth at which shoppers can make donations, a brass band, 
strolling carolers or an information booth. 
</P>
<P>
At some locations bell ringing is a no-no, said Bob Bearchell, a spokesman in 
the army's western regional headquarters in Palos Verdes. In those cases, a 
sign reading "ding-dong" placed conspicuously has done almost as well. 
</P>
<P>
A popular trend in many communities (apparently more than just Southern 
California) is to have celebrity bell ringers come out for a stand. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest lure remains live music, Bearchell said. A Salvation Army band 
playing Christmas carols and hymns is a prized commodity, nationwide. If it can 
be paired with a children's chorus, an enterprising corps is almost assured a 
big payday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such enduring traditions, the army is not without its innovations. Some 
divisions mount campaigns that feature "the world's biggest kettle." Kettles as 
large as seven feet across and five feet deep have been made for such 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Big kettles make a lot of sense, Bearchell added. Mall space, especially during 
Christmas, is at a premium. With anxious shoppers in a last-minute frenzy, the 
crowds in front of a kettle can be daunting. People have been known to drop 
coins and fluttering bills into large kettles from the second or third level of 
a mall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even the small, traditional red kettles have changed since the first caldron 
was set up at an Oakland ferry landing in 1891. Undermanned army corps can now 
get kettles with such devices as a self-ringing bell and a booth complete with 
a public address system over which recorded music is played. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the slit in the kettle, through which bills and coins must 
pass. It's a little bigger these days and the lid now features a gentle 
downward slope. Such design variations are a result of watching people and how 
they give, said Maj. William Nottle, the army's Orange County coordinator.

"People like to be anonymous and unnoticed when they are giving money," Nottle 
said. "They like to walk up quickly (to a kettle) and be gone without any 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
The wider slit makes it easier to put money in without a lot of fiddling. 
</P>
<P>
The bell ringers themselves do not come through the fires of a kettle campaign 
without developing a few tricks of their own. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Rafael Joya Campos, an 83-year-old Santa Ana grandfather and 
veteran bell ringer of eight years, never heads to his post without a worn 
wooden ruler, which he uses to tamp down the bills in his kettle. A pot that 
appears overcrowded is to be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, is knowledge that can't be taught in schools, said Nottle, not 
all of it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
At the army's Palos Verdes training school, cadets are required to attend a 
seminar in Christmas field training, which explores various aspects of caroling 
and kettling. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, it's very practical, said field training officer Capt. Linda 
Markiewicz. 
</P>
<P>
"We teach them how to deal with stores and malls," she said, " . . . to try and 
stick by the Christmas shopping crowds and grocery stores. Some areas we seldom 
use. Like setting up in front of a liquor store would not be traditional." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, if any corps or soldier runs into a snag, they need only turn to the 
"Christmas brief," Markiewicz said. 
</P>
<P>
Like ancient scribes, Salvation Army personnel all over the world are 
instructed to keep detailed accounts of kettle campaigns for those who follow. 
</P>
<P>
"It is why there has been so much consistency in our programs," Markiewicz 
said. "We follow the same patterns." 
</P>

FEARS OF INSECT INVASION COME TRUE FOR NEIGHBORS

<P>
Laura Miyoshi had been chatting with neighbors just two nights ago about the 
possibility that a Mediterranean fruit fly could make its way to their block. 
</P>
<P>
They were worried that if a fly were found, the whole area could be infested, 
putting their back yard lemon, peach and orange trees in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Miyoshi found out her fears were warranted. County agriculture 
officials announced that they had discovered a infertile female fruit fly in 
Miyoshi's middle-class neighborhood, near the intersection of Garden Grove 
Boulevard and Edwards Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood is 10 miles south of where the only other Medfly has been 
found in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked," said Miyoshi, 29. "We were all concerned about our fruit." 
</P>
<P>
Miyoshi's concern reflected the reactions of neighboring residents, many of 
whom thought that the fly wouldn't travel as far south as Westminster. But most 
were in favor of eradication efforts, including the possibility that malathion 
pesticide spraying would begin in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural officials for now haven't announced spraying for the area, opting 
instead to wait and see if any more flies are found. Some residents were 
resigned to accept the spraying, even if it might be a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we'll have to have it," Judy Saylor, 42, said. "I'm not opposed to it. 
We have to save our crops. But it's going to be a mess. We're going to have to 
cover our cars and all our lawn furniture." 
</P>
<P>
Other residents said the impact of spraying wouldn't be any different than what 
they breathe every day. The first priority, they said, should be to destroy the 
fly. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, if gets rid of them, it's worth it," said Ron Riquier, 28. "Some people 
say it's going to give us cancer. Hey, they say bubble gum gives you cancer." 
</P>
<P>
But Marjorie Custer, 64, was worried about what the spraying would do to her 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"What are we going to do about our cars?" Custer said. "Good God! we'd have to 
get something for our (trailer) and everything." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Collamore, 76, said she blames people who bring in fruit from out of 
state for spreading the pest. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where they're coming from -- from out of state," she said. "Some stupid 
people." 
</P>
<P>
County agriculture officials were in the neighborhood Friday setting new traps 
and checking old ones. Among them was Denis Whitfill, the county agriculture 
employee who, while making a routine check in Brea last month, found a pregnant 
fruit fly in a trap in a guava tree. 
</P>
<P>
Whitfill, now working 60 hours a week, slowly drove down the street in an 
orange pickup truck, looking for trees with nearly ripe fruit. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just been checking extra carefully," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Whitfill hung one of his triangular shaped traps on a lemon tree in Adolph 
Halbjorhus' lawn. Halbjorhus was willing to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
"A person would almost have to cooperate if they are going to do any good," 
Halbjorhus said. "And those Medflies, I understand they can be pretty bad." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Halbjorhus, another resident wasn't too happy about being in Orange 
County at all. William Ukasick, 21, said that he's had plans to move out of 
state, and with this news, he said he was even more happy about his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm moving back to Wisconsin where we don't get this sort of thing," Ukasick 
said.

$50,000 GRANT GIVES FRESH LIFE TO MARSHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Coastal Conservancy on Friday approved a $50,000 grant for studies 
aimed at developing a long-range plan for preserving the San Joaquin Marsh, one 
of a handful of freshwater wetlands remaining in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The grant will be matched by $50,000 from the city of Irvine and $25,000 from 
UC Irvine, which owns 202 acres of the 588-acre marshland next to San Diego 
Creek in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"We are of course very excited about the approval," conservancy project manager 
Lisa Ames said. "We are hoping to get started with the studies and plans as 
soon as possible, and begin implementing actions in the next few months." 
</P>
<P>
Heightened concern about the fate of the marshland was precipitated by a recent 
decision to ban duck hunters from the area. 
</P>
<P>
For years, both UC Irvine and the Irvine Co. leased sections of the wetlands to 
hunting clubs, which in turn spent thousands of dollars each year to maintain 
the marshland and flood its ponds, allowing vegetation and wildlife to thrive. 
</P>
<P>
But, under pressure from animal welfare activists and residents concerned about 
the close proximity of hunting, the city of Irvine decided not to renew the 
hunting permits. UC Irvine officials followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
"It left the university in the position of feeling that it would be in the 
community's interest that we eliminate hunting on our land as well," said 
William Bretz, manager of UC Irvine's reserve land. 
</P>
<P>
The city voted to cover the water bill for two years or until a long-term 
solution could be found. But UC Irvine officials have been unable to foot their 
portion of the water replacement costs, estimated at about $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Bretz said the marsh has suffered this year, with fewer acres of 
waterfowl nesting and feeding habitat. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to functioning as a wetlands area, the reserve is one of the few 
remaining freshwater marshes along the Pacific Flyway and a stopping place for 
migratory waterfowl. The marsh is also home to about 200 species of wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Before approving the grant, board members of the Coastal Conservancy, a state 
agency engaged in coastal restoration, development of urban waterfronts and 
agricultural preservation, toured the marsh area Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co., which owns 300 acres of the wetlands, is expected to deed to 
the city its portion. The UC Irvine land is part of a statewide network of 
wildlife areas managed by the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
The area is surrounded by Michelson Drive, MacArthur Boulevard, Carlson Avenue 
and the San Diego Creek Channel. Although the Irvine Co. will release its 
ownership of the marsh, the company plans to spend more than $2.5 million in 
the next year for upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to begin by the next year or the middle of the year on various upkeep 
projects," Irvine Co. spokeswoman Kathleen Campini said. "We have plans that 
include making sure that material is removed out the wetlands, that there is an 
adequate water supply and that there be a viable drainage system in the area."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;

MOBILE HOME PARK RESIDENTS SPEAK OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 150 mobile home residents packed the council chambers this week to 
lobby for ordinances to protect their parks from high rent increases and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is part of the city's yearlong effort to merge the South Laguna 
Specific Plan into Laguna Beach's existing master plan for land use. The City 
Council will act on the recommended changes at a Dec. 12 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel we've heard every issue," said Planning Commission Chairman Norm 
Grossman. "Everyone has had a chance to give their opinions." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed change in zoning for Treasure Island and Laguna Terrace, the two 
mobile home parks in South Laguna, would prevent development of condominiums or 
other non-mobile home uses without another zoning change. 
</P>
<P>
Thurston Trailer Park, the other mobile home park in Laguna Beach, will be 
included in the ordinances later, Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
Treasure Island Mobile Home Park, a 27-acre parcel overlooking the ocean in 
South Laguna, is currently zoned for various non-mobile home uses, including 
time shares. The zoning in the other two parks would also allow the land to be 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
In response to pleas from trailer park residents, the Planning Commission 
previously voted to recommend a six-month moratorium on rent increases and a 
one-year moratorium on development. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't just a home we might be losing, it's a family," said Oliver Springer, 
a retired fireman and one of many residents who fear being forced out of their 
homes so that the park can be developed. "We're not rich. . . . People are 
living in fear." 
</P>
<P>
Treasure Island residents have been meeting for more than a year with Treasure 
Island Associates, which purchased the property in August for $43 million, an 
amount residents say they were willing to pay to purchase the property. LESLIE

STOP SIGNS VOTED TO DETER COMMUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has decided to add stop signs at two more residential 
intersections to discourage commuters from using the neighborhood as a 
shortcut. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the council approved 23 stop signs in another neighborhood plagued 
with commuter traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The stop signs are meant to make the residential streets less attractive to 
motorists trying to find the fastest way to work and home. 
</P>
<P>
The stop signs will go up in about two weeks at the intersections of Las Palmas 
Drive at Coronado Drive and on Hermosa Drive at Santa Maria Avenue, city 
traffic engineer Paul Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Although an independent traffic engineer had recommended further measures, such 
as making Lakeview Drive a one-way street, the council rejected that idea. Most 
residents were opposed to the change. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided, however, to have the city Transportation and Circulation 
Commission study blocking off Lakeview at the city's border with La Habra to 
discourage Imperial Highway traffic from using Lakeview as a shortcut. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Younker, who lives south of Lakeview on Terraza Place, submitted a 
petition signed by 140 area residents asking for the closure. TOM McQUEENEY

Two La Habra businesses have become the latest to join a partnership to help 
support local schools. Leisure Manor and Landmark Bank have "adopted" the 
Walnut and El Cerritos schools, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Awards were presented to representatives from each business by the Board of 
Trustees for the La Habra City School District earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
Walnut School Principal Pat Miller thanked the retirement home for its support. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us that they would like to host a party for us on Halloween, so we 
had a party at the Manor," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other joint efforts have included a poster contest and visits to the school 
each week by eight volunteers from Leisure Manor. 
</P>
<P>
Among support activities provided to El Cerritos School by Landmark Bank are 
coloring books and crayons promoting Halloween safety, a supply of candy for 
monthly assemblies, balloons for student of the month awards and the 
presentation of a Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
"We never had (a tree) at El Cerritos. It's in the cafeteria, and we're ready 
to decorate it. It's just gorgeous," said El Cerritos Principal Myrna Close. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Rau, senior bank vice president, said plans for additional support include 
volunteer work at the school, hosting luncheons for teachers and providing 
funds for special projects. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Morrison Clements expressed delight that local businesses have 
offered to help improve the quality of education for young students. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a relationship between the kids in the school and activities in the 
community," he said. DAVID F. BURKE

TRUSTEES PRESSED TO REOPEN SCHOOL

<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned about the growing student population, parents and teachers urged the 
Westminster School District's Board of Trustees to reopen one of five schools 
closed when enrollment declined. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 people attended the Thursday night hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the speakers objected to an alternative plan to change an existing 
junior high to a middle school. They also opposed adding portable classrooms to 
existing school sites. 
</P>
<P>
"If the sixth-graders are forced to go to a middle school, I'll work a second 
job and my husband will work a second job to pay to send our child to a private 
school," said Cynthia Torres, mother of a first-grader. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers Assn. director Richard Snyder also urged the board to reopen a school. 
</P>
<P>
"Those schools were paid for by citizens and that's what they're there for," he 
said."It would be foolish for the district to overlook that option." 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said portable classrooms would create crowding in the cafeteria, media 
center and computer room. 
</P>
<P>
The district's elementary schools are filled to capacity with an additional 400 
students expected next year. GREG HERNANDEZ

COUNCIL APPROVES CONSTRUCTION PLANS

Despite dozens of letters opposing the relocation of the Newport Pier's public 
restrooms, the City Council has approved plans to construct new restrooms and 
remodel the lifeguard headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the construction, scheduled to begin within a month, fear that 
relocating the restrooms from one side of the pier to the other will block the 
views of houses and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The construction is the first step in an $8-million project to upgrade Cannery 
Village and McFadden Plaza, according to City Manager Robert L. Wynn. Residents 
on the east side of the pier generally oppose relocating the restrooms to their 
side, while those on the west, where the restrooms now stand, endorse it, Wynn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But, Wynn said, "there will be a minimal impact on any of the views." 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the lifeguard headquarters include adding 926 square feet of space, 
constructing a ramp for the handicapped and remodeling the floor. 
</P>
<P>
The entire project is estimated to cost $870,671. MARCI HANOVER

ALLIGATOR IN VAN GIVES OFFICER A SHOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a suspicious-looking vehicle all right -- especially the live alligator 
riding in the back. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach Police Sgt. Chuck Olmstead did not realize the gator was alive 
until he shined his flashlight into the back of the van, and it did sort of a 
"Michael Jackson shuffle" to get out of the way, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Olmstead had taken a peek in the van that was parked outside the Arches 
Restaurant and Liquor Store on Pacific Coast Highway near Old Newport Boulevard 
on Wednesday night because it looked a little suspicious -- kind of a police 
officer's intuition. 
</P>
<P>
But the mystery was resolved a short time later, when up walked the van's 
owner, Monte Krizan, a herpetologist from Bloomington, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Krizan proceed to introduce the officers to Albert the alligator, a 6-foot, 
230-pound gentle brute of a lizard who is "very passive," Newport Beach police 
spokesman Sgt. Andy Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
And underneath the platform in the van, Krizan showed them Albert's traveling 
companion, an 18-foot snake. 
</P>
<P>
Just vacationing, Krizan explained. And after the police officers had their 
pictures snapped posing with the alligator, Krizan was on his way.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; 
</P>
<P>
PANEL SAYS SCHOOL SHOULD BE CLOSED 
</P>

Faced with declining enrollment, a committee formed by the Fountain Valley 
School District has recommended that at least one more campus be closed by the 
end of the school year, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In a detailed report, the committee argued that Fountain Valley Elementary 
School, the district's oldest elementary school, should be closed in June and 
its students divided among three other schools. The recommendation was 
presented by the special panel Thursday night. District trustees are expected 
to vote on the matter in January, after a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The elementary school was targeted for closure last year because it had the 
lowest enrollment in the district. But under pressure from disgruntled parents, 
trustees opted to close another elementary school instead. 
</P>
<P>
Seven schools have been closed since 1979 because of dwindling enrollment. 
Experts blame soaring home prices that have kept young families out. The 
average price of a single-family home in the Fountain Valley area is more than 
$220,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The price range for homes here is really out of reach for the younger family," 
said Cheryl Norton, a member of the committee and senior manager with the 
district. "The community is aging and the children in the neighborhoods are all 
grown up." 
</P>
<P>
The district, which serves most of Fountain Valley and part of northeastern 
Huntington Beach, was one of the fastest-growing school systems in Orange 
County 20 years ago. Families with young children were moving in as fast as 
housing tracts in the two cities could be built. 
</P>
<P>
But since 1973, when enrollment peaked at just over 12,000 students and 19 
schools, the district has experienced a continuous decline. There are now about 
5,000 students and 12 schools. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very discouraging for the district to have this happen," said Roger 
Belgen, a 17-year member of the school board. "We started out with a variety of 
neighborhood schools to give that close-knit feeling. We're losing that element 
now because we are losing the children." 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley is the only city in 
Orange County experiencing significant drops in enrollment. Officials expect 
that trend to continue until 1992, when the number of students entering 
kindergarten is expected to equal the number of students graduating from high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Although a decision on the school-closure recommendation isn't expected for a 
few weeks, trustees are bracing for protests from parents of the school's 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"We dealt with it last year, and then their complaint was that our projections 
of declining enrollment were wrong," Norton said. "So we waited a year to see 
if things changed, and they haven't. So we are back to our original 
suggestion." ALLISON SAMUELS

CREDIT FOR MOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article about the football player in Massachusetts who wanted his mom to 
attend the father-son banquet (Sports, Dec. 5) has prompted me to write. 
</P>
<P>
As a Mission Viejo mother of three sons who participated in sports from Little 
League through some professional ball, I felt a similar discrimination. We moms 
gave a lot of physical and emotional support to our sons and their athletic 
quests, but when it was time to take a bow, the fathers were the ones 
recognized. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't just the activities that we mothers were excluded from, however. When 
was the last time you, the Los Angeles Times, wrote about "Brett Johnson, son 
of Bob and Debbie Johnson of Mission Viejo"? 
</P>
<P>
There is one thing you can't take away from us, however. When those TV cameras 
turn on our sons, they always say, "Hi, Mom."

'MERIT-ONLY' COLLEGE ENTRY PROPOSAL FAILING; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: OPPOSITION BY JAPANESE-AMERICANS TO ADMISSION POLICY CHANGE 
FRUSTRATES GOP SPONSOR. REP. ROHRABACHER ISN'T GIVING UP THE FIGHT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A last-ditch attempt by Orange County Rep. Dana Rohrabacher to head off growing 
opposition to his plan to promote "merit-only" college admissions policies 
collapsed last week when a key California congressman rejected the second of 
two proposed compromises. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition of Asian-Americans to his proposals has surprised Rohrabacher, 
who says his intention is to correct an injustice suffered by that ethnic 
group. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute between Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), whose district includes 
northwestern Orange County, and Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento) highlights 
a renewed controversy over the use of affirmative action plans by colleges and 
universities to promote the admission of blacks, Latinos and other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
It also illustrates the political friction that sometimes is created when 
Republicans attempt to commandeer an issue -- racial discrimination -- that has 
been associated historically with Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"The Asian-American community is really up for grabs in terms of the two 
parties," said one Democrat, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Opposes Quotas 
</P>
<P>
A conservative Republican steeped in Libertarian political philosophy, 
Rohrabacher has said he strongly opposes schools' use of racial goals or quotas 
to admit minority candidates who do not meet academic standards established for 
the rest of the applicant pool. 
</P>
<P>
He contends that his position has been supported by a recent series of U.S. 
Supreme Court decisions that have narrowed the scope of affirmative action 
programs, especially those established by government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
But some Asian-American leaders and groups have sharply criticized 
Rohrabacher's attempt to put Congress on record against school policies that 
permit admission of more blacks and Latinos at the expense of Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rohrabacher proposal troubles me in two ways," said Matsui, who has 
emerged as the leader of congressional opposition. "It tends to exploit the 
Asian-American community . . . and it pits Asians against blacks and 
Hispanics." 
</P>
<P>
In the last two weeks, Matsui has turned down invitations by Rohrabacher to 
endorse an amended version of a Rohrabacher congressional resolution on the 
subject and to jointly call for a Department of Justice investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher, nonetheless, is pressing forward. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people who come from underprivileged groups in the United States who 
have trouble meeting the standards for admission to major universities. Proper 
affirmative action would be to try to educate them . . . in order to meet those 
standards," Rohrabacher said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not proper, however, to change standards for one group or the other . . 
. simply because of their race," he said. "And the problem is, Asian-Americans 
have been bearing the brunt of this." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, complaints have grown that highly qualified Asian-Americans 
have been denied admission to such schools as the University of California at 
Berkeley because school officials have reserved spaces for blacks and Latinos 
with lesser academic qualifications. Studies have shown that Asian-Americans 
tend as a group to score higher on achievement and other tests than other 
ethnic groups, including whites. 
</P>
<P>
In a resolution introduced in June in the House of Representatives, Rohrabacher 
called on the nation's universities to end admission policies that discriminate 
against Asian-Americans and asked the Justice Department to investigate 
institutions whose admissions policies appear to violate the law. 
</P>
<P>
In part, the resolution reads, " . . . it has been reported that many 
institutions of higher education have instituted admissions quotas designed to 
limit the admission of Asian-Americans. . . . These restrictive quotas are 
similar to those instituted in the 1920s to limit the admission of Jewish 
students." 
</P>
<P>
A congressional resolution puts Congress on record on an issue but does not 
carry the force of law. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent address to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Rohrabacher 
acknowledged that he has more in mind for the resolution than a redress of 
Asian-American grievances. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we can make sure people understand that quotas are un-American is to 
show that by using quotas, they affect in a very detrimental way a small group 
of Americans, Asian-Americans, who are struggling to improve their lot," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"So in a way, we want to help Asian-Americans, but at the same time we're using 
it (the resolution) as a vehicle to correct what we consider to be a societal 
mistake on the part of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher had signed up 73 co-sponsors, 27 of them Democrats, before Matsui's 
opposition surfaced early last month. Matsui said he was responding to concerns 
among members of the Asian-American community that Rohrabacher was attempting 
to use the issue for his own political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats Demur 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, seven Democrats have withdrawn their sponsorship. But 
Rohrabacher said they have been replaced by seven new Republican sponsors. The 
measure would require 218 votes for passage. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Matsui said he turned down the recent compromise 
offers because he does not believe that Rohrabacher's measure is the proper way 
to address the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't think a congressional resolution is the way to go because all it 
really does is heighten an issue in a way that doesn't produce anything," 
Matsui said. "What we're trying to do is work these things (admissions policy 
disputes) out on a case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
He cited an agreement on admission policies at UC Berkeley reached earlier this 
year after negotiations between school officials and community leaders as 
evidence that that approach is working. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Matsui rejected Rohrabacher's request to sponsor an amended 
version of the congressional resolution that would have conceded the legitimacy 
of affirmative action programs that do not violate the recent, restrictive 
Supreme Court decisions. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Matsui declined to co-sign a letter to U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh that asked the Department of Justice to investigate complaints of 
admissions discrimination at Boalt Hall, the law school at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Matsui, Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose) and other Democrats have drafted 
letters to Thornburgh and Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos asking for a 
report on the number of discrimination complaints they have received and the 
disposition of the investigations.

KEHRLI, LUCAS CARRY CORONA DEL MAR

<P>
Todd Kehrli, Corona del Mar High School's quarterback, accomplished quite a lot 
in the first half of the Sea Kings' Southern Section Division VI championship 
game against La Quinta Friday at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
He completed 10 of 14 passes for 159 yards, including a 49-yard touchdown pass 
to receiver Weston Johnson. The trouble was, that was all the scoring Corona 
del Mar could produce and the Sea Kings led by just four points at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Kehrli, a sophomore, accomplished much more just by turning and handing the 
ball to running back Brian Lucas on Corona del Mar's first play of the second 
half. Lucas ran 94 yards for a touchdown that lifted the Sea Kings' spirits and 
sent them on to a 21-10 victory in front of 7,500. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive Division VI championship for Corona del Mar 
(11-3). Last season, the Sea Kings defeated Valencia for the school's first 
football title. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta, which finished the season 9-5, was playing in it first championship 
game since losing to Saddleback in the 1985 Central Conference title game. 
</P>
<P>
"You know at the start of the season I thought (winning another title) was a 
possibility," said Corona del Mar Coach Dave Holland over a chorus of "Repeat, 
repeat." 
</P>
<P>
"We had those losses in league (to Estancia, Newport Harbor and Tustin), but I 
knew we would peak and the kids would get better," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar certainly peaked at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar's defense limited La Quinta to just one touchdown, a 10-yard 
pass from quarterback Richard Weaver to Trent Julian, and a 30-yard field goal 
by Matt Logan. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar also had two interceptions, including one by Mark Perlmutter 
that snuffed a fourth-quarter drive by La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs had the ball on the Sea King eight-yard line and Weaver, trying to 
run away from pressure, threw the ball right to Perlmutter. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised he threw it," Perlmutter said. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Takahashi, La Quinta coach, said the interception was the turning point. 
</P>
<P>
"We still had a chance," Takahashi said. "We needed two scores to win. We 
needed a touchdown and the two-point conversion and then a field goal." 
</P>
<P>
After Perlmutter's interception, La Quinta never got close to scoring again and 
Corona del Mar held on for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The offense really moved the ball in the second half," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest play was the long touchdown run by Lucas, who finished with 164 
yards in 20 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big play," Holland said. "There were a lot of big plays but that 
swung the momentum our way." 
</P>
<P>
Kehrli, who completed 11 of 17 for 159 yards and ran two yards for a 
third-quarter touchdown that gave Corona del Mar a 21-3 lead, had a good view 
of the play. 
</P>
<P>
"I just looked up and hoped he wouldn't get caught," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas broke through a huge hole over the left side of the Corona del Mar line, 
then cut outside and race untouched down the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
Until then La Quinta had clamped down on Corona del Mar's rushing game, forcing 
the Sea Kings to pass. In the first half, Lucas had gained five yards in seven 
carries and Jerrott Willard, the other running back, had three carries for 
minus-seven yards.

TRABUCO HILLS STOPS DRIVE, TOPS ORANGE

<P>
The end to 60 years of frustration was only a few inches away. However, Orange 
High School came up short again. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills survived a furious fourth-quarter drive to hold on for a 13-7 
victory in front of 7,200 in Santa Ana Stadium to win its second Southern 
Section Division VIII championship. But, for a few seconds, it appeared the 
Panthers were going to end their long drought. 
</P>
<P>
Orange has not won a Southern Section title since 1929. 
</P>
<P>
But with 54 seconds left, Orange had the ball on the Trabuco Hills 13-yard 
line. On fourth down, quarterback Chris Thompson floated a pass into the end 
zone to wide receiver Mark Kammerlohr, who had beaten defensive back Rick 
Sparks. 
</P>
<P>
Kammerlohr appeared to have the ball for a second, before it rolled off his 
fingertips, giving the Mustangs the ball and the title. 
</P>
<P>
"The play was executed well and I thought Mark was going to catch the ball," 
Orange Coach Tom Meiss said. "He made a nice cut, he just needed to be three 
inches taller. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably think of 150,000 plays between now and if I ever get back into a 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills (13-1) dusted off a relic to win the game, its defense. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the playoffs, the Mustangs' defense has merely filled in while the 
offense took a breather. But, when it was needed, it came to the forefront. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs kept the Panther offense out of the end zone. Orange's only 
touchdown came on an interception return. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills also forced three turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"We really needed a good defensive game tonight because we couldn't move the 
ball," Quarterback Tim Manning said. "That was the best defensive game we've 
played this year." 
</P>
<P>
Manning and the Mustangs haven't needed more than a token effort from the 
defense throughout the playoffs. In three previous postseason games, Trabuco 
Hills had outscored its opponents, 118-56. 
</P>
<P>
But Friday, the Panthers tied up the Mustang offense. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills (13-1) did gain 276 yards but scored only one touchdown. The 
Mustangs also got a pair of second-half field goals by Brent Roper. 
</P>
<P>
Roper, who has only five field goals on the season, made kicks of 30 and 32 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Orange confused Trabuco Hills with a variety of defenses. They sacked Manning 
three times and made him throw on the run several times. 
</P>
<P>
Manning completed 14 of 23 passes, but for only 131 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the toughest defense I've ever played against," Manning said. "I'm 
sore as hell." 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills was lucky to be tied, 7-7, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 7-0, Orange had the ball on the Trabuco Hills' 10. But Manning 
intercepted Chris Thompson's pass at the one and returned it 15 yards. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 23rd career interception for Manning, which tied him with David Hill 
of Mission Viejo as Orange County's all-time leader. 
</P>
<P>
"We got down there and I had to go into a spread offense, because our fullback 
(Paul Minor) was tired and I took him out the game," Meiss said. "If we would 
have scored there and gone up by 14 points, it would have changed the game 
completely." 
</P>
<P>
After the interception, Manning drove the Mustangs 84 yards for the tying 
score. He six of eight passes on the drive, including a nine-yard touchdown 
pass to Julian Ford with 52 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs made numerous mistakes through most of half. They turned the ball 
over twice and had 47 yards in penalties. 
</P>
<P>
It was also Manning's mistake that gave the Panthers their touchdown. On a 
second down play from the Mustang 17, Manning tried to hit Ford with a short 
pass. However, Jeff Peterson stepped in front of Ford for the interception, 
which he returned 25 yards for a touchdown.

Servite High School used a powerful inside game to defeat Valencia, 45-36, 
Friday in the championship game of the 27th Valencia basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia tried to counter Servite's inside game with a two-guard outside 
combination of Jason Bae and Richard Tibbie. 
</P>
<P>
But Steve Marusich, a 6-foot-6, 195-pound post player, and Blaine Patriquin, a 
6-4 230-pound power forward, combined for 27 points to lead the Friars. 
</P>
<P>
"We got it inside to Marusich and Patriquin in the second and they went to 
work," said first-year Servite Coach Richard Smith. "That was that." 
</P>
<P>
Said Valencia Coach Ray Rodriguez: "They just banged us inside." 
</P>
<P>
Valencia (3-2) stayed with Servite in the first half on the outside shooting of 
Bae. Only after Servite muscled its way out of a 18-18 halftime tie with a 6-0 
run at the start of the second half did Valencia's size disadvantage begin to 
become a glaring weakness. 
</P>
<P>
Servite (4-1) built an 11-point lead at 37-26, on free throw by Marc Lamb with 
6:09 remaining, but Valencia rallied with outside shooting. Tibbie, who 
accounted for 10 of the Tigers' 18 second-half points, led the Tigers in 
scoring with 19. Bae finished with 12, on four three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers got to within six points twice in the last 4:57 but could find no 
match for the inside game of Servite. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia trailed 37-31, after a three-point basket by Bae and two free throws 
by Tibbie after the Servite bench received a technical. Valencia trailed, 
39-33, after a basket by Tibbie with 2:53 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
But the Friars went back inside and led by 12 with 21 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to limit them to one shot and pound the ball inside," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
In other Valencia tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
El Modena 65, Katella 55 -- Katella trailed by only four with 2:51 remaining, 
but El Modena outscored Katella, 8-2, down the stretch in the third-place game. 
El Modena senior Jeff Leedom accounted for half his team's 18 points in the 
second quarter and scored 10 of the 17 points in the third quarter. He finished 
with 28, to lead all scorers. 
</P>

<P>
Loara High School hasn't played in the finals of a boys' basketball tournament 
in more than two decades, so Saxon Coach Jerry Halpin wasn't too worried when 
his team panicked in the third quarter Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
But the Saxons survived a third-quarter rally by Magnolia High School and 
escaped with a 69-52 victory in the championship game of the Garden Grove 
Tournament. It was their first tournament title since the mid-1960s, Halpin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Loara nearly let the game slip away after building a 37-18 lead with 5:04 left 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Magnolia trimmed the deficit to 54-44 with 4:17 left in the fourth period, but 
Tes Whitlock and Kareem Collins each scored four points in a 15-8 streak that 
sealed the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We fell apart," said Loara center Joey Gaudio, who finished with 17 points. 
"We thought we had it won in the third quarter and we let up." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Halpin wasn't too worried. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our semifinal game with Western on Wednesday night took a lot out of 
us," Halpin said. "But we've got this team playing hard and believing in 
themselves. And in high school sports, believing in yourself goes a lot further 
than talent." 
</P>
<P>
Magnolia Coach Al Walin said his team never should have given Loara the big 
lead. The Sentinels sank only five of their first 15 free-throws and had 14 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"We had such a lousy start that we couldn't get organized," Walin said. "The 
loss was our own fault. We didn't do things we wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
One of those things was stopping Whitlock, who finished with a game-high 18 
points and was named the tournament's most valuable player. He had eight points 
in the fourth quarter, when the Saxons pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
"Tes knows when to rest and when to turn it on," Halpin said. 
</P>
<P>
Robbie Hargis scored 13 points for Magnolia (3-2). 
</P>
<P>
The Saxons improved to 4-0 under Halpin, their first-year coach. They won only 
four games all last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really not surprised to be 4-0," Halpin said. "We were 12-6 during the 
summer leagues, but I don't think it really sank in how good this team was 
until we rallied from 19 down against Western in the semifinals." 
</P>
<P>
It sank in a little further on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
In consolation games of the Garden Grove tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Western 68, Buena Park 45 -- Sam Sabbara scored 35 points to lead the Pioneers 
in the third-place game. Richard Harvey led Buena Park with 12. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia 55, Laguna Hills 50 -- Augustin Heredia scored 19 points and Son Ly 
added 12 to lead the Eagles in the fifth-place game. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove 52, Bolsa Grande 51 -- Joe Aguirre's tip-in at the buzzer gave the 
Argonauts (1-2) the victory in the seventh-place game. Mark Perry led Garden 
Grove with 16 points and Aguirre added seven. Sherman Gorden led Bolsa Grande 
(1-3) with 13 points.

Lynwood High School's Ernest Killum put his personal punctuation marks on both 
ends of his team's semifinal game against Brea-Olinda in the Laguna Beach 
tournament Friday night, and he did it with his usual flair -- way above the 
rim. 
</P>
<P>
Killum accented the opening minute of the game with a swat. He batted away the 
first shot attempted by Brea-Olinda's Keith Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Then with 2:24 left, Killum jammed home a two-handed slam off an alley-oop pass 
from point guard Mike Singleton to snap a 53-53 tie. Lynwood (5-0) went on to a 
62-56 victory and will meet Compton at 7:30 tonight in the championship game at 
Laguna Beach High. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night's first half showcased the matchup of Lynwood's Killum, who 
finished with 17 points, and Brea-Olinda's Walker. After watching his first 
shot get blocked, Walker returned the challenge by swatting away a couple of 
Killum's shots. 
</P>
<P>
Then Walker and Killum put on a two-man slam duel. Walker's 360-degree reverse 
dunk off a steal might have been the best, but Killum's first-half jams 
featured another alley-oop from Singleton and a soaring tomahawk dunk over the 
head of Brea's Rodney Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Walker led all scorers with 27 points, including three three-pointers, but he 
wasn't enough to lift Brea (3-1). Brea's biggest points may have come on Jeff 
Roeser's only basket, a soft jump shot that tied the score with 2:55 left. 
</P>
<P>
Brea forged a comeback after Killum left the game with 11 points and four fouls 
with 6:38 left in the third quarter. When Killum went out, Lynwood had a 
comfortable 40-30 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Brea cut into that lead on a pair of inside baskets from center Fritz 
Wickman (eight points) and a key three-pointer by Walker. 
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal game: 
</P>
<P>
Compton 74, Laguna Beach 57 -- Laguna Beach cut Compton's lead to 46-42 at the 
start of the fourth quarter, but forward Dain Blanton scored 19 points and the 
Artists (5-1) fell apart in the final period. 
</P>
<P>
Compton (5-0) was led by sharpshooting guard Curtis Thomas, who had four 
three-pointers and led all scorers with 25 points. Compton also got solid 
inside play from center Darnell Patterson (15 points) and forward James 
Williams (14 points). 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth-place semifinal game: 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar 75, St. John Bosco 60 -- Doug Hesse scored 20 points and Mark 
Flint and John Paulsen each had 18 for Corona del Mar. Flint also had 11 
rebounds. Jon Upham had 14 for Corona del Mar.

Los Alamitos High School scored 13 consecutive points in the fourth quarter in 
a 62-61 victory over Mission Viejo in a Trabuco Hills tournament semifinal game 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado, like Los Alamitos from the Empire League, advanced to the 
championship game by beating Trabuco Hills, 82-78. The championship game is at 
8:15 tonight at Trabuco Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo (2-1) led Los Alamitos (3-0), 49-43, when Robert Conlisk scored. 
He was fouled on the play and his free throw narrowed the Diablos' lead to 
49-47. 
</P>
<P>
"That play was the game," Mission Viejo Coach Bob Minier said. He also cited 
Los Alamitos' fourth-quarter steals and his team's late-game fatigue as 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo's first basket of the fourth quarter, a Tom Merk field goal 
followed by a free throw, moved the Diablos to within five. Mark Wright's field 
goal in the final six seconds cut the Los Alamitos lead to three points. Then, 
Eric Cramer fouled Los Alamitos' Bryan Hakala on the inbound pass with five 
seconds to play. Hakala made the first, 62-58, but missed the second. Mission 
Viejo's Greg Amaya made a three-pointer before time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos Coach Steve Brooks said the keys to victory were "sealing off 
their rebounds and limiting them to one shot." 
</P>
<P>
In other Trabuco Hills tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado 82, Trabuco Hills 78 -- Jerome Facione made a pair of free throws 
with 10 seconds left to give El Dorado (4-0) a four-point lead. Facione scored 
15 points. El Dorado was led in scoring by guard Mike Bradach who scored 33 
points. Trabuco Hills led, 46-42, at the half but El Dorado outscored the 
Mustangs, 21-15, in the third quarter to take a 63-61 lead. Trabuco Hills plays 
Mission Viejo for third place today at 6:30. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill 91, University 69 -- Mark Wilkinson scored 24 of his 32 points in the 
third quarter to lead Foothill over University. 
</P>
<P>
University (1-3) trailing Foothill (1-3) by 10, penetrated the Knights' zone 
defense and got the ball to Klaus Perwas to pull to within two, 35-33, at 
halftime. Perwas scored 14 of his 23 points in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill switched to a man-to-man defense in the third quarter and held Perwas 
to nine points in the second half. University plays Fullerton today at 3 p.m. 
for seventh place. Foothill plays Rancho Buena Vista at 4:45 p.m. today for 
fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Buena Vista 85, Fullerton 82 -- Daryl Parker scored two free throws in 
the final 27 seconds to lead Rancho Buena Vista over Fullerton. Following 
Parker's free throws, Fullerton's Rene Arias was fouled before a three-point 
attempt in the final 18 seconds. He made the first but missed the second. Chris 
Rubal scored with five seconds remaining, but it was too little too late. Chris 
Hartshorn scored five of his 21 points for Fullerton on three-point plays.

FONTANA LIVES UP TO ITS BILLING, WINS TITLE 
</P>

<P>
Before the start of the high school football season, the consensus around 
Southern California was that Fontana High School had the best Division I team 
in the Southern Section. Now it's a fact. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana completed a 14-0 season with a 35-7 victory over Citrus Belt League 
rival San Gorgonio of San Bernardino Friday night before a crowd of 20,583 at 
Anaheim Stadium to win its second Division I championship in the last three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana won the title in 1987 when it defeated Capistrano Valley, 21-0. Over 
the last three seasons, the Steelers are 38-2. 
</P>
<P>
San Gorgonio, which only lost to the Steelers, 30-22, in the regular season, 
was overpowered by the Steelers and running back Samita Vaoifi, who ran for two 
touchdowns and passed for another. 
</P>
<P>
However, for the second consecutive week, Fontana did not dominate at the 
start. In their 48-35 victory over Edison of Huntington Beach in last week's 
semifinal, the Steelers fell behind by as many as 14 points twice in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Against San Gorgonio, the Steelers were charitable on the game's first play as 
Vaoifi fumbled the opening kickoff on Fontana's 30-yard line. Eight plays 
later, the Spartans scored when running back Ron Rivers went in from a yard out 
to give San Gorgonio a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike their game against Edison, the Steelers responded quickly with a 
nine-play, 73-yard touchdown drive of their own, which Vaoifi finished with a 
38-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week (against Edison) was a special game, but that only got us here," 
Bruich saind, "We had to play this one to win the title." 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 7-7, Fontana's defense forced the Spartans to punt deep 
from their own territory setting up the Steelers' second score. 
</P>
<P>
On a five-play, 30-yard drive, the Steelers went to the left throwing arm of 
Vaoifi, who threw a halfback option touchdown pass to Ron Austin to give 
Fontana a 14-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
San Gorgonio began the second half with a long drive deep into the Steelers' 
territory. Behind the running of Rivers, who gained 36 yards on the drive, the 
Spartans had a first down on Fontana's 30-yard line before quarterback Marcus 
McMaryion threw an interception to William Ephraim. 
</P>
<P>
After a clipping penalty on Emphraim's return, Fontana went on a nine-play, 
85-yard touchdown drive with the key play being a seldom-thrown 52-yard bomb 
from quarterback Nick Bennett to Austin. 
</P>
<P>
The pass caught the Spartans by surprise, as Bennett has averaged less than 40 
yards passing per game all season. This would be his only attempt of the game. 
Wingback Kenneth Cannon completed the drive with a 14-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana continued with its domination after Cannon's score, by not allowing San 
Gorgonio beyond midfield the rest of the game. The Steelers pressured McMaryion 
into completing only five of 11 passes for 36 yards with two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers extended their lead to 28-7 to begin the fourth quarter when 
Vaoifi finished off a nine-play, 44-yard drive with an eight-yard touchdown 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Fontana's last score came with 5:24 remaining in the game when fullback Robert 
Sylvester scored on a three-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
San Gorgonio, which finished 10-4, had only 129 total yards in offense, with 
Rivers getting 118 of those in 24 carries.

NEWPORT HOME BUILDER'S EARNINGS DIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Home builder J.M. Peters Co. Inc. reported sharply lower earnings Friday for 
its third quarter as the market for new homes in Southern California slowed 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a local stock analyst said a sale of the Newport Beach company could 
come as soon as the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Peters said earnings dropped to $5.7 million for the quarter ending Nov. 30, 
compared to $8.5 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
That has probably lowered the price of the company, which, according to Mark 
Matheson of the Newport Beach investment banker Cruttenden &amp; Co., is being 
courted by at least five possible buyers since being put up for sale with an 
investment banker in August. 
</P>
<P>
Matheson said the troubled Texas savings and loan association that owns most of 
the stock in the home-building company must raise cash to meet tougher new 
federal requirements on the thrift industry. 
</P>
<P>
That thrift, San Jacinto Savings Assn., is itself a subsidiary of Dallas' 
Southmark Corp., which is in bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Matheson said Peters is said to be pursued by three or four East Coast builders 
or developers seeking a foothold in the California market and one foreign 
bidder, possibly Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
Matheson was also strongly critical of what he said was the company's failure 
to inform shareholders on the progress of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Here's why: The 13% of Peters stock that is owned by the public has been 
falling since San Jacinto hired Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in August to sell 
Peters. 
</P>
<P>
The stock sold for nearly $14 then. Friday it traded at $8.50, down 25 cents 
for the day, and an impressive 67,000 shares changed hands after Peters 
announced its disappointing earnings. Investors are sour on the home-building 
industry, fearing a big downturn could flatten sales. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Peters may still fetch as much as $12 to $13 a share from a buyer who takes 
a longer view of the market and wants entree to California, Matheson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they do a disservice to shareholders who may not be aware the company 
could sell for that much," Matheson said. 
</P>
<P>
At $13 a share the company would cost about $180 million. 
</P>
<P>
A Peters spokesman said Friday that he can't comment on the identity of the 
bidders because San Jacinto and Shearson Lehman haven't told Peters anything. 
For the same reason, the home builder can't be blamed for not keeping 
shareholders informed, Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
"San Jacinto is the owner and they're the ones doing the marketing," said a 
Peters spokesman. "We're totally out of the loop." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the market is soft for the large, expensive homes that Peters 
builds. 
</P>
<P>
The type of people who can afford these houses -- usually people who already 
own a home and who use the equity from a sale to "trade up" to a Peters house 
-- aren't selling their houses as often this year. Hence, fewer customers for 
Peters' luxury homes. 
</P>
<P>
Peters said its revenues fell from $88.5 million in third-quarter 1988 to $70.4 
million this quarter. Buyers contracted for 84 new homes compared to 103 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of Peters' fiscal year, earnings dropped to $14.2 
million compared to $23 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Revenues fell to $188.2 million compared to $269.4 million last year.

INSURER TO CLOSE ORANGE OFFICE, LAY OFF 300 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing excessive employee turnover as a result of Orange County's tight labor 
market, Nationwide Insurance said Friday it has decided to close its Orange 
office by late 1990 and eliminate 300 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The company will transfer the operation to Visalia in the Central Valley. 
Employees will have to move or be laid off, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"High employee turnover rates make it difficult to maintain Nationwide's high 
customer service standards," Vice President Bill Lee said. "The move to an area 
with a more stable employment market will help us better serve policyholders." 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide also announced that it will move its Northern California office from 
Concord to Visalia in late 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The company will keep a local sales staff in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide Mutual -- the parent company of Nationwide Insurance -- is the 
nation's fourth-largest auto insurer in the United States.

FOR CHEERY GATHERING, KEEP FAMILY BUSY, SHARING

<P>
Your cousin Bob has vowed that if Uncle Eddie shows up this year and tries to 
sell him more life insurance, Eddie will never live to see New Year's. 
</P>
<P>
Your nephew Joey (he calls himself Mangler) is taking karate and can't wait to 
show everyone, Aunt Giselle is into the cooking sherry again, Mom and Dad have 
turned the martyrdom dial up to high because they'd really planned to be in 
Hawaii, your sister Moonbeam has become a vegetarian and is lecturing everyone 
on the evils of turkey flesh, your wife's sister's twins have just poured brown 
gravy into the VCR, your own children are afraid to come out from under the 
bed, and the creamed corn just exploded. 
</P>
<P>
The only silver lining you can find in all this is that Norman Rockwell didn't 
live to see it. 
</P>
<P>
Short of calling 911, how do you cope with the holiday family gathering that is 
a cinch to be far quirkier than the warm, loving, tolerant, traditional evening 
over at the Cratchits? What do you do when you're faced with the real world of 
modern family peccadilloes, jealousies, rivalries, squeamishness, avoidance, 
unfriendliness, nit-picking, discomfort and anxiety that sometimes go with the 
season? 
</P>
<P>
For starters, say Orange County psychologists, distract 'em. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to try to inject a little humor into the situation," said 
Tustin psychologist Alan Liberman, a marriage, family and child counselor. "I 
think anything that can be done that might be of a creative nature where you 
can provide humor, or have more than one activity going at a time, would help. 
The guests might bring white elephant gifts to exchange to warm things up, or 
you might even produce a little newsletter to catch people up on what has 
occurred during the year with different family members. 
</P>
<P>
"You can assign people to tasks during the gathering, too. Make someone 
responsible for games and activities, or for bringing different parts of the 
meal. That way people feel a part of things and don't feel so isolated. And, it 
takes the burden off the people giving the party." 
</P>
<P>
Jody Dean, a psychologist with practices in Mission Viejo and Fullerton, said 
activities such as movies or a visit to the park "will direct the attention 
away from conflict and onto the movie, or the kids playing, onto something that 
is pretty neutral and an undemanding situation. Sometimes adding a few people, 
friends for instance, can actually enhance things in that those people will 
give the guests something to focus on besides themselves." 
</P>
<P>
It is that self-focus that often is the culprit when family gatherings get 
tense, said Barbara Kreedman, a clinical psychologist with a practice in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"People have a problem with looking for approval during the holidays," she 
said, "and one of the psychological issues that they're dealing with is their 
need to separate themselves from the people that they're close to and at the 
same time wanting love from those people. They're wanting to be who they are, 
but they're looking for approval, too. They're looking for people who are like 
them or who feel like them, and sometimes the family members cannot provide 
that. There's what is called a narcissistic sameness that doesn't always exist 
among family members. That's where injuries and disappointments take place." 
</P>
<P>
The holiday season, Kreedman said, "increases the need for that narcissistic 
sameness. You look to your family at this time of year, and there's a need for 
family unity. Ideally, people have to realize that approval and validation 
can't always be there. Coming to grips with the limitations found in other 
family members will release the injury and depression that exists when people 
aren't getting their needs met. That's going into adulthood." 
</P>
<P>
It is possible, Liberman said, to defuse a family confrontation before it 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably a good idea when you invite everybody to let them know in a 
letter who is coming (to the party) so they can have a choice of whether to 
come," he said. "If people know they're going to be going to a place and 
someone is going to be there that they do not get along with, and certain 
activities are going to be going on, they can participate in one activity while 
the other person is doing something else. These gatherings are not the places 
to work out bad-blood situations." 
</P>
<P>
They also aren't the time to expect children to be on their best behavior. 
Children can become confused by all the activity, and bewildered by the 
behavior of adults. 
</P>
<P>
"It's harder for children to look to themselves and say, 'Gee, Mom's cooking 
all day and she's upset, but that has nothing to do with me. It would be 
wonderful if adults could convey that idea to a child. But if the adults are 
angry, children personalize that and sense that their parents have changed. 
They say to themselves, 'What have I done? Am I bad today?' " 
</P>
<P>
It's a mistake to expect resolutions to family conflicts during gatherings, 
Dean said, even during the season of good will toward men. 
</P>
<P>
"Especially around the holidays, when everyone's on edge, it's best that people 
not have expectations that they'll have Hallmark-greeting-card family 
gatherings," Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
"Families don't work that way. Even though it's Christmas Day, it's possible 
for it to turn out to be a pretty hellish afternoon. People shouldn't come into 
one of these gatherings with an agenda on their minds. You're not going to 
solve a 10-year-old problem with Mom and Dad."

ZESTY LATIN BEAT HAS NOT SO QUIETLY FOUND A POPULAR HOME IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
It's Saturday night and tucked away inside a small shopping center in Anaheim 
is the club J.C. Fandango's, where sultry "Iris de Colombia" has just stepped 
to the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
She greets her audience, and, as the Latin songbird for Orquesta Fuego, 
welcomes the more than 175 people to another night of salsa at the popular 
nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
Like the audience, many of whom are dressed to kill in skintight skirts for the 
women, and double-breasted suits for the men, Iris, whose real name is Iris 
Caisedo, is in something sexy, something purple. Her fellow lead singer, 
Antonio Bardales, sports a salmon-colored suit. 
</P>
<P>
After a fast-paced merengue, Iris tells the audience a salsa tune is next, as a 
chorus of whoops comes from small groups of people who yell, "alriiight!" 
Within seconds, drinks are put down, chairs empty, and the single men trot out 
to ask the single women to dance. In moments, the dance floor is a gyrating 
mass of people. 
</P>
<P>
One couple, Juan Ramon Chacon and his wife, Angelica, hurry to the dance floor. 
They pick their spot and as Juan lifts his wife's right hand and places his 
right hand on her waist, they let themselves go, getting caught up in the 
music. Two dances are sung, then a third, but by the fourth, which is a mambo, 
they decide to sit down. 
</P>
<P>
"I come here because I love the salsa. We've been to the L.A. nightspots," 
Chacon says, mentioning several popular nightclubs in Los Angeles County, 
including Cache in Glendale and Wings in Covina. "But we like Fandango's 
better. We come here almost every weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Chacon and his wife have joined thousands of others who are filling salsa clubs 
throughout Orange County. With little or no advertising, club owners have found 
that it's a booming business as hundreds of eager fans flock to the nightly 
salsa beat. 
</P>
<P>
Salsa, for those not familiar with the style, is a mix of the brash and bright 
urban music of Cuban and Puerto Rican New York City. 
</P>
<P>
One salsa fan, or salsero, as they call themselves, describes the music as a 
variety from South American countries: "Puerto Ricans have their guanguanco 
style, the Colombians their cumbias, Cuba brought the cha-cha and mambo to the 
United States and the Dominican Republic brought the hyper merengue. When you 
get them all together, you have a mix, a sauce zesty with tomatoes, onions and 
chilies and that's why it's called salsa. These different styles are under the 
big umbrella of salsa." 
</P>
<P>
For years, cities with substantial Latino populations have held salsa festivals 
in Miami, New York, and Los Angeles. Salsa in Orange County is considered in 
its infancy, said Rae Arroyo, host of a Tuesday night salsa show on radio 
station KSBR (88.5) that broadcasts from Saddleback College in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just touched the tip of the iceberg in Orange County," Arroyo said. 
"It's going to boom. Ten years ago, when my show started, there was absolutely 
nothing in the way of good salsa (in Orange County). People had to drive to Los 
Angeles. Now, there are many clubs providing great music." 
</P>
<P>
What touched off the salsa wave, she and others believe, is that as the Latino 
population grows in Orange County, it inevitably has had an impact on the style 
of entertainment. They also said that the movie "Salsa," which introduced the 
hot rhythm to non-Latinos, has had an impact. 
</P>
<P>
While popular mainstream Latin singers like Julio Iglesias, Jose Luis Rodriguez 
and others have been welcome in Orange County, a growth in popularity with 
Latin dance groups and singers has exploded with little fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
For example, on Thanksgiving Day, the Anaheim Convention Center, which can 
average 3,000 people on a Saturday night, had a lineup of no fewer than seven 
different groups primarily for a predominantly Mexican audience. 
</P>
<P>
With a $28 cover fee, it's become obvious to promoters and club managers that 
Latinos enjoy their entertainment in Orange County. And the market is growing, 
said Larry Robinson, Anaheim Convention Center box office manager. 
</P>
<P>
Just recently, two of the biggest names in salsa, Tito Puente, "El Rey de 
Tymbal," and Celia Cruz, a dominant Cuban singer, paid visits to Orange County. 
And Panamanians still remember the night several years ago that Ruben Blades, a 
30-year-old actor, singer, and songwriter from Panama, churned them into a 
frenzy at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
It is this international Latin flavor, along with a growing appreciation by 
non-Latinos, that has rocketed salsa to prominence, especially in Orange County 
where Latinos make up only 20% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
Where Mexican norteno bands, which usually headline at the Anaheim Convention 
Center, attract mostly Mexicans, salsa attracts a hip, urban, racially mixed 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of cowboy boots and jeans, salsa attracts the linen suit and knit skirt 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"People I see coming into the club are more sophisticated; they're in love with 
the music and they want to dance," said Jose Castellanes, Fandango's owner. 
</P>
<P>
Fandango's is regarded as the salsa club in Southern California by several 
Spanish-language television and radio programs. The club provides salsa six 
nights a week, and has brought such groups as Grupo Niche from Colombia, hot 
Puerto Rican bands, and others. 
</P>
<P>
Because "salsa is international," Castellanes has hung flags from South 
American countries above the dance floor in his Anaheim club and also has named 
the tiers that separate dinner guests from the dance crowd after South American 
countries to complement an array of ethnic dishes. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of the wide audience, Juan Chacon and his wife were born in 
Guatemala, while many of the other salsa dancers said they are from Puerto 
Rico, Costa Rica and Colombia. Few said they were from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends told me about this place. I've been to other dance clubs in Los 
Angeles but some of them are very small," said Jose Bayron, 29, a Puerto 
Rican-born assistant credit manager from Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Bayron's girlfriend, Veronica Cotter, said that although she is Anglo, she 
likes the music and is learning to dance salsa's upbeat rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, dancers Enrique Villasana, 20, and Gabriela Arreola, 18, are 
devoted salseros. Both are members of an informal Anaheim salsa club, where the 
men wear matching shirts and couples compete on the dance floor. Couples like 
Villasana, who works in a factory silk-screening T-shirts, and Arreola, a 
waitress, join other couples on the weekends and travel a salsa circuit that 
spills into both Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
At Ruckus Restaurant in Orange, where radio personality Rae Arroyo is a disc 
jockey on Friday and Saturday nights, there are no live bands. But the music, 
Arroyo claims, is "100% for salseros." 
</P>
<P>
"When I hired Rae, I knew she had a lot of talent and a big following," said 
Walter Serrano, Ruckus's co-owner. "She said 'OK,' when I asked her to work for 
me, but she wanted to have the only place in Orange County to hear authentic 
salsa music. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we're packed on the weekends and we don't even advertise," Serrano said.

DISCOVERY: GAL AFFAIRE: DRESSING CINDERELLA FOR THE BALL

<P>
Quick! It's the holiday season. There is a charity ball, the office party, a 
New Year's Eve affair and . . . they're all formal. What do you do? 
</P>
<P>
If there isn't a tuxedo already hanging in the closet, it's easy enough to walk 
into the nearest shop specializing in formal wear rentals and be ready in no 
time for 
</P>
<P>
maximum partying for minimum cash -- if you're a man. Women, however, face a 
different problem. It would be social suicide to be seen in the same dress 
three times in a row, but it could be a financial fiasco to do otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Gal Affaire in Los Alamitos can be a reasonable alternative to the faux pas of 
repetition or the certainty of bankruptcy. The shop has more than 500 designer 
formals, all personally scrutinized and individually selected by owner Pat 
Thomas. Gal Affaire has everything from chiffons to lace, silks to sequins and 
lame to beads in every color under the sun, including fiery reds, elegant 
blacks and plenty of glittery gold and silver. Too, there is an assortment of 
boas, furry jackets, jewelry, shoes and hats. 
</P>
<P>
"We get women who attend a lot of charity events, brides who don't have a 
fortune to spend or mothers looking for prom dresses for their daughters," says 
store manager Antwinette Guzzino. "Most of them can't see paying $1,000 for a 
dress to wear once and hang in the closet, so they come to us." 
</P>
<P>
"Our clothing has been everywhere," Guzzino explains. "We've been to the 
Academy Awards, the Country Music Awards, MTV Awards and even an (presidential) 
Inaugural Ball." 
</P>
<P>
That's a modest accounting. Women from all over the county have discovered the 
thriving business for their charity balls, class reunions, cruises and 
weddings. Even beauty pageant queens have been outfitted with gowns from Gal 
Affaire, including the reigning Miss Seal Beach, her first and second 
runners-up, and Simone Stephens, Miss California 1987-88, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
From $49 for a simple strapless cocktail dress, to $229 for a dazzling sequin 
gown, any woman can dress like a beauty queen for a special do. The shop 
carries sizes 4 to 24, and alterations are usually fairly simple and quick. 
</P>
<P>
"We can tailor a fit to just about anyone since all of our alterations are done 
by hand and are temporary," Guzzino explained as she watched a customer admire 
a velvet and sequin ensemble in the mirror. "In fact, I have one dress in here 
I've gotten everyone into from a 4 to a 14." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the special occasion, Orange County ladies know they don't need a 
fairy godmother to dress them.

In this season of heavy mailing, you are probably dreading a trip to the post 
office, where the lines are sure to be longer than those for fresh vegetables 
in Moscow. An alternative might be to try one of the more than 50 small, 
contract postal stations scattered throughout the county. (Unless noted, these 
stations are closed on Sundays.)

The Scene 
</P>
<P>
Get-together for members of the California Century Club, a support group for 
the Newport Harbor Art Museum, in the Big Canyon home of Dorothea and Peter 
Perrin. The C.C. Club -- "C cubed," its members call it -- consists of 100 
couples who pay $500-per-couple yearly dues to finance the museum's "New 
California Artist" exhibitions. The Wednesday night klatch served as the 
group's "official introduction" to Lucinda Barnes, Newport Harbor's new 
associate curator and the person responsible for selecting new California 
artists for the exhibition series. For a couple of after-dinner hours, the 50 
cubies shared wine and snacks and art talk with Barnes in the officially 
unpretentious manner of the group.

adorning the walls of his gigantic brand-new home. ("We're not really 
collectors," he repeatedly demurred.) Like the huge oil by Christopher Brown 
that dominates one wall in the living room. And the sculpture by fellow 
Canadian Sorel Troge (a friend, said transplanted Canadian Perrin, who's lived 
in Orange County for nine years). Troge's stark figure stands in its own 
lighted alcove just to the left of the front door. "Looks like we built the 
house for it, doesn't it?" Perrin asked.

Terri Coons and Doreen Alstrom studied the painting hanging above the Perrins' 
fireplace. "The fact is," said Alstrom, "I think most people would put a bigger 
(painting) in that space; they would try to fill the space, but everything is 
enhanced this way -- it adds drama, it creates an architectural feel. . . ." 
Nearby Larry and Leonora Treglia chatted with Doreen's husband, John Alstrom. 
"We have a modest collection," said Treglia, then putting his arm around his 
wife: "It's kept modest by a certain conservative member of the family. . . ." 
In the dining room, munching homemade hors d'oeuvres and desserts, new club 
member Jerry Werksman said he was only "moderately" fond of contemporary art, 
but he joined the museum group "because they have this combination of 
enthusiasm and sophistication that makes things happen."

Barnes showed up shortly before her very informal ("rambling thoughts") speech, 
grabbed a bite and a club soda, and mingled hither and yon. "My role with this 
group is to lead them through the process of looking at contemporary art," 
Barnes said before she addressed the group. As leader, she'll take them 
day-tripping to artists' studios, art galleries and museums, and several times 
a year guide longer jaunts to artistic points of interest in San Francisco and 
other California destinations. Barnes said the annual $50,000 the club gives 
the museum represents more than half of her budget for the "New California 
Artist" series.

A MOST UNLIKELY DEVOTEE IS '100% SALSERA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mention salsa in Orange County, and the name Rae Arroyo often enters the 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
She is the Tuesday night host of the Latin Connection, which has been bringing 
the salsa sound to Orange County for 10 years on station KSBR-FM (88.5), which 
broadcasts from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. from Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
During the day, she and her husband, Damian, operate their record shop, the 
Salsa Connection, in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
At 51, she is a walking library on such salsa greats as Eddie Palmieri, Celia 
Cruz, Willie Colon, Ray Bareto and her favorite, Tito Puente. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for a Jewish woman from New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
What's even more interesting is that Arroyo can roll her Rs and has learned to 
pronounce the names of different salsa bands, or bandas, like a pro. 
</P>
<P>
"People laugh when I tell them I'm not Latina," she said in a recent interview. 
"I laugh at myself sometimes because I'm such an advocate for Latinos. But you 
know what? I'm a salsera. One hundred percent salsera. I just love the music. 
In fact, my husband, who is Puerto Rican, taught me the language, and he had to 
be taught the music from me!" 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo is pleased that some Los Angeles Spanish-language radio stations that 
used to stick to Latin pop-rock are acknowledging Southern California's 
increasingly diversified Latino audience by playing more salsa. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, not too many of these radio stations touched the stuff, until 
the movie 'Salsa' came out. Now, they're jumping on the bandwagon," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Salsa has become so popular in Orange County that she has opened her own small 
club in Santa Ana. She plans to have live salsa bands every Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Since July, she has been working as a weekend disc jockey at Ruckus Restaurant 
in Orange. Each Friday and Saturday night, Arroyo closes her record shop at 7 
p.m. and then rushes to the restaurant in Orange, where she sits and waits 
while the waiters push aside the salad bar and stack the tables and chairs, 
revealing a dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
For four solid hours, she mixes her music from mellow to hot, just to keep the 
audience dancing. 
</P>
<P>
As customers enter Ruckus Restaurant, they often recognize Arroyo and give 
friendly waves in her direction as she points to vacant chairs. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a listener of mine," she said. "She and I go way back. Hey, hi, Linda. 
Look, there's an extra seat over there. Sit there. I'll talk to you in a 
minute." 
</P>
<P>
She added: "I like to kick off with something hot, then move into something 
mellow. Perhaps a merengue, and then open the night up with a salsa. You got to 
keep the dancers on their feet and play a variety of music to keep them happy." 
</P>
<P>
For Arroyo, her love of salsa began when she was young. At age 13, she 
remembers that her father, a jazz devotee and Sephardic Jew who was born in 
Turkey, introduced her to the Puerto Rican- and Cuban-flavored urban sound. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a sewing machine operator in New Jersey who really enjoyed his music on 
the weekends," she said. "He gave me this love for the music." 
</P>
<P>
In November, Arroyo recently got on stage at the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano and introduced Puente, a salsa master. 
</P>
<P>
For Arroyo, it was her moment in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"That was really one of my greatest pleasures," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 14, I saw Tito for the first time at the New York Palladium. I kind 
of snuck in, ordered a Coke, and when the music started, I got swept away by 
his playing, and tears started rolling down my cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
"This man's music, his salsa, still makes me get emotional."

TWILIGHT FOR SEN. CRANSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alan Cranston, the only Democrat in California history who was elected to the 
U.S. Senate four times, is in the twilight of a long and generally memorable 
career of public service. His political sun is not going down because he has 
been found guilty of anything.. ..It is setting because he has been found 
wanting by voters. 
</P>
<P>
A Times poll found this week that big majorities are suspicious of his 
relations with Charles H. Keating Jr., a high-rolling financier whose failed 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine may wind up costing taxpayers more than $2 
billion to protect its depositors. Nearly 80% of the people who were asked 
think Cranston was wrong to take campaign contributions from Keating and then 
argue Keating's case to federal regulators who were trying to take over Lincoln 
Savings before it collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, 75, is a truly global thinker -- a rare condition in American 
politics -- who cares deeply about such issues as arms control and the plight 
of veterans. He is a gifted organizer who helped guide his party back into 
prominence in the 1950s and who astonishes his fellow senators with his ability 
to predict the way they will vote, a trick he performs often as the Senate's 
Democratic whip. 
</P>
<P>
But he also has a rare, if not unique, attitude toward fund-raising. Where most 
politicians put reaching for a campaign check on a par with walking a plank, 
Cranston once told The Times that he enjoys gathering cash to promote his and 
his party's causes. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston gathered more than $900,000 from Keating, some for his own campaigns 
but most of it to promote voter registration, a program now being investigated 
both by the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston says the voters have been confused by wild, unfounded charges growing 
out of the Lincoln Savings scandal, and that once people understand what really 
happened, they will come around. He may be right, but he cannot count on that. 
The senator is not the only politician who carries a smudge where he came in 
contact with Keating. Four fellow senators have the same problem, as does Gov. 
George Deukmejian, a Republican. The governor, too, denies wrongdoing, but he 
has received $153,000 directly or indirectly from Keating, and the governor's 
chief fund-raiser is also a lobbyist for Keating. Voters in The Times poll were 
very suspicious about that, too. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian announced some time ago that he would retire next year, at the end 
of his second term, for reasons that had nothing to do with the Keating 
scandal. Cranston might well give thought to emulating the governor and bowing 
out when his own term ends in 1992.

A TRADE PACT THAT REALLY WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was only the second meeting the Canada-United States Trade Commission 
created by the free trade agreement between the two giant trading partners, but 
already there was action to accelerate implementation of the historic 
agreement. Clearly, the pact is working. 
</P>
<P>
John C. Crosbie, Canada's minister of international trade, and Carla Hills, U.S 
Trade representative, met at the end of November in Ottawa in their capacities 
as commission members, and quickly reached agreement on speeding elimination of 
tariffs on more than 400 items with a bilateral trade value of $6 million. 
Parliamentary and congressional approval are now required, but that does not 
seem to pose any problem. The cuts were requested by the industries themselves 
and no opposition has been voiced. Without this action, some of the tariffs 
could have remained in force for the full 10-year transition period provided 
for implementation of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Crosbie and Hills also were able to express satisfaction with the way the 
free-trade agreement, implemented just 11 months earlier, is working. They 
acknowledged that the agreement had not resolved all of the bilateral 
disagreements that inevitably occur, but the atmosphere of negotiations held 
promise of working out solutions more readily than in some of the trade 
confrontations that preceded the global agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The two nations, with about $200 billion in trade between them, represent the 
largest bilateral trade in the world.

GET WITH THE PROGRAM, GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why does Gov. Deukmejian persist in prolonging the effects of his terrible 
decision to put the state's family planning budget? By fighting a court order 
to restore the two-thirds cut he made to the $36 million program, he 
demonstrates a baffling intransigence. Worse, he demonstrates a lack of regard 
for the real-life consequences of such a drastic budget cut. 
</P>
<P>
Budgets figures tend to sound a little dry. But we can offer some other numbers 
that represent real flesh and blood: In Los Angeles County, some 4,200 women a 
month can no longer afford to get tested for cervical cancer, venereal disease 
or pregnancy, or receive family planning counseling. That is because the budget 
cuts, initiated by the governor and allowed to occur by the Legislature, shut 
down 37 family planning clinics statewide, with 17 in Los Angeles County alone. 
</P>
<P>
According to family planning officials, more then 75% of the women who frequent 
the government-funded clinics have an annual income of $12,100 or less for a 
family of four. Before the cuts took effect in September, these women used to 
wait two or three days for a clinic appointment. Now, the average wait is six 
to eight weeks. One does not need to be a doctor to understand what a 
six-to-eight week delay can mean in diagnosing pregnancy or disease. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week the governor indicated that he was willing to work with 
legislators to find a solution to this problem when they reconvene in 
Sacramento next month. A spokesman for the governor said that the court order 
issued by San Luis Obispo County Superior Court Judge William Fredman violated 
the principle that the executive and legislative branches ought to settle the 
matter. But in explaining his order, Fredman cited a principle that the 
governor seems to have forgotten: Basic health care should not be denied to 
people because they cannot afford it. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the unintended pregnancies and undetected gynecological diseases 
that are likely to occur because of the budget cuts, state government must 
decide to either pay now-- or pay a lot more later. Some 4,200 women in Los 
Angeles County had better keep their fingers crossed between now and the time 
the Legislature reconvenes next month.

<P>
BASEBALL: CHARLES O'CONNOR TOOK OVER AT THE LAST MINUTE AS LEAD NEGOTIATOR FOR 
BASEBALL MANAGEMENT. WILL HIS OUTLOOK AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE TALKS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NASHVILLE, Tenn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a former high school catcher and lifelong baseball fan who graduated from 
Holy Cross and the Boston College law school, Charles O'Connor is heir to a New 
England legacy. 
</P>
<P>
He has been tormented, he said, by the cruel destiny of the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a picture of the left field wall at Fenway Park still hangs in 
his office at the Park Avenue law firm of Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius in New 
York. Rooting for the Red Sox may seem sublime compared to the tormenting task 
confronting O'Connor, a labor lawyer for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
As the recently appointed lead negotiator and interim executive director of the 
baseball owners' Player Relations Committee, O'Connor, 49, will try to convince 
the Major League Players Assn. that sweeping changes are needed in the economic 
structure of the collective bargaining agreement. He will try, in some measure, 
to turn back the clock. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal presented to the union includes a modified salary cap and 
restrictions on free agency, but the owners' quest seems to be for what 
O'Connor calls an "evening of the playing field," an attempt to put teams in 
smaller markets on a comparable footing with those in larger markets. 
</P>
<P>
This key to the owners' proposal is that all 26 teams share equally in the 
payment of salaries to players with zero to six years of major league service. 
Those salaries would be determined by performance statistics. Arbitration for 
players in that category would be eliminated. So would the need for agents. 
</P>
<P>
The first negotiations were held in New York last week. They will resume in Los 
Angeles Tuesday through Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
If significant progress has not been made by the start of spring training, 
O'Connor said in his suite at baseball's winter meetings here the other day, 
the owners might resort to a lockout. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Rona, his predecessor, had targeted Feb. 15, but O'Connor won't specify a 
date, saying he has told the union only that the clubs want an agreement before 
the season, meaning before spring training. He cited the obvious reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The saving of spring expenses and payment of player salaries, coinciding, 
in most cases, with the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The desire to avoid a midseason shutdown, such as the 51-day player strike 
of 1981, and the pressures relating to completing the season once it starts. 
</P>
<P>
"Every labor negotiation has the potential for a lockout or strike," he said. 
"The fact of the matter is that 98% never use either weapon. The system 
functions so that the pressures exerted on either side -- the union with its 
strike and management with its shutdown -- are just that, pressure points and 
leverage points. 
</P>
<P>
"They point to the alternative, and usually when people look at the 
alternative, they find a way to resolve their differences." 
</P>
<P>
Both sides are financially prepared for a stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
Would the owners open spring training and continue to negotiate if there were 
assurance from the union that it would not strike? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor shook his head and said that the promise of labor peace for a season 
would not be enough. He said that the clubs require changes in the compensation 
system and would consider opening the season only if there was assurance of 
peace and some agreements already in place. 
</P>
<P>
A hard liner? O'Connor's reputation is that of a conciliator. He is a labor 
lawyer by choice, that being the only part of the law that ever intrigued him, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
His practice has been directly related to collective bargaining and contract 
enforcement in such industries as trucking, brewing, construction and public 
services. It is a career, he said with a laugh, that had seldom made him the 
subject of media attention. 
</P>
<P>
He and his labor-oriented firm -- one of the largest in the country -- were 
hired by then-Commissioner Peter Ueberroth two years ago to work with Rona and 
the PRC. 
</P>
<P>
Why Rona, who had been with the PRC throughout the '80s, resigned on the eve of 
the current negotiations is still not clear, although some maintain that he was 
pressured by owners who believed he contributed to collusion and the work 
stoppages of the last two labor negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Fay Vincent has emphasized improved relations with the union, and 
some owners reportedly figured there was need for a fresh face at the 
bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said he does not pretend to be a baseball expert and has trouble 
remembering which players are on which teams. He credits Rona for being an 
effective teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"His absence is a loss, but the transition won't be difficult," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
A conciliator? 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody in my business has to be optimistic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Conciliator? Yes. But the thing I'd be concerned about is that I don't think 
-- at least in my experience dealing with union leaders and management leaders 
-- that you should ever confuse civility with weakness. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, the person who is civil and willing to reach out, is also the 
one you have to watch the longest. 
</P>
<P>
"So I don't shrink from the term. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the one thing good lawyers have in common is the ability to find a way 
to conciliate an agreement." 
</P>
<P>
He will make his attempt at a time when the market has become a gold mine for 
the players. Seldom, even in the early years of free agency, has there been a 
more dramatic escalation of salaries. How does such spending equate to the 
owners' alleged need for changes in the compensation system? 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor said there are two aspects of it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The recent signings should address the union's legitimate concerns that the 
two collusion decisions permanently hurt the market's ability to bounce back. 
The market has worked its will and bounced back. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And in the process, he said, it should be providing a clear signal to the 
union that not all 26 teams can afford to play such a high-stakes game. The 
industry, with its current pattern, might soon belong to the big-market elite, 
undermining competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
The sides should take advantage of today's relatively good financial situation 
to produce a system that would assure long-term stability and cost-certainty to 
all 26 teams, a system to be eased in over the life of the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make the playing field fairer, not eliminate free agency," he said. 
"There would still be a free market because clubs would be spending their own 
money for players with six or more years, but the savings through a 1/26 
funding of the players in the zero-to-six category would provide the clubs with 
a measure of cost certainty and predictability. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the objective, but we're not married to any proposal. The manner in 
which you reach an objective is part of the bargaining process. We do happen to 
think that the statistical framework we came up with is a good starting point, 
a legitimate basis to judge players." 
</P>
<P>
Don Fehr, the union's executive director, conducted meetings with the 26 player 
representatives in Scottsdale, Ariz., this week and said the activity of this 
winter resembled the market before collusion. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the money being spent was the $100 million to $200 million that 
the clubs saved during collusion. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever validity there was to the clubs' claim of financial distress during 
the last negotiations, Fehr said, has long since evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
He said the industry is extremely healthy and that he expected increases in 
minimum salary and pension benefits. He said he couldn't address revenue 
sharing because the PRC has yet to define revenue or explain how much is to be 
shared. 
</P>
<P>
And of the new face at the bargaining table? Fehr wondered how talk of a 
lockout and economic warfare relates to conciliation. 
</P>
<P>
"I can make an argument that there will be a softening," Fehr said. "I can make 
an argument that there will be a hardening. I can make an argument that it 
doesn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I lean toward the latter. Barry Rona was not the policy maker. He took orders 
and acted on those orders. 
</P>
<P>
"Bud Selig (the Milwaukee Brewers' owner) was chairman of the PRC and is still 
chairman. The negotiations aren't driven by personalities but by issues. 
</P>
<P>
"If indeed Rona's absence is a softening, it should be apparent in the 
direction the negotiations take. We'll see in time."
