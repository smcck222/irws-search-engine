By KEVIN THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kevin Dobson stars in the new TV movie Money, Power, Murder (CBS Sunday at 9 
p.m.) as a maverick reporter on a cable news station on the trail of a missing 
network anchorwoman. Blythe Danner co-stars. 
</P>
<P>
George Peppard once again plays homicide detective Frank Doakey in Man Against 
the Mob: The Chinatown Murders (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.). Set in Los Angeles in 
the 1940s, this new TV movie finds Doakey investigating a mob-run prostitution 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Child (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), a flabby disappointment, finds L.A. 
social worker Eddie Murphy trying to wrest the Golden Child, a short of Dalai 
Lama-like creature of perfection, from Satanic forces. 
</P>
<P>
Dinner at Eight (TNT Monday at 7 p.m.) is a new made-for-cable remake of the 
1933 MGM production in which an all-star cast portrayed various levels of 
society invited to dine in New York City. Lauren Bacall stars. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet Dreams (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m.), the tangy 1985 biography of country 
singing star Patsy Cline, stars a well-cast Jessica Lange and Ed Harris as 
Cline's volatile husband. Karel Reisz directed from Robert Getchell's 
trenchant, compassionate script. 
</P>
<P>
Nutcracker (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.), Carroll Ballard's 1986 film of the 
Pacific Northwest Ballet Company production, is surprisingly disappointing -- 
beautifully designed (by Maurice Sendak, no less) but awkwardly edited. 
</P>
<P>
The new TV movie Lady in a Corner (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) stars Loretta Young as 
a fashion magazine editor fighting for control of the publication with a young, 
power-hungry editor (Lindsay Frost). 
</P>
<P>
Mel Shavelson's 1955 The Seven Little Foys (Channel 11 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is 
one of Bob Hope's most enjoyable movies, in which he plays vaudevillian Eddie 
Foy. James Cagney reprises his George M. Cohan in a cameo. 
</P>
<P>
Honkytonk Man (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is one of Clint Eastwood's most 
personal and engaging pictures. Taking a breather from action movies, Eastwood 
directs himself as a down-and-out Depression-era country singer struggling to 
make it to the Grand Ole Opry before he dies. There's a poignant relationship 
between this man and his nephew, played by Eastwood's own son Kyle. 
</P>
<P>
The 1979 Murder by Decree (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) boasts Christopher 
Plummer as Sherlock Holmes and James Mason as Dr. Watson, but the notion of 
pitting Holmes vs. Jack the Ripper was actually done more effectively in the 
more modest 1965 "Study in Terror." 
</P>
<P>
The Oscar-winning 1967 In the Heat of the Night (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 
p.m.), which inspired the NBC series, boasts bravura performances by Rod 
Steiger as a redneck police chief and Sidney Poitier as an urbane and competent 
black cop who comes to help solve a Mississippi murder. 
</P>
<P>
The Seven-Percent Solution (Channel 5 Friday at 8 p.m.) is a particularly 
handsome and charming period piece, a fictional conjecture about what Sherlock 
Holmes (Nicol Williamson) was really like and why. Holmes has been ensnared by 
cocaine, and Watson (Robert Duvall) leads him to Vienna hoping that Sigmund 
Freud (Alan Arkin) can help him. To be sure, adventure also awaits him. 
</P>
<P>
With Gonza the Spearman (Channel 28 Friday at midnight), director Masahiro 
Shinoda and his actress-wife Shima Awashita have made another flawless film 
from an 18th-Century Chikamatsu bunraku puppet play -- their first was the 
landmark "Double Suicide." Awashita plays a nobleman's wife innocently but 
hopelessly compromised by her husband's dashing clansman Gonza (Hiromi Goh). 
</P>
<P>
The Secret Garden (CBS Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a stylish 1987 presentation of 
Frances Hodgson Burnett's 1911 story about an orphan brought from India to live 
in a gloomy English castle. 
</P>
<P>
The Great White Hope (Channel 5 Saturday at 8 p.m.) is a highly fictionalized 
account of the tumultuous life of Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight 
champion. This big-scale work, directed by Martin Ritt, is of solid 
craftsmanship but little style. James Earl Jones' Johnson is, however, 
intensely vital and larger-than-life.

Epochal. Earth-shaking. Monumental. What's been happening in Eastern Europe 
ranks as one of the great news stories of the decade. Perhaps of the century. 
</P>
<P>
But viewers in this country have not been tuning in to see it, at least not in 
the kind of numbers one might expect. Not even when the Berlin Wall all but 
fell crashing to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"It just didn't play," says a spokeswoman for ABC News. "The ratings are down a 
little bit across the board," says a spokesman for CBS News. "They certainly 
haven't gone up." 
</P>
<P>
America is soft on communism. And the decline and fall thereof. 
</P>
<P>
But why? Here is a story of drama, significance and impact, told through often 
sensational pictures: Families streaming through newly opened borders. Loved 
ones reunited. Masses marching. Decades-old barriers crumbling as whole 
societies make giant leaps toward freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who touched this story saw their ratings go down," says Richard Kaplan, 
executive producer of the ABC News series "PrimeTime Live," whose program on 
the Berlin Wall was the lowest-rated installment that aired up to that time. 
</P>
<P>
Viewership for the three network evenings newscasts is off from the same period 
a year ago. Special reports on Berlin that aired on ABC, CBS and NBC scored 
ratings that were mediocre or meager or worse. The Nielsens gave no sign of 
voracious or even above-average interest. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in network news is scratching their heads about this," says Kaplan. 
"I can see where the average Joe might not care that much about Poland or 
Czechoslovakia, but the Berlin Wall is universal; you couldn't grow up not 
knowing about it. It's a tangible Iron Curtain, albeit one made of brick, and 
it falls, and nobody cares. I can't figure it out." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Turner, news director of CNN, says his network's audience hasn't seemed 
fascinated with the story, either. "Much to my astonishment, I think that's 
true, at least in this sense: The ratings have not shown a leap as they did 
with China earlier this year or with the earthquake in San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you what it may prove," says Reuven Frank, former president of NBC 
News. "It may prove that Geraldo Rivera is right and the rest of us are wrong, 
God help us. Maybe he's the one who knows what news is. Maybe if four people 
sat around and talked about it with Oprah Winfrey, people would listen." 
</P>
<P>
Frank doesn't feel TV news has failed the audience with its coverage of the 
story. "As far as whether the networks are doing it right -- the depth of 
analysis tends to be rather shallow, but other than that, they're doing it as 
right as they can." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we in the news business should be insulted by the ratings," says 
Andrew Lack, executive producer of "Saturday Night With Connie Chung" on CBS. 
"And I wouldn't infer from the ratings that people don't care about it. I think 
there's a repetitive quality to the coverage and people realize that. They know 
something's going on; I just don't think they need to miss 'L.A. Law' to see 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, you do not see network-rating lifts with internationally based 
stories," says David M. Poltrack, the executive vice president in charge of 
research for CBS. Poltrack doesn't feel this is a failure by network news; it's 
just a matter of viewer preference. "You see ratings lifts on domestic-based 
stories like earthquakes and hurricanes." 
</P>
<P>
And yet ratings did shoot up for coverage of the uprising and massacre in 
China. ABC News President Roone Arledge has told colleagues that he thinks slim 
viewer interest in Eastern Europe may be traced to the fact that the story 
hasn't had the threat of violence hanging over it, as China did. CNN's Turner 
agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"This story is good news," Turner says. "Had there been a Tiananmen Square in 
Berlin, we would have had tremendous ratings. This did not have the macabre 
appeal that death and destruction do." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps viewers are uncomfortable with the feeling that the United States 
suddenly seems to sit on the sidelines of history instead of in the thick of 
it. Now the Soviet Union and its crumbling bloc are the focal point of the 
world's attention. Earlier, it was China. It used to be us. 
</P>
<P>
America isn't the news epicenter it was, and Americans may even subconsciously 
resent that the big stories are happening elsewhere. Despite the everyday 
wonders of the satellite link, the Global Village may still be a long way off. 
A National Village prevails. It's one wall that has not fallen. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to argue that our (national) priorities are in the right 
places," says Poltrack, "but we in the news business can only just keep 
trying."

The new shows that CBS, NBC and CBS have brought to us are terrible. The 
sitcoms are not funny and the dramas are boring. The only network that has come 
up with good new shows this season is Fox. So far it has given us "Booker," 
"Open House" and "Alien Nation," each of which is entertaining. When you add 
those to shows such as "America's Most Wanted," "Married . . . With Children," 
"Tracey Ullman" and "21 Jump Street," you get many hours of entertaining 
programming.

MAKING SENSE OF MAUREEN; 
</P>
<P>
THE CURIOUS POLITICS OF SAN DIEGO'S MAYOR O'CONNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN and BARRY M. HORSTMAN, Leonard Bernstein and Barry M. 
Horstman are staff writers for The Times' San Diego edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHE HAD MASTERED the Soviet bureaucracy, defied her critics at home, and now, 
at the pinnacle of her political career, San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor would 
have to take on Mother Nature as well. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60,000 people were jammed into the city's beloved Balboa Park for 
"Super Powers Sunday," the opening ceremony of the three-week Soviet arts 
festival to which O'Connor had devoted the past 16 months. Crushed together in 
the park's open-air Spreckels Organ Pavilion on a late October day, thousands 
anxiously awaited the start of the ceremony as colorfully costumed children 
joined O'Connor and a troupe of Soviet Georgian dancers on stage. 
</P>
<P>
And then it started to rain. The mayor's audience headed for cover. 
</P>
<P>
"Please, these people have come all the way from Tbilisi to dance for you," 
O'Connor implored, shielding herself from the rain with a festival program. "I 
don't care if it's raining; it's shining on San Diego!" 
</P>
<P>
As if on cue, the drizzle stopped. Within the hour, the sun was out, and for 
the rest of Super Powers Sunday, the skies were as bright as O'Connor's beaming 
face. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, the mayor basked in the kind of public adoration that is 
the stuff of a politician's dreams. At some of the Balboa Park sites, where 
Soviet dancers and singers performed for thousands, O'Connor herself drew 
rousing ovations. Scores of San Diegans approached her entourage to pose for 
pictures or ask for autographs. Others shouted praise: "It's a great party, 
Maureen." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, that's all it was. 
</P>
<P>
That O'Connor considers the $6-million arts extravaganza the triumph of her 
curious 3 1/2 years in office speaks volumes about the woman who in less than 
two decades has risen from high school gym teacher to first female mayor of 
America's sixth-largest city. The festival posed the essential question 
skeptics have raised throughout O'Connor's mayoralty: Why doesn't she bring the 
same planning, dedication and hands-on approach to the city's long-term 
problems that she devoted to assembling the world's largest public showing of 
Faberge Imperial Eggs? 
</P>
<P>
Frequently absent from the chambers of government while she served as virtual 
executive producer of the festival, the 43-year-old mayor has only sporadically 
functioned as the city's leader. When the festival ended Nov. 12, the homeless 
were still sleeping in Balboa Park canyons near the exhibition areas. San 
Diego's roads remained choked, its library and sewer system antiquated and 
inadequate. Despite recent staffing increases, the city's police force was 
still undermanned in the face of crack cocaine traffic and street-gang warfare. 
Its trash-disposal crisis was mounting. It was no closer to finding a 
substitute for its crowded and dangerous airport. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, O'Connor inherited most of the urban ills that confront San Diego -- 
crises that are similar to those facing every rapidly growing city. But 
sometimes it seems she is running an increasingly complex metropolis as if it 
were still the small city of her youth. 
</P>
<P>
"Maureen O'Connor is a risk-averse politician," says Steven Erie, a UC San 
Diego political scientist who has tracked O'Connor's career. "She's so 
incredibly cautious, so unwilling to take bold steps that, at best, she 
provides a reactive style of leadership. You don't get any sense of the 
direction in which she'd like to take the city, or whether she even knows. What 
we're left with is essentially a caretaker administration." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor has heard it all before, particularly during the past two years, as 
the festival grew from a casual conversation with a Soviet culture official in 
Scotland to a major spectacle. "Let's just take a minute to remember what San 
Diego was like before Maureen O'Connor became mayor," O'Connor snapped when 
asked about these criticisms in a recent interview. "When I came in office 
three years ago, this place was a mess. The (previous) mayor had just been 
convicted of a felony, there was a councilman under indictment, a Housing 
Commission scandal, the city manager and council weren't working together, we 
had a police department at odds with the city, problems like sewage, crime. 
</P>
<P>
"Every single issue that was waiting on my plate has been improved. Critics 
might say we're only 50% or 75% of the way there, but they can't deny the 
progress that's been made. This city's working again." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's effect has been felt both inside and outside City Hall, though often 
in ways difficult to record on a score card. Although political insiders 
quibble over whether the mayor lost this vote or dropped the ball on that 
issue, she is widely credited with returning integrity to a City Hall racked by 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
"She's restored people's faith in city government, which is no small thing," 
says Louis Wolfsheimer, a land-use attorney and longtime O'Connor confidant. 
"As far as issues, she's identified the problems, knows what needs to be done 
and is moving the city ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Others are not nearly so charitable. In an anonymous survey of City Hall 
lobbyists, reporters and government staffers taken in February by the San Diego 
Report, a monthly political newsletter, O'Connor placed last in overall 
performance among the nine council members. She ranked seventh in 
effectiveness, eighth in intelligence and quality of staff, and last in 
accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
Most often, she is criticized for abdicating responsibility on major issues, 
for lacking vision, for failing to display the leadership that her position 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
As mayor, O'Connor's "not one of the boys anymore," says county Supervisor 
Brian Bilbray, a frequent critic. "People are expecting you to stand up and be 
heard. You either do that, or you don't take on a position of leadership." 
</P>
<P>
STREET SMARTS 
</P>
<P>
MAUREEN O'CONNOR IS wandering around Balboa Park, pressing the flesh of the 
faithful who have come to celebrate her finest hour. She is in her element. She 
is with her people. She is on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a tapered gray jacket with the oversized, padded shoulders she 
favors, O'Connor strolls arm-in-arm with Mikhail Gribanov, the Soviet acting 
minister of culture, and his entourage. 
</P>
<P>
To the Soviets, who are not accustomed to a woman mayor or one so young, the 
constant displays of public affection for O'Connor are clearly intriguing. 
"Everyone's calling you by your first name, which is fascinating," remarks an 
interpreter. "This is quite amazing." 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, they all call me 'Maureen,' " the mayor replies breezily, breaking into a 
broad grin. "That's how I'm known here. That's why they call me 'the street 
mayor.' " 
</P>
<P>
Say what they will about O'Connor's performance in office, even her critics do 
not deny that she is genuinely popular on San Diego's streets. A Democrat in a 
city long controlled by a Republican old-boy network and a slow-growth advocate 
among the wealthy builders who have dominated the political landscape, O'Connor 
has charmed San Diego with her schoolgirl style and from-the-heart 
pronouncements since she was elected a city councilwoman. 
</P>
<P>
"She's not one of these politicians who puts a wall up between her and the 
people," said Georgia Tarwater, a festival volunteer from La Jolla, as she 
watched O'Connor, attired in black jeans, boots, a purple cowboy hat and 
matching scarf, dance at a Western-theme barbecue during the arts festival. 
"Her sense of caring is genuine and comes across that way. That's what makes 
her so approachable." 
</P>
<P>
"People perceive her as being a San Diegan, which in this town is critical," 
says Mark Nelson, former executive director of the San Diego Taxpayers Assn. 
"People perceive her as being part of San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Raised in a lower-middle-class San Diego home, the daughter of a 
convenience-store owner and part-time bookie, O'Connor became a 
multimillionaire in 1977 when she married Jack in the Box restaurant-chain 
founder Robert O. Peterson, a man 30 years her senior. Although she now lives 
in a Spanish-style Point Loma mansion with a bay view, O'Connor never forgets 
that the Mission Hills home of her childhood sometimes went unheated. "At 
night," she recalls, "when it was really cold and you had your blanket on, you 
might wake up and find it gone because someone had come in and taken it. So you 
learned how to sleep with your blanket between your knees for protection." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor and her twin sister, Mavourneen, were born July 14, 1946, the seventh 
and eighth of the 13 children of Jerome and Frances O'Connor. O'Connor 
remembers her childhood as "a pretty no-frills life." Dining out and going to 
movies were rarities, and only the children's parochial-school uniforms 
disguised their lack of clothing. One year, when the family could not afford a 
Thanksgiving turkey, one of O'Connor's brothers molded a bird from hamburger. 
</P>
<P>
An average student known more for her sense of humor than her scholarship, the 
future mayor's entry into politics was delayed when Rosary High nuns, who found 
her too feisty, barred her from running for student body president. Instead, 
O'Connor helped Mavourneen get elected to the post. Maureen graduated in 1964 
and attended San Diego State University, earning a bachelor's degree with a 
triple major in recreation, psychology and sociology in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
With her parents and most of her siblings still living in San Diego, the 
O'Connor family is extremely close, despite the split between what O'Connor 
describes as her "Archie Bunker brothers" and "liberal sisters." 
</P>
<P>
She credits her parents for her public-service career. By the time O'Connor was 
a teen-ager, she and her six sisters had become accomplished precision and 
rough-water swimmers, touring the country in 1964 as the "Swimming O'Connor 
Sisters," part of a traveling show called "The Wonderful World of Sport." 
O'Connor's mother, a nurse, introduced her children to community service by 
having them give swimming lessons to multiple sclerosis patients. 
</P>
<P>
"At a very young age, you had a sense of being responsible for someone other 
than yourself, of working for the good of the group," O'Connor recalls. "Public 
service is a natural outgrowth of that." 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, after O'Connor had started teaching physical education at Rosary High, 
she went to City Hall to complain about the treatment a troupe of 
Mexican-Indian performers had received during a city celebration. When she got 
the runaround, she resolved to run for office, more out of a desire to teach 
her students a civics lesson than out of ambition. 
</P>
<P>
Later that year, O'Connor and her twin sister, guided by a borrowed library 
book on political campaigning, called a news conference to announce that 
O'Connor would make a long-shot run for City Council. She likes to tell the 
story of how, at the appointed hour, the gym was crammed with her partisans, 
mostly students and nuns. 
</P>
<P>
Only the media failed to show. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that inauspicious beginning, the lightly regarded candidate went on to 
score a stunning upset on a shoestring budget, aided by hundreds of Rosary High 
student volunteers dubbed "the Maureen Corps." After qualifying for the 
two-candidate council runoff, O'Connor became, at 25, the youngest person ever 
elected to the San Diego City Council. 
</P>
<P>
She served for eight years, becoming a member of then-Mayor Pete Wilson's inner 
circle and a protege of his despite their differing party affiliations. 
O'Connor went on to become a port commissioner and member of the Metropolitan 
Transit Development Board, winning credit for overseeing the complicated 
negotiations that created San Diego's trolley line, which opened in 1981. In 
1983, she lost a bitter race for mayor against county Supervisor Roger 
Hedgecock. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, when Hedgecock was forced to resign as mayor after his 
conviction for perjury, O'Connor won the special election to complete his term 
by a 10-point margin. Last year, in her first bid for a full four-year term as 
mayor, O'Connor, enjoying name recognition and a lingering honeymoon from her 
1986 victory, was considered so unbeatable that no serious opponent would run 
against her. She was reelected with 60% of the vote. Although Times surveys 
show her popularity rating has slipped from 69% to 48% in the past year and a 
half, O'Connor's current 2-to-1 favorable rating is nonetheless healthy for a 
midterm mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by public support, aided by her remarkable political and public 
relations savvy, O'Connor repeatedly thumbs her nose at the downtown power 
structure and maintains a bond with San Diego citizens that delights her 
supporters and intimidates her opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"My style's probably confusing to those who make their living off politics -- 
the Chamber of Commerce types, land-use attorneys, people like that," O'Connor 
says. "They're used to coming to City Hall and talking to the mayor over a 
desk. Well, I don't have to be behind a desk to know what's going on in the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS 
</P>
<P>
O'CONNOR'S POPULARITY on the street makes it all the more surprising to view 
her at City Hall. She is distant, isolated and defensive, guarded by a staff 
that is protective even by political standards. Uncomfortable as the city's 
official figurehead, O'Connor hates to pose for photographs. She is a painfully 
inept speaker, even when reading from a prepared text. And despite an 18-year 
political career, she is amazingly thin-skinned: In November, O'Connor demanded 
that a local newspaper print a clarification of a description of her as the 
"gum-chewing Mayor O'Connor." The mayor, her spokesman insisted, was munching a 
breath mint. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to her zest for conversation with the common man in "the 
neighborhoods," as O'Connor calls them, the mayor appears uncomfortable dealing 
with some of the high-powered leaders who must command her attention. County 
supervisors, Chamber of Commerce executives and fellow mayors have waited in 
vain for O'Connor to return telephone calls about important city business. 
Prominent political players have been issued hints to line up with the hoi 
polloi for five minutes with O'Connor at twice-monthly "Meet the Mayor" 
sessions. Even as the county's Superior Court judges considered moving the 
court system out of downtown because of a space crunch, they could not gain an 
audience with O'Connor to discuss the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We've found it's much more effective to work around the mayor's office than to 
work with it," Supervisor Bilbray says, "because there's just no access." 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, when she traveled to Sacramento for a hearing on the proposed 
merger of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, the 
mayor alienated a host of legislators with her behavior, according to 
Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Chula Vista). O'Connor has worked hard to thwart the 
merger, persuading the City Council to spend more than $2 million on lawyers 
for regulatory proceedings. She fears a loss of local control of the utility, 
1,000 lost jobs and higher utility rates. 
</P>
<P>
But "you don't win votes by insulting people," Peace says. "In particular, you 
don't do so when you also demonstrate a profound lack of knowledge on the 
subject matter you're dealing with. Unfortunately, the mayor came up and didn't 
sound like a professional person or an elected official or an informed 
community leader or like an educated consumer activist. She came up sounding 
shrill and offensive." 
</P>
<P>
Vowing never to run for higher office while holding an elected post, O'Connor 
is almost apolitical when it comes to other candidates' races. The mayor almost 
never issues endorsements; she infuriated local Democrats and aides for Michael 
S. Dukakis last year by failing to appear at a downtown rally for the 
presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her populist proclivities, O'Connor maintains a kitchen cabinet that 
includes prominent land-use attorneys, relies on the financial backing of 
McDonald's chain owner Joan Kroc and enjoys the editorial largess of friend 
Helen Copley, publisher of the Union and Tribune newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
But she leans most heavily on family members. Her sister Colleen, who made two 
trips to the Soviet Union to negotiate loans of festival artwork, is a frequent 
adviser who helps write O'Connor's yearly State of the City addresses. 
Mavourneen, a developer of low-cost senior citizen housing, is a frequent 
sounding board. And there's Peterson, a self-made political mover and shaker in 
San Diego despite suffering from leukemia for the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because of her insular style, O'Connor is deeply suspicious of the 
press, often dodging phone calls from all but a handful of local columnists who 
give her flattering treatment. The mayor prefers closed-door negotiation to 
public debate. She is quick to point out that citizens now are offered more 
time to speak at council meetings, but the City Council under O'Connor has 
shown a penchant for considering arguably public matters in private. Most 
recently, the council met privately to discuss a lawsuit filed by a Latino 
coalition seeking to expand the council from 8 to 12 seats, thereby improving 
minority representation. The city's attorneys argued that the council's 
discussion of its legal strategy should be privileged, but some observers 
believe that debate about the city's electoral system should be public. 
</P>
<P>
AFTERNOONS AT THE MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN O'Connor's style is her enduring contempt for Hedgecock, the 
only person to defeat her in an election, one she believes he captured by 
accepting illegal campaign contributions. Reporters at radio station KSDO, 
where Hedgecock is now an O'Connor-bashing talk-show host, believe that they 
are routinely denied interviews with the mayor because of his presence there. 
The mayor's spokesman denies the claim, but O'Connor maintains a strict policy 
of refusing to appear publicly with Hedgecock. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a convicted felon. He's on the radio, making $100,000. He is not 
repentant about his crime," says Paul Downey, a spokesman for O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
Some believe that O'Connor ran for mayor in 1986 simply to win. "Maureen wanted 
to prove that . . . '83 turned out the way it did because Roger had cheated," a 
former insider recalls. "There really wasn't much thought given to what would 
happen afterward or what the agenda would be. . . . Winning was an end in 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line for many, in fact, is the question of how interested O'Connor 
is in governing. From growth control to the airport to the trash crisis, she 
has abdicated leadership to council colleagues and left personal priorities 
unfinished. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor is not among the council's hardest workers, slipping out of her office 
occasionally to take in matinee movies (often police sagas). She has not 
attended a meeting of the Housing Commission, of which she is vice chairman, in 
more than seven months. (In her defense, Downey notes that O'Connor often 
guides the city's affairs via telephone from her home late into the night.) 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor steadfastly defends her performance, claiming that she works quietly 
and effectively behind the scenes, a style to which the public and the media 
are not accustomed. "There's no limit to what you can accomplish if you don't 
care who gets the credit," the mayor says, reciting one of her favorite 
political aphorisms. "My ego doesn't demand that my name be on everything." 
</P>
<P>
"I think she is vastly underrated as a leader," said Paul Peterson, a building 
industry lobbyist (no relation to O'Connor's husband) and informal adviser to 
the mayor. "I've seen her in action, and . . . the fact is she has a method of 
keeping the city on an even keel that's very effective." 
</P>
<P>
NO-FRILLS TO RICHES 
</P>
<P>
WHEN SUPER POWERS SUNDAY dawned cool and overcast, the mayor fretted to one of 
her closest friends, a nun whom she has known since her teaching days, about 
the weather's effect on the turnout. "Maureen's always afraid she's going to 
throw a party and no one will come," Sister Jeannette Black said, chuckling as 
she walked beside the mayor during the event, which proved to be the biggest 
single-day draw in the park's history. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor need not have worried. Pausing along the park's historic Prado, 
O'Connor stretched her 5-foot-2 frame for a view of the growing mid-afternoon 
crowd and could not help but smile at what she saw. Even before the skies 
cleared, attendance surpassed the most optimistic predictions. "Geez, Louise!" 
O'Connor said, squinting as she surveyed the scene. "This is a long way from 
Rosary High School." 
</P>
<P>
It was there in 1971 that, as a $450-a-month gym teacher and come-from-nowhere 
council candidate, O'Connor was pursued by a political power broker whose 
candidate had been eliminated during the primary. When Bob Peterson's repeated 
telephone calls to Rosary High began to irk the nuns in charge, O'Connor 
finally spoke to the man who "wanted to know about this girl that defeated his 
candidate." 
</P>
<P>
They began dating several years later and were married in a 1977 ceremony in 
the south of France. It was Peterson's fifth marriage, O'Connor's first, and a 
match O'Connor calls "the best decision I ever made." The couple separated 
after her 1983 election loss, filing divorce papers before reconciling less 
than a year later. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson is a man of diverse interests, including fabric dyeing, gourmet 
cooking and landscaping. He once invested in research about synthesizing 
firefly luminescence for medical use. Describing her husband as "truly a 
Renaissance man," O'Connor says he "broadened me tremendously . . . by exposing 
me to a world I'd never seen before." For a woman from less-than-comfortable 
beginnings, the marriage also has provided O'Connor with exotic vacations, 
designer clothing, a Mendocino retreat and a backyard lap pool behind a mansion 
where cooks prepare the meals. Perhaps because of her upbringing, O'Connor 
wears her new economic status almost self-consciously, despite the more 
powerful and glamorous circles in which she now travels. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson encouraged O'Connor to run for mayor, and she says her husband's 
chronic illness has never held her back. "He didn't want this to control his 
life," she says, "and it hasn't." But Peterson's leukemia often keeps him from 
attending public functions with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob's been extremely supportive," O'Connor adds. "This job would be difficult 
on any marriage, even without this additional problem. His health has its ups 
and downs, and we've just learned to live with it and keep moving ahead." 
</P>
<P>
CURSING 'LOS ANGELIZATION' 
</P>
<P>
O'CONNOR PRESIDES OVER a San Diego dramatically different from the city in 
which she grew up, or even the one that existed when she took office in 1971. 
During her two four-year terms on the council, San Diego began to outgrow its 
reputation as a sleepy Navy town near Tijuana to become one of the nation's 
largest cities -- and one of its fastest growing: Since 1970, San Diego's 
population has increased 58%, to 1.1 million. Between 1983, when O'Connor first 
ran for mayor, and 1988, more than 70,000 homes sprouted in San Diego's 
unprecedented building boom. 
</P>
<P>
The staggering growth rate has brought big-city problems that San Diegans curse 
as "Los Angelization" -- traffic jams, air and water pollution, vanishing open 
space, crowded schools and parks -- in short, a decline in the quality of life 
that brought many to the city in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Few question that O'Connor inherited significant challenges when she was 
inaugurated as mayor on July 7, 1986, to fill out Hedgecock's unexpired term. 
Hedgecock had spent much of his brief term absorbed in his legal battle, and 
his predecessor, Wilson, now the junior senator from California, had ended an 
11-year tenure as something of an absentee mayor while he campaigned for higher 
office. The city and City Hall were reeling from a handful of corruption 
scandals, most notably J. David Dominelli's 1984 Ponzi scheme, which defrauded 
investors of $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
Elected on a platform that emphasized slowing growth, O'Connor soon pushed 
through a landmark ordinance that for 18 months capped the number of homes that 
could be built citywide, though some of the city's most rapidly developing 
areas were exempted. Confronted by a conservative, developer-backed council 
majority, the new mayor also sought to convince the average citizen that he 
would be heard at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1986, community groups felt very strongly that developers had a lock on 
City Hall," O'Connor maintains. "Now the neighborhood groups feel very strongly 
that they're sitting at the decision-making table." 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1987, she persuaded the council to reverse its stand and begin the 
$2.8-billion task of cleaning up the city's sewage to comply with the federal 
Clean Water Act. The following year, however, the city was sued by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency for failing to comply quickly enough. As a 
result, it faces millions of dollars in fines. 
</P>
<P>
The new mayor also called for more police and a crackdown on street drug sales. 
This year, the council added 116 officers to the police force, slashing $5 
million from other parts of the city budget to do so. To establish tighter 
control by the City Council, O'Connor also took the Housing Commission away 
from its citizen board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
But as time wore on, the promising beginnings of O'Connor's tenure were 
replaced by her dawdling on issues and appointments, and, later, her devotion 
to the arts festival. O'Connor's performance on the growth issue, perhaps the 
city's most chronic problem, is illuminating. 
</P>
<P>
Ranked by the Sierra Club as the council's most dependable environmental vote, 
O'Connor nevertheless failed to campaign for the City Council's 1988 permanent 
growth-control initiative -- which had taken nearly two years to bring to the 
ballot -- until shortly before the election. With only days to go, the mayor 
abruptly endorsed both the city's measure and a stricter, rival initiative 
placed on the ballot by a slow-growth group. 
</P>
<P>
Both measures, and two more covering the unincorporated areas of San Diego 
County, were crushed by a nearly $3-million spending campaign mounted by 
developers, the most expensive campaign in city history. The council 
subsequently enacted a series of ordinances that accomplished some of the goals 
of the city's ballot measure, but not enough to satisfy some of the slow-growth 
advocates who helped propel O'Connor into office. O'Connor and others have said 
that the package of laws was the best they could get, given the City Council's 
composition. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Connor's critics accused her of doing too little too late. "If the 
building industry didn't have Maureen O'Connor, they'd have to invent her," 
says Peter Navarro, leader of the vanquished slow-growth organization Citizens 
for Limited Growth. "You have a figurehead mayor who projects the illusion that 
she's getting things done on growth management and the environment, and that 
keeps the public at bay." 
</P>
<P>
"Sooner or later," says Dick Dresner, a former O'Connor political consultant 
whom she dropped after the 1988 election, "people are going to realize that the 
emperor -- or, in this case, empress -- has no clothes." 
</P>
<P>
THE WEEKEND TRANSIENT 
</P>
<P>
O'CONNOR HAS MADE youth-oriented programs a priority throughout her political 
career, in part because she cannot have children of her own. "Everyone's dealt 
a deck of cards, and children didn't happen to be in mine," O'Connor says. "But 
I compensate for that. Being able to do something for kids is one of the real 
joys of this job." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor frequently visits the poor and victimized, serving as a kind of 
Florence Nightingale backed by the substantial resources of the government and 
the prestige of the mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
In July, when 9-year-old Joshua Garrett had his skull fractured by a teen-ager 
wielding a baseball bat from a passing car, O'Connor privately visited his 
hospital room, and later took Joshua and his mother home in her city car. 
</P>
<P>
There, they discovered that the family's apartment had been ransacked by 
burglars who left it a shambles. After tucking Joshua's mother, Theresa, into 
bed, O'Connor spent the next four hours straightening up the apartment -- 
washing dishes, sending her police escort out for pizza, buying groceries, 
making child-care arrangements for Garrett's children and demanding that the 
building manager fix Garrett's broken bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
"She took the time and effort to do something for my family," Theresa Garrett 
recalls. "She didn't have to do that. She didn't have to do that at all." 
</P>
<P>
This may be O'Connor at her best. She has personally painted a Boys Club 
wrecked by vandals and sat up for two days with a dying port commissioner. She 
has hauled trash, ladled food at shelters for the homeless and toured the city 
handing out Christmas gifts to shut-ins. 
</P>
<P>
In a locally celebrated and nationally publicized odyssey, O'Connor spent two 
days in 1988 living on San Diego's streets disguised as a transient. 
Accompanied by undercover police officers and two disguised reporters, she 
watched drug deals, picked through encampments in the canyons of Balboa Park 
and washed furniture at a shelter for the privilege of taking a shower. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's critics scorned the action as a publicity stunt, noting that the 
mayor's memo describing the tour focused on crime, drugs and filth, instead of 
homelessness. "You can't experience homelessness in two days on the street," 
says Frank Landerville, executive director of the Regional Task Force on the 
Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Connor credits her wanderings throughout the city and frequent police 
ride-alongs in the crack-infested sections of southeast San Diego for her 
knowledge of how San Diegans feel and what they need. "I know before the 
pollsters realize there's a problem," O'Connor says, "because I do that. I go 
out. I spend a lot of time on the streets and I get criticized for it. That's 
my style." 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't typical political behavior -- that's what confuses and perplexes a 
lot of people about Maureen," confidant Wolfsheimer says. "She takes her 
signals from what she picks up from talking to people at shopping malls or 
riding around with cops, not from polls or other politicians." 
</P>
<P>
'JUST SAY NYET' 
</P>
<P>
O'CONNOR LIKES TO say that the arts festival proved that San Diego had "come of 
age" culturally and perhaps, in some small way, further warmed U.S.-Soviet 
relations. "To see Frish the Clown (of the Moscow Circus) mixing with Ronald 
McDonald and Mickey Mouse, . . . it was wonderful," O'Connor gushed between 
bites of Russian food. 
</P>
<P>
But a Soviet clown holding hands with two walking corporate logos hardly marks 
a significant new chapter in glasnost. The arts festival, announced at 
O'Connor's January, 1988, State of the City address, once again set some San 
Diegans to wondering about O'Connor's priorities for the city. The project also 
conjured up recollections of Hedgecock's caustic dismissal of O'Connor in their 
1983 showdown as "a little rich girl with nothing better to do" than dabble in 
politics, someone better suited to organizing a party than to managing a major 
American city. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor threw herself, body and soul, into the festival like nothing else she 
has tackled during her tenure. Despite the appointment of two festival 
coordinators, the mayor controlled the show from start to finish, personally 
selecting the opening ceremony songs: "We Are the World" and "It's a Small 
World." 
</P>
<P>
Negotiating the labyrinthine Soviet bureaucracy, O'Connor persuaded the Kremlin 
Armory museum and U.S. billionaire Malcolm Forbes to lend the festival their 
collections of Faberge Imperial Eggs for a showing of 27 of the bejeweled 
artifacts. Two Soviet dramas, "Brothers and Sisters" and "Slingshot," were 
brought here for their U.S. premieres; for an opera production, the mayor chose 
Mussorgsky's masterpiece "Boris Godunov." 
</P>
<P>
The festival was a huge political gamble for O'Connor, who inaugurated the 
event without assurances that the public would attend. Moreover, she was asking 
the military-dominated city of San Diego to embrace the Soviets. In the era of 
Gorbachev, she was offering Czarist art. Some artists sniffed at the quality of 
the exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
To top it off, O'Connor set off howls when she asked the council to finance the 
festival with $3 million in city hotel taxes at a time when the sewer system, 
the roads and the police force were begging for funds. "Just Say Nyet" and 
"Homeless Children Can't Eat Faberge Eggs" bumper stickers were circulated. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbying the City Council with rare fervor, O'Connor won the public funding, 
plus an additional $500,000 from the San Diego Unified Port District, which 
Wolfsheimer heads. She rounded up more than $3 million in private 
contributions, including $1.4 million from Kroc and the Ronald McDonald 
Children's Charities, $250,000 from Helen Copley and $250,000 more from the 
James S. Copley Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a festival of astounding popularity and some rave reviews, 
particularly for the two dramas. In a Times poll conducted during the 
festival's final weekend, residents favored it by a 72% to 19% margin, and 33% 
said they or a family member had attended at least one event. Organizers 
reported that a total of 600,000 people attended during the festival's 22-day 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the extravaganza proved an artistic or financial success and how it 
will serve as Maureen O'Connor's legacy remain open questions. Her office 
maintains that the festival and the national publicity it generated have 
elevated San Diego's standing as a cultural center. Although the poll found 
residents refuted the mayor's notion that the festival demonstrated that San 
Diego had "come of age," San Diegans heartily welcomed O'Connor's proposal that 
similar festivals be held every three years, beginning in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor feels vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see the movie 'Field of Dreams?' " O'Connor asks. "That's what the 
arts festival was to me. It was my field of dreams. And the voice I heard was 
the voice of the people. 
</P>
<P>
"The critics were all waiting for me to fail. I heard that this was going to be 
my funeral. Well, they were wrong, and I knew they would be. Frankly, it just 
brought home a lesson I learned a long time ago in politics. If I hadn't tried 
to do all the things that my critics over the years have said couldn't be done, 
I'd probably still be back teaching phys ed. I listen to the people. And thanks 
to them, I've been under a very lucky star."

MARINES AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS ARE UNLIKELY ALLIES IN PROTECTING THE LARGEST 
UNDEVELOPED CHUNK OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
JAMES R. AICHELE spent 40 years in the Marine Corps, a career that spanned a 
world war, Korea and Vietnam. But ask him which amphibious assault was the most 
difficult to stage, and he talks about the day a California least tern almost 
brought the Marine Corps to its knees on its own beach at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a whole bunch of congressmen and dignitaries from all over coming in to 
view a large landing exercise," recalls Aichele, who was chief of staff at the 
time, back in the late '70s. "That landing is a big show for us every year, but 
a week before it was to happen, a woman biologist on base spotted the 
California least tern on the beach and ordered her people to start putting up 
barbed wire fence to keep the beach off-limits to us." The bird is on the 
federal endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, the former colonel is rankled by the memory. "I told her she 
couldn't fence off the whole damn beach because we had this big show in a week. 
It looked to me like the birds were just rummaging along the beach for food and 
hadn't begun to nest yet, and I was afraid the biologist was going to let them 
have the run of the whole beach. But she wouldn't back down. She said it was 
her job to protect them." 
</P>
<P>
Not to be outfoxed by a biologist, Aichele ordered his bulldozers to push 
natural beach debris down the beach, to lure the birds away from the planned 
attack site. The biologist was livid, Aichele says, but the war games were 
played for all to see as the relocated birds nestled in for the summer. 
Aichele, who retired in 1981, says he shouldn't be judged too harshly. After a 
particularly rough winter storm that left the beach slippery smooth, he took 
the same biologist's advice and ordered AMTRACS, ship-to-shore assault 
vehicles, to run up and down the strand to create new sand tracks so the least 
tern would have nesting ruts to call home. 
</P>
<P>
This sometimes antagonistic but strangely symbiotic relationship between 
military professionals and passionate environmentalists exists because Camp 
Pendleton, unique for the variety of combat situations it can simulate, is also 
one of the most varied wildlife refuges in Southern California. Both the 
Marines and the naturalists appreciate what they've got here: 196 square miles 
of beaches and bluffs, mesas and canyons, mountains and a free-flowing river. 
There is room enough to stage amphibious invasions, troop maneuvers and 
aircraft bombing runs -- and to support an estimated 731 species of plants and 
animals, 10 of them endangered. It's the largest undeveloped chunk of coastline 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
While the Marines inadvertently have turned a section of the base into one of 
the most hazardous toxic-waste sites in the country and sometimes touch off 
brush fires during training exercises, the environmentalists see them as allies 
of sorts in an escalating battle to protect the wild lands that remain. Given a 
choice between 36,000 Marines and the entrepreneurs who'd like to use Camp 
Pendleton as a toxic-waste landfill, an airport, a toll road or a yacht club, 
environmental groups -- and many San Diegans -- will take the Marines. Bombs 
and all. 
</P>
<P>
FROM THE WINDOW of a Huey helicopter, the sweep of Camp Pendleton looks like a 
landscape of early California. Stands of California oak stretch their limbs 
over broad expanses of lush meadow grasses. Thickets of brush and mosaics of 
cottonwoods, sycamores and alders stand alongside the undammed river. Willows 
and reeds frame the coastal estuary and marshes. Miles of sand dunes are 
anchored not by imported ice plant but by native grasses. By day, the sky 
belongs to golden eagles and hawks; by night, to owls. 
</P>
<P>
The site of the first Christian baptism in upper California and the one-time 
home of Pio Pico, the last Mexican governor to rule these parts, the Camp 
Pendleton tract was part of Rancho Santa Margarita -- one of the original 
Spanish land grants -- and later a successful cattle ranch. The base, founded 
in 1942, was named for retired Gen. Joseph H. Pendleton, a decorated Marine 
during World War I, who urged the Marine Corps to establish a West Coast 
training center even before the start of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Today, U.S. Marine Corps Base, Camp Joseph H. Pendleton, is as unsullied a 
piece of Southern California coast as you'll find. Winding through its southern 
portion is what environmentalists call the area's greatest natural treasure -- 
not its endangered species but the last free-flowing river in Southern 
California: the Santa Margarita River, which spends 17 of its 27 miles on the 
base. On the trail along the river bottom, a hiker is apt to come across 
beavers and deer, quail and dove, coyotes and bobcats, owls and mallards. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a mystique about this place, even among biologists," says Slader Buck, 
a civilian who works as the base's wildlife biologist and game warden, "because 
for years everyone ignored Pendleton when they did their wildlife surveys. Now, 
they're starting to take note, because we're the last remaining biological 
system in Southern California that reaches from the ocean to the coastal 
mountains." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more important to the 2.3 million residents of San Diego County, Camp 
Pendleton is a 17-mile-long militarized zone protecting them from the perceived 
bogyman of Los Angeles and Orange counties. They prize the base as a barrier to 
Los Angeles' sprawl southward and what they fear as the ultimate "Los 
Angelization" of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"For 90% of the people who drive along the Coast Highway through the base, Camp 
Pendleton is open space -- a time for us to take a deep breath and relax as we 
head home for San Diego, or to catch our breath before we dive into the 
compression -- the density, the noise, the smog -- of Orange County and Los 
Angeles," says Don Wood, president of Citizens Coordinate for Century 3, a 
respected San Diego-based urban-planning and environmental group. "It's only 
occasionally when you see the amphibious landing craft coming onto the beach, 
like a little Normandy diorama. Usually, all we see are just miles and miles of 
beaches and open space." 
</P>
<P>
The land's serenity is more relative than actual: It does, after all, house a 
busy community that includes a 600-bed naval hospital, five elementary schools, 
six Laundromats, a movie theater, a bowling alley, a golf course, horse riding 
stables, a bank, three Burger King restaurants and a McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, there's the 16,000-strong 1st Marine Division with its 3,000 
tactical vehicles, 50 tanks, a couple hundred World War II-era landing craft -- 
and 19 new Hovercraft that will take amphibious assaults into the 21st Century 
by traveling four times faster than their 40-year-old predecessors and by 
skimming up to 10 miles inland so troops won't even get their feet wet. There 
are 90 pistol and rifle ranges, 40 artillery positions and two bombing runs. 
Still, the base is a peaceful oasis contrasted with the furious building boom 
taking place nearby as housing developments rise daily in southern Orange 
County and northern San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
So treasured is this buffer that Citizens Coordinate for Century 3 persuaded 
U.S. Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) to sponsor legislation -- still being debated 
-- that would forever preserve Camp Pendleton as a national park or wilderness 
area should the Marine Corps ever pack up and leave. Some folks aren't waiting 
for them to leave and have proposed decidedly non-military uses of the base 
even as the military continues to occupy it. The base operates a Community 
Planning and Liaison Office simply to deal with the rash of proposals that 
would grab a piece of Pendleton, a little here, a little there. "Encroachment 
-- anything that would affect the routine and operation of this base -- is a 
dirty word around here," says Lt. Col. Ray Spears, who heads the office. "It's 
hard to convince people how badly we need this place, especially since we're 
getting along better with (Soviet leader Mikhail S.) Gorbachev." 
</P>
<P>
Spears' office has identified more than 50 so-called encroachment threats that, 
he says, would jeopardize the Marines' training mission. An Orange County 
group, looking to relieve crowding at John Wayne Airport, identified as one of 
six finalists -- but not the preferred candidate -- in its airport-site search 
a mesa on the base. Three state legislators are pushing legislation that would 
allow the counties of Orange, San Diego, Riverside and Imperial to form a 
regional agency to build an airport, and they propose Pendleton as the site. 
Entrepreneurs have suggested that a toxic-waste landfill be established here. 
Private developers in southern Riverside County want to build a private toll 
road across the base. A proposal that a liquefied-natural-gas tanker depot be 
built on Pendleton's coast was defeated in the late 1970s; still being 
discussed is the prospect of oil-drilling platforms off Pendleton's shoreline. 
And the City of Oceanside, looking to capitalize on the scheduled 1991 defense 
of the America's Cup in San Diego, wants to lease part of the military harbor 
for use as a private yacht club. 
</P>
<P>
THE MARINES cling to Camp Pendleton because no other base affords the corps a 
place to stage in symphony such a wide range of military maneuvers: F/A-18 
Hornets drop 500-pound bombs on target ranges. Giant Hovercraft attack the 
beach from the open sea at 45 miles per hour like giant, rubber-skirted water 
bugs. Thousands of young Marines scamper, hide and march over hills, through 
canyons and into woods. Artillerymen lob 95-pound shells from 155-millimeter 
howitzers. They do this in the wet cold of January and in the desert heat of 
September. Often they train at night, when the black of a moonless sky is 
suddenly broken by the pop of a bright flare, and red-yellow tracer bullets 
from machine guns flash like so many bottle rockets. 
</P>
<P>
But conducting large-scale troop maneuvers in the midst of this highly valued 
stretch of land has become increasingly complicated for the Marines. Besides 
staving off the many forces that want to appropriate the base's land, the 
Marines have had to cope with escalating environmental restrictions. Nearly 
every week plans for large troop maneuvers are submitted to the base's natural 
resources office, which reviews them for environmental impact and can hold up a 
proposed invasion site or battle. 
</P>
<P>
And, even without outside encroachment, the base commander, Brig. Gen. Richard 
H. Huckaby, has seen the space available to his troops diminish. Nearly half of 
the base's land, most notably along the river and its estuary, is off-limits to 
his troops. The state leases 2,000 acres for its San Onofre State Beach Park, 
next to the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, and additional land is used 
for agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
There is concern that still more land will be marked off-limits to protect the 
coyote thistle, a small, unspectacular weed that is a candidate for the 
endangered species list because it is being plowed under throughout Southern 
California but thrives in the hills of Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
The troops have become accustomed to modifying their maneuvers to accommodate 
wildlife. They joke about how they stop target practice when deer move through 
their shooting range. Bulldozers sent out to establish fire breaks to contain 
the frequent grass fires zigzag around an area where the endangered Stephen's 
kangaroo rat burrows in the ground. Instead of digging latrines that might 
pollute the ground water that supplies Camp Pendleton, troops in the field use 
1,000 portable toilet stalls that dot the landscape. Mechanics doing work on 
dented vehicles may only use one quart a day of special, infrared-resistant 
paint because merely opening the can pollutes the air. 
</P>
<P>
"This wouldn't be a problem at Twentynine Palms (where the Marine Corps have a 
larger base), because (San Bernardino County) doesn't have as strict 
air-quality laws," says Tom Zugsay, a civilian who is in charge of the 
environmental protection branch of Camp Pendleton's natural resources office. 
"But we're doing business in a county with one of the strictest 
air-quality-control standards around." 
</P>
<P>
The Marines maintain that despite their tanks, troops and howitzer shells, most 
of the land they use is in better environmental shape today than when they took 
it over. Says Huckaby: "If I were attacking the coast of California, I couldn't 
care less about the eggs of the least tern. But if I'm training here, I can 
accommodate them. It's the right thing to do. And it's the law. I personally 
consider myself a conservationist of the highest order. The community (off 
base) develops and destroys habitat all the time. We may become the only place 
where these critters can live and thrive." 
</P>
<P>
Still, environmentalists watch the Marines warily. "Military installations are 
among the worst polluters," says Carl Pope, deputy director of conservation for 
the Sierra Club in San Francisco. "The Department of Defense historically has 
been unwilling to comply with environmental standards." For example, last 
month, the EPA named seven bases in California, Nevada and Arizona to the 
agency's Superfund list of the nation's most potentially hazardous waste sites 
-- including Camp Pendleton, because of contaminated soil, and the Marine 
Corps' Barstow Logistics Base, where "substantial quantities" of solvent wastes 
were generated. 
</P>
<P>
Emily Durbin, a chairwoman of the county land-use subcomittee of the San Diego 
chapter of the Sierra Club and a director of the Friends of the Santa Margarita 
River, offers a favorable assessment of the Marine Corps' stewardship of the 
base's natural resources, but she says she can only give the Marines a "B" on 
their overall environmental report card, for two reasons. Tanks and troops 
crush grasses and compact the soils. And grass fires, Durbin complains, are far 
too common, typically sparked by flares, bombs or bullets. For a few days in 
October, for instance, three separate fires were burning on Camp Pendleton, 
including one that consumed nearly 10,000 acres and spilled over into the 
Cleveland National Forest. In 1985, a fire jumped the base's borders and burned 
several homes to the east, leading to multimillion-dollar claims against the 
government. (Some have been settled; others are still pending.) 
</P>
<P>
"But overall, they've been much more responsive than we might have expected in 
terms of resource protection," Durbin says. "Despite the fact that this is 
their West Coast amphibious landing-force practice grounds, for instance, they 
have protected the nesting spots on the beach for the California least tern." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. The black, gray and white bird spends its winters in Mexico but flies 
north for the summer, and the sands of Camp Pendleton have become its favorite 
West Coast nesting ground. Last year, 246 breeding pairs of least tern were 
counted on Pendleton's beaches and produced more than 365 fledglings. Today, a 
mile-long section of the upper beach is not only fenced off to keep Marines 
away from the small birds but is electrically wired to keep predators away from 
the nests and to prevent the chicks from wandering down to the AMTRAC speedway. 
(The fenced-off area was a concession by the Marine Corps when it sought the 
blessing of the California Coastal Commission to construct a beachfront 
Hovercraft Tarmac in 1983.) Other federally listed endangered birds nesting 
here include the peregrine falcon, the light-footed clapper rail and the least 
Bell's vireo, as well as two birds and a rodent that are on the state's 
endangered species list -- the California brown pelican, the Belding's savannah 
sparrow and the Stephen's kangaroo rat. 
</P>
<P>
"As more plants and animals become listed (as endangered species), and the more 
we do a better job in protecting those species here at Camp Pendleton, the more 
we become restricted in our own activities," says Lt. Col. Tony Pack, deputy 
chief of staff for facilities. "We are becoming a victim of our own success." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the biggest environmental problems on base stem from an era before 
respect for the land was widespread. One of the six sites targeted for cleanup 
by federal officials is an area alongside the landing strip where, back in the 
1950s and '60s, aviation fuel was purposely dumped and set afire for training 
exercises. "We didn't think anything was wrong with doing that back then," says 
Huckaby. "We know better now." 
</P>
<P>
Another contaminated spot is the agricultural utility area near the Santa 
Margarita River, where for years pesticide applicators were washed clean. A 
third is an old recycling and scrap yard -- resting grounds for everything from 
office desks to Jeeps to old power transformers whose cooling oils are 
contaminated by carcinogenic PCBs. Studies have shown the soil there to be 
contaminated by gasoline, oil, copper and zinc. The Marines, armed with $30 
million in Defense Department environmental-restoration funds, hope to have the 
scrap yard cleaned by 1996. More than 700 underground fuel tanks have been 
removed in recent years, at a cost of more than $2 million. Another 636 storage 
tanks are still underground -- half of them still used -- and the cost of 
removing them is estimated at between $10 million and $100 million. The base 
handles most of its wastes problems internally, with two landfills. But some 
items, such as lithium batteries that power communications systems in the 
field, have to be trucked to an incinerator in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Zugsay says the most ticklish problem is how to dispose of outdated 
pharmaceuticals. "We have large quantities of packaged medicines to support our 
field hospitals in combat. They have to be boxed and ready to go, so we can't 
leave them on shelves and rotate them as they get older." Officials are still 
trying to figure out how to handle the problem, since only a small share of the 
pharmaceuticals can be incinerated at the naval hospital on base. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Campo, who retired in 1987 after spending 11 years as Camp Pendleton's 
natural resources director, is familiar with its cleanup and conservation 
efforts. He's widely credited by community organizations, including the Sierra 
Club, for keeping the Marines environmentally honest. Campo, in turn, credits 
the string of commanding generals who -- nine times out of 10, he says -- took 
his advice. "A lot of people were surprised and chagrined that the military 
backed me up when I held up the delivery along the beach of the equipment for 
the San Onofre nuclear power station because of the least tern. A lot of people 
don't give due credit to the commanding generals for their support of the base 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
All in all, says Campo, the base "is in better condition now than when the 
Marines took it over in 1942. It had been overgrazed by cattle. Used and 
abused. But after the Marines came, the grass recovered, and the plants and 
shrubs started reseeding." The meadows of Case Springs, for instance, were as 
barren as an asphalt parking lot 50 years ago, when cattle were rounded up 
before being herded to railroad cars for shipment to market. Today the meadows 
are vibrant, with tall brown grasses touching the drooping branches of 
100-year-old oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
REDHEAD SLADER BUCK, in jeans and a flannel shirt, is standing 10 miles in from 
the coastline, atop 3,189-foot-high Margarita Peak, just outside the eastern 
border of Camp Pendleton. Farther to the east are the canyons of De Luz and the 
rural, northern San Diego community of Fallbrook, home to gentleman farmers, 
retirees and military families. Twenty miles behind him is Palomar Mountain, 
platform for the world's second-largest telescope. To the northeast, Buck 
points to the Cleveland National Forest and the San Mateo Canyon Wilderness 
area and, behind that, Mt. San Jacinto towering over Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
Buck turns his attention westward, back toward Pendleton. Just below him is 
Case Springs. This looks like a place for picnics, not war games. This is where 
the buffalo roam, thanks to the San Diego Zoo, which released its excess bison 
here in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, the herd grows. 
</P>
<P>
Over five weekends last August and September, Buck's staff supervised 100 
civilian hunters and several hundred Marines who, together, killed 154 deer, 
providing some of the most bountiful deer hunting in all the state. (Civilians 
can also camp on one of Pendleton's beaches by buying an annual permit, though 
they may be chased off by amphibious assaults.) More often, Buck keeps out 
poachers who would otherwise stalk Pendleton's 2,000 deer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier to get the Marine Corps to adhere to all the state and federal 
regulations than someone else because they know that if they don't take care of 
this place responsibly, they risk losing it," Buck says. "There is no species 
on base that you can't find elsewhere. But the difference is, Camp Pendleton is 
part of an entire wildlife corridor that stretches from the Pacific into the 
Cleveland National Forest. Elsewhere in Southern California, habitats are 
becoming fragmented, like little islands, and that eventually leads to genetic 
inbreeding, which weakens the species. But this is a large-enough area, that 
shouldn't occur here." 
</P>
<P>
He considers the alternatives that have been suggested for Pendleton. A 
regional airport . . . an amusement park . . . or how about a master-planned 
residential community -- a new town, a 21st Century Mission Viejo? "Pendleton 
Estates," quips Buck, marrying military place names to developers'. "Foxtrot 
Acres . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Buck gazes over the meadow. "Developers would love to get their hands on this 
place. This is what Westlake looked like before it was developed. This place is 
still virtually untouched. This place," he says, "is a gem."

ON THE RECORD: HALLELUJAH! AN ALTERNATIVE TO 'MESSIAH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has become a tradition for this column, at this time of year, to recommend 
some new recording of Handel's "Messiah" to avoid. 1989's Caveat of the Year 
goes to the version by London's excellent Taverner Choir and period-instrument 
Taverner Players under the direction of their founder, Andrew Parrott. Among 
the soloists are such stylistic paragons as soprano Emma Kirkby, countertenor 
James Bowman and bass David Thomas (EMI Angel 49802, two CDs). 
</P>
<P>
It has, however, all been done far more enliveningly and in similar scholarly 
vein by conductors John Eliot Gardiner (Philips), Ton Koopman (Erato) and 
Trevor Pinnock (Deutsche Grammophon). 
</P>
<P>
The blame lies with Parrott, who is fatally disinclined to cut loose in those 
numbers requiring some thunder and/or tension. In "Why do the nations . . . ," 
for instance, his plodding, four-square conducting keeps the music earthbound 
and soloist Thomas unnecessarily in suspense and short of breath. 
</P>
<P>
But there's more to the seasonal choral explosion than 'Messiah,' including two 
new recordings of the sublimely soothing Faure Requiem, both employing the 
original small-orchestra scoring, which is really the only way this music 
should be heard. 
</P>
<P>
The Requiem is lovingly sung by the boys and men of the Choir of King's 
College, Cambridge, with the English Chamber Orchestra, under Stephen Cleobury 
(EMI/Angel 49880). The solos are attended to by baritone Olaf Bar, who sings 
with warm, winning simplicity, and treble Richard Eteson, a King's chorister, 
sounding blessedly unlike a pre-pubescent hoot-owl. 
</P>
<P>
The Faure is generously paired with that other most inviting vision of the 
afterlife, the 1947 Requiem of Maurice Durufle, from the same dedicated forces, 
with mezzo-soprano Ann Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Faure receives hardly less sensitive, if cavernously recorded, treatment from 
the Corydon Singers, an immaculately tuned, mixed-voice group directed by 
Matthew Best with, once more, the English Chamber Orchestra (Hyperion 66292). 
Mary Seers is the sweet-voiced soprano, Michael George the rather ordinary 
baritone. 
</P>
<P>
The accompanying material, including the charming "Messe Basse" and the 
rapturous "Cantique de Jean Racine," is handsomely presented by Best and his 
chorus. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, BMG Classics (parent company of RCA records) offers on a pair of CDs 
(7760) that most gloriously theatrical sacred entertainment of the early 
Baroque, Claudio Monteverdi's 1610 "Vespro della Beata Vergine." 
</P>
<P>
This inspired edition enlists an octet of fine vocal soloists including 
sopranos Monique Zanetti and Gillian Fisher, whose ravishing flutings in the 
"Pulchra es" section are reason enough to acquire the set. The production is 
directed by Frieder Bernius. 
</P>
<P>
For something both offbeat and memorable, try Benjamin Britten's 1948 "Saint 
Nicolas," a marvel of inventive disingenuousness in the same vein as the 
composer's "Noye's Fludde." The 50-minute cantata deals not with the jolly, 
red-clad fat man who consorts with reindeer, but the miracles associated with 
his more-or-less historical progenitor, the fourth-century Bishop of Myra (in 
Turkey), protector of children. 
</P>
<P>
The present recorded performance (Hyperion 66333), its first in 35 years, 
features a gaggle of choruses -- childrens' and adult -- the English Chamber 
Orchestra and tenor Anthony Rolfe Johnson, gloriously bright-voiced in the 
title role. The conductor is, again, Matthew Best who keeps things both orderly 
and in motion. 
</P>
<P>
There's a bonus, too: Britten's ethereal "Hymn to Saint Cecilia" -- the text by 
W. H. Auden is music in itself -- for unaccompanied chorus, exquisitely done by 
the Corydon Singers.

THE JAZZ AFICIONADO'S HOLIDAY WISH LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traditionally, this space has been reserved, as the holiday season approaches, 
for gift recommendations of records or books. As a rule, they are dealt with 
separately, but this year the proliferation of jazz literature and CDs has made 
it possible to suggest several matched sets, in which a given artist is 
well-represented both on record and in a recent addition to the bookshelf. 
</P>
<P>
"The Benny Goodman Yale Archives, Vol. I." Music Masters CIL 60142Z. 
</P>
<P>
"Benny Goodman and the Swing Era" by James Lincoln Collier (Oxford University 
Press: $22.95). 
</P>
<P>
Three days before his death in 1986, Benny Goodman donated his memorabilia and 
many master tapes to the music library archives at Yale. Vol. I is of rare 
interest, spanning 1955-86 and taking in live sessions (at the Rainbow Grill, 
Basin Street East and the Brussels World's Fair) along with several studio 
groups. Aside from two pieces by Bobby Gutesha, a Yugoslavian composer, these 
are mostly retreads of material Goodman recorded often before, but the great 
diversity of personnel provides for constant surprises: next up may be Teddy 
Wilson or Roland Hanna or Dave McKenna on piano, Flip Phillips or Zoot Sims or 
Paul Quinichette on tenor, etc. The maestro is in generally impeccable form. 
</P>
<P>
The Goodman biography succeeds, despite the extensive shelf of material already 
available, in shedding new light. Collier has done his research well. Moreover, 
he deals very fairly with Goodman's strange personality and evokes the 
Zeitgeist of the pre-swing and swing eras. This is far superior to his too 
often negatively slanted Armstrong and Ellington studies, and may well stand up 
as the definitive Goodman reference work. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly Blues." Lionel Hampton. Music Masters CIJD 60168 K. 
</P>
<P>
"Hamp" by Lionel Hampton with James Haskins (Warner Books: $19.95). 
</P>
<P>
Because Hampton is seldom heard in an intimate setting, the two 1988 quintet 
dates here are of special interest. The title is misleading; only three of the 
nine cuts are actually blues, but Hampton's unflagging energy and inspiration 
are consistently on display. The rhythm sections are not up to his 
requirements, despite some generally helpful piano by Bobby Scott. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with ghost-written autobiographies is that the authors seldom seem 
to read them. Haskins reconstructs Hampton's childhood in Louisville and 
Chicago, his early bandleading career and subsequent discovery by Benny 
Goodman, but his research is badly flawed. He has Hampton saying, "I played 
vibes on 'Evil Gal Blues' and 'Salty Papa Blues' " (with Dinah Washington), 
when in fact he played nothing on either. Worse, Haskins has Hampton making LPs 
with his own band in 1944, five years before LPs existed. Still, the story of 
Hampton's late wife steering him relentlessly and acquisitively into fame and 
millions (which he has since multiplied) makes for fascinating reading. 
</P>
<P>
"At the Jazz Band Ball" Eddie Condon/Muggsy Spanier/Bud Freeman. RCA Bluebird 
6752-2-RB. 
</P>
<P>
"Crazeology" by Bud Freeman as told to Robert Wolf (University of Illinois 
Press: $15.95). 
</P>
<P>
Starting with two early, obscure Condon cuts (with Jack Teagarden as vocalist), 
the traditionalist CD proceeds to the classic 1939 sessions by cornetist 
Spanier, among them the blues "Relaxin' at the Touro," named for the New 
Orleans hospital where he came close to death in 1938. Even more interesting 
are the final four cuts by Bud Freeman's Summa Cum Laude octet, with Pee Wee 
Russell, Condon and Max Kaminsky. Freeman's was the only tenor sax sound to 
achieve, in those days, a sound and style as distinctly personal as Coleman 
Hawkins'. "The Eel," his original blues, is a miniature masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman's use of a ghost writer is curious, since he had already written two 
books without help. With a foreword by Studs Terkel, he tells his story 
succinctly (only 90 pages of actual text), recalling frankly and incisively 
everyone from Bix Beiderbecke and Louis Armstrong to Benny Goodman ("Working 
for Benny was the most miserable experience of my life"). Freeman, the world 
traveler, now back in his native Chicago, is still playing at 83. 
</P>
<P>
"New Life (Dedicated to Max Gordon)" Thad Jones/Mel Lewis. A &amp; M CD 0810. 
</P>
<P>
"Barney, Bradley and Max" by Whitney Balliett (Oxford University Press: 
$19.95). 
</P>
<P>
The reissue of an album made in 1976, when the Jones/Lewis band was at its 
creative zenith (aided on some cuts by a French horn section and tuba), offers 
a reminder of how valuable Max Gordon was in keeping this ensemble alive 
through a series of weekly dates at his Village Vanguard. The originals by 
Jones (also by Jerry Dodgion and Cecil Bridgewater) are peppered with vital 
solos. The notes on the CD require several magnifying glasses to be legible, 
but forget it; the music speaks grandiloquently for itself. 
</P>
<P>
Max Gordon is the subject, along with Barney Josephson and Bradley Cunningham, 
in the title of Whitney Balliett's latest collection of pieces (all three 
bonifaces died within a year or so before the book was assembled). Balliett 
brings them vividly back to life, alongside portraits of Buddy de Franco 
(previously unpublished), Goodman, Charlie Parker and 10 others. Written 
between 1971 and 1987, these evocative essays make one regret that the author 
appears so rarely in the New Yorker these days. 
</P>
<P>
If Balliett is second to none in his field, Gene Lees is second only to 
Balliett. His "Singers and the Song," just reissued in paperback (Oxford 
University Press: $8.95), begins with a wonderfully witty and perceptive 
chapter on how to write (and how not to write) lyrics, proceeding therefrom to 
examinations of the artistry of Johnny Mercer, Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra and 
others. The final chapter is an intriguing autobiographical account of Lees' 
trip to Cologne to record an album with Sarah Vaughan and Lalo Schifrin. 
</P>
<P>
Lees wrote the foreword for Doug Ramsey's "Jazz Matters: Reflections on the 
Music and Some of Its Makers" (University of Arkansas Press: $22.95), a 
miscellany of generally perceptive pieces on dozens of jazzmen. Some of the 
older essays from the 1960s have diminished in value, but Ramsey is a sensitive 
and entertaining writer.

RECORD RACK: 'HEALER': JUST AN ECHO OF THE BOOGIEMASTER;

<TEXT>
<P>
Pairing the venerable boogiemaster with admirers ranging from Carlos Santana 
and Bonnie Raitt to Los Lobos and Robert Cray was a great idea in theory . . . 
but not in practice. The performances are lethargic, and the decision to drench 
Hooker's voice in echo was a severe miscalculation. The title track sounds like 
soft-focus Santana; "Think Twice Before You Go" is a limp attempt at one of Los 
Lobos' roadhouse boogies; and Cray's contribution to "Baby Lee" is so anonymous 
you can't even identify him. Only the collaborations with Bonnie Raitt and 
George Thorogood squeeze out some sparks.

RECORD RACK: JAZZY JEFF, FRESH PRINCE DELIVER CINEMATIC CLARITY;

<TEXT>
<P>
Clean-cut and middle-class are not words typically used to describe most young 
rappers, but this duo has been saddled with them, thanks to last year's 
crossover smash "Parents Just Don't Understand," a comical, adventure-packed 
tale about joy-riding in Daddy's Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
The two are back with a slightly more profanity-laced perspective, but their 
descriptive powers have the same cinematic clarity -- and something about the 
Fresh Prince's rap style still suggests that he was one of those joke-telling, 
motor-mouthed kids in high school capable of forcing a teacher into early 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas most rappers fall into the LL Cool J / Kool Moe Dee mode of proclaiming 
how big, bad and infallible they are, Jeff and Prince are just as likely to 
come across as a hapless duo who attract bad luck ("All That Glitters"), odd 
encounters ("Twilight Zone") and Gucci-clad gold diggers ("You Got It"). Their 
saving grace is the wiseacre sense of humor that infuses cuts such as "I Think 
I Can Beat Mike Tyson" and "The Men of Your Dreams," in which the Fresh Prince 
attempts to woo an older woman by proclaiming, "Any man can look and see where 
the curves are / It takes a real man to find where the nerves are." 
</P>
<P>
With "Too Damn Hype," the team closes the album on a dance-oriented, down 'n' 
dirty (well, down 'n' slightly disheveled) note. Not a heavyweight effort, but 
a smart and funny one.

NO DICE: Gearing up for a couple of local concert dates, heavy-metal comic 
extraordinaire Sam Kinison has been making the rounds, stopping in at the China 
Club Monday night (where he roared through a particularly venomous rendition of 
"Wild Thing") and -- amazingly -- showing up at 7:45 a.m. for a chat with 
KLOS-FM morning brats Mark &amp; Brian. The highlights: Kinison denied a report 
that he had his bodyguards beat up a loudmouth at a recent Don Henley concert 
("It was one of my fans -- when they threw him out, he yelled 'We got him 
S-A-A-A-M!!!"). He also did not deny having an affair with Jessica Hahn, took a 
call from a 4-year-old fan (who sang his version of "Wild Thing") and helped 
out a young listener in trouble with his folks by phoning his mom and wooing 
her, Kinison-style, by suggesting that he drop by with a bottle of vodka and "a 
thousand milligrams of Valium." But Kinison really got revved up at the mention 
of vile-comedy rival Andrew Dice Clay, whom he gleefully mimicked ("Hickory 
dickory dock, I'm the new comic trying to take over rock, I stole my image from 
Sam, I'm all a big scam"), ridiculed ("I remember Andy when he was doing John 
Travolta tributes") and scorned ("It's a bitter war. I hope he experiences 
death by cancer from the inside. I hope his stomach explodes! AWWWWGGHHHH!!"). 
</P>
<P>
We figure the ball is in Dice's court now. When Mark &amp; Brian offered 
Kinison a pair of tickets to Clay's Forum show this week, he bellowed: "I 
WOULDN'T WIPE MY WINDSHIELD WITH THEM!!!"

BLACK MAGIC: Christmas is a time of tradition, even in heavy-metal circles. So 
we were cheered to see that headbanger-faves Anthrax is reviving a tradition of 
their own -- returning to their Brooklyn club roots this weekend to play under 
the assumed name of Satan's Lounge Band. (Tipper Gore, please relax -- it's a 
reference to an old Bill Murray "Saturday Night Live" routine, not a satanic 
endorsement.) The shows, scheduled for Friday and Saturday, will take place at 
Brooklyn's L'Amour club. . . . Meanwhile, Aerosmith just opened its U.S. tour 
in Charleston, W.Va., with L.A. dates due sometime early in 1990. (When the 
band played London's Hammersmith Odeon recently, it was joined by Whitesnake's 
David Coverdale, who hopped on stage and crooned "I'm Down" with the group.) . 
. . Blues fans take note: Roomful of Blues will be in town tonight at the 
Palomino Club. . . . And if you're staying home, you can hear blues concerts 
every Tuesday on "Bluesstage," which airs from 11 p.m. to midnight on KPCC-FM 
(89.3). This week the show features performances by pianists Charles Brown and 
Dr. John, while the Dec. 19 show offers Guitar Slim and Son Seals.

I read with interest "The Rise and Fall of Dr. Boggs," by Doug Smith (Oct. 29), 
and was not wholly surprised at the response from some of his former patients. 
It amazes me that the public continues to revere the physician as some sort of 
abstract God; unfortunately, many physicians also view themselves thusly. As 
someone who works with MDs on a daily basis, I adhere to the belief that these 
are moral men and women who run the gamut of ethical agendas and technical 
expertise; corrupt individuals can be seen operating in the same forum as those 
whose respect and admiration is well-deserved. 
</P>
<P>
When choosing a physician, as when dealing with any consumer issue, it would be 
advisable not to trust blindly, and remember that no allegiance to any 
individual need be permanent.

An employer who is flexible enough to allow employees to be part of their 
families will be rewarded with many benefits, including loyalty. All 
institutions experience times of hardship, and during such times those who feel 
a kinship with the workplace will stand by their employers while the others 
head out the door. The ability to occasionally work at home and have flexible 
hours is what most of us need to succeed on the Daddy Track and in our careers.

LORD OF THE RINK

<TEXT>

Jerry Crowe's "Lord of the Rink" (Oct. 1) leads one to believe that the Kings 
had no accomplishments before Wayne Gretzky and Bruce McNall. These "perennial 
losers" did produce a league scoring champion, Lady Byng and Calder Trophy 
winners and the Triple Crown Line -- not to mention the first miracle playoff 
defeat of Edmonton. I'm glad that new crowds are sold on the team, but as a fan 
since 1967 I'd like to see a more generous view of the Kings' long tradition 
and a loyalty to the jersey, old and new.

Ideal parent-child time allocation will come with the six-hour, four-day work 
week. Meanwhile, there are all sorts of time-bending tricks to live by now. 
Properly utilized youth groups (such as Boy Scouts and Indian Guides) can offer 
team daddying by matching skills and time available to maximize children's 
growth and development. Back when I was parenting, athletic dads coached 
sports. "Nerd" dads (that was me) set up the butter-making, rifle-range, 
blood-typing, Mother's Day-corsage, ant-farm and secret-code projects. 
Weekend-off dads handled hiking, fishing and camping. Night-working dads led 
the museum historical site and factory trips after school.

Those on the Daddy Track have the women's movement to thank for encouraging men

THE PROTEST AGAINST 'THE NORMAL HEART' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like so many AIDS pieces in The Times, Koehler's article is blatant homosexual 
propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that the producers of "The Normal Heart" had every right to present 
the play in Springfield, Mo. I also believe that local citizens had every right 
to organize against it. 
</P>
<P>
When have you seen a play produced for the truly innocent victims of AIDS, such 
as those who received tainted blood? 
</P>
<P>
It is fitting that the article's final word is "homophobia." After all, isn't 
this the standard epithet used against those who dissent from the AIDS "party 
line"?

THE PROTEST AGAINST 'THE NORMAL HEART' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Robert Koehler's Dec. 3 article " 'Normal Heart' Stirs Up the Heartland," on 
the protests surrounding the production of "The Normal Heart" on the campus of 
Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield, Mo.: 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Kenneth Gillming and the warrior sheep of his Citizens Demanding 
Standards warn us to "come back to morals, or the country is in deep trouble." 
The kind of morals the Reverend seems to tout are ones where you: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Burn people's houses if you disagree with their taste in theater. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Incinerate their pets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Threaten (anonymously, of course) to burn the house of a play's director. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Try to blackmail a school by threatening to create funding problems if a 
play is not canceled or at least censored to the liking of a state 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And, oh gosh, just trample on the Bill of Rights in general. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Gillming, sir, the morals of the country are just fine. It's yours that are 
"in deep trouble."

GERARD SCHWARZ: CLASS BENEATH THE BATON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Martin Bernheimer's "Confessions of a Talented Workaholic," Nov. 26: 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, Gerard Schwarz led the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra in a 
program of Strauss and Haydn at UCLA. Claudio Arrau was the soloist, performing 
works both immediately before and after the intermission. 
</P>
<P>
After completing the Strauss "Burleske," Schwarz followed Arrau onto the stage 
for their bows. Schwarz immediately noticed that the volume of applause rose 
perceptibly as he appeared. He stopped in his tracks and started to applaud 
Arrau -- focusing the attention of the audience upon the soloist. 
</P>
<P>
After the intermission, Arrau returned to the piano, to the applause of the 
audience. Schwarz? He deftly weaved his way from the back of the orchestra and 
took his position on the podium. 
</P>
<P>
Class. Real class.

BILL STOUT'S PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF L.A. BROADCAST NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He was the Edward R. Murrow of my generation. A newsman's newsman. 
</P>
<P>
I worked in the same CBS building as Bill Stout for the past 12 years. Our 
communication consisted only of brushing shoulders and passing casual hellos, 
but he gave you pride you worked for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
We lost part of Bill Stout with his illness in 1987. But only on the outside. 
His pace measurably slowed, his facial coloring was chalky. But what counts 
inside never lost a beat. His biting commentaries still stung, and his writing 
still made lasting impression. 
</P>
<P>
A part of CBS has moved on, has been lost to the ages. 
</P>
<P>

 Stout, a commentator for KCBS Channel 2, died in Los Angeles Dec. 1. In 1987, 
he suffered a major heart attack.

DOG BISCUITS

WHAT ARE MADE of wheat flour, rye flour, cornmeal, nine grains, milk, safflower 
oil, molasses, eggs, yeast and salt, come in a pretty little bag with a picture 
on the front and look like adorable bones? If you don't know the answer, your 
dog wants to know the reason why. 
</P>
<P>
Buster's Biscuits are the very latest in doggy food. They are hand-made at the 
brand-new The Bakery on Melrose, which also makes a large line of foods fit for 
human consumption. These include rather delicious cookies, croissants, quiches, 
scones and elaborate cakes and tortes. They also bake a line of sugarless 
goodies. Does your dog care? Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
What he undoubtedly will want to know, however, is that humans have been known 
to fall for this particular brand of dog biscuit. Why not? Everything in them 
is good, they have a slightly salty, vaguely nutty flavor with deep molasses 
undertones, and they are delightfully chewy. And they are so distinctive 
looking that when put out with the crackers and the cheese on a cocktail tray, 
they make an unbeatable conversation piece. 
</P>
<P>
And if the conversation goes like this -- "Eat these things? Are you crazy?" 
you needn't despair. Buster's Biscuits can always go to the dogs -- who really 
love them. 
</P>
<P>
 Buster's Biscuits are $2.95 at The Bakery on Melrose, located at 7261 Melrose 
Ave., Los Angeles (213) 934-4493.

THE SCOOTER

<P>
THE FIRST GENERATION of office computers -- with the keyboard integrated with 
the screen -- condemned office workers to an updated Dickensian servitude. For, 
as studies of clerical workers with carpal tunnel syndrome show, typing hour 
after hour at a desk-height keyboard, with wrists raised higher than the 
fingers, puts unnatural stress on the wrists. 
</P>
<P>
Lowering the keyboard below desk height, with wrists parallel to fingertips, 
alleviates the stress. One way to assume such a position is by resting the 
keyboard on your lap or thighs while leaning back, with your feet on the desk. 
But no one wants to maintain such a sprawling posture all day long; besides, in 
a workplace it doesn't look very businesslike. 
</P>
<P>
So some office furniture manufacturers offer articulated keyboard drawers that 
attach underneath the desk surface and slide out, thereby placing the keyboard 
just above the user's lap. But the keyboard drawer have disadvantages: In time 
they may become wobbly, and they hog critical knee space under the desk -- you 
can't cross your legs. 
</P>
<P>
To the rescue, in 1985, came office furniture maker Herman Miller's 
free-standing computer-keyboard Scooter, designed by Jack Kelley, who is based 
in Spring Lake, Mich. His Scooter is height- and tilt-adjustable and doubles as 
a stand for a dictionary or sewing machine, or even as a speaker's lectern. 
With the optional wire rack, it also functions as a music stand. When not in 
use, the lightweight Scooter "scoots" under the desk, out of sight. 
Interestingly, the Scooter lacks casters. Instead, Kelley opted for 
low-friction polyethylene pads that glide easily across a floor or carpet. "I 
wanted to keep the base low to the floor, so you won't kick or stumble over 
it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always specialized in responsive furniture that changes and accommodates 
to the user," says Kelley. For instance, in the mid-60s, he helped develop 
Herman Miller's Action Office, the world's first panel-based systems furniture 
(the kind we now see in large offices everywhere, made of easily reconfigured, 
different-height wall panels and various desk surfaces, shelves and storage 
compartments). For its part, the Scooter, says Kelley, is for the computer user 
"who doesn't want to be positioned in a sedentary posture, who wants to be able 
to stand up and sit down and swivel and walk around -- to be fully in control 
of his environment. I'm anti-everything that doesn't respond to the user's 
will."

 About $280, retail, at Herman Miller Office Pavilion, 2575 McCabe Way, Irvine, 
(714) 975-8700, and Herman Miller Inc., Pacific Design Center, 8687 Melrose

AMERICAN EMPIRE FURNITURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM BURCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FOR MANY YEARS, American 19th-Century furniture has been overlooked, while 
furniture of earlier periods commands the highest prices at auction. Empire 
furniture, in particular, has never been popular. This is hard to understand, 
since the furniture itself, dating from the 1820s and the 1830s, is graceful 
and well designed and uses the finest mahogany and rosewood veneers. It is far 
simpler -- and often more appealing -- than the French Empire and English 
Regency furniture upon which it is based. Ormolu is hardly ever used, and all 
excess has been avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Of the cabinetmakers who specialized in the style, the best known, and 
certainly the finest craftsman, was Duncan Phyfe (1768-1854) of New York City. 
Born in Scotland, he came to America at the age of 16 and served as an 
apprentice to a cabinetmaker in Albany. By 1792, he had made his way to New 
York City, where he established a highly successful workshop. Elegance and 
simplicity were his trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
His name is forever associated with Empire furniture, a style based on European 
models but adapted to American tastes. Fine examples of the style can be seen 
today in the Old Merchant's House on East 4th Street in New York City, now a 
museum and almost perfectly restored to the original condition that existed 
when the Treadwell family bought the house in 1835. During the early 19th 
Century, quantities of sofas, chairs, beds and pedestal tables were made in the 
Empire style, along with the popular window seats (really small sofas, designed 
to fit into a window alcove) -- all variations of the elegant forms developed 
by Phyfe. At the time, French influence was pronounced, because many pattern 
and design books from Paris found their way to the United States after the 
birth of the new nation. There were also many emigre cabinetmakers like 
Charles-Honore Lannuier of New York and Anthony Quervelle of Philadelphia, and 
there was a considerable amount of imported furniture on hand, the result of 
increased trade between France and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In its American form, Empire furniture is not easy to find but, when available, 
can often be bought at bargain prices. At auction in 1988, it sold for far less 
than other American furniture. A Federal carved mahogany sofa and a carved 
window seat, for example -- both attributed to the shop of Duncan Phyfe -- sold 
at Christie's for $49,500 and $26,400, respectively. During the same year, 
however, a pair of American Empire side chairs, c. 1835, brought $15,000. These 
were handsome and gracefully designed pieces whose lines blend well with 
contemporary decor. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for Empire furniture at Panache, Vivian Farren, Edwin-Anthony, all in Los 
Angeles; Richard Gould in Santa Monica; Carlyle Eubank in Beverly Hills; 
Richard Yeakel and Nicholson's Antiques, both in Laguna Beach; Jay's Antiques 
in Pasadena, and The Snow Goose in La Jolla.

CHILD'S PLAY: AROUND HOME;

SAFE POOLS

THE DROWNING OF a child is the swimming pool owner's greatest fear. Active 
toddlers and preschoolers, who mistakenly believe they can swim, are 
particularly at risk. The fencing around most pools is intended to keep out 
trespassers. Removable perimeter pool fences and pool covers, though not a 
substitute for adult supervision, are a wise safety measure. 
</P>
<P>
Fencing is made of poly-coated nylon mesh (it comes in black, which is most 
transparent, white or beige), which is too fine for a child to climb on. Fences 
come in 3 1/2- or 4-foot heights, with supporting aluminum poles and gates or 
points of entry spaced regularly around the perimeter of the fences. Poles are 
anchored in the decking about two feet from the edge of the pool. A section or 
two can be opened up or removed to permit access for swimming or maintenance. 
For parties or special events, the entire fence can be taken down in 15 minutes 
or less, depending on the size of the pool, and set back up again in about the 
same amount of time. Typical cost for installation ranges from $1,500 to 
$2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Manual or motorized safety pool covers provide a horizontal, rather than 
vertical, barrier to entry. (Consumers should look for covers that meet federal 
safety standards; other covers can be simply intended to catch debris.) The 
reinforced vinyl cover slides on a track attached to the decking. Care must be 
taken, however, to prevent accumulation of water on top of the cover from 
rainfall. Typical cost ranges from $1,000 to $6,000, depending on the size and 
shape of the pool and whether the cover is motorized. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers and distributors of removable pool fencing and pool covers sell 
and install their products throughout Southern California. Contact Roll-A-Way 
Protective Pool Fence Co., (818) 347-2833, (213) 655-7151 or (714) 670-2977;

SCHOOLS COMPARE LOCAL DRUG WARS AS U.S. THREATENS TO CUT AID TO PERMISSIVE 
DISTRICTS

<P>
South Carolina school principal Ben Nesbit said he became suspicious when two 
students who had been suspended for using drugs later passed urine tests. 
</P>
<P>
"We found out a couple of weeks ago that there's a chemical that washes drugs 
out of the system," said Nesbit, of Spring Valley High School in Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
"The students use it full time, washing out their systems and being tested, all 
the time being high." 
</P>
<P>
The street name of the purging agent is Golden Seal, said District of Columbia 
teacher Leroy Lewis Jr., explaining that it also is popular with students in 
the capital. 
</P>
<P>
This is proof that the campaign against drugs in schools is serious and must be 
waged in a no-nonsense but flexible manner, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids recognize all the problems of the system," said Lewis, who teaches 
government at Spingarn Senior High. "They know how to circumvent us better than 
we know how to plan." 
</P>
<P>
The effort to keep youngsters away from drugs has evolved from Nancy Reagan's 
mere "Just Say No" slogan to a Bush Administration threat to end federal aid to 
schools, colleges and universities that fail to prove they have strict 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
The tougher approach reflects a growing concern. Statistics indicate that 5% of 
high school seniors drink alcohol daily and more than 60,000 adolescents ages 
12 or 13 have tried cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"Young people show a faster propensity to develop an addiction, and the damage 
by addiction can be more permanent," said Doug Hall of the National Parents' 
Resource Institute for Drug Education. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government is expected to spend about $500 million disseminating 
anti-drug information in this fiscal year, about $180 million more than the 
year that ended Sept. 30. In 1986, only $3 million was allocated for drug 
education. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all high schools and 87% of elementary schools offer some sort of 
anti-drug lectures. The new federal strategy says that school-based prevention 
programs should be backed up with tough policies on use, possession and 
distribution of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Success Hard to Measure 
</P>
<P>
Schools are trying a variety of approaches, with no clear trend emerging. 
Success is hard to measure, since so many of the approaches are new. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, football players' urine is tested. Illinois and Delaware laws allow 
spot searches of students, and Delaware plans to take drug-sniffing dogs into 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
In Jefferson County, Ky., schools notify police of every drug incident, suspend 
students for six to 10 days for possession or use, and transfer repeat 
offenders. The Pittsburgh Board of Education has decided that any student 
convicted of trafficking in or possessing drugs, on or off school property, 
will be subject to expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
"Drug Free Zone" near public and private schools in Prince Georges' County, 
Md., warn that anyone convicted of possessing or distributing drugs within 
1,000 feet of a schoolyard could face up to 40 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Education officials estimate that perhaps 25 states have some sort of similar 
programs or laws. 
</P>
<P>
"We see more expulsions and suspensions for use because it's against the law," 
said James Better, staff director of the Education Department's Drug-Free 
Schools Recognition Program, "but most schools have referral and re-entry 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
At the local level, Education Department officials estimate that 73% of 
America's 16,490 school districts have written drug policies. Of these, more 
than 90% involve notifying parents and/or police, and suspension or counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Most major education groups avoid advocating specific policies for schools. At 
most they offer general guidelines, like those jointly developed by the 
American Assn. of School Administrators, the National Assn. of School Nurses 
and the National Education Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"We have problems when the feds try to impose decisions on the locals, so 
national groups avoid doing the same thing," said Lew Armistead of the National 
Assn. of Secondary School Principals. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, vice president of the National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug 
Education (PRIDE) in Atlanta, said: "We don't believe in dealing with these 
people as criminals. You really can't incarcerate your way out of a drug 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Hall pointed to statistics that say "school buildings or campuses are one of 
the least popular places" for students to use or distribute drugs. Also, he 
said, students tend to use drugs at night and on weekends, not at school. 
</P>
<P>
"PRIDE supports treatment on demand," said Hall, "but the problem is, it's 
difficult to draw the line on whether the school is responsible or the 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
Nesbit insisted: "It is a school problem, because (students) can't learn when 
they are stoned. They can't learn when they're dead. They can't learn when 
they're in the hospital. We're going to be paying for their rehabilitation 
forever and ever, because so many people are hooked." 
</P>
<P>
Nesbit said that he makes use of grass-roots approaches such as "sending out 
letters of complaints to local liquor stores that sell alcohol to minors" or 
encouraging suspension of users and automatic expulsion of sellers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the District of Columbia's policies, Lewis offers early-morning 
tutoring to students who want help with schoolwork and "to talk about what's 
going on with them, with somebody they want to trust." 
</P>
<P>
Jenlane Gee, a teacher from Modesto, Calif., complained that the government's 
efforts have ignored elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
Gee, who teaches third grade at Christine Sipherd School, said that equal 
emphasis should be placed on younger pupils because studies show that children 
usually decide between the third and fifth grades whether they will try alcohol 
or other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Nesbit added that simply talking -- or acting -- tough won't stop drug use. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a hard line" emerging in the schools, he said, "but there's no 
comprehensive policy that helps kids to make good decisions about their future, 
their bodies and their values."

<P>
As the third generation of his family to earn a living from the rich shellfish 
beds of Long Island Sound, Terry Backer grew up well-versed in the language of 
the sea. 
</P>
<P>
As spoken by his father and grandfather, it was an ancient language, as 
timeless and salty as the currents and tides. 
</P>
<P>
In Backer's lifetime, that has changed. New words -- petroleum hydrocarbons, 
bacterial effluvium, polychlorinated biphenyls -- have seeped into the 
fisherman's vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
"As a child," said the 36-year-old Backer, "I would yell at people not to throw 
things in the water. I've been hollering at my dad since I was 8 years old for 
throwing cigarette butts or soda cans overboard. It just struck me that they 
didn't belong. 
</P>
<P>
"Dad would say, 'You can't compare a soda can to 300 million pounds of sewage.' 
The hell you can't. It's the exact same philosophy at work." 
</P>
<P>
If a man takes offense at a stray cigarette butt, how does he feel about PCBs 
in his bluefish? If he finds floating soda cans an affront, how does he cope 
with petroleum hydrocarbons? 
</P>
<P>
Terry Backer has coped by learning a new language, peppered with such terms as 
"fax machine," "environmental litigation" and "regulatory process." 
</P>
<P>
The time once spent fishing for oysters and pulling lobster traps is now given 
to tracking polluters and battling developers. Evenings once devoted to family 
are taken up with a steady agenda of speaking engagements at civic clubs. 
</P>
<P>
'The Family Farm' 
</P>
<P>
Terry Backer, Long Island Sound fisherman, has become Terry Backer, Long Island 
Soundkeeper, an officious title for a $400-a-week job that carries no badge, no 
benefits and no illusions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not naive enough to think that anything I do will have any immediate 
effect. It's a long-term thing. I don't think I can change the world. But I do 
need to start. We're talking about the family farm." 
</P>
<P>
The "farm" is 1,300 square miles of water rimmed by 570 miles of coastline, 
home to 5 million people. 
</P>
<P>
"The population is constantly shifting to get closer to the shoreline," said 
Michael Ludwig, a Connecticut-based ecologist with the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration. "Easily between 300 and 500 projects a year are 
proposed for Long Island Sound. Even in this glutted market, it's still the 
most desirable real estate in the world." 
</P>
<P>
The man who keeps watch has an eighth-grade education, a bad back, a wife, two 
young sons and a sense of urgency. He also has "hands-on, feet-wet experience, 
and an intimate knowledge of Long Island Sound," neither of which can be found 
in a textbook. "Maybe the heart is more what this job needs than the book," 
Backer said. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so, agreed the directors of the nonprofit Long Island Soundkeepers Fund, 
who chose him over college-educated applicants. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows more about the water than most marine biologists we deal with," said 
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., clinical professor at Pace University School of Law and 
supervising attorney for the Hudson River Fishermen's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"Terry knows when there's stuff missing. He has seen species disappear, acres 
of yield grass, smelt. He can say there used to be blue crabs here but there 
aren't anymore. He has an institutional memory that goes back three 
generations." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many fishermen, who have accepted the sound's decline and taken 
part-time jobs to supplement their income, "Terry's never accepted it," Kennedy 
said. "He feels for the resource. He loves it. And he's decided to make a stand 
and fight for it." 
</P>
<P>
Making a stand often means making enemies. Backer has been called everything 
from extortionist to ambulance-chaser by elected officials throughout the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
"He goes into town board meetings where everybody hates him, the wealthiest 
people in these towns will be screaming at him, and he'll state his arguments 
and fight with them," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Developers hate him because one of the big battles is against shoreline 
development that requires marinas; marinas require dredging, which Terry 
opposes. Municipalities hate him because he's sued every municipality from New 
Haven to New York." 
</P>
<P>
The suits were brought during his tenure as president of the Connecticut 
Coastal Fishermen's Assn., a group he co-founded to help fishermen deal with 
regulatory agencies and polluters. 
</P>
<P>
The Soundkeepers Fund was established with proceeds from the settlement of an 
association lawsuit against Norwalk in 1986, when local oyster beds were closed 
due to sewage contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Publicity about contaminated shellfish beds "is a double-edged sword," said 
Stonington fisherman Joe Gilbert. "On the one hand, we need municipal and 
federal agencies to take note." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, such publicity causes sales to drop immediately, 
even though "pollution in one place doesn't mean contaminated shellfish all up 
and down the coast." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Gilbert approves of Backer's work. "Terry's always working to 
improve the lot of fishermen. He goes to a lot of meetings, he speaks up, and 
he speaks for a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
A Legacy 
</P>
<P>
Though he still manages to go oyster fishing, Backer's campaign on behalf of 
the sound is a seven-day-a-week job. "It's the house I don't own, the novel I 
didn't write. It's the legacy I will leave my children." 
</P>
<P>
He is thickset and stocky, with Popeye biceps, unanchored shirttail and a face 
that evokes a Connecticut autumn: sky-blue eyes, wind-chapped skin and a chin 
full of reddish-gold scrub. A tiny gold anchor pierces one earlobe, and a faded 
denim cap stained with fish blood moors his hair. 
</P>
<P>
A self-described "walking contradiction," he's a smoker who worries about air 
quality; a fisherman who frequents a seafood restaurant, then orders hot dogs 
for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
He's also a pollution fighter who objects to being called an environmentalist, 
"a word that conjures up images of kooks in canoes, tree-huggers, liberals." 
</P>
<P>
He prefers "fisherman," and when asked why, cites King James: "My God, it's a 
noble trade! It was the apostles' own calling." 
</P>
<P>
"There is something noble about being a fisherman, about producing food for 
people to eat," Backer said. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was restlessness, not nobility, that led him to choose his father's 
lobster boat over a high-school education. He also worked at a gas station, 
then set off at 16 to see the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I picked crops in California, I logged in Oregon. To give you an idea of the 
politicizing of Terry Backer, I once owned a T-shirt that said, 'Sierra Club: 
Kiss My Ax.' There is some confusion in society about just what natural 
resources are for." 
</P>
<P>
The T-shirt is long gone, as is any confusion on its owner's part. "The Earth 
is for everyone," Backer said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not against progress. But if progress means water you can't drink, plants 
you can't grow, fish you can't eat and air you can't breathe, we need to 
redefine progress." 
</P>
<P>
His effort on behalf of the sound began in earnest after a fishing trip to 
Alaska in the early '70s. "It was very beautiful -- as pristine as you can get. 
Then I came back here to work with my father and one day, while looking over 
the side of the boat, I saw that the place had really gone downhill. There were 
rafts of human sewage floating downriver. 
</P>
<P>
"Each generation leaves less behind. My grandfather didn't know it could all be 
consumed, that it could be possible to dig out all the marshes. How we got here 
is ignorance. How we stay here is arrogance." 
</P>
<P>
Backer's credentials as a fisherman help buttress his argument. "He's not an 
ivory-tower environmentalist," Kennedy said. "He can be much more persuasive 
because he's able to say, 'I've got a family that may go hungry because you are 
discharging this stuff into Long Island Sound and I want you to stop.' Or, 
'Because you are dredging this shoal for your pleasure boat, I'm going to lose 
income this year.' " 
</P>
<P>
"The idea that environmentalists take jobs away from people is still very 
prevalent," Backer said. "We've become supermarketized. Clean water and the 
first 6 inches of soil are what keep us all going. 
</P>
<P>
"People say that you can't compare worms and clams with people. What I'm trying 
to tell them is that when the worms and the clams go, we are not far behind." 
</P>
<P>
He uses a donated 19-foot powerboat to look for things that don't belong: dead 
fish, raw sewage, detergent foam, spewing pipes. The boat is small for a 
reason. "Most of the problems are right around the edges," in shallow water. 
With 86 sewage-treatment plants all emptying into the sound, there's always 
something to find. 
</P>
<P>
On this particular Sunday -- "Sundays are good days to catch people doing 
things they shouldn't be doing" -- he finds a solvent leaving a sheen on the 
surface of the Norwalk River. 
</P>
<P>
Backer frowns at the sight of a hen mallard dipping her bill into a tiny oil 
slick, then follows the trail until the river narrows, forcing him to turn 
back. He'll cover the rest of the distance on foot. 
</P>
<P>
"When I find something in the water, that's when the real work begins." 
Tracking the culprit could take weeks. Much of the work is done in the office, 
the second floor of an aging clapboard house overlooking an inlet. 
</P>
<P>
A hand-lettered sign over the door says "War Room." 
</P>
<P>
"It's considered good form for people involved in causes to say things like, 
'There are no enemies here,' " Backer said. "But there is an enemy. The enemy 
is people, companies, municipalities. Whoever puts that dollar ahead of the 
environment that's going to sustain my kids, you're my enemy." 
</P>
<P>
Far more battles take place in the hearing room than the courtroom. "Every 
problem doesn't need to be addressed with a lawsuit," Backer said. "If I can go 
to a community and talk to people, write letters, or show up and do interviews 
with the local newspapers, a lot of times that's all it takes to get people 
thinking differently. 
</P>
<P>
"Government works best when people participate. Without citizen input, the guys 
in the $800 suits are going to get what they want for the people they work 
for." 
</P>
<P>
Though the battles continue, Backer believes he and the sound already have won 
the war. "What we've won is an awareness around the area that someone is here, 
and someone is watching."

OLD-GROWTH FORESTS TAKE ROOT AS A DIVISIVE ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LANCASTER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>

OAKRIDGE, Ore.

<TEXT>
<P>
Freshly felled trees lay like match sticks on the hill overlooking Windfall 
Lake, a small, clear jewel that brims with cutthroat trout and once was flanked 
by towering stands of Douglas fir. 
</P>
<P>
To Forest Service managers, the 35-acre timber sale was a routine part of 
business in the Willamette National Forest, a sprawling, New Jersey-sized 
preserve that is the largest timber producer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But to Forest Service wildlife biologist Ken Kestner, it was a mistake. Last 
summer, Kestner identified the area as the "center of activity" for a pair of 
northern spotted owls -- a rare, nocturnal species uniquely dependent on the 
Northwest's virgin forests -- and recommended against the cutting. 
</P>
<P>
"I would assume that whatever tree they used for nesting has probably been 
harvested out," Kestner said while touring the site recently. "I see it as 
making a significant impact." 
</P>
<P>
The division within the Forest Service is symptomatic of the broader debate 
over the future of the Northwest's dwindling ancient forests, a mountainous, 
fog-shrouded realm that stretches from Northern California to British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy entered the national political arena after lawsuits by 
environmental groups on behalf of the spotted owl limited timber sales 
throughout the Northwest, prompting loud protests from logging towns and the 
timber industry. 
</P>
<P>
But the compromise that emerged from Congress in September was only a yearlong 
stopgap, leaving unresolved basic questions with profound implications for 
national forest policy, the environment and the economy of the Pacific 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
On one side are the multibillion-dollar wood-products industry and hundreds of 
towns that depend on the timber harvest for their economic lifeblood. On the 
other are environmentalists, many scientists and a mounting body of evidence 
that "old-growth" virgin forests play a key role in the maintenance of wildlife 
populations, soil quality and biological diversity. 
</P>
<P>
Because the forests make up the last remnants of temperate rain forests in the 
continental United States, the debate has also assumed international 
significance in light of U.S. efforts to curb the destruction of rain forests 
in Brazil and elsewhere in the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
Although Northwest forests are replanted or grow back on their own, scientists 
say that generations will pass before they assume the characteristics of those 
they replaced. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides the aesthetic value, old-growth forests represent a reservoir of 
biological diversity and nutrient recycling that is essentially irreplaceable," 
said C. J. Ralph, a Forest Service research ecologist. 
</P>
<P>
Concentrated for the most part in 12 national forests on the western slope of 
the Cascades, these giant evergreen stands of spruce, hemlock and Douglas fir 
-- some more than 500 years old and taller than a 30-story building -- once 
covered an estimated 19 million acres. 
</P>
<P>
Today scientists say only 2.5 million to 3.5 million acres of old-growth timber 
remain and that is disappearing at the rate of 67,000 acres a year. About 
900,000 acres are permanently protected in parks or wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have tried for years to slow the logging in the Northwest, 
but they acquired the mechanism to do so only after the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service agreed to consider listing the spotted owl as an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
Under intense pressure from logging interests, members of the Northwest's 
congressional delegations fashioned a compromise that forced environmentalists 
to lift some of the injunctions in exchange for reducing the overall timber 
harvests for 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to assertions by some politicians that the lawsuits had shut down 
mills throughout Oregon, the injunctions will not have a significant impact 
until next year. 
</P>
<P>
That is because the injunctions blocked timber sales, which typically take 
place a year or two in advance of harvesting, and loggers are still cutting 
trees from timber purchased in 1988 or before. 
</P>
<P>
"The cutting is going on fiercely," said Mike Kerrick, supervisor of the 
Willamette. "The market's been real hot." 
</P>
<P>
Timber industry spokesmen assert that further restrictions will jeopardize jobs 
and communities. Moreover, they say, adequate amounts of old-growth timber 
already are protected in parks and wilderness areas, while modern forestry 
practices ensure a sound environment in harvested forests. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't an all-or-nothing situation," said Chris West, a forester with the 
Northwest Forestry Assn., an industry group. "We may not have as many spotted 
owls, but the biological diversity will be there." 
</P>
<P>
Although the matter is far from settled, few people expect the record harvests 
of recent years to persist. The Forest Service is preparing long-term 
management plans for the Northwest, and officials have indicated that 
old-growth and spotted owls will figure prominently in the calculations. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Associate Chief George Leonard announced that the service had 
adopted a policy that would preserve about half the remaining unprotected old 
growth in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists were skeptical, noting that the Forest Service has yet to 
decide precisely which forests fall into the category. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, even the agency's harshest critics concede that the Forest 
Service's traditional focus on timber production is changing. Publicity 
brochures emphasize recreation and wilderness, not tree farms. More 
significantly, pesticide use is down, and loggers often are required to leave 
branches and other tree remnants for the benefit of soil and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very capable of altering our management systems to protect more of the 
kinds of ecological values associated with old growth," said Jerry Franklin, 
the service's chief plant ecologist and a frequent critic of past logging 
practices. "Right now the rate of change is just breathtaking. And it's very 
hard to see where it's going to end." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps nowhere are competing pressures more acute than in the 1.7-million-acre 
Willamette, which sprawls across Oregon's western Cascades like a giant throw 
rug. 
</P>
<P>
Like other national forests in the Northwest, the Willamette remained largely 
undisturbed until the postwar building boom. Even now, "scenic buffers" along 
major roads shield many logged-over areas from public view. 
</P>
<P>
But from the air can be seen a checkerboard of bald hillsides and mountains 
laced with logging roads. Spotted owls and environmentalists notwithstanding, 
timber still drives the regional economy and accounts for 85% of the 
Willamette's management budget, according to Kerrick. 
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 acres of old-growth remain in the Willamette, and 90,000 of that 
has been permanently protected as designated wilderness. Management plans call 
for setting aside an additional 207,000 acres for at least the next 15 years, 
Kerrick said. 
</P>
<P>
"The environmental community would have you believe that the last of the 
old-growth is on a logging truck, and that's not the case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rangers such as Karen Barnett emphasize recreation -- hiking, rock-climbing, 
fishing, boating. "Sweet Home probably has more opportunities (for recreation) 
than other districts," Barnett said. "We have significant stands of old-growth 
left." 
</P>
<P>
But many government scientists remain concerned that the Forest Service's shift 
in priorities may come too late for some species, particularly the spotted owl. 
Some scientists estimate that a single pair of the rare nocturnal birds, which 
grow to about 15 inches tall, require about 4,000 acres of old-growth forest to 
ensure an adequate food supply. 
</P>
<P>
"If you cut down the old trees, you will drive the bird to extinction," said 
Charles Meslow, an Oregon State University professor of wildlife ecology who 
has studied the bird since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists estimate that the bird's population, now at about 3,000 pairs, is 
declining at the rate of 1% to 2% a year. 
</P>
<P>
But forest managers in the Willamette and elsewhere are still obligated to 
provide timber at the levels specified by Congress. As a consequence, they 
frequently find themselves at odds with their own biologists. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent conflict has occurred in Oakridge, a traditional Oregon timber 
town where local officials have been trying to diversify the economy through 
tourism. The effort got a boost last summer, when the local sawmill shut down 
after running out of timber on adjacent private lands. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, you can't sell yourself as a recreational paradise if you have no 
trees," City Administrator Wes Hare said. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Hare and the supervisor of the local recreation center, Norm 
Coyer, learned of the Forest Service plan to allow logging at Windfall Lake, 
their favorite trout fishing spot. "I've been to hundreds of lakes in this part 
of Oregon and I've never seen one quite like it," Coyer said. "It was a very 
special place." 
</P>
<P>
The two raised the matter with Kestner, the Forest Service biologist, who 
agreed that it should not be logged. Situated in a remote basin reached after a 
grueling scramble down a steep mountainside, the lake in reality is a tiny 
pond, formed when a natural landslide dammed a creek. 
</P>
<P>
With its high elevation and girdle of old-growth forest, the area constituted 
"a mini, little wilderness," Kestner said. Moreover, Kestner determined that 
the area was being used by a pair of spotted owls, although he was never able 
to find the nest. 
</P>
<P>
But the district ranger overruled his request, explaining that no "substitute" 
timber was available elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Kerrick said he is sympathetic to Kestner's concern but that a timber sale, 
once made, is very difficult to undo. "That's hard for biologists to accept," 
Kerrick said.

SUCCESS EGGS HER ON; 
</P>
<P>
STUDENT, 17, LAYS CLAIM TO LOWERING CHOLESTEROL IN HER HENS' PRODUCTS

<TEXT>
<P>
She's been called the "Chicken Feed Queen" by schoolmates and doubted by 
scientists, but Alice Havens remains undeterred in her quest to help millions 
of egg-loving Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Every day about 5 a.m., the 17-year-old high school student slips out of bed 
and into a pair of boots kept by the kitchen door, then heads for her back 
yard, where she feeds 25 hens a special formula to cut the cholesterol in eggs. 
</P>
<P>
Cholesterol-lowering research also is going on in laboratories where 
researchers with advanced degrees and heavy funding measure results with fancy 
instruments. Havens' experiment started out as a project for a science fair. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting at the kitchen table, she opens a notebook to the typed pages that 
detail her research. She says the charts show that the special feed has dropped 
the cholesterol count 22% to 27%, and that it is going down even further. 
</P>
<P>
Some scientists are skeptical, questioning her testing methods and results. 
Edward Naber, who has been doing egg experiments for 30 years at Ohio State 
University, doesn't think her numbers are significant. 
</P>
<P>
Havens, who has applied for a patent, is pushing on. Her words get stronger, 
her pace quicker, when asked to respond to skeptics: "Well, that's your opinion 
and I've got mine, and just because of what you said isn't going to make me 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
The Havens family lives in a big, frame house tucked deep in the woods in 
Sherman, with two horses, a collie, two cats and Alice's 25 chickens. 
</P>
<P>
Science has occupied her since seventh grade, when the papier-mache volcanoes 
she made with her best friend, Hannah Roberts, won a prize at the Science 
Horizons fair in Danbury. "We built all these volcanoes, and we had a backdrop 
and everything, with moss and paint, and it was a huge mess." Inspired by her 
teacher, John Halloran, she kept entering the fair, studying vision in horses 
one year, chicken feed in another. In early tests, she gave her hens different 
diets, like sunflower seeds and oyster shells; she started testing for 
cholesterol when she entered New Milford High School. 
</P>
<P>
"What I did was I tested different things on the hens, things farmers sometimes 
fed, to see if the cholesterol level would change in any way." 
</P>
<P>
She hit pay dirt with the third diet, an ingredient she decided to try -- and 
won't disclose -- because a friend of her sister had a lot of it. Before, the 
hens laid jumbo eggs with 388 milligrams of cholesterol; after, it was 340. 
</P>
<P>
Havens says the level has dropped even more, but she won't release the figures 
until the next phase of the experiment is over. She also is trying to pinpoint 
exactly what in the feed is working. 
</P>
<P>
Many researchers have tried to cut eggs' cholesterol but failed to find a safe, 
cheap diet, said Naber, a food science professor. He questioned Havens' 
figures, and said a large Connecticut egg has 202 milligrams of cholesterol and 
the national average is 213. 
</P>
<P>
Havens sticks by her guns, saying she started out with bigger eggs and has not 
relied on U.S. Department of Agriculture standards as a benchmark. She also has 
been egged on, so to speak, by the accolades she has won. 
</P>
<P>
At the kitchen table, she flips through a scrapbook to certificates and letters 
from the American Heart Assn. and the Nutmeg Institute of Food Technologists, 
and mementos such as a luggage tag from her trip to Knoxville, Tenn., for the 
International Science Fair. Her booty includes an encyclopedia set, five shares 
of stock in United Technologies Corp., a leather briefcase, five trophies on 
her bedroom dresser, four framed certificates on the wall above her bed, and 
enough cash to pay for the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Havens went to London for a science symposium with 800 students 
from around the world. She presented her research, made friends, toured castles 
-- and initiated a walkout at one session when a boy from Ireland made 
disparaging remarks about Vice President Dan Quayle. She was reprimanded for 
taking 400 students with her when she left in disgust.

Military jets scream over this lonely island near Martha's Vineyard and pepper 
the ground it with dummy bombs -- but environmentalists don't mind, because 
wildlife is thriving amid the noise. The important factor is that there are no 
people here. 
</P>
<P>
The island, Navy property since 1952, is a crucial resting spot for birds 
migrating from Canada and the Northeast to Central and South America. To 
protect the rare species found here, the U.S. Department of Interior in 1975 
designated the northeastern third of the island a wildlife sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the 640 acres is used as a target range by pilots in the Navy and 
Marine Corps reserves and the Air National Guards of Massachusetts, New York 
and Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only air target range in this region," said Ens. Edward Matlock of 
the Weymouth Naval Air Station, which runs the island. The closest alternatives 
are in Maryland or Canada, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pilots in training try to drop unarmed practice bombs into a 200-foot ring of 
tires. The center of the target is a bull's eye formed of tractor tires. 
</P>
<P>
Recently the site was cleared because knee-high grass was obscuring the target 
area, said Capt. John G. Kuchinski Jr., commander at the Weymouth Station. 
</P>
<P>
"They end up dropping (bombs) elsewhere in the island," Kuchinski said. 
</P>
<P>
An inspection team of environmentalists, military personnel and engineers 
recently did find one of the dummy bombs inside the wildlife sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
Kuchinski has warned pilots that they could be stripped of their wings if they 
are caught violating the sanctuary boundaries. And residents of Martha's 
Vineyard, a couple of miles across the ocean, keep watch on Noman's and 
occasionally report seeing a B-52 or an F-111B stray over the sanctuary, 
Kuchinski said. 
</P>
<P>
"Flight crews are like everybody else," Kuchinski said. "Occasionally, you get 
somebody who thinks he has a license" to do anything. 
</P>
<P>
Conservation officials say they welcome the Navy's stewardship of the island, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
If the public were not wary of unexploded ordnance left on the island -- live 
bombs were used in the past -- and the penalties for trespassing on government 
property, visitors would swarm over the island, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"In a very short time, the island would be trashed," said Augustus Ben David 
II, director of the Felix Neck Wildlife Sanctuary on the Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were turned over to the Fish and Wildlife Service, enforcement against 
trespassers would go down rather than up," said Tom French, who heads the state 
Natural Heritage and Endangered Species program. 
</P>
<P>
When Ben David and French visited the island with the military clean-up crew, 
they saw birds of 41 species and eight kinds of butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Ben David said he spotted turtles of three species, Canada geese, herring gulls 
and "a wonderful muskrat population." The vegetation is so lush that crossing a 
cranberry bog is like walking on a mattress, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Wildlife is all over, even in the target zones," said Ben David. "It's 
absolutely an incredible place -- from a naturalist's standpoint, an incredible 
place." 
</P>
<P>
French said he saw Canadian forest birds and birds of prey, including a few 
peregrine falcons nesting on the 80-foot bluffs along the shore. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that it sounds terrible to have people bombing the island," 
French said, "but what you expect to see and what reality is are worlds apart."

MISSION'S COMPUTERS PROVIDE DENVER'S HOMELESS A LINK TO LITERACY, JOBS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: ONE RELIEF AGENCY WANTS TO DO MORE THAN FEED, CLOTHE AND SAVE THE 
SOULS OF ITS PATRONS. IT TEACHES THEM TO READ, WRITE AND USE COMPUTERS TOO.

<P>
The Denver Rescue Mission, the oldest relief agency in the city, isn't 
interested in just feeding, clothing and saving the souls of the down and out. 
It wants them to read, write and understand computers too. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the red-brick building with the blue "Jesus Saves" sign over the door, 
director Del Maxfield is trying to redefine the goals of a shelter for the 
homeless as well as the needs of the men who seek help there. 
</P>
<P>
The latest innovation is a computer-based program for functionally illiterate 
adults. It is part of "a new sophistication of the old urban missions" in 
response to changes in the makeup of the growing homeless population in 
America, Maxfield said. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, he said, shelters were thought to be doing their job by providing 
a roof, a prayer and a meal for hobos and alcoholics. 
</P>
<P>
The new homeless are "people who are economically distressed, abused, people 
from broken families" who need more, he said. "It's a very complex world of 
homelessness out there." 
</P>
<P>
In appearance, the Denver Rescue Mission, founded in 1893, reveals little of 
its new-wave approach. It sits on a run-down corner a few blocks east of 
Denver's skyscrapers. Weeds poke out of the sidewalk and curbs. At mealtimes, 
lines of ragged men wait at the front door, as always. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, though, a clinic provides free medical, dental and eye care. It gave 
away more than 1,000 pairs of glasses last year. And not only does it teach 
literacy, but computer literacy as well. 
</P>
<P>
Its computer room, in the basement, contains three terminals and file cabinets 
and bookshelves crammed with computer-course materials. The materials include 
science, math, Bible studies and geography as well as basic reading, writing 
and spelling. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent day at the mission, two men sat in the computer room, one studying 
computers and the other Spanish, specialized skills for, they hope, specialized 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men, Mike, 27, had come to the shelter a month earlier from Dallas 
after losing his job as a truck driver because of "personal problems." He has a 
high school equivalency diploma and is studying computer programming in hopes 
of applying for college soon. Some others who study at the shelter have only an 
elementary-school education. 
</P>
<P>
Mike said he came to Denver to find "a new beginning, a fresh start," and 
showed up at the mission for a meal. He now spends about five hours a week with 
the computers and works in various jobs at the mission about 42 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
He wants to become a counselor or perhaps a pastor, he said. "It's been a dream 
for a few years," he said. "I guess I didn't have enough confidence to make an 
effort at it." 
</P>
<P>
The mission provides 140 beds for homeless people for up to 10 nights and feeds 
about 450 people a day, but Mike is one of 28 "program men." These are men who 
live at the mission and are enrolled in its rehabilitation program. They must 
spend at least two hours a week at the computers and show a commitment to 
staying free of drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
One shelter resident, who had some knowledge of computers before he came to the 
shelter, landed a job with a pharmaceutical company after less than a month in 
the program, said Aaron Mossman, coordinator of the new literacy program. 
</P>
<P>
Working at computers can be a positive experience for people who lead 
"negative" lives, Mossman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's simple, but it's positive. They sit, push a button and something happens. 
They've just succeeded three times. They begin to build positive mental 
attitudes that 'I can,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
The word "homeless" doesn't begin to describe the people who need help from the 
mission, Maxfield said. There are those who are literally without homes, he 
said, and then there are those he calls "the poor and needy," who may have a 
home but no food, or are in imminent danger of becoming homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that we have lacked is knowing what these people want to do 
in life," Maxfield said. "We're trying to find a way to test these people, see 
how they're wired, so we can send them down a road of success instead of more 
failure." 
</P>
<P>
Maxfield, who worked for 24 years in the aerospace industry before leaving to 
get a master's degree in divinity, came to the Denver Rescue Mission from the 
Fuller Seminary in California. He has, he said, an ingrown awareness of the 
value of education. "I'm a high school dropout myself. I had to learn that a 
formal education was important. I've had some tough times of my own. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got here, I noticed that people would fake reading the Bible and the 
hymnals. I discovered that a lot of these people couldn't read." 
</P>
<P>
So he, along with the chairman of the shelter's board, Roy O. Howell, a retired 
schoolteacher, and other volunteer educators began a tutoring program to help 
the shelter's wards earn high school equivalency diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
Then, a year ago, Maxfield visited Accelerated Christian Education Inc. in 
Dallas to take a look at its computer-oriented education courses for schools. 
He worked with ACE to develop similar programs for adults, from the illiterate 
to those in need of refresher courses. The resulting program began at the 
mission a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The literacy program and other courses are financed entirely by donations, 
Maxfield said. In 1988, the Denver Rescue Mission reported revenues of 
$717,000, all of it from donations and interest. The shelter probably has 
invested at least $6,000 so far in the literacy program, Maxfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Maxfield believes in taking the mission to the streets as well. He said many 
cannot leave their camps in railroad yards or under viaducts because they are 
afraid of being robbed. This doesn't faze Maxfield. He said he developed street 
smarts during a previous job as a chaplain in the Los Angeles County jail 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The mission also has a truck that collects unused food from Denver-area 
supermarkets and drops it off in poor neighborhoods. And it has a farm in 
northern Colorado where interested shelter residents can get away from city 
pressures and help grow food for the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Now Maxfield is expanding the mission to include a shelter and 
vocational-training center for women in a building being renovated nearby. It 
is scheduled to open in January. 
</P>
<P>
Maxfield hopes that the computers ultimately will be used not only for 
educational and vocational training, but for personal development. 
</P>
<P>
Such as? 
</P>
<P>
"How to balance a checkbook," he said.

Immigration officials deported 18 Chinese students to Japan on Friday after 
they were found to be traveling with fake passports. 
</P>
<P>
The students were sent to Tokyo about 17 hours after arriving at Seoul's Kimpo 
International Airport last week with fake Argentine passports, airport 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The students staged a hunger strike overnight at the airport after South Korean 
immigration officials asked them to leave or go back to Tokyo where they had 
been studying, airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The students said they were going to Canada to seek refuge because they feared 
punishment for having staged anti-government protests in Japan against the 
brutal suppression of the pro-democracy movement in Beijing's Tian An Men 
Square in June.

Marion Gail Weiss held up her slender hands, palms facing inward, in front of 
her to make the point. "I had this image," the architect says, "of women's 
hands, all those women's hands and the unrecognized work those women did." 
</P>
<P>
Soon that image will be transformed into a centerpiece -- of 10 triangular 
prisms of glass -- in a monument to the women of the United States who have 
served in the military. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss, a 31-year-old assistant professor of architecture at the University of 
Maryland for the last year, and Michael Manfredi, 36, an architect in New York 
City, were announced recently as the winners of the competition to design the 
memorial, which was authorized by Congress in 1986. It will cost $25 million -- 
to be raised by private funds -- and is scheduled to be completed by 1992. The 
site, which is at the Memorial Gate Area at Arlington National Cemetery -- 
where millions of Americans pay their respects to the country's war dead -- is 
directly across from the Lincoln Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge was the sensitivity of the site and the sensitivity of the 
subject -- the role of women in the military. For too long, they have been 
unseen," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
"This sheds light on their unrecognized achievements," added Manfredi, her 
design partner. "We didn't want this to be garish or upstage any of the other 
sites. We wanted this to be part of the family of monuments." 
</P>
<P>
Wilma L. Vaught, the retired Air Force brigadier general who is president of 
the nonprofit Women in Military Service for America Memorial Foundation that 
oversaw the selection process, praised the design, which will feature 39-foot 
prisms and incorporate the main features -- the wrought iron gates, the curved 
wall known as the "Hemicycle" and wide plaza -- already on the site. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful monument and representation of women's contribution to the 
military," she said. "It is also very uplifting." The announcement of the 
winning design had been made to coincide with Veteran's Day, she said, and to 
celebrate the commemoration of National Women's Veterans Recognition Week. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss explained the symbolism of the design, selected from among 137 entries in 
the competition. In addition to the 10 prisms -- "hands by day, illuminated 
candles by night" -- there will be four staircases leading from the ground 
level to a terrace. "They symbolize the slow passage for women, their struggle 
and ascent in the military," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
In her chosen field of architecture, Weiss said she wished there were fewer 
barriers for women as well. "I wish I could say it was easier," she admitted, 
"but it is difficult for women to get ahead. But I'm optimistic that there are 
more and more role models for women." 
</P>
<P>
This professional pairing began in 1984 when Weiss -- a 1983 graduate of the 
Yale School of Architecture -- joined the New York architectural firm of 
Mitchell Giurgola. There she met Manfredi, who had graduated from Cornell with 
a master's degree in architecture in 1979. The two joined forces for such 
clients as IBM and Volvo. They also became friends, the kind of friends who are 
apt to finish each other's sentences. They even look somewhat alike: they are 
slight, dark-haired and partial to black clothing. 
</P>
<P>
When they chose to branch out on their own two years ago, they decided to open 
offices in New York and Washington, where Manfredi, a graduate of Winston 
Churchill High School in Potomac, had family. 
</P>
<P>
So far, their combined work has been included in an exhibit organized by the 
Architectural League of New York called "Vacant Lots" for their design for 
low-income housing in Manhattan. Weiss, who divides her time between Washington 
and New York City, is also at work on an apartment project on upper Fifth 
Avenue in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Yet nothing prepared them for this professional breakthrough. "We're really 
still starting out," she said. "This is an amazing feeling for us. We're very 
thrilled to have won. It is an amazing opportunity for us." 
</P>
<P>
Although they were paid $10,000 as one of four finalists in June to go into the 
second phase -- completion of a scaled-down model -- and will be paid $10,000 
for their continued work on the project, not large sums by architectural 
project standards, they agreed it was not a labor for money. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss, who grew up near San Francisco, recalled that her father had served in 
the Navy in the late 1940s. And Manfredi's mother, Dorothy, served as a U.S. 
Army nurse for 11 years, beginning in the Pacific during World War II. It was 
Dorothy Manfredi who first showed her son the clipping about the competition 
and urged the duo to enter. 
</P>
<P>
When the monument opens, women will be able to place their hands at the base of 
the prisms where women's memories of their military experiences will be 
inscribed. They will be able to stand inside the monument and walk the curved 
time line, which will explain women's role in the military since the 
Revolutionary War. They will also be able to enter the heart of the monument 
and use computers to read the register of names of women who have served their 
country. (For $25, any woman who has served in the military can register to be 
included in the computer files; it is part of the ongoing effort to raise money 
to complete the memorial.) 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really excited about the idea of people coming to this memorial," Weiss 
said. "Women who've served in the military will bring their grandchildren and 
tell their stories and later their children will come telling the stories. The 
thing that's unique is that it doesn't commemorate dead people, but it 
commemorates all those who served. It's also a living memorial and will be 
there to tell a story and to inspire all those women who will serve in the 
future."

ISRAEL'S COLLECTIVE FARMS AGREE TO GOVERNMENT BAILOUT 
</P>

<P>
Israel's financially strapped collective farm movement agreed to an austerity 
program including meatless meals and fewer trips abroad under a government 
bailout of its $3.6-billion debt, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The collective farms, a symbol of Israel's socialist pioneers, also agreed to 
increase investment in light industry, said Shimon Helman, spokesman for the 
United Kibbutz Movement. 
</P>
<P>
"It's part of a trend," he said. "We already produce far more than the 
agricultural needs of the state, so we are looking for profitable exports, like 
winter fruit and flowers to Western Europe and light industry." 
</P>
<P>
Kibbutzim were founded at the turn of the century by European immigrants who 
believed that hard work on collective farms would build a unique Israeli 
character. But the movement's debts and aging population have forced kibbutzim 
to invest in light industry, which accounts for half of their profits. 
</P>
<P>
The movement also agreed to sell $20 million in assets, including property in 
Tel Aviv, and ordered member farms to serve two meatless meals a week as part 
of a 7% cutback in living expenses, Helman said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the government will write off $835 million in debts. 
</P>
<P>
It will offer tax breaks to banks to give the collective farms 25-year loans at 
4.5% interest to cover the remainder of the total debt. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was approved by the United Kibbutz Movement early this month. The 
smaller Kibbutz Artzi movement had already accepted the program. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a tremendous amount of disagreement over whether to accept the 
government offer," Helman said. "It does not address our future, the building 
of new kibbutzes, the absorption of new immigrants or our pension plan." 
</P>
<P>
Helman said many kibbutz members blamed the government for creating the 
unfavorable exchange rates and high interest rates that devastated kibbutz 
exports and helped cause the huge debt. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports said Finance Minister Shimon Peres, head of the center-left 
Labor Party, pressured the movement to accept the offer. 
</P>
<P>
The movement's 164 collective farms are affiliated with Labor, while the 
Kibbutz Artzi movement's 84 collective farms are linked to the socialist Mapam 
party. The two groups have 110,000 members.

HOT LINE TRIES TO ANSWER DRUG ADDICTS' CALLS FOR HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The calls come in every few minutes, cries for help from a torrent of desperate 
people overwhelmed by drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
A homeless crack addict needs shelter and therapy. A man addicted to heroin for 
seven years asks about rehabilitation programs. A cab driver with a nine-year 
cocaine habit wants admission to an outpatient treatment facility. 
</P>
<P>
Shattered by drugs, they have called a toll-free substance abuse hot line 
headquartered in a ramshackle building in Manhattan's Washington Heights 
neighborhood, an inner-city area that has been called "the crack capital of 
America." 
</P>
<P>
The confidential hot line, operated by the Community League of West 159th 
Street, is a window onto the nation's war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Spend a few hours listening to counselors talking on the hot line and you will 
hear of addicts who have lost their families, their homes and their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
You will learn of a social service system so overburdened that it simply cannot 
cope. 
</P>
<P>
And you will discover that even after the latest offensive in the war on drugs, 
impoverished addicts who yearn for treatment are told that they will have to 
wait up to a year to enter an inpatient rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
The stories told by a succession of callers send a disturbing message: Drug 
addiction is entrenched in America's social fabric -- and the government has 
barely put a dent in the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"America has become -- it isn't becoming -- a drug-infested society," said 
Lucille Bulger, the league's 77-year-old founder. "I think it's past epidemic 
proportions. It's a national infestation." 
</P>
<P>
"The problem has gotten worse, and we're not equipped to deal with it," said 
hot-line coordinator Yvonne Stennet, 34. "There are so many people out there 
who need our help and we just don't have the services to meet the problem." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the hot line, the league runs a number of programs in the 
Washington Heights area, including after-school events and a nutrition center 
for children and a housing management service to renovate city-owned buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Funded by government grants, the league focuses on grass-roots activism to 
reinvigorate the neighborhood, which is populated largely by blacks and Latinos 
and recently has experienced an influx of immigrants from the Dominican 
Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Its hot line receives calls from throughout New York state and the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
The callers are not confined to the stereotypical inner-city junkie. Indeed, 
experts say there has been an upsurge in middle-class use of drugs like crack, 
and calls to the hot line reflect that rise. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 400 to 600 monthly calls to the hot line are from people seeking 
help for heroin, crack and cocaine addiction. According to a spokesman at the 
state division of Substance Abuse Services, in 1988, there were nearly 500,000 
daily, heavy users of these "hard" drugs in New York City alone and that figure 
is expected to jump for 1989 as the crack epidemic worsens. 
</P>
<P>
Most callers to the hot line, which is staffed 16 hours a day, want to know 
where they can find help. The counselors have a long list of organizations -- 
ranging from support groups to homeless shelters to rehabilitation programs -- 
to which they make referrals. 
</P>
<P>
The callers' voices are usually tinged with fear and anxiety, for by the time 
they decide to dial 1-800-LET-IT-GO, they have reached bottom. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had people on the phone who have a knife in their hand and they're ready 
to kill themselves," Stennet said, adding that it is not uncommon for addicts 
to call when they are high on drugs or paranoid from the crash after a crack 
binge. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent weekday afternoon, counselor Red Cotto was talking in a soft, 
friendly voice to Wayne, a 25-year-old crack addict who said he wanted to enter 
a treatment facility. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you on the crack, Wayne?" Cotto asked. "Are you high right now?" 
</P>
<P>
Sounding distracted and stuttering as he talked, Wayne admitted he was high. He 
was also homeless and without any money or medical insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Cotto, 42, referred him to a city-run men's shelter and gave him the address 
and phone number of a treatment facility that takes homeless addicts on a 
priority basis. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Wayne was lucky that he was homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Addicts with shelter who cannot afford the high fees of private rehabilitation 
centers can wait up to a year for inpatient treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The delay is demoralizing for counselors who must tell addicts either to wait 
or to seek an outpatient program, which is usually less effective in treating 
drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a hell of a problem," Stennet said. "It's frustrating -- you get someone 
on the phone, you know you can help them, but there's nothing available." 
</P>
<P>
"If I've heard one outrageous call, I've heard hundreds," Cotto said. But he is 
quick to point out that for every 20 people he counsels on the phone, 10 to 15 
will call back a few days later and thank him, saying they have received help. 
</P>
<P>
"At times, you can look at this as being a thankless job," Cotto said. "But 
when you do get calls of that type, you think, 'Well, I've made a little dent, 
I've made a difference.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ask Bulger about the war on drugs and she will say that politicians have no 
idea how bad the problem really is. 
</P>
<P>
Bulger, who founded the league 37 years ago, has lived in Washington Heights 
all her life. She has seen her neighborhood destroyed by drugs and has heard 
legions of government officials announce they will win the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
She has spent the last few decades urging the government to allocate more money 
for treatment and education, stressing repeatedly that to defeat drugs in the 
inner cities, poverty and ignorance must be attacked. 
</P>
<P>
She is not optimistic.

SOVIETS IMPROVING SEA POWER IN ARCTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>

OSLO, Norway 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The growling fringes of the Arctic icecap and the dark, silent waters beneath 
the North Pole have become test sites in Moscow's drive to match the stealth of 
American submarines. 
</P>
<P>
The Northern Fleet, the Soviet Union's mightiest naval force, increasingly 
exercises in icy seas near Arctic bases on the Kola Peninsula, NATO officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
"They have made big advances in submarine technology and they have an 
impressive under-ice capability," said Gen. Patrick Palmer, commander in chief, 
Allied Forces Northern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The shift away from exercising in more southerly seas, ever more evident since 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985, might be linked to cuts 
in military spending or to a Kremlin desire to be seen projecting less power 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
But the change may also be to teach submarine commanders at the heart of Soviet 
naval power how best to hide in the Arctic Ocean, whose trenches are as deep as 
18,500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
New, longer-range missiles mean that Soviet submarines could fire over the pole 
and not need to venture past NATO-member Norway, risking sonar detection, mines 
and torpedoes from attack submarines to get close enough to strike the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer said that Moscow has continued updating submarines, ships, aircraft and 
other equipment at the Kola bases despite political reforms sweeping through 
Warsaw Pact nations. 
</P>
<P>
The massive Typhoon and Delta IV class ballistic missile submarines have far 
quieter engines than older Soviet models, which Western sonar can hear clanking 
through the oceans hundreds of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The new submarines have SS-N-20 or SS-N-23 nuclear missiles, which the Pentagon 
says have a range of 5,200 miles and could strike any point in the United 
States or Western Europe from Soviet home waters in the Barents Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Typhoon, the world's largest submarine, weighing about 75,000 
tons and stretching 561 feet long, has a titanium hull and strong fins to smash 
through thick polar ice to fire its missiles from the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet submarines are still slightly noisier than their U.S. rivals -- 
spearheaded by the Ohio class ballistic missile submarine -- but grinding, 
creaking Arctic ice provides a natural ally. 
</P>
<P>
"Close to the ice edge, the sound conditions mean it is almost impossible to 
extract any submarine noises," said Adm. Torolf Rein, head of Norway's 
50,000-strong armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the Soviet Union test fires ballistic missiles from the Arctic 
over Siberia to the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
In northern Norway, "the civilian population in Finnmark from time to time, 
particularly in the dark season, see a fireball in the sky because they are 
firing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rein said Moscow has about 40 strategic submarines at Kola alone -- more than 
the whole U.S. fleet. But NATO overall has more and better submarines than the 
Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a Soviet Mike class experimental submarine sank off Norway, 
killing 42 sailors. There have been several other accidents, with two 
Echo-class submarines entangled in Norwegian trawler nets in the last three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"The submarine is the Soviet Navy's principal platform for the conduct of both 
offensive and defensive naval warfare," the Pentagon said in its 1989 review of 
Soviet military power. 
</P>
<P>
But it added that "despite measurable improvements in the Soviet submarine 
force . . . the United States maintains an overall lead" in quietness, combat 
systems and detection systems used in anti-submarine warfare. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has often offered talks on reducing the superpowers' navies but, 
because the Atlantic separates it from its European allies, Washington needs 
superior sea power. 
</P>
<P>
Both U.S. and Soviet submarines have long been able to lurk under the polar ice 
and break through. Washington showed its capability in 1986, when three U.S. 
nuclear-powered submarines surfaced at the North Pole. 
</P>
<P>
Noise is the key to finding nuclear-powered submarines, which can stay 
submerged for weeks and cannot be seen by spy planes or satellites. 
</P>
<P>
Submarines are packed with insulation and the crew wear rubber or felt shoes to 
deaden noise. 
</P>
<P>
Sonar is the only reliable way of detecting submarines at distances of more 
than a mile, according to George Lindsey of the London-based International 
Institute for Strategic Studies in a recent study.

NEW DAY DAWNS AT WALL FOR CHECKPOINT CHARLIE MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPPE NAUGHTON, REUTERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WEST BERLIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 28 years of campaigning, West Berlin's Checkpoint Charlie Museum can 
finally get down to business. The business, that is, of being a museum. 
</P>
<P>
Standing just 50 yards from Europe's most famous East-West crossing point, the 
Checkpoint Charlie Museum has long been a focal point for the campaign to open 
up the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Its run-down premises have been the site of scores of news conferences 
introducing escapees from the East to the Western press and trying to push home 
the message of the misery caused by the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Then on Nov. 9, its battle was suddenly won. The East German government made a 
shock decision to open its frontiers, giving East Germany's 16 million people 
their first chance in 28 years to travel freely to the West. 
</P>
<P>
"I only slept an hour that night. As a German, it was a wonderful experience," 
said Rainer Hildebrandt, who founded the museum in December, 1961, four months 
after the wall was built. 
</P>
<P>
With the wall now open at 15 points around the city, Hildebrandt's campaign for 
free travel between East and West Berlin is almost over. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have to struggle for the 500 political prisoners who have not got out 
of East Germany; this is the only problem. But I'm sure there will be enough 
noise to get them out," Hildebrandt said. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany denies that it has any political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Hildebrandt says, the Checkpoint Charlie Museum can simply be a 
memorial to the thousands of successful escapes from Eastern Europe during the 
last three decades. 
</P>
<P>
"We are lucky enough to have a monopoly. The official museums have always 
avoided the wall. They were always afraid of being considered right-wing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although East Germans flooding across Checkpoint Charlie so far seem reluctant 
to stop off at the museum, more than 1,000 people, mostly foreigners, shuffle 
past the exhibits every day. 
</P>
<P>
It is a powerful monument to human ingenuity, with its collection of escape 
tools reflecting the words on a sign above one exhibit: "Escape Is the Mother 
of Invention." 
</P>
<P>
Among them is the old English Alvis motorcycle in which Friedl Linke of Dresden 
made it to the West in 1969. Linke was hidden in the fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
There are also the two hollowed-out surfboards in which 25-year-old Helke 
Dittrich escaped from East Germany 18 years later. She married the West German 
who smuggled her out. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 80 people died trying to cross the Berlin Wall, the last of them 
only this year. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a young man who tried to get across in February. He was hit by 39 
bullets," Hildebrandt said, still shaking in anger. "Can you imagine how his 
parents feel now?" 
</P>
<P>
The museum is also a memorial to escapes that went wrong, and for that reason 
most of the exhibits are from escapes that occurred away from the city. 
</P>
<P>
Hildebrandt and his friends in the August 13 Community Action Group -- named 
after the date in 1961 when the East Germans first built the Wall -- always 
made a point of discouraging people from trying to cross it. 
</P>
<P>
"We said it clearly: It's too dangerous. Statistically, it was eight times 
safer passing through a third country like Hungary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In numerical terms, the most successful escapes from East Berlin were through 
tunnels under no-man's land in the early days. In 1962, 57 people tunneled to 
the West in 48 hours before East German authorities discovered their escape 
route. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the thousands of escapes, however, Hildebrandt likes to tell the story 
of one -- "the easiest and most original." 
</P>
<P>
It happened one day in 1967 when a young East German marched boldly into 
Checkpoint Charlie, passing by several sets of controls before being stopped by 
a guard. 
</P>
<P>
He told the guard he was an Austrian going to see his dying mother in the west 
of the city, adding that he had already turned his passport in for checks. The 
guard called two colleagues to look after him and went off to look for the 
missing passport. 
</P>
<P>
"What's your problem then?" one of the arriving guards asked. 
</P>
<P>
The young man promptly changed his story. 
</P>
<P>
"I am an Austrian and I've just heard my mother is dying in East Berlin. The 
problem is I've not got my passport on me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll never let you in!" the guard declared. "I'd just head back west if I 
were you and fetch it."

'ICE CURTAIN' BETWEEN ALASKA, SOVIET UNION MELTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

KHABAROVSK, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stern-faced Soviet border guard, his green cap bearing the sword and shield 
of the KGB secret police, hammers his stamp on the exit visas of travelers 
boarding the twice-weekly jet to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
One passenger pushes an American passport and a tiny blue-and-gold pin shaped 
like Alaska across the officer's desk. 
</P>
<P>
"Try it on. It's a souvenir from the other side of the pond," says the grinning 
journalist from Alaska, one of 10 reporters and broadcasters touring the 
once-closed, forbidding Soviet Far East. "We're neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed they are. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly a flight arrives in this city of 600,000, close to the Chinese border, 
without a delegation of Alaskans intent on business ventures or scientific, 
cultural and educational exchanges. Khabarovsk is the military, administrative 
and aviation center of the Soviet Far East, and the only city in the region 
that is officially open to foreign visitors. 
</P>
<P>
This year hundreds of Alaskans and Soviets have crossed the Bering Strait 
between Provideniya on the Chukchi Peninsula and Nome, Alaska, traveling in 
skin boats, ships, propeller-driven planes and jetliners. Officials on both 
sides say the "ice curtain" that once separated the two superpowers has all but 
melted. 
</P>
<P>
"From Cub Scouts to opera singers," says Gina Brelsford, an Alaska official who 
oversees exchanges, "they are all visiting the Soviet Far East." 
</P>
<P>
Visits through Alaska's back door to the Soviet Union were eased in September, 
when U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze signed an agreement allowing visa-free travel across the 
Bering Strait for Eskimos of both countries. The accord also established a 
six-member border commission to monitor trips by the more than 2,000 Eskimos of 
the rival superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet authorities had closed the border in 1948. It didn't officially reopen 
until last year. 
</P>
<P>
Already, a Nome-based airline, Bering Air, is flying round-trip charter flights 
between the United States and Provideniya, carrying both dollar-paying 
Americans and ruble-paying Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper, who helped thaw the curtain with the first 
"friendship flight" of Eskimos and state officials to the Soviet Far East last 
year, is a man with a mission. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the people who are geographically and historically positioned to go into 
the Soviet Union and do what we can to bring our two countries together," 
Cowper said. "I want the Russians to see us as something more than a military 
target. 
</P>
<P>
"Alaska was owned by czarist Russia and we have a lot of Alaskans who have a 
Russian heritage." One of Cowper's ancestors was President Martin van Buren's 
ambassador to czarist Russia in 1840. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be discounted, says Cowper, is Alaskans' "natural curiosity. We're 
adventuresome and we'd like to help over there if we can. The possibilities are 
enormous." 
</P>
<P>
For example: 
</P>
<P>
* Alaska Airlines, a profitable, Seattle-based regional carrier with routes 
from Mexico to the Arctic, has applied for an international route to Magadan, 
Soviet Union and Khabarovsk. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska fishermen are negotiating several dozen deals, some involving the 
exchange of American fish-processing technology for rights to fish Soviet 
waters for king crab and salmon. 
</P>
<P>
* An Anchorage, Alaska, businessman, Mead Treadwell, is negotiating a deal to 
assemble 6,000 personal computers a year in Magadan, which is officially a 
closed, high-security city. The parts would be made in the United States, South 
Korea, Japan and Taiwan. With his ruble profits, Treadwell plans to buy Soviet 
amethyst, reindeer horn, and beer. 
</P>
<P>
* Alaskan and Soviet scientists have exchanged visits to study, among other 
things, polar bears, mining technology and medicine. At least one Russian 
doctor has assisted in operations at an Alaska hospital. 
</P>
<P>
* Alaska and Soviet outdoorsmen and women teamed up earlier this year to travel 
by skis, dog sled and umiak -- skin boat -- more than 1,200 miles from Anadyr 
in the Soviet Far East to Nome. 
</P>
<P>
* Hundreds of Alaska and Soviet schoolchildren have exchanged visits, linking 
Anchorage and Nome with Provideniya and Magadan. 
</P>
<P>
* Eskimo village elders from both sides of the Bering Strait have met on U.S. 
territory to discuss cultural and family problems. 
</P>
<P>
Executives in Anchorage and Washington, D.C., envision possibilities as varied 
as oil and gas exploration on the Soviet side of the Chukchi Sea and a new 
maritime cargo route from the American West Coast to Europe, through the Arctic 
Ocean, using Soviet icebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pace and variety of Alaska-Soviet ties and his enthusiasm for them, 
Cowper, and the U.S. State Department, inject a note of caution to American 
businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's anxious to do business," says Cowper, "but let's get a couple of 
small things together that work, and go from there."

UC REVISES ADMISSIONS POLICIES AMID PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Yat-Pang Au enrolled at UC Berkeley this semester after a two-year battle 
against a school admissions policy that he said discriminated against 
Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
His case has drawn new attention to affirmative action programs designed to 
help minorities enter top colleges and universities -- because in some cases 
they have hampered rather than helped this minority, which scholastically 
outperforms the general population. 
</P>
<P>
Au graduated at the top of his high school class and received awards for 10 
extracurricular activities. But his initial application to Berkeley was 
rejected two years ago because, his father said, of an affirmative action 
policy that put a 40% limit on admissions based strictly on grades and test 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
In a single year, the number of Asian-Americans accepted as freshmen at 
Berkeley dropped from 24% to 21%, amid cries of racism. 
</P>
<P>
"I fight this not because it's my son but for Asian people as a whole," said 
Au's father, Sik Kee Au, a businessman in San Jose, Calif. "One of the most 
important things in life for us is an education." 
</P>
<P>
The university has since revised its admissions policy, and the younger Au 
enrolled there this semester as a junior. His younger brother Yat Hon was 
admitted as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
University officials say the new admissions policy maintains high academic 
standards while reflecting the state's diverse population, helping blacks, 
Latinos and other low-achieving groups. It has placated the once-angry 
Asian-American community, but Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita) wants more. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher is sponsoring a resolution that would put Congress on record as 
opposing quotas that appear to discriminate against Asian-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the issue here is not affirmative action but one of equal 
opportunity for all students," said Rohrabacher in a recent letter to the Asian 
Pacific Americans in Higher Education. "Quotas and other forms of racial 
discrimination have no place in our nation's schools and, for that matter, 
anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
University officials said the proposed resolution may hamper efforts by 
colleges and universities to enroll more minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"It would appear that Mr. Rohrabacher is using this resolution as a way to get 
at affirmative action, which we obviously would totally disagree with," said 
John Cummins, assistant chancellor for public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Most colleges and universities across the nation are seeking ways to increase 
minority enrollment to prepare for demographic projections that minorities 
collectively will become the majority by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment of minority undergraduate students this fall at Bowling Green State 
University in Ohio increased 13.2% over last year. Blacks account for 4% with 
636; Latinos make up about 1% with 140, and other minorities, primarily Asians, 
have gone from 96 to 118 of the 15,978 undergraduate students. 
</P>
<P>
At the University of Michigan, minority student enrollment increased by 9.3% 
this year, from 4,991 to 5,454, a record total. Officials said Asians comprise 
6.8% of the student body (after an Asian enrollment increase of 11.1%), blacks 
6.5%, Latinos 2.8% and Native Americans 0.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The Chronicle of Higher Education said that in 1986, colleges enrolled 90,000 
Native Americans, 448,000 Asians, 624,000 Latinos, 1.1 million blacks, 9.9 
million whites and 344,000 foreign students. The schools also have instituted 
special programs to recruit and retain minorities. 
</P>
<P>
UC Berkeley officials insist that their new admissions policy merely reflects 
the state's population, while upholding high academic standards. The school 
receives about 22,000 applications for 4,000 spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Cummins said that since 1980, the state's population has increased 500,000 a 
year and that between now and the year 2000, there will be an additional 6 
million residents, mostly minority -- Hispanic and Asians particularly. 
</P>
<P>
The Asian population has grown a phenomenal 70% since 1980 and now approaches 
10% of the state's total. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Asian-Americans at UC Berkeley had the highest graduation 
rates, nearly 95% in 1987, compared with 93% for whites. Other minorities, 
including blacks and Latinos, had graduation rates in the low- to mid-80 
percentages. 
</P>
<P>
By 1991, UC Berkeley will admit 50% of its students based on grades and test 
scores alone. Currently, 40% are in this academic category. 
</P>
<P>
About 45% of the fall freshman admissions will be based on criteria other than 
academic scores alone. The other criteria will include race, disability and 
special talents, such as in music, drama and debating. 
</P>
<P>
A third category will include athletes, the poor regardless of race or 
ethnicity, and older or re-entering students. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Hayashi, who works with admissions at the university, stressed that all 
applicants still fall within the top 12.5% of high school seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people mistakenly think that our commitment to diversify our student body 
has come at the expense of our academic standards. That's simply false," 
Hayashi said. "We are doing now exactly what we've done for the past 50 years, 
selecting from the top." 
</P>
<P>
The elder Au said that before the recent changes, "it was very clear" UC 
Berkeley "had unfair practices for admissions." 
</P>
<P>
"But they are now gradually working to change that. I hope this is the 
beginning of opportunity."

STUDY FINDS LIFE'S JOLTS SPEEDS PROCESS OF AGING

Aging is characterized by abrupt declines in mental ability often caused by 
personal experiences like forced retirement or a heart attack, according to a 
long-term study that suggests some precautions. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year Seattle Longitudinal Study has tracked the intellectual ability of 
more than 4,000 people ranging in age from their 20s to their 90s. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have to do now is document scientifically what anecdotally we have 
seen all along -- that people don't age the same way," said K. Warner Shaie, 
head of Penn State University's Gerontology Center. 
</P>
<P>
Most aging studies have looked at group averages for different age groups, 
rather than tracking changes in individuals over time, Shaie said. Every seven 
years, the Seattle study researchers test five areas: verbal meaning, spatial 
orientation, inductive reasoning, and number and word fluency. 
</P>
<P>
People maintain their mental abilities, on average, into their 60s, Shaie said. 
"From then on, on average, you can find some decline." 
</P>
<P>
By 67 more than half the participants showed declines in reasoning ability, 
though verbal ability didn't decline for most until their late 70s. 
</P>
<P>
"Inductive reasoning tends to decline sooner because it involves speed of 
response," Shaie said. "Between age 20 and 60, reaction time approximately 
doubles, so any skill requiring high levels of speed is vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
Researchers recently looked at 838 participants who had suffered a significant 
drop in one or more of the five abilities over the previous seven years, and 
found a link to jarring events in their lives, such as the death of a spouse, 
Shaie said. People who are open to change and continue to learn either formally 
or informally tend to age more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more of a use-it-or-lose-it proposition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the major risk factors are an unstimulating or sedentary life, low 
education level with no effort to continue learning and heart disease, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of his research, Shaie also studied 120 people age 60 or older who had 
shown significant declines in mental ability. 
</P>
<P>
Their abilities in many cases were improved by five hours of cognitive training 
sessions, in which trainers led subjects in a series of increasingly difficult 
mental exercises. For example, to improve spatial orientation, the subjects 
were told to mentally rotate increasingly abstract objects. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you teach an old dog new tricks? The answer to that is of course you can 
teach an old dog new tricks," Shaie said.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / ALLAN H. MELTZER: NO MARSHALL PLAN FOR SOVIET UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN H. MELTZER, ALLAN H. MELTZER is John M. Olin Professor of Political 
Economy and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University and a visiting scholar 
at the American Enterprise Institute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Should we borrow from Japan and others to lend to the Soviet Union? That's what 
we would do if we followed the advice of those who urge a Marshall Plan for the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
For Eastern Europe, the case is a bit more complicated. Most of these countries 
pay imperial tribute to the Soviet Union by exporting food and manufactured 
goods in exchange for the low-quality goods that they are required to buy from 
the Soviets. Part of any help we give to Eastern Europe will be transferred to 
the Soviets in this indirect way. 
</P>
<P>
The analogy to the Marshall Plan is misleading. In 1947, Secretary of State 
George Marshall proposed a plan to aid European recovery by lending money to 
the war-devastated countries. These countries had ample skilled labor but few 
tools and little machinery with which to work. U.S. loans were used to purchase 
machine tools, road building equipment, power plants and other capital 
equipment. The workers and managers quickly learned how to use the new 
equipment. Productivity boomed. Within a few years, the war-devastated 
economies were producing for export and earning the dollars to pay off their 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
The Marshall Plan was important, but it was not the only factor in the revival 
of Western Europe. A story that may be apocryphal is told about Ludwig Erhard, 
the economics minister who deregulated the German economy in 1948 and ended 
price and wage controls. According to the story, the American general, Lucius 
Clay, told Erhard that his advisers believed that it was a mistake to remove 
controls. Erhard replied: "My advisers tell me the same thing, but I intend to 
go ahead anyway." Of course, Erhard was right. 
</P>
<P>
Deregulation, free markets and the Marshall Plan were reintroduced to an 
economy with a long history of property rights and ownership. There was a court 
system to enforce contracts and a tradition of having them enforced. A 
commercial code was in place specifying the rights and obligations of buyers 
and sellers. An accounting system properly recorded values, gains and losses. 
The benefits of freedom were widely understood and appreciated. So was the 
discipline to accept the outcome of the market process. 
</P>
<P>
The requisite legal and institutional framework does not exist in the Soviet 
Union and in large parts of Eastern Europe. Freeing an economy means more than 
just letting prices of goods and labor be set in markets. People must be able 
to invest and plan with reasonable confidence that the rules of the game will 
not shift about at the whim of some planner or official. Contracts, agreements 
and rights to property and income must be enforced, and people must perceive 
that they will be enforced. Confiscation of gains either directly or by 
arbitrary changes in taxation must be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
The problem can be solved most easily in East Germany by adopting West German 
law and enforcement. None of these traditions exist in Poland or the Soviet 
Union, and there does not appear to be much understanding of their importance. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the economies of the Soviet Union and much of Eastern Europe are in a 
much different position from those of Western Europe in 1947. Many factories 
are poorly located and inefficient. Some will have to be closed because they 
cannot compete under any foreseeable configuration of costs and product prices. 
Some workers and managers will face unemployment and lower real incomes, at 
least for a time. None of these basic changes were required in Western Europe 
at the time of the Marshall Plan. 
</P>
<P>
The difference is important. No matter how good our intentions, and theirs, 
loans or aid will not help, and may hinder, Eastern Europeans if they are used 
to maintain inefficient plants. The loans would merely subsidize inefficiency 
and delay the changes that are required to meet the market test. Until a 
credible reform program with vested property rights, a commercial code, a 
reliable accounting system, and free markets in products, capital and labor 
services is in place, there is a good chance that loans will be used to 
maintain the status quo or delay adjustment. The countries will have more debt 
but not higher productivity and more output to service the debt. 
</P>
<P>
There is a further problem in lending to the Soviet Union and, because 
resources are transferred, in lending to Eastern Europe. The most efficient 
part of the Soviet economy produces for the military. One of the Soviets' main 
problems, but also their best opportunity, is to transfer production from 
military to non-military uses. That's why the Soviet Union seeks detente and 
disarmament. It is in our interest to encourage the transfer to non-military 
uses by demonstrating our willingness to reduce our military spending as they 
reduce theirs. 
</P>
<P>
A Marshall Plan for the Soviet Union works against our interest. The more 
external support they get, the less they have to transfer from their own 
military production to improve their economy. Our interest, the interest of a 
peaceful world and the interest of the nations in Eastern Europe is to have the 
largest possible reduction in Soviet military spending at home and abroad in 
places such as Cuba, Nicaragua, Syria, the Indian Ocean and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there is the problem of financing the plan. In 1947, the United States 
had a large surplus of exports over imports. The Marshall Plan recycled the 
cash flow that we received from abroad. Now we're net borrowers. We sell our 
assets and debt to countries such as Japan. 
</P>
<P>
A Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union would mean loans to 
Eastern Europe financed by asset sales to Japan and others. The original 
Marshall Plan helped to finance the development of the peaceful, market 
economies of Western Europe. The new Marshall Plan would likely delay rather 
than accelerate the transfer of the 20% or 25% share of the Soviet economy 
taken by the Soviet military. 
</P>
<P>
We should welcome the Soviet Union and the Eastern Europeans as trading 
partners in non-strategic goods and services. But we help them and ourselves 
most by encouraging them to solve their internal problems on their own.

JAPANESE MANAGEMENT: GOOD OR BAD?; 
</P>
<P>
MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT JAPANESE MANAGEMENT AND WORKPLACE PRACTICES. BUT WHAT 
IS IT REALLY LIKE TO WORK FOR JAPAN INC.? HAS THE COUNTRY'S SUCCESS BEEN 
ACHIEVED AT A COST TO ITS WORKERS? GARY J. KATZENSTEIN AND RICHARD O'NEILL 
RECENTLY SPENT MONTHS WORKING ON FELLOWSHIPS AT SONY CORP. IN JAPAN. THE TWO 
CAME AWAY WITH VASTLY DIFFERENT IMPRESSIONS.; 
</P>
<P>
ENCOURAGED: O'NEILL COMPARES JAPANESE MANAGEMENT STYLE TO THAT PRACTICED BY 
AMERICAN FIRMS IN THE 1950S. HE BELIEVES ATTITUDES ARE CHANGING, JUST AS THEY 
DID HERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'NEILL, RICHARD O'NEILL, president of the Persona Consulting Group 
of Santa Monica, liked his experience enough that he continues to work with 
Sony on an independent basis and helps recruit executives for them. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlike Gary, who went afoul of Sony's personnel department, I was specifically 
assigned to work with it, and found it obliging, open and powerful. Gary got 
dismissed with his impolitic behavior. I got the "open kimono" because my 
agenda was to study, not stand in judgment. 
</P>
<P>
To counterpoint Gary, I found nothing egregious about Japanese executives' 
being reassigned to a new job on short notice. Japanese practices are not 
unique; they simply lag behind the United States by some 20 to 30 years. I 
recall very clearly a cold Midwestern night in 1959 when my father (an upwardly 
mobile corporate executive) came home to say that on Monday, we could, if we 
chose, get promoted to Atlanta. My mother, due in two weeks to bear her fifth 
child, recognized that flexibility and sacrifice would serve her interests 
well, and immediately tackled the trials ahead. We moved, and prospered. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson is this: In the 1980s' Japan, as in the 1950s' United States, those 
with drive and ambition accept relocation as a price of personal success. The 
idea that Japanese executives move because they are Kafkaesque automatons 
ignores the fact that people, then as today, relocate because they want and 
choose to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Gary complains that the Japanese job rotation produces generalists with "thin 
knowledge bases" rather than specialists, but the clear fact is that job 
rotation (the practice of cross-training talent through sales, research, 
personnel, manufacturing and so on) is a superior management development 
strategy. The "bench strength" of companies that practice rotation (the most 
successful U.S., Japanese and European companies) is formidable, with many 
seasoned managers capable of building cross-disciplinary consensus and fueling 
the growth engine. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, at Sony Japan (and Sony U.S.) there are world-class researchers who 
follow specialist career paths, but the labs are closely linked with the 
factories (increasingly at Sony U.S.), so they never lose a sense of how to 
build what they design. 
</P>
<P>
And what about Japanese women? In my time at Sony (1982), the women seemed 
pretty neatly constrained by what we could call "feudal" career opportunities: 
teas, telephones, translation and, with luck, marriage to a promising young 
engineer followed by bearing children. 
</P>
<P>
But this is not very different from U.S. practices of three decades ago, nor 
European practices today. But times are changing fast everywhere. Recently, a 
key female marketing talent in a Japanese firm here in Los Angeles flatly 
refused a transfer back to Osaka. The company, pragmatically (and with few 
options), altered its plans and course to accommodate this needed talent. 
</P>
<P>
My friend Peter Drucker, just back from his annual consulting tour of Japan, 
told me recently about the surprisingly rapid (and recent) ascent of women into 
critical management positions. The lesson here is a simple one: Japanese 
business is quickly adapting to a global shortage of talent. Today, you 
discriminate against women at your peril. 
</P>
<P>
WASPish 19th-Century Wall Street once sought to keep out the Irish, Jews, 
Italians and others, but when trade started to walk new streets, the old-line 
financial companies adapted or perished. Women on the rise in today's Japan are 
a matter of necessity, not virtue. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of free labor market alternatives in Japan is a discredited myth; 
Japanese do change companies. When I was interviewing my way through Sony 
headquarters, I met a 28-year-old electronics engineer who confided that he 
previously worked at a larger electronics company until recruited away by Sony. 
My friends in the personnel department, confronted with this "un-Japanese" 
fact, let on that, indeed, Sony would recruit from the outside the talent they 
couldn't grow inside. They arranged for me to spend a day with the key managers 
of Japan's top personnel placement company, which was growing at a 
2,000%-a-year clip in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake, "ostracism" for being "different" is still common in the 
ferociously competitive internal environment of Japanese firms. The logic is 
that you grab at anything to get ahead of your internal competition. A friend 
of mine at Sony wore a mustache at great personal risk, and he opined that his 
dream was to spend more time in the company of his wife, playing cards and 
helping out with the children's education. He was clearly under pressure to 
conform, but no more so than, say, the pressure that existed for wearing a 
non-white shirt at 1960 IBM. 
</P>
<P>
Even today, IBMers get ahead by conforming to the competitive rules of internal 
culture. But should we criticize IBM for lacking "humanistic values?" No. We 
should praise IBM for creating jobs and providing leadership. By definition, 
the individual within a corporation makes sacrifices for the common good. 
Corporations survive because of it. And today, frankly, the under-30 cohort at 
Sony will talk openly of jumping ship, seeing that the organizational pyramid 
has flattened across the globe. They are beginning to focus their formidable 
talent and energy on entrepreneurial opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
So the lesson and challenge to enterprises is that you "ostracize" 
non-traditional behaviors only if you can afford to lose talent to the growing 
opportunities outside the company. 
</P>
<P>
Sony was not a worker's paradise, but the net effects of the Sony system are 
worth studying and understanding. For example, Sony had a fairly far-reaching 
"welfare" function within its personnel department. Sony employees got 
allowances for housing, food, transportation, having children and other needs, 
as well as health care, retirement funds and an aggressive continuing education 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Where did the money come from to pay for these? From the sacrifices of the 
individuals to a pool of collective capital, such that the company also had the 
financial strength to withstand cyclic downturns, design failures, supplier or 
customer collapses. Sony worldwide takes great financial hits to avoid laying 
off people by moving, reassigning, retraining. Nobody mandated or legislated 
these policies; the company built them on the collective assent and sacrifices 
of its people. 
</P>
<P>
I take exception to Gary's conclusion that if you're not Japanese, you're out. 
Certainly the "glass ceiling" for non-Japanese has existed in Japanese 
companies as it existed for non-Americans in U.S. companies 30 years ago, but 
as in the United States, it's proving fast to be a short-sighted policy. 
</P>
<P>
Sony has taken more risks in the United States and Europe than any Japanese 
company at bringing non-Japanese into key positions. The recent acquisitions of 
CBS Records and Columbia Pictures were the results of Americans with long 
tenure and unimpeachable position in Sony America. They earned both real power 
and real enemies within Sony headquarters in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Other Japanese companies that take fewer risks look enviously to Sony's 
successes (and failures) at localizing their top management. Globally, the 
caldron of change and power transfer is churning rapidly, such that those who 
will not adapt are in for trouble, whereas the flexible adaptive enterprise -- 
of whatever nation of origin -- will inherit the future.

U.S. NAVY SHOULD ADOPT THE COST-SAVING MISSILE DEVICE DEVELOPED BY MICRONICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to point out an additional item not mentioned in the story about 
Micronics ("Micronics vs. the Pentagon," Oct. 29). 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Precision Aerotech purchased Micronics in 1987, it became 
apparent that someone had to adopt a more sensible approach to the Phoenix 
missile problem. The directors of Precision Aerotech elected to fully fund, at 
its own expense, the complete redesign of the "safe and arming" device. 
</P>
<P>
This new design was 40% cheaper than the original Navy design, and it could be 
assembled in the volume necessary to get the Phoenix program back on track. The 
completed article was presented on Aug. 24. Four weeks later, Micronics was 
closed down, and our solution to a decade of program mismanagement by the Navy 
slipped into a void. 
</P>
<P>
I write this letter for two reasons. First, it should be noted that Precision 
Aerotech was quick to show good faith by investing its own funds and personnel 
at Micronics to solve the problem. Secondly, while Precision Aerotech will 
never own and operate Micronics again, the Navy should use the redesigned safe 
and arming device today. It will save the American taxpayers millions of 
dollars and permit the Navy to arm Phoenix missiles now rather than wait two 
years to develop an unproven alternate source.

</P>
<P>
For example, American physicists have common ground -- interest in their 
science -- with their East Bloc counterparts, even if the latter were in the 
past forced into a government mold in their research. Cartographers have a 
common interest in their techniques, even if Soviet maps have been notorious 
(and often comical) for their deliberate distortions. Sculptors and painters 
have a common concern with art, even if East Bloc artists have been pressured 
into conforming to communist themes. 
</P>
<P>
But who are the Soviet counterparts of American union leaders and what are the 
common areas of interest? Surely, no one is proposing that exchanges be about 
steel making, oil drilling, machine shop work, carpentry and so on. The 
"business" of AFL-CIO leaders is empowerment of workers in a union movement for 
economic and social democracy through collective bargaining and other kinds of 
activism. 
</P>
<P>
The "leaders" imposed by the Communist Party and government on their labor 
fronts are not in that business. And their counterfeit imitations of unions are 
not unions by any rational definition. Even calling them unions legitimizes 
them -- a trap into which Bernstein falls. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Polish Solidarity is truly a union movement. It deserves the 
enthusiastic and unflagging support it has been receiving from the AFL-CIO. 
Others striving to build genuine independent unions in the East bloc have also 
been getting aid. And as totalitarianism crumbles, some individuals from other 
organizational entities may defect to authentic union groups and will need 
fraternal good will and assistance. But heads of the counterfeit unions have no 
particularly distinctive affinity for genuine unionism.

'VINELAND' ENDS THOMAS PYNCHON'S LITERARY SILENCE, BUT NOT MYSTERY

"I just needed a vacation from my life. You never heard of that?" -- From 
Thomas Pynchon's "Vineland" 
</P>
<P>
One of the longer literary silences of modern times will come to an end this 
week with the release of 100,000 copies of "Vineland," Thomas Pynchon's eagerly 
awaited and closely guarded new novel. 
</P>
<P>
In "Gravity's Rainbow," his 17-year-old previous effort -- still touted by some 
high-powered fans as quite possibly the greatest American novel of the century 
-- there's a metaphor that explains what will happen: "A screaming comes across 
the sky." 
</P>
<P>
That, in one of the most famous first sentences of American literature since 
"Call me Ishmael," is how the novel begins, with the descent of one of Hitler's 
V-2 bombs onto London. 
</P>
<P>
But these rockets travel faster than the speed of sound: If you can hear a V-2 
coming in, that means it must already have landed elsewhere, and you're safe. 
Whereas if you hear nothing, you may soon be dead. 
</P>
<P>
First, as one critic put it, the annihilation. Then the warning. 
</P>
<P>
So it is with "Vineland." 
</P>
<P>
No galleys were issued to reviewers or foreign publishers, the first time 
anyone can remember this being done with a novel. Everyone will be making their 
minds up at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
That, at least, was the way it was supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as sometimes happens with these things, samizdat (clandestine) manuscripts 
are surfacing. At least three unauthorized readers -- all real Pynchon buffs -- 
profess themselves disappointed, meaning either their expectations were too 
high or that it's not an easy task to follow up what is quite possibly the 
greatest American etc. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more damning is the fact that none of the three had finished it yet. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it seems to be trying to send up contemporary California culture, 
which is a topic that's certainly been done and done and done," says one of 
these fans. "The Pynchon I like best is very highly wrought, multilayered, 
embedded with puns and metaphors. Everything has more than one possible 
meaning, which is where the paranoia comes from. But 'Vineland' seems lacking 
in that ambiguity and wit, with too much of his hep-cat attitudinizing." 
</P>
<P>
Others disagree. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a book that isn't comparable to much of anything," says David Willis 
McCullough, one of the Book-of-the-Month-Club judges who chose it as a main 
selection. "I think we're far enough away from the '60s now that even people 
who aren't nostalgic are curious. It's sort of, 'What did you do in the great 
'60s, Daddy?' And 'Vineland' seems a marvelous farewell to that era." 
</P>
<P>
The title comes from mythical Vineland County in Northern California, scene of 
much of the action. 
</P>
<P>
In a roundabout way, this is a novel about the war on drugs, although it 
probably won't do much to brighten Drug Czar William Bennett's Christmas. 
Everyone wants to ice thuggish federal prosecutor Brock Vond, and for Vond -- 
who deploys the largest assemblage of paramilitary forces this side of Tom 
Clancy -- the feeling is mutual. 
</P>
<P>
Zoyd Wheeler is the hero. He's an off-beat type who once each year jumps 
through a Vineland storefront window, just for the hell of it, and spends much 
of his free time obsessing "about his wife -- he never would get too 
comfortable with 'ex-wife' -- and managing to bum out everybody inside a radius 
even these days considered respectable." 
</P>
<P>
He used to play the lounge piano for Kahuna Airlines, a very deregulated 
operation where the passengers arriving in Honolulu weren't always the same as 
those departing Los Angeles. Yes, it's that kind of novel. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should things be easy to understand?" Pynchon once supposedly asked a 
friend, but in "Vineland" he seems to have succumbed to the urge. You can 
already hear the reviewers sniffing wounded prey. Thomas Pynchon's long-awaited 
novel wasn't worth the wait. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Yet even if the critics vote thumbs down, those 100,000 copies will still sell 
on the mystery of the man himself. The betting in the literary community is 
that, no matter how good or bad "Vineland" is, it will be the season's 
fashionable novel -- the one to leave strategically on your coffee table and to 
casually mention at cocktail parties. 
</P>
<P>
It's the appeal of the concealed. In an age when everyone sooner or later shows 
up on "Nightline" or "Donahue," Pynchon has achieved the remarkable trick of 
becoming progressively less visible. 
</P>
<P>
As long ago as his first novel, "V." (1963), he was a fuzzy, blurry, barely 
discernible image, one who led Life magazine photographers on a fruitless chase 
through the wilds of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's gone off the screen entirely. 
</P>
<P>
The last published picture is in his 1953 high-school yearbook; the most recent 
personal details date from the mid-'70s. In the 1980s, not one verifiable fact 
has materialized. 
</P>
<P>
Is it true he has no possessions and sleeps on the floor at the homes of his 
friends and agent? That he will spend hours or days researching, say, the best 
kind of brick, and will visit the river bank in Philadelphia where the clay 
comes from just so he can refer to it with assurance? That he once stocked his 
kitchen not with groceries but empty Hills Brothers coffee cans? That, back in 
the '60s, he made off with writer Jules Siegel's wife, as Siegel complained at 
great length in the pages of Playboy? Or that, when you take away being a great 
writer, there's almost nothing interesting about him? And just why the heck is 
he this way, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
Add all the rumors up and you have a picture of an obsessive, cunning, 
determined writer, one who not surprisingly has chosen paranoia as his chief 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
Pynchon doesn't want to be traced and has gone to every effort to make it 
impossible to do so. 
</P>
<P>
If his life can't be known, however, it's still possible to measure his shadow. 
</P>
<P>
This story, then, isn't so much about Pynchon as his effect on John Calvin 
Batchelor, one of many awaiting the new book, one of a number of novelists 
influenced by the last. 
</P>
<P>
The career of Batchelor, respected but little known, began with a series of 
articles in an obscure New York weekly back in 1976 and '77. The thesis: Thomas 
Pynchon was and always had been a pseudonym for the second most-secretive 
writer in America, J.D. Salinger. 
</P>
<P>
In a Cuban restaurant near Columbia University, Batchelor picks up a copy of 
"Gravity's Rainbow," which even in paperback is the size of a couple of bricks. 
One clue, he notes, involves the poets Emily Dickinson and Rainer Maria Rilke. 
</P>
<P>
"Both are Salinger's heroes, and both are in here," he says, pointing to the 
copyright page, where the only two writers acknowledged are Dickinson and 
Rilke. "Salinger saw himself as retiring up there in New Hampshire, the same 
way Dickinson had. It all clicked." 
</P>
<P>
It makes a certain amount of sense. 
</P>
<P>
When Pynchon published his first two stories in 1959, the already-reclusive 
Salinger was in an extremely uncomfortable position: sought out by his adoring 
fans while simultaneously strafed by the critics. 
</P>
<P>
"A nom de plume," Batchelor wrote in the Soho News, "now afforded Salinger the 
anonymity he had sought but failed to find as Caulfield's creator. It was the 
perfect cover." 
</P>
<P>
And there was Salinger saying sometime after he published a long story in the 
New Yorker in 1965 (still his last printed work) that "he was writing fine, 
don't worry about him, he was writing about his war experiences. And it just so 
happened that 'Gravity's Rainbow' was about the same kind of war experiences 
Salinger had. This is very creepy, but Salinger was a member of a four-man 
counterintelligence squad, and his job at the end of the war was to interrogate 
German soldiers. He was looking for SS and Gestapo and other outlaws. And in 
'Gravity's Rainbow' one of the things that is done is to interrogate a former 
German officer." 
</P>
<P>
There's much more, but this no doubt is enough. "Sweet, but crazy," was one 
reporter's verdict on Batchelor at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind, though, that Salinger hadn't been heard from in a decade, that 
exactly nothing was known about Pynchon, and that stranger things have 
happened. Moreover, Batchelor, fresh from Scottish divinity school, had the 
virtue of sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
"At no point did I not think I was right," he says. "That's how inside the 
story I was. I proceeded with gravity. Soberly. I talked to all parties again 
and again. I told them what I was doing. I wanted them to tell me I was wrong. 
No one would." 
</P>
<P>
As a device for finding out facts about Pynchon, it also worked well. 
Batchelor's articles revealed more than any up to that time. He found the 
novelist's editor, his publisher, agent, and the judges who voted to give him 
the National Book Award, the Faulkner Prize, the Pulitzer, the Howells Medal 
(given to the most distinguished work of fiction to be published in a five-year 
period). 
</P>
<P>
It was the first writing Batchelor had done. He didn't even have a phone. He 
called people such as New York Times book reviewer Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, 
high-brow critics Elizabeth Hardwick and Benjamin DeMott, and New Yorker editor 
William Shawn (whose secretary blocked the call) from a pay phone in the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't know," Batchelor says, then corrects himself: "Well, sometimes 
they did. I had to drop in another dime." 
</P>
<P>
When "Nightline" wanted a successful but poor writer a couple years ago to put 
on opposite Stephen King, Batchelor was chosen. 
</P>
<P>
Now 41, he looks ascetic, determined, a 24-hour-a-day writer, although in truth 
he recently got married to a minister and they are expecting a child. 
</P>
<P>
His novels share the same baroque, fertile mind-set that could conceive of and 
believe in Salinger and Pynchon being one. 
</P>
<P>
First was a satirical jape on Halley's comet; his second can be explained by 
the title, "The Birth of the People's Republic of Antarctica." The third, 
"American Falls," is a Civil War tale that the Washington Post, in a front-page 
Book World review, called "unusual, brilliant and compelling." 
</P>
<P>
"It must have been the times," Batchelor explained in a letter. "In '73, Nixon 
was swinging hard. The year started like a farce gone black and blue. In 
January, Solzhenitsyn risked everything again, agreeing that the YMCA Press 
should publish 'Gulag.' Tass called him anti-Soviet and pro-Tsarist. Three 
weeks later, L.B.J. died and the court passed down Roe vs. Wade and Kissinger 
announced the Vietnam peace accord. . . . In spring, Pynchon issued "GR" in a 
$15 (!) hardback edition. Then John Dean took the stand. In the same week in 
October, the Saturday Night Massacre and our yellow alert for the Yom Kippur 
War. Then the Mets came from behind to take the division, pennant and almost 
the Series. Tug McGraw said it best, 'Ya gotta believe.' " 
</P>
<P>
Batchelor, and many others, believed in Pynchon after "Gravity's Rainbow." 
</P>
<P>
But faith wasn't rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a lot out of him. That old bugaboo about 'write what you know' -- he 
made it 'write what you imagine,' " says Batchelor. "Tom Pynchon was a great 
hero to me, and then he wandered off. He could have helped us. We've had a 
tough time the past 17 years writing books. What is the satisfaction if you 
don't have a fraternity?" 
</P>
<P>
By not publishing any fiction for 17 years, Batchelor argues, Pynchon cut 
himself off from the generation of novelists who had grown up with him. 
</P>
<P>
Pynchon was 35 when "Gravity's Rainbow" appeared; he's 52 now. 
</P>
<P>
"That's an enormously prolific period for any novelist. In Pynchon there's a 
lot of immaturity, and he would have been able to work it out. But now, it's 
like Nixon's 18-minute gap. You know what should be there, but you don't feel 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was Pynchon's own belief in himself that faltered. The new novel, 
with its anti-yuppie bias and reference to the Ronald Reagan era, seems to have 
been composed in the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
What happened to the books he was supposedly writing in the mid-'70s, one a 
novel about the Mason-Dixon line and the other involving Japanese monster 
movies? 
</P>
<P>
Batchelor's theory -- and it makes as much sense as anyone's -- is that 
Pynchon, a man who has been writing at least since high school, simply got 
lost. He fell too deep into the dream. 
</P>
<P>
It's something Batchelor, after three years in the mid-'80s working on a novel 
about the Russian moon program that featured exclusively Russian characters, 
knows all about. 
</P>
<P>
"I see," he says of his still-unpublished book, "that what I did was go so far 
into the dream that there was nobody else with me. It's something you have to 
be careful of." 
</P>
<P>
The same thing happened with the Pynchon-Salinger fantasia. In summer, 1977, 
Batchelor got a letter from Pynchon, written on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer stationery 
and containing the only public encouragement the writer has ever given to those 
seeking him out: "Some of it is true, but none of the interesting parts. Keep 
trying. I had never heard of your paper, and one needs news." 
</P>
<P>
This is assuming, of course, that the letter wasn't someone's idea of a joke. 
</P>
<P>
Batchelor says he compared it with other Pynchon signatures (there are only a 
few) and it checks out. Either way, it caused him to stop believing Pynchon was 
Salinger. "I was back on Planet Earth. It was 1977, and I had been to a 
wonderful place, and I had been the only one there." 
</P>
<P>
Pynchon's new novel, published by Little, Brown, is outside the dream too, in a 
way that "Gravity's Rainbow" wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Seven hundred and sixty pages long, "Rainbow" has several hundred characters 
and hardly any plot. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most appropriate critical comments came last fall from a sophomore 
at Princeton, Drayton Nabors. "It's the weirdest book I ever read," he told a 
reporter after a marathon reading. "I love it. Someday I'll even finish it." 
</P>
<P>
Readers of "Vineland" shouldn't have similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
Batchelor, for one, is looking forward to it. "I hope," he says, "that it means 
he's going to write again." 
</P>
<P>
After the troubles with the Russian moon book, Batchelor is also publishing. 
His upcoming novel, "Gordon Liddy Is My Muse," is his most accessible, one that 
touches on subjects of both perennial interest (unrepentant Watergate 
conspirator Liddy, Hollywood devouring writers, writers devouring other 
writers) and contemporary headlines (the German problem, the Soviet problem). 
</P>
<P>
When he thinks about Thomas Pynchon now, the image that remains is from the 
slide show that Mr. and Mrs. Richard Farina Sr. gave him in their Queens home 
back in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
They were the parents of Richard Farina, the more-than-promising writer who was 
killed in 1966, two days after the publication of his first novel, "Been Down 
So Long It Looks Like Up to Me." The colorful Farina and the more reserved 
Pynchon were best friends back at Cornell. The dedication of "Gravity's 
Rainbow" reads simply: "For Richard Farina." 
</P>
<P>
The slides were from Farina's wedding to Mimi Baez, sister of Joan, in 1963. 
"They were color slides, Kodachrome," Batchelor remembers. "She was loading 
them one at a time in this little tiny room. The only sound was the humming of 
the fan. Seeing Pynchon, she would say, 'Oh, there's Tom! There he is, and 
there's Dick.' " 
</P>
<P>
Pynchon was this very tall, ungainly-looking young man, who was at the wedding 
of his glamorous friend, Dick Farina, who was marrying into the glamorous 
Baezes in a very hip California house overlooking the coast. 
</P>
<P>
In the early '60s, you couldn't get more fashionable than this. Every leftist 
cause in California centered in this home. 
</P>
<P>
But Pynchon was just this young man, hanging around at the wedding. He had a 
coat and tie on, tried to look proper, was humble and modest. He was not larger 
than life, not a legend, not even a legend-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first time I had ever seen a picture of him," says Batchelor. 
"Before that, he was so far away I couldn't glimpse him. I could feel being 
there -- to be nobody in a party of very big somebodies. I could feel what it's 
like being outside the hip, and wanting to know if I mattered, too. It made me 
like him. I saw how you could get to 'Gravity's Rainbow' from a place like 
that. You didn't have to come up with some enormous theory of genius at birth. 
It was hard work, but it didn't come from nowhere."

ERMA BOMBECK: TIMELY LESSON ON AIRPORT ARRIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a season of airports. Half of you reading this column will be arriving 
in them from somewhere. The other half of you will be meeting someone there. It 
is important for you to know how airlines work. 
</P>
<P>
Many of you who are meeting planes will call the airport before you leave home 
to find out if the flight is on time. If it makes you feel better, by all means 
do call. But please know that no one will answer the phone. The monitor at the 
airport, no matter what time of the day or night you check it, will always list 
your plane on the "final approach" or "on time." 
</P>
<P>
"On time" is a real enigma. When people complained that planes were notoriously 
late, the airlines did some creative scheduling to correct the situation. They 
just added 30 minutes to all their arrival times. A flight that normally takes 
50 minutes now shows 80 minutes, so that when it arrives "on time," you're not 
sure if it is the "real" time it takes to fly or the padded time that is logged 
for the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
Timing is everything when you are meeting people at the airport. You cannot be 
too early or too late. If you are early and enjoying the luxury of breathing 
normally and perhaps reading a newspaper, there will invariably be a 
last-minute gate change that will necessitate your catching a shuttle and going 
to another terminal. If you arrive "on time," there is the strong possibility 
that the plane is arriving on the "real" time and didn't need the padded time. 
In that event, do not pass security and collect your car keys out of the dish; 
go directly to baggage claim. 
</P>
<P>
I fly a lot, and over the years I've heard some of the most creative reasons in 
the world for planes arriving late. "Bad weather" is a goldie oldie. However, 
bad weather never is a problem at the gate. It occurs only after you are on the 
airplane and holding, sealed away from a phone and other planes. Another reason 
is, "We're waiting for late-arriving baggage to be boarded." (When pigs fly, 
they wait for baggage.) 
</P>
<P>
"Someone left a cargo door open" gives you a warm glow, as does, "We seem to be 
missing a crew." A few weeks ago, I was detained a half-hour when our plane 
became surgically attached to a jetport. 
</P>
<P>
There's not a whole lot you can do about the hours spent at airports. Flying is 
still the quickest and probably the safest way to travel. I just kick back and 
people-watch. Every once in a while, you'll get a smile from a first-time 
flier, like the one a few weeks ago who alighted pale, disheveled and shaken, 
lamenting: "It was terrible up there. The captain said we had a tail wind all 
the way!"

CATHOLIC THINK TANK COMBINES FAITH, JUSTICE; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: THE CENTER OF CONCERN IS DEDICATED TO SOLVING WORLD PROBLEMS WITH 
INSPIRATION AND EXPERTISE.

<TEXT>
<P>
There's nothing about the big white clapboard house in the family-oriented 
neighborhood of northeast Washington to suggest that its occupants are out to 
change the world. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 17 years, that has been precisely the goal of the Center of 
Concern, a kind of Roman Catholic think tank dedicated to solving worldwide 
problems of injustice by throwing expertise and religious commitment at them. 
</P>
<P>
"We're bleeding-heart liberals, but we do our homework," said Father James Hug, 
director of the center. 
</P>
<P>
"From the earliest beginnings of the center, we have tried to bring a faith 
perspective to the cause of justice," said Father Peter Henriot, who was 
director until leaving earlier this year for a yearlong sabbatical in Africa. 
"It is not simply a matter of linking faith and justice, but of seeing that the 
one is incomplete without the other." 
</P>
<P>
In the 17 years since the Center of Concern was founded with the joint backing 
of the Society of Jesus and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, it has 
played a significant role in the church's social justice ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Through books, pamphlets, study guides, videotapes, seminars, workshops, 
symposiums and consultations, the center has provided expertise and inspiration 
to a wide range of people and on a variety of topics. 
</P>
<P>
With a senior staff of six, the center last year produced 10 books and four 
videotapes and led or participated in nearly a score of conferences and 
seminars on topics ranging from the international debt crisis to an exploration 
of women's liberation. 
</P>
<P>
"Our agenda emerges out of the sense of need and the interest of people on the 
staff," said Hug. 
</P>
<P>
One example of the center's work was the role staff members played in the 
Catholic bishops' pastoral on economics, from start to finish. Four center 
staff members participated at the preliminary hearings held to help shape the 
pastoral, Hug said. 
</P>
<P>
Then the center was asked to critique the first draft of the pastoral. "We were 
told our critique had the single greatest influence" on the final draft, Hug 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Once the final document was released, Hug did a condensed version of the 
pastoral for wide distribution in the churches, and Henriot produced a 
videotape on it. 
</P>
<P>
"By not being a part of the (bishops') conference, but by being the friendly 
critic, we were able to have a strong influence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A key part of the center's aim currently, he said, is the development of 
networks -- the putting together of people and groups with common concerns. 
"There is a real need for global collaboration," he said, "a growing sense that 
we have to be able to collaborate with people in different parts of the world. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
"We try to see ourselves as brokers, putting together people from other parts 
of the world with key people in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the center's activities are rigorously cerebral. Every year, in what 
has become a welcome tradition, the staff throws a big "y'all come" potluck 
picnic for the scores of people -- Protestant as well as Catholic -- in the 
nation's capital who work on behalf of social justice. 
</P>
<P>
It is a welcome opportunity for people with common goals and similar 
perspectives to renew old friendships and make new ones. 
</P>
<P>
The guest list for the picnic is not screened as carefully as, say, a White 
House dinner, and one year the invitation was inadvertently read on a local 
radio station. "I thought there were an awful lot of people I didn't know," 
Henriot said, recalling the confusion. 
</P>
<P>
But the burgers and baked beans kept coming, and everyone got fed. 
</P>
<P>
While founded by the Jesuits and the bishops' conference, the center remains 
independent of both -- "a central player in the mix without being part of it," 
the director said. 
</P>
<P>
Its budget, currently just over $600,000, comes from individual contributions, 
fees for lectures and other staff services, and from educational outreach 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Henriot sees some irony in the fact that the house that now accommodates the 
Center of Concern, with all of its liberal, post-Vatican II ideas, was 
previously occupied by a group of Mexican nuns who had been brought here to 
serve as cooks at a nearby seminary, now defunct. 
</P>
<P>
Over every window in the house the nuns had nailed up colorful portrayals of 
the bleeding sacred heart of Jesus, a devotional symbol in high favor with some 
conservative Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
The nuns "put them up as protection against break-ins," Henriot explained. It 
was an expression of spirituality not appreciated by the urbane and 
sophisticated Jesuits, who promptly took them down. 
</P>
<P>
"Within a week, we were broken into," he said.

The entire relationship came down to a cheese grater. 
</P>
<P>
Bill and Becky Curry were married barely six months when they found their dream 
house, which meant it was time to sacrifice some of their personal belongings 
for the common good. 
</P>
<P>
A 33-year-old flight attendant when she married, Becky had already set up a 
household she adored. Her antiques and overstuffed faded chairs were her 
friends. Same with Bill, a Pepco executive who at 38 was that rare fellow who 
actually knew his way around a Cuisinart and couldn't wait to get his own 
spatula out of storage. 
</P>
<P>
Those first few days of wrangling over whose frying pan would stay and whose 
mixing bowls would go were not their best. Still, they plodded along, 
determined to preserve their image of themselves as a happy couple. 
</P>
<P>
Around Day 3, however, the pretense crumbled over two flimsy metal cheese 
graters. 
</P>
<P>
His was new, shiny, quadrangular and could grate cheese four different ways. 
His mother had one just like it. There was no other way. 
</P>
<P>
Hers was flat and practical and would store easily. She had picked it up at an 
antiques shop and it was like an old sweater. How many different ways did you 
need to shred Cheddar anyway? 
</P>
<P>
He yelled, she cried. He stormed, she threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, simply worn down, she tossed out her grater. She's never shredded a 
piece of cheese since. They've been married six years. It never occurred to 
them to keep both graters. 
</P>
<P>
"That just wasn't an option -- this was a win-lose issue," Becky Curry says 
today. "I was really dumbfounded that a kitchen implement would even matter to 
him, but he was feeling pushed aside . . . I learned not to assume anything." 
</P>
<P>
"Now, whenever we strongly disagree, we recollect the day of the cheese 
grater," Bill Curry says. "That's when we know it's time to compromise. Or 
avoid discussion." 
</P>
<P>
This is not a story about dating or breaking up. It's about commitment, about 
making a decision that you will be part of a couple even though the love of 
your life would rather read fiction alone than party with your friends. 
</P>
<P>
It's about being in love but wondering how you'll ever get through the holidays 
because she insists on buying an artificial Christmas tree and all your holiday 
memories are tied up in the smell of pine. 
</P>
<P>
It's about little things with big meanings: personal tastes and styles that are 
so deeply ingrained in your personality that, at times, solitude is more 
appealing than compromise. 
</P>
<P>
This is a story about becoming a couple when you're over 30 and not a kid 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"A cheese grater is just a thing which happened to represent much, much more," 
says Isaiah Zimmerman, a Washington psychologist who specializes in couples and 
family therapy. "It was a battle to determine who was in charge and whose life 
style was more worthy. 
</P>
<P>
"It is extraordinarily hard after 30 to commit oneself to a joint life when you 
truly believe it will not outweigh the benefits of an imagined individual 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Becoming a new couple is a fight at any age. Those blissful early days when 
everyone is on their best behavior quickly give way to constant negotiation, 
arbitration and mediation. And the closer one gets to 30 (and beyond), the 
steeper the hill to climb, say therapists and couples. 
</P>
<P>
For one, by mating later, couples have that much more time to decide who they 
are and what they don't want to be. According to figures from the National 
Center for Health Statistics, and the Census Bureau, the average age for a 
first marriage has crept up over the past 40 years -- from 20 to about 23 for 
women, and from 22 to about 24 for men. This number is generally higher when 
both are urban professionals. 
</P>
<P>
And while maturity may breed confidence, it also encourages rigidity. "You just 
want to relax," says one 36-year-old journalist. "You don't want to please as 
much. Instead of trying five new things, you'll try one. You're not going take 
up skiing just to be with the person, because you might break your leg." 
</P>
<P>
On the plus side, individuals tend to discard heavy parental baggage and 
expectations past 30, and become much more receptive to coupling with their 
opposite number instead of with a clone of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
But in turn, they also develop their own intrusive quirks. The bigger issues, 
which may have disrupted a relationship at 22, are replaced by seemingly petty 
concerns about neatness, promptness or what to cook for Christmas dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"He may say, 'OK, I don't care as much about religion -- you can raise the kids 
Catholic,' " says Zimmerman. "But you'll never hear her say, 'Oh, it doesn't 
bother me at all that he leaves his dirty socks around.' " 
</P>
<P>
One 34-year-old woman, who has been with the same man for three years, was 
driven to distraction by his tardiness. A prompt person by nature, she could 
not comprehend his consistent disregard for the clock. So she stopped trying. 
In her mind, she decided that he was reliable in every other way -- 
considerate, committed, intelligent -- and she realized that if she wanted to 
maintain the relationship (and her sanity) she would have to resolve this 
without him. She simply stopped waiting for him. 
</P>
<P>
Now when they go on vacations, she tells him the flight is an hour earlier than 
the scheduled departure time. When they go to the theater, she gives him his 
ticket and meets him there (he always misses the first act). And when he's late 
to pick her up at her apartment, she simply leaves. 
</P>
<P>
"She unhooked," says Olivia Mellan, another Washington couples therapist. "She 
did a very healthy thing by unhooking. But there is a sadness here because they 
didn't try to meet in the middle. The ideal is not to change each other but to 
try to move toward the middle." 
</P>
<P>
A happily married man of 17 years refers to the middle ground as a coming to 
terms with the three C's: change, compromise and compartmentalization. 
</P>
<P>
If two people know they are in for the long haul, they are apt to move closer 
toward the center. What they can't change or reach agreement on, they simply 
won't. They'll each do their own thing -- or compartmentalize. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the outgoing Washington editor in her late 30s and her self-contained 
consultant boyfriend. She likes to party and play tennis. A dinner for 20 is 
her idea of a cozy gathering. He prefers reading fiction, discussing movies and 
driving to the country -- activities that generally require, at most, two 
participants. Anything over four is a mob to him. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was younger I definitely would have tried to mold my personality to his 
personality," she says. "I would have gotten heavily into fiction." 
</P>
<P>
Now, instead, she says they have happily compartmentalized some areas. "He can 
watch his movies on the VCR while I read nonfiction," she says. 
</P>
<P>
And compromised. "I've come to enjoy weekends in the country, and sometimes we 
stay in town and go out," she says. "It works. We bring our own interests into 
the relationship . . . We're more accepting." 
</P>
<P>
And there are obsessives with similarly narrow views who do find room for 
acceptance and negotiation if everything else seems right. Take the doctor and 
the businesswoman. 
</P>
<P>
He is slight, eats yogurt and rides his exercise bike every day. Food is her 
friend and sweat is not in her vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
The minute they met while vacationing in Mexico he was compelled to comment on 
her weight -- which, it should be noted, is quite average. "Guess you decided 
not to lose the 10 pounds everyone else loses for vacation," he quipped as they 
ogled each other on a beach in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
His preoccupation with her waist continued through their initial rendezvous, 
picked up during the subsequent long-distance courtship and intensified during 
their engagement. He always brought it up in a lighthearted manner, and it was 
even a subject of a few jokes at the rehearsal dinner. 
</P>
<P>
She never thought it was funny, but she waited until after the wedding and 
finally exploded. 
</P>
<P>
"I had had it," she says. "I told him he was superficial and shallow. He told 
me I didn't care about myself. But when we talked about it, I discovered that 
it had to do with an obesity problem in his family -- not me. He was petrified 
I was going to become fat. 
</P>
<P>
"So I just said, 'Look, this is my natural weight. You just have to accept it. 
I'm not going to become a closet eater.' " 
</P>
<P>
After two years of marriage, they both have changed: She makes an effort to 
watch what she eats, and is careful to stay within a few pounds of her ideal 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
And compromised: He still comments on her weight but now only raises the point 
by saying how "perfect" her body is and how "much more perfect" it could be. 
</P>
<P>
And compartmentalized: He exercises without her. 
</P>
<P>
He was an advertising executive earning six figures, but dreamed of helping the 
underprivileged. She was finishing law school at an expensive university, and 
was anxious to secure their future. 
</P>
<P>
A few months into their marriage, he told her he was going to quit his job and 
become an inner-city social worker. She told him she didn't marry an inner-city 
social worker, and besides, who will pay the mortgage now? 
</P>
<P>
To say they had different notions about money is an understatement. They sought 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"Money," says Olivia Mellan, is "never about just money. It symbolizes other 
things: love, power, security, control, self-worth, freedom and dependency . . 
. If an individual has belief in any of the money myths, it's very difficult to 
reach agreement unless you discard your myths." 
</P>
<P>
The executive, as it turned out, was what Mellan calls a money-avoider and a 
dreamer. The law student was a worrier and a money amasser. In the end, the 
couple determined what their needs were. He really wanted change and a chance 
to give his life new meaning. She wanted security. 
</P>
<P>
They struck a compromise: They moved to a new city for change, where he 
continued to work as an executive but also took courses in social work while 
she finished her last two years of law school. Upon her graduation, he found a 
job teaching inner-city kids and she joined a high-powered law firm. 
</P>
<P>
Mellan says many couples are not as fortunate in resolving deep-seated money 
differences efficiently. She cites some of the most common money conflicts in 
relationships: 
</P>
<P>
Hoarders and Spenders: She puts every dime in a special bank and counts her 
change regularly. He visits the money machine daily. 
</P>
<P>
Mergers and Separators: He sees the benefits of pooling resources and operating 
as a unit; she tends to feel more secure keeping her checking account in her 
own name. 
</P>
<P>
Monks and Amassers: He (or she) marched in '68, and still thinks money is 
corrupt and Ralph Nader pays well; she (or he) graduated from Harvard Business 
School and accepted the highest-paying job upon graduation. 
</P>
<P>
Avoiders and Worriers. He has never seen the power bill; she balances her 
checkbook every day. 
</P>
<P>
"The trouble always comes when each person polarizes into the opposite 
extreme," says Mellan. "So what I advise my clients to do is practice the 
non-habitual. If they spend, I tell them to try saving. If they dream, I tell 
them to think practically. By putting themselves in the other person's shoes, 
there usually is a middle ground." 
</P>
<P>
"The idea," says Zimmerman, "is to constantly recall your original love 
feelings, and the belief back then that you would always work everything out. 
And then, hopefully, you will again." 
</P>
<P>
Amazingly enough, there's something about Christmas trees that creates a call 
to arms among new couples -- how to decorate them, what kind to get. 
</P>
<P>
It's the ritual, not the tree, says Zimmerman, and it's all "part of powerful 
feelings from childhood, your vision of how things should be . . . I've had 
couples where one person believed you just couldn't have Thanksgiving without a 
certain kind of sweet potatoes. Basically, you're giving up your youth to share 
your holiday with a stranger." 
</P>
<P>
Again, as one gets older, couples say that maintaining the traditions of their 
youth becomes less consuming. "It took about two minutes to decide we could 
have both a crucifix and a Star of David in the house," says a male Catholic 
banker married to a Jewish real-estate developer. 
</P>
<P>
"If I want to go to Mass, I go to Mass. If she wants to go to temple, she goes 
to temple. We won't let it become larger than life." 
</P>
<P>
Another newlywed couple found themselves at odds over how to decorate their 
first holiday tree. His family always used tinsel and hers preferred imported, 
delicate things. They ultimately scrapped both styles and invested in some new 
glass bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
"We developed our own tree, our own tradition," she says. 
</P>
<P>
But sadly, even when some think they're committed and ready to compromise, they 
soon discover that no matter how hard they try, the timing is off, the partner 
is wrong and the tree is fake. 
</P>
<P>
The retail executive and the television anchor had been dating nearly a year 
when the battle of the trees occurred. A few weeks before Christmas, he invited 
her out to buy a Scotch pine. She said she already had an artificial tree in 
the basement. 
</P>
<P>
He said, "That's not Christmas. We have to get a real tree." 
</P>
<P>
She said, "But it's so much work." 
</P>
<P>
"The tree represented romance to me," he said, "going out in the snow and 
picking out a big tree, being a family unit. I could just picture our kids 
carrying it back with us." 
</P>
<P>
She tried to change. But a few days after they put up the tree, she complained 
that the smell was making her sneeze. "And that she had to vacuum the needles 
off of her carpet was just too much for her," he says. 
</P>
<P>
She told him, "Never again." They broke up four months later.

To Janis and Harry Kerker: You are right on in your choices and your judgment. 
</P>
<P>
It seems inane to me for a couple to have children, then farm them out to be 
nurtured by (1) a person who sometimes does not speak the family language, (2) 
a person with a below-standard education, (3) a person who does not possess the 
family's goals, objectives and approach to life. 
</P>
<P>
I could say a lot on the subject of raising children -- because my three are 
grown college graduates. My life was one of marriage, divorce, single head of 
household raising children -- the whole nine yards, but it has been done.

Thanks for reminding your readers that though we're a minority, "stay-at-home 
moms" do still exist. But rather than call us "rare" and "vanishing," please 
substitute the words "endangered species." Vanishing means we're on our way 
out, but endangered means we could use a little protection. The media can start 
by resisting using the words "stay-at-home," "quaintly anachronistic," "an 
anomaly" or "a fantasy" to describe a full-time homemaker mom of the '90s.

MISS MANNERS: TACT IS REQUIRED FOR HOLIDAY FAMILY GATHERINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes it seems to Miss Manners as if all that old-fashioned families worry 
about at holiday time is how to avoid seeing one another. New-style families 
worry about how to get to see everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps this is not clear. Miss Manners will try again. 
</P>
<P>
Let us say we have a conventional, or what used to be conventional, 
three-generation family. Christmas dinner has always been at the grandparents' 
house, with all the grown-up children and grandchildren of different ages 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
What do these people want to know from Miss Manners at this time of year? How 
best to please their relatives? How to share the burden of entertaining while 
according the elders their proper authority? How to delight the children while 
instructing them in the spiritual nature of the holiday? 
</P>
<P>
No. They want to know how they can get out of going. They want to be with their 
friends. They are tired of hearing the same questions and comments about the 
way they live. It's too much trouble to get there. They can get better food at 
a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
But let us say that we have a family in which grandmother has cashiered 
grandfather for someone else, and grandfather is being amply consoled 
elsewhere. In the middle generation are not only the children and their current 
spouses, but a few former spouses who have kept up the attachment or who must 
be invited with their children, and assorted, ah, spouse equivalents, some with 
their own children. 
</P>
<P>
The youngest have been dividing their time all year between rival parental 
households, without managing to get to the splintered households of the other 
relatives, whom they now hardly know. In addition to all the other problems, 
the families have scattered geographically. 
</P>
<P>
Do these people share that yearning to have Christmas dinner by themselves, or 
in compatible subgroups, or in a restaurant, or with people to whom they are 
not related? 
</P>
<P>
Oh, no. They cherish the notion of a big traditional family gathering, with all 
the trimmings and everyone present -- except, of course, the particular former 
relative or prospective relative whom they want everyone to leave out in the 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
Granny doesn't want anyone to go to Grandpa's. Papa doesn't want anyone to go 
to Mama's. And everybody has called for barring at least one child's or 
parent's current love interest. But otherwise, each wants an all-inclusive 
family holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who want to keep the peace appropriate to the season, there has 
therefore grown up the custom of having multiple celebrations. Instead of going 
caroling from house to house, those who are on good terms with everyone go 
feasting from house to house. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Papa and his wife give Christmas Eve dinner, and Mama and her husband 
give Christmas Day dinner. Or perhaps they have both decided that Christmas Day 
is the only proper day to celebrate, so Mama gives a midday meal and Papa the 
evening meal. Of course both give presents, and both may lead the same rituals, 
such as tree-trimming. 
</P>
<P>
This makes things hard on the double-duty relatives. Children who have no 
trouble expressing delight at one round of festivities find themselves strained 
at the second. There is such a phenomenon as too much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Manners suggests a Christmas truce. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas is not the time to start barring relatives' attachments, whether they 
are romantic partners or stepchildren. The answer to "If she comes I won't" is, 
except in extreme cases, "I hope you'll change your mind, because we would miss 
you very much." 
</P>
<P>
In irrevocably split families, there has to be some understanding about 
dividing holiday rituals. Making the same people repeat rituals, other than 
kisses and present exchanging, is using the holiday for a weapon, not a 
celebration. And requiring anyone to eat two traditional Christmas meals is 
dangerous cruelty. 
</P>
<P>
Alternating holiday dinners, say with one person doing Thanksgiving and the 
other Christmas, is one way; celebrating Twelfth Night as the second round is 
another. If the households are near each other, a Christmas call on the one 
that is not serving Christmas dinner should be made. 
</P>
<P>
Such lessons in tact should not be lost on those who only have one such 
celebration to get through. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- Cousin Maurice and his wife, Lulu, sent invitations to the 
family to celebrate "Dutch treat" the 50th anniversary of Aunt Cornelia and 
Uncle Zachary at a local restaurant. At the affair, Cousin Maurice provided a 
cake and paid the tip, while each guest paid for his or her own meal. 
</P>
<P>
A few days after the party, the guests received thank-you notes from aunt and 
uncle with the postscript, "We are sorry for the misunderstanding" and a check 
for $15 per person. 
</P>
<P>
As we have never encountered such a situation before, we would appreciate your 
comments on the terms of the invitation and the subsequent reimbursement by 
aunt and uncle. The names have been changed to protect the parties involved. 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Miss Manners was so disappointed when she got to the end of 
your story and found that these were not real names, that she can hardly bear 
to answer your question. However, one must bear disappointments bravely. 
</P>
<P>
Aunt Cornelia and Uncle Zachary, being well-bred people, were properly 
horrified to hear of guests being charged to go to a party, and have chosen the 
least awkward way they can imagine to erase such a blight from their 
anniversary celebration. Miss Manners congratulates them on their taste, as 
well as their anniversary.

Sixty years of tobacco. That's how Henry Miller describes his life. His hands, 
wrinkled and stained from working the fields, have known nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a tobacco farmer," Miller said, nodding his head for emphasis. "My 
family's been growing tobacco for 150 years." But after generations of 
harvesting almost 70 acres of the sweet, heavy-scented crop, Miller didn't 
plant a single acre this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all over now," he said softly. "The Millers won't be growing tobacco 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Like hundreds of other Southern Maryland farmers, Miller has given up a 
350-year-old Maryland tradition. Caught between faltering demand for cigarettes 
and the scarcity of labor needed to work the fields, the farmers have stopped 
growing tobacco -- once considered the backbone of the state. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike many who were defeated, Miller is trying to hold onto his farm, 
which locals say was one of the biggest tobacco operations in the state. 
</P>
<P>
This year, he replaced his tobacco crop with vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
"People have to eat, but they don't have to smoke," Miller reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
Only 8,500 acres of tobacco were planted in Southern Maryland in 1989, 
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Just seven years ago, more 
than 24,000 acres were devoted to the crop. While thousands of acres have been 
sold to developers, there are still many farmers, like Miller, who are trying 
to make the switch to other commodities. 
</P>
<P>
To help ease the transition, Maryland officials have converted the little-used 
state tobacco warehouse in Cheltenhem, near Waldorf, into a retail and 
wholesale produce market that gives the former tobacco farmers an outlet for 
their new crops. 
</P>
<P>
Since opening on July 3, the Southern Maryland Regional Farmers Market has 
swarmed with customers eager for squash, green beans and tomatoes. Virtually 
all of the 28 farmers who operate the produce stands are former tobacco 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Eileen Shlagel, one of the produce vendors, said the market will provide a 
desperately needed source of income. "Tobacco was the cash crop in Maryland," 
she said. "Without it, it's going to be hard to survive." Shlagel and her 
husband, Russell, plant more than 200 acres on a farm near Waldorf in Charles 
County. The farm has been in the family for more than 100 years, and until last 
year, tobacco was always part of the harvest. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd go back to tobacco if I could," Russell Shlagel said. "When you do 
something like that for such a long time, it's hard to make the switch. But 
we're going to try." 
</P>
<P>
The Shlagels' farm, once surrounded by other fields and greenery, now is 
bordered by subdivisions. The encroaching development has made life even more 
difficult, Russell Shlagel said. "I have to plan my manure spreading around the 
neighbors' weekend cookouts," he said. "Otherwise, we get lots of complaints. 
That's no way to run a farm." 
</P>
<P>
George B. Roche, marketing specialist with the Maryland Department of 
Agriculture, said houses are replacing tobacco farms at a rapid rate. "Houses 
are the No. 1 crop in Southern Maryland," he said. "With all of the developers 
out there offering such high prices for the land, it's no wonder more farmers 
haven't sold out." In 1982, there were about 2,400 farms in Prince George's, 
Anne Arundel, St. Mary's, Charles and Calvert counties, which traditionally 
make up Southern Maryland's tobacco belt. By 1987, that number had dropped more 
than 50%, to 1,300 farms, according to the U.S. Agriculture Census. Roche and 
other agriculture experts estimate that another 200 farms have been sold in the 
past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Hodge, executive director of the Tri-County Council, a government group 
that represents St. Mary's, Charles and Calvert counties, said he hopes the 
produce market will keep more farmers from selling their land, thereby halting 
the rapid growth of residential and commercial development in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't just a problem for the farmer," Hodge said. "Everybody's 
complaining about overdevelopment. Unless we convince the farmers to stick 
around, we won't be able to control the growth." 
</P>
<P>
Hodge is quick to point out that tobacco still is Maryland's third largest 
crop, accounting for auction sales of $18 million this year and as much as $57 
million as recently as five years ago. But the 11.7 million pounds of tobacco 
that were sold in April still are a drop in the bucket when compared with 
national production levels. 
</P>
<P>
"In North Carolina auctions, that much tobacco can be sold in one day," Hodge 
said. Last year, the United States produced more than 2 billion pounds of 
tobacco, according to the USDA. Although flu-cured and burley tobaccos account 
for almost all of the nation's production, Maryland tobacco, known in the 
industry as Type 32, holds a special niche in the marketplace. Maryland's 
unique variety is valued because of its ability to hold a flame, and it has 
been particularly popular in Europe, where unfiltered cigarettes are common. 
</P>
<P>
Many packs of European cigarettes make a point to advertise that they contain 
Maryland-grown tobacco. Luxembourg even has a cigarette brand called Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people don't realize what a specialty Maryland tobacco is," said Peter 
Wilby, international marketing specialist with the state Department of 
Agriculture. "The state of Maryland was formed by the British to grow tobacco. 
Maryland tobacco was king." 
</P>
<P>
But as health concerns about the effects of tobacco have grown, tobacco use has 
fallen. And as farmers find other crops and farms give way to suburban 
development, the age-old way of life in Southern Maryland is slowly and, most 
say, inevitably coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, much of the state's crop each year is purchased by Swiss 
cigarette manufacturers, although Type 32 tobacco also is used in small 
portions in some American cigarettes. While export demand for cigarettes is 
growing, domestic consumption continues to fall. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. cigarette production is expected to decline 2% to 3% from last year, said 
Bob Miller, a tobacco specialist with the USDA. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Europeans are smoking fewer cigarettes than ever before, 
Wilby said. "The Europeans liked to smoke a heavier cigarette, which got its 
flavor from the Maryland leaf. But they're changing to a milder blend, and 
they're smoking less and less," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilby estimates that exports account for only 25% of Maryland tobacco sales, 
compared with 50% just 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the continued drop in demand, the Maryland Department of Agriculture 
is sponsoring trade missions to Asia, where cigarette consumption is on the 
rise. This year, South Korea purchased about 300,000 pounds of Maryland 
tobacco, a first-ever sale for the state. 
</P>
<P>
Wilby and others insist that if Maryland tobacco is to survive another decade, 
new markets must be found. But this year, only $7,500 was appropriated for 
marketing overseas, Hodge said. "We can't do much with $7,500," he said. "But 
you can't blame the state for not giving us more, given the market conditions." 
</P>
<P>
The farmers say it's only a matter of time before tobacco disappears from the 
fields. "I think its time is over," said Mary Stacsh, who owns more than 400 
acres on three farms but stopped growing tobacco this year. "For one thing, we 
won't have any land to raise it on. And with all the talk about smoking, how 
can we survive?" Agricultural experts, however, aren't as quick to dismiss the 
future of tobacco in the area. "I think we've leveled off," Roche said. "No, 
there won't be any more 60-acre growers. But people will keep planting a few 
acres each year. There will always be a demand for what Maryland has to offer." 
</P>
<P>
Farmers agree that the demand, though reduced, probably will continue. Still, 
they say they can't afford the labor to raise the crop. 
</P>
<P>
Tobacco farmers have resisted mechanization more than any other crop grown in 
the area, Roche said. The seeds are hand-planted in carefully protected beds 
late in the winter, and transplanted to the fields in the spring. In the 
summer, the flower buds must be removed by hand. 
</P>
<P>
In the late summer and fall, the plants must be cut down by hand and strung up 
in barns to cure and dry. After several weeks, the leaves must be stripped off 
the plants, graded and bundled, all by hand. The entire process takes about 14 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The USDA estimates that growing and harvesting an acre of tobacco takes an 
average of 230 worker-hours, compared with two to three worker-hours for one 
acre of corn. On the other hand, an acre of good tobacco can be worth $3,000 at 
auction, while an acre's worth of corn may have a market value of less than 
$300. 
</P>
<P>
Stacsh said she couldn't find enough labor to harvest her crop. "It's dirty, 
sweaty work," she said. "When they can work in McDonald's, where it's 
air-conditioned, and make the same money, why would anyone want to bother 
working tobacco?" 
</P>
<P>
So like the other farmers, Stacsh has stopped planting her traditional 40 acres 
of tobacco. She's also sold about 100 acres of her land to developers. 
</P>
<P>
David Martin, agricultural extension agent for Anne Arundel County, said the 
recent tobacco auction proved that there's more than demand at work on the 
market. In April, Maryland tobacco farmers enjoyed one of their best auction 
seasons in nearly a decade. Top-quality tobacco sold for about $1.60 per pound, 
close to the most recent peak years of 1981 and 1982. Despite the high prices, 
tobacco acreage continued to decline. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't stop this process now, the whole support industry is going to go 
under," Roche said. "It reminds me of the strawberry production on the Eastern 
Shore. In the 1920s, the shore had the world's biggest production of 
strawberries. You'd never know that now." 
</P>
<P>
Roche is working furiously to see that the produce market succeeds, for in it 
he sees the future of the tobacco farmers. "The writing's on the wall," he 
said. "It's been there for 20 years. We're got to get these farmers to 
diversify." 
</P>
<P>
Billy Hatfield of Huntingtown appreciates the effort. "I don't want to dump my 
land. I'm a farmer. That's all I know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield has replaced his 60 acres of tobacco with produce and corn. He sold 
cucumbers and summer squash at the wholesale market last week. "This is going 
to help us a lot," he said. "I've never sold wholesale before, but I guess I'll 
get used to it."

PARTNERSHIP WITH DEVELOPER TO NET DOWNEY SCHOOLS $10 MILLION 
</P>

<P>
The Downey Unified School District has entered into an agreement with a 
development company that plans to build and sell single-family homes on the 
11.3-acre site of a closed elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Education voted in September to sell the property to M. J. Brock 
&amp; Sons Inc. for $9.1 million, Supt. Edward A. Sussman said. The company 
also offered to give the district 35% of its profit from the home sales, which 
would be about $1 million. The district's total income would be about $10.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The old Edith Unsworth Elementary School, 9001 Lindsey Ave., which was closed 
in 1972, will be demolished, Sussman said. The sale will not be final, however, 
until Downey city officials approve the plans for the homes. 
</P>
<P>
The development company expects to submit a formal proposal to the city at the 
beginning of the year, said Les Thomas, the Orange County division manager for 
M. J. Brock, headquartered in Los Angeles. "We have entered a limited 
partnership with the school district to develop and sell single-family homes to 
earn profits," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
He said his company obtained the property through a sealed bid submitted in 
September. If everything goes as planned, construction will begin sometime next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
If the city does not approve the new homes, the school district is guaranteed 
the $9.1-million price for the property, Sussman said. 
</P>
<P>
But, Sussman said he is confident that the city will grant approval, because 
the property is zoned for R1-5000 single-family homes -- one house per 5,000 
square feet -- and the company's preliminary presentation was for single-family 
home construction. 
</P>
<P>
"A joint venture between a school district and a developer is a new concept 
that school districts have been involved in the last five years," said Eric 
Bathen, legal counsel for the district for 10 years. Although the 65-35 split 
of the profit is common, he said the ratio can vary. 
</P>
<P>
Bathen has arranged a similar deal between a developer and the Fountain Valley 
Elementary School District, and has heard of more arrangements of this type in 
Huntington Beach and Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Such deals are becoming more attractive, he said, because they have tremendous 
profit potential. "They work well because they benefit both parties," Bathen 
said. "The developer acts as the general partner and manager of the property 
and shares the profits with the school district." 
</P>
<P>
Sussman also said that these contracts are common and that districts enter into 
these agreements to gain credibility in dealing with the public, plus a share 
in the profit. 
</P>
<P>
He said that $5 million of the sale price would be used to refurbish four 
buildings at Downey High School, and the rest of the money would be used to 
renovate other schools in the district. "The buildings at Downey High School 
are more than 30 years old and in dire need of repair," Sussman said. "There 
has not been any major work done on the school since 1939." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the need, Sussman said that construction would begin on the high 
school first. The plans for renovation are complete, and work should begin in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1988, voters rejected a bond issue to generate $11.4 million to 
renovate school sites in the Downey Unified School District, Sussman said. 
</P>
<P>
The district then applied for other state bonds, he said, but found that there 
was no money available at the time. He said that even though the district 
qualified for funding, it would have to wait several years. 
</P>
<P>
The Downey board voted this year to sell one of its three vacant schools. He 
said Unsworth was chosen because there are not many students in the northeast 
section of Downey where the school is located, and no major growth is 
anticipated. Sussman said Unsworth would not be one of the schools reopened if 
overcrowding ever became a problem in the district. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Supt. Donna Boose said that Unsworth was the first elementary school in 
Downey to be closed due to a decline in student enrollment. She was principal 
of Unsworth when the district voted to close the school after enrollment fell 
to 400, with projections of further decline.

JUDGE'S RULING LEAVES HOLLYWOOD GROUP FACING UNCERTAIN FUTURE; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: ADVISORY COMMITTEE DEFIED CITY'S ORDER TO DISBAND. INSTEAD, IT 
FILED SUIT AGAINST THE COUNCIL. COURT RULING LEAVES RENEGADE GROUP WITHOUT 
LEGAL STANDING OR CITY FUNDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of a citizens advisory committee on Hollywood redevelopment, losers in 
a court battle last week with the city of Los Angeles, have called an emergency 
meeting Monday to decide whether to disband or continue fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The scrappy group of redevelopment critics has been meeting without the 
blessing of the City Council or the Community Redevelopment Agency. The city 
has shunned the committee since May, when the council named a new advisory 
panel to replace it, but 14 of the abolished committee's 25 members have 
refused to quit. 
</P>
<P>
The renegade group, known as the Project Area Committee, sued the city in June 
in hopes of overturning the council action, but a Superior Court judge sided 
with the city on Wednesday. The ruling has left the committee with no legal 
standing and no city funding. 
</P>
<P>
The committee has been covering its expenses -- about $300 a month -- by 
passing a hat at its meetings and getting friends and family to chip in. The 
lawsuit had sought reimbursement from the redevelopment agency as well as 
funding for an annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointed committee members called Monday's meeting after Chairman Robert 
Nudelman telephoned them with news of the ruling. Nudelman said the group is 
confused and saddened. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know exactly what we will do," Nudelman said. "We have to deal with 
the issue of how the (committee) would function. We enter a gray area once we 
approach the first of the year because elections have to be held." 
</P>
<P>
Under redevelopment law, the committee would have been required to hold an 
election before the end of this month for 11 of its seats. The committee had 
put off the election in hopes of winning the lawsuit and getting funding from 
the redevelopment agency, which paid $12,000 for a similar election last 
December when the group was still authorized by the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have that big of a hat to pass," Nudelman said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the city refuses to recognize it, the committee has attempted to 
maintain its legitimacy by conducting meetings according to redevelopment law. 
The committee sends press releases, posts agendas, votes on proposed projects 
and continues to set aside time at its meetings for reports from the 
redevelopment agency, which now presents the reports to the other advisory 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
The committee was created in December, 1983, to help the redevelopment agency 
draft a renewal plan for central Hollywood. When the council adopted the 
$922-million plan in May, 1986, the committee became an advisory group required 
by state law to report to the agency on "policy matters" affecting local 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the Project Area Committee and the city revolves around one 
question: How long is the city and its redevelopment agency required to consult 
with the committee on redevelopment matters? 
</P>
<P>
The debate whittles down to differing interpretations of a single sentence in 
the 57-page redevelopment plan: "To the maximum extent permitted by law, the 
activities of the agency pertaining to implementation of this redevelopment 
plan including formulation of work programs shall be developed in consultation 
with the Project Area Committee." 
</P>
<P>
Committee members argue that the sentence means the redevelopment agency must 
work with the group throughout the plan's 30-year life. The city, however, 
contends the sentence falls within the limits of state redevelopment law, which 
only requires the redevelopment agency to consult with the committee for three 
years after adoption of the plan -- a period that elapsed in May. 
</P>
<P>
In a seven-paragraph written ruling, Judge Kurt J. Lewin said the sentence is 
too vague to be interpreted as a 30-year lease-on-life for the Project Area 
Committee. He said the council could have made such a provision, but did not. 
"The evidence taken as a whole . . . demonstrates that the adoption of the plan 
would in all likelihood have foundered had such clear and unambiguous provision 
been advanced," the judge wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Lewin also questioned whether such a provision would have been legal. He said 
it "would extinguish the council's discretion for years to come, 
notwithstanding that the need for (the committee) might diminish and become an 
unwarranted expense." 
</P>
<P>
Committee members said last week that the judge's ruling deprives residents of 
the 1,100-acre redevelopment area of elected representatives. They contend that 
Hollywood-area Councilman Michael Woo, a strong proponent of redevelopment, 
persuaded the City Council to abolish the group because redevelopment critics 
had gained control of it through the election last December. 
</P>
<P>
"We were voted in by the people of this community, and they deserve our 
representation," said committee member Chris Shabel, who won a two-year term 
last December. 
</P>
<P>
Woo has said that he abolished the committee because it had become a forum for 
"wacky behavior" that was determined to derail the redevelopment effort. The 
new advisory panel, known as the Hollywood Community Advisory Council, consists 
entirely of Woo's appointees, who he says share his vision for Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the legal issues, the decision to appeal last week's ruling may 
come down to a question of finances. The Santa Monica law firm of Wallin, 
Kress, Reisman, Price &amp; Dilkes has represented the Project Area Committee 
free of charge, but the firm was banking on winning the lawsuit and being 
reimbursed by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Stanton J. Price said after Wednesday's ruling that the firm is "not 
going to abandon the group," but some committee members wonder how long the 
firm can afford to stick with them. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of this will depend on the attorney," Shabel said. "He is doing this 
without any money. It is something that is time consuming and lengthy. I have 
my fingers crossed that he is going to say let's proceed forward." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The 1.7-square-mile redevelopment project covers the core of Hollywood, an area 
of 35,000 residents that encompasses Mann's Chinese Theater, the Sunset-Gower 
Studios and many of the film capital's most historic buildings. Its Project 
Area Committee, a citizens advisory group created under state law, has not 
always been regarded as a haven for redevelopment foes. A group of Hollywood 
residents has sued the city, claiming the committee was unfairly stacked in its 
early years with big business interests looking to make a profit off the 
renewal effort.

HUNGARIAN TEACHERS LEARN ENGLISH BY TEACHING IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA KOH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The subject was fractional equations, the course, Academically Enriched Algebra 
II. 
</P>
<P>
The teacher scribbled on the blackboard, leading the class through examples. 
Some students called out answers and questions, others whispered to each other 
or played with watches and pencils. A couple, apparently having given up, 
rested their heads on their desks. 
</P>
<P>
It was a typical American classroom, in other words, except for one thing: The 
teacher, Adrienn Orosz, was Hungarian. 
</P>
<P>
Orosz and 10 compatriots who have been teaching and learning in Westside high 
schools since September are part of the vanguard of their country's rush to 
learn English. They have spent mornings teaching and observing at Santa Monica 
and University high schools. In the afternoons, they have taken graduate 
education, math and science courses at UCLA. After they return to Hungary at 
the end of this week, they will teach math and science, in English, at 
Hungary's "dual-language" high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the pace of political and economic changes accelerated to a gallop 
in Hungary earlier this year, demand for English was high. Since then, it has 
skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the rise of English has been the demise of Russian. In September, 
the government abolished the requirement that every Hungarian student aged 11 
to 18 study Russian. Now that students can choose among Russian, English, 
German, French, Spanish and other languages, almost 80% of them opt for 
English, and "Russian is very much on the bottom," said Ferencne Gerencser, 
Hungarian coordinator of the guest-teaching program and head of the language 
department at Budapest's Eotvos Lorand University. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary, which for years has been the most Western-looking of the Eastern bloc 
countries, established its system of dual-language high schools three years 
ago. There are now 23 such schools in the country at which students are taught 
math, science, geography, history and other subjects in English, German, 
French, Italian, Russian or Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
The aim is to provide students with not just conversational proficiency in 
other languages but also to teach them the technical language they would need 
to study medicine, science and international affairs, Gerencser said. 
</P>
<P>
Given their population of just 10.6 million, Hungarians also realize that 
"nobody's going to learn Hungarian," added Russell Campbell, director of the 
UCLA Language Resource Program who is helping to coordinate the Hungarians' 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
But the English-language schools weren't prepared for the crushing demand. At 
one of the 10 dual-language schools specializing in English, nearly 2,000 
students applied for 72 openings, said Orosz, who teaches there. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian officials decided they needed more Hungarians qualified to teach 
subjects in English. UCLA language specialists, meanwhile, having heard about 
the dual-language schools from Hungarian educators visiting Los Angeles, wanted 
to learn more about the program. 
</P>
<P>
Out of this sprang the arrangement this fall for the Hungarian English-school 
teachers, most of whom had just finished five years of university math and 
science, to apprentice in U.S. schools. Meanwhile, two UCLA researchers have 
gone to Hungary to test the students and help develop curricula. Campbell and 
Gerencser hope to expand the project next year and start an exchange of high 
school students. 
</P>
<P>
For the first four weeks, the Hungarians observed the Westside high school math 
and science classes to become familiar with jargon and teaching styles. Their 
biggest worry was that they would not understand the students or be understood 
because of their accents. Students, however, adjusted quickly, and the American 
teachers found the Hungarians' command of English very good, said Don Checchi, 
University High School math department chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The "lack of discipline" in American classrooms was "a little bit disturbing," 
Gerencser said. The Hungarians learned to flash frowns and say, "Please pay 
attention to me" and "Please be quiet." 
</P>
<P>
American students are freer in their dress and behavior, the Hungarians noted. 
"They just stand up, go to sharpen their pencils, they change their seats in 
the classroom -- and I see it's natural for the teachers," Orosz said. There 
are no pencil sharpeners in Hungarian classrooms -- students bring their own -- 
but if there were, the students would have to ask permission first to leave 
their desks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Teaching methods in the two countries also differ, the Hungarians said. Ildiko 
Csok, with a camera and tape recorder, captured University High School 
chemistry teacher Kevin Paulsen lying on a bed of nails (to demonstrate 
pressure rules) and boiling water in a can, to have it collapse when put on ice 
(to demonstrate implosion). American teachers use more showmanship, she said. 
"One thing about teaching science -- you've got to use a lot of 
demonstrations," Paulsen said later. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the publicity about American children being science and math 
illiterates compared to the rest of the world, the Hungarians -- perhaps 
because they were teaching many college-prep courses -- found the students to 
be "very smart," said one of the visitors, Katalin Koszta. "These students are 
much more interested. . . . They ask (questions) immediately from you." 
</P>
<P>
The American teachers were likewise impressed with the Hungarian teachers' 
intelligence. "Their educational background is superb," University High math 
teacher Lori McNeal said. "They never have to think about their math, and they 
don't even have to hesitate that much on their English." 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarians also got high grades from the students. Csok, who is quiet, and 
the fast-talking McNeal are "like night and day," but junior Sarah Morris said 
she admired Csok for "having the guts to do this. . . . Just the fact that she 
came from Hungary and can teach math in English is admirable." 
</P>
<P>
Shana Rutberg, 15, who said she learned about the geometry of bonding molecules 
from Csok, said she admired the Hungarian students who have to learn chemistry 
in English. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers and a few students picked the Hungarians' brains on not only math and 
science but on political developments and life in Hungary as well. They pointed 
to the Hungarians newspaper articles on the breathtaking moves, including the 
country's change from "the Communist People's Republic of Hungary" to an 
independent republic and the first free voting since 1945. "(The timing is) 
exciting. While they were here, (Hungary) became the Republic of Hungary, in 
one day," marveled physics teacher Jay Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Most unbelievable for the American teachers were the Hungarians' salaries -- 
about $100 to $180 per month, while rent in Budapest can range from $65 to 
almost $200, Gerencser said. Teachers end up living with their parents, sharing 
apartments, taking second jobs or leaving the profession for computer science 
or other jobs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But the low pay rates plague other workers too, she said, because the socialist 
economy, saddled with inflation and austerity measures, "is very much run 
down." The visiting Hungarians followed the October Beverly Hills teachers 
strike with interest, Gerencser said, adding that Hungary has not had a teacher 
strike in modern times. 
</P>
<P>
Before their departure on Friday, the visitors will take a final test at UCLA 
to determine "how much we've improved," Orosz said. One of the areas of 
greatest improvement, she said, is undoubtedly in the specialized vocabulary of 
teaching. Terms such as "flip it over" (inverting the numerator and denominator 
of a fraction), "simplify a fraction" and "reduce to lowest terms" are "all new 
expressions that I can't learn from a dictionary" but that are necessary for 
teaching in English, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other American idioms, such as "it's a piece of cake," now roll off their 
tongues, Orosz said. "And (for) the morning, we knew, 'you are not very fresh,' 
(but in America), we learned, 'you are not bright-eyed and bushy-tailed' -- 
which we like very much," she said, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there are terms that won't be found in any book, Hungarian or American. 
Chemistry teacher Paulsen said that when he sketches atoms, after following all 
the technical rules for drawing their bonds and parts, he declares them "happy 
atoms." He recalled he was sitting in the back of the room one day while a 
Hungarian teacher was at the blackboard, only to hear her proclaim, "It's a 
happy atom!" 
</P>
<P>
"There are going to be happy Hungarian atoms when (the teachers) get back to 
Budapest," he said.

in Westside high schools since September are part of the vanguard of their 
country's rush to learn English. They have spent mornings teaching and 
observing at Santa Monica and University high schools. In the afternoons, they 
have taken graduate education, math and science courses at UCLA. After they 
return to Hungary at the end of this week, they will teach math and science, in 
English, at Hungary's "dual-language" high schools. The Hungarians -- perhaps 
because they were teaching many college-prep courses -- found American students 
to be very sharp. "These students are much more interested," Koszta said. "They 
ask (questions) immediately from you." CASSY COHEN / Los Angeles Times

STRETCH FOR SAFETY;

<P>
FITNESS: SANTA MONICA TESTS A MANDATORY EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR CITY WORKERS. IT 
HOPES TO REDUCE ON-THE-JOB INJURIES AND WORKERS' COMPENSATION COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
David Williams and his co-workers scrunched their necks, heads lolling from one 
side to the other. They weren't in an aerobics studio, but rather in a grimy 
Santa Monica city repair facility. 
</P>
<P>
Before getting down to work each day, the men, in regular work clothes, 
exercise as part of a one-year test program of mandatory exercise to see 
whether the city can prevent many work-related injuries and reduce the amount 
of money it must pay for workers' compensation. 
</P>
<P>
"You feel a little more limber," said Williams, one of at least 60 city 
employees who have been taught how to lead co-workers in exercises since the 
program began three months ago. "I don't want to be 65 years old and have my 
chest near my knees because my hamstrings are too tight." 
</P>
<P>
While private U.S. companies have followed the Japanese in requiring employees 
to exercise, Santa Monica is one of the first employers in the public sector to 
make the practice mandatory. The city spent about $14,000 for training, 
stretching videos, newsletters and occasional checkups from Athletes in 
Industry, the injury-prevention company it hired. 
</P>
<P>
City Risk Manager Tom Phillips, whose office was created three years ago, said 
Santa Monica is focusing on prevention because on-the-job injuries, medical and 
insurance costs and the city's liability for injuries are all rising. The city 
is "permissibly uninsured," he said, which means that it pays for job-related 
injuries out of its own coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Except for those with doctors' excuses, the stretch routine is mandatory for 
the 580 employees in the General Services and Police departments, which make up 
40% of the city's work force but claim 60% of workers' compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Workers in these two departments, Phillips' office found, are more susceptible 
than others to preventable injuries, sprains and strains. From a cold start, 
after sitting in cars, police officers must be able to sprint after suspects. 
Mechanics have to wiggle 1,000-pound tires onto tractors. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like an athlete has to get their muscles warmed up . . . so must a person 
engaged in industry," Phillips said. "If the results are successful, I can see 
it expanded to other departments." 
</P>
<P>
For six to eight minutes at the start of each shift, workers reach for the sky, 
hands above their heads. They squat, stretch to each side and do a series of 
other stretches, holding each pose for about 10 seconds. Done regularly, the 12 
stretching exercises are expected to increase muscle flexibility. Early next 
year, Phillips plans to meet with exercise team leaders and evaluate the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Williams said, employees griped about the stretching and doubted that 
the program would work. Those who did stretch got wolf howls and teasing 
comments from workers in other departments. "We're out here like ballerinas 
doing this thing," said the 6-foot, 6-inch mechanic, raising his hands above 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
Some General Services workers are enthusiastic about the exercises. They say 
they like spending time together before splitting to different ends of the 
shop. They say the routine has raised morale and cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
But the reaction from police isn't so positive. One word written on an exercise 
poster in the roll-call room expresses some patrol officers' opinion of the 
program: STUPID. 
</P>
<P>
Officers complain that the 30 pounds of equipment on their belts prevents them 
from really stretching and bending. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the guys are apathetic about it. It's extremely impractical to do 
(considering)what we wear and the time we have to do it," said Officer Gary 
Herman, who has won medals for weightlifting in international competition. But 
even he acknowledges the importance of stretching, having torn leg muscles in a 
foot chase. 
</P>
<P>
Police also complain that if they rip their uniforms when they stretch, it's 
unlikely that the city will pay to replace or repair them. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, officers say they lose training time to the stretch routine. 
</P>
<P>
But some think it's worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"We have such a limited time for our squad meeting, which is usually 25 
minutes, it's hard to fit the program in," said patrol Lt. Al Bonar. "Maybe we 
give up a little training to have something like this, because if we don't, we 
lose officers to injury on duty." 
</P>
<P>
Herman said the program would work better if officers were paid to come in 
early for the mandatory routine and allowed to wear sweat suits. 
</P>
<P>
For fiscal year 1988-89, Santa Monica paid about $2 million in workers' 
compensation, $1.2 million of it to General Services and police. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said that figure reversed a trend of increasing compensation bills. In 
fiscal 1987-88, the city paid out about $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to workers' compensation, he said, the city pays about an equal 
amount each year in overtime and on hiring or training people to take over for 
the injured. 
</P>
<P>
The stretches do not take the body beyond normal office movements, Phillips 
said. He said seven employees have either claimed workers' compensation due to 
injury from stretches or notified his office that they may have suffered from 
the stretches. He attributed most of the complaints to resistance to change 
because five of them originated in the first month of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to motivate people to be safe," said Phillips, pointing out that 
few employees used the city's free, voluntary health program. "People are just 
preoccupied with doing other things: 'Got my job to do, my family to take care 
of, bills to pay.' 
</P>
<P>
"I think employee morale can go up in a program like this. If you feel good 
about the organization you work for, you can be a more productive employee."

MODEL TRAIN SHOP SALES ARE AT FULL STEAM; 
</P>
<P>
RAILROADS: CULVER CITY STORE SELLING NOSTALGIA OUT OF BUILDING THAT IS REPLICA 
OF L.A.'S UNION STATION. 
</P>

Allen Drucker likes the view through the wrong end of a telescope. 
</P>
<P>
Inside his shop, the displays seem to be right out of "Gulliver's Travels": a 
six-foot-long train winding through a Lilliputian landscape dotted with 
four-inch conifers, a 10-inch saloon, a foot-high bridge and six-inch men. 
</P>
<P>
But it's the outside of his shop he is especially proud of. The building that 
houses Allied Model Trains is a model of Los Angeles' Union Station, the last 
great railroad terminal built in the country. 
</P>
<P>
And Drucker says the sales have gone full steam since he moved his 43-year-old 
shop eight weeks ago to the new building on Sepulveda Boulevard in Culver City 
from its earlier location on Pico Boulevard near the Westside Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
"I really attribute it to the building," he said. "Everybody talks about the 
building. Even those who are not interested in model trains drop in to have a 
look." 
</P>
<P>
The unique architecture of the shop and the holiday season have together 
brought a stream of visitors: window-shopping pedestrians, children staring at 
the railroad cars chugging along the tracks and serious buffs such as Jerry 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
For Brown, 57, the shop is a nostalgic journey down memory lane. "I have been 
to Union Station many times. I watched them build it. Dad used to take me and 
my brother to the railroads. We waved at the engineer and he blew his horn. 
This shop has the same air about it. It's a perfect idea." 
</P>
<P>
Drucker, 41, said the idea of moving to a shop that resembled Union Station was 
a combination of accident and circumstance. "The large trains took a lot of 
space. The shop wasn't big enough. And with the advent of the Westside 
Pavilion, . . . customer parking became a problem." 
</P>
<P>
When his architect asked him to photograph buildings that could be used as 
references for the design of the new shop, Drucker said he found little that he 
liked at first. 
</P>
<P>
Then, "one day on the way home, I was driving on the freeway and saw the Union 
Station. I started taking pictures, and the very first drawing came out so well 
that I went ahead with it." 
</P>
<P>
The tower and the clock of Union Station have been scaled down to the exact 
proportion. But Drucker said it was impossible for him to be "completely 
faithful" to the original building. Union Station, built in 1939, is considered 
a classic synthesis of Spanish mission architecture and modern streamline 
design. 
</P>
<P>
The Allied shop lacks Union Station's marble floors and open interiors, but it 
does have a curved aluminum roof, overhanging arches and ornate lamps that 
Drucker says help re-create the station's feel. 
</P>
<P>
Drucker's new shop is five times the size of his previous one on Pico 
Boulevard. This is a great advantage, Drucker said, because of the rising 
popularity of larger trains and sprawling displays. 
</P>
<P>
Customers agree the shop effectively combines aesthetics with usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
"It is really one of the best of its kind," said Craig Schieve, 33, a hobbyist 
who has been to the shop four times since it opened. 
</P>
<P>
The shop, which Drucker said took $2.7 million to set up and stock, has 
sections catering to serious hobbyists, high-tech railroaders, railroad 
historians and collectors, as well as those who are just looking for a modest 
layout to set up under the Christmas tree. It has a small library stocked with 
railroad literature and a range of magazines devoted to different aspects of 
the hobby. 
</P>
<P>
It is an expensive hobby these days. Most of the high-quality model trains are 
imported from Europe, "where railroads are much more important in real life 
than in this country," Drucker said. A large layout with two West German LGB 
trains, tracks, a miniature amusement park with a Ferris wheel and model 
buildings, including a post office, a railway station and a saloon, can be 
worth $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
A smaller LGB set, ideal as a Christmas present for a beginner, costs just 
under $275. 
</P>
<P>
It is possible to buy a small set for as little as $100, but Drucker doesn't 
recommend it -- they are usually manufactured in the United States and are of 
poor quality, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Germans tend to take pride in this business. The American companies are 
bothered mainly about the bottom line and the profit margin. Hence, a lot of 
their stuff is junk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Drucker, who bought Allied Model Trains in 1975 from "an airline pilot who ran 
the store merely for tax purposes," said he thinks his new shop represents the 
"future of the model railroad industry." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only building specifically built for model trains," he said. "The 
earlier Mom-and-Pop stores are disappearing. What is needed is a well-stocked 
store -- and we have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Allied Model Trains is at 4411 Sepulveda Blvd., Culver City. The phone is 
(213) 313-9353.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deficit 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 272 to 128, the House approved a deficit reduction bill that puts 
the fiscal 1990 federal budget in compliance with Gramm-Rudman limits on annual 
indebtedness. The Senate then approved the measure by voice vote, and President 
Bush signed it into law. 
</P>
<P>
The "reconciliation" bill (HR 3299) would reduce red ink for the year that 
began Oct. 1 by at least $14.6 billion, lowering the deficit to the 
$110-billion level required by the Gramm-Rudman law. Legislated spending cuts 
would account for about $6.6 billion of the reduction and new taxes about $2.9 
billion. Forced across-the-board cuts, in effect until February under 
"sequestration" provisions, would reduce the year's deficit by $4.6 billion, 
and lower Treasury borrowing costs resulting from the bill would save $629 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Along with cutting the deficit and enacting new taxes in specialized areas of 
the economy, the bill makes several policy changes. For example, it reforms the 
way physicians are reimbursed under Medicare, prohibiting them from charging 
unreasonable fees that ultimately are paid by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The measure confronts the deficit more squarely than any of the annual 
reconciliation bills passed previously this decade. Still, it leaves 
entitlement programs virtually untouched, resorts to accounting gimmicks, such 
as moving the $1.8-billion Postal Service deficit and $420 million in Farm 
Credit System bailout costs "off budget," and once again pushes the most 
difficult fiscal and political decisions on taming the deficit into the next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey) said, "A yes vote provides for real 
deficit reduction." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Silvio O. Conte (R-Mass.) said the bill lacks "any significant effort 
to address the root cause of the deficit" entitlement programs. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the reconciliation bill.

proposed Nevada wilderness area. Congress later sent to President Bush a bill 
(S 974) designating 733,000 unspoiled acres in the state as federal wilderness

412,000 acres recommended by Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yuetter, who 
oversees the Forest Service.

Dial-a-Porn 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 98 to 306, the House refused to remove "dial-a-porn" language from 
the fiscal 1990 appropriations bill for the departments of Labor, Health and 
Human Services, andEducation (HR 3566). This preserved Senate language to 
outlaw or curb services that provide sexually explicit telephone commentary to 
callers. A 1989 Supreme Court decision struck down an existing "dial-a-porn" 
law as an infringement on free speech. The new language was signed into law by 
President Bush as part of HR 3566. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting to remove the language from the bill objected on procedural 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
They disliked the way the Senate had loaded up HR 3566 at the end of the 1989 
session with provisions not germane to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
They also objected to disregarding House rules and allowing an appropriations 
bill to be used as the vehicle for substantive changes in the law. 
</P>
<P>
But lawmakers on the other side of the issue said the House should seize the 
opportunity to move against dial-a-porn services. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to remove dial-a-porn language from the pending 
appropriations bill.

Deficit 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 272 to 128, the House approved a deficit reduction bill that puts 
the fiscal 1990 federal budget in compliance with Gramm-Rudman limits on annual 
indebtedness. The Senate then approved the measure by voice vote, and President 
Bush signed it into law. 
</P>
<P>
The "reconciliation" bill (HR 3299) would reduce red ink for the year that 
began Oct. 1 by at least $14.6 billion, lowering the deficit to the 
$110-billion level required by the Gramm-Rudman law. Legislated spending cuts 
would account for about $6.6 billion of the reduction and new taxes about $2.9 
billion. Forced across-the-board cuts, in effect until February under 
"sequestration" provisions, would reduce the year's deficit by $4.6 billion, 
and lower Treasury borrowing costs resulting from the bill would save $629 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Along with cutting the deficit and enacting new taxes in specialized areas of 
the economy, the bill makes several policy changes. For example, it reforms the 
way physicians are reimbursed under Medicare, prohibiting them from charging 
unreasonable fees that ultimately are paid by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The measure confronts the deficit more squarely than any of the annual 
reconciliation bills passed previously this decade. Still, it leaves 
entitlement programs virtually untouched, resorts to accounting gimmicks, such 
as moving the $1.8-billion Postal Service deficit and $420 million in Farm 
Credit System bailout costs "off budget," and once again pushes the most 
difficult fiscal and political decisions on taming the deficit into the next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey) said, "A yes vote provides for real 
deficit reduction." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Silvio O. Conte (R-Mass.) said the bill lacks "any significant effort 
to address the root cause of the deficit" entitlement programs. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the reconciliation bill.

Dial-a-Porn 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 98 to 306, the House refused to remove "dial-a-porn" language from 
the fiscal 1990 appropriations bill for the departments of Labor, Health and 
Human Services, andEducation (HR 3566). This preserved Senate language to 
outlaw or curb services that provide sexually explicit telephone commentary to 
callers. A 1989 Supreme Court decision struck down an existing "dial-a-porn" 
law as an infringement on free speech. The new language was signed into law by 
President Bush as part of HR 3566. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting to remove the language from the bill objected on procedural 
grounds. They disliked the way the Senate had loaded up HR 3566 at the end of 
the 1989 session with provisions not germane to the bill. They also objected to 
disregarding House rules and allowing an appropriations bill to be used as the 
vehicle for substantive changes in the law. 
</P>
<P>
But lawmakers on the other side of the issue said the House should seize the 
opportunity at hand to move against dial-a-porn services. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to remove dial-a-porn language from the pending 
appropriations bill.

SANTA MONICA AIRPORT DIRECTOR RESIGNS POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica Municipal Airport Director Hank Dittmar, who oversaw the recent 
renovation of the facility, has resigned to take a job with San Francisco's 
Metropolitan Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Dittmar, whose resignation is effective Jan. 5, said he is leaving the 
$71,500-a-year job because he thinks he has finished what he set out to do in 
Santa Monica, and because of the death of his wife last month. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited and sad to leave," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dittmar began his career with the city of Santa Monica in 1983 as a planner 
with the city's Municipal Bus Line. The next year, at the age of 28, he was 
named to head the airport by City Manager John Jalili. 
</P>
<P>
"We will miss him," Jalili said. "He is exceptionally capable." 
</P>
<P>
Dittmar implemented the provisions of an agreement between the city and the 
Federal Aviation Administration to upgrade the airport. A new administration 
building was recently completed, runways and taxi areas improved and a noise 
abatement program was developed. 
</P>
<P>
Dittmar also oversaw the addition of other facilities to the city-owned airport 
property, including the Museum of Flying, the DC-3 restaurant and a Santa 
Monica College satellite center. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was not directly involved in planning the proposed Santa Monica 
Common commercial development, Dittmar said it, too, represents a step toward 
making the airport a significant revenue source. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for the airport to contribute economically to the city," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In his new job, Dittmar will be project manager for the Southern Crossing, a 
proposed bridge across San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to facing new professional challenges, Dittmar said the death of 
his wife, Sarah, contributed to his decision to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been talking about going back up north for about eight months," Dittmar 
said. "But with her death it made even more sense. I don't like being around my 
house anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Dittmar, 33, died of complications from AIDS. Dittmar said she contracted 
the disease from her first husband, who died after contracting the disease, and 
that she had tested positive for the AIDS virus seven years ago. The Dittmars 
were married for three years. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope her death helps to make people understand that AIDS is an epidemic that 
reaches all parts of our society, including middle-class women," Dittmar said.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HULSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A brochure titled "Privacy in Paradise" is available from Creative Leisure 
International. Features 52 apartments/resorts on Maui, Molokai, Kauai, Oahu and 
the Big Island. Everything from beach-front condos to three-bedroom homes. A 
seven-night package figures out to $494 per person, based on two vacationers 
traveling together. Includes the round-trip flight from LAX, taxes, a lei 
greeting, limousine service from the airport and return. Creative Leisure 
offers a money-back service warranty. (On request the company will prepare 
customized vacation plans for travelers.)

Skier Hot Line: A new hot line for skiers is providing reports on more than 150 
resorts across the nation. Information on weather/road conditions, day/night 
skiing, snow depths. Callers learn whether trams and gondolas are operating. 
(The weather report is updated hourly.) 
</P>
<P>
Here's how it works: Press 1-900-WEATHER plus the area code for the city 
nearest the resort you intend to visit. Skiers calling Denver, for example, 
would be given ski conditions for Arapaho Basin, Breckenridge, Keystone, Winter 
Park, Loveland, Eldora Mountain, SilverCreek, Steamboat. The service is 
operated by American Express. Callers pay 75 cents per minute. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas in Arizona: America's most unusual Christmas tree is a blinking 
attraction in Chandler, Ariz. Composed of a thousand tumbleweeds, the unusual 
"tree" is the state's answer to an old-fashioned fir. The citizens of Chandler 
sprayed the tumbleweeds with 25 gallons of paint, showered the pile with 50 
pounds of silver glitter and strung together 1,500 lights. Of an evening, it 
flashes like a beacon in the clear Arizona atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sheraton San Marcos Resort has put together a Tumbleweed Holiday 
that's pegged at $79 a night (single or double occupancy), including film with 
which to photograph the tree. For reservations, dial (602) 963-6655. 
</P>
<P>
Currency Guide: The big money changer, Ruesch International, has published a 
new currency guide for Europe, Australia/New Zealand. Besides listing currency 
values, the guide also contains information on tips in various European 
countries.

currencies, foreign bank drafts and traveler's checks, plus conversion of 
value-added tax refund checks into U.S. dollars. Other details by telephoning 
(213) 277-7800, or by writing to Ruesch International, 1925 Century Park East,

all Bay Area public transit agencies: BART, CalTrain, Golden Gate Transit, AC 
Transit, San Francisco Muni, Santa Clara County Transit, SamTrans. There are 
also maps of San Francisco, San Jose, Berkeley, Oakland. The guide tells about 
airport bus/limousine, taxi services/fares. Pinpoints dozens of destinations.

</P>
<P>
A Small Hotel: On Nov. 12 in Travel Tips we described the small Fielding Hotel 
in London's Covent Garden area as "not luxurious, but reasonable" and with 
rooms that are "modest." Several readers insist the more accurate description 
would be "seedy." This wasn't the case several years ago when we surveyed 
London's little hotels for our readers. Mike Manfro of Banning wasn't 
disappointed. He describes guest rooms as "small but comfortable" and adds that 
the baths have only recently been refurbished. Still, because our readers have 
been mostly negative, we are striking The Fielding from our list of recommended 
hotels. Here's what LeAnne E. Maillian of Beverly Hills said of the Fielding: 
"It's not a hotel, it's an embarrassment." And Jack Toomey of Granada Hills 
complained that "although there were no blatant inaccuracies in your 
description of the Fielding . . . the scene was grim." 
</P>
<P>
Bye-bye Fielding. 
</P>
<P>
Reader Recommendations 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii -- Mary Lee Gaylor, Culver City: "Recently stayed at Lampy's Bed &amp; 
Breakfast, 6078 Kolopua St., Kapaa, Kauai, Hawaii 96746. As a former resident 
of Hawaii, to me this is what Hawaii is all about. Nestled behind Sleeping 
Giant Mountain, with fresh fruit right off the trees. You can prepare your 
meals in a fully equipped kitchen. Cost is $55 nightly for one or two persons. 
As an experienced traveler who has been all over the world, I highly recommend 
Lampy's." 
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands -- Donald Selten, Los Angeles: "The most remarkable restaurant 
I have encountered in many years of travel to Europe, and I feel fairly 
qualified as I have been in the restaurant and food business for well over 35 
years. It's De Wenteltraf, Vijzelstraat 43-45, Amsterdam. A set menu for less 
than $10 U.S." 
</P>
<P>
England -- Ruth Shayne, Los Angeles: Praises Knightsbridge Service Flats, 45 
Ennismore Gardens, Knightsbridge, London SW7 1AQ, England. A block of 12 studio 
flats within walking distance of Knightsbridge and Harrods, and two minutes 
from Hyde Park. Rates between 320 and 340 per week. 
</P>
<P>

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: THERE IS ROOM AT THE INN, EVEN SO CLOSE TO CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
December is here, and that means you are suddenly being confronted with the 
painful panic of holiday travel decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Myriad possibilities assault you. You could go skiing in Colorado or St. 
Moritz. You could sun-worship on the beaches of Hawaii or the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
You make a few calls, all to no avail. You can get a flight to Aspen, but it's 
an expensive ticket. And even with the air fare, you can't book a hotel room; 
Aspen is full. Your travel agent says you might be able to get that room in 
Hawaii, but also says that you can't get even a single seat on an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
The travel clock is ticking and you have nowhere to go, right? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of great places to go for the holidays, and you can still get 
some great deals. You just need to know where to look. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some last-minute holiday travel suggestions for this year: 
</P>
<P>
First, there are organizations and travel clubs that specialize in last-minute, 
deeply discounted travel. At this time of the year, you're not the only one who 
might be panicking. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels, airlines and some cruise lines share your desperation. An empty room, 
seat or cruise berth is their worst nightmare. When a room, seat or berth goes 
unsold, that's income those companies will never realize, a loss of revenue 
they can never recoup. 
</P>
<P>
At some times of the year supply clearly outdistances demand, explaining why so 
many discount fares and rates are offered by airlines and hotels during soft 
travel periods in January and February each year. 
</P>
<P>
But at many destinations and on popular airline routes, anticipated demand 
doesn't always materialize, and more often than not, this happens at the last 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
How do you find out about that room that just opened in Aspen or that two 
airline seats suddenly became available to Maui? 
</P>
<P>
You can start by being your own best travel agent. As peak seasons approach, 
check with hotels directly. 
</P>
<P>
Do not call those toll-free 800 numbers of the larger chains. There are two 
good reasons for this. First, most of the time the toll-free numbers simply 
connect you to a sort of central clearinghouse for a hotel chain. 
</P>
<P>
More often than not, their information on available rooms is not up to date 
because each hotel only allows 800-number services to sell a certain number of 
rooms -- but not all of the rooms that are, or could be, available for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Another good reason for not using the toll-free numbers is price. There's a 
good chance -- in fact, there's an excellent chance -- that if a room is indeed 
available, you will be quoted a high, or perhaps the highest, published rate 
for that room. 
</P>
<P>
This is the one time you should avoid using the toll-free number. Instead, 
spend a few dollars and contact the hotel you had in mind directly. It's been 
my experience that you can almost always negotiate a better rate with hotels 
directly than you can by using a travel agent or going through a toll-free 
reservation system. 
</P>
<P>
Especially at this time of year, hotels will charge what they think the market 
will bear, but if a hotel or resort suddenly finds itself confronted with a 
dozen unsold rooms right before the holidays, it will be eager to drop its 
rates significantly to fill them. 
</P>
<P>
If the thought of holiday travel, or schlepping through crowded airports and 
suffering untold delays, turns you off (and why shouldn't it?), consider a 
great mini-vacation idea. 
</P>
<P>
Think of the best, most exclusive hotel or resort in your own community. With 
few exceptions, those hotels will all have empty rooms during the holidays. And 
almost all of them have created interesting Christmas vacation packages 
(extensions of their already discounted weekend rates), with lots of extra 
goodies thrown in, ranging from Christmas parties and midnight caroling to 
special programs for children. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Christmas packages can make great gifts. I've also found that during 
holiday periods, because fewer people are staying at the hotels, the service 
tends to be better. 
</P>
<P>
Again, it's better to check with the hotels directly about packages, and to 
negotiate your own deal. At this time of year the hotels know that to receive, 
they have to give. 
</P>
<P>
While this process works well with hotels for last-minute travel, it usually 
accomplishes nothing with airlines and cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, finding a discount air fare at this time of the year is virtually 
impossible. Maxsaver and other discounted fares were sold months ago, and even 
if seats have opened, every airline will sell those seats at full price. 
</P>
<P>
So how do you beat the system? By buying a last-minute travel or tour package 
that already includes air fare. 
</P>
<P>
This is where the travel clubs come in. There are dozens of them, membership 
groups that specialize in last-minute, discounted travel. 
</P>
<P>
You can usually find them advertised in newspapers and travel magazines. 
Membership costs range from $19 to $100 a year and usually include a 
newsletter, travel hot line and substantial discounts. 
</P>
<P>
And the destinations? We're not talking about a hotel near an industrial waste 
site in some Third World backwater. They are, for the most part, good and great 
destinations (or cruises to same) that haven't been filled. 
</P>
<P>
They go by such names as "Stand-buys," "Preferred Traveler Club," "Vacations to 
Go" and "Quest." 
</P>
<P>
Some specialize in airline and hotel deals while others concentrate solely on 
cruises. Join the club that offers you the type of travel you like. 
</P>
<P>
A club run by an airline is called the Getaway Club, and it's owned by TWA. 
It's a clever idea (begun a few years ago by Eastern Airlines with a similar 
program called the Weekender club) that allows the airline to market deeply 
discounted air and hotel deals at the last minute on flights that aren't fully 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
But this club is really intended for TWA to unload its unsold inventory of 
weekend seats, and trips offered by the airline usually don't last more than 
five days. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are travel agencies that specialize in nothing but last-minute 
travel. One is called World Wide Cruises and, as its name implies, this Ft. 
Lauderdale, Fla., agency focuses on nothing but discount deals on cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got lots of deals on the Caribbean this year," said spokesman Don Nagel. 
</P>
<P>
You can thank Hurricane Hugo for all of the discounts. It seems that when the 
storm struck the Caribbean in mid-September, many folks simply canceled their 
cruise reservations. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many cruise lines have ships sailing that are half full, and the 
deals are very attractive. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a seven-day Commodore Cruise to the Caribbean (leaving on 
Saturday) normally costs $1,245 per person. But World Wide is selling the same 
cruise for as little as $849 per person, including air fare. 
</P>
<P>
And if you can handle your own air arrangements to Miami, the same seven-day 
cruise (to San Juan, St. John, St. Thomas and the Dominican Republic) leaving a 
week later (Dec. 23) will only cost you $699 per person. 
</P>
<P>
And a two-week, Christmas/New Year's Caribbean cruise on Sun Lines (Dec. 20 
through Jan. 3) is selling for as little as $2,499 per person, including air 
fare (regular price is $3,240 per person). 
</P>
<P>
For those who don't just want discounts in December, some travel clubs work 
great deals all year. One is called Quest. Membership is $99 a year and 
entitles you to a 50% discount on available rooms at Holiday Inns, Hiltons and 
other chains. 
</P>
<P>
One word of caution: When quoted a discount, always ask upon what rate the 
discount is based. If you're getting a 50% discount but that discount is based 
on the highest published fare, you don't have to be a math whiz to realize that 
it's not much of a deal. 
</P>
<P>
A second word of caution: In joining any travel club or in buying any travel 
deal offered by that club, never pay with cash or check. Protect yourself -- 
use your credit card. That way, if the deal isn't delivered as advertised, you 
can dispute the charge with your credit card company.

JUNE LAKE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the June Mountain ski area seems to be a secret, that's all right with the 
folks who live in this alpine village or come here for a quiet holiday. Let the 
downhill hot-doggers and apres-ski people have their fun over the ridge at 
Mammoth Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
June Lake is host to couples looking for seclusion and families who just want 
to spend some time together. 
</P>
<P>
Many accommodations include kitchens, enabling guests to cook for themselves 
rather than dining out. 
</P>
<P>
A ski school for children offers special instruction for 3- to 12-year-olds. 
For novice skiers there are packages with equipment, lifts and lessons. Of the 
35 runs down June Mountain, 35% are designed for beginners, 45% for 
intermediates and 20% for advanced skiers. 
</P>
<P>
This year, beginners are guaranteed to learn to ski or they get the first 
lesson again for free. 
</P>
<P>
June's ski area has become a haven for snowboarders, who look like out-of-water 
surfers riding down the slopes on single wide boards. A new challenge for them 
is a 450-foot chute called the Half Pipe, where snowboarders show off their 
acrobatic skills along the chute's high sides. Snowboard lessons and rentals 
are available, and championship races are set for January. 
</P>
<P>
June Mountain ski area in the eastern Sierra is just off June Lake Loop Road 
(California 158), a narrow highway flanked by sheer slopes, lakes that are 
sometimes frozen and the tall pines of Inyo National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
First-time skiers arriving at the parking lot may be frightened by the steep 
terrain in front of them, but most of the runs begin and end higher up the 
mountain, including flat, wide areas for beginners and gentle, rolling trails 
for intermediates. 
</P>
<P>
The base lodge is June Meadows Chalet, a four-minute ride up the mountain face 
in novel QMC (Quad Mono Cable) tram cars that hold 20 passengers. They climb 
more than half a mile to the chalet, where six chairlifts continue to the 
10,135-foot summit of June Mountain and slightly lower Rainbow Summit. 
</P>
<P>
The rental shop, ski school and snowboarding chute are at the chalet, which 
features a cafeteria where breakfast and lunch are served. Meals also are 
served on the sun deck during weekends and holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Non-skiing visitors can take the QMC Tram to the chalet to eat and sightsee. On 
Friday and Saturday evenings, special buffet dinners are offered between 5:30 
and 9 p.m. A round-trip ride on the tram costs $7, children $3.50. 
</P>
<P>
Skiers pay $35 for an all-day lift ticket, children 7-12 years old pay $17. 
Kids 6 and under and seniors 65 and older ski free. 
</P>
<P>
A detailed booklet for both June Mountain and Mammoth Mountain ski resorts is 
available by calling (619) 934-2571. For current snow and ski conditions at 
each area, call (213) 935-8866 from Los Angeles, (714) 955-0692 from Orange 
County or (619) 231-7785 from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Lodging facilities for June Mountain are scattered in the village of June Lake 
and along June Loop Road. After a snowfall, that road is closed at the 
electrical power station near Silver Lake and becomes a scenic trail for 
cross-country skiers. 
</P>
<P>
Nordic skiing also is popular on trails groomed by the U.S. Forest Service east 
of U.S. 395 by June Lake Junction, the turnoff for California 158 to the 
village and downhill ski area. If those trails are melted, cross-country skiers 
go a few miles south to the Obsidian Dome Trails at the Glass Flow Road 
turnoff. For details, contact the ranger station: (619) 647-6525. 
</P>
<P>
Skis, poles and boots for both nordic and downhill skiing can be rented in June 
Lake at Ernie's Tackle &amp; Ski Shop. Snowboards, toboggans and discs for 
sledding also are available. Call (619) 648-7756 for rental rates and shop 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
The village does not offer many diversions for shoppers, although you can visit 
the Tree Wizard Gallery to watch Gary Burns fashion artworks from wood burls. 
He carves them with power tools in a workshop at the rear. Also displayed in 
the gallery are batiks and pottery created by Burns' wife, Sallee. 
</P>
<P>
The Tree Wizard Gallery is adjacent to the Country Store, the tourist 
information center for June Lake. It is on California 158 just beyond the huge 
balancing boulder that marks the entrance to town; look for the Mobil gas sign 
and BP gas pumps. Hours are 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. You also can call (619) 
648-7584 for visitor information. 
</P>
<P>
The Country Store rents videotapes and sells post cards, sweat shirts and other 
June Lake souvenirs. A short stroll up the road is Geri's Gift Box next to 
Schat's Bakery. The major place to buy groceries is the June Lake General 
Store. 
</P>
<P>
Two restaurants in town are open in winter -- the Sierra Inn Steak House and 
Coffee Shop, and its neighbor, the Tiger Bar and Cafe. Both serve breakfast, 
lunch and dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Farther along the June Loop Road and beyond the ski area is Carson Peak Inn, 
considered June Lake's best restaurant. It opens daily at 5 p.m. for dinner. 
The popular Mountain Rose dinner house has closed. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen varied accommodations are scattered along the highway, beginning with 
Boulders Lodge at the top of town and ending with Whispering Pines Motel &amp; 
Cabins and Dream Mountain Resort near where the road is closed off after a big 
snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
Whispering Pines has kitchen-equipped motel rooms that sleep four for $55 a 
night on weekends, $45 midweek. A-frame cabins that sleep up to eight and have 
kitchens are $125 on weekends, $115 midweek. Call (619) 648-7762 for 
reservations. 
</P>
<P>
The major booking company for lodgings is June Lake-June Mountain Reservations. 
Call toll-free (800) 648-2211. 
</P>
<P>
Two other services arrange accommodations, especially condominiums: June Lake 
Properties Reservations, (800) 648-5863, and Rainbow Ridge Realty and 
Reservations, (800) 462-5589. 
</P>
<P>
Get to June Lake from Los Angeles by driving north via Interstate 5 and 
California 14 (or Interstates 10 and 15) to join U.S. 395. Continue north about 
15 miles beyond the Mammoth turnoff to California 158, then go west two miles 
to the village. Round trip is 650 miles.

FOOTLOOSE: WEEKLY DANCE KEEPS FISHING VILLAGE JUMPING

CASTRIES, St. Lucia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every Friday evening, locals and visitors on this Caribbean island get together 
in the little fishing village of Gros Islet for a "jump up," a free-wheeling 
street dance complete with calypso and reggae bands, barbecue, rum drinks and a 
carnival atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The fun began about five years ago when a rum shop began to ladle out music and 
barbecue with its potions. Other bars and restaurants soon joined in with their 
own bands, and what started as an impromptu affair has grown steadily into a 
popular weekly event. 
</P>
<P>
Gros Islet's jump up is a perfect example of the relaxed friendliness and good 
spirits of St. Lucians, whose island gained full independence as a member of 
the British Commonwealth in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Columbus did or did not land here on one of his voyages isn't really 
important to today's visitor. What is important can be found by anyone seeking 
a small and unspoiled island, tropical flowers and fruit in abundance, scores 
of uncrowded beaches and coves, plus weather to make one forget the wet lash of 
winter back home. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly American, Delta or Eastern to San Juan, Puerto Rico, then 
American Eagle on to St. Lucia's Vigie Airport in Castries. American and other 
airlines fly into larger Hewanorra Airport 40 miles south. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? It doesn't make much sense to stay less than a week, and 
some stretch it much longer. Lodging costs are moderate in summer, creeping up 
from Christmas to April-May. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The local dollar is worth about 38 cents U.S. Temperatures 
hover in the 70s and 80s all year, but humidity can make afternoons rather 
sultry. Hurricane Hugo left no marks on St. Lucia. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Halcyon Beach Club (three miles from Castries; $140 to $160 
double, winter; $100-$125 summer) on the west coast overlooks a beautiful, 
palm-fringed beach. It's a huge place with spacious lawns and gardens, and 
vines with lavender flowers or bougainvillea crowning each unit's veranda. 
There's a pool, open-air restaurant, children's playground with supervision and 
a wharf with yet another restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The Islander (Rodney Bay; $95 double, winter, $65 summer) has 40 doubles, plus 
20 one-bedroom studios with kitchens ($105 winter, $70 summer). Like the 
Halcyon, children under 12 stay free. While the Islander has the open and airy 
feeling of most hotels here, it's not on the beach, though a van takes guests 
there. It has a half-pension plan for $22, $18 for children, as well as a 
terrace bar and restaurant by a large pool ringed with hibiscus. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Lucian (seven miles from Castries at Reduit Beach; $190 B&amp;B double, 
winter; $105 summer) has about everything a St. Lucian hotel can offer. There's 
a fine beach, two excellent restaurants that won almost every ribbon in a 
recent competition with other island hotels, three bars, tennis courts, a dive 
shop, windsurfing, evening entertainment and a live band for dancing, plus a 
disco. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: When asked about island food, a native said: 
"Dumplings, crab and callaloo is all you need to know." We had trouble finding 
the dumplings, which are usually served at home, but crab and the delicious 
callaloo (a spinach-like green) were on every menu. 
</P>
<P>
Another delectable discovery was creamed chrystophene, a hot or cold soup made 
with a white, squash-like fruit. The chilled version is much better than 
vichyssoise. Pumpkin soup, hot or cold, is another delicious island staple. 
</P>
<P>
Caribbean and Atlantic seafood (tuna, kingfish, prawn, octopus, lobster) take 
their rightful place on the table, often given a curry or creole treatment 
common on the island. You'll also find a lot of breadfruit, banana bread and 
plantains. 
</P>
<P>
Heineken beer is brewed here, but we still prefer Jamaica's Red Stripe, 
available everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: The Lime (Rodney Bay) is an open and very bright place where the 
accent is on creole dishes, fish and chicken. There's the after-work crowd that 
stops by for a cooler, another crowd for candlelight dinners and a third that 
hangs on well into the night. 
</P>
<P>
Rain (Columbus Square, Castries) takes its name from the Somerset Maugham 
story, and the green-and-white gingerbread Victorian at town center almost 
outdoes Maugham's tales for color. Have lunch on the patio under a mango tree 
or dinner on an upstairs balcony overlooking the square. The menu runs the 
course of island fare, with late entries scribbled on a blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
Combine an hour's boat trip (four hours by car) to the town of Soufriere on the 
southwest coast and lunch at Anse Castenet, a wide-open restaurant on the beach 
that keeps a grill going with brochettes of beef, fish, prawn and chicken. The 
house specialty is beef Maniere Mama Moi, made with sweet and hot peppers, 
garlic and cinnamon. Delicious. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: Hotel La Toc (Vieux Fort, three miles from Castries, 
$215-$250 double, winter; $140-$175, summer-fall) is owned and operated by the 
Cunard shipping people. It's sheer elegance from bow to stern. Set on 110 
wooded acres beside a pristine beach, La Toc's rooms are gorgeous. 
</P>
<P>
They also have 54 individual villa-suites on a hill overlooking the sea 
($350-$500 double, depending on season and location), many with private pool on 
the deck. 
</P>
<P>
La Toc's Les Pitons dining room, named for the twin peaks that are a St. Lucia 
landmark, is presided over by a Michelin two-star chef, and that just about 
says it all for the fine food. 
</P>
<P>
Yet until we find a better one, San Antoine (on a hill above Castries Harbor) 
gets our vote as the Caribbean's very best and most romantic restaurant. A 
former private home and later a hotel, it caught fire in 1970. Only the thick 
stone walls, arches and stairwells survived, but the building has been fully 
restored. 
</P>
<P>
For the meal nonpareil, try the fruits de mer en papillote, prawns in a Pernod 
sauce, crayfish with garlic butter or filet au poivre vert. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Start with a turn through Castries, where your first concern is 
deciding which is more colorful, the market or cathedral. The former, very 
Victorian and painted fire-engine red, spills onto surrounding streets of 
curbside vendors hawking the fruit, flowers and vegetables of the island. The 
cathedral, meanwhile, has an interior that is a vibrant rainbow of color and 
native art. 
</P>
<P>
Getting about the island (27 by 14 miles) isn't all that easy by car. So why 
not take a boat from Castries down to Soufriere for a look at Les Pitons? The 
Unicorn, a 140-foot brig with 6,000 square feet of sail, makes the run daily, 
and features a steel band, rum punch, fried chicken and other enticements. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Call the St. Lucia Tourist Board at (212) 867-2950, or 
write (820 2nd Ave., 9th Floor, New York 10017) for brochures on the island, 
including a map.

THREE LOOKS AT THE OLD WEST AND THE OLD WORLD

<TEXT>
<P>
Old West buffs can follow the trail of early gold seekers through the ghost 
towns of the Western states, while others join a search for the Loch Ness 
monster in Scotland or else explore the beautiful Portuguese island of Madeira. 
These are the offerings in this month's selection of video adventures. 
</P>
<P>
"GHOST TOWN HUNTERS" (Cleval Video Ltd., 50 minutes, 1989.) Mingling clips of 
old Hollywood Westerns, newsreels and still photos with scenes of today, Will 
Rogers Jr. takes viewers through some of the many ghost towns of the Western 
states. Maps and advice are provided to assist the explorer and provide 
entertainment for the armchair traveler. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the towns are deserted ruins, some just a pile of rubble. Others are 
semi-ghost towns where a few die-hards hang on, while still others are tourist 
towns such as Calico, Calif., where the video takes viewers to an old-fashioned 
hootenanny. 
</P>
<P>
There are some reassuring scenes of one man's efforts to preserve and restore 
the town of Gold Point, Colo., and of the progress some determined citizens 
have made in restoring the town of Goldfield, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
California sights include Gold Discovery Park at Caloma, the frog-jumping 
contest at Angels Camp and the new historical park at Bodie, which is being 
preserved in "a state of arrested decay." 
</P>
<P>
In Nevada the viewer visits revitalized Virginia City (site of the famed 
Comstock Lode), Austin, Ione, Belmont and Rhyolite, with its house built of 
50,000 beer bottles. 
</P>
<P>
The video then heads to Arizona, where it follows horseback riders to Vulture, 
whose buildings are constructed of gold-bearing rocks. Viewers get to meet some 
of the old timers who followed the trail of gold. 
</P>
<P>
Other towns include Jerome, where preservationists are struggling to prevent 
the town from sliding downhill to oblivion; Oatman, which was brought back to 
life for the filming of "How the West Was Won," and Gold Road, where the adobe 
buildings are slowly eroding. 
</P>
<P>
Video highlights are the realistic re-creations of the flood that destroyed 
Panamint City above Death Valley, and of the fire that wiped out Rawhide, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
The film concludes with a visit to Shasta, Calif. The town was rebuilt of stone 
after a fire destroyed it, but today it is once again a ghost town. 
</P>
<P>
Film quality is excellent and Rogers' narration is informative and pleasant. 
There are no hotel or restaurant recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Cleval Video Ltd., 30 25th Ave., Suite C, Venice, 
Calif. 90291, (213) 821-9233. Price: $29.95. 
</P>
<P>
"BONNY SCOTLAND" (Traveloguer Collection, 60 minutes, 1987.) Sherilyn Mentes' 
Scottish heritage and extensive research are evident in her video, which takes 
the viewer from the southern Borders area of Scotland north to the Orkney and 
Shetland islands. To the skirl of bagpipes, viewers travel through cities and 
isolated villages to beautiful heather-covered hills, misty moors and historic 
ruins. 
</P>
<P>
The film is of fine quality and the narration is filled with history and legend 
that make it of special interest to both the armchair traveler and the returned 
traveler. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to Glasgow includes the lush botanical gardens and the colorful Lord 
Provost parade, a tour of the Museum of Transport and a cruise on the Firth of 
Clyde aboard the historic paddle steamer Waverly. 
</P>
<P>
South of Glasgow is the rural area of the Borders where the precious crop of 
barley thrives. Stops include a distillery where "barley juice" (Scotch whisky) 
is made. 
</P>
<P>
Before heading for Edinburgh, the video takes a circuitous route to Robert 
Burns' birthplace at Alloway, then over to Blair Atholl Castle, home of King 
Duncan, whose death at the hands of Macbeth of Moray served as the basis for 
Shakespeare's "Macbeth." Side trips take viewers to the grave of Robert the 
Bruce at Dunfermline and the birthplace of American industrialist Andrew 
Carnegie. 
</P>
<P>
In Edinburgh there are the usual scenes of Edinburgh Castle, the Royal Mile, 
Holyrood House, Princes Street, a kilt shop and the grave of the faithful 
terrier, Greyfriars Bobby. 
</P>
<P>
From the herring-fishing center of Ullapool in the Highlands the video heads 
down to Inverness, the site of the Culloden battlefield, and to the ruins of 
Urquhart Castle overlooking Loch Ness. A boat takes viewers on a search for 
Nessie and for a scenic ride down the Caledonian Canal. At the Nevis River, you 
see hardy souls riding the rapids in inflatable rafts. 
</P>
<P>
The video winds up with a tour of the Hebrides, Isle of Skye and the Isle of 
Harris, home of Harris tweed; the Orkney Islands, with the Stone Age village of 
Skara Brae, and the Shetland Islands for a cruise on a replica of an old Viking 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
Traveloguer films are made by professional film makers for theater presentation 
and have been edited for home viewing. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Traveloguer Guide, 3301 W. Hampden Ave., Suite N, 
Englewood, Colo. 80110, toll-free (800) 521-5104. Price: $29.95, including a 
small reference guide with a map, history and some travel tips and customs. No 
hotel or restaurant recommendations are given. 
</P>
<P>
"MADEIRA" (Travelview International, 50 minutes, 1988.) You are introduced to 
Madeira, "the Pearl of the Atlantic," through a map showing its location, 600 
miles southwest of Lisbon, and through scenic aerial views of the island and 
its capital, Funchal, with its colorful red-tiled roofs cascading down the 
steep hillsides to the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Created by volcanic eruption, the island offers some incredibly beautiful 
vistas of mist-covered peaks; high, sheer cliffs; waterfalls, and green 
terraced fields. 
</P>
<P>
In Funchal, viewers visit historic churches and museums housing art and 
religious artifacts. One is the former home of Joao Goncalves Zarco, who 
discovered the island in 1420. There also are visits to the botanical gardens 
and an open-air market. 
</P>
<P>
In nearby Monte a magnificent view of Funchal is shown from the steps of the 
hilltop Church of Nossa Senhora do Monte. At the foot of the steps is a popular 
toboggan run, where visitors in wicker sleds mounted on wooden runners take the 
20-minute slide down to Funchal. Specially trained guides control the toboggans 
over the narrow cobblestone path. 
</P>
<P>
At a lookout point a few miles west of Funchal you look down on the little 
fishing village of Camara de Lobos, with its brightly painted fishing boats. 
It's a favorite subject for photographers and painters. 
</P>
<P>
Along the road from Funchal to the north coast, especially between Porto Moniz 
and Santana -- with its brightly colored thatch-roof houses -- the video shows 
some of the island's most breathtaking scenery. In some places hairpin turns 
overlook deep valleys on one side and sheer drops to the sea on the other. 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights are stops in the wine country and the village of Camacha, the 
center of the wicker industry. 
</P>
<P>
The video is aimed at the travel planner, with the travelogue section taking up 
the first third, followed by a segment on shopping, dining and night life, 
including scenes of the elegant casino. 
</P>
<P>
The final third is devoted to film (sadly, some of the same film seen in the 
previous segment) and narration about hotels and resorts, plus tips on climate, 
transportation, currency, language and tipping, furnished by Berlitz travel 
guides. 
</P>
<P>
The film quality varies from good to too dark. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Travelview International, 5630 Beverly Hill, Houston, 
Tex. 77057, (800) 325-3108. Price: $29.95.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: STUDY EXAMINES TRAVEL TASTES AND MOTIVATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HUGHES, Hughes is a 30-year veteran travel writer living in Sherman 
Oaks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're a mature traveler, a recent study by an international marketing 
consulting firm indicates you probably fall into one of four general 
categories: Upbeat Enjoyers, the Insecures, the Threatened Actives and the 
Financial Positives. 
</P>
<P>
The travel motivation study, conducted by Strategic Directions Group Inc. of 
Minneapolis, was based on a national check of the attitudes of 600 mature 
travelers ranging in age from 50 to 85. The study covered a wide variety of 
subjects: physiology and health, life style, purchasing patterns, finances, 
residence, demographics and media usage, plus choice of travel destinations and 
mode, frequency and type of travel. 
</P>
<P>
Those questioned had to rank 60 statements on how they felt, a procedure, the 
company says, that forced them to make choices and prioritize their feelings. A 
computer program then mathematically compared how each participant ranked each 
statement. The following segments were then developed from the mathematical 
relationships: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Upbeat Enjoyers make up 20% of the group, with an annual household income 
of $26,390. They are interested in activities, feel financially comfortable and 
think the best years of their lives are still to come. About 37% are retired. 
Most are three to five years younger than the other average groups. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Insecures: 32% of the sample group (the largest segment), with a 
household income of $12,719. They are pessimistic about the future, and believe 
aging is a negative process. They are the only segment interested in discounts 
offered by hotels and airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Threatened Actives: 26% of the group. They are concerned about being crime 
victims, and driving their cars and living in their own homes is of primary 
importance. With an average household income of $11,434, they make up the 
largest retired segment (59%). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Financial Positives: 23% of the group, with an annual income of $30,080. 
They feel financially secure and have a positive outlook on life, are looking 
for value, feel lucky and want to look as young as possible. About 50% are 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
Some other notations and preferences within the segments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Upbeat Enjoyers and Financial Positives clearly prefer cruises. About 12% 
in those segments have been on a cruise, compared to 8% of the Insecures and 2% 
of the Threatened Actives. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Upbeat Enjoyers take the most escorted tours, 38% having taken at least one 
in the last five years, compared to 24% for all the other respondents. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Although overall only 8.3% of those questioned plan on visiting Europe 
within the next two years, 20% of the Upbeat Enjoyers and 12% of the Financial 
Positives said they were planning such a trip. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Financial Positives travel much more than any other segment. More than 
50% of this group have taken three or more trips of more than two days in the 
past year. By contrast, only 32% of the Upbeat Enjoyers, with the 
second-highest household income, had taken three or more trips. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Of the four segments, highest use of cars on vacation was reported by the 
Threatened Actives, 81% of whom take a motoring vacation. This contrasted with 
56% of all others. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Driving one's car does not appear to be related to age or income. Fifty-two 
percent of the Financial Positives reach vacation destinations by car, and just 
as many who are over age 65 do so as those between 50 and 65. 
</P>
<P>
Railroad buffs among mature travelers might already know that Canada's Via Rail 
will soon drop train service from Banff to Vancouver. Marlene Gordon of The 
Next Stage has booked space on the last scheduled run over that scenic route, 
and combined it with an all-rail trip from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Set for Jan. 9-18, the trip includes sleeper accommodations, four nights in 
Vancouver and three in Banff, plus the last ride on the Via Rail out of Banff. 
Tour price starts at $1,200 per person, double, and rail accommodations vary 
from roomette to drawing room. For more information, call (213) 939-2688.

BARGAIN CORNER: COUPONS DISCOUNT SOUTH PACIFIC HOTELS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you happen to be traveling to the South Pacific, look into the possibility 
of using coupons offered at 45 hotels through the Southern Pacific Hotel Corp. 
The coupons can be used at properties in Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti and 
Fiji. 
</P>
<P>
You have to buy a minimum of 12 coupons at a cost of $40 per coupon. Two to 
four coupons are required for a one-night stay, except in Tahiti, where five to 
seven coupons may be needed, depending on whether you have a regular or 
above-the-water room. 
</P>
<P>
And the number of coupons needed may be higher during the high season, which 
lasts until the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
An SPHC spokeswoman estimated that by using the coupons, travelers can expect 
to receive discounts ranging from 15% to 30% during the high season, and 15% to 
20% in the off-season, May through September. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels take part in the program on a space-available basis, so it's possible 
that the coupons may not always be usable in heavily booked periods. Check in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
The coupons have to be purchased in the United States. They're valid for all of 
1990 and don't have to be used on consecutive nights. Room reservations can be 
made either before departure or overseas. It's always a good idea to book your 
first night abroad before leaving the United States. 
</P>
<P>
When traveling, reservations may be made for you at no extra charge for either 
the same country or in another country. For example, one property can process 
your reservation at the next property within Australia, as well as in New 
Zealand, Fiji or Tahiti. 
</P>
<P>
Cities with participating hotels include Sydney, Melbourne, Cairns, Canberra, 
Brisbane, Darwin and Alice Springs in Australia; Auckland, Rotorua, Wellington, 
Christchurch and Queenstown in New Zealand; Suva and Nadi in Fiji, and Papeete, 
Tahiti. 
</P>
<P>
Children 18 or younger can stay free when sharing a room with an adult. 
</P>
<P>
No refunds are offered if you don't use all of the minimum of 12 coupons. But 
if you buy more than 12, you can get a refund for any extra unused ones, less a 
handling fee of $10 per order. 
</P>
<P>
Contact travel agents or Southern Pacific Hotel Corp. either toll-free at (800) 
252-2155 or at (213) 557-2424. JACK ADLER

CONSUMER REPORT: DARK CLOUDS HANG OVER 8% AIRLINE TICKET TAX; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: PEOPLE WHO DON'T FLY AFTER PURCHASING A TICKET SHOULD GET BACK THE 8% 
DOMESTIC TAX THEY PAID, EITHER FROM THE AIRLINE OR FROM THE INTERNAL REVENUE 
SERVICE. 
</P>

<P>
If you buy a discount airline ticket with a cancellation penalty and then don't 
fly, you would get a refund minus the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the 8% domestic tax? Is it refunded in full or do you get back 
the tax that is the same percentage as the cancellation penalty? Or do you lose 
the tax? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it depends on the cancellation penalty and the airline. And industry 
observers believe that there should be a full tax refund, with the cancellation 
penalty only applying to the fare. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an IRS ruling to clarify the situation, there still seems to be 
industry-wide differences among the airlines on refund policies concerning this 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
An Internal Revenue Service spokesman said an airline can refund the same 
percentage of the tax as used for the cancellation penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up to the airline to ask for the refund, as the code doesn't require it," 
the spokesman said. "The refund should be in proportion to the cancellation 
penalty, and whatever amount isn't funded to the passenger has to be given to 
the IRS." 
</P>
<P>
For example, however, what if you purchase a nonrefundable ticket and then 
don't fly. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole amount of the tax is due the government," the IRS spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS made a ruling (No. 89-110) in September because of queries made by 
passengers, airlines and its own representatives. 
</P>
<P>
But not all airlines have the same policy. 
</P>
<P>
USAir refunds the entire tax if someone cancels on a fare with a penalty, plus 
the appropriate amount of the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were a $100 fare with a 50% cancellation penalty, the passenger would 
get back $58. If it were a nonrefundable fare, the entire tax would go to the 
IRS, and it would be up to the passenger to file the appropriate claim for it," 
a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Delta Air Lines, however, refunds the same proportion of the tax as called for 
by the cancellation penalty on the ticket. "Passengers would get back, for 
example, half of the tax, if the cancellation fee was 50%. But if it's a 
nonrefundable fare, we turn the entire amount over to the IRS. It doesn't pay 
for us to issue checks for these amounts," a Delta spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers, however, can always apply to the IRS for a refund of the tax on a 
nonrefundable fare, the Delta spokesman added. "The tax on fares is a user tax, 
and if the passenger doesn't use the service, the tax is no longer due." 
</P>
<P>
However, the IRS spokesman said that refund of the 8% domestic air tax would 
have to come from the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The Delta spokesman also said that the airlines could argue the tariffs filed 
by the carriers governing the contract between the airline and the passengers 
have language that indicates the amount paid for the fare will include any 
applicable tax. "This has been a very gray area.". 
</P>
<P>
A Chicago law firm, Block &amp; Levy Associates, has filed separate 
class-action suits going back to 1985 against United and American Airlines, 
alleging that these two carriers did not make proper refunds of the 8% domestic 
air tax to passengers. The firm is seeking recovery for affected passengers, 
according to Alvin Block. 
</P>
<P>
Block said his firm had also filed a class-action suit against Western Airlines 
on the same issue, which was settled earlier this year by Delta, which absorbed 
Western. 
</P>
<P>
"Delta gave passengers who had not received the proper refund of the 8% tax a 
choice of a cash refund or some options with frequent-flier credits," Block 
said. He added that the cases with United and American are still pending. 
</P>
<P>
"Most airlines except these three have offered the right refund of the tax in 
the past," Block said. "But previously, the IRS had been silent on this issue 
and some airlines simply held on to the tax money or portions of it, depending 
on the specific fare, without refunding any part of it to passengers who 
canceled their flights on discount fares with penalties." 
</P>
<P>
Millions of dollars have been collected by the airlines on these cancellation 
penalties since those types of fares came into usage, according to Block. "Now 
the tax law has been amended so that if the airlines keep any part of this 8% 
tax, they have to turn it over to the IRS. There's no more windfall or unjust 
enrichment of the airlines." 
</P>
<P>
Where does all this leave consumers? "Still fending for themselves, unless 
they're protected by a class-action suit," Block said. "If you don't fly, there 
should be no tax due, and consumers should be able to get back the entire 
amount of the tax paid, even with nonrefundable fares." 
</P>
<P>
Marsha Scott of Glendale Travel said: "As agents for the airlines, we follow 
their policy, which is generally to refund the same percentage of the domestic 
air tax as applies to the cancellation penalty on that fare. 
</P>
<P>
"The domestic tax is quoted as part of the fare, so most passengers aren't 
really that conscious of it, but a great deal of money is involved when you 
consider all of the tickets written with cancellation penalties and the number 
of passengers who actually cancel these flights." 
</P>
<P>
The system permits agents to refund some of the tax amount on other fares with 
cancellation penalties, said Scott, so there should be no problem doing it with 
nonrefundable fares as well.

"Literary Britain" unearthed old memories of one of my own precious literary 
moments in England. First it was the train to Windsor, the tour and a picnic 
lunch across the river from the castle. Then down narrow country lanes to the 
quaint village of Stoke Poges, the setting for Thomas Gray's immortal poem, 
"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard." It was a mystical experience.

PRAGUE: REBIRTH BY STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
CZECHOSLOVAKIA: THE OPPOSITION WON THE FIRST ROUND OF REVOLUTION. NOW COME 
HARDER QUESTIONS: WHO WILL GOVERN, HOW TO PROCEED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Karel Kovanda, Karel Kovanda, a student dissident in Prague, 1968, now a 
computer-industry manager in California, was sent to Czechoslovakia by Global 
Outlook news service. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SANTA CRUZ 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The current Prague revolution began without me in mid-November; my anguish 
about sitting in Santa Cruz increased daily until I grabbed an opportunity to 
go back to Czechoslovakia, to visit the city where I grew up, attended college, 
earned my first political credentials as a dissident -- the city where old 
friends are often closer than brothers. 
</P>
<P>
This revolution is not much like the Prague Spring of 1968. First, this is 
indeed a revolution; 1968 was a reform. No matter how strong the push of 
popular forces, no matter how enlightened the leadership of Alexander Dubcek, 
the 1968 process was managed -- and its limits dictated -- by the Communist 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989 no such limits are apparent. The Communist Party is being swept away, 
almost as an irrelevant irritant, stripped of its hitherto constitutionally 
guaranteed "leading role." This is a step we never dreamed of in 1968. The 
country is heading for free elections; the Communist Party might win only 10% 
of the electorate, losing two-thirds of its own members' votes. In 1968, such 
results were unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone I saw in Prague was astonished by the speed of change: They talked 
about 10 years for Poland, 10 months for Hungary, 10 weeks for East Germany and 
10 days for Czechoslovakia. Not boasting -- pure wonderment. They understood 
that speed was multiplied by developments in other East European countries; 
there could have been no Prague without a Warsaw, no Prague without a Budapest 
or Berlin. But they also told each other that speed is testimony to the 
rottenness of the old regime. 
</P>
<P>
Dizzying speed, however exhilarating, makes it hard to see where you are going. 
The leadership of the Civic Forum, an umbrella group that has emerged as the 
most powerful opposition voice, relies on a handful of individuals who carry 
extraordinary physical and psychological burdens. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Vaclav Havel, the best-known personality of the Forum, has more 
mandates than minutes. He is needed everywhere simultaneously: to negotiate 
with the government, to confer with colleagues, to meet emissaries from the 
provinces, to address the public, to draft documents, to comment on position 
papers. To maintain some semblance of physical control, Havel seems to travel 
with a half-dozen karate experts -- guarding him from journalists as much as 
from other dangers. When I saw him in Prague at the end of November, the strain 
showed. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum was operating out of execrable spaces. Headquarters were in the 
basement of the Laterna Magica theater in the center of Prague: only a couple 
of telephones, none with multiple lines; no copying machines on site, never 
mind faxes or computers, no secretarial support to speak of. Information flowed 
by courier. The press of people trying to get into the basement was constant. 
Only one narrow section of the entrance was kept open; a visitor's business had 
to be ascertained before entry to the foyer of the theater; to reach the 
basement, one needed a special pass reserved for Civic Forum activists. 
</P>
<P>
An old friend from 1968 was my passport. Vlado Prikazsky is a former radio 
journalist who covered "our" student strike in November, 1968. He was kicked 
off the air during subsequent government purges. Now Vlado is back in action, 
part of the Civic Forum, one of dozens of old friends reunited after more than 
20 years. With each of them, I continued interrupted conversation. The only 
evidences of time passed were our graying hair and pictures of 15-year-old 
children. 
</P>
<P>
The old friends helped reconstruct what had happened. The first phase of the 
revolution erupted on Friday, Nov. 17, when a special unit of riot police from 
the Interior Ministry savagely beat up as many as 2,000 demonstrators, most of 
them students. The assault was unprovoked; the protest was nonviolent. The 
demonstrators' only crime was failure to disperse; instead, they sat down on 
the cold Prague pavement and refused to budge. Vlado took me to the site; the 
pavement has become a little shrine, adorned with dozens of candles. 
</P>
<P>
Police brutality lit the fuse. Over the weekend, students made nationwide plans 
for a general strike and people started gathering in the city center, at 
Wenceslas Square. The regime realized it had gone too far; the Wenceslas Square 
crowd was not attacked. On Nov. 20, the demonstrators issued a list of demands, 
vowing to strike until demands were met. 
</P>
<P>
This is a students' revolution. They spearheaded it, had the courage to face 
police, mobilized the population at large -- frequently against the wishes of 
parents who had found a way of cohabiting with the regime. 
</P>
<P>
I visited a couple of universities and talked to striking students. They wanted 
to know about Prague Spring -- about democratic political processes the regime 
never taught. 
</P>
<P>
The students were joined in the strike by actors who added professional skills 
to convey the message, helping win over factory workers. In the battle for 
hearts and minds, Communist Party propaganda hacks were completely outclassed. 
Theaters were open every evening for panel discussions with students and other 
opposition speakers. And every night every house was packed. 
</P>
<P>
During my visit, what can best be described as a revolutionary gala was held at 
the National Theater. Arias from Bedrich Smetana's patriotic operas were 
sandwiched between appearances by popular scholars and actors -- some of whom 
had been banned from the stage for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
This has been a disciplined, gentle, even good-humored revolution. Hundreds of 
thousands of people gathered daily in city center, with no police presence. Not 
a single window was broken. Current playfulness contrasts dramatically with the 
dourness of the Communist Party. A Hungarian dissident addressed the crowds one 
day and apologized for his awkwardness with the Czech language. The crowd 
roared immediate response; one man yelled, "He speaks better than Jakes," 
referring to Milos Jakes, the former party boss famous for his inability to 
string a decent sentence together. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Nov. 21, a loudspeaker was installed on Wenceslas Square. Civic 
Forum leaders could at last address the throng and the people took direction. 
From then on, revolution was unstoppable -- short of a Tian An Men Square 
massacre. Even the soon-to-be deposed apparatchiks didn't have the stomach for 
that, although there is evidence that militia troops were brought in to the 
outskirts of Prague from outlying areas. 
</P>
<P>
The people have won the first phase hands-down. The opposition demands 
presented to Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec were accepted -- including free 
elections. Then Adamec resigned. His designated successor was Marian Calfa. The 
people were still unsure last week. They had won but could hardly believe it. 
It all seemed too easy. 
</P>
<P>
A more difficult phase has opened, with questions about composition of the 
government, the timing of elections, the identity of Civic Forum -- a political 
party or a Solidarity-type trade union? Prime ministers change within days. 
Real economic and social difficulties remain. Parties spring up from nowhere, 
frequently representing no more than the megalomania of individuals. 
</P>
<P>
The chasm between freedom of speech and freedom to vent hot air grows more 
apparent. No multiparty elections have been held since 1946. Ignorance about 
the democratic process, about electoral systems, about campaign mechanisms is 
endemic. 
</P>
<P>
Yet fundamental assets are equally apparent: a smart people who will work hard, 
determined to end the nightmare of communist control. Many of us who have been 
biding time abroad are now deciding how best to contribute to the new 
Czechoslovakia, the one students have freed.

NO YELLOW-BRICK ROAD TO INSURANCE REFORM; 
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIA: THE RACE FOR STATE COMMISSIONER DRAWS FEW INCUMBENTS; THEY SEE IT 
AS A 'LOSE-LOSE' JOB. A 'PEOPLE'S CZAR' IS UNLIKELY TO MAKE CHANGE. 
</P>

<P>
If you liked "The Wizard of Oz," you'll love the race for California insurance 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
That's doesn't mean the sweeping insurance reform approved by voters last year 
is the stuff of children's fiction. The public's frustration over soaring 
premiums was real. That is why Proposition 103 passed -- to cut rates, crack 
down on insurers and require that the state's insurance commissioner be 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative's proponents argued that neither the Deukmejian Administration 
nor the Legislature could be trusted to clean up the insurance mess. Special 
interests -- particularly the insurers and attorneys whose contributions 
finance political campaigns -- would continue to block relief. 
</P>
<P>
Electing the insurance commissioner, supporters promised, would make that 
office more accountable and responsive to policyholders' concerns and help 
"ensure that insurance is fair, available and affordable for all Californians." 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics worried that an elected commissioner "would be a politician first and 
a regulator second," because of the need to raise campaign money from the same 
interests the office regulates. 
</P>
<P>
The voters opted for change. But more than a year after passage of Proposition 
103, full implementation is still stalled, the 20% rollback requirement has 
been overturned by the state Supreme Court and few people have seen rate 
reductions. Roxani Gillespie, Gov. George Deukmejian's appointed insurance 
commissioner, has been agonizingly slow in putting a new insurance system into 
place. So the focus of reformers, the media and ambitious politicians has 
turned toward election of a "people's insurance czar" in 1990. Will this be the 
magic formula to bring about elusive reform? Or will that office fall prey to 
the temptations of "business as usual"? Early dynamics of the race for 
commissioner offer clues. 
</P>
<P>
Three things have become readily apparent. Among the active potential 
candidates, traditional politicians are scarce. There appears to be a dearth of 
Republicans vying for the office. And candidates are making promises that 
should be carefully examined by California voters. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the 1988 election, Gillespie firmly asserted, "I have no 
intention of running. I am not a politician." Smart move. She had become the 
focus of the voters' frustration. 
</P>
<P>
But the new powers of her office and the siren song of incumbency seemed to 
have had an effect. She attempted to shake her foot-dragging, pro-industry 
image and established an exploratory campaign committee to raise funds. Then 
last week she abruptly announced her withdrawal from the race, in the face of 
discouraging public-opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
Former Huntington Beach Mayor Wes Bannister, an insurance broker who promises 
to order a 20% rate rollback, is now the most visible GOP candidate for 
nomination. In the wake of Gillespie's departure, it remains to be seen whether 
a "name" Republican challenger will emerge. 
</P>
<P>
On the Democratic side, State Board of Equalization member Conway Collis, the 
only formally declared candidate, has flatly declared, "I will lower insurance 
rates." That may not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his endorsement by Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield, Collis 
suffers from being "the politician" in the current Democratic pack. 
Rosenfield's support and grass-roots organization should help any Democratic 
candidate. But Collis has found it difficult to overcome the public perception 
that Rosenfield traded his support for Collis' fund-raising assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Although Los Angeles television commentator Bill Press mounted an abortive 
campaign for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate and served in the Edmund 
G. Brown Jr. Administration, the public doesn't seem to perceive him as a 
politician. And Press has important name recognition, particularly in Southern 
California. These are pluses. 
</P>
<P>
Press has vowed to abolish the "territorial system" of basing insurance rates 
on where drivers live (Gillespie last week directed that the territorial system 
not be the prime determinant of insurance rates). Press' promise could backfire 
when voters in other areas of California learn that their rates could rise to 
compensate for the loss of insurance revenue from currently redlined urban 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Democrat Walter Zelman is also moving closer to a formal declaration of 
candidacy. Zelman suffers from low name-recognition but fares better when 
linked with Common Cause, the reform-oriented public interest group he served 
as California director. Using Common Cause on his ballot designation could give 
Zelman significant credibility. 
</P>
<P>
But Zelman's candidacy may promote a split among various consumer groups, and 
he must share with Press and Collis the traditional Democratic fund-raising 
founts of San Francisco and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Zelman may have other problems. He has criticized the influence of money in 
politics, yet he refused to abide by his suggested limit on campaign 
expenditures unless the other candidates agreed -- not likely. He would hold 
government to rigid standards, but his proposal restricting contributions from 
trial lawyers would exempt friends who do "a little ambulance chasing once in a 
while." (Most potential candidates have already forsworn insurance-industry 
money as the electoral kiss of death.) 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the "phantom candidate," Voter Revolt's own Harvey Rosenfield. He 
won't run for insurance commissioner himself -- perhaps he fully comprehends 
the pitfalls of direct accountability. But, dissatisfied with the 
implementation of Proposition 103, he has proposed yet another initiative -- to 
establish a state-run automobile insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
The job of insurance commissioner has not attracted high-profile candidates. 
Many officeholders view it as a "lose-lose" race. Politicians -- particularly 
legislators -- have been identified as part of the problem. The public does not 
trust them to become part of the solution. 
</P>
<P>
Some incumbents fear that this springboard to higher office could easily become 
a slide to ignominious retirement. Anyone who does the necessary job, bringing 
rationality to the insurance system, will alienate everybody -- insurers, 
consumers, attorneys. That's political suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the commissioner's role has been to ensure the solvency of 
companies and require a reserve adequate to protect policyholders' claims. As 
the post becomes more political, there will be pressure to "play to the crowd," 
to focus on lowering prices without acknowledging the dangers. 
</P>
<P>
A meat-ax approach to lowering insurance rates might lead to the collapse of 
weaker insurance companies, drive big insurers out of California and reduce 
competition. That would leave California policyholders as vulnerable as the 
victims of the savings-and-loan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
To duck that issue is demagoguery. It wouldn't be the first time that 
demagoguery provided the winning formula, but it won't solve the long-term 
problem. There are few incumbents willing to risk that failure and end their 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
And what about the dearth of Republicans? Deukmejian, and most other Republican 
officeholders, opposed Proposition 103; the public perceives them as too cozy 
with big business. Gillespie's departure only underscores the GOP problem. 
</P>
<P>
The events of the past year indicate that hopes that an elected commissioner 
would cut through the Gordian knot of insurance reform will not be realized, 
despite the candidates' pledges. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Wizard of Oz," Dorothy and her friends return to the wizard, having 
done everything he demanded. But he still stalls about keeping his promises. An 
angry Cowardly Lion roars, exposing -- behind all the special effects -- a 
little, old man. 
</P>
<P>
It was all just make-believe, the Wizard confesses: "I'm just a common man." 
But, wails the Scarecrow, "you're more than that -- you're a humbug!" 
</P>
<P>
No matter how sincere the candidates for the new post of California insurance 
commissioner are in their promises to bring the big, bad insurance companies to 
their knees, it's all humbug. Californians are likely to be as disappointed as 
Dorothy and her friends: Life's problems are not resolved as easily as a wizard 
-- or political candidate -- promises.

MALTA: MARKING THE MEETING WHERE SUPERPOWER PROSPECTS FOR COOPERATION OUTWEIGH 
COMPETITION.

<P>
The Malta summit was clearly a success for both Presidents George Bush and 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. They placed U.S.- Soviet relations on a more even keel. 
Yet the inability of superpower leaders to control, or even foresee, the 
buffeting storm that compelled a change in plans seemed to symbolize the limits 
of their power in dealing with such elemental political changes as those now 
sweeping Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In historical perspective, Malta may come to be seen as the first post-Cold War 
meeting to create a new relationship between East and West, a new Europe, even 
a new world. The summit did not "end the Cold War," but illuminated a maturing 
in which prospects for cooperation outweigh continuing superpower competition. 
</P>
<P>
Malta has not been the only significant summit. For all its overdramatization, 
the first Richard M. Nixon-Leonid I. Brezhnev summit in 1972 opened up a 
prospective detente. Though it was unsustained, it was a foundation. The first 
Ronald Reagan-Gorbachev summit, in 1985, marked a change from the confrontation 
of the early 1980s -- a shift only Reagan could have managed without sharp 
domestic struggle. The Reagan-Gorbachev summits renewed a process Bush and 
Gorbachev can carry further. 
</P>
<P>
While Malta marks a step forward, the future management of East-West relations 
will increasingly depend on Europeans rather than superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
For all their historical and cultural ties to Europe, and their geopolitical 
clout, the United States and the Soviet Union remain peripheral to the heart of 
Europe. Neither can exclude the other from Europe -- as people on both sides 
have tried in the past. Even today, some, blinded by Cold War thinking, argue 
that Gorbachev is trying to divide the United States from Europe, when it is 
patently clear he wants the United States in Europe. This is far from the last 
bilateral superpower summit, but the future will ineluctably bring multilateral 
summits. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was not called on at Malta to respond to Gorbachev's earlier proposal for 
an early summit meeting of leaders from 35 nations, all joined in the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). But both Gorbachev and 
Bush saw the CSCE process as the framework for dealing with the issue of German 
reunification. 
</P>
<P>
The creation of a new security regime for Europe is also a growing requirement 
as military force has become less central to security. Judging from his 
post-summit comments at Brussels, Bush apparently does not yet see as clearly 
as Gorbachev the new role the two alliances can play in cooperatively 
contributing to achieve mutual security -- but the process is under way. And 
Bush did suggest joint U.S. and Soviet support for convening a multilateral 
summit to sign a Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) agreement once negotiated, 
preferably in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Malta was originally billed as an "interim summit" and, for all its symbolic 
significance, it was. No agreements were concluded, or even negotiated. Yet the 
meeting provided for a joint resolve to press ahead on the strategic-arms 
negotiations (START), an interim U.S.-Soviet agreement to cut chemical weapons 
arsenals and the CFE conference. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's proposal to open negotiations on global naval-arms control and, in 
particular, to ban tactical nuclear weapons at sea, did not gain Bush's 
acceptance. The issue will not, however, fade away. Gorbachev also raised the 
subject of military doctrine -- an item not in Bush's brief, but on the agenda 
for experts' talks in February in the CSCE framework. These talks will probably 
spur a discussion of "deterrence" and may well spark some controversy before 
yielding greater mutual understanding. 
</P>
<P>
Bush seems more optimistic than others -- more than Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III and even Gorbachev -- on the possibility of completing START 
negotiations by mid-June. But a jump-start to revive negotiations is in order 
even if agreement cannot be reached by June -- and, of course, with enough will 
it could. 
</P>
<P>
In U.S.-Soviet affairs, the focus at Malta was economic. Bush took the 
initiative by doing what he could to bolster the Soviet economy. He offered 
steps to normalize trade relations by granting most-favored-nation status. He 
also promised to seek the end of legislative bars to credits -- though the size 
of future credits may not be large. More broadly, Bush promised to support 
Soviet observer status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- 
bringing Moscow into the world economic structure. Gorbachev was clearly 
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
The area of greatest uncertainty at Malta involved "regional conflicts" -- the 
pockets of geopolitical friction between allies and clients of the two 
superpowers. Most noted has been the matter of Nicaragua sending arms to 
insurgents in El Salvador -- but the differing views, while real, were limited. 
Gorbachev agreed with Bush on free elections in Nicaragua, on opposing the 
transfer of arms to Salvadoran rebels and on resolving conflicts by political 
means. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said the Nicaraguans had assured the Soviets they were not sending 
arms. Bush insisted, with good basis, that the Nicaraguans were -- but accepted 
Gorbachev's account and blamed Nicaraguan leader Daniel Ortega for lying. (Bush 
may have been aware of the discovery, from recently captured SA-7 anti-aircraft 
missiles, that these were not manufactured in the Soviet Union.) 
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed on supporting peace efforts in Lebanon. Bush evidently 
urged Gorbachev to establish relations with Israel -- already in the works. 
They agreed that exchanges of intelligence and other cooperation against 
international terrorism are useful. 
</P>
<P>
Much was done. But the most important result is a rapport evident in the 
leaders' collaborative fielding of questions at the unprecedented, and 
unplanned, joint press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have criticized the summit as a "giveaway" by Bush are wrong on all 
counts. He didn't "give up" pursuit of conventional-force reductions nor "give 
in" by reviving START-CFE as a multilateral negotiation. Gorbachev has already 
made major concessions in CFE and obviously wants it; START is no less a U.S. 
interest than a Soviet one. The U.S. steps toward normalizing economic 
relations are due. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has clearly decided that to aid Gorbachev is in the interests of the 
United States and the world, as well as the Soviet Union. That is no 
"giveaway." It is new thinking by Bush in response to new thinking, and deeds, 
by Gorbachev -- and should be welcomed. At Brussels, Bush himself emphasized 
that Gorbachev's response to the situation in Eastern Europe and his readiness 
to accept disproportionately larger conventional-arms reductions in Europe 
"deserves" and "mandates" new thinking on our part. A competition in new 
thinking would be a more significant result of Malta than dramatic rhetoric 
couched to sound like more than it really meant.

TODAY'S STATE LEGISLATORS ARE NO LAUGHING MATTER; 
</P>

UNFUNNY ACTS: POLITICS NOW TENDS TO BE GRIM STUFF, BUT IN CALIFORNIA'S PAST 
THERE WERE GAGSTERS WHOSE HUMOR HELPED SOLVE PROBLEMS.

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifteen years ago, Californians were treated to a radio commercial by Bill 
Bagley, the Republican candidate for state controller. 
</P>
<P>
"My opponent is 6 feet, 7 inches tall, obviously too tall to be state 
controller," Bagley said in the radio spot. Late on election night, Bagley 
received a telegram from the victor, Democrat Ken Cory: 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Bill, You are obviously too short to be state controller." 
</P>
<P>
The likelihood of this kind of whimsical exchange taking place in California 
today is about 1 in a zillion. Elective office is no longer temporary public 
service -- it is a deadly serious business, with every legislator presiding 
over a personal industry handling about a million dollars a year; the size of 
the enterprise is substantially higher for statewide officeholders. 
</P>
<P>
In the era of such somber politicians as George Deukmejian, John Van de Kamp, 
Pete Wilson, Alan Cranston, Tom Bradley, David Roberti, Leo McCarthy and Gray 
Davis, zany characters are as scarce as soft-shoe dancers. None of the above 
would dare kid around with solicitations to a campaign fund-raiser, as Cory 
once did. Cory's embossed invitations set the dinner price at $100, but added 
an asterisk after the amount. At the bottom of the come-on, in tiny type, the 
invitee was informed: "* Roquefort dressing, 25 cents extra." 
</P>
<P>
Although Gov. Deukmejian opens each speech with a joke supplied by his aides, 
he's hardly a natural funnyman. Among California's crop of high officeholders, 
Wilson tries hardest to be a humorist, with occasional success. He's developed 
a one-liner routine that includes a list of oxymorons -- those common phrases 
with built-in contradictions -- he says he developed to entertain himself while 
sitting in a near-empty Senate chamber. Wilson's list includes postal service, 
senatorial courtesy, House ethics and domestic harmony. Wilson's top priority 
nowadays is building a war chest for his 1990 gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary campaign fund-raisers are often priced at $1,000 a plate -- and 
dinner may not be included, let alone Roquefort dressing. The hors d'oeuvres 
are free, but those who want to drink will belly up to a "no-host" bar. And the 
entertainment won't be provided by Pat Paulsen and Jay Leno, but by windbags 
offering "testimonials" to the beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the heyday of the California Legislature, politicians didn't take 
themselves as seriously. One day, Assemblyman Edwin L. Z'berg of Sacramento was 
making an impassioned plea on behalf of a bill. Toward noon, the hard-drinking 
presiding officer felt the need for refreshment and interrupted Z'berg in 
mid-sentence: "Mr. Z'berg, the Sacramento Bee (then an afternoon newspaper) has 
just gone to press." Z'berg sat down without finishing his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
That was the era of Speaker Jesse M. Unruh, when the California Legislature was 
held up as a model for the nation. Legislators also played partisan games back 
then, but they operated in an atmosphere of camaraderie that almost always 
produced solutions to major problems. In the past two decades, California has 
lost much of its political sense of humor, something that might help more than 
package after package of so-called political reforms. Skillful lawmakers like 
former Assembly Speaker Pro Tem John T. Knox of Richmond quit, simply because 
"it isn't any fun anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Unruh, enjoying the Speakership from 1961 to 1968, was a master of the quip and 
some of his observations have become part of the capital's permanent lore. It 
was Unruh, later state treasurer, who said, "Humility in the face of ability is 
hypocrisy." He justified a bizarre new political alliance by stating, "If I'd 
slain all my political enemies yesterday, I wouldn't have any friends today." 
And he paid tribute to the bargaining prowess of former Assemblywoman Pauline 
L. Davis of Portola this way: "With Pauline, a fair deal is when you give her a 
$30-million dam in her district and she tells you what a nice tie you're 
wearing." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the old hands, including Knox and Bagley, think there is a direct 
connection between the near-disappearance of humor from the political scene and 
failure of the system to solve problems. Humor helped create an environment in 
which compromise, not stalemate, was the likely outcome of conflict. 
Participants who have fun together can bridge partisan gaps more easily than 
those who treat politics as a life-or-death struggle between competing 
ideologies. 
</P>
<P>
During happier times, the Legislature had its share of members who 
unintentionally injected levity into the proceedings. There was Assemblyman Don 
Allen of Los Angeles, who gave a long speech one day in favor of a bill -- and 
then voted against it. His explanation to reporters: "I wasn't very 
convincing." (When he was a Los Angeles councilman, Allen would tell 
colleagues, "I'm with you -- all the way to the roll call.") Former Sen. 
Lawrence E. Walsh of Huntington Park held up a newspaper headline warning of 
"fiscal chaos," but he pronounced it "fiscal chose" -- as in gross. 
</P>
<P>
For more than two decades, the Capitol was kept amused by the antics of a 
single legislator, Charles W. (Jimmie) Meyers of San Francisco. According to 
legend, Meyers was first elected after a San Francisco political boss boasted 
in a bar that he was so powerful that "I can get anyone elected, even the next 
guy that walks into this bar." The next guy, supposedly, was Meyers. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Meyers was known as "the author of last resort." If 
sponsors couldn't get any one of the other 119 lawmakers to introduce their 
legislation, they would settle for Meyers. The result was that Meyers dropped 
hundreds of bills into the hopper just before the deadline. This inevitably 
produced a logjam of Meyers bills in the gate-keeping Ways and Means Committee. 
One year, the committee chairman told Meyers that all his bills would die 
except one -- and Meyers had to choose the lone survivor. After his tough 
decision, the committee designated the measure the Charles W. Meyers Janitorial 
Services Act. The bill was trashed on the Assembly floor. 
</P>
<P>
In today's deadpan political world, campaign managers rarely dare humor. 
Consultant Richie Ross violated the rule three years ago while running a 
low-budget campaign on behalf of then-Assemblyman Alister McAlister of San 
Jose, who was seeking the Democratic nomination for state controller. In an 
attempt to get some attention, Ross plastered the state with signs calling 
McAlister "Honest McHonest." For his efforts, Ross was criticized by California 
political writers for running the worst campaign of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The strait-laced McAlister did his bit to end the era of good feeling in 
Sacramento. Just after his election, he and other newcomers participated in an 
orientation program that included social functions as well as lectures. One 
lobbyist casually asked McAlister whether he preferred to be called Al or Mac. 
The response: "To you, I'm Mr. McAlister."

BUSH, A GIVING GUY, GETS NOTHING; 
</P>
<P>
SUMMIT: PRESIDENT OFFERED ALL HIS CONCESSIONS WHEN HE SAT DOWN AT MALTA. HE MAY 
HAVE MADE THEM TO A CORPSE.

<TEXT>
<P>
In his new biography, "George Bush, an Intimate Portrait," former diplomat 
Fitzhugh Green describes a character trait associated with the President since 
childhood: his extraordinary generosity. 
</P>
<P>
Green writes: "George was the most giving individual, offering to share 
anything and everything -- from food, to toys, to clothes -- with the others. 
They nicknamed him, 'Have Half' for this trait." 
</P>
<P>
Generosity has helped make George Bush a popular man all of his life. But there 
is a question as to whether this disposition, on display at Malta and Brussels, 
well serves U.S. strategic interests. 
</P>
<P>
At Malta, Bush offered all his concessions as soon as he sat down, before 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had a chance to speak. He would grant, 
Bush said, favorable trade terms, if only Moscow codified its emigration policy 
on Soviet Jewry; he then committed the United States to a new arms agreement by 
June. Taken aback by the sweep of the Bush concessions, Gorbachev gave nothing 
in return. 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, Bush told NATO that we would keep U.S. troops in Europe, as long 
as our allies wanted them, and he signed on to the conditions, sought by 
Britain and France, before Germany is reunited: 
</P>
<P>
"Unification should occur in the context of Germany's continued commitment to 
NATO, an increasingly integrated European Community, and with due regard to the 
legal role and responsibilities of the Allied powers . . . moves toward 
unification must be peaceful, gradual and part of a step-by-step basis . . . 
lastly, on the question of borders, we should reiterate our support for the 
Helsinki Final Act." 
</P>
<P>
Unsurprisingly, Bush departed to a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
One high official was quoted as saying that at Malta, Bush agreed to conclude a 
START agreement by June, so that Gorbachev could take something home to the 
Soviet military. If so, that official has lost his marbles, for the President 
painted this country into a corner. 
</P>
<P>
The START agreement entails deep cuts in U.S. missile silos and submarines, 
cuts that are terribly risky in a world where the Red Army could suddenly hold 
dictatorial power in Moscow. And a START agreement means indefinite 
postponement of strategic defense. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of discussing missiles, which are yesterday's agenda, and utterly 
irrelevant to the crisis in Europe, Bush should be talking about getting 
Russian troops out. In the six months since he proposed cutting U.S. and Soviet 
troop levels to 275,000 on each side, even the Bush plan has been overtaken by 
events. With the people of East Europe demanding that Soviet armies pack up and 
go home, why sign an agreement legitimizing a permanent Red Army presence? 
</P>
<P>
Nor was Bush's affirmation of the Helsinki Final Act, which ratified the land 
grabs of the Hitler-Stalin pact, a wise move. Why commit America to the 
finality of borders imposed by Stalin? 
</P>
<P>
In agreeing to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's insistence that U.S. 
troops remain in Europe, Bush gave up all of his bargaining leverage. What is 
the British-French game? Paris and London want the United States to remain at 
risk, in the event of war; they want the United States to continue carrying a 
defense burden that belongs to Europe; they want a permanent U.S. presence in 
Germany, because they fear and distrust the Germans and secretly share Moscow's 
desire that Germany remain divided. 
</P>
<P>
Why is this in America's national interest? Why should we be delighted with a 
situation, where, if ever an unstable Europe explodes, the United States is 
automatically at war? Why set new conditions for German reunification, when the 
rush of history is already making them irrelevant? Why extend trade credits to 
a Kremlin with enough cash on hand to give Fidel Castro $5 billion annually to 
attack our interests in Central America? Borrowing the title from book that 
tops the best-seller list in Japan, we need "An America That Can Say No." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's desire to help Gorbachev is understandable, but he must know that a U.S. 
President's embrace cannot help Gorbachev in a showdown with Moscow 
hard-liners; and, if a showdown is coming with anti-Communists, we ought not to 
be on Gorbachev's side. 
</P>
<P>
In Eastern Europe, the revolution is gaining momentum. The old Stalinists and 
orthodox Communists are history. Now it is the turn of the reform Communists, 
whose role model is Gorbachev. In Czechoslovakia, East Germany and the Soviet 
Union, the idea is taking hold that the whole rotten system can be overthrown. 
It is not impossible that Bush made his Malta concessions to a corpse. 
</P>
<P>
In Tehran, in 1943, one hour of U.S. concessions guaranteed half a century of 
Cold War. Bush's concessions at Malta are much less dramatic and unlikely to 
prove remotely so significant. Franklin D. Roosevelt faced a bloodthirsty 
dictator at the peak of his power, but Bush is talking to the czar of an empire 
in collapse. 
</P>
<P>
But, still, the United States needs and lacks a vision of a new world and "new 
thinking" to realize that vision. And in its absence, that vacuum is being 
filled by Europeans, East and West, who have their own nationalist axes to 
grind. 
</P>
<P>
Communism's crisis is deepening. Czechoslovakia and East Germany are close to 
chaos. Either the Communists there make a stand soon, or they pass into 
history. Now the spotlight shifts back to the Soviet Union, and the same 
question reasserts itself. Will the party of Lenin go quietly to its grave? 
Will the Kremlin permit Stalin's empire to fall apart without a fight? With 
such questions extant, it is folly for America to be chatting up deep cuts in 
the great arsenal of Democracy that has kept the peace.

SCHOOLS FAIL LATINOS IN ANY TONGUE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: THE 'CRISIS' OF TOO FEW SPANISH-SPEAKING TEACHERS IN L. A. IS 
GROUNDED IN YEARS OF INSTITUTIONAL NEGLECT.

It's hard to be sympathetic with the Los Angeles Unified School District's 
expressed frustrations in coping with 170,000 limited- and non-English-speaking 
students (90% of whom are Latino). I cannot help asking, whose fault is it? 
</P>
<P>
The crisis in our schools did not come about by osmosis; it was the result of 
demographic changes that happened openly, and it was predictable. 
</P>
<P>
About a decade ago, Mexico's economic slide and wars in Central America created 
a flood of immigrants here. Add to this surges in Asian and Middle Eastern 
immigration, and the result is overcrowded and chaotic inner-city schools 
staffed by overworked people who cannot communicate with the students. 
</P>
<P>
In fairness to L.A. school administrators, some have lately seen the light and 
attempted to attract bilingual teachers by offering a $5,000 annual bonus. The 
district also has developed a well-defined master plan for bilingual education. 
This is a start. But there are still glaring contradictions. The irony of the 
district sending recruiters to Spain and Mexico to find qualified 
Spanish-speaking teachers is too much to take. Why, when the United States has 
a Latino population of more than 15 million, can't we find Spanish-speakers at 
home?

One of the answers is that fewer Latinos are entering teaching. In 1977, 
nationwide 3,050 Latino college graduates received teaching certificates. Eight 
years later the number had declined to 2,533. 
</P>
<P>
Where are the Latino high school and college graduates? Surely, not all of them 
are opening doors in business and the professions. Their absence in teaching, a 
field traditionally attractive to first- and second-generation immigrants, is a 
measure of how public education is failing Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
The shortage of bilingual Spanish-speaking teachers and aides is just one of 
problems created by the district's failure to motivate Latino students to 
complete their education. 
</P>
<P>
There is obviously a link between the number of Latino teachers and the success 
rate of teaching strategies such as bilingual education. Close to 60% of the 
students in the L.A. district are Latino, while just over 10% of its teachers 
are (about 6% are of Mexican or Central American extraction). 
</P>
<P>
Latinos also suffer from their numerically small part in the teacher community, 
which because of its massive size, greatly influences the district's ideology 
and political makeup. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, the dearth of Latino teachers deprives all students of Latino 
role models, leaving them to the influence of TV stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
In a wider sense, the lack of representation cheats the Latino community 
intellectually, allowing English-only kooks like LEAD (the Learning English 
Advocacy Drive) to get away with idiotic questions: "The Irish, the Jews, the 
Italians and the Poles made it, what's wrong with you Mexicans?" Well, nothing 
is wrong with us Mexicans. The truth is that the public schools have not 
treated all groups equally. They slighted the first generations of European 
ethnics, only blessing their children or grandchildren, the so-called 
baby-boomers, with mass infusions of federal aid to education during and after 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
David Hayes-Bautista of UCLA, in his book "The Burden of Support -- Young 
Latinos in an Aging Society," underscores this historical fact, writing: "In 
1940 the average Anglo had only 9.8 years of schooling. Comparatively few 
Californians had graduated from high school, and college was but a distant 
dream for most." At the time, Latinos averaged 5.6 years of schooling. Forty 
years later, the Anglo average had climbed to 12.9 years, the Latino to 9 
years. The number of Anglo college graduates had tripled, from 7.2% to 21.2%; 
the Latino figure more than tripled, but from a meager 1.6% to 5.4%. In fact, 
if it had not been for mass federal and state aid, supplemented by the G.I. 
Bill, the descendants of the European ethnics would still be in factories (if 
they hadn't shut down or moved abroad). 
</P>
<P>
California, up into the 1960s, was a leader in per-capita expenditures on 
education. But as the Latino and minority populations grew, and as the baby 
boomers got older, California's commitment to excellence waned. In 1971, 
California was 19th in state spending; 12 years later it ranked 45th. Now, 
almost a decade of Gov. George Deukmejian's stewardship has pushed California 
into a runoff for last place, making sure that Latinos won't get the chance 
that the children of the Irish, Italians, Jews and Poles finally did. 
</P>
<P>
It is time to set the record straight: The great majority of Latinos in this 
country have never set foot in a bilingual classroom. What has failed them is 
good old American education; bilingual education had nothing to do with it. 
What is important about bilingual education is that it is an index of the 
education Establishment's commitment to the education of Latinos. Its demise 
could signal that American society has finally learned to live with and not 
apologize for a permanent underclass.

<P>
Uncharacteristically, the hard-liners have got it wrong. They are upset that 
President Bush gave away the store at Malta, dubbed "the Doormat Summit" by one 
critic. What happened? Bush went from interested spectator to Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's partner. He preemptively recalled all instruments of economic war 
(such as punitive tariffs) against the Soviet Union. He approved its symbolic 
entry into the West's economic system (observer status in the Western club of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). He gave Gorbachev and perestroika 
a political blessing to match the Pope's. 
</P>
<P>
He gave these concessions free -- before having received anything in return. No 
commitment to real economic reform. No pledges of good behavior in Central 
America. "Will someone tell me," asked a pained Richard Viguerie, "how it is in 
the interests of the Free World to save this failed, fatally flawed system?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer is simple: It is in the highest interest of the Free World to save, 
to whatever extent we can, Gorbachev, because Gorbachev -- not the withholding 
of GATT membership or squeezing the Soviets on Central America -- is the key to 
burying this failed, fatally flawed system. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-liners are missing the big picture. Their hearts are in the right 
place -- ice -- but they have got the tactics wrong. The terminal phase of the 
Cold War, as any war, should be focused on the center, not the periphery. The 
periphery was the major battleground when the center was untouchable. No 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that the Soviets are still acting duplicitously in Central America, 
still trying to hang on to Afghanistan. But these are peripheral issues. From 
the point of view of strategy, we don't particularly care right now if the 
Soviets insist on spending themselves dry in Havana and Kabul. We don't 
particularly care if Gorbachev refuses to release prices and make the other 
changes essential to reviving his economy. (In the end, what hard-liner really 
wants a revived Soviet economy? So why insist on real reform?) 
</P>
<P>
What we want is for Eastern Europe to irrevocably elude the Soviet grasp. The 
Soviet empire is in collapse at the center, where it counts. Every day that 
Gorbachev remains in power is another day of further collapse. Our preeminent 
interest, therefore, is to help Gorbachev remain in power. He has done more for 
"rollback" than John Foster Dulles could have dreamed. 
</P>
<P>
We need a year. Within a year, Eastern Europe could be entirely out of the 
Soviet reach. It might take a year for Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Hungary 
to elect non-Communist governments. Imperial restoration would then require a 
World War II-style reoccupation, against the resistance of perhaps four 
legitimate democracies with wide popular support. In other words, imperial 
restoration will be inconceivable. 
</P>
<P>
Our immediate agenda, therefore, is to help Gorbachev buy time. Help him resist 
the internal discontent that comes from empty shelves and rising inflation. If 
that requires Western credits or emergency food aid, or some GATT-like 
political concession to placate the Politburo, the price is cheap. 
</P>
<P>
Now is not the time to push Gorbachev on Baltic independence, on the formal 
dismantling of the Warsaw Pact, on German reunification, on economic reforms, 
or even on Central American mischief-making. Our supreme interest is an 
independent East Europe -- and that means the continued survival of Gorbachev 
and his reforms. Everything else is secondary and, if it poses any threat to 
perestroika, counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle complains that Gorbachev's top national-security 
advisers are still hard-line. He misses the point. We are far beyond caring 
about intentions. Events have outrun intentions. 
</P>
<P>
No doubt, Gorbachev intends to make the Soviet Union a stronger, more 
efficient, more formidable power, something that is not particularly in our 
interest. But his actions have set in train forces that defy his control and 
undermine his intentions. Gorbachev could hardly have intended to give up half 
of Europe in six months. But it will soon be gone. 
</P>
<P>
Why is Eastern Europe so central? Not only because without it the Soviet empire 
becomes a shell. But because de-communization in Eastern Europe is the surest 
road to the de-communization of Russia. Until a few months ago, reform in 
Moscow was pushing reform in Eastern Europe. The process is now reversed. 
Soviet reformers, seeing East Europe's liberation, are inspired to demand the 
same at home. 
</P>
<P>
In Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia, the Communist Party has 
been stripped of its leading role. Gorbachev still hangs on to it. Last month, 
however, a motion in the Supreme Soviet to reconsider the party's leading role 
lost by only three votes (in a chamber of 542). Moreover, last week in the 
newspaper Pravda, Gorbachev himself defended the leading role of the party as 
necessary "at the present complex stage," a remarkably telling qualification. 
Given Gorbachev's history, in which today's qualification becomes tomorrow's 
new principle, it is conceivable that some sort of political pluralism is next. 
</P>
<P>
Give the man time. Gorbachev represents the greatest imperial 
self-transformation since Constantine converted to Christianity. These types do 
not come along too often. To the extent that we can help Gorbachev, it is crazy 
not to.

GETTING PROP. 103 ON THE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than a year ago California voters approved Proposition 103, hoping to 
reduce skyrocketing auto insurance rates. They have yet to see a difference in 
their bills, but now they have a glimmer of hope. The controversial initiative 
will finally take effect under new rules announced last week by Insurance 
Commissioner Roxani Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Proposition 103's rocky first year: For various reasons implementing 
it was delayed, whether out of legal considerations or political ones. 
Immediately after it passed, the insurance industry challenged the initiative 
in court. Then in May the state Supreme Court addressed the question of whether 
Proposition 103 was constitutional: Yes, it is, as long insurance companies can 
still get a "fair rate of return" on their business. 
</P>
<P>
Other delays were more problematic. Gillespie insisted that she needed detailed 
hearings and studies to define a fair rate of return before she could put the 
complex initiative to work. With more than 700 companies licensed to sell auto 
insurance in California, this process dragged on too long for the taste of most 
consumers. This made Gillespie pretty unpopular and accounts for her recent 
decision to not seek another term in her post when the insurance commissioner's 
job becomes elective next year. But at least Gillespie can put Proposition 103 
to work without worrying about political consequences. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, her new regulations governing the setting of automobile rates 
just may work for consumers, at least for big-city motorists with good driving 
records. Gillespie ordered the elimination of territorial redlining, a system 
that sets rates according to where a driver lives. Insurance companies still 
can use territory-related factors, such as population density and the number of 
accidents that occur in a given area, but only if they can statistically 
justify those factors. And no such factor can be given more weight in setting 
auto rates than an individual motorist's driving and safety record, as 
Proposition 103 stipulates. Analysts have warned that insurers will compensate 
for lower rates in big cities like Los Angeles by charging higher rates for all 
drivers, even good ones, in rural areas and smaller cities like Fresno. To 
prevent that, Gillespie has also ordered insurers to not raise their good 
drivers' rates higher than the annual increase in the Consumer Price Index. 
</P>
<P>
So it appears that Gillespie, a former insurance executive who has been 
criticized for favoring the industry, is now tilting towards the consumer. Her 
new rules may not result in the 20% rate rollback mandated in Proposition 103. 
Each insurance company's rates will be lowered, or raised, depending on what 
its fair rate of return is. But even if the initiative proves not to be the 
panacea it was billed to be, it is still a step towards creating a regulatory 
structure in California that can keep insurance rates under control. 
</P>
<P>
Some insurance companies are likely to challenge Gillespie's new regulations in 
court and that is their right. But the industry must not forget that the reason 
Proposition 103 passed, despite the expensive political campaign waged against 
it, was that consumers are desperate to see auto insurance rates cut. In some 
inner-city areas, according to one recent study, a family could pay more in one 
year for automobile insurance than for food. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than continuing to pick nits in Proposition 103, the industry would be 
better advised to join Gillespie and the consumer groups that have been 
cooperating with the Department of Insurance to plan and implement the 
additional steps that must still be taken to improve California's auto 
insurance system. They include a no-fault law like New York's, a better vehicle 
registration system that would require motorists to prove they have auto 
insurance before they can register a car and a no-frills auto liability policy 
that even poor drivers could afford. Proposition 103 is on its way, but the 
road toward full reform is still a long one.

IS WASHINGTON A FRIEND OR FOE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took years of official neglect for Colombia's cocaine producers to acquire 
the power to kill, maim and terrorize their countrymen into tolerating their 
deadly trade. It took the same brand of neglect to allow Americans to acquire a 
craving for the drug broad enough and strong enough to turn producers into 
billionaires. 
</P>
<P>
Now, perhaps too late, many Colombians are putting their lives on the line to 
help Americans break their habit -- the hard way, by choking off supply. But 
Washington has not done nearly enough to show its gratitude the only way that 
would count -- by putting more of its energy on the line trying to slow down 
both supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
Official Colombia is at war with its cocaine kingpins, who are turning the 
country into a land of open wounds. By one count, assassins working for the 
cartels are killing judges, policemen and innocent citizens at the rate of 60 a 
week. Since August alone, cartel shock troops have exploded 200 bombs. 
Wednesday's bombing tore the face off a 12-story building housing Colombia's 
equivalent of the FBI, killed more than 60 bystanders and injured 400. Cartel 
henchmen are suspected of putting a bomb aboard a Colombian airliner that 
exploded in the air last month, killing 111 passengers and crew. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has committed few resources to helping the Latin American 
centers of the cocaine trade attack supplies at the source. There seems to be 
no urgency in delivering even the most meager amounts. Last September, 
President Bush promised $261 million to Bolivia and Peru, the two largest 
growers of the coca leaf that is used to produce cocaine, to help them suppress 
the coca trade. But the money is still stuck in the congressional pipeline with 
no hope that it can be delivered before spring. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, too, that Washington cautionsly handles the question of why it can't 
do more to disrupt the large export traffic in American chemicals to Colombia 
where they are used to turn coca leaves into cocaine. It seems clear, as Times 
writer Doug Jehl reported this week, that the major suppliers of chemicals used 
in processing cocaine are from the U.S. The reply of U.S. chemical 
manufacturers? They warn that if their products don't get through, Colombia 
will buy them from competing European suppliers. True enough, perhaps, but it's 
just that sort of response that makes Latin Americans wonder about the 
sincerity of the American commitment to fight drugs.

FREEWAY PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On behalf of the District 7 office of Caltrans and, in particular our field 
personnel assigned to the Ventura Freeway rehabilitation project, I want to 
express our sincere thanks to Rick Schutt of Camarillo for his letter "Ventura 
Freeway," Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
As regular users of Route 101 probably realize, before a shovel was lifted to 
begin work last year, a lot of pre-planning went into our effort to keep 
motorists moving while construction was in progress. 
</P>
<P>
We accomplished that goal through our eight-point traffic management plan which 
was a first-ever for Caltrans and the state of California. 
</P>
<P>
One of the key elements of that plan concerned providing a frontage road for 
those traveling eastbound on Route 101 from the Conejo Valley to Warner Center. 
This road -- which connected with Ventura Boulevard -- allowed thousands of 
motorists to bypass the construction zone on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Another area where motorists helped make our job easier was through the 
voluntary use of van/car-pools which also reduced congestion. I know many 
commuters thought they would be caught in a waking "nightmare" while 
construction was under way. Instead -- the opposite occurred. Not only did 
traffic move through the work site, but motorists were able to experience more 
free-flow as compared to pre-construction weekday, stop-and-go driving. 
</P>
<P>
The success of Phase I has been very gratifying for us. I know we have the 
community and elected officials to thank and many others -- their cooperation 
made our success possible. 
</P>
<P>
After the first of January, Phase II will get under way to add a lane in each 
direction of Route 101 from Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood to Wilbur 
Avenue in Tarzana. This $40-million 15-mile project will also include bridge 
work and asphalt concrete paving.

CHARLES ROTHENBERG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a disgrace for the state of California that a criminal such as Charles 
Rothenberg is to be loosed shortly onto our streets, with no more incarceration 
than that meted out for lesser crimes. 
</P>
<P>
His crime was as heinous as premeditated murder, even worse. He condemned his 
young son, David, to unspeakable agony in an unsuccessful attempt to kill him 
by burning him alive. He had torture, murder and twisted hatred in his heart. 
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg was and is an obsessed, homicidal maniac. 
</P>
<P>
The state of California, the governor, the Board of Prison Terms and the 
Legislature, must bear full responsibility for any criminal depradations 
Rothenberg commits in the future. The people of this state, as well as the 
nation, will be watching in horror. 
</P>
<P>
How can any civilized nation or government release such a man on society -- and 
on David and his family? 
</P>
<P>
Merely saying that the state law under which Rothenberg got off with a slap on 
the wrist has been changed, is just not enough. More should be done to prevent 
his release from prison.

ONE PARTY, FEWER CHOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Democratic Party officials in Orange County are fond of saying that there are 
more Democrats here than in many states, and that enrollment is fourth-highest 
among all California counties. But that's a pretty hollow boast, somewhat akin 
to the San Francisco Giants bragging about how many runs they scored against 
the Oakland Athletics in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows which party is the winner in this county; and it is not Franklin 
D. Roosevelt's but Ronald Reagan's. Registered Republicans outnumber Democrats 
by nearly 200,000. They have locked up every congressional and county board 
seat and all but one legislative district -- and that one is mostly in Los 
Angeles County. Given the current demographics, it is unlikely that things are 
going to change soon for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
This might not matter except that there is a long tradition in this nation of a 
two-party system that leaders of both parties say stimulates healthy 
competition. While non-election years are usually quiet on the political front, 
Democrats in Orange County have lapsed to such a low ebb that the party is 
having trouble keeping an organized party structure afloat. Recently, the 
party's executive director quit because there wasn't money enough to pay him. 
</P>
<P>
Local Democratic leaders are downplaying the party's inertia. They say when 
there's an election, and candidates to work for, things will turn around. But, 
unless they get organized, there is likely to be little fund-raising apparatus 
in place to support candidates in the next election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
That means fewer choices and less discussion of important policy issues for all 
voters, no matter what their party affiliation.

DELAYS IN AIRPORT CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re coverage of terminal construction at John Wayne Airport (Dec. 2): I am flat 
out baffled by The Times' cursory coverage of the delays and cost overruns 
associated with the construction of the new terminal at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Without fail, story after story plunges into an oversimplified pasting of the 
alleged ineptitudes of the consultants, architects and construction 
professionals the county retained to plan, design and construct the terminal. 
That's not to say that these groups have not made errors over the course of the 
project, or that those errors should not be reported to county taxpayers who 
are paying for the building. Quite the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
But why do you continue to focus on the outrage of the county supervisors and 
those officials administering the job? Why do you play lap dog to their threats 
of investigation and levying of fines against consultants? Is it merely because 
it makes for good copy? 
</P>
<P>
Has no one at The Times asked how the county's inexperience with such a complex 
public works project (the largest in the county's history) contributed to the 
budget busting and delays? Has no one at The Times pondered how that 
inexperience might have contributed to the county's failure to make timely 
decisions during critical phases of the development schedule? Or how that 
failure contributed to delays and excesses of budget? 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, why no analysis of the terminal's delays and cost overruns in 
relation to other public works projects of similar magnitude? Did anyone stop 
to think that the extent of such "problems" associated with such jobs might be 
the historical norm? 
</P>
<P>
The point is this. If The Times wants to get its dander up about what a 
"fiasco" the construction of the terminal has been, do it on the editorial 
page. But when it comes to covering the project as a story, do us all a favor 
and take a look at the people who "doth protest too much" as well. You may find 
that some of their own actions are the subject of their scorn . . . and 
embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, let's all give thanks that the opening date for the terminal 
has been pushed to September, 1990. I'd much rather be inside a terminal that 
is the product of non-hurried, well-executed construction standards than an 
unreasonably ambitious schedule framed by a public relations agenda and a

COMPETITORS CAN JOIN TOGETHER WHEN FINDING A SOLUTION IS A PRIORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALISON KLAKOVICH, Alison Klakovich is the director of Rainbows to End Hunger 
in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The holidays are a traditional time of giving, not only to our friends and 
family but to those we consider less fortunate than we. We receive the usual 
requests to help the hungry and homeless during this time of celebration, and 
we respond with our predictable annual generosity. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this holiday pattern reinforces the thinking that we can make 
occasional gestures of good will and support but cannot have a real, lasting 
impact in the lives of the estimated 350,000 hungry men, women and children in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Through an unprecedented collaborative effort by ABC, NBC, CBS and the End 
Hunger Network, we all have an unusual and timely opportunity this holiday 
season. 
</P>
<P>
While all of us abhor hunger and homelessness in our affluent county, very few 
of us recognize the critical difference our own individual action will make. 
That is the focus of the seven prime time network television shows 
participating in "Prime Time to End Hunger." This extraordinary project which 
starts Monday involves seven of the top prime time programs: "Designing Women," 
"thirtysomething," "Head of the Class," "Jake and the Fatman," "The Cosby 
Show," "Cheers" and "Golden Girls." The episodes during this week will be about 
hunger, homelessness, poverty, and illiteracy, with the emphasis being on the 
impact of volunteerism on these local, national and global problems. 
</P>
<P>
The very existence of this partnership between such fierce competitors as the 
three television networks is a demonstration of a new mood in our nation. It is 
becoming a priority to do something that will make a difference in and for our 
communities. Hopefully viewers will share this commitment as Prime Time goes 
beyond entertainment and education in our daily lives and asks that we act. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of each program viewers can call a 900 number announced by the 
show's celebrities. Orange County respondents will receive an Ending Hunger 
Handbook, customized with volunteer opportunities at local organizations. This 
is made possible by another unimaginable partnership between AT&amp;T, MCI and 
Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
The triads of network television stations and telecommunications companies are 
examples of the unpredictable alliances that occur when solving a complex 
problem becomes a priority. Our history books are filled with other examples of 
the leadership, creativity, unexpected support and accomplishment that is 
called forth by a priority being created. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally and globally public opinion is on the move; ending world hunger is 
becoming a priority. President Bush, on Oct. 25, held a press conference to 
encourage Americans to watch the Prime Time to End Hunger shows on television 
this holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
No one is fooled into believing that ending hunger, globally or just here in 
Orange County, will be simple or easy. Hunger is a complex issue that can be 
discussed in terms of a variety of "ologies", "ics" and "isms": sociology, 
psychology, ecology, politics, economics, racism, communism and socialism. 
Hunger has plagued mankind for as long as we have been organized as 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
But it is possible to end it. How? Not by feeding people endlessly at soup 
kitchens or in famine camps. To end it sustainably, we must provide hungry 
people with the opportunities they need to end their own hunger. If any 
community has the resources to provide the opportunities hungry people need, we 
do. It is only for the lack of a priority that 17% of our neighbors struggle 
for adequate nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
Is the problem of hunger complex? Undoubtedly. Is the solution to hunger 
complicated? Without question hungry people need a wide variety of 
opportunities to end their hunger, some more difficult to provide than others. 
This is why hunger will be ended only when we have made it our priority, and 
express that priority with our time as well as our money. What better time to 
do that than on the eve of the last decade of the 20th Century?

ONE WOMAN'S CHOICE -- PREGNANCY SERVES AS TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have a hunch that Dianne Klein's article ("One Woman's Choice: Pregnancy as a 
Test of Faith," Nov. 19) may have generated a fair amount of "hate-type" mail 
from pro-life, anti-abortion advocates. And I also have a hunch that her 
article in today's (Dec. 3) Times may generate a fair amount of "hate-type" 
mail from pro-choice, pro-abortion advocates. I hope that I am wrong. I fear 
that I am right. 
</P>
<P>
I am writing to thank her for writing both articles. I was deeply touched by 
her article in today's paper; I found it compelling, moving and helpful in my 
own pastoral work. But I recognize that there is more of the story to tell. On 
Nov. 7, the Catholic Bishops of the United States issued a resolution on 
abortion that contains these words: "We recognize, as we rightfully engage in 
this debate, that we must hear the issues, the struggles and the anguish of 
women who face issues in a way that we never will." I thank you for assisting 
all in this effort to listen.

O'NEILL PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without fanfare, quietly, the County Board of Supervisors is considering a 
proposal to turn O'Neill Regional Park into a Rancho Santa Margarita Country 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
The park is a quiet respite from ever increasing urbanization. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in addition to being threatened by encroaching housing tracts, the 
wilderness park is threatened by proposals to add tennis courts, swimming 
pools, playing fields, paved motorcycle trails and an amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
This would destroy the rural character and wildlife habitats of O"Neill Park 
and turn it into just another urban playground. Let's keep O"Neill Park 
natural!

'INS RAID ON SITE SCUTTLES BUDDING TRUST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I did not realize that there was a Republic of Laguna Beach until reading the 
article in the Orange County section (Nov. 30) titled "Raid at Dayworker Site 
Angers Officials." On first reading, I was amused by the contradiction of a 
police department which encourages lawbreaking. When one aids or abets others 
to violate the laws of the United States, it is generally viewed as a crime. 
</P>
<P>
However, since Laguna Beach apparently does not recognize the authority of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service or federal law, then one must recognize 
the emergence of an independent Republic of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
On reflection I have begun to view this attitude of disregard for laws as a 
symptom of a deteriorating society. I am sure that I am not alone when I say 
that I see countless examples of petty lawlessness being committed every day. 
</P>
<P>
Sociologists will suggest that this petty lawlessness is based in part upon our 
perceptions of our leaders and government. If Laguna Beach can so easily bypass 
federal laws because of local self-interest, then why should the ordinary 
citizen be any less self-interested? It makes one wonder whether the ordinary 
Laguna Beach police officer has to rationalize, the giving of a traffic ticket 
on the one hand while on the other hand he directs illegal aliens to a hiring 
location so that the people of Laguna Beach can hire undocumented aliens. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is not whether one does or does not like the federal immigration 
laws, but rather the effect on our society from an apparent blatant disregard 
of our laws.

'DEMOCRATS FIND NO LIFE IN THE PARTY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "Orange County Democrats Find No Life in the Party" (Nov. 26): Even without 
money, there is more life in the Orange County Democratic Party than the 
Republicans can buy. Next time visit one of our Central Committee meetings or 
other events to see just how much life we do have before you write such an 
inaccurate headline. 
</P>
<P>
Your reporter who wrote the story visited our last Central Committee meeting 
and told me that he thought the meeting was exciting. It's too bad the Los 
Angeles Times decided to focus on the negative.

ACCUSED DOCTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Being a partner in a law firm that specializes in representing patients in 
medical malpractice actions, I read with interest the article on the doctors 
facing possible disciplinary action. Of particular note was the statement by 
Dr. Hansel D. Benvenuti that he has never had even a single malpractice suit 
and that he was trying to protect his "good name." 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, I personally tried a case for a patient against Dr. Benvenuti, wherein 
a jury found he was negligent in her care and supervision during her 
hospitalization at Hoag Memorial. Rather substantial money damages were 
assessed against him and others. The verdict was upheld on appeal.

BAY CLUB'S BID TO EXTEND ITS LEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because of the finances involved to Newport Beach, the Balboa Bay Club lease 
extension deserves more public debate and a vote of the people of Newport 
Beach. The people of Newport Beach could lose lots of money if the 50-year 
lease extension is granted by the Newport Beach City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The existing lease for the Balboa Bay Club property is due to expire in the 
year 2011, at which time the improvements and buildings on this property are 
due to revert to the city of Newport Beach, including the 145-unit apartment 
building, hotel accommodations and clubhouse facilities. The income from these 
improvements would then go totally to the city of Newport Beach, less any 
management costs involved. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if the new 50-year lease is granted, the improvements and 
buildings on the land won't revert to the city until the year 2039, if even 
then, if a future City Council extends the lease again. The city would forever 
receive only a small portion, rather than getting the lion's share of the 
income produced by the property. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, this is why the Balboa Bay Club is so desperate to avoid a vote of 
the people. It wants the income from the property. 
</P>
<P>
Finance is just one of the issues. The other issues, such as the tidelands 
public trust and the ultimate disposition (even removal) of the "Great Wall of 
China" apartment building on the property, lend even greater credence to a 
public vote on the Balboa Bay Club lease. After all, if the Iron Curtain and 
the Berlin Wall can come down in Europe today, the Great Wall of China can come 
down in Newport Beach some day, the sooner the better.

ONE WOMAN'S CHOICE -- PREGNANCY SERVES AS TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing about pro-choice and all these women who 
are for abortion. Today's article (Dec. 3) by Dianne Klein was such a warm, 
touching, positive story, it left me with tears on my cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
Thank God this lady had the courage and faith in Jesus to keep this child, 
knowing that the odds of abnormality were high. 
</P>
<P>
Thank God she went by the hospital to visit the baby and felt that tugging in 
her heart to take her baby home instead of put him up for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
Thank God the father was a mature, kind and loving man to marry this woman and 
to care for this child when it would have been easier to run the other way. 
</P>
<P>
Thank God this mother was brave enough to share her story that will make a 
difference in this world. 
</P>
<P>
Thank God there are people who value life even when it starts at conception.

JAY DAULEY, FOUNDER OF LA MIRADA SWAP MEET, DIES AT 66 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jay Dauley, founder of the La Mirada Drive-In Theater Swap Meet and a number of 
other flea markets, died of heart failure Nov. 21 at his home in San Antonio, 
Tex. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Fort Worth, Dauley moved his wife and six children to California in the

had a string of flea market operations in California and five other states. 
</P>
<P>
He moved to La Mirada in 1964, the year he opened that swap meet, which became 
the largest weekend swap meet in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Dauley is survived by his wife Joanne, four sons, a daughter, two brothers, 14 
grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren.

HUGGING AN IMAGINARY COAST EAST COAST/WEST COAST BY PATRICK DOUGLAS (DONALD I. 
FINE: $18.95; 418 PP.; 1-55611-098-7) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Rieff, Rieff is a free-lance writer based in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Eureka," his jubilant essay on living in Los Angeles, John Gregory Dunne 
pointed out, not without a certain handsome relish, that people in Los Angeles 
no longer cared all that much about what was going on back East. Not only had 
their inferiority complex vanished entirely, but so, becomingly, had their 
hostility. Whatever people in New York might choose to suppose, no one in Los 
Angeles took seriously the idea, which, in any case, might as well have come 
straight out of a B-Western, that America wasn't big enough for both cities to 
coexist in, much less that California's own success required as its vindictive 
corollary the economic or cultural collapse of the Boston-to-Washington 
corridor. "There it was," Dunne wrote, "the canker, the painful sore of 
reciprocity: Los Angeles was indifferent to New York." 
</P>
<P>
Dunne was writing in 1978, when it already seemed safe to assume, in California 
any way, that all that tired oppositional thinking would soon be put to rest. 
The East Coast and the West Coast had never been two states of consciousness in 
the first place, but rather, as if that weren't enough, two very different 
areas of the country with all the distinctions as well, of course, as the 
commonalities, that places 3,000 miles apart with different histories and 
different economic interests can be expected to have. Unfortunately, it seems 
that old cliches, like old resentments, die hard. 
</P>
<P>
In "East Coast/West Coast," Patrick Douglas, a free-lance writer from South 
Carolina, now transplanted to San Francisco, has given them their fullest and 
most tendentious airing since Woody Allen indulged his New York prejudices on 
the subject in all their venomous ignorance in his fim, "Annie Hall." Douglas, 
of course, comes down firmly on the side of California in this pointless 
contest, but in his vulgarity and simple-mindedness he very much resembles 
Allen or any of the countless New York pseudo-wits who have had so much fun 
trashing California. 
</P>
<P>
In Douglas' recapitulation, the East Coast is home of rationality, elitism, and 
old-fashioned Eurocentrism. "Being older," Douglas writes in his breathy, 
portentious way, "the East Coast shares Europe's sense of history, of human 
frailty and human folly." In contrast, Californians are -- predictably, since 
the stereotype hasn't changed since at least the nineteen-twenties -- imbued 
with a receptiveness to the new, a belief in the boundlessness of possibility 
and the inherent benignity of change, and an affinity for the intuitive and for 
the mystical. It is surely no accident that Douglas locates the center of this 
new way of thinking in the northern rather than the southern part of the state, 
for his is a view of California that might conceivably make sense at an Esalen 
weekend but has little to do with a morning on the floor of the Pacific Stock 
Exchange, let alone on any sweatshop floor along Los Angeles Street in the 
garment center. 
</P>
<P>
Even Douglas' description of life in California is peculiar in the extreme. At 
one point, he contrasts life on the East and West Coasts and observes that West 
Coast residents are "like a leisure class that, free from the business of 
earning a living, is inclined to wonder what it all means." Elsewhere, Douglas 
asserts that on the East Coast, "a person's life is often largely predetermined 
-- by social class, education, custom and so on. On the West Coast, there are 
few such constraints. How should a person spend his life? is a question that 
inevitably arises." Tell that to a high school kid in Compton, or, for that 
matter, a clerical worker in the Valley. Douglas is so infatuated with his 
generalizations that he never pauses to ask himself whether they apply or not 
to real Californians as well as to the idea of California that he entertains so 
mechanically. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with an essentially metaphoric description of reality of the type 
that Douglas offers is that it so easily drives thinking into abstraction and 
pointless speculation. Had Douglas been content to look at the degree to which 
California's coming of age is changing American politics and American culture, 
he might have written a useful if scarcely an original book. After all, that 
theme has been treated well by a number of recent books, notably Joel Kotkin 
and Yoriko Kishimoto's "The Third Century," as well as regularly in such 
important magazines as the Los Angeles-based New Perspectives Quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas is after bigger game. He genuinely believes that California represents 
a new stage of human consciousness, and, imprisoned in his metaphor, he goes so 
far as to argue that the difference between the East and West Coasts is 
analogous to the right brain/left brain dichotomy in neurology. Here, "East 
Coast/West Coast" goes off the rails entirely, but even before Douglas has run 
his book aground on the shoals of parapsychology, it is clear that he is more 
interested in what might be true, or what he would like to be true, than in 
what he can describe. 
</P>
<P>
California deserves better. There is a real transformation of American culture 
going on all around us; and if Los Angeles has not necessarily supplanted New 
York, it has become one of the great capital cities of our increasingly 
polycentric world. Those are the questions that are worth pondering. That is 
the California that needs to be confronted by writers and thinkers. What we do 
not need is the kind of potted history and mystical gobbledygook so perfectly 
exemplified by "East Coast/West Coast."

REFRACTIONS OF THE DYING LIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
KING OF THE ROAD BY PAUL HEMPHILL (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $18.95; 296 PP.; 
0-395-49860-0) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Winston Groom, Groom is at work on his seventh novel, The Valley of Tears, 
which will be published by Atlantic Monthly Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Hemphill sets the tone of this sentimental but endearing story by having 
his foil, the 40-ish son of the book's main character, reading the familiar 
Dylan Thomas poem, "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night," to a class of 
stupos in his last teaching day at an obscure junior college in the Florida 
Panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
The verse, "Rage, rage against the dying of the light . . .", is, of course, 
meant to prepare the reader for what's next, which is the son's return home to 
see his aging father who is currently incarcerated in a fundamentalist 
alcoholism-rehabilitation facility after being expelled from the retirement 
center where he and his wife have been living since she came down with 
Alzheimer's. 
</P>
<P>
Sonny Hawkins finds his father Jake practically terrorizing the 
alcohol-treatment facility -- gambling with the patients, playing loud music, 
disrupting activities and finally making good with his threat to run away. Now, 
old Jake is a "character," as the saying goes -- profane, joke-cracking, 
cigar-smoking and bourbon-drinking, an ex-trucker who has been stewing in his 
juices since he gave up the road several years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing Jake does when he gets back to the old family home in a rundown 
blue-collar section of Birmingham is start drinking whiskey again and 
reminiscing with Sonny about brighter days. Sonny, a recovering alcoholic 
himself, accepts all this bluster and braggadocio as stoically as he can until 
Jake starts talking about going back on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Out behind the house is Jake's old truck, the Dixie Redball IV, idle for years 
until Jake begins to tinker with it again. It isn't long before the Redball is 
spit-and-polished and ready to roll. Jake persuades an old acquaintance, a tire 
dealer he's served for years hauling retreads, to let him make one last haul. 
Sonny, naturally, is appalled at the idea of a 70-year-old drunk getting behind 
the wheel, but Jake manages to persuade his old boss to let him deliver a load 
of tires out to Nevada and then pick up another load of recaps for the trip 
home. It's not that Jake is just a simple trucker, he's also an expert in the 
bidding and buying of tires he hauls. 
</P>
<P>
Well, nothing will do except that Sonny must accompany Jake on this "last 
roundup," as it were, and the pair of them -- sad, middle age failure Sonny and 
crazy, twilight-yeared, irascible Jake -- set out on a 5,000-mile cross-country 
adventure. 
</P>
<P>
You can't help but like old Jake. He might be a stubborn, opinionated racist 
but he also can be tender and understanding, and able to enjoy the company of 
blacks. He always finds ingenious ways to avoid the roadside truck scales and 
fleeces gouging motel owners who are trying to fleece him. At an age when Sonny 
ought to be "fathering" Jake, it is just the other way around. Sonny marvels at 
his father's stamina and courage at a time when his own is faltering. 
</P>
<P>
This father-and-son odyssey takes Jake and Sonny on back roads Jake never needs 
a map for, and to nostalgic old haunts decaying amid modern progress. In one 
touching episode, Jake pulls off at an ancient truck stop he always used to 
stay in, only to find it shut down and empty, victim of a new interstate 
highway nearby. 
</P>
<P>
But in a small dwelling behind the place, Jake finds Minnie, wife of the owner 
-- who has since died -- and she reopens the restaurant one last time, just for 
them, serving a dinner of "chicken-fried steak, mashed potatoes and sawmill 
gravy, and biscuits." By the end of the evening, Jake and Minnie are dancing to 
Country tunes played on an old Wurlitzer. "While the fiddles played, Minnie 
took Jake by the hand and led him to the jukebox. She in her denim skirt, he in 
cowboy boots and polyester slacks of hideous green, they held each other close 
and danced. Across the road, the new moon and the stars high in the Kansas sky 
glistened on the lazy Arkansas River. On the road itself, the loneliest road in 
America, big rigs thundered into the night, rattling the windows as they 
passed." 
</P>
<P>
More than anything, this novel is a labor of love, of the admiration of a son 
for his father, which is probably not such a common thing these days, if it 
ever was. Hemphill obviously knows what he's talking about when it comes to 
trucks and trucking, and the dedication for the book cites his father as "the 
last trucker." But the story also fulfills its original premise -- that of the 
Dylan Thomas poem -- and it is uplifting to see the triumph of old Jake 
Hawkins, raging successfully against "the dying of the light." 
</P>
<P>
Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of 
day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dylan Thomas, 1952.

"If I need be -- if I really have to -- I shall invent a life for myself from 
minute to minute and believe in it." Dutch author J. Bernlef tests the 
boundaries of reality in "Out of Mind," an almost microscopical examination of 
senility. 
</P>
<P>
Maarten Klein, a retired Dutch consultant for fisheries, is losing control of 
his mind and body. His illness takes him into a swift descent that begins with 
ordinary moments of forgetfulness -- the time of day, someone's name, a 
misplaced item -- and spirals him into the ultimate terror where he cannot 
trust his perceptions any longer and is left spinning in a whirlpool of 
fragmented images. 
</P>
<P>
He tries to fight his disorientation by seeing it as normal for his age, tries 
to link it to childhood experiences of waking up when "the walls of your room 
were all wrong around you. In your mind you had to swivel the room around . . 
." Though his link to his world has been severed, he survives on internal 
monologues that are fed by surprisingly rich images. 
</P>
<P>
In his effective choice of Maarten's first-person, present-tense perspective, 
Bernlef forces his readers to participate in Maarten's terrifying journey 
through an unfamiliar landscape. Maarten's bewilderment mirrors the confusion 
he felt when he and his wife, Vera, first arrived in Gloucester, Mass. Like all 
immigrants, they were confronted by the different language, the unknown region, 
and they adapted though they always considered the Netherlands their home and 
continued to speak Dutch when alone. But in this internal terrain of chaos, any 
adaptation is deceptive: Moments shift, rules change and language ultimately 
fails. "I seem to lose words like another person loses blood." 
</P>
<P>
Maarten also loses his connection to music, which always has been significant 
to him. In the early stages of his illness, music remained accessible to him. 
"I place my fingers in a chord on the keys, and suddenly I begin to play." But 
soon, the notes "won't come off the page and into my fingers." 
</P>
<P>
Maarten's relationship to his wife, Vera, has been strong and caring throughout 
their 50-year marriage. "I am the only person who can see in her all the women 
she has been. Sometimes I touch her, and then I touch all of them at once, very 
gently." But as his disorder progresses, he begins to confuse her with his 
mother, even his grandmother. He doesn't know where to place this old woman who 
looks at him with worried eyes. Images of his first lover are far more vivid 
than memories of his life with Vera. 
</P>
<P>
As Maarten weaves between different levels of reality, he tries to make sense 
of the actions that compromise him: getting dressed in the middle of the night, 
losing the dog during a walk, eating to the point of nausea, breaking a window. 
He struggles against the "feeling of being absent while being fully conscious, 
of being lost, of losing your way." 
</P>
<P>
As the structure of his memory erodes, he finds it increasingly difficult to 
make connections. Incidents stand by themselves, isolated from experience, 
causing him to distrust his perceptions. He compares himself to a camera that 
"makes no distinction between important and unimportant, foreground and 
background." The major clues to this chaos, which he can't name or escape from, 
are Vera's reactions -- grief, anger, pain. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, Bernlef lets Maarten overhear Vera's comments about his disease, 
offering an opinion that lies outside his twisted awareness, a device that 
feels contrived to feed the reader information. Maarten's deterioration emerges 
far more effectively through his awareness. 
</P>
<P>
When he loses control of his bowels, he feels betrayed by his body. This sense 
of humiliation causes a dramatic change in his condition -- he disappears to 
himself until he can't even see his face in the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
At times, "Out of Mind" is too close to a case study. What saves it from the 
clinical depiction of senility is Maarten's spirited fight against oblivion and 
the change in his voice that grows more lyrical as his disorientation deepens. 
Transitions between the different layers of his reality become more abrupt; 
sometimes his thoughts rush; other times they stop "rigid as a magic-lantern 
picture." The anxiety that has been a major reaction to his illness diminishes 
as his awareness centers on sensuous details: the scent of flowers, flecks of 
light, sounds of singing. 
</P>
<P>
Bernlef, the author of more than 50 books of fiction, poetry, nonfiction and 
drama, has written a dark book about irreversible loss -- loss of self, of 
language, of relationships, of memories. Although the voice at the end of the 
novel suggests hope, the situation is bleak: Maarten is removed from his home 
and taken to a hospital where he lies nearly incoherent, "hidden from the eye 
of the world." 
</P>
<P>
"Out of Mind" is Bernlef's first novel to be translated into English.

MERYL STREEP'S LATEST ACCENT IS A LAUGH; 
</P>
<P>
IN 'SHE-DEVIL,' AMERICA'S MOST SERIOUS ACTRESS GETS SERIOUS ABOUT COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Take notice, Pauline Kael and like-minded film critics who complain that Meryl 
Streep needs to "giggle more and suffer less": Streep is giggling. It happens 
every time the actress mentions Mary Fisher, the man-hungry romance novelist 
she portrays in the just-released comedy "She-Devil": Her voice gets breathy, 
her face turns flirtatiously upward and then, without warning, she erupts into 
giggles. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see it?," she asks, when the talk during a recent interview turns to 
tabloid reports about her relations with "She-Devil" co-star Roseanne Barr. 
"They put my head on Oprah Winfrey's body," she says, sitting back on her hotel 
room couch, letting the image sink in before breaking into peals of laughter. 
Maybe Streep has been suffering on-screen too long. She has the timing of a 
born comedian. 
</P>
<P>
As the very blond, very coiffed Fisher, Streep has at last gone comic, even 
campy. She sweeps onto the screen in meticulous, lavishly pink designer garb, a 
biting caricature of today's aerobicized, plasticized, anesthesized woman. 
</P>
<P>
Portraying Fisher in a comic fairy tale about ugly-duckling revenge is only the 
beginning of the surprises in store from this 40-year-old, two-time Academy 
Award winner, the most respected actress of her generation. In next summer's 
"Postcards from the Edge," based on actress Carrie Fisher's comedic book, 
Streep plays the wise-cracking, drug-addicted actress and daughter of an aging 
movie star. She also sings. Superficially, at least, she says "Postcards" 
provides the role closest to her -- how she looks, talks and acts -- of her 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Streep has moved to Santa Monica temporarily because in February, she begins 
work on "Defending Your Life," a courtroom comedy co-starring Albert Brooks, 
who will also direct. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she has dropped plans to once again play a suffering character with 
a foreign accent -- former Argentine ruler Evita Peron. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bitter disappointment," says Streep. "But it's just a movie. As 
Albert (Brooks) said, 'You know, Meryl, you could do this and it would be the 
toughest thing you've ever done in your life. It would be monumental. It would 
be fantastic. It would be huge. And everyone would say, So what?' " Streep's 
voice slips into a snide nasal tone. " 'What else is new?' 
</P>
<P>
"That's the joke about me, that I do all these really hard roles," Streep says, 
with no trace of bitterness in her voice. Her career may be short on on-screen 
punchlines, but off-screen she laughs at herself and wryly comments on the 
world around her. "I guess they're sick of me," she says of her detractors, and 
again she laughs. 
</P>
<P>
The great irony of Streep's career is that she has transformed herself, 
chameleon-like, into such a diverse range of characters that by now these 
Oscar-attracting performances seem almost routine. She insists that comments 
from critics like Kael "mean nothing." But she also suggests she feels some 
impact. "It's out there in the air, like smog," she says of the criticism. "You 
don't feel smog going into your lungs. If the day's beautiful, you don't 
notice." 
</P>
<P>
Whether her motives come from an inner drive, or are the result of the air 
quality around her, Streep -- for now at least -- is adding a new chapter to 
her career. She has turned the page on Lindy Chamberlain, the persecuted 
Australian mother in "Cry in the Dark"; on Helen, the ragged transient in 
"Ironweed"; on the death camp survivor Sophie in "Sophie's Choice"; on Baroness 
Karen Blixen in "Out of Africa"; on Joanna Kramer, the conflicted mother in 
"Kramer v. Kramer." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Fisher has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
It may be difficult to envision Mary Fisher as a role that Meryl Streep was 
born to play, but she has been preparing for it most of her life -- at least 
since the first blonde vixens crossed her path in junior high. Streep herself 
wasn't immune to the demands of the beauty machine, though she may have 
approached it with a hint more irony than her peers. The daughter of a 
commercial artist (her mother) and a pharmaceutical company executive, Streep 
the teen-ager pulled out the bottle of peroxide and put in a pair of contacts 
to transform herself into a knock-out cheerleader at her suburban New Jersey 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the role of Mary Fisher was offered two decades later, Streep was 
more than ready. "Ohhhh," she growls, "I just wanted to get it all in." She 
surprised "She-Devil" director Susan Seidelman by showing up at an early 
reading dressed for the part. 
</P>
<P>
"She came into the room as Mary Fisher, with the perfectly coiffed nails and 
her hair all bouffanted," Seidelman recalls. 
</P>
<P>
"The character could have gone a lot of ways," Streep says of Mary Fisher. "But 
I wanted to (deal with) traditional notions of beauty. I thought I was making 
fun of that. But I must say, the crew treated me real nice when I had my Mary 
outfit on, and my fingernails were all false and pasted on, and I had on all 
this sloppy jewelry, and my hair teased up and fluffed, and the makeup was on 
like lacquer. Barbie," she adds firmly, "is never going to go out of style." 
</P>
<P>
As she says this, Streep sits in a hotel room on the Westside of L.A. -- a hub 
of pre-fab beauty, where liposuction is fast becoming as popular as the 
convertible and teen-age visits to the plastic surgeon are estimated to be up 
threefold in the 1980s. It is a far cry from Streep's more frumpy life style in 
rural Connecticut, where she plays housewife to sculptor husband Don Gummer and 
cares for her three children when she's not on a distant movie set. 
</P>
<P>
But there are Mary Fishers everywhere, even in rural Connecticut. The one she 
plays in "She-Devil" lives in a pink palace on Long Island, where she spends 
one part of her time writing trashy romance novels, and two parts of her time 
remaking herself into a male fantasy of the ideal woman. The movie focuses on 
Barr's single-minded plan for revenge after the romance novelist steals her 
accountant husband, played by Ed Begley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Streep notes that the film is not only commenting on "how Mary looks. It's the 
time she spends looking like that. It's horrifying how much time we all spend 
on that. I'm not anti-pink. It's just that offering-of-the-neck version of 
feminity that I find so loathsome. It's hard for me to say this, because I'm 
sure it's important to a lot of women, but I don't like it when people design 
themselves, like when women use different voices with men (than with women)." 
</P>
<P>
Seidelman and producer Jonathan Brett couldn't help flinching when they saw 
Fisher look-alikes show up at screenings of "She-Devil." But Seidelman says she 
doesn't expect Streep's comic portrayal to offend too many women. Like the Fay 
Weldon novel on which it is based, says Seidelman, the characters in 
"She-Devil" are exaggerations of real-life figures, the story a fairy tale. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want to attack anyone," Seidelman says. "By exaggerating (the 
character) a little, maybe even these women can see themselves as victims." 
Even the beautiful Mary Fisher considers plastic surgery when the philandering 
Begley starts "working late." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not surprisingly, given her affinity for challenging parts, Streep 
first toyed with the idea of playing the homely Ruth Patchett in the film. 
Seidelman was relieved that Streep instead opted for the role of Mary Fisher. 
"Even though Roseanne is not as experienced an actor, it would have been less 
effective if a glamorous woman was frumping it up," the director says. 
</P>
<P>
Streep became intimate with her character during years of working in an 
industry that has always placed a premium on good looks, particularly for 
women. "There's no doubt that when beautiful women come on the screen, it's 
breathtaking, because the image is so huge," she says. "There's a moment in a 
woman's life that has this matchless affect in the way she appears on screen. 
It's magic for women, as well as men, to look at. And (these actresses) don't 
have to have to be able to string two words together, never mind about their 
character development or their analysis of the script. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing wrong (with Hollywood's appreciation of beauty)," Streep adds, 
"unless there are no other women in the movies." 
</P>
<P>
Despite those prominent cheekbones and an angular nose that have come to be 
appreciated as her own unique brand of beauty, Streep has demonstrated an 
eagerness to play those less-than-glamorous "other women." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to ride a polemic here," she says, "but I do like people to see 
the beauty in the soul. That's why I take certain roles like (Helen) in 
'Ironweed' and Lindy Chamberlain (in 'A Cry in the Dark')." 
</P>
<P>
The double standard for men and women in Hollywood extends beyond looks. 
Despite her many Oscar nominations and critical standing, Streep is vastly 
underpaid compared to the fees being earned by top male stars. Recent studies 
have shown that the male-female pay gap is greater in the artistic professions 
than in other sectors of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"I try (for higher salary demands) because if I undercut myself I don't do 
anybody a favor who has not achieved as much," Streep says. But, she notes, 
it's not easy. "As it is, I make half what Dustin (Hoffman) makes, half what 
(Robert) Redford makes, half what Jack (Nicholson) makes," she says. "I don't 
begrudge them what they make, because they're smart. But I do think that's 
amazing." 
</P>
<P>
Streep has starred in a handful of hit films, including "Silkwood," "Sophie's 
Choice" and "Out of Africa," but a number of her recent movies fell flat at the 
box office, including "Cry in the Dark," "Ironweed," and "Heartburn." But 
Streep says that's no excuse for the differential in salaries between her and 
someone like Nicholson, who was paid $11 million to star as the Joker in 
"Batman." 
</P>
<P>
"I was in movies with Jack ('Ironweed,' 'Heartburn') that no one came to see. 
So if he's such a fabulous draw . . . " she says, her voice trailing off. 
</P>
<P>
A salary dispute was one reason for Streep's withdrawal from "Evita" last fall, 
after preparing for the role for more than a year. Ironically, she pulled out 
when her escalating salary demands were finally met. By then, the project -- 
spearheaded by producer Robert Stigwood and to be directed by Oliver Stone -- 
had been dropped from Weintraub Entertainment Group's slate and had moved to 
Carolco. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, they were complaining that they just simply didn't have the 
money," says Streep. "I wanted to do the part so badly that I went to the altar 
(and accepted a salary cut). Then (Carolco) came in and I said I would like to 
be paid what I usually get paid and suddenly the money was there. "So," she 
adds, laughing, "I actually got insulted that the money they were saying they 
didn't have for a year and a half was suddenly available . . . I can work very, 
very hard, but not when I feel I'm being lied to, or that I mistrust the 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks after dropping out, she indicated that she might reconsider the 
decision. Now, however, with Oliver Stone also off the project, she doesn't see 
"Evita" in her future. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, she adds, the decision to drop off the project involved reasons other 
than salary. She says she felt drained by the interminable negotiations and 
difficulties in getting the big-budget picture off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"I had fallen out of love with the project," she says. "The joy had been 
stripped from it. It was like Sisyphus, pushing a boulder up a hill." Streep's 
remarks echo similar published comments made earlier by Stone. 
</P>
<P>
Though various producers have been trying to get a film version of the stage 
musical "Evita" off the ground for 10 years, Stone and Streep came onto the 
project in the spring of 1988. Streep began undertaking intensive training in 
singing and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was going to be an exciting film, the way Oliver had conceived 
it," she says. "It was very gritty. It was a story about how people transform 
themselves and design themselves -- not only into something they convince 
themselves of, but into something convincing to whole masses of people. I just 
had a good feeling about Oliver; he had put together a visually stunning 
piece." 
</P>
<P>
Original plans called for the film, with a $29 million budget, to be shot in 
Argentina. But, reacting to concerns about unrest in that country, Weintraub 
moved production planning to Spain, where the budget escalated to $35 million. 
Last summer, Weintraub -- by then a company in the midst of serious financial 
problems -- dropped the project. Streep then dropped out, followed by Stone. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her intensive preparation for the role, characters like Evita come 
fairly easily to Streep. She says she readily picks up foreign accents. " It's 
a very mechanical thing, a musical thing. My son, for example, can remember 
tunes with ease, but my daughter doesn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of the Yale School of Drama, Streep describes her training in acting 
as a patchwork of ideas and styles, and claims to know nothing about "Method" 
acting, the live-your-character course that the late Lee Strasberg taught to 
such students as Marlon Brando, James Dean and Paul Newman at the Actors Studio 
in New York. "I don't know what the Method is," she says. "I've never read the 
book and I didn't learn it in school. I have sort of a hodge-podge education -- 
which was something to complain about in drama school, but it turned out to be 
very valuable. You get a little bit of everybody's ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really prepare all that much," she adds. "It's more instinctual than 
that. It all comes down to the same thing; just locating a truth within 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Streep says she has found most of her roles exhilarating rather than 
frustrating or exhausting. Her most difficult part, she says, was in Robert 
Benton's critically panned "In the Still of the Night," a Hitchcockian thriller 
in which she co-starred with Roy Scheider. "The character was a cipher," she 
says. "All I had to do was look good, and it was impossible to look good 
because there was no inner beauty. It was all about doing her hair, getting the 
lighting right." 
</P>
<P>
Streep may turn plenty of heads in her upcoming comedic roles. But, as she 
notes, many of the parts she played in drama school -- characters created by 
playwrights like Christopher Durang -- drew plenty of laughs. "I always did 
very comical roles when I went to school," she says. "In drama school, there 
was an exhortation to make the outrageous choice. That was the credo." 
</P>
<P>
It was her face, she says, that shaped her direction on film. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a kind of serious nose, and a serious face," she says. "Early on, my 
physiognomy sort of dictated what I would be cast as in films. I've been 
looking for a script that made me laugh. I go to a lot of movies where people 
are all laughing around me and I feel like I'm from outerspace because I find 
it dangerous and stupid and horrible and degrading to women and all these 
things." 
</P>
<P>
The script for "She-Devil," she said, made her laugh. And, she adds, the 
characters had an imperative, their stories needed to be told. 
</P>
<P>
Now all she has to do is convince the Pauline Kaels of the world that Meryl 
Streep can giggle with the best of them.

<P>
Just 50 years after the signing of the Declaration of Independence, when most 
of America was still rural and raw, Greek Revival in all its formal forms 
became the favored architectural style of the nation. Everyone, it seems, 
wanted his house, store, church and city hall built with the ornamented columns 
and pilasters, pedimented gables and heavy cornices with unadorned friezes that 
distinguish the style. 
</P>
<P>
What prompted this penchant for the classical look is the focus of Roger G. 
Kennedy's Greek Revival America (Stewart Tabori &amp; Chang: $85; 464 pp.; 
1-55670-094-6). The effort glistens as the gift of choice this holiday season 
for those with an interest in architectural history. Attractively designed to 
include about 190 full-color commissioned photographs, there also is an 
annotated guide to the outstanding extant examples of the style. 
</P>
<P>
But most engaging is Kennedy's narrative exploring how the political, 
psychological, sexual and, in particular, social forces of the time prompted a 
nation to embrace a particular design -- which is described by the author more 
liberally as American Free Classicism -- and why it was eventually discarded, 
and discredited. The result is a rare architectural history that goes beyond 
simple explanations and descriptive chronologies of projects and their 
architects to posit ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Sketching architectural history also on a large canvas is Laurence G. Liu's 
Chinese Architecture (Rizzoli: $75; 298 pp.; 0-8478-1082-8). The subject, of 
course, demands such a canvas, given China's diverse geography, cultures and 
3,000-year history. Liu responds with a broad stroke when citing the influences 
of China's varied philosophies and religions, and a more precise and assured 
stroke describing specific buildings. Helping are 300 color photographs, 
numerous plans and maps, a comparative chronology of Chinese history, and a 
glossary of Chinese terms. 
</P>
<P>
The Art and Architecture of English Gardens by Jane Brown (Rizzoli: $85; 320 
pp.; 0-8478-1089-5) celebrates four centuries of love by the British of their 
gardens, be they in a royal expanse, a rambling country estate, a public park, 
a London back yard, a few square feet in front of a row house or beyond a 
kitchen door, or in a glass-walled conservatory. 
</P>
<P>
In a different focus and scale is Steps &amp; Stairways by Cleo Baldon and Ib 
Melchoir (Rizzoli: $45; 264 pp.; 0-8478-1075-5), which explores through history 
the development of the singular design element of stairs, in all their diverse 
settings, shapes, materials and surprises. Helping the climb and its 
imaginative array of illustrations are photographs by Julius Shulman and a 
striking book design by Dana Levy of Perpetua Press. 
</P>
<P>
Of particular interest to California architecture buffs should be Gilbert 
Stanley Underwood: His Rustic, Art Deco, and Federal Architecture by Joyce 
Zaitlin, (Pangloss Press: $35; 185 pp.; 0-934710-18-X). The thin, modestly 
illustrated monograph traces Underwood's maverick career, which included the 
designs of the rustic Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite and, in Los Angeles, the 
landmark post office and Federal Courthouse downtown, and the Wilshire Tower 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Other architecture and design offerings of note this holiday season include 
Mackintosh's Masterwork (Chronicle Books: $35; 224 pp.; 0-87701-663-1), a study 
of the design, detailing and furnishings of the Glasgow School of Art compiled 
by the school's staff. The well-illustrated study places the school styled by 
Charles Rennie Mackintosh a century ago into its proper perspective as a 
seminal design, crafted within a variety of constraints to bridge the art and 
architecture of the 19th Century to the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
There also is the usual array of monographs this season. Among the more 
engaging is that of the late Belgian architect and teacher, Henry van de Velde, 
by Klaus-Jurgen Semach (Rizzoli: $50; 228 pp.; 0-8478-0858-0); the modernist 
Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill by Carol Herselle Krinsky 
(MIT Press: $50; 432 pp.; 0-262-11130-6), and The Architecture of Gunnar 
Birkerts by Kay Kaiser (The American Institute of Architecture Press: $45; 206 
pp.; 1-55835-051-9). Aided by Kaiser's insightful text, the latter illustrates 
well Birkerts' sensitivity to site and client to defy categorization. 
</P>
<P>
For those with an interest in planning, Downtown, Inc.: How America Rebuilds 
Cities by Bernard J. Frieden and Lynne B. Sagalyn (MIT Press: $19.95; 375 pp.; 
0-262-06128-7) offers an informed view of the politics and design involved in 
the renewal of cities. 
</P>
<P>
Touching upon urban renewal, and every other aspect of architecture and design 
from personalities to planning theories, from vague theories to specific 
buildings, has been the London-based Blueprint magazine. What makes the 
magazine stand out among a gaggle of professional and trade publications is 
that it has bite. This, happily, is very much in evidence in From Matt Black to 
Memphis and Back Again (Architecture Design and Technology Press: $49.95; 238 
pp.; 1-85454-250-8), a choice selection of articles from the magazine edited by 
Deyan Sudjic. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the march of Post- Modernism continues, from art and architecture 
into the applied arts everywhere. Very much in step is Post Modern Design by 
Michael Collins and Andreas Papadakis (Rizzoli: $65; 288 pp.; 0-8478-1136-0), 
which displays eye-catching examples of the style in the form of furniture, 
lighting fixtures, glassware, ornaments and, of course, teapots. Explaining the 
various leaps of inspiration from Post-Pop design to the various manifestations 
of Post-Modernism is a welcomed, informative text. But it is the photographs 
that dazzle, just as the lights on a Christmas tree.

BEFORE THE WALL CRACKED;

<P>
RAPIDLY CHANGING TIMES DATE A SHOW OF 12 EAST GERMAN ARTISTS AT UCLA'S WIGHT 
GALLERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The tumultuous epidemic of freedom erupted of late in Eastern Europe should 
make UCLA's current exhibition as timely as the headlines. Titled "Twelve 
Artists from the German Democratic Republic" the show is the first of its kind 
in the U.S. and purports to act as a revelation for any citizen laboring under 
the delusion that art behind the Berlin Wall is nothing more than slavish 
Soviet-style Socialist Realism with its illustrative superman Stakhanovites and 
amazons in babushkas. 
</P>
<P>
Actually the rush of real events races so far in front of the two- or 
three-year lag-time required to organize an international traveling exhibition 
that time conspires to make any such contemporary art show obsolete before it 
gets on the wall. Art is fueling itself on extra-artistic shtick these days. It 
may pack in the viewers but artistic quality is suffering thereby. Anybody who 
looks outside our borders has known for several years that GDR artists have not 
been under aesthetic constraints since the '50s and have been pretty well free 
to do their own thing since the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Those who put themselves to the trouble of a little puddle-jumper jet ride to 
San Francisco recently saw a show at that city's Museum of Modern Art called 
"10 + 10" which proved that even Soviet artists don't do Socialist Realism 
these days, if they don't feel like it. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the trendiness issue is partly a red herring in these shows. But they do 
contribute to the general realization that, if all this keeps up, we may have 
to rejigger our mental map of the world and recast our interior certainties 
about who the good and bad guys are and who practices which aesthetic. After 
all, our currently fashionable media-based art in the Museum of Contemporary 
Art's recent "A Forest of Signs" or the Whitney's "Image World" can plausibly 
be construed as a form of social if not Socialist realism with its heavy 
cultural and political commentary. Maybe all this real-world stuff is happening 
because as they become more like us, we become more like them. There are 
significant infusions of old Russian avant-garde agitprop and German Dada 
yuppie-fied in current American work. Maybe it is an omen. 
</P>
<P>
Transformative events move so rapidly in the GDR that the 
dozen-from-Deutschland show at UCLA's Wight Gallery (to Jan. 21) might carry 
the invisible subtitle, "The Way We Were." Organized by the Busch-Reisinger 
Museum at Harvard University, it was selected by its curator Peter Nisbet, 
veteran critic Dore Ashton and historian Peter Selz. Their catalogue essays 
combine to contribute to the feeling that this art had slipped into the past 
even before The Wall was breached. 
</P>
<P>
There is something reassuring about the ensemble at first blush. It harks back 
to artistic attitudes held here 30 years ago when careers in art were virtually 
non-existent and people who wanted to be serious were perfectly willing to take 
modest teaching posts and work like austere monks, nourishing art on history 
and literature, the concerts and plays on campus, their private lives and 
secret emotions. 
</P>
<P>
The GDR work carries this kind of intellectual sobriety and dedication to 
obscurity. Significantly the works are all painting and graphics searching for 
the individual frisson in traditional form. It shows very little overt 
political or social commentary given that German art is traditionally soaked 
with Kunstpolitik. The closest approach is in the painting of Thomas Ziegler, a 
handsome guy of 42, who lives in Schwerin and owns a dog who looks like Spuds 
MacKenzie. 
</P>
<P>
His "Soviet Soldiers" is a four-panel quartet of portraits joined by 
Soviet-scarlet backgrounds, baby blue frames and a kind of teeter-totter bench 
painted through the four panels. The big-headed soldiers pose in uniform 
looking suitably intense but not threatening. What might be caricature is 
transformed into humanism even touched with sentimentality. Just an 
Expressionist figurative artist doing his thing. 
</P>
<P>
Read between paint-strokes and this art does reveal life in the GDR. During the 
period of the greatest forced artistic conformity, the hot artists in the West 
were mainly in the mold of England's Francis Bacon. It seems these East block 
artists wanted nothing better than to be able to probe this forbidden manner 
and to get back the native German styles proscribed by Hitler's "Degenerate 
Art" campaign -- the pioneering art that began with Dresden's Die Bruecke (The 
Bridge) and ended with the late left-wing Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity). 
</P>
<P>
There is something touching in the modest aspiration to practice in the shadow 
of artists that represented the good old days. Veteran septuagenarian Willi 
Sitte perpetuates a predecessor in his "Homage to Lovis Corinth" but the 
original's animal charge gives way to a tenacious weariness. 
</P>
<P>
Francis Bacon pops up again in the black paintings of Berlin's Heinrich Tessmer 
whose brooding self-portraits alternate with drawn "rat sheets" where pairs of 
rodents become metaphors of the relations between the sexes. The work recalls 
what happened to the city of Alfred Doblin's novel "Berlin Alexanderplatz" 
after it was pulverized by the war and everybody lived in ruined cellars. 
</P>
<P>
Echos of post-war Existential Paris echo in another Berlin artist, Walter 
Libuda. There are bits of Jean Dubuffet here along with an upside-down hat 
tipped to his successful west-end colleague George Baselitz and hints of 
British kitchen-sink humanists like Leon Kossoff. 
</P>
<P>
Funny. At 39 Libuda is one of the youngest artists represented but his work has 
spiritual contact with the senior figure, Dresden's 88-year-old Theodor 
Rosenhauer. Both make an art about lives lived in quiet desperation. 
Rosenhauer's seasoned vision sees a cemetery landscape in winter and brings it 
an aura of metaphysical resignation. Desperation still makes Libuda a little 
crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Viewed artistically the Angst that joins all this work must come from its 
shared awareness of stagnation. Everybody here works with shards and tatters of 
German Expressionism whose great days ended a half-century ago. Leipzig's 
Sighard Gille tries to get one more drop of juice out of a pastiche of Nolde, 
Beckmann and Dix in the Christ-complex fantasy, "Party in Leipzig." 
Miraculously he succeeds in patches where the paint is as sexy as the subjects. 
Veteran fellow Leipziger Bernhard Heisig paints nightmare war fantasies and a 
fascinating double-read picture that is both a memento mori still life and a 
skeleton playing a trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways Dresdener Max Uhlig sums up the problem. He makes figures by 
painting with the abstract stabs and skeins of a Jackson Pollock. He works well 
as do most of these artists -- too well. Results looks like they were painted 
by a sleepwalker motel artist, skillful but bored silly. 
</P>
<P>
Old German Expressionism grew out of a very bad patch in history but it was 
also a time of immense creativity from the Danube to the Kurfurstendamm and it 
crackled with sarcasm, jazz and tango. The GDR work is dignified and 
discouraged behind its professorial caricature. 
</P>
<P>
Several artists have drifted into near-autistic spiritual isolation. Gerhard 
Altenbourg makes wispy works on paper that are heads becoming progressively 
invisible. Carlfreidrich Claus does philosophical landscapes made up of 
handwriting. Michael Morgner makes dark splash abstractions with gridded 
figures of the crucified Christ. Wolfgang Smy makes innocent bathing figures 
that add a touch of the sinister to Max Pechstein. 
</P>
<P>
All seem close to running on empty while calmly aware of their plight. You like 
these guys for sticking to their guns but you get the feeling they are aimed at 
crumbling bastions whose disappearance may create a newness more frightening 
that the dreary comfort of the familiar.

WHY SCHOOLKIDS HANG IN THERE (OR DON'T) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN MEYER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We need no reminding that too many of our kids can't read, can't do math, can't 
understand basic geography. The Japanese are far ahead of us; so are plenty of 
others. Searching for a cause, we blame the schools; schools blame parents. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a palliative, writers write and publishers publish hundreds of 
information books for children, fingers crossed that someone -- an alert 
librarian, a sensitive teacher, an involved parent -- will get these books into 
the hands of kids to whom they'll matter. 
</P>
<P>
The range of subject matter explored in nonfiction for young readers reaches 
from here to the stars. Heiderose and Andreas Fischer-Nagel use magnified 
photographs to explore the fascinating goings-on in An Ant Colony (Carolrhoda 
Books: $12.95; 48 pp.). At the other end of the size spectrum, E. C. Krupp, an 
astronomer and director of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, and his wife, 
Robin Rector Krupp, an artist, collaborated to make The Big Dipper and You 
(Morrow Junior Books: $13.95; 48 pp.) a clear and sometimes amusing 
introduction to the sky. 
</P>
<P>
William Jaspersohn, a writer in Vermont, and Chuck Eckart, an artist in 
California, combined talents in How the Forest Grew (Greenwillow Books: $10.95; 
56 pp.), an attractive portrait of the long, slow cycle of nature that 
transforms open farmland to mature forest. The changing plant and animal life 
are illustrated by Chuck Eckart in nicely detailed pen-and-ink drawings. 
</P>
<P>
Why does anyone write? And what do the life stories of women writers, past and 
present, say to young people -- those who are merely curious and those who 
dream of the writing life -- about what it is to be a writer? 
</P>
<P>
Lucinda Irwin Smith explores these questions in Women Who Write (Messner: 
$9.95; 192 pp.), with profiles of seven writers from the past -- women as 
varied and distinct as Emily Dickinson, Anne Frank, Agatha Christie, and 
Virginia Woolf. She also interviews 12 contemporary authors, including 
journalists, novelists, poets, and others whose names may not be so familiar. 
The final section is addressed to "You, the writer." I might quibble now about 
some of this -- the interviews could be more effective -- but I would have 
devoured this book when I was a kid, secretly writing, secretly dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
All of these books are interesting and attractive enough to kindle a spark of 
interest in many kids. They are solidly non-controversial. But two other 
nonfiction books are guaranteed to provoke heated debate. 
</P>
<P>
E. D. Hirsch Jr.'s A First Dictionary of Cultural Literacy: What Our Children 
Need to Know by (Houghton Mifflin: $14.95; 271 pp.) is a collection of more 
than 2,000 brief entries alphabetically arranged in 21 categories, from history 
and geography to art and science. Hirsch, author of a similar book for adults 
published last year, believes there's a broad common body of knowledge with 
which everyone should be familiar in order to understand American culture. He 
also believes there is a core of knowledge that children need to learn by the 
end of sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
Hirsch's ideas have led to the debate in educational circles about the value of 
creating a core curriculum for our schools, a standard by which all high school 
graduates would then be judged. But this "First Dictionary" is appallingly 
Eurocentric. The dark side of Eurocentrism, an outdated and rather quaint 
notion if it weren't so dangerous, is that it denigrates or ignores the 
contributions of all other civilizations, particularly those on our own 
continent. Whose culture are we talking about when we say American culture? 
</P>
<P>
Another book that could provoke thoughtful discussion is When I Was Young I 
Loved School: Dropping Out and Hanging In (Meckler Corp., distributor: $9.95, 
paper; 213 pp.), compiled by the Children's Express, a news service reported by 
children under age 13 working with teen-age editors. If you've ever wondered 
why kids drop out, why they run away, and what makes some of them come back to 
school to try again, take a long, hard look at these interviews. Thirteen of 
CE's teen-age editors talked to hundreds to kids -- no adults allowed -- and 
wound up with 23 edited interviews; also included are a principal who was 
himself once a dropout, and a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
The results are stunning. You can't ignore the pain and fear and anger of the 
teen-agers whose voices are recorded here; nor can you help noticing their 
stubbornness, their self-centeredness, and their rationalizing. Some lack 
direction and self-discipline; others seem to have been blocked at every turn 
by, or abandoned by, the adults responsible for them. Some kids blame their 
parents, and it does seem that many of the parents lack stability and 
self-discipline themselves. Some kids blame their teachers, and it's plain that 
may teachers either don't care or have been worn down by overwork, 
under-funding, and a classroom full of out-of-control kids. It's nobody's 
fault, and everybody's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wild Rover," Meyer's newest novel for teen-agers, was published recently by 
McElderry Books.

YOUNG ADULT FICTION; 
</P>
<P>
EVERY CHILD HAS A STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BOTTNER, Bottner's first young adult novel, Nothing in Common, has 
recently been optioned for the movies. Her most recent young adult novel, Let 
Me Tell You Everything, will be a Simon &amp; Schuster paperback in 1990. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our young people struggle to "Just Say No" in a country where too many 
disenfranchised kids have little to say "yes" to. In their culturally correct 
clothing labels, they anguish over belonging, while they absorb, at strenuous 
decibels, the latest heavy-metal lyrics angrily demanding autonomy: 
</P>
<P>
"... no need to hear things 
</P>
<P>
that they say, 
</P>
<P>
life is for my own, to live my 
</P>
<P>
own way. 
</P>
<P>
See them try to bring the hammer 
</P>
<P>
down, 
</P>
<P>
no damn chains can hold me to the 
</P>
<P>
ground." 
</P>
<P>
It is the ubiquitous job of children to become themselves, to form their 
destinies as distinct from those of their parents, to find their places in the 
culture at large. But on other continents, and at other times, these tasks have 
been undertaken against social conditions distinctly different from our own. 
</P>
<P>
In We Were Not Like Other People (Harper &amp; Row: $13.95), well-known Soviet 
author and film director Ephraim Sevela tells the story of a young Jewish boy, 
separated from his family by the German Invasion at the outbreak of World War 
II. His mother is a champion sprinter, and from her he learns some tough 
lessons: "Mother could not bear weak, whiny children who could not stand up for 
themselves, especially if they were boys. Mama despised me. Only a conqueror 
could hope to attain her love." She grabs his ear "with iron fingers," forcing 
him to fight the bigger neighborhood boys. Excellent preparation for survival, 
it turns out, when his father, a Red Army commander, is taken away in the 
night, declared an "enemy of the People" during a Stalinist purge. 
</P>
<P>
At 12, the boy gets separated from his mother, and for six years, from Siberia 
to the snow-capped Urals to the Volga and Germany, our young hero must live 
through the war unprotected. He is rescued by a woman with five daughters, who 
asks what a Jew is. "Ordinary people," he explains, and the woman declares, 
"Then there is nothing to discuss," and puts him in bed with the whole family. 
In Orel, he meets up with his detested schoolteacher, the Walrus, who calls him 
"Neanderthal" but nonetheless saves his life. 
</P>
<P>
As the war progresses, he is adopted by an influential Colonel and goes into 
battle with this soldier's regiment, only to watch the beloved man die the day 
peace is declared. He writes letters home to the wife and children of another 
comrade, letters so tender and full of love that the tough private gratefully 
concludes: "It'll make the old woman bawl." He learns to "wait very hard," to 
curse like an adult, and to mete out compassion to a starving German family 
whose home he has invaded. 
</P>
<P>
Filled with poignant vignettes and glorious characters, this Russian boy 
experiences more than many will in a lifetime. This wonderful book is about 
growing up in extraordinary circumstances, and is full of aches, full of echoes 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Shabanu, Daughter of the Wind (Alfred A. Knopf: $13.95) by Suzanne Fisher 
Staples -- a former UPI correspondent in Asia, and foreign-desk reporter for 
the Washington Post -- tells the story of a nomad girl in present-day 
Pakistan's Cholistan Desert. 
</P>
<P>
This is the year Shabanu's beautiful sister Phulan, age 13, is betrothed; the 
arranged marriage will take place after Ramandan, or the month of Islamic 
fasting. Shabanu, 11, still just a girl who tends with great love to the 
animals, has a while to consider her own forthcoming betrothal. When her 
favorite camel Gulaband is sold to pay for Phulan's wedding and dowry, Shabanu 
experiences her first loss. Many more follow. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes sheer detail -- of the fierce desert sun, the challenging land, the 
artifacts and traditions of this nomadic people -- overwhelms the narrative. 
Yet Fisher Staples succeeds in establishing the reality of this world and the 
strict customs and rules that govern it. 
</P>
<P>
But the merciless man-made laws are still more forgiving than the raw forces of 
nature: In one tense scene a monstrous desert sandstorm comes upon the family 
too quickly for them to rescue their ailing grandfather. He miraculously 
survives, but only long enough only to request a site for his burial ground. 
Another loss for Shabanu. 
</P>
<P>
But the heart of the novel, taking place almost two-thirds through the book, is 
about Shabanu's future. Just as Phulan's wedding is about to take place, the 
landlord tries to rape her. Shabanu struggles to prevent the violation of her 
sister, and the crazed, infuriated landlord kills Phulan's husband-to-be, and 
vows to kill his brother Murad, Shabanu's future husband. To stop the madman, 
Shabanu must marry the landlord's brother, wealthy Rahimabhib, who already has 
three wives. Will she tolerate the detestable solution and bring peace to the 
family, or will she join her remarkably independent aunt and cousin -- 
outsiders who live in freedom, without men? 
</P>
<P>
Shabanu's destiny may be incomprehensible to American readers, but we all are 
enriched from meeting this undaunted, indomitable nomad girl. 
</P>
<P>
In London, 9-year-old Phillip Holbein faces problems that are more familiar to 
American youth; they include the torments of torn loyalties and broken homes. 
Nina Bawden's The Robbers (Lothrop, Lee &amp; Shepard: $12.95) deals with a 
friendship between two boys: one born to privilege, the other to poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip is summoned to London from his country castle, where he lives with his 
beloved grandmother, to visit his newly married father, a well-known television 
news announcer; Phillip adamantly falls in with his new city friend, Darcy 
Jones, whose father is crippled and whose stepmother, Addie, is beautiful and 
black. 
</P>
<P>
When Darcy's wage-earning brother is thrown in jail, Phillip tries to help 
Darcy find solutions to his family's fragile economic situation, which is made 
worse by Addie's pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
To earn money, Phillip goes caroling with Darcy, who possesses a glorious 
singing voice. But when Darcy's singing is cruelly insulted by penurious rich 
people, and they collect only meager funds, Phillip becomes willing to strike 
out against a society that unjustly punishes this struggling, beloved family. 
He agrees to commit robbery. 
</P>
<P>
This comfortable tale of an uncomfortable world, originally published in 
England in 1979, has Dickensian overtones and the sadness inherent growing up 
in a society that is not really all right. Bawden tells it with a sure voice 
and appealing characters. She sides with the children, as we all must do.

When a reviewer asserts that a writer's work "is marred by factual errors," he 
or she had best scrutinize his or her notes. 
</P>
<P>
In Tom Dardis' piece on my new biography, "Huxley in Hollywood" (Book Review, 
Oct. 22), he suggests that I have incorrectly married Bertolt Brecht to 
screenwriter Salka Viertel and misdated Weill's "Johnny Johnson." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I wrote that Brecht used Viertel's garage as a studio, and that the 
1936 "Johnny Johnson" was newly topical in 1939. Dardis, who consistently 
misspells Viertel's name -- and mine -- should be more careful.

I read Mary King's review of Ralph Abernathy's "And the Walls Came Tumbling 
Down." I hope to read the book. Provided I can figure out a way to do so 
without buying it. 
</P>
<P>
My disillusionment with Dr. Abernathy began when it became apparent that he 
could not carry the banner that he had grabbed from the dying hands of Martin 
Luther King as King fell. But then, who could? 
</P>
<P>
That disillusionment was complete some months ago as I dutifully went through 
the several pounds of mail solicitations I receive each week. There it was, 
Ralph David Abernathy, among the names of board members of some organization 
that was raising funds for Col. Oliver North's defense. (How did I get on that 
mailing list?) 
</P>
<P>
I wrote Abernathy in care of the organization, whose name I did little note or 
long remember. I wanted to know how a man who once marched with Martin King 
could now fall in step with Oliver North. I never got an answer. 
</P>
<P>
Direct mailing being what it is, hundreds of thousands must have received that 
solicitation. I have never heard anyone else ever raise the question. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Abernathy has taken his considerable ego to other parts of the body 
politic in an effort to find gratification.

The great outdoors has become so commercialized in recent years that it's 
difficult to believe that for most of human history, mountains were regarded as 
obstacles to travelers that no sane person would climb unless compelled. Jeremy 
Bernstein traces the history of the sport of mountaineering from its origins in 
the Chamonix region of France in the late 18th Century through the present day. 
An enthusiastic climber, Bernstein blends first-person adventures with 
historical research and reflection in chapter-length essays that began as 
articles for The New Yorker. Entertaining reading for the real or armchair 
outdoorsman.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE KING OF THE FIELDS BY ISAAC BASHEVIS SINGER (PLUME:

One of Singer's most recent and curious works, "King of the Fields," contains 
the elements of a Greek tragedy: betrayal, revenge, lust and Divine wrath. The 
struggles of Cybula, a petty chieftain, to comprehend the debased nature of 
humanity are crystallized by his confrontation with the resolute virtue of the 
Jewish exile, Ben Dosa. Although the actions and thoughts of the characters 
have the ring of authenticity, Singer seems unable to place the story in time. 
When Cybula and his followers abandon their existence as hunter-gatherers and 
begin to practice agriculture, it appears to be set in prehistoric Poland; when 
they visit a bustling market town, time seems to have shifted several millennia 
forward to the High Middle Ages. "King of the Fields" ends on an 
uncharacteristically dark note: Unlike the oppressed hero of "The Slave," 
Cybula is overcome by the evil he finds within his wife and himself, and 
chooses the God of Death over the God of Life.

Set in the Gironde region of France, this bleak novel presents a three-sided 
conflict: the decadence of the flesh versus antiseptic renunciation versus a 
reverent embrace of life's possibilities. These qualities are embodied in 
Edward, a languid young drone; his sister, May, whose cowardice leads her to 
deny both her passion and her talent, and Claude, a pious young man who 
abandons the seminary to return to life as peasant-laborer. Like oil in water, 
these characters pass through each other's lives but never really interact. The 
eddies caused by their passage are soon calmed, and each proceeds to his 
destiny: to suicide, to a loveless marriage, to wholesome physical labor that 
forges a bond with the enduring land. Gerard Hopkins' translation captures the 
essence of Mauriac's style, but the text is littered with typos, including a 
description of Edward acting from "an access of zeal."

ENDPAPERS: TURNING THE WORDS LOOSE IN PRAGUE

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After 20 years of enforced obscurity Vaclav Havel, Czech playwright 
extaordinary, has exploded onto the television screens of his country and ours. 
No one looks more uncomfortable in the political arena than Havel; he would 
clearly be happier back in the theater, rehearsing one of the dozen or so plays 
he has written since the 1968 Soviet invasion. There are those who feel that 
the production of Havel's plays -- none, new or old, has been allowed on the 
Czech stage for 20 years -- would mean more than all the recent shuffling in 
the political stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks before the shuffling began, Havel received another in his growing 
collection of literary awards. The award, given yearly by the Assn. of German 
Writers to the author who has contibuted most to world peace, is traditionally 
presented at the Frankfurt Book Fair, the annual clearing house for world 
publishing (it exhibited 378,699 titles this October). For the first time in 
the history of the award, the recipient could not attend the ceremony: Havel 
has declined all invitations to leave Czechoslovakia because while the regime 
has been known to let dissidents out, it has never been known to let them back 
in. 
</P>
<P>
Havel's acceptance speech was read by actor Maximilian Schell, who has long 
been associated with the playwright. (West Europeans have regularly seen his 
plays staged, and Angelenos are not far behind, largely thanks to the Mark 
Taper Forum and its director, Gordon Davidson, a personal friend of Havel's.) 
The speech emphasized the power of the word, harking back to "Two Thousand 
Words," the Prague Spring reformers' call to action, which was singled out by 
the Soviets as particularly subversive. In a country where the Soviet invasion 
has been referred to only as "the events" and the return to Stalinism has gone 
by the name of "normalization," words can be a matter of life and death. 
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old Havel has spent a number of the post-invasion years in prison 
for his efforts to set words right, and the German writers were honoring him 
for his "exemplary and persuasive attempt to live in truth." On this occasion 
he chose to discuss a word that has come to be used lightly in our century, 
especially in Eastern Europe. "Words have their history," he said. "There was a 
time, for instance, when entire generations of the humiliated and oppressed 
considered the word socialism a magnetic synonym for a more righteous world, 
and when the ideals expressed by the word led people to sacrifice many years of 
their lives and even life itself for it. I don't know how things stand in your 
country, but in mine the very word socialism has long since turned into a 
rubber truncheon that nouveau riche bureaucrats who believe in nothing use to 
beat their free-thinking fellow-citizens while calling them 'enemies of 
socialism' and 'anti-socialist forces'." 
</P>
<P>
Another of Havel's words with a history is the word history itself. The 
communist regimes claim to represent a science of history governed by the laws 
of dialectical materialism. For them history is moving inexorably forward to 
the utopia that is communism. In his 1975 "Open Letter to President Husak" 
(Husak took over after the Soviet invasion and still holds certain honorary 
positions), Havel accused the regime of calling history to a halt. "True, the 
country is calm," he wrote, "calm as a morgue." The regime fostered entropy, 
order without life, and dressed it up as history. Since the regime had absolute 
power, it could do what it pleased to language as easily and surely as it could 
do what it pleased to people. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Havel is obsessed with history much as he is obsessed with 
words, and he combines his two magnificent obsessions in several plays by 
returning to works with a past. Like Brecht, he has reworked John Gay's 
"Beggar's Opera," and his "Temptation," recently at the Taper, represents a 
stunningly topical yet non-reductionist extension of the Faust legend: The 
devil can't hold a candle to the bureaucrats. In works like these the present 
resonates with history, and history is something Havel takes seriously. If he 
rejects the Communist march of history toward a radiant future, he is 
nonetheless wary of the tendency to dismiss history as absurd and therefore 
worthless. He would certainly agree with Santayana's oft-quoted adage: "Those 
who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Havel has been through too much to assume that merely 
remembering history will repeal the sentence. So back we come to words and, 
more specifically, to the debasement of language that Havel bemoans as much as 
he does the distortion of history. Take "The Memorandum," one of the few Havel 
plays currently available in paperback here. The action begins with a series of 
nonsense syllables. They turn out to be a new language. One bureaucratic agency 
has required another bureaucratic agency to introduce a language with no 
ambiguity; that is, a language with a single word for a single concept. "And 
now I shall name some of the most common interjections," says the teacher 
engaged to teach the language. "Our ah becomes zukybaj; our ouch, bykur; our oh 
becomes hajf dy doretop, pish is bolypak juz, and the interjection of surprise 
well! -- zyk! However, well, well! is not zykzyk!, as some have concluded, but 
zykzym." By choosing interjections, Havel reduces an already ridiculous idea to 
total absurdity (what document will need the word pish?) and makes a point 
about language that holds by analogy for history: It cannot be transformed into 
a set of positivist, absolute, right-or-wrong principles. 
</P>
<P>
Because "The Memorandum" opened in 1965, it could open in Prague, and clearly 
Havel would have preferred to go on communicating with his audience from the 
stage. (The above excerpt gives only a faint idea of how hilariously 
stageworthy that play truly is.) When the "events" and "normalization" closed 
his country's theaters to him, he continued writing plays -- he was 
constitutionally unable to do otherwise. But the plays could only be staged 
abroad; they could not reach their primary public. To reach that public, Havel 
resorted to another genre. 
</P>
<P>
Plays are best read in conjunction with performance, but essays are 
self-contained and thought-provoking and can circulate with relative ease in 
clandestine carbons. Havel became an essayist in spite of himself as he became 
an activist in spite of himself. Both aspects of this new life came to a head 
with the formation of Charter 77, the Czechoslovak opposition's response to the 
Helsinki Agreements and by now the longest-lived human rights organization in 
the East bloc. 
</P>
<P>
As Charter 77's first spokesman, Havel often found himself exhorting his 
fellow-countrymen to do more or less what he was recently praised for in 
Frankfurt, that is, to "live in truth," stand behind what they think and do, 
vouch for themselves, take responsibility for their own acts. His 
fellow-countrymen soon watched him go to jail for his principles. He did not 
convert large numbers of them. As he points out to his wife in the edifying and 
moving prison diary "Letters to Olga," he realized that his stand made him seem 
a martyr to some and a goody-goody to others; it may even have diminished his 
influence. Again he was constitutionally unable to do otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that is why he has emerged from it all with his faith in humanity 
intact. "I am not interested in why man commits evil," he writes in the 
Letters; "I want to know why he does good (here and there) or at least feels he 
ought to." Once the political situation in Czechoslovakia is on an even keel, 
Havel will doubtless abandon the political platform for the stage; he will go 
back to writing plays that explore why man does good. Let us do what we can to 
keep them on our stages, and let us hope audiences in his own country will soon 
be able to see his repertory in its entirety. The amazing events of the past 
few weeks can have left only the most cynical unconvinced of the possibility of 
change. To them I say, with Havel: "Half dy doretop, bolypak juz!"

RECORD RACK: NO GREAT STRIDES ON 'JOURNEYMAN';

ERIC CLAPTON "JOURNEYMAN." WARNER BROS. ** 1/2

"Agoraphobic" might be a more appropriate title, so safe and close to home does 
Clapton play it here. "Journeyman" is a far cry superior to his previous 
platter, "August," to be certain; a change in producers from Phil Collins to 
Russ Titelman has helped. But seeing how good guitar-playing can redeem bad 
tunesmanship only so much -- and how Clapton's inexpressive voice redeems it 
not at all -- he's once again at the mercy of the material he's picked, which 
doesn't find him journeying beyond his recent 
'80s-yups-with-CD-players-oriented boundaries near enough. 
</P>
<P>
The better choices include one of Ray Charles' patented happy-sounding, 
horn-filled blues, "Hard Times"; a version of "Hound Dog" that comes close to 
what Ry Cooder or David Lindley might do with the oldie; another '50s relic, 
"Before You Accuse Me," one of several cuts to feature slide-vs.-slowhand 
dueling with Robert Cray, and, best of all, R&amp;B faves Cecil and Linda 
Womack's "Lead Me On," with its writers joining in on vocals. This track is a 
moving ballad of jealousy that includes telling emotional details, something 
missing in all the other songs. 
</P>
<P>
On the minus side are the uniformly mediocre tracks by Clapton's favorite 
commercial writer of the moment, Jerry Williams, which take up five of the 
album's 12 slots along with the accompanying mod programming nonsense. George 
Harrison's contribution sounds like an outtake from one of his lesser 
middle-period albums. It's all competent background music at worst; it's your 
12 bucks, digital heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one (poor) to five (a classic) stars.CHRIS

WHERE THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL'S $13.6 MILLION GOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Arts Council has 11 members who serve staggered four-year terms. 
The governor appoints nine, while the Assembly Speaker and the Senate Rules 
Committee each appoint one member. In its current fiscal year, the council will 
hand out $13.6 million to 1,015 organizations and to about 275 artists. (The 
remaining $3.1 million of its $16.7 million budget is for administration.) 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest chunk of the California Arts Council's money, some $6.9 
million, is distributed through its Organizational Support program. Those 
nonprofit arts organizations who apply for grants from the Arts Council get the 
equivalent of a report card each year. The grade, a numerical ranking from 4 
down to 1 (and 1 means don't fund), helps determine how much money an 
organization eventually receives. The amount generally must be matched by 
private donors. 
</P>
<P>
Using complex Arts Council formulas, an organization's budget helps determine 
how much it can apply for, thereby helping to weight things in favor of bigger 
groups. But even if an organization scores a perfect 4, it doesn't get all the 
money it asks for; that is dependent on the number of applicants and the pot of 
available money. 
</P>
<P>
This year small and mid-sized organizations who earned a 4 ranking received 65% 
of what they asked for, down to a cut off of 8% for those ranking 3-. 
Organizations ranking 2+ and below got nothing because, as a council staffer 
noted, "we ran out of money." 
</P>
<P>
Each August, the council votes on whether to accept or reject the rankings of 
peer-review panels in a particular artistic discipline such as music, dance or 
theater. Those members who are tied to a specific organization -- like Arts 
Council chairman Joanne Kozberg, who is also on the board of the Music Center 
-- abstain when particular grant comes up. Ranks and comments are distributed 
in a black-bound book the size of a telephone directory. 
</P>
<P>
Large organizations like the Los Angeles Philharmonic, with budgets of $1 
million or more a year, are also reviewed by a separate "outreach" panel which 
determines how well the organization meets the needs of the community at large. 
The big budget organizations receive a grade average of their two scores -- in 
outreach (to poorer communities, senior citizens, etc.) and artistic 
quality/administration. 
</P>
<P>
Large budget organizations with a perfect 4 average, which none had, would have 
gotten 85% of their request this fiscal year. The Los Angeles Philharmonic got 
the council's biggest grant at $306,380, or 65% of what it requested, even 
though its score was 4/3+. At $29 million, the Philharmonic's budget -- nearly 
twice as large the council's own budget -- is the highest arts budget in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
About 70 organizations each received the Arts Council's lowest grant of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the panel called it "a truly great ensemble," 
adding: "The panel prefers not to speculate about (Andre) Previn's departure, 
but will be interested in watching how the balance of power is worked out in 
the future between (executive vice president Ernest Fleischmann) and a new 
artistic director." 
</P>
<P>
However the Lesbian/Gay Chorus of San Francisco, which requested $9,500, scored 
2+ and got nothing, received this comment: "The panel has become very worried 
about the musical health of this orchestra. It's commendable that the music 
director wants to program challenging work, but it is musically irresponsible 
to program major pieces by Strauss, Stravinsky and Ravel when they are simply 
beyond the technical reach of the players." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Art Council's other grants programs are: 
</P>
<P>
* $2.4 million for its "artists in residence program" employing performing and 
visual artists in schools, prisons, hospitals, and an artist fellowship 
program. 
</P>
<P>
* $1.9 million for various statewide projects including the "state-local 
partnership" program in which the council awards grants to most of the 62 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
* $785,000 for its "performing arts touring and presenting" program, which 
supports "presentation of high quality performing artists to audiences 
throughout California especially those with no ready access, geographically or 
economically." 
</P>
<P>
* $650,000 for special multicultural grants. JUDITH MICHAELSON

In Los Angeles, the most important is the hot new restaurant -- the one that 
just opened, the one that everybody talks about, the one that nobody can get 
into. Hot new restaurants, however, don't last; sooner or later they either die 
or turn into one of the other varieties. 
</P>
<P>
Some become occasion places -- the restaurants you go to on your anniversary, 
on your birthday or when your boss is taking you for an expense account 
blow-out. These are the restaurants that invariably crop up on those lists of 
the best places in town. Owning such a restaurant is good for the ego. It can, 
however, be hard on the pocketbook, and most restaurateurs will tell you that 
all they really want is a restaurant of the third kind: the beloved 
neighborhood joint. 
</P>
<P>
This is the kind of place that people go to again and again, the place that 
they think of as a home away from home. This is a restaurant where the waiters 
know you, you know the menu, and the chef knows your tastes. 
</P>
<P>
Some beloved restaurants become famous; Spago and Chasen's are, after all, 
nothing more than neighborhood restaurants for stars. Most beloved restaurants, 
however, have a different clientele. They are frequented by ordinary people who 
live nearby and like the way the restaurant makes them feel. Each of these 
restaurants is a reflection of its neighborhood, and most go on for years 
making many people very happy. Recently I ate at two such restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I was a regular when the free pizza finally appeared on the table," 
said the friend who took me to Il Forno. One of the dozens of people whose 
devotion to the place knows no bounds, he's a regular who has been touting the 
place to me for quite some time. Judging by the numbers of free pizzas on the 
tables, he is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
But how can you tell which pizzas are free? "It's easy," confides my friend, 
"This one's not on the menu. It's called pizza Ken, and you can't order it. See 
-- it has no cheese." Pizza Ken is a light, crisp crust topped with a fine 
plain tomato sauce and a few shiitake mushrooms. I can see how it could easily 
become addictive; I'm already wondering how I am going to get one the next time 
I come in. How long before you become a regular? 
</P>
<P>
Probably a long time; it looks as if this small, clamorous restaurant is not in 
need of new customers. Most of the people who walk through the door seem to 
know one other. Kids hop from table to table, plates are passed around, there 
are a lot of waves and hugs. You are warmed by the atmosphere, and it feels 
very good to be here -- at least once you get used to the decibel level. 
</P>
<P>
The people who own Il Forno have done a very smart thing; they have created a 
trattoria for Los Angeles. It doesn't look like an Italian trattoria: It's a 
spare room in a shopping mall with an open kitchen and too many tables squeezed 
into too small a space. It doesn't taste like a trattoria in Italy either: The 
food is pure L.A.-Italian, a mixture of very good pizzas, good salads, eclectic 
pastas with an American amount of sauce (too much), and entrees that are 
characterized by their robust flavors and generous size. But it feels like a 
trattoria: unpretentious, neighborly, overwhelmingly comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
The pizzas are memorable. I barely manage to prevent myself from ordering 
another. Instead we have a seafood salad made of baby shrimp, octopus, Calamata 
olives and squid tossed in a lemony dressing. If the squid were cooked a few 
seconds less, the salad would be even better. Pastas are served in enormous 
portions. They are so good that before I realize what I have done I have 
finished off a plateful of what look like torn ruffly edges of lasagna noodles 
in a lamb-based sauce. 
</P>
<P>
My friend insists on ordering tonight's special pasta as well. "The owner says 
it's great," he says. It didn't sound great to me; it sounded as if it 
contained far too many ingredients. When the waiter was explaining it I got as 
far as chicken breasts, pine nuts, radicchio, sun-dried tomatoes, shiitake . . 
. and then lost track. We taste the dish, and sure enough, too many 
ingredients. It pains my friend to admit that the owner was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"But try this," he says, tucking into an enormous, and slightly tough veal chop 
topped with a mountain of shiitake mushrooms. "Isn't it great? We don't usually 
order entrees," he admits, "usually we just have salad and pizza and pasta and 
get out the door for about $40 for two of us." He looks over at my plate, 
spears one of my Hawaiian prawns in white-wine and garlic sauce (very big and 
very good) and mentions that we really shouldn't miss the tirami su. 
</P>
<P>
Of course Il Forno has tirami su. It is, after all, on the Westside where every 
hip restaurant is noisy and no hip restaurant is without tirami su. 
</P>
<P>
It's good tirami su. But personally I'd rather have another pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 Il Forno, 2901 Ocean Park Boulevard, Santa Monica. (213) 450-1241. Dinner for 
two, $30-$60. 
</P>
<P>
 Il Forno is the almost-perfect Westside restaurant -- friendly and trendy all 
at the same time. Cafe Jacoulet is something else. It did not, after all, get 
to be the most beloved restaurant in Pasadena by catering to Westside tastes. 
Once you get past the retail store at the entrance, with its case filled with 
food-to-go and its racks filled with wine, you find yourself in a grown-up 
restaurant: It is a place where you wouldn't feel uncomfortable wearing a suit 
and where you wouldn't find it difficult to have a conversation -- even without 
raising your voice. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello Bob, Hello Mrs. Davis," says the maitre d', leading people to their 
tables. Is there anybody he doesn't know? It hardly seems so. Once again this 
is a friendly place where almost everybody seems like a regular. But, unlike Il 
Forno, this is a decorated and decorous room. The people sitting beneath those 
pretty Japanese prints don't table hop; they simply sit in their seats and wave 
discretely at one another. 
</P>
<P>
When Cafe Jacoulet first opened, California cuisine was so rare that it was 
almost instantly dubbed "a poor man's Michael's." Now that California cuisine 
is ubiquitous, it's hard to see the connection: This food seems closer to the 
Franco-Japanese food served in restaurants such as Chaya Brasserie than that of 
your typical California grill. 
</P>
<P>
The menu is written daily, but there are dishes that I remember from the first 
time that I ate here, more than five years ago. Pasadena, unlike many other 
parts of town, has a sense of history. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this "wan tan de thon cru a la moutarde." Haven't I seen it somewhere 
before? As soon as it is set before me I remember; it was one of the signature 
dishes at the late La Petite Chaya. Won ton skins are deep-fried and layered 
with raw tuna and sliced avocado; there's a mustard dressing over the whole. 
It's a pretty dish -- but one that could use some of the ponzu sauce that is 
served on the chilled Oregon oysters. The oysters, I might point out, are 
wonderful -- and I can't think of another restaurant where you would get so 
many for $6.75. 
</P>
<P>
I like the asparagus served with shrimp and saffron sauce; it's one of those 
old-fashioned sort of dishes that you don't see much anymore. I can't say the 
same for the shiitake stuffed with lobster mousse. The mushrooms are battered 
like tempura then deep-fried and served with a Balsamic vinaigrette. It sounds 
unusual and intriguing, but the hot vinegar is so potent that it makes my eyes 
water. I find it hard to eat the dish. 
</P>
<P>
It is the only frightening food I've been served at Cafe Jacoulet: This is, 
after all, a restaurant where you can still sit down to dinner and have nothing 
more than a green salad and a bowl of onion soup without the waiter so much as 
cracking a frown. Tonight we are offered slices of duck breast in an 
almost-anachronistic raspberry sauce. Filet mignon served in shallot sauce, 
medallions of veal with mushrooms. The most outre of the entrees is the likable 
salmon in red wine sauce -- and even that is hardly new-fangled. 
</P>
<P>
Do we like our dinner? The maitre d' would like to know. We sip our coffee, eat 
our lovely lemon tarts and tell him we do. But what we like even more is that, 
this once, we really believe that he cares. 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe Jacoulet, 91 N. Raymond Avenue, Pasadena. (818) 796-2233. Open for lunch 
Tuesday through Saturday, dinner Tuesday through Sunday, brunch Sunday. Dinner 
for two, food only, $40-$75.

'WRECK JUNIOR'; 
</P>
<P>
NOEL HARRISON TAKES ANOTHER STEP TOWARD ESTABLISHING A SEPARATE IDENTITY FROM 
HIS FAMOUS FATHER, REX ('WRECK SENIOR') HARRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Noel Harrison is convinced he has a psychic connection with Jacques Brel. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first saw him perform -- I was in my teens in a bar in Belgium -- he 
absolutely blew me away," recalled the actor-singer. "Years later, I had the 
idea for a show. Then I had the dream." Harrison's semi-prophetic vision, an 
imagined encounter between the two men, eventually led to his creation of 
"Adieu, Jacques. . . !" (at Theatre/Theater in Hollywood), a one-man tribute to 
the life, music and influence of the late Belgian singer and songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
It's not the first time the actor, 55, has called on a creative alliance with 
Brel. Arriving in the United States in 1965, Harrison (who sang the 
Oscar-winning "Windmills of Your Mind" for the film "The Thomas Crown Affair") 
followed up his Top-40 recording of "A Young Girl" with a translation of Brel's 
"Marieke" -- one of the 17 songs in this show. "It didn't do anything," he 
noted dryly. "So I sort of left the whole singing side of my life and did 'The 
Girl From U.N.C.L.E.' " 
</P>
<P>
The 1966 spy series with Stefanie Powers marked what he refers to as "my days 
as a starlet, a TV celebrity -- and all that entails." It also coincided with 
the end of his first marriage and the start of a 19-year union with his second 
wife, Margaret. "We were both running away from L.A.," he said of their 
subsequent exodus. "Partly, it was a lack of privacy. Also, I didn't like being 
a celebrity, didn't feel like I'd done anything to deserve the recognition I 
was getting." 
</P>
<P>
Wanting to live in the country, the couple sampled Spain and Maine before 
settling for 10 years in Nova Scotia, where Harrison built a home, worked in 
the woods, learned beekeeping and occasionally ventured into the arts world to 
host a Canadian TV series on songwriters or "tour in some play." The 
</P>
<P>
actor is candid: "I did it for the money then. I do what I do now because I 
love it. Of course, some of the acting I did before, I loved, too. 'Poor 
Richard' by Jean Kerr. And 'Camelot.' Ah. But that's out of my life now -- 
doing musical comedy." 
</P>
<P>
Harrison, born in London and raised in England, France and Switzerland, does 
not shy away from the subject of his famous father, Rex Harrison. Actually, 
it's hard to avoid. Fifteen years ago, Harrison accepted an offer to play Henry 
Higgins in a Boston staging of "My Fair Lady" and has done "probably 15 
productions" since, three in the past year. If the earlier part of his life -- 
as an international club singer and English ski champion -- staved off 
comparisons to his father (that is, "not having to be whom I refer to as 'Wreck 
Junior' "), stepping into the famous role made them inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
So why do it? 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, I had no work; I'd just had these new kids -- twins -- and they 
offered me a lot of money to do it," the father of five said with a shrug. "I 
thought, 'How can I turn it down?' I called Wreck Senior and told him they'd 
offered me this job. He said, 'Why not? Everyone else is doing it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The younger Harrison hastens to add that it's not as uncomplicated as it 
sounds: "He does have a proprietary sense about the part, and even a 
proprietary sense about being an actor. He never wanted me to be an actor. And 
when I started, I didn't, either." 
</P>
<P>
Still, doesn't it feel like the "My Fair Lady" offers come for the wrong 
reasons? 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," he said lightly. "They're asking me because it's good publicity, 
name value, curiosity bringing people in. It's my father's part; that's why I 
hope never to do it again. I see Frank Sinatra Jr. doing his dad's songs and 
think, 'Poor guy.' And then I come on stage as Henry Higgins and hear people 
saying, 'Oh, he looks like his father.' They're not paying attention to the 
play, only to the family resemblance. . . . So I do the best job I can, try to 
make it my own." He laughed ruefully. "But you can't." 
</P>
<P>
Harrison's new-found professional transition -- marked by his move to Los 
Angeles six months ago -- coincides with a personal transition: the end of his 
second marriage. "We just started to go in different directions about the way 
we wanted to live our lives," he said. "When we actually broke up, I was in 
Montreal doing 'Jacques.' It's been nice doing the play, because everything I 
feel can go into it, find a place to hide. So the show is part of wanting to 
rebuild my career, make a living, send my kids to college -- all those normal 
things." 
</P>
<P>
So far, so good. "It's an absolutely ecstatic time," he said, citing the 
positive reviews that have rolled in -- not one mentioning his father. "The 
wonderful thing about the last two weeks is that people have been coming out of 
the woodwork that I haven't seen in 25 years. I always wanted to be an artist, 
but my art was in my singing. I always wanted to be a writer, and now I'm 
writing a play." 
</P>
<P>
Autobiographical? "Of course," he said with a grin. "It's about a man coming to 
terms with his masculinity. One side of him is the raconteur; the other is a 
shy, nervous man not quite sure about his relationships with all the women in 
his life -- from his mother on down. You know, when I do 'Jacques,' it's always 
cathartic for me. I cannot go by the line, 'When you're clever and slick, it's 
a mortal sin' without thinking, 'Am I being slick?' There are lines I 
deliberately wrote into this play so that I'd have to confront my own risk and 
passion." 
</P>
<P>
He downplays any such nobility in his earlier days. "It's like when I used to 
ski, and people would say, 'How do you do that?' Well, if I were really being 
brave, I'd be winning. I was just doing enough to have fun and get away with 
it. That's the way I saw myself then." For "Jacques," though, risk has been an 
energizing factor -- as was the prospect of putting himself on the line in this 
high-profile town. "Bad reviews wouldn't have stopped me," Harrison said 
firmly. "Maybe they'd put me in the toilet. So what? I'd just do something 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 "Adieu, Jacques...!" plays Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m. at Theatre/Theater, 
1713 Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood, through Dec. 22. Tickets are $13. For

Declaring that "assault rifles are built for one purpose -- to kill people," 
Gov. Michael S. Dukakis signed legislation barring their sale or possession in 
Boston and called for a statewide and national ban. "They belong on 
battlefields, not in our schools or on the streets of our cities," Dukakis said 
during a ceremony at a Boston police station that has been in the heart of the 
city's battle against drugs and gang violence. The law, which takes effect 
immediately, imposes fines of up to $1,000 and 2 1/2 years in prison.

Two Fresno County sheriff's deputies and a former deputy are suing the 
department and the county, charging they were discriminated against when they 
were passed over for promotion. Deputies Linda Lee, Joe Rascon and former 
deputy Pete Chavez charged that they were passed over for promotion to sergeant 
because Lee is a woman and Rascon and Chavez are Latinos. Their suit seeks 
recovery of lost wages and damages. The suit follows a determination last 
summer by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that the three were 
discriminated against by the county and the Sheriff's Department in violation 
of the federal Civil Rights Act. Lee, Rascon and Chavez were passed over for 
promotion in favor of Anglo males or others who ranked lower.

Patrons of a predominantly Latino nightclub in San Francisco sued immigration 
officials, contending they were harassed and intimidated when agents raided the 
club in search of illegal aliens. Shortly before midnight on July 22, about 20 
agents of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and the state 
Alcoholic and Beverage Control Bureau sealed the exits to Club Elegante, 
searched and handcuffed some of the 150 patrons and demanded identification or 
proof of citizenship from others.

NAMES NEW BUT GROWTH LOOMS AS VOTE RERUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's worse than a cap. It's an absolute stone wall blockade for development of 
any more housing. And they apply it throughout the community." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Herb Cawthorne, co-chairman of the San Diego 2000 Committee, on rival 
Planned Growth Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative's "intent is not to solve problems. It is simply to obfuscate, 
to confuse and to defeat." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Peter Navarro, chairman of Prevent Los Angelization Now!, on rival Traffic 
Control and Comprehensive Growth Management Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Haven't we heard this before? 
</P>
<P>
The organization names have changed, and the ballot measures are new, but like 
the actors in some bizarre "Twilight Zone" episode that never ends, builders 
and growth-control activists are back on the streets, jockeying for position in 
an election six months away. 
</P>
<P>
Just 13 months after the construction industry clobbered four slow-growth 
measures in the November, 1988, election, both sides are circulating petitions 
to place rival measures on the June 5 ballot in yet another attempt to grapple 
with San Diego's growth. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are new twists this time. On Friday, Mayor Maureen O'Connor 
positioned herself behind the growth-control advocates, urging her colleagues 
to adopt their initiative as city law and strengthen environmental restrictions 
when they meet to consider both ballot measures Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
With an environmentalist majority now seated on the council, a head-to-head 
contest at the polls could be precluded if the council goes along with O'Connor 
or adopts parts of both initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of working for the defeat of the ballot measures, the building industry 
has written one this time. Last year, the San Diego City Council and county 
Board of Supervisors sponsored two of the ballot initiatives; this year, there 
are no plans for either panel to put a measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But much of the overall plot already is shaping up as a rerun of 1988. Expect 
more nasty, personal rhetoric about growth control and the people behind each 
ballot measure, particularly from Navarro and Cawthorne, whose vehemence was 
unrestrained during last year's contest. Expect the builders to spend a good 
deal of money (they spent nearly $3 million in 1988) and the poorly financed 
slow-growthers to seek all the free media attention they can get. 
</P>
<P>
And expect growth-conscious city of San Diego voters to be confused, perhaps 
until shortly before they walk into the booth and vote on the sixth and seventh 
growth-related ballot measures they have faced since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, these (initiatives) are different from 1988," said Tim O'Connell, 
land-use adviser to Mayor Maureen O'Connor. Last year's battle "was more 
focused on the numerical limit issue, whereas these are more oriented toward 
imposing some requirements that solutions be found." 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 face-off pits Prevent Los Angelization Now!, successor to Citizens for 
Limited Growth, against the newly formed San Diego 2000 Committee. PLAN is 
circulating its "Planned Growth Initiative" solely in the city of San Diego, 
whereas the San Diego 2000 Committee is attempting to qualify "Traffic Control 
and Comprehensive Growth Management" initiatives for both city and county 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Circulators hit the streets with the San Diego 2000 Committee's citywide 
initiative Monday, a week after signature gathering for the county ballot 
measure began. PLAN says it has collected 10,000 of the 51,000 signatures it 
needs to qualify for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
PLAN is made up largely of the core group that led Citizens for Limited 
Growth's failed effort to cap housing construction in the city and county last 
year. It is headed by University of San Diego academic Peter Navarro and 
includes UC San Diego professor Richard Carson, environmentalist attorney Leo 
Wilson, San Diegans for Managed Growth leader Bob Glaser and others. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego 2000 Committee is co-chaired by former state Sen. Jim Mills, now 
chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Development Board and former Urban League 
President Herb Cawthorne, neither of whom has direct ties to the building 
industry. Cawthorne is a vice president of the Greater San Diego Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
That choice of leaders obscures the fact that the initiative is largely a 
product of the building industry. According to Cawthorne and Mills, who helped 
develop the document, main contributors include Kim Kilkenny, formerly 
legislative counsel for the construction industry and now an employee of the 
Baldwin Co., a major home construction firm; Greg Smith, Baldwin's president; 
and Mike Madigan, an executive with the Pardee Construction Co., another major 
homebuilder. None of the three returned phone calls to their offices last week. 
</P>
<P>
Don Faye, vice president of Home Capital Corp., the real estate arm of HomeFed 
Bank, also acknowledged offering suggestions on the initiative and said that it 
was circulated to a wide range of concerned groups. 
</P>
<P>
The committee has hired Jean Andrews, political consultant for the local 
construction industry, who organized the builders' controversial 1988 campaign 
against the four slow-growth measures. 
</P>
<P>
Neither initiative includes the numerical caps on home construction that were 
so controversial last year, and very little attention is given to preserving 
hills, wetlands and other sensitive environmental topography that formed a 
major portion of the 1988 initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
The builders initiative, however, includes a "killer clause" that provoked much 
debate last year. Under its terms, if the competing city initiatives each 
receive more than 50% of the vote, the one with more votes wins. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro claims that inclusion of the clause proves that the San Diego 2000 
Committee is interested primarily in defeating PLAN's measure. Mills countered 
that the measures are so incompatible that it would be senseless to try to 
enact both, or even parts of each measure, if both are approved by voters. 
</P>
<P>
Even though they have been on the street just a few weeks, friction between the 
sides already is developing. Jerry Mailhot, who is leading PLAN's petition 
effort, claims that by paying a higher rate, the San Diego 2000 Committee has 
been able to siphon petition circulators away from his firm, forcing PLAN to 
rely on volunteers to qualify the measure for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
When some of those circulators showed up for organizational meetings advertised 
by Jane Kingsley, president of the San Diego 2000 Committee petition group, 
they found that the petitions were not yet available, Mailhot charged. He 
claims that Kingsley was merely attempting to keep PLAN circulators off the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
Kingsley denied the charge, saying that the initiative petitions sometimes are 
held up by unavoidable circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego 2000 Committee says that its initiatives will raise at least $643 
million, and perhaps more than $1 billion, over the next 20 years to build 
roads, freeways and mass transit lines "needed to reduce the traffic congestion 
choking San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
The money, which would be generated by fees on development, is targeted toward 
completion or improvement of major roadways such as California 52, California 
125, Interstate 905 and California 78, plus expansion of the trolley and rail 
systems. It also requires builders to provide roads, schools, parks and other 
infrastructure at the time a new development opens. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego 2000 Committee city initiative establishes a goal of having no 
more than 55% of motorists driving to work alone by 1996; calls for mandatory 
use of reclaimed water in new developments, water conservation, water and air 
quality assurance plans and the reservation of land for child care sites. In 
the city of San Diego, it establishes as a goal recovering 50% of all 
recyclable waste via curbside pickup within seven years after passage of the 
measure. It requires the county to establish a curbside recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
"Ours is a proposal which is designed to finance (solutions to) the problems of 
growth that haven't been addressed in the past," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Connell, the mayor's land-use adviser, said that the initiative consists 
almost entirely of goals that are less ambitious than those already set by the 
city, particularly in the areas of traffic control and curbside recycling. "Our 
existing goal is larger than what they're proposing us to target in seven 
years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it is unclear, O'Connell said, whether the initiative's 
requirement of a developer's fee of no more than $200 per "average daily trip" 
made by the residents of each new home will provide more money for road 
construction than the city receives through its current system of negotiating 
development agreements with builders. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the (San Diego) 2000 (Committee) one does anything," O'Connell 
said. "It requires the city to do this and the city to do that, but it doesn't 
require anyone else to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
Although it also focuses largely on traffic, The Planned Growth Initiative 
takes an entirely different approach to what it now calls "managing" growth. It 
establishes citywide minimum standards for traffic congestion, and requires any 
new development project that would add to traffic to ease the impact by 
improving the transportation system, changing the development, phasing 
construction of the development over time or paying fees to the city in 
proportion to the extra traffic that would be added. 
</P>
<P>
Where traffic already is worse than the citywide standard, the council would 
have to make a finding of pre-existing deficiency and the new development could 
not add to the deficiency, according to Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
It also requires the city to establish minimum standards for provision of 
jails, schools, fire stations, libraries, sewage treatment, trash disposal 
facilities, parking and open space. New development could only occur if such 
facilities were available at the time a project goes up, or, if that is 
impossible, the city enacts a plan to address the deficiency and the developer 
pays a full proportionate share of providing those facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The measure mandates that existing residents shall not pay higher fees to 
provide infrastructure and services required by new development. It calls for 
the city to demand water conservation and water reclamation measures by 
developers, drastically restricts development in the areas around three city 
reservoirs and exempts housing for the poor from its requirements. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell, who generally favors the PLAN initiative, said that he believes that 
it could force the council to deny building permits in an area where traffic 
congestion is extremely bad. 
</P>
<P>
"It's feasible," he said, "that the effect of this language is that in some 
areas that are so congested, and there are no mitigation measures . . . the 
council would be required to deny the project." 
</P>
<P>
Janet Fairbanks, a principal planner with the city's Planning Department, said 
that one fault of the PLAN measure is that it rigidly applies the same traffic 
congestion standard throughout the city, without taking into account the 
varying levels of congestion in different neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that it's really very rigid and it's not flexible. In a community that 
is heterogeneous like San Diego, it needs to be more flexible," Fairbanks said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WORKER KILLED; TRIED TO HALT RESTAURANT HOLDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aparking attendant was shot to death while trying to prevent a robbery at the 
restaurant where he worked, Los Angeles police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The attendant, whose name was withheld pending notification of relatives, was 
trying to stop two men from robbing the Queso Grande Cantina in the 8400 block 
of Reseda Boulevard, said Officer Susan Clemer. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 customers were inside the restaurant about 11:40 p.m. Friday when the 
robbers entered, Clemer said. One of the men went behind the bar and took money 
from the cash register while the other took a female customer's purse, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The unarmed parking attendant spotted the holdup in progress, tried to catch 
one of the robbers and was shot, Clemer said. He was taken to Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects fled the scene before police arrived and were still at large, 
authorities said.

By BRIAN BENNETT , Brian Bennett is principal of Blessed Sacrament Catholic 
School in East San Diego, and is the father of two girls, ages 8 and 11. He has 
been a visiting professor in the schools of education at San Diego State 
University and the University of San Diego.

All of these people understand something that is very basic and logical: that 
if you own this child at an early age, you can own this child for years to 
come. . . . Companies are saying, 'Hey, I want to own the kid younger and 
younger and younger.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Searles, president of Kids 'R' Us 
</P>
<P>
With about 4,000 days of the 20th Century remaining, we have come face to face 
with the truth of at least one old adage -- "Clothes make the man," or, in less 
chauvinistic language more in tune with the economics of the children's 
clothing market, "Clothes (with proper advertising budgets and correct market 
positioning) make (so long as we can convince them through media and pressure) 
the child." 
</P>
<P>
To extend the logic, the child who is "made" is certain to be more accepted, 
more popular and, socio-economically at least, perceived to be better off. It's 
a simplistic logic that preys on precisely those fears that mark adolescent 
life. It should sadden us greatly that this economic victimization of children 
is occurring. It should shock us more that at least some parents fall prey to 
the same temptation -- believing, I suppose, that brand-name status somehow 
equates with successful parenting. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder at times when we can expect the list of popular first names of 
children to expand so that Reebok, Bugle Boy, Jordache and Esprit will rank 
right up there with Michael, Monica, Annie and James. 
</P>
<P>
But there is something we can do to lessen the influence of Madison Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Parents can claim their proper role as parents and demand of their schools -- 
public and private -- that children adhere to a strict dress code. This would 
create at least one environment in which what one wears is secondary to what 
one learns -- an elementary principle that this elementary principal has found 
contributes to academic and developmental success. 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, children should be in uniform when they go to school. 
</P>
<P>
When critical thinking skills are used to determine what label is being worn by 
the student in the next row, legitimate education is impaired. When recess and 
lunch discussion center on itemized analysis of what the "in" group is wearing, 
student focus is distorted. By removing the clothing distraction, parents can 
ensure that at least one non-educational element is removed from the thinking 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Uniforms also save money. At Blessed Sacrament elementary school in East San 
Diego, one child's uniforms -- skirts or jumpers and blouse for girls and 
slacks and shirts for boys -- will generally not exceed $100 per year -- even 
if parents choose to purchase the non-mandatory accessories. I shudder at the 
financial burden that families in non-uniform schools must endure, and, as the 
father of two girls, I secretly rejoice in July and August when I can walk by 
the many back-to-school "sales." 
</P>
<P>
In an age of competing economic ability, children from lower-income homes, and 
even middle-income homes, would be at least sartorially equal in the minds of 
their fellow students if all wore uniforms. The promotion of values based on a 
positive self-concept and rooted in the premise that all children do have an 
opportunity to be equal would serve any school well. 
</P>
<P>
Uniforms would also help eliminate the "color conspiracy" in neighborhoods with 
gang activity. There would be fewer school assaults based on gang clothing 
identification and less psychological intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
But the main reason for uniforms is that they promote discipline, which in turn 
helps improve academic performance. 
</P>
<P>
Blessed Sacrament eliminated uniforms for a while in the 1970s, but returned to 
them at the parents' strong request. Now students have a free-dress policy that 
allows the student council to set the dress code one day a month. The uniform 
policy is reviewed every year by the parent-teacher group, and, predictably, 
each year the student council asks for a free-dress policy. 
</P>
<P>
But our teachers have found that discipline is better on days when students are 
wearing uniforms. On free-dress days, students are less attentive, they talk 
more in class, and they are more boisterous -- not because of some new-found 
freedom from the assumed restrictions on self-expression that uniform-wearing 
schools are frequently accused of, but rather because there is a less serious 
attitude in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
In conversation with students from our school, the amount of time they spend 
trying to decide what to wear on free-dress days comes up frequently as a topic 
of stress. Their parents make the same comment -- and they say the amount of 
time a child takes deciding what to wear increases geometrically with age. 
Would that all of that time could be spent buying back a few precious moments 
of the family intimacy that 20th-Century America makes so impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Blessed Sacrament is the largest Catholic elementary school in the city of San 
Diego, with 418 students in preschool through the ninth grade. It's an urban 
campus where 30% of the students come from single-parent homes, and, in 93% of 
the families, the single parent or both parents work outside the home. Forty 
percent of the students are from other than Anglo ethnic groups. And 25% of our 
students come from families poor enough to qualify for free or reduced-price 
school lunches. 
</P>
<P>
It's a socioeconomic makeup in which academic standards can often be hard to 
meet. Yet at Blessed Sacrament, standardized test scores are 30 to 40 points 
above the national average. 
</P>
<P>
I would be the first to admit that the presence of the uniform policy is not 
the only secret of our students' success, but without uniforms I believe they 
would not perform as well academically. 
</P>
<P>
Oh -- as to Mr. Searles: You don't "own" my children.

As a Native American and citizen of San Diego County, I wish to comment on the

I find myself speaking words that go against Campo's tribal chairman. Yet, as

REJECTED PLAN FOR CONDOS IS RESURRECTED IN SMALLER FORM; 
</P>
<P>
SAN PEDRO: DEVELOPERS HAVE SCALED DOWN THE SIZE OF THE BARTON HILL SENIOR 
HOUSING PROJECT. BUT THE NEW PLAN HAS ALREADY RUN INTO OPPOSITION FROM CITY 
PLANNERS.

<P>
A hotly contested plan to develop condominiums in San Pedro's Barton Hill 
neighborhood, killed six months ago by the Los Angeles City Council, is once 
again working its way through the city bureaucracy, this time in scaled-down 
form. 
</P>
<P>
Developers George and Michael Tumanjan, who failed to win zoning approval to 
build 100 condominiums and 68 rental units for low- and moderate-income senior 
citizens, have resurrected their project as an 88-unit condominium complex. 
</P>
<P>
The new proposal, which calls for two 44-unit buildings to be built on 3.09 
acres at 515 N. Beacon St., will still require approval from the Los Angeles 
Planning Commission and the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan has already run into opposition from the city planning staff, 
which has issued a preliminary recommendation of disapproval. But Gary Booher, 
the city planner who will conduct a public hearing on the proposal Tuesday, 
said the staff, which will make a recommendation on the project to the Planning 
Commission, may change its views after hearing further testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The Tumanjans are asking officials to change the zoning of their property from 
manufacturing to RD1.5, a residential designation that allows one apartment per 
1,500 square feet of lot space. Booher said the staff has reservations about 
the density of the project and whether the site is appropriate for a 
residential development. 
</P>
<P>
As did the earlier proposal, the new plan is likely to spark fireworks in the 
Barton Hill neighborhood, which has long been home to San Pedro's low- and 
middle-income population. Community leaders have complained that condominiums 
will undermine the stability of Barton Hill and prompt the "yuppification" of 
their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The scaled-down plan, however, pokes holes in two of the three arguments that 
residents used to defeat the first proposal: that the project was too dense and 
that the Beacon Street site is a poor place for senior citizens to live. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents say they will continue to fight the Tumanjans on the basis that their 
project would take away land zoned for manufacturing in a community that needs 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Uller, executive director of Toberman Settlement House and a leader of 
the opposition, noted that the Barton Hill Master Plan says all land zoned for 
manufacturing should remain that way "because that brings good jobs to our 
community. That's going to be our big point now." 
</P>
<P>
The Barton Hill Master Plan, however, is not city law. It was drafted by UCLA 
graduate students who studied the area for a class project and hasn't been 
adopted by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The Tumanjans couldn't be reached for comment. But in his application for the 
zoning change, Michael Tumanjan argued that a switch from manufacturing to 
residential zoning is appropriate and "provides a logical transition between 
the limited industrial and existing residential" uses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The application notes that the 515 Beacon St. site is bordered on the west 
entirely by residential uses. 
</P>
<P>
But Booher, the city planner, said the topography of the land actually lends 
itself more to commercial or industrial uses than residential. Because the 
western boundary of the lot slopes severely, all the residential properties sit 
on a hill above the Tumanjans' lot, while nearby industrial properties are on 
the same plane as the condominium site. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Booher said the Planning Department staff has questioned whether 
the density of the project is "significantly lower" than that of the original 
168-unit proposal that was turned down in June. "This has been considered 
before," he said.

LAWNDALE PARKS COMMISSIONER OUSTED OVER POLITICAL MAILER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At the recommendation of Mayor Sarann Kruse, the Lawndale City Council voted to 
remove Ronald V. Maxwell from the Parks and Recreation Commission because of a 
mailer he sent, which some city officials have said was misleading. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell -- who accused Kruse of exercising a personal vendetta against him -- 
was removed from his appointed position on a 3-2 vote Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Kruse, Councilwoman Carol Norman and Councilman Dan McKenzie voted to remove 
Maxwell, while Councilmen Harold E. Hofmann and Larry Rudolph opposed the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Kruse blasted Maxwell for sending a mailer that encouraged Lawndale residents 
to vote in last month's municipal elections. She said that by including his 
title as commissioner in a mailer he paid for, Maxwell falsely led recipients 
to believe that he was speaking for the city or the whole commission. 
</P>
<P>
The one-page mailer, which was sent to about 800 residents, included a picture 
of Maxwell with a headline that said "Commissioner Ron Maxwell Encourages You 
to Vote." It described the issues on last month's ballot and included space to 
request additional information on initiatives and school board candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell was also criticized last month by his colleagues on the Parks and 
Recreation Commission, who voted unanimously to recommend that Maxwell be 
removed because the mailer was misleading. Maxwell did not attend that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell, who opposed Kruse in the 1988 mayoral campaign, defended his mailer 
Thursday night to the council, saying: "There was nothing legally wrong with my 
mailer." 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old aerospace worker prompted cheers from several supporters in the 
audience when he borrowed from a John F. Kennedy speech by saying: "I asked not 
what my community could do for me but what I could do for my community." 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell also came under fire in July, when Kruse unsuccessfully sought to 
dismiss him for a questionnaire he mailed to residents asking their opinion on 
city recreational facilities and needs.

<P>
The Centinela Valley Union High School District Board of Trustees has 
unanimously rejected a defamation and emotional distress claim that was filed 
against the district Oct. 27 by a Hawthorne High School track coach and 
business teacher. 
</P>
<P>
In the claim Kye Courtney, a 20-year district employee, charges that, among 
other things, Supt. McKinley Nash led a conspiracy intended to ruin Courtney's 
reputation by spreading slanderous rumors. 
</P>
<P>
The claim was rejected by the board during a special meeting Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Named in the claim are the district; the school board; Nash; former board 
member Aleta Collins; Dorothy Williamson, a job placement counselor, and 
Stennis Floyd, an activist in Hawthorne. Courtney is seeking $6 million from 
each of the individuals. 
</P>

In interviews shortly after the claim was filed, all four individuals named in 
the claim and an attorney representing the district strongly denied the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
With his claim rejected, Courtney now has six months to file a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Courtney said in an interview that he was harassed and slandered because of his 
popularity among teachers and parents and because he supported the ouster of 
Nash and opposed the reelection of three ardent Nash supporters in last month's 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
"They want me out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Courtney, who is white, alleges in the 21-page claim that Williamson and Floyd, 
both members of the Black Heritage Assn., telephoned the mother of a track team 
member in September and falsely told her that Courtney is a member of the Ku 
Klux Klan and owns a bar in Hawthorne where Klan meetings are held. Courtney 
said he believes the Black Heritage Assn., which is based on the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula, is being used by Nash for his political benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Courtney said he has never belonged to the Klan and that he does not own a bar, 
although he said he patronizes a bar in Hawthorne that is owned by a friend of 
his. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson denied the charges but declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd dismissed the allegations and said that the main objective of the Black 
Heritage Assn. is to improve education. "This group is only here to help the 
children. That's all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nash said he has taken no part in any campaign to defame Courtney, and has had 
no contact with him since naming Courtney acting assistant principal of 
Hawthorne High School last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Other than that, I have no knowledge of Mr. Courtney," he said. ". . . . I 
think he ought to re-examine what he is saying." 
</P>
<P>
Collins, who lost a bid for reelection to the board last month, declined 
comment, referring questions to the district's lawyer, Melanie Lomax. 
</P>
<P>
Lomax said the claim was a thinly veiled attempt by Courtney to embarrass the 
administration and the board members who were running for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
"The timing of this is such that you cannot ignore the connection with the 
November election," she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Courtney asserted that the filing of the claim shortly before the Nov. 
7 elections was coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
The claim, which was presented to the district 12 days before the Board of 
Education elections, was filed at a time of heightened racial tension in the 
district. There has been continuing friction between the district's 
predominantly white teachers' association and some minority administrators, who 
have been hired and promoted by Nash since he became superintendent in 1984. 
The district's students are predominantly Latino. 
</P>
<P>
A former dean of students, Courtney is best known in the district for leading 
the high school track team to seven straight state championships and 11 CIF 
Southern Section divisional championships in the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
He insisted that he is not a racist and said that he has worked with black 
track members for years and has never been accused of racism by the students or 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if a kid is black, blue or polka-dotted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Courtney's claim names the district and the board because Courtney alleges 
Nash, Collins and Williamson were acting as agents of the school district in 
the alleged conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Ku Klux Klan allegation, the claim charges that the effort 
to defame Courtney includes an incident in June, when he applied for the 
permanent position of assistant principal. Courtney held the post for a year on 
a temporary basis. 
</P>
<P>
The claim alleges that Assistant Principal Lucia Peele told a member of the 
selection panel that Hawthorne High School Principal Ken Crowe opposed the 
selection of Courtney. Courtney did not get the job. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Peele denied the allegation and declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
Courtney also alleges that Collins told reporters at a school board meeting 
that he was gathering campaign funds for her opponents by "spreading racist 
allegations." 
</P>
<P>
Courtney acknowledged that he told a group of teachers to support the 
challengers and to give $1,000 to their campaigns "if you hate (the incumbents) 
enough." But he said he never raised the issue of race when he asked for 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
At the time the claim was filed, Lomax, the district's lawyer, characterized it 
as an attempt to divert attention from allegations that Courtney may have been 
involved in illegally recruiting track members from adjacent districts. 
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Oct. 31, Nash said officials at the Inglewood School 
District filed a complaint that prompted the Centinela district to investigate 
alleged recruiting violations at Hawthorne High School. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Lomax said she has investigated the allegations and 
issued a report to the board concluding that "there appears that there have 
been instances of illegal recruitment activity." Asked if the report implicates 
Courtney, she said she could not discuss that. 
</P>
<P>
She said the violations consisted of instances in which "the records of the 
school district appeared to have been falsified" to show that certain track 
team members lived within the district when, in fact, they did not. 
</P>
<P>
Lomax said it is now up to the school board members and the superintendent to 
decide what to do about the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"They are at this point trying to assess responsibility for what . . . appear 
to be clear violations," Lomax said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview a month ago, Courtney said: "No one has ever accused me of 
illegal recruiting. You can call anyone at the CIF." 
</P>
<P>
Dean Crowley, associate commissioner of the California Interscholastic 
Federation's Southern Section, said that in the past five years the CIF has 
investigated at least three complaints of illegal recruitment at Hawthorne High 
School. But, he said, "nothing has ever been proven." 
</P>
<P>
He added that it is normal for a successful athletic program to prompt 
complaints from rival schools of illegal recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
As for the allegations being investigated by the Centinela school district, 
Crowley said he has not been notified about any investigation -- which he said 
would be the regular procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any investigation. . . . You would suspect we would be 
informed," he said.

TOWNHOUSE OWNERS OK SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Rondell Condominium Homeowners Assn. in Agoura Hills on Saturday 
approved a $4.9-million out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit that will pay for 
repairs of an eroded hillside damaged during a rainstorm more than six years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners approved the settlement 65 to 1 at Agoura Hills City Hall, said 
an association spokesman, Donald Wiechec. 
</P>
<P>
The steep hillside in Liberty Canyon slumped to within a few feet of the two- 
and three-bedroom townhouses on March 15, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The site since has been protected by a huge swath of plastic tarp, and the 
settlement guarantees its repair even if the cost exceeds the $4.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, negotiated over the past 18 months, ends years of litigation 
involving two homeowners' associations that sued each other, at least five 
insurance companies, the developers of the condominiums and the companies that 
attempted to repair the hillside after another slide in 1978, attorneys said.

CARSON HIRES NEW FINANCE DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months-long protests from the NAACP that blacks are not represented in 
top administrative posts in Carson city government, City Administrator Jack 
Smith has chosen a black woman, Lorraine A. Oten, as finance director. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who is white, said that Oten, 53, who is leaving a position as finance 
director of Lynwood, "was selected solely on her experience and skills." 
</P>
<P>
But he added that he was pleased that Oten would add balance to the 
administrative team. 
</P>
<P>
"It does something to appease a segment of our community who were crying out 
for more representation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Carson city government, four white males and an Asian male are the other 
appointed department heads, and the deputy city administrator is an Asian male. 
The elected city clerk is an Asian female, and the elected city treasurer is a 
white female. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that in filling the position, the city personnel department 
"intensified our efforts to recruit in all segments of society. In the last six 
or seven months, we have made a very diligent effort to get the word out." 
</P>
<P>
Oten, whose salary range is from $60,000 to $77,000, starts works Tuesday.

RELFECTIONS: 'THIS IS A VERY BASIC LEVEL OF CHANGING THE WORLD THAT I'M WORKING 
ON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Caroline Lemke, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every day is Valentine's Day for Andrea Brae. In a season devoted to tinsel and 
bows, Brae has her office decorated with hearts and cherubs. The 
thirtysomething native of Ohio is a professional matchmaker and founder of 
Soulmates in La Jolla. Brae, a former reporter for the Cincinnati Post, started 
her matchmaking career in San Diego 10 years ago by publishing a dating 
magazine for senior citizens. Seeing the need for hands-on matchmaking, Brae 
started Soulmates. Now, she boasts a client list of 1,500 men and women, and 
says about 75% of the singles who come to her end up walking down the aisle. 
Times staff writer Caroline Lemke interviewed Brae at Soulmates in La Jolla 
Village Square, and Bruce K. Huff photographed her. 
</P>
<P>
 When I moved out here, I wanted to do something that would make a 
contribution, so I started publishing "Sweet and Sexy Seniors." After about 
four years of publishing this magazine, I realized if I was going to be a 
philanthropist and really change the world, I needed to take better care of 
myself. 
</P>
<P>
So I stopped everything I was doing and for a month really thought about what I 
wanted to do. I decided my seniors weren't totally pleased with personal ads 
because it's a real shotgun approach to finding a partner, so I became a 
matchmaker for them, and I had outrageous success. I had lots of people getting 
married. 
</P>
<P>
I'm an Aquarian, and I've got this real sense of responsibility about the 
world. I'm here to make the world a better place. My moon is in Libra, which 
means I'm very interested in partnerships and romance. 
</P>
<P>
I have a great deal of compassion for people. I cry frequently in interviews 
when people tell me about their lives. 
</P>
<P>
I'm very romantic and deeply need myself to be in a love relationship for my 
own grounding, so that gives me a great deal of sympathy for people who are 
not. 
</P>
<P>
This is not about getting dates for people. What we do at Soulmates is 
personal, professional matchmaking, which is very different from a dating 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Dating services for the most part are involved with computers and video and 
photographs so, once the client is enrolled, there's no real personal service. 
</P>
<P>
The first thing I do is handpick two people based on all the criteria they give 
me. I go through hundreds of client files and I pull out a file I think is the 
most appropriate match. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think there is any substitute for the intuitive knowing of people, and 
I have personally interviewed all of our clients so I have a million percent 
sense of the client. 
</P>
<P>
It's like a little light goes off in my head. At night, I'll be in bed and I'll 
be thinking about a client and I'll get a sense, "Oh my goodness, this is going 
to be exciting! I've got to introduce these two people." 
</P>
<P>
We want to take these people who are committed and who want to find their 
soulmate and who are expedient and intentional about that and take that 
innocence and enthusiasm and reward that as quickly as possible rather than 
have them run around the mulberry bush. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with meeting people on your own is that you know nothing about that 
individual, and then you get into a relationship and find out certain things 
that, if you knew up front, you would never have gotten involved. 
</P>
<P>
I save people years of running around the mulberry bush. 
</P>
<P>
My vision is the most important thing. There was a time when I had $10 a week 
for food money, when the phone was about to be disconnected, and I couldn't 
afford to pay my printing costs. 
</P>
<P>
But I really believe in myself, despite anything else to the external that 
says, "You can't make it. You can't do this." 
</P>
<P>
The world needs professional matchmakers. We'd have fewer divorces, happier 
marriages, happy children and a happier society. 
</P>
<P>
This is a very basic level of changing the world that I'm working on, but I 
know it makes a difference.

USIU DOESN'T MIND THAT ITS FOES RUN IT UP 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. International University is college basketball's answer to football's 
run-and-shoot. 
</P>
<P>
Whether they're on the road or playing in the downtown community center that is 
their home away from home, the Gulls' frenzied offense never rests. 
</P>
<P>
Defense seems to be an afterthought to the players and Coach Gary Zarecky, who 
relishes the thought of his team being involved in the first major college 
200-point game even if he's on the short end of the score. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to happen ... " Zarecky said. "I would like to be a part of that 
game and I would like my team to be part of it because if somebody scores 200 
on us, I'm convinced we'll score a 180 or more and that's a phenomenal 
thought." 
</P>
<P>
This small, private school (enrollment 3,500) has been at the center of a 
points explosion in NCAA Division I basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"What we try to do is get up and down the floor and teach the kids where the 
best shots are," Zarecky said. "But there's structure to it. There's a method 
to our madness. If kids in our program take bad shots and continue to do that 
... you're out of control. You try to teach them (to play) in a very 
fundamental manner (but) you don't handcuff them." 
</P>
<P>
Two teams, though, can play the offensive game. The Gulls were reminded of that 
Nov. 29 at Oklahoma, where the Sooners, also a running team, pressed them 
mercilessly, forcing 42 turnovers en route to a 173-101 win. Oklahoma set two 
NCAA records -- 97 points in the first half and total field goal attempts 
(147). 
</P>
<P>
Last season, in two meetings against Loyola Marymount, the Gulls and the Lions 
combined for 637 points. 
</P>
<P>
Their second meeting Jan. 31, 1989, ended up with Loyola winning, 181-150, the 
highest scoring Division I game ever. A shot went up every seven seconds during 
the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the Oklahoma game) doesn't shake the belief in what I'm trying to 
accomplish," said Zarecky, 42-75 in five years at U.S. International. "We're 
not going to back away." 
</P>
<P>
But why are the Gulls bringing out all these points and flying in the face of 
college basketball's defensive, low-scoring tradition? 
</P>
<P>
The answer lies in the Gulls' past and their hope for the future. 
</P>
<P>
"There's two things that I hope happen," Zarecky said. "I hope we gain respect. 
... That will come with winning. Number two, I hope I can continue to coach and 
teach offensive basketball because I think that's the ball of the future. The 
game is changing. You've heard people say our defense is our offense. I reverse 
it. Our offense is our defense." 
</P>
<P>
Zarecky came to U.S. International in 1985 after 25 years as a high school 
coach. He inherited a downtrodden program that was 1-27 in the 1984-85 season. 
</P>
<P>
Zarecky: "We thought we found a way that would allow us to compete. And that 
was to put up points -- points are cheap." 
</P>
<P>
In the first year of Zarecky's free-wheeling offense (1985-86), the Gulls led 
the nation in scoring, averaging 90.3 points per game, a jump of nearly 40 
points over the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
But they gave up an average of 99 points and finished that season 8-20. "I sat 
down and I figured there was no worst (defensive) team list," Zarecky said. 
"All there was was the best (offensive team). There we were leading the entire 
nation with North Carolina, UNLV and Syracuse below. We cut that out, and boy, 
did that become a recruiting tool." 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the Gulls averaged 89.3, second in scoring among major 
independents. 
</P>
<P>
The liberated playing style, Zarecky said, became a selling point out of 
necessity. 
</P>
<P>
The school has no arena on its northern San Diego campus. The Gulls play their 
home games 15 miles away at 4,100-seat Golden Hall in the downtown Community 
Concourse. 
</P>
<P>
Players do some of their conditioning by running over the hills and fields on 
campus but they have no practice facility at the school. 
</P>
<P>
They use a leased warehouse in a Poway industrial park to practice. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line, Zarecky said, is that while his style of offense may be 
offensive to college basketball purists, it is entertaining. And, he says, 
basketball is played to entertain people and give players an outlet for their 
talent. "You've got this team coming out of San Diego with drawing power 
because it's being hyped as this phenomenal offensive machine," Zarecky said. 
"We've been packing arenas all over the country."

JIM MURRAY: BIG WHITE HATS FIT GOOD GUYS IN THIS ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hush falls over the arena. The spotlight switches down to the chutes, where a 
2,000-pound Brahma with horns like daggers and hooves like hatchets is 
systematically kicking dents in the iron bars and slamming his massive head 
viciously against the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, from stage right comes sauntering this grizzled old cowboy, 
nonchalantly rolling a cigarette and pushing his ten-gallon hat back on his 
head. It's old Wyatt Murray himself, the Pecos Kid, the roughest wrangler of 
the Old West, a combination of John Wayne and Geronimo, part gunfighter, part 
Indian, all man. They say he killed two renegades selling whiskey to the 
Indians before he was 11. He cleaned up Dodge City, marshaled in the Oklahoma 
Territory, rode shotgun for Wells Fargo and was the dealer in the card game 
where Wild Bill Hickok got shot dead. He had more notches on his own gun than 
Billy the Kid ever had. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a legend in his own time and his faded blue eyes seem to be scanning the 
horizon for smoke signals as he stands on the rodeo tanbark. His sidekick looks 
at him imploringly. "Wyatt, you ain't gonna get on this double-rank 
man-killer!" he pleads. "Why, he's stomped more cowboys to death than a 
stampede in a thunderstorm. He ain't been rode in 15 years and he's throwed 
more people than they have in Wyoming! They got a whole section in Boot Hill 
named after him!" 
</P>
<P>
 Wyatt looks unimpressed. "He just looks like a whole mess of T-bones to me," 
he drawls coldly. "What's his name?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Adolf," the sidekick tells him. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyatt sniffs. "Well, fix up the rigging," he says menacingly. "He's going to 
get rode today. I've put better bulls than this in a slaughterhouse. By the 
time I get through with him, you'll be able to put him in a merry-go-round. 
Kids can get their pictures taken on him. He's throwed his last man. I may ride 
him home tonight. And get him to bring me my slippers." 
</P>
<P>
 People think most sportswriters are frustrated outfielders or quarterbacks. Or 
they really wanted to win the British Open or the middleweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
But actually, most Americans' fantasy is to to be riding the range and 
answering to the name "Buck." The Wild West is the fabric of most daydreams. 
When Europeans think of America, they think of cowboys. They'd rather see the 
OK Corral than the White House, Main Street instead of Wall Street. Our 
national heroes wear Stetson hats and embroidered boots, not three-piece suits 
and attache cases. 
</P>
<P>
The cowboy is the enduring stuff of America's image of itself. Loyal, laconic, 
fair, a tough guy who doesn't act it. Sleeps on a bedroll with the sky as a 
roof and the howl of a coyote as a lullaby. 
</P>
<P>
The rodeo is the last stand of this way of life in our society. And a guy who 
might have no desire to play center field for the Yankees or be in the final at 
Wimbledon likes to think of himself as taming a mustang, throwing and trussing 
a runaway steer, outlasting an enraged bull. It's always 1890 in a rodeo. A 
better time. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Feild probably typifies the rodeo cowboy. A wily old veteran of the 
bronc-riding circuits from the Badlands to the border, he is a cowboy's cowboy. 
He's been on so many bucking horses, he'd probably fall off one that stood 
still. He's been rodeoing for a decade and has more air time than Lindbergh. 
He's been the world champion cowboy (all around) twice, but he never gets the 
notoriety of, say, a Casey Tibbs or a Larry Mahan because, for Lewie -- as the 
rodeo hands call him -- "Yup" used to be an oration. He made Gary Cooper sound 
like a motormouth. 
</P>
<P>
Lewie Feild comes from a long line of homesteaders who threw out the anchor and 
busted sod or raised longhorns in the valleys of Utah in the last century after 
coming west on the covered wagons. 
</P>
<P>
Some kids get turned on to sport when their dads take them to their first 
ballgames. Lewie's grandfather took him to a Fourth of July rodeo when he was 
4, and he saw his first bull ride. He was, so to speak, hooked. He went home 
and began to ride calves around the family ranch till he got old enough to 
break ponies for the roundup. 
</P>
<P>
Rodeo cowboys belong to the self-reliant world of athletes: No coaches to tell 
them what to do from the age of puberty on up. No team buses. No training 
table. Scholarships are given at a few land-grant schools but they're not 
widespread. 
</P>
<P>
They don't get drafted. Nobody holds out any big-money contracts. The most 
Lewie ever made in one year -- one of the years he was the world's best -- was 
$166,042. Placekickers get that a game. 
</P>
<P>
Rodeo cowboys don't have their own planes. Feild travels the circuit in a 
four-wheel-drive Ford truck, sometimes with a camper stuck on the back. He 
stays in cut-rate motels, eats at the counter. Life is just a kind of 
complicated bunkhouse. 
</P>
<P>
There is no equipment manager, no agent. Lewie buys his own saddle, riding 
gear. It's no small item. Saddles cost $1,000, and you wait a year for 
delivery. Saddlemakers are as rare as buggy manufacturers. He even pays to 
compete. Like pro golfers, rodeo cowboys post an entry fee. They make only what 
they earn on horseback -- or bull horn. 
</P>
<P>
They're not even like fighters. They don't get to pick their opponents. The 
stock is chosen by random draw. They never hope they get some palooka. You 
don't make money unless your horse -- or bull -- is a four-legged psychopath. 
</P>
<P>
Lewie would have been one of the favorites in the National Finals Rodeo this 
week at the Thomas And Mack Center in Las Vegas, an event he has won three 
times in the past, except for his second ride last Tuesday night. Feild was not 
tied on the horse, an outlaw named Kingsway, when they sprung the barrier. 
Lewie should have gotten a re-ride, but he hadn't time to grasp the mane rope 
with two hands, the signal of a false start. He was charged with a buck-off and 
given no points, a fatal score in a national final where every cowboy is the 
modern equivalent of the Durango Kid. 
</P>
<P>
You don't ride bareback straight up in the air like an Englishman chasing a 
fox. You lie back on the horse's haunches like a guy in a hammock, the better 
to rowel his neck and cushion the force of his upheavals. It doesn't always 
work. Lewie Feild, like most rodeo cowboys, chronically suffers lower-back 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
It's a hard life, but so was the old Chisholm Trail. It's as American as a 
harmonica around a campfire. But in an era when Swiss bankers and U.S. 
Presidents might show up in Stetson hats and boots, Lewie Feild is the real 
article. Entitled. He's a throwback. He wears the gear because people in the 
Feild family have been wearing it since the days when Sitting Bull was in the 
hills. 
</P>
<P>
He believes he's doing what every red-blooded American boy wishes he was doing. 
Sitting on some blade-backed, fiddle-headed old man-hater who would throw him 
through the roof and his hat and boots with him, if he could. Every guy who 
ever pretended as a kid to be Buck Jones or Yakima Canutt has to be not green, 
but red, white and blue with envy.

RESERVE ADDS OIL AS CREAKY UCLA SPUTTERS, 83-74 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the NCAA approves a proposal by its President's Commission that would reduce 
the number of regular-season basketball games a team can play from 28 to 25, 
matchups such as the one Saturday at Pauley Pavilion between UCLA and San Diego 
probably would be a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
They would hardly be missed. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA fiddled and fumbled before overpowering the outmanned Toreros in the last 
eight minutes of an 83-74 victory before 5,714. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly are interested in winning, but at this time of the season, we are 
not that interested in the score," UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said. "We are a 
developing team, and we want to get ready for the conference." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, UCLA approached the game almost as if it were a scrimmage, 
which, for the most part, is what it resembled. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to look at different combinations, and that can cause some 
inconsistencies," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
The combination that worked best included freshman Mitchell Butler, a reserve 
guard who sparked an 18-4 surge that turned a one-point game into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
Butler started the spurt with a three-point play that gave UCLA a 62-58 lead 
with 7:56 left. He ended it about four minutes later with another three-point 
play that increased the Bruins' advantage to 77-62. 
</P>
<P>
Butler's second three-point play, which capped an 11-0 run, was preceded by his 
spectacular block. He came from the other side of the lane to knock away a shot 
by Craig Cottrell. 
</P>
<P>
Butler retrieved the ball, whipped it ahead to Darrick Martin and took a return 
pass in the lane for a driving layup. 
</P>
<P>
Cottrell fouled him and Butler also made the free throw. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the one guy, when I think about the game, who sticks out in my mind," San 
Diego Coach Hank Egan said of Butler, who had 10 points, five rebounds, three 
assists, two blocks and a steal in 16 minutes. "He really made some plays with 
his talent and quickness. 
</P>
<P>
"He's also got a presence on the floor. He's really an interesting player to 
watch, (though) it's not a whole lot of fun when you're on the other bench. 
</P>
<P>
"But if I was a fan, I'd really enjoy watching him." 
</P>
<P>
If Egan were a fan, he probably wouldn't have cared too much for a game in 
which UCLA shot 43.8%, only slightly improving its worst-in-the-Pacific 10 
Conference shooting percentage from 41.7% to 42.4%. The Toreros made only 
42.9%. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been struggling and that shouldn't happen with the talent we have," said 
forward Trevor Wilson. He followed a strong game last week at Washington State 
(23 points and 16 rebounds) by scoring a season-high 25 points on 10-of-15 
shooting and pulling down 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' Gerald Madkins made four of seven shots, all from three-point 
range, and scoring a season-high 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
Bringing down the Bruins' shooting percentage were Don MacLean, who had 12 
points and eight rebounds but made only five of 17 shots; and Martin, who had 
nine points and nine assists but made only four of 12. 
</P>
<P>
"We missed some shots that I think, later in the year, we're going to make," 
Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
Center John Jerome, a transfer from Arizona State, scored 20 points to lead San 
Diego, which had four other players in double figures, including Cottrell, who 
had 11 points and 10 rebounds; and Gylan Dottin, a 6-foot-5 guard from 
Saddleback High in Santa Ana who had 10 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the highlights, however, were provided by Butler. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an electric player," Harrick said of the 6-5 rookie from Oakwood School 
in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Butler said he was simply trying to prove that he belongs. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get in, you have limited time and you want to produce," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to let the coach know that when you come in, there's not going to be 
a huge slack-off. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, you just want to prove that you're worthy." 
</P>
<P>
Butler left little doubt Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
UCLA improved to 4-0 going into next Sunday's game against Notre Dame (1-3) at 
South Bend, Ind. . . . San Diego, which has been a Division I team only since 
1979 and had never before played a team ranked as high as the 13th-ranked 
Bruins, fell to 2-5 after its fourth straight loss. . . . After being rejected 
by network television, the UCLA-Notre Dame game, originally scheduled for 
Saturday, was moved to Sunday to accommodate Notre Dame, whose players will 
take final exams Saturday. It will be telecast locally on Prime Ticket. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego lost to St. John's, 74-59, last week in New York after trailing at 
halftime, 50-18, but Torero Coach Hank Egan said it would be difficult to 
compare the 15th-ranked Redmen to the Bruins because his players were so 
intimidated by the Big Apple. "We were slightly catatonic back there," he said. 
"Here, we got beat. We didn't come in and just cave in. We tried." 
</P>
<P>
Carlton Gray, a cornerback on the UCLA football team, probably won't join the 
basketball team until after Jan. 1, Coach Jim Harrick said. . . . Among the 
spectators was former UCLA All-American Bill Walton, who is in town for the 
Grateful Dead's three-night stand at the Forum. . . . Junior guard Kevin 
Williams, who started nine games last season and averaged more than 12 minutes, 
has yet to play this season. . . . After playing Notre Dame, UCLA will return 
to play American Dec. 19 at Pauley Pavilion.

PATRICK EWING FULFILLS HIS PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BARNARD, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Patrick Ewing seems to realize that he's ready to be mentioned in the same 
breath with Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan and Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
For four years, Ewing has politely replied to questions about his performances 
with lines like "I'm just trying to help the New York Knicks win games" and "I 
just want to be the best player I can be." 
</P>
<P>
Now the 7-foot center who dominated college basketball in the early 1980s has a 
chance to be the NBA's first Most Valuable Player in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
And Ewing seems to know it. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning the MVP is a goal of mine," he says. "But winning a championship still 
comes first. But that's not just true of me. Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan 
both would say the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
Ewing said he doesn't mind talking about an individual goal because he believes 
he can't win the MVP unless the Knicks continue as a winning team in the 
Atlantic Division. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing well in part because the team is playing well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing has been a solid, but seldom spectacular, player in his first four years, 
averaging from 20.0 to 22.7 points and from 8-9 rebounds each season. 
</P>
<P>
This year, he has been regularly spectacular, defeating any defense the 
opposition puts in front of him. He trails only Jordan in the NBA scoring race, 
averaging 29 points to Jordan's 32. 
</P>
<P>
"If he keeps playing like this, we're playing in June," teammate Trent Tucker 
said, referring to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Ewing scored 20 or more points 52 times in 80 games. In his first 
18 games this season, he's been held under 20 only once, scoring 30 or more 
eight times and 40 or more three times. 
</P>
<P>
"A machine, just a machine," Golden State rookie Sarunas Marciulionis said 
after Ewing had 44 points and 24 rebounds against the Warriors on Nov. 29. 
"Never have I seen something like that." 
</P>
<P>
"If there's any way to stop me, I'm not telling," Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, as Ewing received increased defensive attention as his scoring 
ability improved, he usually responded to double-teams by passing the ball back 
outside. This year, Coach Stu Jackson said, Ewing is still passing in that 
situation, but he also has learned to spin quickly away from the pressure and 
hit baseline shots. 
</P>
<P>
"He's passing out much, much, much more than he has in the past, but his 
teammates have made the commitment to get him the ball more because they know 
they'll get it back if he's double-teamed and can't get a shot off," Jackson 
said. "But he's definitely getting the ball more and getting more shots. Our 
game plan is to get Patrick the ball. That's always our game plan. ALWAYS!" 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, his shots per game have increased from 15 to 20. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to turn and move quick moves more, and if it's not there, I'll pass 
it out," Ewing said. "That's especially true in the fourth quarter when we're 
trying to make things happen and the pace picks up for everyone. I have to try 
to defeat the double-teams in different ways." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia center Mike Gminski, who guarded Ewing for most of the game as he 
scored 32 points in New York's 110-103 victory on Tuesday, said he noticed the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
"He's on quite a roll," Gminski said. "He seems to be shooting that turnaround 
jumper on the baseline very well. That negates the double-team when he's able 
to do it so quickly. They're going to him a lot and he seems to be gaining 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Ewing has been especially effective recently. On a four-game road trip, he 
averaged 35.3 points, 12.8 rebounds and made 64.6 percent of his 82 field-goal 
attempts. He was named the NBA Player of the Week last week and Player of the 
Month for November. 
</P>
<P>
But Ewing believes it's his rebounding that has to improve in order for him to 
attract MVP attention. 
</P>
<P>
His 24 rebounds against the Warriors -- no Golden State player had more than 
five -- were the most by a Knicks player since 1973 and helped push Ewing to 10 
rebounds per game. His career best is 9.3 last season. 
</P>
<P>
With rebounding specialist Charles Oakley on the team, Ewing probably won't 
climb much higher than that. 
</P>
<P>
But he's improved other aspects of his game, increasing his free-throw 
percentage from 72.8 for his career to 84 percent this season and moving up to 
second in the NBA in blocked shots with almost 3 1/2 per game. "You have to 
realize what he does to the opposition's offense when he's not out there," 
Jackson said. "People's eyes light up because the intimidation factor is not 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Ewing also has come a long way in four years in his relationship with the 
media, a consideration since it's a media group that votes for MVP. He's 
generally more giving of his time after games and occasionally drops a joke or 
a few smiles into the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing in New York doesn't hurt," Ewing said. "This is the media capital of 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
With Ewing in the middle, New York also is re-emerging as a basketball capital.

<P>
GAME OF THE DAY 
</P>
<P>
New York Giants (9-4) at Denver (10-3), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV: Channel 2. 
</P>
<P>
This was shaping up as a possible Super Bowl preview until the Giants lost 
their last two games and fell into a tie for the NFC East lead with 
Philadelphia. The Giants beat Denver in the Super Bowl nearly three years ago 
at Pasadena, 39-20, but the Broncos are a different team these days, with Bobby 
Humphrey to go with John Elway on offense and a much stronger defense. The 
Giants have gotten a lot of mileage from Ottis Anderson, but Phil Simms has 
struggled with a knee injury. Lawrence Taylor, who played only a half last week 
with a hairline fracture in his foot, has 12 sacks and should be up for the 
chase against Elway. 
</P>
<P>
INTERCONFERENCE GAMES 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans (6-7) at Buffalo (8-5), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills have lost two of their last three but hold a one-game lead in the AFC 
East because Miami has lost two in row. The Saints seemed headed for the 
playoffs after overcoming a 1-4 start, but have lost two in a row. Buffalo 
figures to muster more offense with Jim Kelly and Thurman Thomas at chilly Rich 
Stadium. Saint Coach Jim Mora replaced struggling quarterback Bobby Hebert last 
week with John Fourcade, who may start. The Bills are 6-1 at home, the Saints 
are 4-2 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City (6-6-1) at Green Bay (8-5), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV: Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
These teams are the two biggest surprises in the NFL this season. The Packers 
are tied with Minnesota atop the NFC Central and Kansas City still is in the 
hunt for a wild-card berth. Green Bay has done it with quarterback Don 
Majkowski, who leads the NFL with 3,719 yards and 24 touchdowns, and a defense 
that has allowed 20 or fewer points in five of the last six games. The Chiefs 
give the ball to Christian Okoye, who has 1,191 yards and 10 touchdowns, and 
leave the rest to the NFL's No. 2-ranked defense. Of Green Bay's 13 games, 10 
have been decided by four points or fewer. The Chiefs are 1-4-1 on the road, 
the Packers are 7-1 at home. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay (5-8) at Houston (8-5), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers lead Cleveland by half a game and Cincinnati by a game in the AFC 
Central, but play the Bengals next week before finishing the season with 
Cleveland. Houston has won three of four games, Warren Moon driving the Oilers 
to Lorenzo White's winning touchdown with 21 seconds left last week at 
Pittsburgh. Vinny Testaverde's nemesis, the interception, cropped up five times 
last week in Tampa Bay's loss to Green Bay. Houston is 5-2 at home. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego (4-9) at Washington (7-6), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers are sticking with rookie Billy Joe Tolliver at quarterback, even 
though he threw for two interceptions and was sacked five times by the New York 
Jets last week. San Diego has some promise on offense with runner Marion Butts 
and receiver Anthony Miller, but has scored more than 20 points just twice this 
season. The Redskins, hanging in the playoff race, have won two straight games 
impressively with Mark Rypien at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
AFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Seattle (5-8) at Cincinnati (7-6), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
After having been benched for two games in favor of young Kelly Stouffer, 
quarterback Dave Krieg led the Seahawks past Buffalo Monday night. The Bengals 
are tied with the Raiders and Miami for the AFC's last playoff spot, but still 
can win the title in the AFC Central. Cincinnati defeated Seattle last season 
in the playoffs at Riverfront Stadium, 21-13. The Bengals rushed for 254 yards 
in that game and will attack Seattle, ranked 24th against the run, with the 
NFL's most productive ground game. James Brooks has gained 1,065 yards this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland (7-5-1) at Indianapolis (6-7), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Kosar's sore elbow sent him to the bench early in the Browns' 21-0 loss 
to Cincinnati last week and backup Mike Pagel could start against the Colts, 
his former team. The Browns are 0-2-1 since ending a four-game winning streak. 
The Colts probably lost out on the playoffs in a 22-10 defeat against New 
England last week. Eric Dickerson has gained at least 1,000 yards for the 
seventh consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
New England (5-8) at Miami (7-6), 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV: ESPN 
</P>
<P>
Miami's playoff chances have been jolted by consecutive losses to Pittsburgh 
and Kansas City after the Dolphins had moved into a tie with Buffalo for the 
AFC East lead. Marc Wilson, starting for the first time in two years, led the 
Patriots past Indianapolis last week. Miami's Dan Marino has passed for 3,208 
yards and 21 touchdowns. The Dolphins ended a seven-game losing streak against 
the Patriots 12 weeks ago, 24-10. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh (6-7) at New York Jets (4-9), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers, after consecutive wins over San Diego and Miami, probably lost 
out on the playoffs last week in a last-minute loss to Houston. Quarterback 
Bubby Brister is a real threat again with his injured knee mended. New York has 
won two in a row for the first time this season, but it may be too late for 
Coach Joe Walton. The Jets beat Pittsburgh last season, 24-20. New York is 1-5 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
NFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Detroit (4-9) at Chicago (6-7), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
If the Bears can beat anybody, it may be the Lions, who have lost 10 in a row 
to Chicago. Detroit, though, is improving by the week, having won three of its 
last four games, against contenders Green Bay, Cleveland and New Orleans. The 
Lions have played well lately with either Rodney Peete, who has a knee injury, 
or Bob Gagliano at quarterback. Chicago has mostly struggled with Mike Tomczak 
or Jim Harbaugh. The Bears beat the Lions 11 weeks ago, 47-27. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta (3-10) at Minnesota (8-5), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings need this one with a Cleveland-Cincinnati finish in their battle 
with Green Bay for the NFC Central title. Atlanta quarterback Chris Miller will 
be chased by Minnesota's front four, which is after the NFL sack record. Keith 
Millard has 16 sacks, Chris Doleman 14, Al Noga 9 1/2 and Henry Thomas eight. 
Atlanta is 0-7 on the road, Minnesota is 6-0 at home. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas (1-12) at Philadelphia (9-4), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Johnson's Thanksgiving Day charges that Buddy Ryan is a bounty hunter 
lend spice to this one. Troy Aikman threw for four touchdown passes last week 
with little pass rush from the Rams, but Reggie White and the Eagles ought to 
pressure him. Philadelphia has beaten Dallas four consecutive times, including 
27-0 on Thanksgiving.

MIKE DOWNEY: MARK HIS WORD, ANGELS TO BE TOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a man who's worth more money than most Anaheim savings and loans, Mark 
Langston still seems a fairly down-to-earth chap. Oh, he looks spiffy enough in 
his wild wide-striped suit and purplish shoes that resemble something Jack 
Nicholson's Joker might wear, and his glamorous wife keeps a diamond on her 
finger that is larger than Anaheim Stadium, but what the heck, when you got it, 
flaunt it. What should these people do -- wear blue jeans ripped at the knee? 
</P>
<P>
Langston looks sharp, feels sharp and talks a good game, too. He wants not to 
make waves, even this close to the ocean. Says he's glad to be an Angel, glad 
to be where it's warm, glad to be making what he's making no matter how much 
more Mark Davis or Robin Yount or anybody else in baseball's Billionaire Boys 
Club eventually commands, and says he's glad to be playing his home games on 
real grass for a change, even though "I'm a pitcher, so I'm always in the dirt 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Outspoken? Not particularly. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest limb Langston ventured onto, at his welcoming party Friday at the 
Big A, was his description of the Angels as "the team to beat" in the American 
League West next season, even with the Oakland Athletics having been to 
back-to-back World Series. That one raised a couple of eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
Langston explains that he and his off-season next-door neighbor, A's outfielder 
Dave Henderson, have been chatting over the back fence about Oakland's need to 
fill voids left by Storm Davis on the mound and Dave Parker in the batter's box 
and clubhouse, which in turn has led Langston to this startling conclusion: 
"The Angels definitely figure to be the front-runners going into the season." 
</P>
<P>
Just wait'll Jose Canseco hears that. Be sure to dial 1-900-JOSE, or whatever 
his number is, any time next week, because Canseco probably will be picking the 
Angels to finish seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind, though, this is neither controversy nor conceit on Langston's 
part. It's enthusiasm. It's a mind-set taking hold. This is Mark Langston 
already getting into the proper mood for the season, getting himself into a 
suitable frame of mind after toiling for ballclubs that stayed away from 
pennant races as though they had incentive bonuses in their contracts not to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a very poor loser," Langston makes a point of saying and later repeating. 
</P>
<P>
He mentions how he gave a great deal of thought to signing a long-term deal 
with the Montreal Expos in the middle of last season, soon after they sent 
three pitchers to the Seattle Mariners on May 25 just to be able to rent him. 
Then something happened to unsettle Langston. 
</P>
<P>
As he recalls: "We hit a skid where we lost seven games in a row, or something 
like that, and I was anxious to see how the team would bounce back. Well, we 
didn't bounce back." 
</P>
<P>
That indicated to him something about the club, about its hunger to win. 
</P>
<P>
Same thing at Seattle. Langston ran into the new owner of the Mariners the 
other day, liked his upbeat attitude, told him it was "too bad he hadn't bought 
the team sooner, because things would be very different right now." 
</P>
<P>
Might he have signed to stay put, had Seattle had more generous management? 
</P>
<P>
"I probably would have signed," Langston said. "I'm just very glad that I 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Spike Owen and I used to talk about it almost nightly in Montreal, why we 
never could win when we were in Seattle together. All you have to do is look 
around the league to understand it. Look at the Oakland A's -- half the team's 
ex-Mariners. You could fill an All-Star team with the players Seattle has let 
go." 
</P>
<P>
Since Langston is eager to please, he answers affirmatively when someone from 
the West Coast asks him if the biggest factor in his free agency was playing 
for a team on the West Coast. As a native Californian, Langston hardly minded 
saying yes. Trouble is, it's untrue. It's a little white lie, no harm intended. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, this is a pitcher who just finished saying how he nearly signed with 
Montreal, or would have stayed in Seattle, given the money. He negotiated with 
the New York Yankees, with the Chicago Cubs, with the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
West Coast, schmest coast. Langston was out for three things: major loot, a 
no-trade guarantee and a five-year warranty. The Angels obliged. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston cost Wayne Gretzky $11 when Gretzky bought his fantasy-league 
baseball team. He cost the Angels $15,999,989 more. 
</P>
<P>
After the Angels outbid seven or eight other teams for the pitcher's services, 
a friend ran into Gretzky at a hockey game. First thing Gretzky said was: 
"Langston!" He was excited. And, as it turns out, the admiration society is 
mutual. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a huge fan of his," Langston says of Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
The two men have certain things in common, not the least of which is a wife 
with a show-biz career. Michelle Langston, much like Janet Jones, has an acting 
career to consider, although Gretzky's lady already has been in several films, 
whereas Langston's wife is a beginner who has merely been taking acting classes 
for a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
"Jackie Autry already has introduced me to some of her friends in the 
business," Michelle Langston said of the Angel owner's wife Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Any specific interests? 
</P>
<P>
"Daytime TV," she said. "A soap would be perfect. It would be nice to have the 
nights free." 
</P>
<P>
After all, there will be baseball to watch in the nighttime. The Angels open 
the season April 9 against -- well, what do you know? -- the Seattle Mariners, 
and even if Bert Blyleven works opening night, you can bet Mark Langston won't 
be far behind. Langston says he doesn't care who's No. 1 or No. 2 or No. 5, 
except that some guys who are told they are No. 5 tend to believe it, and pitch 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
He does have one worry. One big concern. This Blyleven character, he gives 
people hotfoots. He's dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"Last night I had nightmares that Bert Blyleven was going to be underneath this 
podium, with a match," Langston said, during his opening remarks. "That's why I 
wore shoes without laces, so he couldn't get me." 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed that," said Blyleven, who was in the room. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked my shoe company to get me some with non-flammable shoelaces," Langston 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't make 'em!" Blyleven shot back. 
</P>
<P>
Listen, with $16 million in the bank, if you want non-flammable shoelaces, 
somebody out there will make you non-flammable shoelaces.

CLIPPERS: HIGH-SCORING XAVIER MCDANIEL HELPS SEATTLE TAKE EARLY LEAD, THEN IT 
HOLDS ON TO EDGE LOS ANGELES, 104-100.

<P>
The X-factor, of late more prominent in box scores than algebraic equations and 
tougher to solve, presented the Clippers with an especially puzzling equation 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
How to stop a hot forward when two front-court starters, Joe Wolf and Ken 
Norman, are home because of injuries, and another, Danny Manning, is supposed 
to have his time limited to 20 minutes? 
</P>
<P>
X equals problems. In theory and reality. 
</P>
<P>
Doing most of his damage early, which allowed Seattle to build a tenuous but 
insurmountable lead, Xavier McDaniel had 24 points as the SuperSonics edged the 
Clippers, 104-100, before 12,549 at Seattle Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
If moral victories counted, the Clippers, close losers to New York, San Antonio 
and the Lakers, would be NBA champions. Instead, they are 6-11, including 0-7 
on the road. 
</P>
<P>
This time, they came within a few plays of victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not regurgitating comments to say it's a sign of progress," said Coach Don 
Casey, who continues to be critical of officials. "One of these days, somebody 
is going to let us win on the road -- us, the other team. I don't know (who). 
God?" 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers came close on their own. 
</P>
<P>
While having six players score in double figures and Benoit Benjamin grab 14 
rebounds, seven on offense while starting in place of Wolf, the Clippers were 
within eight points heading into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
A 19-10 run soon after cut the Seattle lead to 92-91. The Clippers scored on 
seven of eight possessions during one streak within the run. 
</P>
<P>
But when it mattered most, they got sloppy. Within 96-93 with 2:02 remaining, 
the Clippers committed back-to-back turnovers on bad passes by Gary Grant and 
Ron Harper. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle pushed the lead back to 98-93 on a pair of free throws by Dale Ellis 
with 1:34 left and held on. Ellis finished with a game-high 28 points, 16 in 
the second half, and Michael Cage and Derrick McKey added 15 and 12 rebounds, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Manning picked up some of the Clippers' slack inside with 15 points (13 in the 
final two quarters) and eight rebounds. He also exceeded his 20-minute comeback 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a long 20 minutes, wasn't it?" Manning deadpanned. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how long -- the Clippers say he didn't go a true 31 minutes since all 
time is rounded off -- and what will happen for going against doctor's orders 
will no doubt be determined soon. Casey was in no mood to debate minutes when 
he could seemingly have talked for hours about calls going against his team, 
although he wasn't upset with any one in particular. 
</P>
<P>
He will also have to wait another couple of days to see if Norman (tendinitis 
in a knee and a sore wrist) or Wolf (strained lower back muscle) will be 
healthy enough to join the Clippers Tuesday night at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel came in having scored 36, 26 and 37 points the previous three games, a 
span when he also shot 62.3%. In the first half against the Clippers, against 
whom he averaged 23.2 points in five meetings last season, it was more of the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
With eight points in the first quarter and 10 in the second, McDaniel hit seven 
of nine attempts and led all scorers into intermission. McDaniel also finished 
the half by scoring Seattle's final eight points -- two on a tip-in of McKey's 
miss, four on jump shots and two on free throws -- allowing the SuperSonics 
(11-7) to take a 54-48 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers opened the third quarter by going scoreless for the first 3:12. 
Harper broke that with an eight-foot bank shot from the right side, but that 
only cut Seattle's advantage to 59-50. It reached 63-50, setting the stage for 
a big comeback just to get close. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Quintin Dailey, who spent the last three seasons with the Clippers until his 
option was not picked up, is close to signing with the Sioux Falls Skyforce of 
the CBA. His rights once belonged to Santa Barbara, but the Islanders traded 
him to the South Dakota franchise for a sixth-round draft choice in 1990 -- 
among players not picked in the two rounds of the NBA draft -- and a player to 
be named later. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle center Michael Cage survived last week, which is all anyone could have 
hoped for when the converted forward faced, in order, 7-2 James Donaldson of 
Dallas, 7-0 Patrick Ewing of New York, the depth of the Detroit Pistons' front 
line and 6-11 Akeem Olajuwon of Houston. "It's been pretty stressful lately," 
Cage, a former Clipper, said before the game. "You name him, he's been here."

LATE KICK LIFTS NAVY TO AN UPSET OF ARMY; 
</P>
<P>
RIVALRY: MIDSHIPMEN END CADETS' THREE-GAME WINNING STREAK IN SERIES, 19-17, AND 
SALVAGE FORGETTABLE SEASON.

<P>
Frank Schenk, who missed a chip-shot field goal earlier in the season that cost 
Navy a victory against Delaware, made a 32-yarder with 11 seconds to play, 
giving the Midshipmen a 19-17 upset victory over Army Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The victory ended Navy's three-game losing streak in the series and gave the 
Midshipmen a 42-41-7 lead since it began in 1890. 
</P>
<P>
Navy Coach Elliot Uzelac said he told Schenk after the missed field goal 
against Delaware: "Son, you're going to kick the winning field goal against 
Army." But Uzelac added: "I didn't think it was going to be this week." 
</P>
<P>
Schenk, a junior, said: "I knew (the outcome) was going to be close. As soon as 
the Army kicker made it 17-16, I knew it was going to come down to me. That 
fourth quarter was the longest time of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Uzelac said the victory made up for a 3-8 record that included three losses to 
Division I-AA teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we've had a lousy season and nobody's madder about it than I am," he 
said. "But we beat Army and that takes care of a lousy season." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Mayweather, a junior halfback, broke Army's rushing record. His 84 yards 
gave him 2,960, three more than Glenn Davis compiled from 1943-46. Mayweather 
also finished the season with 1,176 yards, breaking Doug Black's Army season 
record set in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's any consolation to my teammates, I hope they can relish in this record 
as long as I do," Mayweather said. 
</P>
<P>
Army Coach Jim Young said: "I am happy we had a winning season (6-5). It is 
certainly better than having a losing year, but losing today was a big 
disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
Young praised Navy quarterback Alton Grizzard, who converted three fourth-down 
running attempts, including one during the final drive. 
</P>
<P>
Uzelac said he knew going into the game that Navy would have to take some 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided that whatever it was going to take we were going to do," he said. 
"I knew I was going to gamble on some fourth downs." 
</P>
<P>
The final gamble kept the winning drive alive. Grizzard, on a keeper, lunged 
for a first down on fourth-and-two at the Army 35. 
</P>
<P>
Grizzard followed the first down with a 10-yard carry up the middle to the Army 
23. Rodney Purifoy got another eight yards, and Schenk came onto the field with 
11 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Army called time out. Then Schenk erased bad memories of the 10-9 loss to 
Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Delaware game, everyone knew what I was going through," Schenk said. 
"When I went back on the field, I just tried to forget the crowd, to forget it 
was the Army-Navy game. Just to think positive, to kick it like any other 
kick."

GATHERS FAINTS, BUT KIMBLE'S 51 KEEP LOYOLA FROM COLLAPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Loyola Marymount needed the biggest night of Bo Kimble's college career to 
score its biggest victory of the season, knocking off UC Santa Barbara, 
104-101, Saturday night before a sellout crowd of 4,156 at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble scored 51 points, setting a school record and making up for the midgame 
loss of Hank Gathers, who fainted on the court with 13:56 left. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble's outburst helped the Lions (5-1) hold off a late rally by the Gauchos 
(3-2), who trimmed a 20-point deficit to one point in the final minute behind 
Carrick DeHart's 26 points and Eric McArthur's 24. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, who had 18 points, did not return to the game and was taken to 
Centinela Hospital Medical Center for precautionary tests, but team doctor Dan 
Hyslop said Gathers appeared to be fine. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions were also without Jeff Fryer, recovering from an injury, and two 
players fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara dictated a deliberate pace for the first 12 minutes, with Loyola 
failing to score three minutes into the game and UCSB holding a 24-23 lead with 
7:59 to play in the half. 
</P>
<P>
The game proceeded at UCSB's pace until Loyola suddenly kicked it into gear 
and, with Kimble finding his three-point touch, went on a 14-2 run in two 
minutes to build a 46-32 lead. The Lions led at halftime, 54-44. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers scored five straight points in the spurt and Kimble hit three 
three-pointers in the last seven minutes of the half on the way to 26 points at 
the break. Gathers added 13. McArthur paced the Gauchos with 12. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions continued to expand the lead in the second half despite the loss of 
Gathers, stretching it to 20 several times. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos ate into the lead with a late 11-2 run, pulling to within 92-82 
with 6:30 left, and sliced the lead to single figures at the 4:33 mark. 
Consecutive three-pointers by DeHart and Idris Jones trimmed the lead to 98-93 
with 2:42 left. A three-pointer by Paul Johnson and a short jump shot by Gary 
Gray made it 100-98 with 1:44 left. 
</P>
<P>
Two free throws by Kimble were answered by another three-point basket from 
DeHart, making it a one-point game with 56 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos had two chances to take the lead but committed two turnovers in the 
final half minute, and Kimble hit two free throws with 11 seconds left to seal 
it.

CS FULLERTON CAN'T SHED ITS SHROUD OF SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
After three games, Cal State Fullerton was still waiting to find out something 
about its basketball team. No team had played the Titans closer than 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
Tulsa (2-2), a team picked to finish second in the Missouri Valley Conference, 
seemed likely to provide a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
But instead, Fullerton came away with an 84-58 victory Saturday in Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that was the toughest ball game we've played so far," Titan Coach John 
Sneed said. "I thought we had a chance to make a statement against a pretty 
good ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Tulsa made a statement of a sort in the second half, falling into a slump 
during which the Golden Hurricane made only two field goals in the first 16 1/2 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Cornal Henderson finally scored with 4:30 remaining, the score was 
69-46 -- and Fullerton had its fourth victory without a loss. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hill, a senior guard, led Fullerton with 27 points, 20 in the first half. 
Cedric Ceballos, who scored only four in the first half, finished with 21, his 
low for the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans' start is their best since the 1983-84 season, when they started 
5-0. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton will have a chance to match that start next Saturday when it plays 
Cal State Northridge at home. 
</P>
<P>
In games against West Texas State and St. Mary's, Fullerton held only 
three-point leads at halftime, but went on to win by at least 15. 
</P>
<P>
But against Tulsa, the best team the Titans have played, Fullerton led, 41-31, 
at halftime -- even though Ceballos scored only four points and had to sit out 
the final seven minutes because of three fouls. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos came back to start the second half, and helped fire a 10-0 run that 
put Fullerton ahead, 51-33, in the first five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton still isn't set on a lineup. Agee Ward, a sophomore who was 
ineligible under Proposition 48 last season, became the starting power forward 
in the Titans' second game. Against Tulsa, freshman Aaron Wilhite got the first 
start of his career, replacing senior John Sykes at center. There may yet be 
more jockeying for those inside positions, but Ceballos, Hill and Williams are 
set. 
</P>
<P>
The starters stayed in the game until the final minutes despite the margin of 
victory. The first starter to leave the game for good was Ward, who fouled out 
with 2:59 left. Ceballos didn't leave until 2:11 remained. 
</P>
<P>
The only suspense was the question of when Tom Parada, a 5-foot-6 freshman 
walk-on, would get in the game. Sneed makes little secret of the fact that he 
kept Parada to become a crowd favorite, as Parada did instantly. But Parada 
committed four turnovers in four minutes in the Titans' first game. He got into 
the second home game with one minute left, and didn't enter Saturday's game 
until 31 seconds remained.

Most basketball experts expected powerful Patrick Ewing to become a dominant 
force soon after he entered the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
When the 7-0 center of the New York Knicks failed to show any tendency to take 
charge in four seasons, many figured he never would. 
</P>
<P>
They should have waited just a bit longer. 
</P>
<P>
The former Georgetown standout has finally, in his fifth season, become a 
force. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing took over in the third quarter Saturday night at New York, broke open a 
close battle and led his team to a 124-92 romp over the Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics, who beat the Knicks Wednesday night at Boston despite 32 points, 
nine rebounds and three blocks for Ewing, had just pulled to within 49-48 on a 
rally to open the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Nine minutes later, the Knicks were cruising, 81-64. Ewing had scored 19 points 
in the nine minutes and completely turned the game around. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the Knicks a 12-7 record and a 1 1/2-game lead in the Atlantic 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing played 36 minutes, and in the other 27 minutes he had only seven points. 
He also had eight rebounds. Robert Parish, the Celtics' 36-year-old center, got 
in foul trouble trying to stay with Ewing and played only 16 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I did more watching than playing in this game," Parish said. "When I went out, 
Ewing just went crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bird had 25 points and 10 rebounds for the Celtics, who have won only 
three games in the last three years on the road against teams with better than 
.500 records. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 121, Indiana 93 -- The Pistons, still angry over a loss Friday night at 
Philadelphia, took it out on the Pacers at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The upstart Pacers, the surprise of the NBA early season, never had a chance. 
They fell behind early and by halftime were out of it, trailing, 59-38. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons' backcourt of Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars simply took command. 
Thomas had 20 of his 30 in the first half, and Dumars finished with 24. Between 
them they made 25 of their 36 shots from the field. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons ended the Pacers' five-game winning streak and cut their lead in 
the Central Division to half a game. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 125, Philadelphia 105 -- Speaking of players who can control a game, of 
course, brings to mind Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored 15 of his 29 points in the third quarter at Chicago and the Bulls 
coasted to their sixth win in the last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
While Jordan was having a big game, which included nine rebounds and nine 
assists, the 76ers' two big men weren't. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley, recovering from a virus, had only six points and played just 
20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Mahorn, who turned in an emotional performance in the victory over the 
Pistons Friday night, was flat. He was one for five and had eight rebounds in 
27 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 106, Charlotte 93 -- Alex English, who has been complaining about a lack 
of playing time, produced 25 points in 38 minutes at Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets, who have won nine of their last 11 games, led almost all the way 
and handed the Hornets their seventh loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this means I will get more playing time," said English, who was 11 for 
17 from the field. "I know I can still help this club. I'm all excited about 
the way we are playing. When you play an expansion or second-year team, you 
have to keep the pressure on." 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 104, Minnesota 91 -- With his Hawks held even at home for a half by the 
Timberwolves, Dominique Wilkins decided to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins scored seven of his 33 points in a 13-0 run that opened the second half 
as the Hawks won their sixth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 109, New Jersey 92 -- David Robinson continues to play like a 
veteran and the Spurs are hot. 
</P>
<P>
The rookie center had 26 points at San Antonio to lead the Spurs to their sixth 
consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets, who upset Houston Friday night, made a game of it until the third 
quarter, when Robinson had 12 points and the Spurs built an 88-69 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 104, Houston 90 -- The Rockets, who fell apart at home against the Nets, 
didn't improve at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz held the Rockets to eight points in the first quarter and with their 
one-two punch of Karl Malone and John Stockton setting the pace, it was a romp. 
</P>
<P>
Malone had 25 points and 14 rebounds, and Stockton had 16 points and 10 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 108, Sacramento 101 -- Larry Nance came back just in time to help the 
beleaguered Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
Nance, who missed the first 17 games because of foot surgery, scored 12 of his 
14 points in the fourth quarter at Sacramento to bring the Cavaliers from 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers, who are without center Brad Daugherty, had lost five in a row.

ALUMNI, UZELAC UPSET BY NAVY LOSSES TO DIVISION 1-AA SCHOOLS 
</P>

<P>
When Harry Dietz arrived at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium for the game 
against James Madison on Oct. 28, the former Navy quarterback expected a 
festive crowd, an exciting game and -- of course -- a Navy win. 
</P>
<P>
He came to the game frustrated by six straight losing seasons. But it was 
homecoming, which made the 24-20 loss by the Midshipmen to the Division I-AA 
foe harder to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the loss to James Madison was the lowest point of Navy football in the 
history of the school," said Dietz, who played for Navy in 1960. "There's no 
way the Naval Academy should lose to a James Madison or a Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
"Those teams should play close games, but Navy shouldn't lose. Instead, these 
teams dominate Navy." 
</P>
<P>
It's been that kind of a season for the Midshipmen, a year that marked the 
first sweep of Navy by I-AA opponents. Losses to Notre Dame, Pittsburgh and 
Syracuse are to be expected, but dropping games to The Citadel (14-10), James 
Madison (24-20) and Delaware (10-9) -- all I-AA opponents -- have put a damper 
on a season that, in August, Coach Elliot Uzelac looked to with a lot of 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
But Navy's final game is not just a season closer for a losing team -- it's an 
event. The Midshipmen (2-8) battle Army on Saturday and, with a sold-out crowd 
at Giants Stadium and a national television audience looking on, Uzelac 
possibly can rid himself of this season's many disappointments with a win over 
the Cadets (6-4). 
</P>
<P>
A loss would make it four straight to Army, something Navy hasn't done since it 
dropped its fourth straight to the Cadets in the 1947 season. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them (after the Delaware loss) it doesn't really matter what you do in 
the season -- 8 and 2 or 2 and 8 -- when you're preparing for a game like 
this," Uzelac said. "It's a new season, and it's like having three weeks in 
preparation for the first game." 
</P>
<P>
"For us to build for Army, it's like us starting over again," he added. "I told 
them Delaware is behind them, the whole 1989 season is behind them. Now it's 
only Army." 
</P>
<P>
It would have been a lot easier for Uzelac going into the game 5-5. In those 
three losses to the I-AA schools, the Midshipmen fumbled the ball inside the 
10-yard line in each game -- the three losses were by a total of nine points. 
</P>
<P>
"If you keep doing enough things wrong," Uzelac said, "if you don't make the 
plays, the other team's confidence builds and you get socked. (Navy) is a 
better team then the record indicates; I know they are." 
</P>
<P>
Better in Uzelac's eyes, but Joe Bellino, the Navy halfback who won the Heisman 
Trophy in 1960, said recent teams have lacked spark. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm never disappointed when Navy loses to Air Force or Army," Bellino said. 
"But it's frustrating to see us loss to teams like Delaware and James Madison, 
which would normally be sure wins. 
</P>
<P>
"Losing may be an indication of the intensity that hasn't been there the last 
few years," he said. "When I was there, we used to win those games." 
</P>
<P>
Before the start of the season, Uzelac said it was not unrealistic to have a 
winning season, that it was conceivable the Midshipmen could be host in the 
Liberty Bowl (which Air Force is doing, by winning the Commander-in-Chief's 
Trophy) and that the team was within two years of being on equal ground with 
Army and Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
But, somewhere, those expectations bottomed out. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected a lot before the year, but I felt we were not out of the woods 
yet," Uzelac said. "I felt we would be a much better team. I did not expect 
this. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of my worst fears came true that the schedule did create some injuries. 
At some key times, that hurt us. But we still have to play over those. We were 
not good enough to do that. In my opinion, it's been a bad season." 
</P>
<P>
After being blown out by Brigham Young (31-10), the Midshipmen lost at home, 
14-10, to The Citadel -- the second straight year the Division I-AA school has 
beaten Navy. They squeaked by North Carolina (12-10) in Chapel Hill, N.C., 
before losing two straight to Air Force (35-7) and Pittsburgh (31-14). The only 
other win was also on the road against Boston College (27-24), a game that 
appeared to turn the season around. But four straight losses followed to James 
Madison (24-20), Notre Dame (41-0), Syracuse (38-17) and Delaware (10-9), when 
kicker Frank Schenk missed a 28-yard field goal with time running out. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-8 record is a far cry from where Uzelac said he would be at the end of 
his third year when he took the Navy job in January 1987, replacing Gary 
Tranquill, who was 3-8 in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt strongly the very worst we should have been this year was 5-6," he 
said. "I thought we would win 7 or 8 at the best, depending on how lucky we 
were. But we also had some unanswered questions about our team." 
</P>
<P>
Uzelac, who came to Navy in 1987 after spending four years as an assistant 
under Bo Schembechler at Michigan, said he has not felt any pressure from 
alumni or administration at any time this season. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has said anything about that," Uzelac said. "The pressure I've felt has 
been self-inflicted by me." 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether there is any concern about the coaching situation, Jack 
Lengyel, Navy's athletic director, replied, "We are very confident in our 
coaching situation, and our main concern now is beating Army." 
</P>
<P>
Uzelac said some changes will have to be made, and he hopes to address those 
problems as soon as the season is completed.

RAMONA TIED, 28-28, ON RALLY BY GLENDORA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendora came back from a 28-7 deficit to tie Ramona, 28-28, in the Southern 
Section Division IV title game Saturday night at Citrus College. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora opened the scoring a 46-yard pass play from J.J. O'Laughlin to Bill 
Zernickow in the first quarter. But Ramona's Troy Thomas -- who had 171 yards 
rushing for the game -- countered with first-half touchdown runs of 62, two and 
nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona (9-3-1) increased its lead to 28-7 on Marc Johnson's 51-yard run in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Glendora came back to tie the score on a 14-yard touchdown run by 
Zernickow, O'Laughlin's 19-yard scoring pass to Phil McGee and a one-yard run 
by O'Laughlin with 7:51 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
O'Laughlin completed 10 of 22 passes for 200 yards for Glendora (13-1).

SANTA BARBARA, MUIR CO-CHAMPS AFTER 7-7 TIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Without the luxury of an overtime in the Southern Section Division II finals, 
Santa Barbara and Muir had to settle for a 7-7 tie before an overflow crowd of 
10,000 Saturday night at the La Playa Stadium in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
What the teams lacked in scoring they made up for in turnovers. They combined 
for seven in the second half alone. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara had advanced to the finals by defeating Canyon Country Canyon, 
28-27, in a controversial overtime game last week, while Pasadena Muir defeated 
No. 1 seeded Thousand Oaks, 9-3, also in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara got off to a good start when wide receiver Simon Banks took the 
opening kickoff to his 40-yard line, one defender away from a touchdown, but 
came up empty-handed when kicker George Rios missed a field goal attempt from 
the 31-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons' second possession was much more rewarding as they opened the scoring 
late in the first quarter on a fourth-and-two play. Poncho Renteria capped the 
five-play, 50-yard drive with a 26-yard pass to Banks. 
</P>
<P>
Muir struck back on a 79-yard punt return by senior defensive back Stefan 
Crutchfield with 7:45 to go in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected a low-scoring game coming in," Santa Barbara Coach Manuel Garcia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half it was the Dons' turn to deal with a lack of offense as they 
failed to capitalize on several opportunities. Fortunately for the Dons, the 
Mustangs couldn't capitalize either. 
</P>
<P>
Muir's second possession of the third quarter ended when Banks picked off a 
Renteria pass on his own 45. On their next possession, the Mustangs drove to 
the the Dons' 25 before Don defensive back Robby Blakeney recovered running 
back Sam Williford's fumble. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons' defense saved the game again in the fourth quarter, when Bryan Stiles 
intercepted a pass in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Mustangs struck back immediately when defensive back Demitrius 
Martin picked off a Renteria pass, only the second interception Renteria had 
thrown this year. 
</P>
<P>
The turnovers continued two plays later when Santa Barbara nose guard George 
Amezcua hit Andre Devizen as he took a handoff from quarterback Sedric Thomas, 
forcing a fumble. Renteria then threw his second interception of the game and 
the third of the season, giving the Mustangs the ball back with 36 seconds to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas managed to move the Mustangs to the Dons' 20 with a 33-yard pass to 
Martin, but then he was intercepted by Don defensive back Greg Araujo. 
</P>
<P>
However, Santa Barbara was unable to get a final play off.

A LAST LOOK AT SOME GREAT MATCHES IN A MEMORABLE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As professional tennis gets ready to move into the last decade of the 20th 
Century, it is time to say goodby to 1989, a year noteworthy for victories by 
two 17-year-olds in Paris and a West German named Boris. 
</P>
<P>
The most memorable matches of the year? Well, it's a crowded field, but here is 
a completely subjective list. In it, you will find outcomes that surprise, 
upset and shock, without which it wouldn't be much of a year. 
</P>
<P>
There are also turning points and ends, and that seems a fairly appropriate way 
to conclude a year, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
1. Michael Chang vs. Ivan Lendl 
</P>
<P>
June 5, fourth round, French Open 
</P>
<P>
Playing the fifth set with leg cramps so painful he had to stand during 
changeovers, Chang, 17, shocked the No. 1 player in the world and won the 
4-hour 36-minute match, 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3. Bud Collins of the Boston 
Globe and NBC-TV called it "the most colossal upset in the history of tennis." 
Said Lendl, when asked if he would have won if Chang hadn't had cramps: "That 
we will never know." 
</P>
<P>
2. Steffi Graf vs. Arantxa Sanchez 
</P>
<P>
June 10, final, French Open 
</P>
<P>
Nearly as stunning was the 7-6 (8-6), 3-6, 7-5 victory of the previously 
unheralded 17-year-old Sanchez over the seemingly invincible Graf. After match 
point, Sanchez tumbled onto the red clay of Roland Garros and when she got up, 
she said: "I have beaten the No. 1 player in the world." Graf, who served for 
the match at 5-3 in the third set and did not win a single point, found a plus 
in the defeat: "No more questions about the Grand Slam, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
3. Boris Becker vs. Ivan Lendl 
</P>
<P>
July 8, semifinal, Wimbledon 
</P>
<P>
A 76-minute rain delay gave Becker time to regroup from a one-set deficit in 
the fourth set when he was down two service breaks. Lendl led, 3-0, when the 
rains came, and he appeared well on his way to reaching the final of the 
tournament he craves more than any other. "I knew I was going to be out of 
these championships in about 15 minutes," Becker said. Instead, Lendl was out, 
hollow-eyed and winless for a 10th time. Reporters surrounded Lendl. How do you 
get over something like this? "Time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
4. Boris Becker vs. Andre Agassi 
</P>
<P>
July 21-22, Davis Cup, Munich 
</P>
<P>
Even by tension-wracked Davis Cup standards, this one was special, a 6-7 (7-4), 
6-7 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4), 6-3, 6-4 come-from-behind victory for Becker. The match 
was halted after four sets because it was past midnight, and by Davis Cup 
rules, it could be postponed until the next day if both sides so desired. 
Becker finished it the next day and said, "It is so much more than a Davis Cup 
semifinal for people in this country." Agassi leaped the net to congratulate 
Becker: "When you pour your heart and guts into (a match) you just feel such 
great emotion." 
</P>
<P>
5. Michael Chang vs. Stefan Edberg 
</P>
<P>
June 11, final, French Open 
</P>
<P>
Chang won, 6-1, 3-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, to become the first American male to win 
the French Open since Tony Trabert in 1955. He also became the youngest man 
ever to win a Grand Slam event. Said Chang: "It's hard to really think about 
it. It just doesn't click in my head. It's definitely an achievement that will 
be with me the rest of my life." Edberg said that Chang should have been 
worried. "But he's young and probably doesn't think too much." 
</P>
<P>
6. Chris Evert vs. Zina Garrison 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 5, quarterfinal, U.S. Open 
</P>
<P>
It was the end of an era in women's tennis. Buoyed by a flashy victory over 
15-year-old Monica Seles in the previous round, Evert had high hopes. But her 
match with Garrison became her 113th and final one at her 19th and final U.S. 
Open. Garrison won, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2, and said she felt like a villain because 
Evert had announced that she was playing in her last major tournament. Said Ted 
Tinling, historian of women's tennis for more than 60 years: "Now, the sun has 
truly set." 
</P>
<P>
7. Thomas Muster vs. Yannick Noah 
</P>
<P>
March 31, semifinal, 
</P>
<P>
International Players Championship 
</P>
<P>
On the verge of a big breakthrough after forcing Lendl to go a tough four sets 
in an Australian Open semifinal, Muster made a furious comeback to defeat Noah, 
5-7, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2, and earn the right to play Lendl in the final. It was 
a grand victory for the Austrian Muster, who got a massage and drank a beer 
with coach Ronnie Lietgeb. Then Muster went out for a sandwich but was involved 
in a freakish autombile accident when a driver, apparently drunk, rammed 
Muster's parked car and pushed it back into his knee. Muster suffered torn 
ligaments in his left knee. "It was a great moment for us," Lietgeb said. 
"Unfortunately, it was a very short celebration." 
</P>
<P>
8. Mats Wilander vs. Ramesh Krishnan 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 19, 2nd round, Australian Open 
</P>
<P>
This match marked the beginning of the end for Wilander, who came to Melbourne 
as the Australian Open's defending champion, as well as the No. 1-ranked player 
in the world. But after Wilander lost to Krishnan, 6-3, 6-7, 7-6, he saw Lendl 
replace him as No. 1. Wilander's explanation: "I just played terrible." He 
wouldn't play much better the rest of 1989 and closed out his most 
disappointing year at No. 12. But this match against Krishnan signaled the 
beginning of the slide. 
</P>
<P>
9. John McEnroe vs. Darren Cahill 
</P>
<P>
June 27, 1st round, Wimbledon 
</P>
<P>
On a gray, windy Tuesday on the finely manicured green lawn of Centre Court, 
John McEnroe had to struggle in the first match he played. McEnroe dropped the 
first two sets before his array of precision volleys put away the upstart 
Australian, 4-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 8-6. Afterward, McEnroe said: "I know I can win 
this tournament. I've done it before and I hope I can do it again." Not this 
year, he wouldn't. McEnroe lost to Edberg in the semifinals, 7-5, 7-6 (7-2), 
7-6 (7-5). "I did the best I could; it just wasn't good enough," McEnroe said 
of the match against Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
10. Aaron Krickstein vs. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Gilbert, Michael Chang 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 23-24, semifinal, final, 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Open 
</P>
<P>
Krickstein entered this tournament ranked No. 16 and finished the year No. 8, 
due in part to his victory at UCLA, where he became a champion of adversity. 
First, Krickstein faced seven match points and saved them all. He trailed 
Gilbert, 1-6, 2-5, and still won. Then Krickstein played hometown favorite 
Chang in the final, fell behind again, 2-6, 1-4, and again came back to win, 
2-6, 6-4, 6-2. Just after he put away a volley on match point, Krickstein 
yelled: "I did it." He surely did. 
</P>
<P>
Shot of the Year 
</P>
<P>
That would be the luckiest shot of the year, too, the one Becker hit against 
Derrick Rostagno in the second round of the U.S. Open. In the fourth set, 
Rostagno had match point against Becker and was already in position to win the 
match on an easy volley, but Becker's shot clipped the top of the net, and 
Rostagno could only swing wildly at it and miss. Becker eventually won in a 
fifth set and went on to take his first Grand Slam title other than Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Quote of the Year 
</P>
<P>
From the quirky mind of the slow-talking, slow-walking, bearded Czechoslovak, 
Miloslav Mecir, who was asked at the Australian Open to expand about his 
feelings of urban areas, such as Melbourne, and nature: 
</P>
<P>
"I like nature more. I think each country has different nature. And the 
buildings, sometimes they're made of different architecture. But nature is 
something different. You cannot change it just like that. It has to be there 
for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Oh.

Jorge Paez, angered by a sixth-round point deduction for holding, unleashed a 
flurry of unanswered punches to stop challenger Lupe Gutierrez and retain his 
International Boxing Federation featherweight title Saturday at Reno. 
</P>
<P>
The two boxers were nearly even on all three judges' scorecards going into the 
sixth round, but referee Mills Lane took away a point after Paez, 24, held 
Gutierrez's head during an exchange of blows. 
</P>
<P>
Paez, 33-2 with 25 knockouts, responded by battering Gutierrez until Lane 
stopped the fight with 2:01 gone in the round.

<P>
SAROS BRIG A WIRE-TO-WIRE WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saros Brig has been kind to Dominick Manzi. 
</P>
<P>
She provided the trainer with his first win on his own last May 12, two weeks 
after a heart attack claimed his father, Joe Manzi. There was an emotional 
scene in the winner's circle after the 5-year-old mare held off favored 
Rosadora. 
</P>
<P>
Almost seven months later, Saros Brig gave Manzi, 31, his initial stakes 
victory in the second division of the $83,350 Dahlia Handicap Saturday at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Now four for five on the Hollypark turf, she used the same tactics she had in 
two of her other wins. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, she led every step of the way, eventually defeating 7-10 favorite 
Nikishka by a length and a half in 1:40 2/5 for 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the California-bred daughter of Saros, winners have been hard to 
come by for Manzi, who currently has 10 horses under his care. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a little tough at the start," he said, "but things are starting to pick 
up now. 
</P>
<P>
"Saros Brig had good speed away from there and she likes this grass course. 
Basically, that's the way she likes to run here. Gary (Stevens) rode a perfect 
race. We'll take a look at the Matriarch (Dec. 24) and see how it comes up." 
</P>
<P>
Beneficiary of a trip similar to the one she got while easily winning the Las 
Palmas Handicap at Oak Tree, Nikishka made no impression on Saros Brig in the 
stretch, prompting Eddie Delahoussaye to suggest perhaps all wasn't right with 
the 4-year-old Nijinsky filly. 
</P>
<P>
"She wasn't 100%," he said. "She's a better filly than she showed here. She 
never switched leads. She ran the last three-eighths of a mile on her left 
lead." 
</P>
<P>
Well-placed by Chris McCarron throughout, Stylish Star drew off in the first 
division, beating 61-1 shot Ariosa by nearly two lengths in 1:40 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
Much-troubled when third in the Louis R. Rowan Handicap last month, the 
3-year-old daughter of Our Native made a 2-1 payoff look like a gift. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have won two in a row with her," trainer Dan Hendricks said. "In her 
last race, she went in the air at the start, then was six or seven wide on the 
turn. It blew all our chance and still she was only beaten by a neck. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a good filly. She runs from behind, she runs on the pace and today she 
ran in the middle. She's run well every time for us. We've got to sit down and 
talk over what we're going to do next. We might bring her back in the 
Matriarch." 
</P>
<P>
Baba Cool, the 7-2 second choice and winner of the Rowan, was sixth. She had 
some traffic trouble, but did nothing once she got clear. 
</P>
<P>
Although a final decision won't be made until Thursday, it appears that 
Individualist I will be supplemented for $50,000 to the $1-million Hollywood 
Futurity a week from today. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer David Hofmans said the 2-year-old son of Bel Bolide, who is owned by 
John Mabee's Golden Eagle Farm, came out of his Hollywood Prevue win Wednesday 
in fine shape. "He's feeling good," Hofmans said. "We'll wait until Thursday to 
decide, but right now, it looks real good." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Grand Canyon, the Breeders' Cup Juvenile runner-up and probable 
favorite, some of the others being considered for the Grade I mile event are 
Hoist The Flag winner Single Dawn; Talented Pirate, who worked seven furlongs 
in 1:24 2/5 about 50 minutes before first post Saturday; Phantom X., who broke 
his maiden in his second start for Jack Van Berg; and Farma Way, who shocked 
nonwinners in his first local appearance for Neil Boyce after finishing far 
back in his August debut at Arlington Park. 
</P>
<P>
Farma Way, a son of Marfa, worked five furlongs in :58 2/5 eight days ago, then 
came back with a 1:11 2/5 drill for six furlongs Friday. "He works leisurely 
and goes about things like an old pro," Boyce said. "I would prefer to have 
another race under him before going a mile, but I entered him in a race that 
didn't fill (the minimum number of horses to make a race were not entered). 
</P>
<P>
"He needs more seasoning, but if the owner (Quarter B Farm) wants to supplement 
him, we'll go in the Futurity." 
</P>
<P>
One youngster who won't be a starter next Sunday is Stylish King. X-rays taken 
Friday after his fourth-place finish at 4-5 in the Prevue were negative, but 
his shins will be fired Monday, trainer Jay Robbins said, and he will be 
sidelined for at least a month. The promising son of Roberto came out of the 
Prevue with some soreness in his left shin. 
</P>
<P>
After winning six times at Laurel Saturday to up his record total to 564 
victories in 1989, Kent Desormeaux doesn't figure to advance toward his target 
of 600 today at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Desormeaux, 19, who eclipsed Chris McCarron's record of 546 wins Nov. 30, is 
named on four horses in his first California appearance and each will be a 
longshot. 
</P>
<P>
He begins his day in the first race with Clapper, who returns for $10,000 after 
being idle since October, 1987, then comes back with Havanaffair, who's been 
away since finishing last in the Malibu Stakes last Dec. 26, in the fifth. 
Desormeaux finishes up with Silent 'N Nasty, who steps up a notch after being 
claimed for $40,000 early last month, in the sixth and Baffo, who will make his 
grass debut in the ninth after beating only one horse in his initial race 
against winners. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gary Boulanger will miss the rest of the meeting due to a back problem. The 
rider, who had struggled locally in recent weeks after arriving from Bay 
Meadows, is scheduled to visit Dr. Robert Kerlan Tuesday. Boulanger hasn't 
ridden since finishing second aboard Pretender's Gold in the second race 
Thursday. . . . Rich Silverstein is the new agent for Rafael Meza, replacing 
Pat McDowell. . . . Tsu's Dawning, a 2-year-old son of Tsunami Slew who 
dominated maidens a week ago today, will skip the Futurity, according to 
trainer Ed Gregson. 
</P>
<P>
Laffit Pincay, who has ridden both Sam Who and Olympic Prospect, will be on the 
former in the National Sprint Championship next Saturday. Alex Solis, who rode 
Olympic Prospect in the Breeders' Cup, will handle John Sadler's gelding. . . . 
There was only one perfect ticket in the Pick Six and it was worth $88,706.80. 
. . . Gary Stevens and Eddie Delahoussaye each had two wins Saturday and the 
latter holds a 25-23 lead in the jockey standings after 19 days.

RISE IN EXISTING-HOME VALUES IS SLOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In another sign that the Southland's once-sizzling housing market is cooling, a 
survey conducted by a real estate research group says appraised values of 
sample existing homes are rising at their slowest rate in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest slowdowns were recorded in Orange and Ventura counties, according 
to the semiannual survey conducted by the Real Estate Research Council of 
Southern California. The council is a nonprofit organization headquartered at 
Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Estimated values in Orange County rose an average 18% from October, 1988 to 
October, 1989, down from the 27% annual appreciation rate logged from April, 
1988 to April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Values in Ventura County rose at a 14% annual clip in the October-to-October 
period, less than half the 29% yearly rate recorded six months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"The housing market is cooling, but it's still pretty strong," said Michael 
Carney, the economist and Cal Poly professor who conducted the survey. 
</P>
<P>
"Home prices are still rising. It's just that they're not rising as fast as 
they were before." 
</P>
<P>
Results of the survey are based on the appraised value of 214 existing homes 
scattered across seven Southern California counties. 
</P>
<P>
The same homes are appraised every six months, regardless of whether they are 
sold, in order to track general price movements. New homes are excluded from 
the survey. 
</P>
<P>
Estimated values in Los Angeles County were up 24% from the year-ago survey. 
Values in the East San Gabriel Valley-Pomona subregion were up 32%; in the San 
Fernando Valley, 27% and the North Central-Pasadena area, 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Values have risen an average 24% in the Westside-Santa Monica market and in 
Southeast Los Angeles over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Appraised values rose fastest in San Bernardino County, a huge area where 
values surged 29% from October, 1988 to October, 1989, the survey said. That 
was nearly three times the appreciation rate recorded a year earlier, according 
to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Values in Riverside County rose a healthy 23% over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
"Prices in San Bernardino and Riverside are catching up with the rest of 
Southern California," Carney said. "Demand there has been helped by all the 
people who want to buy a house, but can't afford a home in Los Angeles or 
Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
The survey found that values in San Diego County are up 24% from a year ago, 
while values in Santa Barbara County are up 18%. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, values in the seven-county area rose an average 8.1% over the past six 
months and are up 22.9% from a year ago, the report said.

RIGHT TREE CAN ENHANCE HOME

Trees can do a lot to enhance your home and property, but proper selection is 
important, says Phil Hahn, director of forestry research at Georgia-Pacific 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"Small- to medium-sized trees planted at the corners of a home can give the 
illusion of extending the width of a narrow house," Hahn says. "Japanese maples 
and gray birch are excellent choices because they won't outgrow a small or 
single-story home." 
</P>
<P>
Because of their full shapes, red maples, honey locusts and other shade trees 
are used to accent tall houses and provide contrast to square homes. Trees of 
various heights at maturity often are planted in rows to break the roof lines 
of long, low houses. 
</P>
<P>
Trees such as maple, birch, white spruce and yews provide soft accents at 
angular corners and have tame root systems, so they can be planted close to the 
foundation, Hahn says. 
</P>
<P>
To create a privacy screen between properties, plant low-branched trees such as 
beech and sweet gum because they have dense, heavy foliage. 
</P>
<P>
"These trees also are used to define property boundaries, compose backgrounds 
and block wind," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Tree barriers to block sound or unsightly views should have light-colored 
foliage and low branches to give a feeling of spaciousness. Cedar, Canadian 
hemlock, upright yews and other columnar trees often are used in hedgerows for 
natural screening or in areas with limited space. 
</P>
<P>
If poor drainage is a problem, silver maples, honey locusts, common hackberrys 
and willows can survive in wet, low-lying areas.

broke her foot several years ago, the energetic Los Angeles dance instructor 
could not have known it would be the first step in a career move that would 
take her from the pas de deux to the Danse Derriere. 
</P>
<P>
Chair Dancing, as Stolove, 31, has christened her rhythmic exercise program 
that is performed in a seated position, has been featured at recreational 
centers around Southern California. Kaiser Permanente's Panorama City medical 
center is offering classes through Stolove for patients suffering from 
arthritis, diabetes and other ailments that limit their freedom of movement, 
and the corporation is planning to pick up the program for distribution to its 
other centers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The man who produced Jane Fonda's Workout series thinks Stolove might have hit 
on something big for an aging population of Americans, who might like to take a 
seat after years of jogging and the injuries it can cause. "I could make Chair 
Dancing into the next popular and profitable exercise fad," Sidney Galanty 
wrote recently to Stolove. 
</P>
<P>
Chair Dancing consists of exercises and dancelike movements performed in a 
chair. Both the legs and arms are used in repetitive movements that simulate 
playing a trombone, swimming the crawl stroke, flapping the arms like a bird, 
and tapping the toes. Stolove says the regimen can boost an exerciser's heart 
rate to 140 beats per minute, which she explains is high enough to achieve 
aerobic benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it has been an absolute miracle. I had become extremely sedentary," 
said Cara Mitchell, 59, of North Hollywood. A hundred pounds overweight and 
suffering from arthritis, Mitchell once needed 20 minutes to climb stairs. Now, 
although she must still pause on each step, the trip takes only five minutes 
and she has lost 40 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Stolove says her techniques are used "in both hospital and out-patient 
programs" but are not designed solely for the infirm. Executives at Kaiser take 
breaks from high-level meetings by flailing their arms around, according to her 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Raised in Hollywood, Fla., the outgoing Stolove took dance lessons as a child. 
Though she is 5-foot-7, and weighs 122 pounds, when she was young she was 
ridiculed for being overweight. But she kept dancing, especially tap and 
ballet, and eventually shed the pounds. After graduating from high school, she 
enrolled in the dance program at the University of Michigan, where a fellow 
ballet student was Madonna, whom Stolove recalls as "kind of a wild character." 
</P>
<P>
Stolove stayed long enough to obtain degrees in psychology and dance, then 
headed west to California, where she began teaching ballroom dancing at the 
University of Judaism in Los Angeles. Then, in 1983, she broke her foot. 
</P>
<P>
"What does a dance teacher do with a broken foot?" she asked in an interview in 
a San Fernando Valley restaurant, where she demonstrated her techniques to the 
interested amusement of other diners. "I began out of necessity teaching my 
class sitting down." 
</P>
<P>
But she did not turn her serendipitous discovery of dance by the seats of the 
pants into a vocation until after she was hired by a cruise liner to lead an 
exercise class during a monthlong ocean voyage to Australia. Because it was 
difficult to stand and exercise on a rocking boat, she sat down once more. 
"Each day the class got bigger," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
When she returned to the United States she commissioned a friend to write 
original Chair Dancing music and recorded an audiotape that she still sells. 
From its beginnings two years ago, the program has grown to the point where 
there are now a dozen classes each week taught by 10 teachers at synagogues, at 
homes for the elderly, and at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
She has even led some of Kaiser's top executives, including the heads of 
medical departments. "I always ask people to play," she said. "I thought they 
would stare at me like I was from another planet." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the executives in three-piece suits broke up in laughter and joined 
right in. 
</P>
<P>
The contract with Kaiser could be a big break for her growing business, she 
said. The medical corporation has even allocated $40,000 to shoot a videotape 
of the 45-minute exercise program. If Galanty is right, she could even become 
the Jane Fonda of the sofa set. 
</P>
<P>
Mei-Ling Scwartz, the administrator of the Health Education department at 
Kaiser's Panorama City facility, extols the program for its simplicity and its 
application for people with all sorts of medical problems. "You can get aerobic 
activities without going to a gym," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"All you need is your body and your chair." 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser offers a six-week series of classes at its Freedom From Fat center. 
Among the most impressed by the results is Mitchell, the woman with arthritis, 
high blood pressure and a weight problem. 
</P>
<P>
She wanted to exercise but could not leap around in a shiny leotard. Despite 
her weight, she had always looked younger than her years, but felt "like a 
woman of 80." Since exercising every night, her tendinitis has eased and her 
joints have loosened. "Now my insides are beginning to feel like my outside," 
she said.

CITIZENS PATROL PROVIDES HELPING HANDS

<TEXT>
<P>
It's Sunday morning at Stony Point in Chatsworth, and a man is stuck in a 
crevice of a huge rock formation, just inches from the edge of a 30-foot drop. 
Half a dozen rescue workers, equipped with ropes and a stretcher, are trying to 
bring him to safety. 
</P>
<P>
"Pull on that line!" one rescue worker yells, while another straps the man onto 
the stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
"Get him away from that rock!" screams a third, as the stretcher brushes 
against a ledge on its way down. 
</P>
<P>
When the stretcher reaches the ground, Antonio Arizo, the man strapped aboard, 
smiles. "It was just like an E-ticket ride at Disneyland," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Arizo could joke because he wasn't really injured. Everyone at the site was 
practicing rescue techniques, part of their training for the Citizens Emergency 
Mobile Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
CEMP is an all-volunteer, nonprofit organization that helps the Los Angeles 
Police Department at fires, floods, earthquakes and other disasters that 
require evacuations and crowd control. The group, financed solely by donations, 
also helps search for missing people and provides first aid and other services 
to community organizations and private agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The group's mobile command post, a blue van equipped with several radios and a 
cellular phone, is parked at the Police Department's Devonshire Division. 
Members are alerted by beepers and can get to most San Fernando Valley 
locations within half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"They are really invaluable to us," said Sgt. David Johnson of the Devonshire 
Division. "The citizens of L.A. are really getting a bargain from these 
people." 
</P>
<P>
During the holidays, Johnson said, CEMP helps police monitor shopping center 
parking lots, where many crimes occur. 'They're our eyes and ears," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said CEMP was especially helpful during the Granada Hills brush fire of 
December, 1988, evacuating residents and assessing damage. CEMP members also 
provide first aid at 10-kilometer races and help organize the Chatsworth and 
Granada Hills Christmas parades, freeing police officers for other duties. 
</P>
<P>
Members must be 18 or over and trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 
first aid. They meet at least once a month to practice search-and-rescue 
techniques. Sometimes they will send members out into wilderness areas and then 
try to locate them. "We tell someone to go get lost, and they do," said member 
Mike St. Amand. 
</P>
<P>
The group has about 30 members, all from the San Fernando and Antelope valleys. 
Five are women. 
</P>
<P>
Member Richard White of Northridge said most people don't realize the CEMP 
members are not police officers. "Usually we're 'Officer' to the public," said 
White, 29, an environmental consultant. "We don't get a whole lot of thanks for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
But, members said, they do get a lot of rewards. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, for instance, White and member Jeff Keitz were providing 
first aid services for a jeep race in Palmdale when one jeep broke an axle and 
got wedged between boulders. In the back seat of the jeep sat a pair of 
frightened 3-year-old twin boys. White and Keitz each rescued a baby. 
</P>
<P>
"They just hung on to us," said Keitz, 20, a Pierce College student. "When they 
grabbed us, it was such a good feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Keitz said he joined CEMP because he wanted to make a difference in the 
community. "It seemed like an organization that really does something," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Keitz said he has learned a lot about safety in the eight months he has been a 
member and has gained a lot of confidence. "If I see someone fall or a car on 
fire," he said, "I know there's something I can do besides sit there and 
panic."

TRYING TO MAKE LIFE LIVABLE IN URBAN SUBURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON, Whiteson is a Los Angeles architecture critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"City making now is different from that of previous times. Modern 
transportation methods make it possible to weave (a city) into a harmonious 
unit ... to retain the flowers and orchards and lawns, the invigorating free 
air from the ocean, the bright sunshine and the elbow room which have marked it 
in the past. The transportation lines ... have made it possible to get far out 
in the midst of the orchards and fields for home making." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1905 the San Fernando Valley inspired the Los Angeles Express to extol its 
virtues as a suburban paradise. But 84 years later, many of the Valley's 
1.2-million inhabitants believe that vision is rapidly vanishing in the smog. 
</P>
<P>
The bright sunshine has faded, the elbow room has shrunk, the fields have been 
overrun with housing subdivisions and office complexes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disaster," declared Gerald A. Silver, president of the Homeowners of 
Encino. "The Valley I moved to 35 years ago has been ruined. It's fast becoming 
a mini-Manhattan, totally unfit for family life. Urbanization has run amok." 
</P>
<P>
Irate homeowners, frustrated developers, puzzled planners, troubled 
transportation experts, nervous politicians and agitated commuters fret about 
the Valley's urbanization. But they lack a shared vision for the Valley's 
future as a city -- or collection of cities. Everyone agrees something must be 
done, but nobody seems to know quite what that something should be. 
</P>
<P>
Deuk Perrin, the Los Angeles city planning official who supervises the south 
Valley, admits that planners are in a "reactive posture. We're simply 
struggling to solve overwhelming problems. We have no way of developing a 
coherent vision for the Valley's future urban shape." 
</P>
<P>
"As a planner I have to be optimistic," said Perrin, who grew up in the Valley, 
lives in Reseda and works in the Van Nuys Municipal Building. But, "as a 
homeowner, I'm pessimistic about the area's future as a pleasant place to live 
and raise kids. Like any homeowner, I worry about the intrusion of development 
into the quiet residential neighborhoods that attracted so many people to come 
and settle here." 
</P>
<P>
Preserving the integrity and amenity of single-family residential neighborhoods 
is a prime objective of Valley planners. The problem is how to achieve this 
while allowing the Valley to develop and cope with the extra traffic 
development brings. 
</P>
<P>
Most planners and urban design experts envision this as the best possible 
scenario for controlled urbanization in the Valley: 
</P>
<P>
* Construction of a comprehensive, attractive and efficient rapid transit 
system as part of a rational regional system. 
</P>
<P>
* Introduction of projects that combine residential and commercial development 
concentrated in several centers. 
</P>
<P>
* Construction of apartments (planners call them "multiple dwelling units") 
mainly along major arterial roadways as buffers between commercial strips and 
the single-family neighborhoods that lie alongside. 
</P>
<P>
The urbanization of suburban regions such as the Valley is a national 
phenomenon. As the old city downtowns become expensive and congested, 
commercial development has moved to the suburbs in search of cheaper space and 
proximity to where many office workers live. 
</P>
<P>
The result is the creation of what some experts call "suburban downtowns" or 
"urban villages." Warner Center is a prime example, as is the proposed 
$2-billion development planned for the transformation of Universal City into a 
huge commercial, entertainment and residential complex. 
</P>
<P>
The shift of office space from traditional downtowns to the suburbs is 
reflected in the figures for commercial construction. "Since 1960, downtown Los 
Angeles' share of the metropolitan office market has declined from 60% to 34%," 
Christopher Leinberger and Charles Lockwood said in an Atlantic Monthly article 
titled "How Business Is Reshaping America." 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is perhaps the most evolved example of the urban village 
phenomenon," Leinberger and Lockwood suggest. "The metropolitan area has given 
rise to 16 smaller urban village cores, among them Century City, Costa 
Mesa/Irvine/Newport Beach, Encino, Glendale, the airport, Warner Center, 
Ontario, Pasadena, Universal City/Burbank and Westwood." 
</P>
<P>
But the urban village pattern -- or Centers Concept, which has been the city of 
Los Angeles' basic plan for 20 years -- has often created more problems here 
than it has solved. 
</P>
<P>
The concentration of commercial activity has generated tremendous volumes of 
traffic that spill over into residential neighborhoods. Several of the major 
intersections around Warner Center, for example, already have reached a point 
where drivers must wait for three or more traffic light changes before they can 
cross. And Warner Center is still several million square feet short of its 
total allowable amount of commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the concentration of development in centers runs counter to the 
long-established L.A. pattern of strip development or "linear downtowns," such 
as Ventura Boulevard, the Valley's "Main Street." The stretched-out commercial 
strip, which serves to catch the eye of passing motorists, is an urban pattern 
developed in response to the private car. 
</P>
<P>
"I still support the Centers Concept," said Ted Stein, an Encino resident who 
is a member of the Los Angeles City Planning Commission. "It's the only way to 
prevent the overwhelming of the Valley's residential neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
Stein, like many policy-makers, believes the key to making the concept work is 
to allow a mixture of multiple housing and commercial development in the same 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"Mixed use is the wave of the future," he said. "It is the only way to allow 
the Valley to grow without ruining its character. 
</P>
<P>
"It's also a way to create affordable housing for the low-income families who 
service the Valley. If blue-collar workers have to locate beyond the Valley's 
boundaries, in Palmdale or Lancaster, that will only exacerbate the rush-hour 
commuter traffic problem." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Mayor Tom Bradley convened a high-powered group of 
homeowners, developers, architects and planning officials with a mandate to 
study the introduction of zoning ordinances that would allow mixed-use 
development. A specific designation for mixed-use zoning does not exist at 
present in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Allowing mixed use is a vital step in the planned urbanization of the city," 
said USC Architecture Dean Robert Harris, a member of the mayor's study group. 
"Through careful design we can have increased density and increased amenities. 
We can have our cake and eat it too." 
</P>
<P>
Harris said he viewed the Valley as a perfect laboratory for trying mixed-use 
developments that could upgrade the architectural and human quality of many of 
its commercial strips. 
</P>
<P>
"Growth without vision is a monster," Harris said. "If growth occurs without a 
change in the character of the city it becomes a kind of elephantiasis. But the 
form this development must take is different from the all-too-common trashy 
design of the past that has degraded districts like Van Nuys," he said. "It 
must be inventive and diverse. It must be urban." 
</P>
<P>
Vision Van Nuys, an intensive workshop held last fall by the City Planning 
Department and the Urban Design Advisory Coalition, suggested in its report 
that, while existing areas of single-family, low-density housing should be 
protected, new mixed residential and commercial developments should be 
encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
Offering developers the carrot of a bonus for building affordable housing 
should be combined, some planners suggest, with the stick of "linkage" fees 
levied on commercial developments to finance such much-needed amenities as 
traffic- flow improvements and day care. 
</P>
<P>
"Developers must provide funds to mitigate the traffic consequences of their 
projects," said Studio City citizen activist Dan Shapiro. "Such measures might 
include a subsidy for local transportation projects such as minibuses, van 
pools, street widening, traffic lights and so on. This levy on developers is no 
different in principle than requiring industrial polluters to solve the 
problems they create." 
</P>
<P>
Developers agree in principle with the concept of linkage fees, but they demand 
a trade-off in an elimination of the delays their projects now often face from 
militant homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
"Developers desire certainty," said Bob Selleck, developer with his brother, 
actor Tom Selleck, of The Village shopping center in Reseda. "We need to know 
up front exactly what the rules of the game are, and how we can speed up the 
approvals process." 
</P>
<P>
Selleck said it has taken almost six years to negotiate with the community to 
get approval of his medium-size commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
Selleck insisted that the only fair exchange for such levies is a guarantee of 
certainty in the process -- "the certainty that you can develop your own 
property according to a fixed set of rules that don't get changed on you all 
the time as one protester after another springs up out of the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to create such certainty and formalize community input into the 
planning process, the L.A. City Council last year instituted a program of 
Community Plan Advisory Committees (C-PACs) in each of the 35 community plan 
areas into which the city is divided (14 community plans areas are in the 
Valley). 
</P>
<P>
The 15-member C-PACs will have the responsibility of advising city planners on 
the character of the community plans, which are being revised citywide to bring 
them up to date while complying with the court-mandated down-zoning required 
under Assembly Bill 283. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to formalize the community's involvement in planning, to give it an 
official and steady voice," said Jerome Daniels, chairman emeritus of the 
Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assns. "The present ad-hoc situation, where 
homeowners have no recourse but to organize in spontaneous protest groups, 
encourages conflict more than rational negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
The Valley cannot grow without change, Daniels believes. And one of the changes 
he favors is a shift in emphasis from the private car to public rapid transit. 
</P>
<P>
"Cars are killing the Valley," he said. "We must get people out of their cars 
and into public transport. I know people resist the idea of a rail line running 
through their back yards, but it's an idea whose time has come. Without it we 
shall choke to death on our own gas fumes." 
</P>
<P>
Architect Rudolph De Chellis, president of the San Fernando Valley Chapter of 
the American Institute of Architects, said a coherent rapid transit system will 
have to be forced upon the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that people simply won't buy it, no matter how urgent the need," 
he said. "It will simply have to be rammed down the Valley's throat. But where 
is the leadership with the courage to take on public opinion on such an 
unpopular issue?" 
</P>
<P>
The lack of bold municipal leadership troubles many people concerned about the 
Valley's growth. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a widespread feeling that Los Angeles is out of control, that nobody's 
at the wheel as we head for the shoals," Silver said. "The Valley is an Exxon 
Valdez disaster waiting to happen." 
</P>
<P>
A major problem, many observers say, is that solutions to the Valley's dilemmas 
depend upon regional forces that are not under the control of the city or any 
coherent political body. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's much-publicized LA 2000 report recommended the creation of a 
regional Growth Management Agency to coordinate planning in the entire Southern 
California area from Ventura County to the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
"Chaos is ensured when so many small political jurisdictions work in isolation 
from one another," said UCLA architecture dean Richard Weinstein, a member of 
the LA 2000 Committee. "This old, porous political quilt, which allowed the 
energy of developers and entrepreneurs to push through the gaps in the fabric 
of control and create the vigorous and varied economy we all enjoy, will not 
serve us well in the future. Major problems like transportation, air quality, 
waste disposal and sewage require regional planning coordination." 
</P>
<P>
The LA 2000 report declared that "current regional planning efforts have not 
been implemented because existing organizations lack authority to move ahead 
with them." A coherent plan should relate regional transportation strategies to 
growth management planning, the report suggested. It should define standards 
for the use of space and specify the desired concentration of residents in 
relation to economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
Population changes over the region also challenge planners. The proportion of 
residents over 65 is rising fast. At the same time, the scarcity of affordable 
housing in areas such as the Valley forces less affluent families to live on 
the edges of the metropolitan region in new developments in Palmdale and 
Lancaster, a long way from the main centers of work in the Valley and the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
Put simply, as the population gets denser and the economy grows richer, the 
houses and apartments get scarcer and the commutes get longer. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of new form can the Valley's urbanization take to resolve these 
tensions and cope with the Valley's future? 
</P>
<P>
Most parties agree that the basic single-family home character of the Valley 
must be preserved. At the same time, housing must be provided for lower-income 
families close to the blue-collar jobs that must be created to eliminate the 
long commutes that make up so much of the area's traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
"The Valley needs a greater density of housing if it is to continue to 
prosper," said Norman Emerson, a public policy consultant. "Along with the 
housing, the Valley needs commercial development to create jobs close to where 
people live. A rational jobs-housing balance is the only way to reduce the 
intensity of cross-Valley commuting that now comprises around half the volume 
of rush-hour traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Build more apartments, some experts urge. Multifamily units, which already 
comprise about 44% of the Valley's housing stock, are projected to increase to 
half the housing over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Such strategies will transform the urban shape of the Valley without 
destroying its original character," said USC's Harris. "The new Valley will, I 
believe, still be tranquil, but it will also be more a varied and interesting 
place to inhabit. It will, in a word, become urbane."

SEARCHING FOR MORAL HEROES IN HOLOCAUST;

<P>
VALUES: RABBI UNLOCKS A FORGOTTEN FOOTNOTE IN HOLOCAUST HISTORY -- GOODNESS. HE 
LEARNS THOUSANDS RISKED THEIR LIVES TO SAVE JEWS.

<TEXT>
<P>
Rabbi Harold Schulweis began his search for moral heroes when his children sat 
down to watch a television special on the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
"I had this strange feeling of wanting them to see it," he recalled in a 
telephone interview, but "hoping that they would not leave totally despaired 
and paranoiac." 
</P>
<P>
For Schulweis, who lives in Oakland, the dilemma was doubly sharp. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I am, preaching from a Judaic point of view that the human being is 
created in the image of God and emphasizing the reality of goodness," he 
recalled thinking, "and I don't seem to have any empirical evidence of that, 
especially when the Holocaust is mentioned." 
</P>
<P>
So Schulweis began in the early 1960s to look for the other side of the 
Holocaust -- the unsung moral heroes of that dark period. And, happily, he 
found them. Thousands of ordinary people risked their positions and often their 
lives to save Jews during World War II. They are people such as: 
</P>
<P>
* Hermann Graebe, a German civilian contractor working with the German forces 
in the Soviet Union, who witnessed firsthand the massacre of Jews. He was so 
horrified that he requisitioned hundreds of Jews for work details, then got 
them to safety by reassigning them to a fictional branch office in the Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
* Aristedes de Sousa Mendes, a Portuguese consul who falsified hundreds of 
passports to get Jews into Portugal and then was stripped of his position and 
ridiculed for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
* Alexander and Mila Roslan, a Polish Christian couple, who harbored a Jewish 
child for three years. The Roslans sold their house and moved frequently to 
avoid detection by the Nazis. At one point, they used a sofa to smuggle the boy 
into a hospital for surgery and bribed the surgeon to keep it secret. 
</P>
<P>
* John Henry Weidner, a Seventh-day Adventist of Dutch descent who developed an 
escape line to the free countries of Switzerland and Spain during World War II. 
More than 1,100 people, many of them Jews, passed through this route to safety. 
Weidner was honored by the Jewish Foundation for Christian Rescuers for his 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that we are dealing with a considerable number -- not as large as 
the apathetic, and it's not as large as the persecutors -- but we are now 
beginning to speak in terms of tens of thousands," Schulweis said. "And as one 
remarkable Dutch rescuer told me: 'You know, rabbi, you talk only about the 
conspiracy of evil. I have not heard you speak about the conspiracy of 
goodness. . . . Do you think it could be done without the cooperation of the 
Dutch policeman and the Dutch grocery and our neighbors?' " 
</P>
<P>
During the early years of his search, Schulweis got little support or help. 
Jews feared the effort to find heroes would turn into a whitewash of the 
Holocaust, he said. Even Christians did not want to respond. 
</P>
<P>
"Many Christians that I've tried to speak to have an understandably difficult 
time to absorb the Holocaust, because it's so filled with accusation and 
condemnation of the failures of priests and ministers. But once they . . . see 
these Christian heroic personalities, they are then able to recognize that 
there is no hero without a villain, and they are able to accept the darkness 
because there is a light at the end of the tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
Now the tide is turning: Jews are beginning to re-examine the Holocaust and 
support Schulweis' efforts. In 1987, his Jewish Foundation for Christian 
Rescuers became a project of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it signals a certain maturity," said Bob Goodkind, the foundation's 
chairman. "The process is really just beginning, but at the same time I think 
we are getting a very beautiful reaction." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation's board includes Christians as well as Jews and has already 
raised enough money to begin providing financial aid to more than 100 needy 
rescuers in Europe and the United States. Many rescuers are in need, Schulweis 
said, because they're shunned by their own people and have not had contact from 
the Jewish community. Rescuers in the U.S., for example, receive $200 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, the foundation aims to locate and publicize the stories of 
rescuers as examples of moral leadership, said David Szonyi, foundation 
director. Next spring, the foundation plans to host a conference on moral 
courage. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you need heroes precisely from the so-called 'enemy' camp," Schulweis 
said. "What has happened, regretfully -- for reasons which are, I think, 
fascinating -- is that goodness is buried into at best some footnotes but 
mostly forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the Encyclopedia Judaica dismisses the rescuers of Anne 
Frank and her family, saying only: "They were kept alive by friendly Gentiles." 
</P>
<P>
Why this reluctance to acknowledge good? "I have a suspicion that there's 
greater challenge and fear in confronting goodness than in confronting evil," 
Schulweis said. "Compared to Eichmann, I'm a great guy. But compared to Graebe 
. . . and all these other people, I have to ask myself the challenging 
question: Would I unlock my doors and hide a family? It's a very important 
lesson for the post-Holocaust world, which has become extremely cynical and 
very despairing." 
</P>
<P>
"You have to want to look for goodness," he added. "And if you don't want to, 
you won't see it. . . . You know, if you look for godliness or divinity, you 
have to know where to look. And to be able to find it in the midst of a hell, 
it rekindles one's faith in the possibilities of goodness." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, food got so scarce that Aart and Johtje Vos established a rule. No 
one -- neither themselves nor the people they hid from the Nazis -- could talk 
about food except for one hour each day. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they made a game of that special hour. "Who remembers what a banana 
is?" Johtje Vos recalled the children being asked. Only the older ones knew the 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
For 4 1/2 years during World War II, the Voses endured Nazi raids and risked 
their lives to hide Jews and others. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was common decency," said Johtje Vos in a phone interview. Like 
many rescuers, she refuses to call herself courageous. "You don't say, 'Let's 
go and rescue some Jews.' That's not how it happened. It came to you." First a 
little boy and, eventually, many others came. Over the course of the war, 36 
people stayed with the couple six months or longer -- some for the entire war. 
</P>
<P>
Why did they do it? Vos stressed the strict Christian upbringing that she and 
her husband received. Rescuers often had strong moral teaching from a 
particular parent, added Schulweis, who has met or read many rescuers. 
Typically, they had a history of nonconformity, a humanitarianism that 
transcended religious or ethnic identity and, usually, some association with 
Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, "it's just remarkable how different the motivations are," 
Schulweis said. "Some will say, 'I did it because Jesus was a Jew, and these 
are his people.' And some will say, 'I didn't do anything because, after all, I 
know that Crucifixion story.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Voses, now living in Woodstock, N.Y., did not tell their story for 20 
years. But they are talking now, every chance they get, in the hopes that they 
can influence their grandchildren's generation. 
</P>
<P>
"What we see in the schools, in the families, is that they don't get the values 
that we got," Vos said. "That's what we are fighting for. And that will be an 
antidote for what our children have learned up to now."

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: HATTIE THE LIFE OF HATTIE MCDANIEL BY CARLTON JACKSON

Best known as Scarlett O'Hara's mammy in "Gone With the Wind," Hattie McDaniel 
played in about 300 films. It was not until after she received the Academy 
Award -- the first black person ever to win the honor -- that she was 
automatically given screen credits, although she was at the time no newcomer to 
the screen; her previous appearances had included "The Blonde Venus" and "I'm 
No Angel." "Hattie" draws on the actress' personal papers to tell the story of 
her life and career. A detailed chapter on the filming of "Gone With the Wind" 
gives insight into her professional relationships with fellow cast members 
Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh and Butterfly McQueen. 
</P>
<P>
McDaniel's portrayal of stereotypical black roles earned her the criticism of 
Walter White, executive secretary of the NAACP. A performer from age 15, the 
first black woman to sing on radio and among the first to appear regularly on 
television, McDaniel was proud of the advances she had made in her career, and 
deeply resented White's accusations. A chapter detailing this feud -- "The 
Crusade Against 'Mammyism' " -- gives insight into the inner workings of 
Hollywood negotiations, and airs the contemporary arguments on the role of film 
in promoting or combatting racial stereotypes; it is interesting to see how 
little has changed.

NONFICTION IN BRIEF: A THIEF IN THE NIGHT THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF POPE JOHN 
PAUL I BY JOHN CORNWELL (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $19.95; 366 PP.)BY SONJA BOLLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On Aug. 28, 1978, the conclave of bishops convened to choose a new Pope, and in 
the shortest session of the century -- almost the shortest in history -- 
elected the relatively unknown Albino Luciani. Mystery surrounded the choice 
almost immediately: Why, with the new internationalism in church hierarchy, 
concerns in the Third World and sweeping changes of Vatican II, would there be 
so little discussion among the bishops? British Cardinal Basil Hume's 
declaration -- "We felt as if our hands were being guided as we wrote his name 
on the paper!" -- didn't satisfy everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"In his first press conference as John Paul I," writes John Cornwell, "Luciani 
enthralled the world with his simplicity and humor." He announced his desire to 
be known not as Pontiff, but as Pastor of the Church, and he was dubbed "the 
smiling Pope." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty three days later, at age 65, John Paul I was declared dead of a heart 
attack. But suspicious circumstances -- the Pope's excellent health reports, 
for example -- and conflicting statements from the Vatican immediately pointed 
to a cover-up, if not to foul play. Among the most sensational of the rumors 
were that a secret autopsy had been performed and that the morticians had been 
summoned before the official time given for the discovery of the body. 
</P>
<P>
Cornwell, a British journalist, was invited by the Vatican in 1987 to lay to 
rest the various conspiracy theories that had persistently circulated. One 
faction claimed that the Pope had been murdered by liberals in the church 
because of his intention to dismantle the changes of Vatican II; others 
asserted that Freemasons had infiltrated the church hierarchy and done him in. 
Yet other theories offered more specific names and motives, and some inevitably 
linked the affair to the Banco Ambrosiano scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Cornwell retreads ground covered by other investigators (books have appeared in 
several languages on the subject), but his account has the flair of a mystery 
novel. "The Vatican expected me to prove that John Paul I had not been poisoned 
by one of their own," he writes tantalizingly, but ". . . the evidence led me 
to a conclusion that seems to me more shameful even, and more tragic, than any 
of the conspiracy theories." He tracks down sources, reports conversations and 
muses on the facts, building his case as artfully as any detective whose method 
depends on analysis of human character. Without giving away secrets, the 
reviewer can say that Cornwell's story works because he manages to look behind 
the conspiracy theories at people's propensity to prefer complicated 
explanations to simple ones. In the end, he concludes, "John Paul I died 
scorned and neglected by the institution that existed to sustain him."

MERCHANTS COMPLAIN OF METRO RAIL DISRUPTION; 
</P>
<P>
DOWNTOWN: BUILDING THE SUBWAY HAS HURT BUSINESSES ALONG A STRETCH OF 7TH 
STREET. POOR LIGHTING AND BAD TRAFFIC HAVE DETERRED CUSTOMERS, RETAILERS SAY. 
</P>

<P>
Merchants in the heart of downtown Los Angeles are finding it difficult to get 
into the holiday spirit this year. 
</P>
<P>
In what should be their busiest season, the shopkeepers instead are coping with 
a decline in customers and an increase in vandalism, and they blame the 
Southern California Rapid Transit District. 
</P>
<P>
Metro Rail subway construction has snarled traffic in a two-block section of 
7th Street, between Figueroa and Hope streets, disrupting pedestrian access to 
stores, cafes and businesses. High fences seal off the construction zones and 
screen the storefronts from sight. To find the shops and showrooms, shoppers 
must navigate narrow pedestrian alleyways that are more like tunnels and barely 
wide enough for two people to pass. And at night, the merchants complain, 
hoodlums lurk in the dimly lit passageways. 
</P>
<P>
"This construction is killing our business," said Toni Ortega, manager of See's 
Candy store in the 700 block of 7th Street. In addition to fewer customers, she 
said, some sweet-toothed vandals -- hidden by the temporary fences -- broke 
into her shop three times in one recent week, smashing display windows and the 
glass front door to gain entry. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Metro Rail and the smaller-scale Long Beach Light Rail Line 
has caused problems in other commercial zones. But most transportation 
officials agree that this stretch of 7th Street, which has endured the 
construction for two years now, is by far the worst trouble spot. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown merchants warn that their problems might serve as a preview of what is 
to come to others as the massive Metro Rail is extended through some of Los 
Angeles' most densely populated neighborhoods into Hollywood and the San 
Fernando Valley. While they acknowledge that the disruption is the price to be 
paid for any major construction project, the shopkeepers complain that many of 
the problems caused by Metro Rail could have been avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Three small 7th Street businesses have folded since Metro Rail construction 
began. Court documents show the owner of one of the shops was $20,000 behind in 
his lease and was forced out of business because, he said, the construction 
barricades blocked customer access to him. 
</P>
<P>
Rapid Transit District officials acknowledge that construction work has 
hampered access and created problems. But the RTD contends it is doing what it 
can to help merchants survive the disruptions caused by the $48-million subway 
station project. The job, started nearly two years ago, is scheduled to be 
completed in September, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we've had many complaints," said Rebecca Barrantes, RTD director of 
governmental affairs. The complaints fall into four categories -- noise, dust, 
security and access, she said. "We know these have an impact on businesses. . . 
. We know their problems and have dealt with their individual complaints 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the country, big construction jobs like Metro Rail have been managed 
to mitigate the worst of the problems, said Elaine Stewart, a retail expert 
with the Los Angeles Central City Assn. For example, she said, work on the 
Portland Light Rail Line -- built through the heart of that Oregon city -- was 
shut down during the Christmas Holidays to help merchants in the construction 
zones. 
</P>
<P>
"In Portland, Seattle and other cities, the construction managers were very 
sensitive to pedestrian and retail activity," Stewart said. The RTD put up 
small signs at the street corners listing businesses that still operate there. 
But Stewart contends that the district should have done much more to ease the 
disruption. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart made it clear that the association and the merchants in the area 
strongly support Metro Rail. Their complaint is that the construction managers 
are not sensitive enough to the retailers' needs. 
</P>
<P>
The Metro Rail underground station at 7th and Flower streets will be the 
largest stop on the 17-mile subway that will link downtown Los Angeles to 
Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley. When completed, the station also will 
connect with the Long Beach Light Rail Line. 
</P>
<P>
Under the street, three train tunnels converge on the 80-foot deep cavern that 
will house the two-level station. The heart of the station, which is shaped 
like an X, is directly under the 7th and Flower intersection and extends more 
than a block in each direction. There was barely enough room between the 
buildings to excavate the enormous hole needed to build the station, engineers 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very big job in a very tight space," said Dan Riggs, project manager 
for the private engineering firm that supervises construction for RTD. Heavy 
timbers were used to roof the cavernous pit so that traffic could still move on 
the streets. He said that more than half the street and sidewalk, however, is 
needed for work sites, material storage and equipment parking -- bringing 
greater disruption for merchants. 
</P>
<P>
"Major jobs like this have major impacts," Riggs said. "We know we are causing 
problems, but we're working hard to get along with the merchants." 
</P>
<P>
Riggs said that the contractors voluntarily agreed to widen the sidewalk space 
from the minimum four feet required by the city up to five and six feet to 
increase pedestrian access. And, when merchants complained about the dark 
walkways, Riggs said the RTD authorized the purchase of higher intensity light 
bulbs for street lighting. 
</P>
<P>
On 7th Street, however, managers of Fowler Brothers -- Los Angeles' oldest book 
store and stationers -- are not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
Business is off 20% for the second year in a row and at Christmas that 
translates to about $50,000 for the month, according to store vice president 
Randall Clarke. Comparisons to the Dr. Seuss story "How the Grinch Stole 
Christmas" are quite appropriate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that RTD has done nothing to help out," Clarke said. "It's been 
total neglect and we feel defeated." 
</P>
<P>
The brighter bulbs didn't come close to solving the problem, Clarke said: "No 
way. It's still dark (in the walkways), we want floods, we need light to deter 
the hoodlums." 
</P>
<P>
A short way up the street, the 7th Street Bistro last week was hidden from view 
by piles of construction materials. Patrons trying to get to the upscale 
restaurant for lunch or dinner were forced to follow an intricate route through 
a back alley off of Wilshire Boulevard to reach the front door. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very bad situation," said chef and owner Laurent Quenioux. He estimated 
that the bistro's business was off $500,000 already this year, and the problem 
is worsening. He added: "They (RTD) can destroy our business." 
</P>
<P>
Other merchants complain that construction workers park cars and pickups on the 
job site and that huge storage containers are stacked high, blocking the view 
of their display windows. 
</P>
<P>
Riggs, the construction consultant, said the parking and storage areas were 
established according to Los Angeles City Department of Transportation 
guidelines and permits. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they have tried to work out some kind of balance between 
the needs of the Metro Rail contractors and the need to keep traffic flowing. 
However, city officials, contradicting Riggs, said the city did not intend for 
these areas to be used for vehicle parking or for storage. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a sore point between RTD . . . and us," said James Okazaki, a city 
transportation official. When city inspectors tried to get materials moved or 
parking restricted, the contractors and RTD protested. "We've had a running 
battle," Okazaki said, "and we sort of lost. It's been difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Across the street from Fowler's, at the big Broadway Plaza shopping mall and 
office complex, property manager Jon R. Bradford said the construction has the 
plaza hemmed in on three sides -- Hope, 7th and Flower streets. Half the street 
and all of the sidewalk along Flower Street has been turned into a storage 
yard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like our sidewalks open and for them to move that storage," Bradford 
said. He explained that before the RTD took over this section of Flower, it was 
a staging ground for construction crews building the Long Beach Light Rail 
tunnel into the 7th Street Station. The light rail project is managed by the 
Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. When the commission finished its 
tunnel job, the RTD took over, Bradford said. 
</P>
<P>
While he was critical of the RTD's "insensitivity," Bradford praised the county 
commission, saying it had been "very responsive" to the merchants' needs during 
construction of the tunnel. Unlike the RTD, he said, the commission and its 
contractors worked hard to minimize the impact of the construction on nearby 
businesses, including providing 24-hour private security guards to deter 
vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a lot of hand-holding with the merchants," said Robin McCarthy, the 
commission's community relations director. The commission staff also staged 
business promotions to attract customers during the last Christmas season, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The RTD wants to be more sensitive to the retailers' problems, said district 
spokeswoman Barrantes. "We're learning. We are planning to go into more 
mitigation on the next (construction) phase," she said, adding, "In the future, 
we want to avoid problems like 7th Street."

NAACP CHAPTER STARTLED BY RESIGNATION OF LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN and MARITA HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Willis Edwards, the controversial president of the Beverly Hills-Hollywood 
chapter of the NAACP, resigned his post Saturday night in a surprise 
announcement at the group's annual Image Awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards made the announcement in a written statement at the taping of the 22nd 
annual awards ceremony at the Wiltern Theatre, as members of a splinter group 
of the civil rights organization picketed outside calling for his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards, who headed the organization for eight years and brought a higher 
profile to the group through his ties with Hollywood celebrities and 
politicians such as Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, had become the target of 
sharp criticism from members of the splinter group. His critics accused him of 
deserting blacks' fight for equal rights, using his position instead to hobnob 
with the stars and draw attention to himself. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement printed in the event's program, Edwards said he was keeping a 
vow he made two years ago to quit his post once the NAACP chapter had developed 
"a strong bond with the (entertainment) industry" and the Image Awards 
ceremonies were regularly broadcast on television. He said he had now achieved 
his goals, saying he considered his "job done" and would now make way "for new 
ideas and for young leadership to take helm of the chapter." 
</P>
<P>
This fall, branch members accused Edwards of wrongfully accepting $25,000 for 
serving as co-executive producer of the 1988 Image Awards. The awards honor 
those who have presented positive images of blacks in entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
In September, the branch voted to demand Edwards' resignation on the grounds 
that he violated bylaws of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People prohibiting officers from accepting money for group-related projects, 
said Connie Watson, who once challenged him for the chapter presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards denied any wrongdoing, claiming that he had received permission from 
the group's national headquarters in Baltimore to accept the $25,000 payment. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote that first vice president Sandra J. Evers-Manly would assume his 
position.

NINE JAIL VISITORS BECOME 'GUESTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A trip to visit relatives and friends at Biscailuz Center Jail in East Los 
Angeles turned out to be a one-way trip for nine visitors Saturday when a 
random search by authorities uncovered various weapons and drugs in their 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
Those arrested were among 131 visitors who were searched during a six-hour 
period. Trained dogs were used to check their vehicles for narcotics while 
officers frisked passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Searches of visitors and their vehicles are conducted randomly at jails 
throughout Los Angeles County in an effort to deter visitors from furnishing 
contraband to prisoners, said Sheriff's Department spokesman Dean Scoville. He 
added that signs posted on jail premises state that visitors are subject to 
such searches. 
</P>
<P>
Five men and four women were arrested on various narcotics and weapons charges, 
including possession of brass knuckles and an 8-inch survival knife. Most of 
the drugs were in small amounts. One of the men was arrested for violating his 
parole, which requires that he not visit jail facilities, Scoville said.

SOARING INTERCHANGE ON CENTURY FREEWAY TO BE ONE OF A KIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There never has been anything quite like the high-flying, $135-million traffic 
interchange being built in South-Central Los Angeles to link the new Century 
Freeway with a remodeled Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
With the top lanes soaring 120 feet in the air -- higher than a 10-story 
building -- the interchange is the biggest, tallest, most costly traffic 
structure yet built by California Department of Transportation, engineers 
report. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the state's traffic engineers have integrated three modes 
of transportation -- light-rail trains, high-occupancy vehicles and individual 
cars -- into one giant intersection. 
</P>
<P>
The trains will run along the median strip of the $2-billion Century Freeway, 
traveling east from the Los Angeles International Airport about 17 miles to 
Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
The five-level maze of soaring and curving freeway lanes will feature: 
</P>
<P>
* A railroad station for passengers who want to transfer from the east-west 
light-rail trains to north-south transitway buses operating along the Harbor 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
* A bus stop two levels below the train station, with stairways, escalators and 
elevators to link the rail and bus stations. 
</P>
<P>
* A park-and-ride lot off Figueroa Street that is connected by a walkway to a 
mid-level mezzanine in the interchange. The mezzanine will have bus and train 
ticket vending machines, route maps and commuter information. 
</P>
<P>
* An interchange within the interchange for High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) 
diamond lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The design of the Century-Harbor Interchange breaks with the past. Some 
engineers are suggesting that it may become as famous as the Four Level 
Interchange in downtown Los Angeles, which revolutionized freeway interchange 
design 36 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a first-ever (design). It will be very interesting to see how it works 
out," said Wolfgang Homburger of the UC Institute of Transportation Studies in 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
The test, he said, will be how willing commuters are to transfer from car to 
bus to rail transportation at the interchange, with all of its noise and smog. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually there will be nine miles of cloverleaf loops, transition lanes and 
connecting roads built into the interchange that will be a mile and a half wide 
and nearly as long. Right now, however, it looks more like a huge puzzle being 
assembled a piece at a time, an on-ramp here, a crossover there. 
</P>
<P>
When completed, the Century Freeway will cross four north-south freeways, but 
none of the other new interchanges will be as complex, or quite as costly as 
the Century-Harbor Interchange, said Caltrans engineer Charles J. O'Connell. 
</P>
<P>
Not only will rail commuters be able to transfer to buses, but buses, vans and 
car pools will zip along in their own exclusive lanes through "an interchange 
within an interchange," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Harbor Freeway -- complete with its own new high-occupancy-vehicle bus and 
van-pool lanes -- will run through a wide trench at the bottom of the 
interchange. 
</P>
<P>
The bus stops, mezzanine and train stations will be stacked in the levels above 
the Harbor Freeway, amid the looping, curving traffic lanes that will angle off 
in all directions, each of them designed to keep traffic moving at 55 m.p.h., 
O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
Constructed to withstand a 7.0-magnitude earthquake on the Newport-Inglewood 
Fault, the structure is being built of steel and concrete that is designed to 
sway, rather than stand rigid against a quake's shock, O'Connell explained. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm comfortable with design we have. . . . It can withstand the worst quake 
that's likely to hit the area," O'Connell said. 
</P>
<P>
PROFILE OF A 'SUPER FREEWAY' 
</P>
<P>
The $2-billion Century Freeway will include not only traffic lanes, but also 
exclusive lanes for van and car pools and a light-rail line. At the Harbor 
Freeway intersection, the interchange will include parking areas, train 
stations and bus depots to allow commuters to transfer from cars to trains or 
buses. Commuters in car- or van-pool lanes will be able to enter and leave the 
interchange without crossing general traffic lanes.

DOUG SCOVIL DIES AFTER WORKOUT; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: THE FORMER SAN DIEGO STATE FOOTBALL COACH SUFFERS A HEART ATTACK IN 
PHILADELPHIA, WHERE HE WAS AN ASSISTANT WITH THE EAGLES. SCOVIL, 62, WAS 
CREDITED WITH MOLDING THE 1986 WAC CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doug Scovil, who coached the San Diego State football team from 1981 to 1985 
and was quarterback coach for the Philadelphia Eagles, died Saturday of a heart 
attack at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Scovil, 62, apparently had just finished his daily workout with a stationary 
bike ride and had taken a few steps when he fell to the floor in the team's 
training room, the Eagles said. 
</P>
<P>
Backup tight end Dave Little found Scovil lying on the floor, and team members 
tried to revive the coach with CPR for about 10 to 15 minutes. He was 
pronounced dead by Dr. Jeff Gryn at 1:04 p.m. at Methodist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Scovil was 24-32-3 at SDSU but was instrumental in building the 1986 Aztec team 
that won the school's only Western Athletic Conference championship and a berth 
in the Holiday Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"All of those players were brought in by Doug," said Denny Stolz, who succeeded 
Scovil and coached the Aztecs for three seasons. "I took them over from him. He 
had a great deal to do with the success of that 1986 championship team. He was 
able to get them to that point, and we just finished it." 
</P>
<P>
Said SDSU President Thomas Day: "I am very saddened at the passing of Doug 
Scovil. I have nothing but fine feelings about him. Doug was doing what he 
enjoyed to do and doing it very well. I would like to express sympathy on 
behalf of the university to his wife and family." 
</P>
<P>
Webster Slaughter, a starting wide receiver for the Cleveland Browns, played 
for Scovil at SDSU in 1984 and '85 and caught caught 82 passes for 1,071 yards 
and 10 touchdowns as a senior. He said Scovil's pro-style offense helped 
prepare him for the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a lot to do with me succeeding," Slaughter said. "He really knew 
everything about offense." 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter said he has kept in contact with Scovil through phone conversations 
since leaving SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a real nice guy," he said. "He really didn't say too much, but when he 
said something, you respected it." 
</P>
<P>
Scovil had a national reputation for working with quarterbacks, most recently 
with the Eagles' Randall Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, his first season with the Eagles, Scovil was credited with playing a 
vital role in the development of Cunningham, then a second-year player, 
correcting a hitch in his delivery and overseeing his progression from a 
third-down specialist to a starter. 
</P>
<P>
Scovil was an assistant at Brigham Young from 1976-77 and again from 1979 to 
1981 before becoming head coach at San Diego State. At BYU, Scovil worked with 
future pros Gifford Nielsen and Marc Wilson as well as Charger quarterback Jim 
McMahon. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy was a tremendous coach, a real brilliant offensive mind, and I enjoyed 
playing for him," McMahon said. "That's a real shock. I'm really sorry for his 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Eagles Coach Buddy Ryan had known Scovil since Ryan was defensive coordinator 
and Scovil was head coach at Pacific in 1967. They were also assistants with 
the Chicago Bears under Neill Armstrong in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a great coach who meant a great deal to the Eagles," Ryan said. "He did 
a great job with Randall. 
</P>
<P>
"Doug will be sorely missed. We'll dedicate the rest of the season to him and 
hopefully it will go to the (Super Bowl) 28th of January. " 
</P>
<P>
The players will wear black arm bands when they play host to the Dallas Cowboys 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Scovil played quarterback for Stockton Junior College in California and the 
College of the Pacific before beginning his coaching career with four seasons 
at a San Francisco high school and five at San Mateo Junior College in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Scovil was an assistant at Navy for three seasons starting in 1963, when Roger 
Staubach won the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
He worked for the San Francisco 49ers from 1970 to 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Scovil is survived by his wife, Enid, and three children, Doug Jr., Randy and 
Sarah. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements were pending Saturday evening.

CARSON CRUSHES CRENSHAW IN 4-A SEMIFINAL, 58-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS

<TEXT>
<P>
There definitely was something missing from Friday night's L.A. City Section 
4-A semifinal between Carson and Crenshaw at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
A football game, to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's 58-7 drubbing of the hapless Cougars was far from being a game. A 
joke, maybe, but not a game. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, they played four quarters. But the last period was kept on a running 
clock. It was that bad. 
</P>
<P>
"It's boring," said a Carson fan, her interest waning as the Colts raced to a 
42-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter in the press box quipped: "If it was a fight, they'd stop it." 
</P>
<P>
But this was football, and the game must go on. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fun in the first half," Carson Coach Gene Vollnogle said, "but I would 
have liked to get on the bus at halftime and go home." 
</P>
<P>
That goes for the rest of us, Gene. 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle, though, did stick around long enough to congratulate his team for 
winning its 10th consecutive game and putting Carson in the City final for the 
ninth straight year. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts (10-1) will play Dorsey (10-3) for the second time this season at 
7:30 Friday night at El Camino College. Carson beat the Dons, 29-7, in Pacific 
League play. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's semifinal was also a rematch. Carson had defeated Crenshaw, 39-12, in 
a league game. The Cougars, however, were confident they could reverse that 
decision after posting playoff victories over San Fernando, 27-24, and Taft of 
Woodland Hills, 27-13. 
</P>
<P>
"They were pumped up (during warm-ups) and said they were going to beat us 
physically," Carson quarterback Armin Youngblood said. "They said they were 
going to blitz us like Bishop Amat." 
</P>
<P>
Carson lost its season opener, 24-23, to Bishop Amat, which was successful with 
a stunting defense that tackled Youngblood for 35 yards in losses. 
</P>
<P>
But the only quarterback running for his life Friday was Crenshaw's Derrick 
Williams. He was sacked six times for 81 yards in losses, including a safety by 
defensive end Marcus Long to open the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
When Williams was able to get off a pass, he misfired most of the time. The 
senior was five for 21 with two interceptions, both of which were returned for 
touchdowns by linebacker Isiah Hall (12 yards in the first quarter) and 
defensive back Tarriel Hopper (38 yards in the second quarter). 
</P>
<P>
The only competition on the field was the scoring between Carson's various 
units. The final tally: Colt offense 27, Colt defense 24, Colt special teams 7. 
</P>
<P>
Youngblood, who said he audibilized 60 percent of the time, completed 10 of 17 
passes for 165 yards and three touchdowns. He is the school's single-season 
record holder with 2,300 yards and 30 TDs passing. 
</P>
<P>
"I was having a good time," Youngblood said. "But after a while, it began to 
drag on. I wanted to have a running clock to get it over." 
</P>
<P>
As is the case many times after blowouts, the losing coach accused the winning 
coach of pouring it on. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw's Robert Garrett was upset that Vollnogle, who asked for a running 
clock at halftime, called a pass play on a double reverse with Carson leading, 
44-7, midway through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a slap in the face," Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, a trick play was probably in poor taste. But it should 
be pointed out that the pass from wide receiver Michael Ross to running back 
Abdul Muhammad lost two yards and was one of only five passes attempted by 
Carson in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
If Garrett needs to blame someone for Crenshaw's embarrassment, he should look 
in the mirror. His team was ill-prepared to play. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if it would be difficult to get Carson prepared to play after two 
consecutive playoff blowouts, Vollnogle said: "We're playing for the City 
championship now. We'll be better yet." 
</P>
<P>
As was the case last season, when Carson won the 4-A title with a 55-7 victory 
over Banning, the Colts seem to get better each week. 
</P>
<P>
In the last nine games, since conference play began, they have outscored their 
opponents, 367-43. In two playoff games the margin is 89-7. 
</P>
<P>
And the prospect of meeting Dorsey again has at least one Colt excited. 
</P>
<P>
"I really want to play Dorsey again because I had a bad game against them," 
Youngblood said. "I want a second chance." 
</P>
<P>
After a strong showing in the Pacific Shores Tournament, Morningside's 
basketball team moves up to a higher level of competition this week in the 
Tournament of Champions at Ocean View High in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs open the 16-team tournament at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday against Los 
Alamitos, ranked No. 2 in The Times' preseason Orange County poll and led by 
6-foot-9 center Robert Conlisk. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament also features Long Beach Poly, ranked No. 1 in the Southern 
Section 5-AA Division; Mater Dei, ranked No. 1 in both 5-A and Orange County; 
Loyola, ranked No. 2 in 5-A; Capistrano Valley, ranked No. 3 in 5-A and Orange 
County, and Lakewood, which reached the Pacific Shores final against 
Morningside and is ranked No. 4 in 5-AA. 
</P>
<P>
The only other South Bay entry is Westchester, which faces West Covina at 4 
p.m. Monday. The championship game will be played 8:30 Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills, which took Morningside into overtime before losing, 76-68, in 
the semifinals of the Pacific Shores Tournament, begins play in the Beverly 
Hills Tournament at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday against Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans received good news Friday when X-rays revealed that center Roger 
Hendrix suffered only a sprained right thumb against Morningside. Coach Cliff 
Warren said the 6-5 junior is on a day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard, which finished the Pacific Shores Tournament with a decisive 86-71 
win over Palos Verdes and a 3-1 record, also is entered in the Beverly Hills 
Tournament and faces Notre Dame of Sherman Oaks at 4:30 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard beat Rolling Hills in the finals last year.

'GO SLOW' GARDENA RUNNERS CLUB IS FAST COMPANY; 
</P>
<P>
TRACK: DAN ASHIMINE RUNS AN AUTO REPAIR SHOP IN GARDENA. HE ALSO HAS AN UNUSUAL 
APPROACH TO TRAINING DISTANCE RUNNERS. MEMBERS OF THE CLUB HE FOUNDED SEVEN 
YEARS AGO ARE PROVING IT WORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With every stride the pace seemed more dull for jogger Dan Ashimine, who likes 
his running that way. 
</P>
<P>
It was almost noon. Along with 15 members of his Gardena Valley Runners club, 
Ashimine exited Crenshaw Boulevard at El Camino College, part of a 10-mile 
circle that begins and ends at Ashimine's auto repair shop in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
Founder, coach and sometimes surrogate father to about 60 members of the club, 
Ashimine insists on a slow pace for all his runners. On this run there were no 
mad dashes, no wind sprints. The joggers, some in the street, others on the 
sidewalk, even stopped at red signal lights, talking among themselves as they 
went. 
</P>
<P>
Ashimine's approach to distance running, which he calls "discipline training," 
is unorthodox. But as the Gardena Valley Runners post more victories in amateur 
street races, his ideas are drawing more attention. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Ashimine has no formal training in track or road running, but most 
of his runners say his ideas have helped them post personal-best times. Said 
Deke Holgate, a veteran distance runner who does public relations for the 
Redondo Beach Super Bowl 5-K and 10-K Run: "The club is just one man's 
personality. He took what he's learned in running and applied it to others." 
</P>
<P>
Ashimine took up distance running a decade ago as a release for the tension of 
running a small business. He has a simple philosophy: "We start off easy, and I 
peak (the runners) at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
Years of pounding the streets around the South Bay on his own convinced 
Ashimine that conventional training did not work for the average runner, so in 
1982 he founded the Gardena Valley club. Each member pays a one-time fee of 
$15. Ashimine encourages average Joes to join. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take just about anybody," he said, "but they have to be nice." 
</P>
<P>
Ashimine believes in daily street workouts of 10 to 20 miles. Each weekday at 
11 a.m., members gather at his auto shop, behind an old house on 168th Street 
near Normandie Avenue. The club headquarters is a small wooden shed paneled 
with snapshots of the Runners in action. 
</P>
<P>
From here they leave on a two-hour jaunt along 190th Street to the Redondo 
Beach Pier, or through the industrial section of Gardena into Torrance and 
around El Camino College and Alondra Park. 
</P>
<P>
Each runner is thinly clad in running shorts, lightweight shoes without socks, 
and distinctive yellow T-shirts and tank tops bearing the Gardena Valley 
Runners logo. On a recent run, the yellow shirts seemed almost as brilliant as 
the plentiful December sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
Along the street-racing circuit, those yellow shirts are becoming increasingly 
familiar. The no-name Gardena Valley Runners have made a name for themselves by 
dominating local 5-K and 10-K runs and marathons in the past few years. At the 
annual Torrance Turkey Trot on Thanksgiving day, the first six finishers wore 
yellow shirts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real strong club, very visible, but they have no big-name runners," 
said Don Franken, a professional track promoter who handles some of the world's 
elite runners. 
</P>
<P>
The club's successes have made Ashimine something of a track guru. 
</P>
<P>
"If he started out with a famous miler and got him a world record, than he 
would have received the recognition he deserves," said Holgate. "But he's 
starting with guys that aren't even known." 
</P>
<P>
Yet as word of Ashimine's unusual training philosophy spreads, top-flight 
runners have begun to seek him out. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't attract those kind of guys unless you are doing something right," 
Holgate said. 
</P>
<P>
Road-racing experts such as Holgate and Franken see the Gardena Valley Runners 
at a crossroads. Already, Ashimine has trained distance runners from Europe, 
Africa and Mexico. Several top performers in this year's Southern Section CIF 
high school finals are members of the club. And recently Ashimine acquired two 
road racers from Kenya, Sam Obwocha and William Musyoki. Both rank among the 
world's 10 best, according to Holgate. 
</P>
<P>
"If I keep pluggin' with this system, I think that I might be able to change a 
few things," Ashimine said. 
</P>
<P>
The shop, down a driveway under a neon sign, is hidden behind the old house and 
its chain-link fence. On a recent morning, the pungent odor of axle grease 
filled the air. Mercedes-Benzes, Mazdas and Chevrolets were lined up three deep 
waiting for service. Ashimine, clad in faded jeans, tennis shoes and one of 
those yellow T-shirts, wiped his hands clean. 
</P>
<P>
"Have trouble finding the place?" he said. "Most people do the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Soon runners began arriving to warm up for their daily jog. 
</P>
<P>
Ashimine took a seat in the Runners' office, next to the service bay. The only 
hint of the pressure he says he feels as a businessman was that telltale sign 
of the auto mechanic: black grime under his fingernails. All he wanted to talk 
about was running. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm mad," Ashimine said. "We have the best runners in the world in the United 
States, but we have no world-class results. I attribute that to our training 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"We shoot for the short-term goal. We go out to win a marathon in two years. It 
takes most guys seven or eight years. That's why in the Olympics you never see 
a young guy winning. They're all 30 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Ashimine admits that he's "just a little guy" in world running circles. But he 
said: "I expect to change the whole system. There's no money in it. I got to do 
it for the love of the sport." 
</P>
<P>
Having the two Kenyans in his camp has boosted Ashimine's stock. And five of 
his runners qualified for the U.S. Olympic marathon trials. He is now grooming 
several athletes for money races in this country and in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I will change things strictly by example," he said. "I want the results to do 
the talking." 
</P>
<P>
Others will talk about Ashimine, who prefers a low-key approach to coming off 
as cocky. Said Obwocha, who is attempting a comeback after an auto accident in 
Dallas two years ago: "Dan's not a world-class coach, but you listen to him and 
do what he says and it works." 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Sullivan, who calls herself an average runner, continues to post personal 
bests. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe you can train so slow and still get stronger and stronger," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ashimine allows his pupils a maximum of 90 road miles a week. Each passes 
slowly, but on race day he gives each individual a goal and tells him to turn 
up the burner. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't fatigue or hurt anything, yet it makes your muscles strong and ready 
for speed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Rosas of San Pedro, who recently won the Culver City Marathon, is 
another Ashimine disciple. His performances are approaching world-class status. 
He runs an average marathon in a little over two hours and 18 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a little club, the only club in the United States of its kind," Rosas 
said. "There is no pressure to perform. When you are ready, you are ready. Dan 
understands that, and he's right there for you all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Rosas, who at one time was under contract to a major shoe manufacturer, said he 
became disgusted with the treatment he received. 
</P>
<P>
"You never saw or talked to anyone in the company," he said. "All you saw was 
shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Rosas and others say an important aspect of the Gardena Valley Runners is its 
family atmosphere, which Ashimine believes inspires runners to set personal 
records. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone here cares for you, and I like that," Obwocha said as he chatted with 
other club members at the auto shop. All seemed to enjoy the others' company. 
</P>
<P>
Kidded Harold Letting, 36, of Redondo Beach: "We're all really a bunch of 
snots. All of us hate to get beat by good runners, so we pull for each other. 
I'm running faster now than when I was in high school." 
</P>
<P>
Ashimine enjoys working with average runners. 
</P>
<P>
"In a club like this you have to have balance," he said. "The slow people, the 
average person, is the heart of the club. They support it; they do all the work 
for the others." 
</P>
<P>
Ashimine receives funding from private donors, whom he refused to name. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all doctors and lawyers in the community who do it just for the love 
of sport," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Franken says it's a shame that more clubs don't use the family approach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not IBM or Pepsi or a generic name club," he said of Gardena Valley. "But 
it's an important club. Those are the things that keep track going. What 
(Ashimine) does is a real positive effort for the community." 
</P>
<P>
The Runners took a water break at the baseball fields at Alondra Park, rounded 
El Camino College once more and went east on busy Manhattan Beach Boulevard to 
Crenshaw Boulevard, where they turned back toward Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
Some had removed their shirts to take advantage of the warm sunshine. Ashimine, 
his yellow shirt dripping with sweat, led the group slowly south along the 
sidewalk, an hour and a half after the run began. 
</P>
<P>
At the Crenshaw Boulevard parking lot at El Camino, Ashimine stopped and let 
the others go on without him. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks for everything," he said to a reporter who was following the group in a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
A smile crossed his face. The yellow shirts were growing smaller on the horizon 
as they turned east on 168th Street. But there was no need to hurry, he 
thought. He'd catch up to them in his own time. 
</P>

SURGE LIFTS DAMEWORTH TO NATIONAL TITLE;

<P>
CROSS-COUNTRY: AGOURA HIGH SENIOR CONCLUDES AN UNBEATEN SEASON BY PULLING AWAY 
TO A 50-METER VICTORY IN THE KINNEY CHAMPIONSHIPS.

Judgment Day arrived Saturday for Bryan Dameworth, the whiz kid whose 
undefeated season was put to a test in the Kinney national cross-country 
championships at Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Maris, a senior from White River High in Buckley, Wash., stayed with the 
Agoura High senior for the first 2 3/4 miles but could not keep pace thereafter 
as Dameworth won in 14 minutes, 49.9 seconds over the 5,000-meter course. Maris 
was second in 15:00.9. 
</P>
<P>
Maris tailed Dameworth and Teddy Mitchell of Lyman High in Longwood, Fla., at 
one mile and Dameworth and Maris were tied for first at two miles (9:39). But 
Dameworth took control in the last quarter-mile with a closing surge to win by 
50 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just going to see who would run out of fuel first," said Dameworth, 
the fifth California runner in the meet's 11-year history to win the national 
championship and first since Marc Davis (San Diego High) in 1986. "I was 
concentrating on hanging in there as long as I could. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared. He's really tough." 
</P>
<P>
Dameworth, who had finished fourth in the 1988 national final, became the 
second Valley-area runner to win the title. Eric Reynolds won the 1982 
championship in Orlando, Fla., as a Camarillo High senior. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover senior Eliazar Herrera ran a strong final mile to finish 11th (15:25.2) 
after completing two miles (10:01) in 23rd. 
</P>
<P>
"I just thought that it was my last race and I wanted to place as high as 
possible," Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran what I could the last mile, all out." 
</P>
<P>
Arroyo Grande junior Louie Quintana, who shadowed Dameworth with second-place 
finishes in the Southern Section 2-A Division, state Division I and West 
regional championships, placed third in 15:10.0. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' competition, Agoura junior Deena Drossin faded from fourth at the 
mile mark (5:25) and finished 13th in 18:14.3. 
</P>
<P>
The season-closing meet was a disappointment for Drossin, who had hoped for a 
top-five finish after 11th- and 17th-place efforts the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't have it, I guess," Drossin said. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake's Jeannie Rothman, eighth in the West regional, finished 16th in 
18:32.7.

POOR FOUL SHOOTING COSTLY TO MASTER'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Were it not for some foul shooting that was indeed foul shooting Saturday 
night, The Master's College might have pulled out a win comparable to a 
Washington Generals' victory over the Harlem Globetrotters. 
</P>
<P>
Master's built a four-point halftime lead and held a two-point edge with less 
than two minutes remaining but could not stave off Westmont College in a 59-55 
NAIA District 3 loss at home before 850 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Westmont won for the 26th time in the schools' 27 meetings, but a miserable 
10-of-22 performance at the free-throw line did not help Master's. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if we make our foul shots, we certainly had plenty of opportunities to 
win," Master's Coach Mel Hankinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Master's (6-4) was nursing a 52-50 lead when Westmont's Noel Matthews made a 
three-point basket. Teammate Peter Partain followed with a three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
The Master's Tom Bruner missed the front end of a one-and-one with 35 seconds 
left, but the Mustangs had a chance to tie with nine seconds left. However, 
Jason Webster's short jump shot skittered off the rim. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Hankinson was pleased with his team's performance against Westmont 
(6-1), a perennial District 3 power. 
</P>
<P>
"This program has come a light-year in just two years," Hankinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Master's lost by 19 points to Westmont last season, but Hankinson has a player, 
guard Damon Greer, who he thinks could close the gap. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Damon Greer would have certainly been worth three points," Hankinson 
said. Greer, a transfer from San Jose State and a former Cleveland High star, 
will become eligible at the end of the semester on Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
After learning that the final score was 59-55, however, Hankinson decided that 
"Damon would have been good for five points tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Bruner led Master's with 18 points and Webster added 17 but struggled with his 
shooting, making only six of 16 from the field and four of nine free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews and forward Chris Hahs led Westmont with 16 and 14 points.

MORNINGSIDE WINS PACIFIC SHORES TOURNEY

<P>
Morningside High won its seventh Pacific Shores basketball tournament Saturday 
night by defeating Lakewood, 85-72, Saturday night at Redondo Union High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Tyrone Paul, who led Morningside with 18 points in Saturday's 
game, was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside got a scare, however, at the beginning of the third quarter, when 
Lakewood outscored the Monarchs 14-3 to shave 12 points off a 15-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with 2:43 left in the quarter and the Monarchs leading by only 49-46, 
Morningside center Jeff Crowe was called for a technical foul after arguing an 
official's call. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pretty upset, but the coaches told us to have poise," Crowe said. "We 
settled down and we got back in synch." 
</P>
<P>
In the rest of the third quarter, Morningside went on to outscore Lakewood, 
18-6. 
</P>
<P>
A similar run in the opening minutes of the game, when Paul had two breakaway 
dunks, staked Morningside to a 17-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt pretty good tonight," Paul said, noting that his team had been 
eliminated in the semifinals of last year's tournament. "This team has got a 
winning feeling. Last year we got to the door. This year we're going inside." 
</P>
<P>
Crowe had 13 points, eight of them in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
All-tournament selection Andre Miller, a senior forward for Lakewood, had a 
game-high 27 points. Lakewood forward Terrence O'Kelley had 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the third-place game, Carson beat Rolling Hills 82-73. Senior forward Bobby 
Kelly led the Colts with 27 points. Roger Hendrix led Rolling Hills with 25.

The Loyola Marymount women's basketball team suffered its first loss at home 
this season, falling to Cal Poly Pomona, 82-71, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, now 2-3, fought back from a 13-point deficit late in the first half 
to tie the game at 36-all going into halftime. 
</P>
<P>
After the lead changed hands several times, Loyola forged ahead and led by five 
points with 4:16 left. 
</P>
<P>
But Cal Poly (5-0), sparked by guard Serenda Valdez, ran off 11 straight points 
and pulled away in the final minutes. Valdez scored eight points in the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona All-American Niki Bracken led all scorers with 34 points, 20 in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola was led by its guard tandem of Kristen Bruich, who had 21 points, and 
Lynn Flanagan, who had 19. Flanagan led the Lions' second-half charge, scoring 
17 points after intermission, most of them while Loyola built a 67-62 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions, who had been 2-0 at home, play host to Arizona State at 3 p.m. 
today. ALAN DROOZ

CORRELLI DIRECTS ALEMANY TO WIN IN FINAL

<P>
Sparked by the play of tournament most valuable player Rachel Correlli, Alemany 
High rallied from an early seven-point deficit to upset Palmdale, 46-41, in the 
championship game Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Correlli pulled down seven rebounds and scored 12 points, including a 25-foot 
three-point basket at the halftime buzzer to give Alemany a 28-24 lead. The 
Indians trailed, 20-13, early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany (3-2) led, 41-33, with a little less than four minutes to play, but 
Palmdale (3-1) rallied to within four after Karee Bonde, who finished with a 
game-high 14 points, hit a three-point shot. Gina Shigamatsu made two free 
throws to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany's Sarah Guziel scored nine points and blocked seven shots and was named 
to the all-tournament team. Palmdale's Nicole Coupland, who scored 11 points 
and pulled down six rebounds in the final, also was named to the all-tournament 
team. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks 50, Camarillo 32 -- Michele Palmisano scored 13 points and 
grabbed seven rebounds to lead the Lancers (2-2) to a third-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
Hart 53, Canyon 36 -- Sara Wilson and Anjanette Dionne combined for 38 points 
to lead Hart (3-1) to the consolation title.

FAIRCHILD IS QUEEN OF THE HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On Morley Field's cross-country course, site of Saturday's Kinney National high 
school championships, there is one obstacle that runners find particularly 
bearish -- the Pershing Avenue hill. 
</P>
<P>
It's otherwise known as The Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The Hill is a steep incline up a dirt portion of the course that continues for 
a full city block. It usually weeds out the also-rans. No one ever kicks on the 
hill; it usually works the other way around, and the hill kicks them. 
</P>
<P>
At least that's the way it was until Saturday, when Melody Fairchild, a slight 
5-foot-2, 95-pound junior from Boulder, Colo., decided The Hill was her ally. 
</P>
<P>
Fairchild, who hung back from the lead pack in the early going of the girls' 
race, made her move at the bottom of The Hill and overtook the early 
pace-setters at the top. She went on to win in 17 minutes 05.5 seconds, more 
than seven seconds faster than second-place Megan Thompson of Florissant, Mo. 
(17:12.7). 
</P>
<P>
"I love hills," Fairchild said after catching her breath. "I'm proud that I 
live in Boulder, Colo., which is known for hills. I like to think hills are my 
strong point." 
</P>
<P>
Well, she at least convinced Thompson, who wasn't so sure of Fairchild's 
running ability going into the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anyone who doesn't look like a runner run like Melody did 
today," Thompson said. "Runners are tall and lanky, she's so short. But she has 
so much power in her legs . . . she amazes me." 
</P>
<P>
Fairchild has heard it all before but insists height is not a prerequisite to 
running successfully. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm determined to prove that size doesn't make a difference," she said. "It 
doesn't matter how long your legs are but how big your heart is." 
</P>
<P>
It was Fairchild's second appearance at the Kinney. Last year, she finished 
second to Celeste Susnis of Wheatfield, Ind. This year, Susnis, a senior, 
placed fifth at 17:39.2 behind Carole Zajac of Pittsburgh, Pa. (17:22.9) and 
Sarah Schwald of Spokane, Wash. (17:35.3).

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: HOW MUCH IN PAYMENTS CAN SINGLE PERSON AFFORD IN BUYING 
A HOUSE?

QUESTION: I am single, earning about $36,000 per year, and want to buy a house. 
But I'm confused as to how large a house I can buy. I have almost $10,000 in 
savings, and my mother will help me with an additional down payment if 
necessary. I would like to buy a modest house. How large a house can I afford? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: You ask a very difficult question to which there is no exact answer. 
Each mortgage lender has different loan qualification rules. The toughest 
lenders who sell their loans to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have fixed, 
arbitrary rules. 
</P>
<P>
These lenders only approve mortgages that take up to 28% of gross family 
income. But the most flexible portfolio lenders approve loans requiring 
payments up to 40% or more of income. 
</P>
<P>
As a general rule, with a typical down payment you can afford to buy a home 
priced up to three times your annual gross income. Depending on your credit 
history, income and the loan interest rate, you should easily be able to obtain 
a mortgage requiring up to 33%, or more of your income for payments. 
</P>
<P>
My suggestion is to first start shopping for a mortgage, then look at houses. 
Most reputable mortgage lenders will give you a firm, written loan commitment 
valid for up to 45 days so you'll know what maximum mortgage you can get and 
how much down payment will be required, subject only to appraisal of the home 
you decide to buy. 
</P>
<P>
How Could Appraiser Have Been So Wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Q: Before we put our home up for sale, my husband insisted that we have a 
professional appraisal made. After we did that, as you often suggest, we 
interviewed several local realty agents about listing our home for sale. 
</P>
<P>
We didn't tell the realty agents about the appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
But the agents estimated our home was worth from about $7,000 to $12,000 more 
than the appraisal. After checking each agent's references, we gave one of the 
agents a 60-day listing. In late September, the house sold for close to the 
full asking price. 
</P>
<P>
While we were very pleased with the professionalism of the realty agents, we 
feel the $250 we paid for the appraisal was a total waste of money. Not only 
was the appraisal almost $10,000 below our home's actual selling price, but we 
learned later the appraiser used sales prices of other nearby houses to value 
our home but they really weren't as nice as ours. 
</P>
<P>
When we asked for a refund of our $250, the appraiser was very rude. I told the 
banker who recommended him to us and he said that appraiser had been coming in 
very low on appraisals recently. How can an appraiser be so wrong? 
</P>
<P>
A: Until a sale takes place, a professional appraiser can only make an educated 
guess as to a property's market value. Appraisers rarely are criticized for 
making low appraisals but high appraisals often lead to trouble if buyers, 
sellers and lenders rely on too-optimistic valuations. 
</P>
<P>
Appraisal is an art, not a science. Even experienced appraisers make mistakes. 
To help improve the quality of appraisals, a new federal law requires each 
state to create new appraisal licensing standards within two years. 
</P>
<P>
If the states fail to do so, the federal government will create national 
appraisal qualifications. In my opinion, this is a long overdue reform to clean 
up the appraisal industry, which is far too easy to enter. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, when the new licensing standards are implemented within a few years, 
the quality of appraisals will greatly increase. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Usually Not Liable for Opinions 
</P>
<P>
Q: We bought our home in a new subdivision about two years ago. The realty 
agent showed us where a new nearby shopping center, schools and parks were 
planned. She also said we would be in a growing area where the values of homes 
were sure to increase at least 10% per year. 
</P>
<P>
But none of that happened. The only "shopping center" built so far consists of 
a convenience store and a gas station. We have to drive about 10 miles to a 
supermarket. The schools and parks haven't materialized either. As a result, I 
doubt we could sell our home for the price we paid. Do you think we should sue 
the realty agent for misrepresentation? 
</P>
<P>
A: You can't blame the realty agent for the lack of construction on the planned 
shopping center, schools and parks. As for the agent's statement that the area 
was growing and homes would appreciate 10% annually in market value, that was 
probably an opinion rather than a factual statement. Unless the realty agent 
promised the events would happen, the opinion statements made don't create 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
Seller Need Not OK Finance Plan Change 
</P>
<P>
Q: A major reason we are selling our home is to take a small down payment and 
then carry back a first mortgage to provide retirement income. Our realty agent 
had no trouble finding a buyer who offered us close to our full asking price 
and we agreed to take back a mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
But after about two weeks the buyers said they had changed their minds and want 
to get a VA mortgage, which requires nothing down. This will foul up our 
retirement income plans. The real estate agent says we must agree to the 
change. Must we? 
</P>
<P>
A: Of course not. When you listed your home for sale, I presume you stated in 
the listing that you wanted a small down payment and would carry back a 
mortgage for the balance of the sales price. After you accepted the first 
offer, you were under no obligation to agree to the requested VA mortgage 
change in sales terms. 
</P>
<P>
Your buyers are obligated to complete the purchase as agreed and will be liable 
to you for any breach of contract damages if they don't close the sale on 
schedule. Please consult a real estate attorney for full details. 
</P>
<P>
No House Is Perfect, So Quit Complaining 
</P>
<P>
Q: Almost six months ago, we bought our first home. The seller told us about a 
few defects, such as sluggish drains and a neighbor's barking dog. But about a 
month after we moved in we noticed leaks around the skylight in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out the skylight was installed improperly and there is dry rot around 
the roof flashing. The cost of repair will be about $450. Another problem is 
the dishwasher is worn out and will cost over $350 to replace. Do you think we 
should ask for our money back? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Quit complaining. No home is perfect, even brand-new ones. The defects 
you listed are insignificant. I'm sure you were disappointed, but consider 
yourself very fortunate that nothing major is wrong with the home you 
purchased. 
</P>
<P>
Check References of Cut-Rate Realty Agent 
</P>
<P>
Q: A local real estate broker advertises he will sell any home for a 4% sales 
commission, including listing it in the local multiple listing service and 
paying a 3% sales commission to the cooperating broker. As a former realty 
salesman, I don't see how this agent can do it. We are getting ready to sell 
our home. Do you think we should list with this agent? 
</P>
<P>
A: Before listing your home for sale with any real estate agent, ask for at 
least three names of their recent home sellers. Phone those people to ask, 
"Were you in any way unhappy with the agent's service and would you list your 
home for sale again with the same agent?" If you are still in doubt but you 
like the sales commission saving, try a 30-day listing with that cut-rate 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
Equity-Sharing Owner Must Be on Title 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I have about $75,000 total annual income but we only have 
around $5,500 in our savings account. We attended a lecture by a local realty 
agent who is trying to drum up sales by offering an equity-sharing plan. She 
says we can lease the house for three years and if we make all our payments on 
time, then we would go on the title. However, she was rather vague about our 
income tax deductions. Please clarify. 
</P>
<P>
A: Internal Revenue Code 280A says equity-sharing co-owners must all be on the 
title to qualify for the income tax deductions for mortgage interest and 
property taxes. In addition, the investor non-resident can depreciate his 
portion of the house. The realty agent's lease-option plan won't entitle you to 
any income tax deductions during the three years while you lease the house but 
are not on the title. 
</P>
<P>
Business in Home Is Tax-Deductible 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am considering starting a newsletter publishing business from my home. 
Recently I retired and I feel there is a need for a newsletter in my field. As 
I would be operating this business from my home, what tax considerations are 
involved in deducting my home office expenses? 
</P>
<P>
A: To qualify for tax deductions you must have an "exclusive business area." It 
can be part or all of a room. But it must be a special area that is not used 
for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
For example, suppose you use 500 square feet of your 2,000-square-foot home for 
your newsletter business. That means 25% of your home mortgage interest, 
property taxes, fire insurance, utilities and maintenance costs will become 
tax-deductible as business expenses. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, all directly applicable expenses, such as a business telephone 
line, are tax-deductible. Operating from your home is an excellent way to start 
your business. But be sure to document all your expenses because the IRS loves 
to audit home-operated businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Retirees Should Not Pay All Cash for Home 
</P>
<P>
Q: We recently sold our home for what I consider an obscene price. As a result, 
we are "flush with cash." Thanks to your expert advice, we used that $125,000 
"old folks" tax exemption. But we plan to buy a modest retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
Our question revolves around paying cash or getting a mortgage on the house we 
buy. My husband thinks we should pay all cash, but I think we should make a 
small down payment and keep the rest of our cash in CDs or other investments. 
What do you think? 
</P>
<P>
A: Insist that your husband follow your sound advice. Buying your retirement 
home for cash could be a very bad mistake, especially if you need cash for an 
emergency or investment opportunity. Although you are retired, that doesn't 
mean you shouldn't have a mortgage on your home. 
</P>
<P>
If you make the mistake of paying cash for your retirement home, in addition to 
sacrificing liquidity, you will be tying up your cash and making a very minimal 
yield on it. 
</P>
<P>
Even retirees should make a small cash down payments and obtain the maximum 
mortgage available. For example, I had to twist my elderly parents' arms to 
make a 10% down payment and obtain a 90% mortgage when they bought their condo 
several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
They thought it was outrageous to pay 9% interest. Since then, the $45,000 
profit on their $3,500 down payment is over 1,200% if my math is correct. I 
hope you get the point of making the smallest possible down payment when buying 
any residence, especially a retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
Can't Trade Stock for Home and Avoid Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently got married and want to buy my new wife a home. But the problem 
is we don't have much cash for a down payment. However, I do have some common 
stocks which I could trade for the down payment. But the problem is that I have 
about $25,000 profit in the stock. I've heard about tax-deferred real estate 
exchanges. How can I trade my stock as a down payment on a home without paying 
tax on the profit? 
</P>
<P>
A: Sorry, a profitable exchange of common stock for real estate would be a 
taxable event because it will be a trade of "unlike kind" property, namely 
personal property, for real property. 
</P>
<P>
A tax-deferred IRC 1031 exchange refers to a trade of one "like kind" property, 
such as an apartment building, for another such property without receiving any 
taxable unlike kind property such as cash or net mortgage relief. 
</P>
<P>
Sell Old Home Before Purchasing a New One 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are thinking of buying a larger home but have not yet found one we want 
to buy. But we are afraid to put our current residence on the market until we 
find one to buy. How can we best solve this "Catch-22" situation? 
</P>
<P>
A: If you are certain you want to buy another home, sell your old home first. 
Then you won't be under pressure to sell quickly and accept a less than ideal 
purchase offer. 
</P>
<P>
However, keep looking for a house to buy. If you find one you want to buy 
before you sell your present home, you can make a purchase offer with a 
contingency clause for the sale of your old home. But don't be surprised if the 
seller rejects your offer or insists it include a release clause so if a better 
offer comes along, the seller can insist you then either remove the contingency 
or cancel the purchase.

YOUR MORTGAGE;

<P>
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER YOU TURN IN YOUR LOAN APPLICATION; 
</P>
<P>
LENDING: IT'S A COMPLICATED SYSTEM, BUT SOME KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THINGS WORK CAN 
DEMYSTIFY THE PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Applying for a mortgage loan can be a harrowing experience: Consumers often 
face a mind-boggling array of complicated forms, technical jargon and legalese. 
But understanding how the lending system works can demystify the loan process, 
while a little preparation can help calm your nerves and speed the time it 
takes to get your money. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what happens to your completed application after you have given it to 
your lender depends on a variety of factors, including the institution's size, 
loan volume and organizational structure. 
</P>
<P>
By and large, the days when your completed application was looked over by a 
loan committee are virtually gone, unless you're using a relatively small 
savings and loan association. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, your completed loan packet will probably be sent to an off-site 
loan-processing center operated by the lender. A clerk there "looks at your 
application and punches a bunch of information into a computer, including the 
address of the property, the loan amount and the interest rate," said Palma 
Jarvis, a vice president with San Diego-based Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Your application is also assigned a file number. 
</P>
<P>
After all this information is recorded, Jarvis said, the computer generates a 
federally mandated disclosure form. Among other items, the form provides an 
approximate estimate of the fees you'll pay to obtain the loan, your monthly 
payments and the annual percentage rate on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure form is mailed to the borrower. Meanwhile, the application is 
passed to a loan processor or, in some cases, directly to a loan underwriter. 
</P>
<P>
Being a processor or underwriter isn't the world's most glamorous job, but the 
thousands of men and women who do it for a living are cornerstones of the home 
loan business. 
</P>
<P>
The processor reviews your application to make sure everything is in order. 
Then he or she sends out a variety of documents to about a dozen different 
parties, including forms to establish how much you earn from your employer and 
how much money you have in savings and checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
The processor also orders a credit report and sends a form to the lender who 
holds the seller's mortgage to find out how much the seller owes on the 
property, Jarvis said. 
</P>
<P>
Once all these documents have been returned, they're typically combined with 
your loan application and forwarded to the lender's loan underwriter. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, the underwriter is like a one-person loan committee: He reviews all 
the documents, double-checks the credit report, analyzes the borrower's income 
and debts and performs a variety of other tasks. 
</P>
<P>
If the underwriter approves the loan amount, the loan documents are filled out 
and sent to your escrow agent or closing attorney. The agent calls you in to 
sign the papers and collects your check for the down payment. 
</P>
<P>
Once all the paper work has been signed, the escrow agent sends them to yet 
another bank employee -- a "closer" or "funder." The closer issues a check to 
the escrow company for the amount of your loan, less your various loan-related 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The escrow company then sends checks to several parties. The lender who 
originally financed the property gets one check and the seller usually gets 
another. Checks might also be sent to a variety of other parties, including 
termite-repair companies and realtors involved in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The following morning, a trust deed proving your ownership of the property and 
the lender's lien on the home are recorded at the county recorder's office. 
</P>
<P>
With all the people and paper work involved in the home-loan process, don't be 
surprised if snags develop along the way. Here are some tips that can help you 
keep delays to a minimum: 
</P>
<P>
* Get prequalified before you actually apply for a loan or, even better, before 
you start looking for a house. It'll help you avoid looking at homes that you 
can't afford and also help you get your financial house in order -- an 
important first step in the home loan process. 
</P>
<P>
* Request a copy of your credit report now. You can find credit reporting 
agencies in the Yellow Pages of the phone book and order a report for about 
$25. If the report turns up any problems, try to get them straightened out 
before they have a chance to cause delays in processing your loan application. 
</P>
<P>
* Make sure you have all your tax and financial records handy. This includes 
the last two or three years of tax returns as well as W-2 forms, recent pay 
stubs and bank and credit card statements. 
</P>
<P>
* Get your mortgage broker or loan representative to help you fill out all the 
paper work. If you try to do it yourself, there's a chance that you'll either 
misunderstand the forms or fill them out incorrectly -- either of which can 
delay the processing of your loan. 
</P>
<P>
* Alert your employer, banker and others that you have applied for a loan. Ask 
them to promptly complete and return any forms that the mortgage company sends 
to them to verify your earnings, savings or debt. 
</P>
<P>
* Reply quickly to any requests for additional information from the lender. 
Also consider hand-delivering documents to the loan representative, escrow 
agent and others instead of handling it all through the mail.

REPORT PREDICTS WORLDWIDE WATER SHORTAGES IN 1990S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A collision between increasing populations and wasteful irrigation practices 
will produce shortages of water and food in some of the world's most populous 
countries during the 1990s, the Worldwatch Institute warned in a report 
released Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the situation in the United States is less dire, the inexorable growth 
of Western states and their increasing demands on limited water resources will 
force more of the nation's richest croplands out of production, the institute 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest and most dramatic impact of worldwide pressure on water supplies 
may be felt in Egypt, according to the institute, a nonprofit research 
organization that studies world environmental and economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
It noted that virtually all productive land in Egypt is irrigated, the 
population is growing at a rate of a million people every eight months, and the 
country is the last in line to draw water from the Nile River. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook for China, India, Mexico, Israel and Jordan is somewhat less stark, 
but nevertheless foreboding, the institute reported. 
</P>
<P>
At least 10 countries in North and East Africa "are likely to experience severe 
water stress by 2000," the report states. "Egypt, already near its limits, 
could lose vital supplies from the Nile as upper basin countries develop the 
river's headwaters." 
</P>
<P>
In much of the Third World, food security is destined to replace military 
security as the most pressing priority of many nations, Worldwatch Director 
Lester R. Brown said at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
The institute's study was headed by Sandra Postel, a Worldwatch vice president 
and senior researcher who attributed looming shortages to short-sighted 
policies, technical obsolescence and rising costs, in addition to the pressure 
of growing populations. 
</P>
<P>
In China, Postel said, the water tables beneath Beijing are dropping as much as 
2 meters per year, and farmers in the arid region of the country may lose 30% 
to 40% of their irrigation water to critical municipal and industrial demands. 
</P>
<P>
In India, thousands of villages already face shortages, and large sections of 
metropolitan New Delhi have water for only a few hours a day, while around 
Mexico City, land is subsiding because of ground-water depletion. 
</P>
<P>
In Israel, Jordan and the West Bank, where streams, aquifers and all other 
water supplies that are renewed by rainfall will be in use by 1995, "shortages 
are imminent," Postel said. 
</P>
<P>
On a per-capita basis, the amount of irrigated land has been declining 
worldwide since 1978, and in some countries, such as Mexico, there have been 
outright reductions in the total area under irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
Although many countries, such as China and India, rely on irrigation for more 
than half of their food production, lending for irrigation by the major 
international donors has declined sharply over the last decade, Worldwatch 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Lending to 23 countries in Asia, North Africa and the Middle East by the World 
Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the U.S. Agency for International Development 
and the Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund fell more than 60% after 
adjusting for inflation between 1977 and 1987, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of bringing new land under irrigation is soaring -- reaching as much 
as $4,000 per acre in Mexico -- and more than half of the world's irrigation 
systems are in need of upgrading to remain in good working order, the group 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the United States will not experience the potential catastrophe facing 
much of the Third World, the report found trends in the United States moving in 
the same direction and policies hardly more efficient than those where critical 
shortages loom. 
</P>
<P>
Rapidly expanding Western cities, facing future water deficits, are 
increasingly buying up perpetual water rights in a practice known as "water 
ranching." In Pima County, Ariz., around Tucson, irrigated agriculture is 
expected to disappear by the year 2020, the institute reported. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 4 million hectares -- about 10 million acres -- of U.S. 
agricultural land is being irrigated at unsustainable rates "and will 
eventually come out of irrigated production" unless farmers reduce pumping to 
no more than the rate at which rainfall recharges aquifers, Postel said. 
</P>
<P>
Water subsidies by the Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation have 
subsidized farmers who grow hay and pasture while more valuable water 
priorities go wanting. And the artificially low cost of water used to irrigate 
croplands such as California's San Joaquin Valley causes inefficient use of 
scarce water resources. 
</P>
<P>
"Farmers benefiting from the huge Central Valley Project in California have 
repaid only 5% of the project's costs over the last 40 years -- $50 million out 
of $931 million," Postel said. "This free ride in large part explains why so 
few Western farmers invest in efficiency improvements." 
</P>
<P>
The institute report was completed before the Interior Department's decision 
Nov. 29 to renew 28 Central Valley water contracts for another 40 years. The 
contracts provide for a 300% increase in the price paid by valley farmers for 
irrigation water while ensuring that they will continue to receive ample 
supplies well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
The 28 contract renewals were regarded as a harbinger of Bush Administration 
policy on hundreds of contracts due to expire over the next several years. 
Although some contract terms could be modified in response to findings of an 
environmental impact statement, the amount of water allocated to agricultural 
interests will not be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Among significant water policy initiatives around the world, Postel cited the 
conservation initiatives of Southern California's Metropolitan Water District 
as an example worthy of wide emulation. 
</P>
<P>
By financing conservation projects in the Imperial Irrigation District, the 
Metropolitan Water District is getting enough water for 800,000 Southern 
Californians without the need for taking cropland out of production or selling 
irrigation water rights. 
</P>
<P>
Postel said that approach is "at the other extreme" from the strategy in 
Arizona, where water ranching by cities has already destined thousands of acres 
of prime agricultural land to revert to desert.

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three weeks after it was born, this nation's opposition of students and 
political amateurs on Saturday won its revolution. The victory was sweeping: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In a new government to be formally announced today, the opposition will 
hold several key posts, including two deputy premierships and the portfolios of 
foreign affairs and economic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- While the prime ministership remains in Communist hands, the new government 
pushed the Communist Party into a minority role. Communists will have 10 seats 
in a 21-member Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The opposition also won the resignation of the country's president, Gustav 
Husak, the sole remaining senior Communist figure linked with the 1968 
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Husak, 76, announced his resignation in a nationally televised address just two 
hours before the new government was formed. 
</P>
<P>
He is expected to step down today after the planned swearing-in ceremony for 
the government in the 1,000-year-old Prague Castle. 
</P>
<P>
Husak's departure fulfilled one of the final demands of the opposition umbrella 
group Civic Forum, which from its inception Nov. 20 had called for the 
resignation of those installed in power by the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, speculation mounted that Husak could be replaced by the opposition's 
leading figure, Vaclav Havel, an idea that would have been considered absurd 
three weeks ago and highly improbable as recently as last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
At a hastily arranged news conference, the new prime minister-designate, Marian 
Calfa, declared that two days of talks had succeeded in creating what he called 
"a government of national understanding." 
</P>
<P>
The main task of the new interim government is to pave the way for the 
country's first genuinely free national elections in 43 years. Elections should 
be held "at the latest in June," according to Jan Carnogursky, a former 
dissident who will now be a senior government minister. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed a day of hectic negotiations and mounting 
anticipation. Calfa's appearance before the television cameras was repeatedly 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
"I can proclaim the result of these talks is agreement on a government for 
Czechoslovakia," Calfa said. "I emphasize full agreement." 
</P>
<P>
He described the negotiations as "very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by two aides, Calfa sat at the head of a large square table, noticeably 
distant from the Communist Party's negotiator at the talks, Politburo member 
Vasil Mohorita. Mohorita, seated at the far end of the conference table, was 
seen on state television being overwhelmed by cameramen leaning over him to 
take pictures of Calfa and Havel. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, dressed in a rare suit and tie, agreed with Calfa, both on the 
difficulty of the talks and his description of the government as one of 
national understanding. 
</P>
<P>
"We have arrived at a result which is satisfactory to Civic Forum and the 
Public Against Violence," Havel said. "It is the maximum which could be 
accomplished in the given situation and speed." 
</P>
<P>
The Public Against Violence is an opposition umbrella group in the country's 
eastern constituent republic of Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, students of the University of Coimbra in Portugal delivered 
thousands of roses to students here in a gesture of solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
At Civic Forum headquarters, there were hugs, tears and laughter as members 
celebrated their victory into the early hours of this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the composition (of the government) provides guarantees that 
conditions in the country cannot go back to the situation prior to November 17. 
This means that the inauguration of total democracy in Czechoslovakia can 
continue," Carnogursky said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a vicious police attack on a peaceful student demonstration in Prague on 
Nov. 17 that sparked the revolution that brought down the hard-line Communist 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
Carnogursky, 45, who was in jail until two weeks ago, is expected to hold the 
most senior opposition job as deputy premier with responsibility for legal and 
interior matters. 
</P>
<P>
The position would give him responsibility over those who guarded him while he 
was in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Control over the Interior Ministry was the biggest sticking point in the talks, 
according to one of those present. The solution, the source said, was to place 
the ministry's police and security functions under a troika of Cabinet 
ministers, including Calfa and Carnogursky. The third member of the troika is 
expected to be a minister with ties to the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
With its secret police, the Interior Ministry was a key instrument of Communist 
Party intimidation and repression. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Valtr Komarek, head of the country's controversial Institute of 
(Economic) Forecasting and a well-known critic of Communist central planning, 
will be named a deputy prime minister placed in overall charge of economic 
affairs, according to an opposition participant in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
This source said that two other members of the same institute will also be in 
the Cabinet, including Vaclav Klaus, a man who has described himself as the 
Milton Friedman of Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Chicago's Friedman is a strict free-market economist. 
</P>
<P>
Although nominally a Communist Party member, Komarek recently said at a news 
conference that communism is "nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
The Communists also gave up control of foreign affairs, ceding the foreign 
minister's post to a senior opposition figure and Civic Forum's main spokesman, 
Jiri Dienstbier, a journalist by profession. 
</P>
<P>
The critical Defense Ministry portfolio was apparently decided last Thursday at 
a meeting between Havel and Communist Defense Minister Miroslav Vacek, an army 
general. 
</P>
<P>
According to an opposition source with knowledge of the meeting, Havel told 
Vacek that Civic Forum had no objection to his remaining in that post. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Civic Forum had demanded a civilian defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
The evening of political drama began with Husak's appearance on national 
television, shortly after the main evening news. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the government is appointed, I will resign from the post of 
president to permit the easing of the situation and future development," he 
said. "The National Assembly will elect a new president within two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Husak, who seemed tense and edgy during his brief speech, apologized in advance 
for the unstructured nature of his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are developing so fast, I didn't have time to write the few lines I 
wanted to say to you today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The breathtaking pace of Czechoslovakia's political transformation from 
Communist repression to the brink of democracy has given few the luxury of 
preparation. 
</P>
<P>
Husak spoke of the debate that has been ignited here about the Soviet-led 
invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact forces that crushed the so-called 
Prague Spring reforms of 1968. He admitted that mistakes had been made and 
cited Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev as the leader in the renewel of 
socialism. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally, from early years, believed in the shining ideas of socialism," 
Husak said. "I can't see anything better. There were mistakes in the ways it 
was carried out, but not in the ideas. I don't see in the world today better 
fundamental ideas." 
</P>
<P>
The controversial Husak, who has held the largely ceremonial presidency since 
1975, concluded: "I hope we can overcome the crisis as soon as possible so we 
can go forward with our effort." 
</P>
<P>
Husak's resignation was part of a package negotiated between the Communists and 
the opposition.

A VILLAGE'S SOBERING REVERSAL;

FOR DECADES, EVERY ADULT IN THE INDIAN TOWN OF ALKALI LAKE WAS ALCOHOLIC. SOBER

ALKALI LAKE, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If there was ever a showcase of teetotaling, it is this Indian village of 486, 
set in the piney hills of south-central British Columbia. If there was ever a 
lesson to be learned about the ancient, everlasting snares and delusions of 
strong waters, the fathers and mothers, sons and daughters of Alkali Lake are 
the ones to teach it. 
</P>
<P>
The Shuswap Indians of Alkali Lake came by their abstinence the hard way: 
Throughout the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, the alcoholism rate here was 100%, 
and when recovery did come, it involved a sort of house-to-house combat with 
booze. 
</P>
<P>
"It was continuous drinking," said Francis Johnson, a 40-year-old recovering 
alcoholic who now teaches fourth through seventh grade at the village school. 
"Because of the drinking, there was a lot of child neglect, wife abuse, rape, 
gang rape -- the worst kind of things you can imagine." 
</P>
<P>
Even the children drank in those days, he said. So did the parish priest. 
Contemptuous outsiders dubbed the place "Alcohol Lake." 
</P>
<P>
Then, through the herculean efforts of a lone married couple, virtually every 
adult in Alkali Lake sobered up. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the townspeople entertain themselves with strictly alcohol-free dances 
and bingo games, and at the recent wedding of one of Johnson's sisters, he 
said, the bride and groom served an innocent fruit punch. 
</P>
<P>
Maggie Hodgson, an Indian addiction expert who has worked with some of the 
Alkali Lakers, celebrates the "hyper-vigilance" today of the village, which, 
like many Canadian Indian settlements, is largely composed of several extended 
families. 
</P>
<P>
One-time leaders and elders of the town are under investigation for their 
drunken crimes of the past. Indeed, addiction counseling has become something 
of a growth industry -- the only one in town. 
</P>
<P>
The Alkali Lake story shows what can be done through the right mix of 
neighborly concern and brute determination, especially on an Indian reserve -- 
as Canadian reservations are called -- where fatalism toward the wages of drink 
runs high. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not a story with a happy ending -- for the people of Alkali Lake are 
now finding that no matter how dramatic their generation's success in fighting 
the bottle may be, it is still no guarantee against the addiction of the next 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
And if the town's experience shows that alcoholism can be conquered en masse, 
it also shows that the long-term effects of drinking can outlast even the 
drinkers themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Our age was drunk and we sobered up, but now our children are drinking," said 
Mabel Paul, a 39-year-old woman with a welcoming smile and sad eyes who pauses 
to explain the situation while mopping melted snow from the schoolroom floor. 
"My oldest is 19 -- now he's the one who's starting to drink." 
</P>
<P>
To appreciate the anguish a surge of teen-age drinking has brought to this town 
of recovering alcoholics, one has to consider the depths to which Alkali Lake 
had sunk two decades ago. Nearly every adult in town talks explicitly of those 
days, as if trying to draw warnings from them. 
</P>
<P>
There is the witness of Josephine Johnson, for one, a trapper's daughter born 
in 1935. She does not remember people drinking so much when she was small, she 
said. Indians were forbidden by law to patronize bars and liquor stores then, 
and today's welfare system had not yet been set up. Johnson remembers her 
father leading a difficult, but dry, life, trading pelts in the winter and 
hiring on as a ranch hand or fruit picker when the spring thaw came. 
</P>
<P>
It was the white fur traders, she said, who introduced beer and liquor, 
offering drink to the Indians in exchange for pelts. 
</P>
<P>
"Then (my father) started coming home with a bottle," she said. "Violence 
started. I remember my mother getting slapped around." 
</P>
<P>
She watched in horror and promised herself that she'd never drink, she said. 
But in 1951, Indians won the right to drink in bars, and in 1962 they were 
allowed to buy carry-outs. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when thing started getting bad," she said. "That's the time when I 
started drinking. I went on for days and days. Twice I landed in the hospital 
for too much alcohol. Whenever I got hungry, I wouldn't eat -- I just had a 
drink." 
</P>
<P>
A freight service, the Dog Creek Stage, started up, taking liquor orders from 
the Alkali Lakers and hauling in the booze over the gravel road from Williams 
Lake, the nearest large town. 
</P>
<P>
When the money was bad and she couldn't afford the stage, Josephine Johnson 
said, she would scavenge old jars and bottle caps and put up her own homemade 
beer. And when she couldn't find enough bottles, she added, she would guzzle 
straight from the brew pot. 
</P>
<P>
She chuckled as she told of her alcoholic husband's car crash: His injuries 
were grave, she said, and the insurance company sent the couple a check for 
$17,000 to cover his claim. She and her husband paid the hospital bills -- and 
then giddily drank through the rest of the windfall. 
</P>
<P>
One day Josephine Johnson came home from an all-night toot in a neighboring 
town to find that a court had taken away her children and sent them to a foster 
home. Her response was not grief or outrage, but pure abandon. 
</P>
<P>
"I had it made then," she said. "I had no responsibilities. And then I really 
went at it." 
</P>
<P>
Up and down the rutted dirt streets of Alkali Lake, in and out of its one-story 
houses and icicle-strung log cabins, the facts repeated themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Johnson, now principal of the village school, said he used to drink so 
much that he "just felt like a hunk of bacon walking around." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people my age died," he said. "Crashes. People froze, and people 
drowned. House fires." He said he once beat up his father -- also an alcoholic 
-- so badly that he almost killed him. He himself is still missing his front 
teeth from a beery car wreck years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Francis Johnson, meanwhile, wrote a thesis about Alkali Lake after he sobered 
up and went to graduate school. He told of his father's beating his mother to 
death, and the rage he felt. 
</P>
<P>
"I attempted suicide on several occasions," he wrote, telling of efforts to 
drown himself in rivers and a bathtub and of trying to strangle himself with a 
rope. "I went to the mountain with a .22-caliber rifle. As soon as the sun came 
up I was going to shoot myself, but I didn't have the courage to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Such tales and inventories are typical not only of Alkali Lake, but of Indian 
reserves and reservations across North America. 
</P>
<P>
"No group in America, or possibly the world, has been stigmatized more by 
alcohol-related behavior than American Indians," said Philip A. May, a 
University of New Mexico sociologist who for six years ran the U.S. Indian 
Health Service's programs on the children of alcoholic mothers. 
</P>
<P>
May points out that alcohol abuse varies widely from tribe to tribe and that 
some tribes drink less than the national average. But on the whole, studies 
show, Indians in North America begin drinking younger than other ethnic groups, 
drink more often and in greater volume, and suffer far worse effects. 
</P>
<P>
Under severe peer pressure, they often adopt a flamboyant "drinking style" of 
going on binges in groups. "Binge drinking," May has written, "is perceived as 
the unique 'Indian' style and is the most easily observed, exotic and curious" 
-- not to mention the most dangerous, as statistics attest. 
</P>
<P>
Studies show that Indians have higher rates of alcohol-related arrest and 
hospitalization, or blackouts, suicide and homicide. More than three times as 
many Indian men die of cirrhosis of the liver and other alcohol-linked 
disorders than do white men -- 34.7 Indians per 100,000 deaths, as opposed to 
9.8 whites. 
</P>
<P>
Why this should be has been the subject of extensive research, much of it 
seeking some physiological difference between Indians and whites. No credible 
study has ever been able to find one, May said, adding that he thinks the 
reasons lie in social, cultural or psychological factors. 
</P>
<P>
Alkali Lake's turnaround started in 1972 with Phyllis Chelsea, now 46, a mother 
of three and recovered binge drinker who currently runs a counseling center on 
the main street of the village. Her husband, Andy, also was an alcoholic. He 
said he was hospitalized four or five times for kidney trouble before he 
finally sobered up, and twice he beat Phyllis so badly that she required 
hospital treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The violence terrified the couple's children. One day the Chelseas dropped the 
kids off at their grandmother's house and went off on a drunk. When they 
returned, days later, their eldest daughter, Ivy, then 7, refused to go home 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
It was a watershed moment for Phyllis Chelsea. 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up having a lot of feelings about my parents' drinking," she said. "I 
didn't want to have anything to do with them." Now, here was her own daughter, 
refusing to have anything to do with her. Phyllis Chelsea quit drinking on the 
spot, and in the years since she has pulled almost every adult in town up onto 
the wagon with her. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband came first. Andy Chelsea, 47, said he continued drinking for about 
a week after his wife stopped but became more and more disgusted with what was 
happening in his village. The chief had put him on an education committee, and 
he took to visiting the tiny local school. Children would show up black and 
blue in the morning, he said, with ragged clothes and rumbling stomachs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so pitiful," he recalled. "You'd never see them smile. You'd never see 
them have fun. They were just dragging themselves to school." Steeled by his 
wife's example, he, too, stopped drinking for the sake of the children. 
</P>
<P>
May, the sociologist, is not surprised. He has been giving speeches on the 
perils of heavy drinking for 20 years, and the only thing that "makes people 
catch fire," he said, has been the recent understanding of alcohol's lingering 
effects on alcoholics' children. May used to try to prod people toward sobriety 
with talks on car crashes and suicide, he said, and they would merely say, 
"Ho-hum, we've heard that before, and it's an insurmountable problem." 
</P>
<P>
The first year was lonely for the Chelseas: Friends would burst into their home 
and taunt them with open cans and bottles. They tried to hold a dry New Year's 
Eve party; the only people to come were village children, happy to eat a hot 
meal -- and one woman who announced that she, too, was going to go sober. 
</P>
<P>
Then the village chief decided to step down and appointed Andy Chelsea to take 
his place. Stone sober, and suddenly vested with vast powers, Chelsea decided 
to dry out the town. 
</P>
<P>
First, he told the whiskey priest to leave. Next, he gathered evidence on who 
was moonshining and got the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to run some busts. 
The first person arrested, it turned out, was Chelsea's own mother. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Chelsea banned the Dog Creek Stage from Alkali Lake, cutting off yet 
another source of beer, wine and spirits. And finally, he started holding the 
villagers' welfare checks each month and issuing vouchers instead. The vouchers 
could be used to buy food and clothing -- but not booze -- at nearby stores. 
Chelsea kept the books and reimbursed the merchants at the end of the month. 
The shopkeepers were cooperative, but hard-drinking villagers nearly mounted a 
rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
The Chelseas said they had to lock up their children at night because of death 
threats. And Francis Johnson said that one night, a would-be assassin burst 
into his house and announced that he was going to kill the new chief. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a rifle, a .30-.30," Johnson recalled. "He just talked, and I just 
listened, and when he finished I asked him for the shells. He was reluctant, 
but finally he gave them to me. I didn't ask him for the gun, because I didn't 
know if it was loaded and I didn't want to wrestle him for it." 
</P>
<P>
At length, the man left, he said, and "I didn't hear a shot, so I know he 
didn't shoot the chief." 
</P>
<P>
The death threats and harassment continued through Chelsea's first term as 
chief, the couple said -- and then he had to stand for reelection. To the 
couple's astonishment, it was the same hard-drinking people who had cursed 
Chelsea the most who now argued that he had to continue in office. The Chelseas 
had been persuading them, one by one, not to drink. 
</P>
<P>
Mabel Paul, who was the third villager to sober up, said the Chelseas nurtured 
her through her first tough, dry Christmas by bringing her presents. She said 
she was amazed because it had never occurred to her that Christmas could mean 
something besides paralytic drunkenness. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Dick, who worked for the village administration as a builder, was told 
that he would lose his job if he didn't go for dry-out treatment. He went, and 
says now that he has not had a drink in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage the growing number of recovering alcoholics, the Chelseas found 
baby-sitters to look after their children while they were away for the cure and 
hired carpenters to spruce up their homes for their return. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Chelsea found an Indian spiritual elder off the reserve and brought him 
to Alkali Lake to instruct the townspeople in their ancestral traditions. He 
taught them the proper use of some old, neglected huts down by the creek: They 
were ceremonial "sweat lodges," he said, which work like saunas and figure in 
Shuswap purification rites. Villagers have since built a dozen new sweat lodges 
and use them every day. 
</P>
<P>
By 1986, villagers agreed, 95% of the adults in Alkali Lake were sober. Some 
traveled to other Indian reserves to tell their story, and now at least three 
additional settlements have begun to turn dry. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Chelsea, still the chief, has turned from social problems to the village's 
chronic economic grief. He attracted government backing for various development 
projects: a small hog farm, a village greenhouse, a logging co-op. None of the 
projects has prospered, however, and Alkali Lakers' dreams of establishing an 
alcohol-treatment center have been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't own the land we sit on, so whatever we do has to be approved by the 
federal government," Chelsea said. He added that the young villagers who had 
trained for jobs in the development schemes were left without hope when the 
projects folded. 
</P>
<P>
And now the young people -- the same ones who as children had weighed so 
heavily on the collective parental conscience -- have begun drinking. And not 
only are they drinking, but drinking in the same deadly "styles" that put 
Indians across Canada and the United States at high risk. Mabel Paul said 
friends recently called her one night to warn her that her 19-year-old son was 
lying unconscious in the snow. 
</P>
<P>
Alkali Lake recreation director Alfred Harry, 25, said his best friend hanged 
himself two years ago. "He knew he was an alcoholic, and he couldn't have 
stopped that," said Harry, an adamant non-drinker who considers himself an 
alcoholic simply because his mother drank while pregnant with him. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Dick, the home builder, said his younger brother died last month when he 
blacked out and vomited while lying on his back. He holds out a snapshot of the 
young man just days before his death, clean-cut in a baseball cap, proudly 
holding a pair of mounted antlers. 
</P>
<P>
"He had just graduated (from high school) last June," Dick said. "He had two 
scholarships. This is the kind of thing I don't understand -- what are the kids 
going through that we don't know about?" 
</P>
<P>
Studies show that the children of alcoholics are from 4 to 8 times more likely 
than the North American population as a whole to become alcoholics. What the 
researchers don't know -- and may never know -- is whether the tendency is 
hereditary or behavioral, although there is strong evidence for some of both. 
</P>
<P>
Maggie Hodgson, executive director of the Nechi Institute, a training and 
research institute for Indian addiction counselors in Edmonton, Alberta, thinks 
it has everything to do with the pain children harbor for years after watching 
their parents and other relatives beat up each other. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Indian community, our greatest strength can be our extended system," 
she said, noting that it helps alcoholics support each other through the 
D.T.'s. "But I wonder if our greatest strength can also be our greatest 
weakness. Because we live so closely in our extended-family situation, we're 
very affected by those relatives' drinking." 
</P>
<P>
Wilfred Johnson, the son of a man who drank himself to death, took a break from 
sweeping up the snow with a "shovel" made of a signboard tacked to a pole and 
tried to explain the situation: 
</P>
<P>
"Even the kids around here who have got a Grade 12 (diploma) and stuff -- 
they're still not working. They've got no communication with their parents, and 
they feel so lost they just don't know which way to go. They get so they just 
say, 'The heck with it,' and go and hang themselves." 
</P>
<P>
He put down his scoop and offered to give a visitor a tour of one of the 
ceremonial sweat lodges. He is proud of the lodge, neatly carpeted with cedar 
boughs, and he noted that in Shuswap tradition, it represents a mother's womb. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to drink, and I got pretty close to killing myself with a knife," he 
said. "I'm on my second year sober now. I feel like I'm trapped between two 
worlds."

REPORT HITS UNIVERSITY EXPANSION; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: COMMISSION STRONGLY CRITICIZES CAMPUS CONSTRUCTION PLANS OF UC AND 
CAL STATE SYSTEMS, SAYING THEY ARE BASED ON OVERLY OPTIMISTIC ENROLLMENT 
PROJECTIONS.

<P>
A new study strongly criticizes $2-billion worth of expansion proposals from 
California's two university systems, saying that only two of as many as nine 
new campuses being sought seem necessary. The report, however, does support 
possible construction of as many as 22 additional two-year community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Prepared by staff members of the California Postsecondary Education Commission 
(CPEC), the report asserts that University of California and the California 
State University growth plans are based on unreasonably high enrollment 
projections for minority and graduate students. 
</P>
<P>
It says that the UC system should build only one additional campus, not as many 
as the three proposed, and that the Cal State system should proceed with its 
new San Marcos campus but halt plans for five others. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the pressure on UC's undergraduate growth can be handled by more than 
tripling the size of UC Riverside and by encouraging more students to attend 
independent institutions with larger state-financed scholarships, CPEC staff 
members suggested. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they described as "worthy" but unrealistic UC's desire to sharply 
increase the number of graduate students so that all nine of its current 
campuses become "world-renowned research institutions." 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State system is criticized in the report for assuming that Latinos and 
blacks will vastly improve their now low college attendance rate over the next 
15 years to match that of Anglos. 
</P>
<P>
"This expectation is obviously a laudable policy goal . . . yet it may not be 
reasonable for capital outlay planning," the CPEC study says. The Cal State 
system projects that within 15 years it will have 466,000 students, about 
190,000 more than now but 105,400 more than CPEC estimates. 
</P>
<P>
If the educational achievements of Latinos and blacks do improve dramatically, 
the trend will first be noticed in junior high and high schools, allowing time 
to plan new Cal State schools, CPEC analyst Kirk Knutsen said at an advance 
press briefing Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Why make irreversible decisions now when you don't have to?" he asked. 
Meanwhile, Knutsen added, expanding the existing Cal State campuses and 
building one at San Marcos will suffice. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, adding as many as 22 community colleges to the existing 107 
two-year schools appears reasonable to accommodate an expected increase in 
students from 1.33 million to 1.8 million, according to the CPEC staff. Such 
construction would cost about $2.3 billion, and much study is needed on site 
selection and financing, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
The 48-page document, entitled "Higher Education at the Crossroads: Planning 
for the 21st Century," was written in the shadow of tough financial realities. 
It presumes that the state faces enormous problems paying for anything more 
than modest expansions in higher education, even if voters approve the proposed 
constitutional amendment to adjust the so-called Gann spending limit. 
</P>
<P>
The draft report will be formally presented tomorrow to the commission, which 
advises the Legislature on higher education matters. The commission is expected 
to vote on a final version next month. CPEC staffers said they do not expect 
much change over the month, even though officials from both UC and Cal State 
disagree with parts of the report. 
</P>
<P>
John Smart, Cal State's vice chancellor for university affairs, said he was 
"rather perplexed" by the study's seeming pessimism on projected increases in 
Latino and black enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
"We disagree that we are being over-optimistic. We think it's a goal that is 
quite attainable," Smart said in a telephone interview, adding that he thought 
that CPEC was using outdated statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State San Marcos is now under construction in northern San Diego County and 
is expected to be finished in about two years. It will be the 20th campus in 
the Cal State system. 
</P>
<P>
The CPEC report urges Cal State administrators to cease buying other properties 
after they acquire land in Ventura County for a satellite education center. 
However, Smart said it would be economically foolish to postpone buying other 
land. 
</P>
<P>
UC is not challenging the report's contention that only one more UC campus is 
needed, acknowledging that the system's leaders have not committed themselves 
to the three they claim may be needed to accommodate enrollment growth. UC is 
now studying possible sites for one additional campus. 
</P>
<P>
However, UC will argue that the report errs in saying that large expansions in 
graduate programs are unrealistic, UC spokesman Ronald Kolb said in a telephone 
interview. In addition, UC President David P. Gardner believes that the 
Riverside campus should grow in 15 years from its current 6,000 students to 
about 12,000, not to the 20,000 recommended by the CPEC report. 
</P>
<P>
"Growth of that magnitude in that short a period of time would negatively 
impact on program quality and quality of life on campus," Kolb said. 
</P>
<P>
CPEC's executive director Kenneth B. O'Brien said that his staff's report 
focuses on UC Riverside expansion because of political resistance to much 
campus growth in other UC communities such as Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz and 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
The report urges that state grants for students at independent colleges be 
hiked from the current maximum of $5,250 a year to the $6,500 allowable by law 
now. The CPEC staff thinks that such a change would shift about 6,000 students 
who might otherwise attend UC for its relatively low cost to such independent 
schools as USC, the University of Redlands or Loyola Marymount University. 
Excluding room and board, tuition and fees at, for example, USC total $13,446 
this year, compared to about $1,700 at a UC campus.

PARKER, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten weeks ago, Grace O'Campo gave her daughter a kiss and a squeeze and sent 
the girl off for a five-day visit with her paternal grandparents, Navajo 
Indians who live on the reservation that surrounds this sleepy Colorado River 
town. 
</P>
<P>
The shy first-grader hasn't been home since. 
</P>
<P>
When O'Campo telephoned near the end of daughter Earlene's stay, she learned 
that the 6-year-old had been taken in by her Navajo father, Larry Lee, whom 
O'Campo left in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
This is crazy, the shaken mother protested from her home in Salinas, Calif. Why 
are you doing this? Send my daughter back. 
</P>
<P>
The reply from Parker: Earlene will not be returning. She belongs here, on the 
reservation. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks since, O'Campo, 32, has waged a frantic fight to get her daughter 
back. She has called the local police. She has approached the FBI. She has even 
begged Arizona's governor for help. 
</P>
<P>
But Lee, 29, was one step ahead of her. He had hired a lawyer and won temporary 
custody of the girl from the local tribal court. Lee, who is not talking 
publicly about the case, also has petitioned for permanent custody, charging in 
court papers that O'Campo is unfit to raise the child. 
</P>
<P>
In what seemed a dizzying instant, Earlene's fate had become a matter to be 
decided on the reservation. It was too late, authorities told her mother, for 
outsiders to interfere. 
</P>
<P>
O'Campo grew desperate and, the day before Thanksgiving, resolved to abduct her 
child and head back to California. The pair made it to a bus stop 40 miles 
upriver, but their journey ended there. Tribal police caught up with them and 
reclaimed Earlene as her sobbing mother looked on. 
</P>
<P>
Distraught and too poor to hire an attorney, O'Campo fears that the worst 
awaits her later this month, when a tribal judge decides which parent will take 
Earlene home. 
</P>
<P>
She may have reason to worry, some legal experts say. The historic exodus of 
Indian children from their families and culture, mostly through adoptions by 
white couples, has made tribal courts acutely sensitive to requests by American 
Indian parents to keep youngsters on the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how good a mother I am, I don't think I have a chance," O'Campo said 
in an interview last week. "I sit here and think, 'Oh, God, maybe someone will 
hear me, maybe someone can help me.' 
</P>
<P>
"Because if I don't get help, I'm going to lose her. I'm going to walk into 
that court and lose her." 
</P>
<P>
Divorced and raising a son, she was a Tupperware saleswoman marking time in 
Parker, her hometown. Fresh out of the Marine Corps, he was a brawny man who 
had a friendly way with her boy. He wooed her with roses, picnics at the river 
and trips to the movies. They fell in love. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't last long. Six months after giving birth to Earlene Monica on a hot 
August day in 1983, Grace O'Campo left Larry Lee. She moved with the children 
to Salinas, where a sister lived. 
</P>
<P>
The parting was a hostile one, O'Campo said, and afterward Lee showed little 
interest in their daughter. O'Campo, who collected welfare while working part 
time for the Salinas Police Department and attending college, was unable to 
obtain child-support payments from Lee, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her bitterness, O'Campo's anger did not extend to Lee's parents, who 
own an upholstery shop in Parker. Mary and Leo Lee telephoned their pigtailed 
granddaughter almost every week, and Earlene sometimes spent holidays visiting 
the doting couple. 
</P>
<P>
So it was with few qualms, O'Campo said, that she packed the child off for a 
week's stay with the grandparents in September, when O'Campo was scheduled to 
undergo minor surgery. 
</P>
<P>
She soon regretted her decision. When O'Campo telephoned to ask that Earlene be 
brought home, she was told that the girl was now living with Larry and his 
wife, Sandy, and their four children on the Colorado River Indian Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe this was happening, that they would try such a thing," said 
O'Campo, a thin Mexican-American woman whose fluffy, light-brown hair frames 
her face. "I always trusted the grandparents, and I wanted her to love them, so 
I let them see her. I always thought they were on my side." 
</P>
<P>
In a panic, O'Campo called police, the U.S. attorney in Phoenix and the FBI, 
asking them to intervene, to do something. Their response provided little 
comfort: There was no crime of kidnaping, they told her, because she had 
released Earlene willingly. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, since the dispute had happened on the reservation, it was a tribal 
matter. Because the nation's Indian reservations are essentially sovereign 
federal enclaves exempt from state laws, tribes have the authority to decide 
most civil matters and all but the most serious criminal cases that arise on 
their lands and involve American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the discouraging news, O'Campo remained convinced that Lee was 
bluffing, that, once confronted, he would return the child. When she arrived in 
Parker, however, that hope abruptly faded: O'Campo was served with tribal court 
orders granting temporary custody to Lee and barring her from removing Earlene 
pending further action by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw those papers, I just cried," O'Campo said. Later, she called Lee's 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Why are you doing this? What have I ever done to you?' I asked her. All she 
would say was, 'You'll have your day in court.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lee, a local mine worker, has a different story. In documents on file at the 
court of the Colorado River Indian Tribes, he accuses O'Campo of exhibiting 
"ever-changing whims" through the years as to where Earlene should live. 
</P>
<P>
"Grace O'Campo is unable or unwilling to provide a stable, loving and otherwise 
suitable home environment for our daughter Earlene," Lee said in an affidavit. 
On "numerous occasions," he continued, "O'Campo has advised me that she either 
could not or would not handle our daughter Earlene and asked me to take our 
daughter, only to later change her mind and take our daughter Earlene back 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to O'Campo's version, Lee also said she called him Sept. 24 and asked 
that he pick up Earlene and keep her permanently on the reservation in Parker. 
</P>
<P>
O'Campo vehemently denies these assertions, saying that she has never wavered 
in her desire to raise Earlene. But Lee's statements persuaded Chief Tribal 
Judge Neil Flores, who granted his request for temporary custody and a 
restraining order against O'Campo on Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Lee nor his attorney would discuss the case with a reporter. But 
Earlene's grandfather, in an interview at his upholstery shop in Parker, said 
he did not know why his son had launched the court fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why he's doing it, and I don't want to take sides," Leo Lee said. 
"I don't blame her for fighting for her baby. Even animals fight for their 
young. I just wish they'd get together and work this out, because I feel bad 
for the kid." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he believed that O'Campo was an unfit mother, Leo Lee said, "I've 
never seen her hit the kid, if that's what you mean." And his son? "He puts 
food on the table," Leo Lee said, "so I suppose that makes him a good father. 
What do I know?" 
</P>
<P>
After O'Campo and Lee split up, there were no court proceedings to determine 
legal custody of Earlene. O'Campo said she assumed that Lee had no interest in 
raising the girl and did not think that formalizing the matter was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers say that Lee thus was able to place the issue in the hands of the 
tribal court. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is he filed (for custody) first," said Jane Gorman, an Orange 
County attorney familiar with tribal law. "If she had filed in state court, 
then jurisdiction would have been established there. But now that the tribal 
court has the case, it would be very, very hard to convince the state courts to 
take it away." 
</P>
<P>
O'Campo, however, disputes the tribal court's jurisdiction, noting that Lee and 
Earlene are Navajo and not members of the Colorado River Indian Tribes. 
</P>
<P>
But legal experts say that a 1987 decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals upheld tribal jurisdiction over non-member Indians living on the 
reservation. That could change depending on the fate of an appeal now pending 
before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds unfair," said Patrick Romero Guillory, a San Francisco attorney who 
represented the Navajo nation in a recent case involving a disputed adoption. 
"But if the tribal court has declared jurisdiction, then her only remedy may be 
in that court." 
</P>
<P>
Guillory and others say that, regardless of the jurisdictional question, what 
O'Campo needs now is a good attorney. So far, however, her efforts to obtain 
legal help have been fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteer lawyer groups in Phoenix, Yuma and Kingman either lack tribal law 
specialists or say they find it inconvenient to take cases in small, remote 
Parker. She said that a local attorney would take the case only if paid a 
$4,000 retainer. O'Campo's family so far has saved up $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated and sensing that events were whirling out of her control, O'Campo 
made what she concedes was a desperate move last month -- the attempt to spirit 
her daughter out of Arizona. She said conversations with several Parker 
officials gave her hope that Earlene would be beyond the tribal court's reach 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
At 1 p.m. on Nov. 22, O'Campo and an accomplice parked beside some pink 
oleanders in front of Blake Elementary School. Moments later, O'Campo plucked 
her stunned daughter from her classroom as the teacher and dozens of 
schoolchildren screamed. 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, the fleeing pair were dropped off in Lake Havasu City, where 
they intended to catch a bus out of town. The plan was to reunite with 
relatives of O'Campo in San Bernardino for Thanksgiving dinner the next day. 
</P>
<P>
But things did not work out that way. Lake Havasu City police, alerted by 
tribal officials that O'Campo might be in the area, spotted her at the bus stop 
and took her to the station. Despite O'Campo's pleas, local detectives turned 
the matter over to tribal police, who soon drove off with Earlene. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt sorry for the lady. She was crying and very upset," Detective Steve 
Wolf said. "But the Indian police had a court order and said they had authority 
to take the child. I'm no expert in tribal law, but they did have a court 
order." 
</P>
<P>
Tribal Police Chief Stuart Harper said that in seizing Earlene, O'Campo had 
violated the restraining order issued by Judge Flores. Harper said he has asked 
the La Paz County attorney's office to file criminal charges of "custodial 
interference" against O'Campo. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 15, the tribal court will determine where Earlene will spend the next 
12 years of her life. In a telephone interview, Flores said he will consider 
"the ability of each parent to provide proper care, previous custody 
arrangements" and other factors in making his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"It will all depend on what is best for the child," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Awaiting the showdown, O'Campo sits nervously by the phone at her parents' home 
in Parker, two miles from the daughter she is forbidden to see. O'Campo first 
told her story to a local weekly newspaper, the Gem. Sympathy has poured forth, 
but nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
"When this first happened, I felt that once people could hear my story, they 
would know I am in the right," O'Campo said. "Now I see that doesn't matter. I 
know I don't have a chance. But I won't sit down and let them do this to me. I 
won't go home without her."

ABORTION ACTIVISTS IN STAND-OFF; 
</P>
<P>
DEMONSTRATIONS: PROTESTS AT CLINICS IN LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTIES 
CULMINATE IN FULLERTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Hundreds of anti-abortion and pro-choice advocates converged on a Fullerton 
women's clinic Saturday, culminating a morning of rallies and protests at 
various clinics in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
Police estimated the crowd at 300 and said it was equally divided between 
members of Operation Rescue, the anti-abortion group, and by pro-choice forces. 
</P>
<P>
The stand-off was peaceful. Pro-choice advocates rallied in front of the 
Women's Center on Orangethorpe Avenue, singing "Joy to the world, choice has 
come" and other modified Christmas carols. Nearby, anti-abortion protesters sat 
and sometimes kneeled in entrance ways, as they prayed and sang hymns. There 
were no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, anti-abortion activists had skipped from clinic to clinic, apparently 
attempting to elude pro-choice advocates, who were tracking them throughout the 
morning. Both sides claimed victory at rallies that began shortly after noon. 
</P>
<P>
"Our numbers are growing and growing and growing," said Eleanor Smeal, 
president of the Fund for a Feminist Majority, a national abortion rights group 
based in Los Angeles. A crowd that sported blue pro-choice buttons, signs and 
T-shirts cheered. 
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to make this a pro-choice Assembly and a pro-choice 
governor's mansion," said Smeal, past president of the National Organization 
for Women. Moments later, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, a 
Democratic candidate for governor, came to the makeshift podium. 
</P>
<P>
"We will stand shoulder to shoulder until we have our right to protect our 
reproductive freedom," Feinstein said. Women, she said, found "sanctuary" with 
the Roe vs. Wade decision by the Supreme Court that established the legality of 
abortions in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
But in the court's Webster decision, which earlier this year gave states 
broader powers on the abortion issue, "this basing was thrown to a political 
arena and the vagrancies of state legislatures, which are all controlled by 
men," Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 feet away and a short time later, Russ Neal, director of the Southern 
California Operation Rescue, addressed his followers, who carried graphic 
posters, prayer books and Bibles. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a very successful rescue," Neal said. "We have heard that they had a 
full schedule of abortions today and we got here before they opened and before 
those children who would have been killed were killed." 
</P>
<P>
Owners of the clinic could not be reached for comment. Kathy Spillar, national 
coordinator for the Fund for a Feminist Majority, said the facility had planned 
to remain closed Saturday and that no abortions had been scheduled. The clinic 
offers a variety of health services. 
</P>
<P>
Carla Black, a member of Operation Rescue who described herself as a counselor, 
said she persuaded one pregnant woman on her way to the clinic to reconsider 
her plans for an abortion. Black said the woman was taken by other Operation 
Rescue workers to the Crisis Pregnancy Center, which she said was an an 
anti-abortion center that helps pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
The day began early for both sides. Spillar said more than 500 pro-choice 
activists had been dispatched by 5 a.m. to 26 clinics throughout Los Angeles 
and Orange counties that had been considered potential targets of Operation 
Rescue on Saturday. The anti-abortion group had announced it was planning a 
"rescue" -- during which members try to form blockades and keep clinics from 
opening -- but, as in the past, Operation Rescue leaders kept secret the 
precise targets until early Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Before converging in Fullerton, Operation Rescue sent forces to clinics in El 
Monte, Long Beach and Tustin. Pro-choice activists said patients were scheduled 
for early morning appointments and thus managed to avoid protesters at the 
Doctor's Family Planning Clinic on Irvine Boulevard in Tustin. The patients 
were inside before 8 a.m., while Operation Rescue workers did not arrive until 
about half an hour later. In Long Beach, patients also were treated as 
scheduled, pro-choice activists said. They said the El Monte clinic was not 
scheduled to open Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
By 9 a.m. most of the day's activities were focused in Fullerton, where 
pro-choice and anti-abortion activists staged rallies and then lingered until 
the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always fearful people won't cross over the Orange curtain, but Los Angeles 
and Orange County coalesced today in big numbers," said Barbara Jackson, a 
member of the Pro-Choice Coalition of Orange County. "Pro-choice people are 
going to support women's rights anywhere in the country, even Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations were less peaceful in Brookline, Mass., where 60 Operation 
Rescue demonstrators were arrested for blocking patients from entering a 
clinic. Authorities videotaped the anti-abortion protesters and said they would 
use the tapes in a pending civil suit against Operation Rescue. The 
anti-abortion group has been charged under the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt 
Organization law by Brookline officials hoping to recoup overtime costs for 
police assigned to maintain order at the protests. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of pro-choice and anti-abortion activists braved freezing cold 
Saturday to rally at the Brookline clinic.

A cargo ship hit an oil platform in the southern Gulf of Suez, causing millions 
of dollars in damage to the rig but no casualties, a senior oil company 
official said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The platform is owned by Gulf Petroleum Co., or Gupco, a joint 
Egyptian-American venture with major operations in the gulf between mainland 
Egypt and Sinai. 
</P>
<P>
The Gupco official said the collision spilled a small amount of oil from the 
platform into the gulf. He said damage to the platform is expected to exceed 
$10 million.

MOSCOW POLL FINDS SUPPORT FOR REFORMS

About 71% of Muscovites believe reforms should be accelerated, but only 17.6% 
would call Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika a good policy, 
according to a new survey. 
</P>
<P>
The poll was sponsored by the French economic magazine l'Expansion and 
state-run France Inter radio. It was conducted by the Center for Political 
Studies of the Soviet Union, which questioned 922 people in Moscow between Nov. 
1 and Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Only 3.8% of the Muscovites questioned thought the economic situation had 
improved in recent years. But 57.6% thought Gorbachev's policies will be 
successful in the next five years, against 32.5% who were doubtful they will 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Communism still was favored by about 36% of Muscovites polled, but 29% admitted 
being against it, with 33% cautiously refusing to reply. As many as 34% said 
they favored capitalism, 37% said they opposed it and 28.2% said they were 
undecided.

WEST EUROPE LEADERS BACK REUNIFICATION OF GERMANY 
</P>

<P>
Leaders of the European Community declared here Saturday that they approve of 
German reunification through "free self-determination." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a two-day conference, the heads of the 12 EC 
governments said the world is witnessing "historic events" in Europe that are 
"no doubt the most important since the Second World War." 
</P>
<P>
The statement added: "We seek the strengthening of the state of peace in 
Europe, in which the German people will regain its unity through free 
self-determination." 
</P>
<P>
And French President Francois Mitterrand, who is also EC chairman for the 
current six months, declared later: "I am not afraid of German reunification. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider it legitimate," he said, though he added that there are many 
international obligations that the Germans would have to consider in moving 
toward unity. 
</P>
<P>
The declaration was viewed here as a resounding victory for West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who told a news briefing that he was more than 
satisfied with the outcome of the twice-yearly EC summit conference. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Kohl bowed to Mitterrand's insistence that a meeting be convened a 
year from now that would begin planning a common European currency and monetary 
system. 
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's final summit session, emphasis shifted from debate on a common 
monetary system -- which will be discussed for years to come -- to the issue of 
improving ties with the nations of Eastern Europe, which are undergoing what 
amounts to a bloodless revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The EC's statement said: "Each day in Central and Eastern Europe, change is 
asserting itself more strongly. The people are clearly showing their will to 
take their own destiny in hand and to choose the path of their development." 
</P>
<P>
The EC pledged various kinds of financial assistance to East European nations, 
including a development bank, a stabilization fund for Poland, an adjustment 
loan for Hungary, a foundation to create professional training for East 
European managers and observer status for the Soviet Union in the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
To show that the West European nations are on the side of stable evolution in 
Eastern Europe's shift toward democracy, summit leaders emphasized that changes 
"should take place peacefully and democratically." 
</P>
<P>
"The changes and transitions which are necessary must not take place to the 
detriment of the stability of Europe, but rather must contribute to 
strengthening it," their statement said. 
</P>
<P>
The Western leaders emphasized that they are not trying to take advantage of 
the political turmoil in Eastern Europe, declaring they want to develop closer 
relations with the Soviet Union and other countries in the East "insofar as 
they are committed to democratic change." 
</P>
<P>
"The community has decided to support the economic reforms undertaken in these 
countries by contributing -- in collaboration with its Western partners -- to 
the establishment of healthy and prosperous economies," the final communication 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
The EC heads of government complimented Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
by saying, "Such a profound and rapid development (in Eastern Europe) could not 
have been possible without the policy of openness and reform led by Mr. 
Gorbachev." 
</P>
<P>
The leaders also said the EC will remain the "cornerstone" for a "new European 
architecture" that will forge closer ties with nations of the European Free 
Trade Assn. -- Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Finland and Iceland -- and 
eventually with the nations in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Their final statement stressed that the best way of keeping the United States 
and Canada linked to Europe is through the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, a 35-nation group now meeting in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
"The building of European (Community) union will permit the further development 
of a range of effective and harmonious relations with the other countries of 
Europe," the leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher appeared to be left behind. She 
opposed the summit's Saturday statement about setting up a conference to forge 
a joint European monetary system, and she refused to go along with a so-called 
Social Charter for workers that was also agreed to Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
While some diplomats agreed with her view that the monetary conference would 
run into many problems when it came to working out details, most said that her 
position and views are becoming increasingly irrelevant at the summit meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"She opposes everything," one diplomat said, "but says she will stay in -- and 
go along with the decisions. Nobody takes her seriously any more."

<TEXT>
<P>
After two decades of tumult and conflict under Marxist rule and right-wing 
dictatorship, Chile's politicians are displaying unaccustomed harmony on the 
eve of the nation's return to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The center-left "rainbow coalition" predicts landslide victories in 
presidential and congressional elections Thursday to replace the military 
government of President Augusto Pinochet. Right-wing parties hope for at least 
a decent showing in House and Senate races. 
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, the army general who seized power in a 1973 coup against Marxist 
President Salvador Allende, has been rushing through an array of laws designed 
to imprint his indelible stamp on Chilean life for years to come. The laws 
limit the next government's control over economic policy, military decisions, 
television broadcasting, Supreme Court membership and numerous other 
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
But Chile's principal conservative party, National Renovation, has opted to 
stand firmly with the coalition in opposing Pinochet's attempt to leave his 
successors with little to govern when they take office next March. Working 
together, the rival political movements have managed to limit the damage and in 
the process raise hopes of a political future more prone to consensus and 
accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
Patricio Aylwin, the genial 71-year-old leader of the Christian Democratic 
Party who almost certainly will succeed Pinochet, has led the chorus of 
complaints against Pinochet's "11th-hour laws." Aylwin, who leads the 17-party 
center-left alliance, said in a campaign speech that the laws are "clearly 
aimed at tying the hands of the next government." 
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic Church also condemned the measures, saying that such major 
decisions should be left to the elected president and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The changes adopted or being considered by the four-man military junta, which 
serves as Pinochet's legislature, include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- An administrative law guaranteeing the tenure of the nation's 82,500 civil 
servants, most hired during the Pinochet years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A proposed armed forces law that would give the service branches broad 
authority over promotions and the military budget. (Army commander Pinochet's 
1980 constitution already allows him and the other branch chiefs to keep those 
posts for up to eight more years.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- A law granting autonomy to the central bank and largely removing monetary 
policy from the executive branch, with a governing board appointed by Pinochet 
and immune from removal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A law offering Supreme Court justices over 75 a chance to retire with a 
$17,000 payoff. Eight of 10 eligible justices accepted, allowing Pinochet to 
name their successors on the 17-member panel. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The appointments of more than 300 mayors, development council officials and 
government board members who cannot be removed except for misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Pinochet has said that he merely wants to ensure institutional stability in the 
future. He notes wryly that he is not the first outgoing president to decree 
measures before leaving office. 
</P>
<P>
Several political analysts contend that Pinochet likely would have gone further 
had not the National Renovation party joined the opposition in criticizing some 
measures and calling for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, National Renovation joined in pressing for negotiations on the 
appointments to the new, powerful central bank board. The government announced 
last week that after talks with all the political parties, an agreement had 
been reached. The board members include two pro-Pinochet men, two economists 
from the opposition alliance and an independent chairman. 
</P>
<P>
National Renovation represents Chile's traditional political right and often 
has chafed at Pinochet's derision of politicians. Sergio Onofre Jarpa, the 
party leader, only grudgingly ceded the right's presidential candidacy to 
boyish Hernan Buchi, a Pinochet loyalist who served as finance minister until 
March. 
</P>
<P>
Most polls give Aylwin a roughly 2 to 1 lead over Buchi and suggest that he 
will win a simple majority Thursday. A third candidate, right-wing populist 
businessman Francisco Javier Errazuriz, may attract enough votes to deny Aylwin 
a first-round victory over Buchi, forcing a runoff race in February. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis Cea, an independent constitutional expert who advises National 
Renovation, said the party's role would be pivotal for an Aylwin government, 
allowing it to limit the influence of leftist parties. He said a strong 
National Renovation showing would force Aylwin to stay in the political center 
and thus bolster business leaders' confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Cea said Pinochet's last-minute legislation harked back to the first secretive 
years of the dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
"It is fundamentally contrary to the democratic spirit to pass these laws 
without debate or consensus. They are obviously meant to hamstring the future 
government and to control its use of resources," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Lagos, a former Allende ally in the old Socialist Party who now heads 
the left-of-center Party for Democracy, said in a television debate: "There is 
now a substantial amount of maturity in Chilean politics. We recognize that we 
need to discuss health problems, schools and other important issues, and not 
rehash the old ideological debates." 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say that the campaign entirely lacks old-fashioned wrangles. 
Buchi accuses the Christian Democrats of cutting deals with the Communist 
Party, several of whose members are running as independents. An Aylwin victory, 
Buchi insists, will resurrect the strife of the Allende years and unravel the 
Pinochet era free-market economic reforms that have given Chile the most 
impressive growth statistics in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
And the coalition's candidates -- who uniformly vow to leave the economic 
program's main features intact -- often accuse the right of suddenly 
discovering the democratic spirit after supporting Pinochet all these years. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the atmosphere is far more relaxed than during the plebiscite campaign, 
when police regularly fired barrages of tear gas at rock-throwing anti-Pinochet 
demonstrators and reports circulated of government plans to cancel the vote at 
the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Frei Jr., a Senate candidate and son of a former Christian Democratic 
president, referred at a campaign rally to the demise of Chile's penchant for 
tumult -- and implicitly criticized his own party's undermining of the Allende 
government in the early 1970s, setting the stage for Pinochet's coup. 
</P>
<P>
"We have learned the lessons of the past," he said. "We are going to support 
this government from the first day to the last. We have proved able to reach 
agreements among many sectors with those who think differently. We understand 
what modern democracy means -- conciliation and accord."

INQUIRY INTO 6 JESUITS' SLAYING FOCUSES ON ARMY;

<TEXT>
<P>
President Alfredo Cristiani said Saturday that the official investigation into 
last month's assassinations of six Jesuit priests is focusing on the Salvadoran 
armed forces, but he refused to blame the murders on the military. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani said FBI and Salvadoran investigators have the names of all soldiers 
posted in the area of Central American University on Nov. 16, the night the 
priests, their cook and her daughter were shot to death at the Jesuit residence 
there. Sources close to the investigation said interrogations of the nearly 200 
soldiers and their commanding officers have begun, and some of the men will be 
required to take lie-detector tests. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani also said that he is willing to resume peace talks with the 
guerrillas battling his government if the rebels stop fighting in civilian 
areas by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
He said that representatives of the two sides could meet in Caracas, Venezuela, 
beginning Dec. 20 to arrange a cease-fire and negotiate a peace by Feb. 15. 
After that, he said, the rebels would be expected to join the political 
process. 
</P>
<P>
The president, who is under intense pressure from the United States to solve 
the killings of the priests, offered a $250,000 reward, immunity from 
prosecution and protection to witnesses who "indirectly participated" in the 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Cristiani asserted that the only witness to come 
forward so far in the case -- a cleaning woman who was spirited to Miami under 
heavy guard after testifying before a Salvadoran judge -- has recanted her 
statement under FBI questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Roman Catholic Church officials have privately protested the U.S. 
interrogations of Lucia Barrera de Cerna, who earlier had testified she saw 
uniformed gunmen enter the university the night of the murders. Since arriving 
in Miami, Barrera de Cerna reportedly changed her story twice as she was 
submitted to six polygraph tests over a three-day period, according to sources 
involved in the investigation. She failed all six tests, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Church officials suggested that the woman might have been coerced or 
intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
But William Walker, U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, denied that the woman had 
been pressured and said he was disappointed that her testimony may not be 
usable. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would anyone think . . . we would go to all that trouble (of relocating 
her and her family to Miami) just to discredit her?" he said. "Our efforts are 
to get to the truth.. . . I think (the investigation) is moving just as fast as 
(the government's) operational capacity allows." 
</P>
<P>
American officials have said that both the survival of Cristiani's 
administration and the continuance of U.S. aid to El Salvador -- more than $1 
million a day -- could be in danger if the Jesuit case is not solved. 
</P>
<P>
The priests, including university rector Ignacio Ellacuria, were killed during 
an overnight curfew in an area that had been militarized because of a fierce 
guerrilla offensive launched in the capital Nov. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Two army units were stationed less than a mile from the campus that night, and 
Treasury Police were posted at a vacant office building about 500 yards from 
the site of the murders, sources close to the investigation said. Security 
forces had searched the university residence three days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"We obviously now are gearing the major strength of the investigation within . 
. . the armed forces," Cristiani said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Cristiani's Cabinet and the armed forces have publicly blamed the 
killings on leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) rebels. 
Cristiani said he would wait for investigators to determine the culprits but 
added that he could not rule out the armed forces, the extreme right or the 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani spoke at a press conference shortly before boarding a flight to San 
Jose, Costa Rica, for a Central American summit scheduled to start today. He 
will join the presidents of Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua for a 
two-day meeting aimed at salvaging a regional peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year-old plan was dealt a near-fatal blow last month when El Salvador 
suspended diplomatic relations with Nicaragua for allegedly supplying weapons 
to the Salvadoran rebels. The Salvadoran government had discovered a shipment 
of anti-aircraft missiles aboard a Nicaraguan government plane apparently 
destined for the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani, remarking on another unsolved case of political violence, blamed the 
Oct. 31 bombing of a crowded union hall, which left 10 people dead, on FMLN 
rebels. He said a captured guerrilla had told authorities the bombing was 
designed to "create martyrs" for the leftist insurgency.

KIDNAP ATTEMPT ENDS AT POLICE STATION; 2 SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An attempted kidnaping of a man, a woman and a newborn baby ended outside the 
police station in the city of Orange on Saturday when the suspected kidnaper 
shot the man and a police officer shot the gunman, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect and victim were in guarded condition in hospitals, Orange police 
Sgt. Art Romo said. The woman and the baby were not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the kidnaping were sketchy. Police said the incident began about 3 
p.m. in Riverside, when Nelson Preves, 45, of Santa Ana, was driving a pickup 
truck, with Esines Rodriguez, 23, of Orange, and Rodriguez's day-old infant boy 
in the passenger seat. They were confronted by four Latino men in a small gray 
car, Romo said. He said there was an argument over a drug dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Emilio Sitt Garcia, 19, of Santa Ana, who police said had a 
.45-caliber automatic handgun, ordered Preves to drive to Santa Ana and jumped 
in the back of the pickup, Romo said. 
</P>
<P>
But Preves drove instead to the Orange police station. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, holding the baby, jumped out and ran toward a motorcycle police 
officer, who was about 10 feet away. Garcia jumped from the bed of the truck 
into the cab, where he wrestled with Preves, and the gun went off, wounding 
Preves in the chest, Romo said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer saw the gun in Garcia's hand and fired several rounds, at least one 
of which struck him, Romo said.

SOUTHEASTERN STATES PELTED BY SNOW AND FREEZING RAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Snow and freezing rain fell in several Southeastern states Saturday, a day 
after an onslaught that left up to a foot of snow in parts of the East. Much of 
the Northeast remained in the grip of a cold spell. 
</P>
<P>
Sleet and freezing rain damaged trees and power lines Saturday in central 
Georgia, and an inch of ice covered roads between the towns of Gordon and 
Irwinton. Parts of northern Georgia were coated with up to 3 inches of snow by 
mid-afternoon, and there were reports of deeper snow in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the Atlanta area reported snowflakes the size of cotton balls. 
</P>
<P>
"There's about an inch of snow in my yard, and snowflakes falling the size of 
half-dollars," said one resident of the suburb of Chamblee. "It's the prettiest 
snow I have seen in my years in Atlanta." 
</P>
<P>
Snow also was scattered over western North Carolina, with almost 6 inches 
covering Mt. Mitchell and 4 inches in Boone. Freezing rain and sleet extended 
over southeast Virginia and central North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Cold weather continued in much of the Northeast. The early-morning temperature 
was 7 degrees in Harrisburg, Pa., where the old mark of 10 had stood since 
1917. Saturday's low for the Lower 48 states was 16 degrees below zero at 
Montpelier, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
Although snow and rain were still falling in the South, the wintry storm that 
had walloped the mid-Atlantic Coast and the South crept out to sea Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in parts of the East were forecast to climb today and begin 
melting away the glaze of ice that was as thick as 1 inch in the heart of 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
But the National Weather Service issued a statement saying that another storm 
might strike Monday and dump more snow in parts of the East. 
</P>
<P>
The wintry onslaught Friday left up to a foot of snow in parts of Delaware, 
Maryland, the Washington, D.C., area, northern Virginia and West Virginia. 
Smaller amounts fell over most of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, the mountains of 
Tennessee and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
The icy blast also struck parts of the Midwest and Mississippi Valley, dumping 
varying amounts of snow. Freezing rain fell from southeast Arkansas into 
southwest Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
A dangerous sheet of ice formed over many areas hit by the storm, including 
roads in most of North Carolina, where two people died early Saturday in a car 
crash in Cumberland County, highway patrol Sgt. D. W. Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
The weather also was blamed for the deaths of a total of 13 other people in 
accidents Thursday and Friday in five states.

Kaolelo Ulaleo remembers trekking with his grandmother into the rain forest, an 
enchanting place where feathery ferns grew tall enough to dwarf a small boy. 
</P>
<P>
She taught him to pull roots from the moist earth to make tea and pick berries 
for traditional home remedies. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, Wao Kele is the spoon that feeds you," said 41-year-old Ulaleo, who 
has continued to visit the forest throughout his adult life. "You come inside, 
and everywhere is God." 
</P>
<P>
Today, other visitors have come to the forest that Ulaleo treasures, known as 
Wao Kele o Puna, or Rain Belt of Puna, on the island of Hawaii. Their mark is 
less subtle. 
</P>
<P>
The bulldozers of True Geothermal Energy Co. have cleared several acres of 
trees and tangled undergrowth in hopes of tapping volcanic steam for a 
25-megawatt power plant. In the process, the industrial newcomers have taken 
center stage in the struggle over the future of the last major tract of lowland 
tropical rain forest in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents in Hawaii and on the mainland argue that geothermal development could 
destroy a unique and fragile ecosystem by slicing through it with a web of 
pipes, generators and transmission lines. Hawaii's forests are especially 
prized because most of their plants and animals are found nowhere else in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest danger to any tropical forest is fragmentation," said Dan Taylor, 
chief of resources management at nearby Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. "It can 
only go so far before the whole system collapses." 
</P>
<P>
Formal challenges have quietly and laboriously made their way through the 
courts and government hearing rooms for years. Ironically, geothermal energy is 
usually considered an environmentally benign alternative, and partly for that 
reason, the early local skirmishes attracted little notice beyond Hawaii's 
shores. But the issue of the rain forest changed all that. 
</P>
<P>
"How can we expect to save the rain forests in Brazil and Malaysia if we can't 
save our own?" asked Suzanne Head of the San Francisco-based Rainforest Action 
Network, which has seized on the case as a test for the environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
As drilling begins in the forest, the struggle has moved into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Five people were arrested in late October for trying to block trucks hauling 
equipment to the site, 3 miles deep into the rain forest. Two weeks ago, 
protesters staged sit-ins at the offices of Gov. John Waihee and held all-night 
vigils outside to dramatize their call for a moratorium on geothermal 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Wao Kele o Puna is just part of a sprawling geothermal resource zone designated 
by the state on the eastern slope of Kilauea Volcano. An ambitious plan 
designed to promote Hawaii's energy independence calls for geothermal plants to 
produce up to 500 megawatts of power, much of it to be carried through undersea 
pipes to Honolulu and elsewhere in this island chain. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years the plan has provoked opposition from various quarters, with the 
arguments ranging from the spiritual to the practical. 
</P>
<P>
Some native Hawaiians consider geothermal drilling a violation of the volcano 
goddess, Pele, and have appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, without 
success. Now they are challenging the legality of the state's transfer of 
27,000 acres of forest land, including Wao Kele o Puna, to a private estate for 
development. The case is on appeal to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby residents, soured by noise and noxious fumes from a small, experimental 
plant outside the forest, have argued against geothermal development on health 
and safety grounds. They also question the wisdom of drilling near an active 
volcano. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue that has grabbed the most attention in this environmentally 
conscious age is the threat to the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just a native Hawaiian struggle any more," said Palikapu Dedman, 
president of the Pele Defense Fund, which has led the legal fight. "It's 
everybody's struggle now." 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii's once extensive lowland forests have been all but consumed since the 
first Polynesian voyagers arrived. The Puna forest's inaccessibility and 
proximity to the volcano have helped protect it, until now. Naturalists argue 
that a geothermal network in the area would hasten the invasion of aggressive, 
non-native species that have decimated other areas. They also fear the effects 
of noise, lights and emissions on wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Tropical rain forests have moved to the forefront of environmental concerns in 
the past few years as fears over global warming have heightened. The forests 
are considered crucibles of life itself because they help regulate the Earth's 
climate and house nearly half of all plant and animal species. But these rich 
habitats are fast disappearing as developing countries clear vast areas for 
timber or agriculture. An estimated 50 million acres a year is destroyed 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists blame global warming on such deforestation and the burning of wood 
and fossil fuels. Leaders of industrialized nations, including President Bush, 
have called on their Third World counterparts to stop the plunder of the rain 
forests. Although Wao Kele o Puna is tiny by comparison to other tropical 
forests, environmentalists consider it strategically important to their 
crusade. 
</P>
<P>
The 25,000-member Rainforest Action Network has begun distributing leaflets to 
Hawaii-bound travelers at West Coast airports, with fluorescent green stickers 
that read "Save Hawaii's rain forests. Stop the Big Island power plant, or I 
stop traveling." It also plans a demonstration Dec. 14 at True Geothermal's 
Casper, Wyo., headquarters and simultaneous protests in Hawaii and California. 
And it is calling for a boycott of Hawaii-made products. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have emotional attachments to Hawaii because it's unique and 
beautiful," Head said. "Given the visibility of the rain forest issue and the 
fact that this one is in our country, I think there is a pretty good chance of 
actually stopping the project." 
</P>
<P>
But geothermal energy has strong allies in Hawaii. Along with the electric 
utility, the state government promotes geothermal power as a cheap, clean and 
indigenous source of energy. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the options, geothermal continues to be the most attractive," said 
Maurice Kaya of the state's energy program office. "The power is available 24 
hours a day, and the money doesn't leave the state." 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii depends on oil, most of it foreign, for 90% of its energy needs. While 
the islands have abundant wind and sunshine, those energy sources are 
intermittent and expensive compared to geothermal, Kaya said. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Kawada, Hawaii representative for True Geothermal, said the company chose 
to drill here because of the state's commitment to geothermal energy. The 
developer, he noted, has already endured an exhaustive permit process and plans 
to use just 350 acres of the forest. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone through about seven years of regulatory approvals," he said. "These 
issues have all been discussed at length many times, not just once. We feel we 
have the right to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
Geothermal development was originally slated for another forest, known as 
Kahaualea, further upland on the volcano's rift zone. But naturalists -- and 
nature itself -- intervened. While the proposed drilling was being contested as 
a threat to a pristine native ecosystem, Kilauea Volcano began to erupt in 1983 
and eventually buried much of the area in fresh lava. Some native Hawaiians 
suggest that Pele was making her feelings known about geothermal development. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the state Board of Land and Natural Resources agreed to exchange the 
private estate lands at Kahaualea for the state-owned Wao Kele o Puna to allow 
geothermal development in the lowland forest. Environmentalists supported the 
trade because, like most highland areas, Kahaualea's ecosystem was more intact 
than Wao Kele o Puna. But that hasn't stopped them from trying to save Wao Kele 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Those same people were who were saying 'Go down to the Natural Area Reserve' 
are now saying that we should preserve it," complained Kawada, shaking his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Lamoureux, a professor of botany at the University of Hawaii and a 
consultant to the developer, contends that the threat to the Wao Kele has been 
exaggerated. The forest is not pristine, and drilling sites were chosen to 
minimize the impact on native ecosystems, he said. He also discounts the threat 
of emissions, noting that 
</P>
<P>
wildlife here has evolved around volcanic activity. 
</P>
<P>
"There are patches of good forest and there are patches that aren't," Lamoureux 
said. "The best lowland forest is outside of the geothermal zone. . . . We're 
talking about meddling with an area that has already been trashed by strawberry 
guava, mynah birds and wild pigs (non-native species). I'm not convinced this 
project will have any measurable effect." 
</P>
<P>
But other natural scientists disagree. While foreign plants have infested parts 
of the Puna forest, much of it is considered a rare collection of varied 
ecosystems that have sprung up after successive lava flows over the centuries. 
The forest also boasts large populations of native birds, which elsewhere have 
fled to higher elevations. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a mosaic of different aged forests, from 600 years to the present," 
said Jim Jacobi, a botanist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who has 
mapped native vegetation throughout Hawaii. "It's a really dynamic set of 
ecosystems that doesn't exist anywhere else in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost so many areas in Hawaii," he added. "What little we have left is 
priceless." 
</P>
<P>
Because of its distance from any major land mass, Hawaii is considered a 
storehouse of revolutionary wonders. Only a few seeds, birds and insects were 
hardy enough to make their way here after the first volcanic cones burst 
through the ocean's surface millions of years ago. From those few early 
arrivals, a plethora of native species have evolved. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the most isolated islands on the face of the Earth," noted Taylor. 
"More than 90% of Hawaii's biota are endemic, which means they are found only 
here, a far higher rate than anywhere else. So they're of tremendous interest. 
</P>
<P>
"We have many lessons to learn," he said. "But we're tossing the books out 
before we've read them."

SUBMARINE'S WOES COST CAPTAIN HIS COMMAND

<P>
The commander of the San Diego-based submarine that snared a tugboat in June 
has been relieved of command because of the fatal accident and two other 
incidents, Navy officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Citing lack of confidence, Navy officials relieved Cmdr. John H. Sohl III of 
his command of the nuclear-powered Houston. The submarine was on standby during 
the filming of the movie "Hunt for Red October" when it snagged a 1,000-foot 
steel cable and sank the tugboat Barcona 10 miles southwest of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Two tugboat crew members survived, but the pilot, Bryan Ballanger, 32, drowned. 
The Barcona went down in less than a minute in waters 2,500 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
Sohl, an 11-year Navy veteran, was relieved Friday. He was given a punitive 
letter of reprimand by Rear Adm. Michael C. Colley, Commander Submarine Force, 
U.S. Pacific Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
The June 14 sinking, which was apparently without precedent in U.S. Navy 
history, was the first of three incidents that ultimately cost Sohl his 
command. 
</P>
<P>
On July 9, Sohl was in charge when several hundred gallons of water poured in 
through the air ventilation system of the submarine during routine exercises 
and forced the crew to twice conduct emergency surfacing operations off the 
Southern California coast, said Lt. Sonya Hedley, spokeswoman for the U.S. 
Pacific Fleet's submarine force. 
</P>
<P>
The flooding caused the ship to plunge well below the surface and after an 
emergency de-ballasting, it resurfaced. But because it was not correctly 
ballasted for the surface, the Houston took a nose dive down to a depth of 350 
feet. Using emergency procedures again, Sohl brought the vessel back up to 
"snorkeling depth," Hedley said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 120 crew members were injured as the submarine yo-yoed up and down 
in the water, she said. "It was well within safety range." 
</P>
<P>
The incident was caused by a faulty valve that failed to close, said Hedley, 
who declined to answer whether this failure was linked to poor ship 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
The third episode involving the Houston occurred last month, again off the 
Southern California coast. Sohl had apparently come close to an underwater 
obstacle, Hedley said. To avoid the obstacle, the commander backed up the 
submarine and the vessel's propeller cut its sonar cable, which trails behind 
the submarine like a long fishing line. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Sohl received a punitive letter of reprimand from the Navy 
concerning this incident, saying the Houston had cut its cable "because of 
improper navigation and ship operation procedures." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to these three mishaps, the Houston was plagued by other smaller 
troubles, sources said. Several days after the sinking of the Barcona, the 
Houston sliced through fishing nets in the Catalina Channel. In August, when 
the vessel was at sea, batter spilled out of a cake pan and smoldered, posing a 
potential fire hazard. 
</P>
<P>
Sohl's performance, especially the sinking of the tugboat Barcona, has been 
criticized by a number of Navy experts. 
</P>
<P>
The Houston hooked the cable connecting the Barcona to two empty barges. The 
submarine pulled the tug backward and instantly yanked it down into the water. 
Two crew members swam to one of the barges and later saw the Houston surface 
100 yards away. The submarine crew made no effort to communicate with the two 
men, who were picked up by a private vessel, said Ralph Larison, president of 
Connolly-Pacific, which owns the Barcona. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has said that the accident occurred at 4:43 a.m., but the Houston did 
not notify the Coast Guard until 6:40 a.m. The episode is still under 
investigation, and there is no explanation for the time lag, Hedley said. 
</P>
<P>
"But you cannot stop a submarine on a dime," Hedley said. "And the time lag was 
not for any reasons of trying to conceal anything. They came up as soon as they 
could." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, were more critical. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothered me that the submarine didn't pick up the survivors," said James 
Bush, a retired Navy captain and former submarine commander who now works with 
the Washington-based Center for Defense Information.

WORLD ON A PLATTER;

<P>
A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLING OF ENOUGH EXQUISITELY ETHNICRESTAURANTS TO SATISFY 
ORANGE COUNTY EPICURES OF EVERY TASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A new breed of ethnic restaurant is exploding in Orange County: Familiar but 
under-exploited cuisines are having themselves a field day. Thank the media 
revolution. Thank the Concorde. Thank your lucky stars. 
</P>
<P>
Small ethnic places with relatively exotic pedigrees (say, Vietnamese, Cuban or 
Thai) have been satisfying from the outset. Their cooking came to us largely 
intact, with few preconceived notions about our tastes. The more familiar 
cuisines haven't been as reliable. There was a time when French, Chinese and 
Mexican restaurateurs doctored their mothers' recipes indiscriminately, the 
better not to offend our pristine palates. But a new generation of owners knows 
that doesn't attract a crowd anymore, and their approach is slowly changing. 
</P>
<P>
Eating in one of their restaurants is like being on native soil. Ambience is 
seductively authentic. Menus can be written in other languages, the better to 
capture the essence of dishes English cannot describe. An increasing number of 
chefs and ingredients are home-grown. The result is food that is helping to 
dispel notions about some of our favorite cuisines -- and food that is more 
appealing than ever. See for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
FRANCE 
</P>
<P>
Pascal Olhats is moving up in the world and he's doing it his own way. He has 
come a long way since working at Lyon's Paul Bocuse and he knows quality when 
he sees it. His restaurant, called Pascal, is a class act. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, most of his work has been confined to his smart, ultra-modern 
kitchen. That's where Olhats first developed la cuisine reelle, an 
interpretation of Provencale cooking, the food of France's south coast. It drew 
critical raves and a steady clientele. 
</P>
<P>
Today, something is different. The chef has moved out of the kitchen at lunch 
to schmooze the business crowd and keep an eye on his staff. The food has 
changed too, and has gotten better. Call it experience. 
</P>
<P>
Olhats has recently hired Laurent Talon, a young chef from Brasserie Flo in 
Paris who has a painter's touch. Though the emphasis is still on Provence, the 
food is more impressionistic, lighter than ever. A bouillabaisse with pasta at 
lunch tasted almost Italian. 
</P>
<P>
There's also an amazing lamb salad with an apple walnut dressing, a shank of 
veal sprinkled with shallot and tarragon that tastes wonderfully fresh, and a 
palette of vegetables like spinach and yellow tomato that would have made 
Renoir's mouth water. Where is all the butter and cream? "We are saving it for 
a rainy day," answers the owner with a mischievous grin. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant still retains the look of a sunny country cottage; the ambience 
is casual rather than stiff. You have to come in at night to get Olhats' 
signature panier des crudities, a wicker basket filled with raw vegetables, and 
appetizer accompaniments of tapenade (a Provencale olive pate) and anchoyade 
(anchovy butter) that are served before dinner begins. Then you can eat food 
cooked by Pascal himself. 
</P>
<P>
The owner is still in the kitchen every night, sauteeing fresh sea bass, 
dipping strawberries in meringue and preparing the special wine dinners he 
hosts with frequency. Plus ca change, as they say. You may argue that Pascal is 
not Orange County's best small French restaurant, but you will have to agree it 
is most resolutely French. 
</P>
<P>
 Pascal, Plaza Newport, 1000 Bristol St., Newport Beach. (714) 752-0107. Open 
Mondays through Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., and Mondays through Saturdays 
from 6:30 p.m. Dinner for two (food only) $35-$60. All major cards. 
</P>
<P>
JAPANESE 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, sushi has been the acceptable form of Japanese cuisine 
available locally, due to an absence of Japanese chefs and a general lack of 
awareness about what the Japanese really eat. Now, a restaurant called Kitayama 
has come along to rock the boat. 
</P>
<P>
Sushi may be fun to eat, but it is just a snack food in Japan, no more 
representative of a national kitchen than heroes or hamburgers. But thanks to 
an influx of Japanese business in the area, demand for upscale Japanese cooking 
finally reached the flash point. So a company called Kodaniya Inc. (owners of 
Tokyo Kaikan in Los Angeles) decided to do something about it. The result is 
Orange County's best Japanese restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
First off, it is a restaurant blessed with great beauty, a mock temple replete 
with white fir, traditional lamps, elegant screens and a garden courtyard. If 
your date isn't impressed, then chances are the relationship won't last. And 
then there is the exquisite food, prepared by a team of eight Tokyo chefs 
imported expressly to work in this restaurant. Their artistry is beyond 
reproach. 
</P>
<P>
Come for kaiseki, a multi-course feast where the chefs really get a chance to 
strut their stuff. Kaiseki is a parade of artfully presented, bite-sized 
morsels which represent various stations of the Japanese kitchen. Zensai, 
appetizers, might be an exquisitely sauteed scallop, wrapped to look like a 
plum, or a faux wild chestnut made from tiny yellow noodles. Fried, steamed, 
stewed and vinegared courses may range from nouvelle French to rigidly 
Japanese. It's an overwhelming experience. 
</P>
<P>
The one caveat here is a Japanese-language menu which changes every day, the 
real core of Kitayama's kitchen. This is a restaurant where you'll just have to 
gamble on things you may never have experienced, and break away from the 
tempura and teriyaki which the less accomplished restaurants thrive on. Odds 
are, you'll hit the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitayama, 101 Bayview Place, Newport Beach. (714) 725-0777. Open Mondays 
through Fridays 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., daily from 6 to 10:30 p.m. Dinner for two 
(food only) $25-$100. All major cards. 
</P>
<P>
MEXICAN 
</P>
<P>
You certainly can make a case against calling Kachina a Mexican restaurant. 
David Wilhelm, the consultant (El Torito G-R-I-L-L) who conceived the 
restaurant, would be wont to do so. The chef, Thomas Tran, is Vietnamese. So 
sue me. 
</P>
<P>
All Wilhelm and Tran have done is to take some of the very best ingredients 
used in the Mexican kitchen, and some of the very best regional recipes used in 
classic Mexican cookbooks, and improvise on them with skill and wit. The result 
is another of the area's best restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
If you aren't sufficiently dazzled by the trendy elegance (lots of Southwestern 
art, glowing, almost translucent lighting, adobe-style walls of burnt ochre), 
then try this on for size: Blue corn taquitos with smoked chicken and green 
chilies in avocado sauce, grilled swordfish with desert sunset sauce and pink 
grapefruit salsa. If these dishes had any more color, you'd have to wear 
sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
But my favorite of Wilhelm's creations is the gulf shrimp with green corn 
tamale. Wilhelm has long made great tamales but this has to be his crowning 
achievement, a steaming hot, pudding-soft clump, the kind of side dish they 
only dream about south of the border. He blankets the tamale in a pale green 
sauce that tastes of wild herbs and desert air. 
</P>
<P>
Another wonderful dish is the goat cheese relleno with crisp cornmeal coating 
and papaya red-onion salsa. It's crunchy -- like its look-alike, the Zagnut 
candy bar -- and you crack it like a pinata. The cheese just dribbles out like 
molten lava. With the jumbled and eccentric salsa, you have early Jackson 
Pollock, edible art. It's typical of the kitchen's style. 
</P>
<P>
Kachina may not serve food like abuelita used to make, but old gringos like me 
could care less. Pass us a jalapeno muffin, and we'll follow you anywhere. This 
food is here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Kachina, 222 Forest Ave., Laguna Beach. (714) 497-5540. Open nightly from 5:30 
to 10 p.m. Dinner for two (food only) $35-$60. All major cards. 
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN 
</P>
<P>
American cuisine can be ethnic too, especially when our local specialties are 
given a broad overview. Some might bristle at hearing Trees referred to as 
American, but that is the way managers describe it and I'm inclined to agree. 
It's a bit upscale for down-home fare; prices on the hefty side, lots of fussy 
art on the walls, and soft lighting that looks as if it comes from a design 
studio in Milan. There's nowhere else like it in these parts. 
</P>
<P>
The menu can be fussy too, with an odd assortment of Chinese, Thai and Italian 
appetizers that look oddly out of place amid the meat loaf, pan-fried oysters 
and chicken-fried steak to be had from the rest of the menu. But the fact is, 
the menu attempts to unify the American kitchen with honest versions of 
regional dishes from all four corners. And while the cooking at Trees is 
occasionally spotty, the food tastes mostly like you expect it to. That must 
account for its almost mystical popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Every time I've been there the place has been packed. And that says something. 
Anyone willing to pay $18.95 for crab cakes and $14.95 for a turkey dinner has 
to be considered a devotee, when like dishes can be had for modest prices at 
more humble restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
I found the selfsame crab cakes somewhat mushy, although properly flaky and 
nicely flavored. But the turkey dinner, served Sundays only, is definitely one 
to grow on. This is tender, terrific turkey, with a great, grainy corn bread 
stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
Come weekdays for various Americana specials. Mondays you can experience a 
tasty, delicate chicken-fried steak that Dolly Parton probably wouldn't touch. 
Tuesdays there is great pork loin with homemade applesauce. Again, Trees bills 
itself as an American restaurant. So by all means pass on those Oriental 
appetizers. Spring rolls taste as if they have been through a de-flavorizing 
machine. I've had better pot stickers in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
They also make a few uninspiring, un-American desserts that suffer from being 
too busy. Frozen apricot souffle in a crusty almond tuile is an exception. 
Finish with it. There is an excellent wine list, with good American wines. 
</P>
<P>
 Trees, 440 Heliotrope Drive, Corona del Mar. (714) 673-0910. Open daily from 5 
p.m. to midnight. Dinner for two (food only) $30-$60. All major cards. 
</P>
<P>
CHINESE 
</P>
<P>
Despite the proliferation of Oriental restaurants in Orange County, Chinese 
cooking here remains the most unsatisfying and rigidly compromised of the 
world's major cuisines. Seafood Paradise I and II are about the closest you'll 
come to Hong Kong around here, giant seafood emporia serving the bright-lights, 
big-city cuisine that packs the house in Monterey Park and L.A.'s Chinatown. 
They are definitely worth a visit, if you don't expect perfection. 
</P>
<P>
Seafood Paradise II is an exuberant, noise-filled room with shiny brass, florid 
chandeliers, and extras such as a fish tank stocked with lobsters, prawns and 
seasonal fish like tilapia and steelhead. Well over 50% of the restaurant's 
regulars are Oriental. 
</P>
<P>
Tables are stuck closely together, customers herded toward them like cattle. 
Service is generally friendly and helpful but the overflow makes for erratic 
attention. Waitresses scurry through the dining room with live crustaceans 
writhing in their hands, fighting through tables on their way to the kitchen. 
Waiters often seem harried and confused. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen is pure Cantonese, which means plenty of light sauces, steam 
cooking and natural flavors. There are marvelous cold dishes such as smoked 
fish, wine marinated chicken; try something called pre-salted duck that tastes 
like a tender version of Smithfield ham. You can't miss here. 
</P>
<P>
Seafood is turned out in every imaginable way -- sauteed giant clam, braised 
sea cucumber, oyster sauce abalone, kung pao frog. If Kermit doesn't tickle 
your fantasies, try a variety of shrimp, squid, scallop, crab or live fish 
preparations, but remember that when fish are freshest, the Chinese steam. MSG 
is not a dirty word here, so you'd better consult the waiter if there is a 
problem. It can easily be omitted. 
</P>
<P>
But even if you are not a seafood lover, you'll be right at home. The menu is 
crowded with duck, beef, chicken and noodle dishes. Try orange peel chicken, 
sauteed pieces lightly dusted with cornstarch, redolent of pungent flavors. 
Hong Kong steak is another delight, served sizzling on an iron plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Seafood Paradise I, 8547 Westminster Blvd., Garden Grove. (714) 895-7964. 
Seafood Paradise II, 8602 Westminster Blvd., Westminster. (714) 893-6066. Both 
are open daily from 10:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. Dinner for two (food only) $20-$40. 
Visa, MasterCard and American Express accepted. 
</P>
<P>
ITALIAN 
</P>
<P>
I've saved the best for last, because there are more good new Italian 
restaurants in Orange County than any other kind. This year alone, Viva Italia, 
Sapori, Bagatta, Baci and many others have opened. Many more are to come. 
</P>
<P>
Sorrento Grill in Laguna Beach is a high-concept, slightly yuppified 
interpretation of northern Italian cuisine, but the overall quality of the food 
they serve just cannot be denied. Walking in, you get an appetizing whiff of 
meats and fish as they grill over mesquite embers, a sensation no other Italian 
restaurant in the area offers. 
</P>
<P>
Chef Roseanne Ruiz is not Italian but she is a real creator, to my mind Orange 
County's leading woman chef. Watch Ruiz ply her trade in her stunningly 
designed open kitchen, churning out ethereal pleasures such as tuna carpaccio 
with wasabi creme fraiche, and crusty Tuscan foccacia straight from the oven. 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz buys produce from Chino Ranch in Rancho Santa Fe, and there are no better 
tasting vegetables anywhere. Her signature dish of yellow, green and ripe red 
tomatoes is not available in winter, but she has added some new items to 
console regulars. Crostini, thinly sliced sourdough broiled over mesquite, 
rubbed in garlic, drizzled with goat cheese and draped with Chino's eggplant, 
ought to keep the wolf from the door well into spring. Tagliairini with snow 
peas and pancetta sounds inspirational. Chicken saltimbocca with angel hair 
pasta and wood ear mushrooms is. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Stacey Van Hanswyk says the restaurant is now open for lunch, when you 
can expect the same ear-splitting decibel level and the same wonderful level of 
cooking you find at dinner. (Ruiz is at the helm the entire day.) A convection 
pizza oven has been added, churning out a variety of calzones and pizzas with 
daily toppings. You may never have to eat a meatball sandwich again. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorrento Grill, 370 Glenneyre St., Laguna Beach. (714) 494-8686. Open Tuesdays 
through Saturdays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., and Tuesdays through Sundays 
from 5:30 to 10. Dinner for two (food only) $35-$60. All major cards.

RANDY LEWIS: BACK TO REALITY: BOX OFFICE ROLLS ALONG WHILE REAL-LIFE TRAGEDIES

The Christmas season traditionally is a bountiful time for the movie industry, 
which lets its commercial big guns loose after the fall season of thoughtful, 
artsy films (you know, all those Important ones that get the Academy Award 
nominations). 
</P>
<P>
But, while spending a couple of hours in the dark watching Michael J. Fox on a 
skateboard may help ease the tension from the car wars in the neighborhood mall 
parking lot, I wonder what we are really getting in exchange for our $6.50 at 
the ticket window. 
</P>
<P>
This question goes through my mind as I see someone standing at the roadside 
with a sign that says "I will work for food" -- and then read a story like the 
recent one about Sony paying somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion to 
Warner Bros. to get two (count 'em, two) hotshot movie producers for its new 
subsidiary, Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Are these things related? Yes, even if indirectly. Thanks to super-hits like 
"Batman" and "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," the industry is reporting a record 
year at the box office, in excess of $4 billion worth of ticket stubs. Because 
the movie-going public is increasingly willing to spend, spend, spend, studios 
have no qualms about writing checks for ever-staggering sums in pursuit of the 
cinematic golden egg. 
</P>
<P>
Universal Pictures simultaneously filmed two sequels to "Back to the Future," 
which has grossed something like $400 million to date, and they consider it a 
money-saving stroke of genius because the pair cost only $80 million. By the 
same reasoning, Sony views producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber as a steal at 
half a billion dollars because they were responsible for such blockbusters as 
"Batman" and "Rain Man." 
</P>
<P>
And the question arises: 
</P>
<P>
What can a couple of movie producers do that Sony is willing cough up something 
like 2,500 times what the President is paid, regardless of whether you happen 
to like Bush. 
</P>
<P>
They are not enlightening the populace. They are not spreading peace. They are 
not alleviating hunger or homelessness. They are, however, keeping the masses 
entertained. And because their diversions have reaped millions in profits, Sony 
wants them. Badly. 
</P>
<P>
In his excellent recent PBS series "The Public Mind," Bill Moyers pointedly and 
distressingly demonstrated how image and entertainment, not truth or concern 
for the human race, are ever more shaping our society. 
</P>
<P>
If we weren't so busy entertaining ourselves blind with $250 million worth of 
"Batman" tickets, could we perhaps find ways to spend our money on something a 
little more worthwhile? 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to look farther than our own back yard to find plenty of people 
who are in need of things far more basic than an entertaining night at the 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
But we don't have to worry about disturbing issues like those as long as we 
continue to be more enchanted with figuring out which film is the No. 1 hit, 
who is the No. 1 box-office attraction, etc., etc. 
</P>
<P>
"If we put the same emphasis on who's the No. 1 physicist or who's the No. 1 
English major, we'd probably have a lot better society," said Jeff Rocke, 
communications director for the United Way of Orange County. The local chapter 
has collected a little more than $12.9 million to distribute among more than 
800 charitable groups in Orange County during 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, that pitiable sum wouldn't buy gas for the Batmobile. 
</P>
<P>
"$500 million" -- the amount paid to Guber and Peters -- "comes fairly close to 
what our total expenditures are for a year," says Bob Griffith, chief deputy 
director for the Orange County Social Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some activities that we know need to be done, which aren't able to do 
with the funding we have," Griffith said. "If we had $500 million fall into our 
lap, we'd be able to lower the caseload level in our (social) workers' laps. In 
the child-abuse area, a typical worker handles 75 cases a month. There's just 
not enough time to take care of the kinds of problems that these kids have. If 
we could reduce those caseloads, we figure we could have more success not only 
in saving lives, but in turning lives around." 
</P>
<P>
I know -- let's lighten their load by sending them to "Christmas Vacation." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "we don't have a good adult-abuse system to take care of senior 
citizens, who are quite often abused by their caretakers, whether that is 
family or whoever," Griffith continued. "The same things we find in child abuse 
situations is happening to older people who are dependent on others for care. 
Anywhere in the state we don't have a good system for services to those 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Gee, I wonder what time "Look Who's Talking" plays tonight? 
</P>
<P>
United Way recently compiled a "Needs Assessment for Orange County" study that 
identifies the most pressing needs in the community, in no particular order, as 
homelessness, child care, physical and sexual abuse, literacy, mental and 
emotional health, health care and substance abuse. Rocke cited some alarming 
statistics: 
</P>
<P>
* The county's homeless population ranges from 4,000 to 10,000, according to 
Orange County's Homeless Issues Task Force, which notes that "there are only 
about 600 shelter beds in the county." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like a lot of people with nowhere to go but to the movies! 
</P>
<P>
* An estimated 200,000 adults in O.C. are illiterate, according to the American 
Library Assn. of Orange County. Nationally, the cost of welfare and 
unemployment compensation to people who are unable to work because of 
illiteracy is $6 billion annually, according to a 1989 study by United Way of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
But who needs to read when you can go to the movies! 
</P>
<P>
* According to a study conducted by the Orange County Health Care Agency, 
"mental-health services are underfunded by more than $2.5 million annually, 
while increasing demands for services threaten to overwhelm residential care 
facilities, services for emotionally disturbed children and in-patient 
services." 
</P>
<P>
Feeling down? Try "The Little Mermaid"! 
</P>
<P>
The list goes on but the story remains the same. According to Rocke, officials 
at various agencies trying to remedy these problems report that demand for 
their services is going up, and not just a little, but an average of 60% to 
70%. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody says we should divert all money that goes into entertainment toward 
remedying this country's social ills. But maybe just once this holiday season, 
each of us could skip a movie, and instead of giving the bucks to a business 
that exists to let people ignore, send them to an agency that tries to help 
people survive.

REPORT CARDS ON HIGH SCHOOLS ISSUED BY STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's report-card time for Orange County's public high schools. 
</P>
<P>
But educators caution against reading too much into the information released on 
each high school last week by the California Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
In today's Section U, a special report gives school-by-school reports and 
examines Newport Harbor High School, which posted the county's highest overall 
score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
Experts also discuss the value of the SAT, which is often used by college 
placement officials and is the target of critics who say it is biased against 
women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
For a look at the week ahead, Your Week appears today in Section U. The weekly 
chess column is also there.

MOTHER LOSES SON BEHIND WALL OF ADOPTION; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY: AFTER A FLORIDA WOMAN FINALLY FOUND THE CHILD SHE HADN'T SEEN SINCE 
1980, HIS ADOPTIVE PARENTS REFUSED TO LET HER VISIT HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This couldn't be happening, Kim Roberson thought. It's not possible to lose a 
child twice. 
</P>
<P>
But that is exactly what happened. 
</P>
<P>
The Florida woman's 3-year-old son, Leroy, disappeared in 1980, when his father 
took the boy for a custody visit and never returned. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years later, she tracked Leroy down. He had been adopted by an Orange 
County couple who opposed her having any contact with the boy. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't ask to take him back -- she knew she probably had no chance to 
regain custody -- but she began a court fight simply for the right to see her 
son again. 
</P>
<P>
In July, she lost that battle. 
</P>
<P>
It was very simple, she was told. Leroy belongs to someone else now. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it," Roberson, 29, said from her home near Orlando, Fla., 
where she lives today with only memories of her son. "I wanted to go through 
the floor. I said, 'That's it? It's over? I can never see my son?' There's only 
so much a person can take before they break." 
</P>
<P>
Roberson had always held out hope that she could hug her son again. But 
instead, she has to settle for a sheet of paper outlining the barest of details 
about the boy, who is now 12. 
</P>
<P>
More than a year ago, in a letter to the attorney for Leroy's adoptive parents, 
she had asked if they could tell her what her son is like. The response came 
back through the lawyer, an emotionless recitation of answers to her questions, 
numbered neatly on a page. 
</P>
<P>
"It said things like: 'Five feet tall. Blond hair. Grades are good. Has a lot 
of friends. Has a girlfriend. Goes to church. Favorite movie star is Michael J. 
Fox,"' Roberson said. 
</P>
<P>
Leroy's mother felt as though she held the tiniest bit of her son in her hand. 
It was a strange mix of gratitude and yearning. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Roberson is $30,000 in debt from the lawsuit, has two more children to 
rear and cannot afford an appeal. Divorced from her second husband and waiting 
tables to make ends meet, she has resigned herself to questions: What is her 
first born son like? What's his favorite flavor of ice cream? What does his 
laugh sound like? 
</P>
<P>
"I just want him to know his mother didn't run off and leave him," she said. 
"He was taken from me. I birthed that child. I was with him through his 
teething. I potty-trained him. I watched while he learned to walk and talk and 
all of a sudden he's gone and it's as if he never existed. Well, that child 
didn't die. He's still in my heart." 
</P>
<P>
Roberson's story is one of loss, but it's also about an ironic and painful 
solution to an unsolveable problem. The chief mission of family-law courts is 
to create stable, loving environments for children. But that can mean their 
natural parents never see them again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buying Presents 
</P>
<P>
For several years after Leroy disappeared, his mother kept buying him birthday 
and Christmas presents. She imagined him bouncing into the room and tearing 
them open as if he'd never been gone. 
</P>
<P>
But the brightly wrapped gifts stacked up, unopened. In her mind, Roberson kept 
flashing on the last time she saw her son: leaving their Nashville home for a 
court-ordered custody visit with his father, Larry Rose, on Oct. 17, 1980. They 
never returned. 
</P>
<P>
Roberson drove to St. Petersburg, Fla., her ex-husband's last address, but he 
had cleared out of his apartment. For two weeks, she scoured his job site, 
local parks and neighborhoods. No sign of her ex-husband or her son. The police 
and her lawyer said they couldn't help her. Finally, in tears, she gave up. 
</P>
<P>
Six years later, she remarried and moved to Florida. Buoyed by her new 
husband's support and dogged by the memory of her son, Roberson renewed the 
quest for her boy. With the help of missing children's organizations, she 
discovered in the fall of 1987 that Leroy had been adopted by an Orange County 
couple. In Orange County Superior Court, she filed suit against the boy's 
adoptive parents in a bid to see or write to her son. She also named the 
county, claiming county investigators didn't try hard enough to find her. 
</P>
<P>
But the county steadfastly refused to disclose her son's whereabouts. Its 
lawyers said the county met its obligations by conducting an extensive search 
for Roberson. And once an adoption is final, walls of secrecy protect the 
stability of the child's new family unit. A judge agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Court records show that Leroy was first taken into Orange County custody 
briefly in July 1982 after a severe spanking by Rose, a carpenter who had a 
history of skirmishes with the law. That December, Rose gave his son to county 
social workers for good, saying he couldn't control the boy and was afraid he 
might hurt him if they stayed together. 
</P>
<P>
Leroy's father told social workers that his wife left the boy with him in 1980 
and never got back in touch, a claim Roberson angrily denies. By April, 1983, 
the father had disappeared and Leroy was in a foster home. In February, 1985, 
Roberson's parental rights were terminated in her absence. Leroy was adopted. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys defending the county against Roberson's lawsuit located Rose in 1989 
and talked with him, but they will not disclose his whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
Roberson's attorney, Jeffrey W. Doeringer, said he still gets choked up when he 
thinks about the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Kim never wanted to take the child away from his new parents," he said. "She 
only wanted to visit or write or share in the child's life. She believed she 
had something to share with him. She wanted to make sure he knew she hadn't 
abandoned him, but that the system lost track of her and then got between them 
when she finally did find him." 
</P>
<P>
In court papers, Doeringer accused the county of failing to follow up a 
critical piece of data that could have led to Roberson: her divorce lawyer's 
name. It was listed on the divorce certificate that county investigators 
obtained in Tennessee in their bid to locate her. 
</P>
<P>
"You were so close!" Doeringer thought. "Why did you stop there?" But county 
attorneys defended the Social Services Agency and Probation Department, ticking 
off all the things their investigators did in searching for Roberson in several 
states: They checked property and tax records, scoured police, sheriffs' and 
postmasters' files, contacted the FBI and motor vehicle departments, leafed 
through phone books. The few leads they got turned into dead ends. Their 
certified letters came back marked undeliverable. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very hard case" emotionally, said Daniel T. Carreon, the attorney who 
defended the county. "I'm a human being. I have eight children myself, so I can 
understand that the loss of a child would create anguish for any parent. But 
the court made the correct decision. The county fulfilled its duty. It made an 
extraordinary effort to find her." 
</P>
<P>
"All the pain I've been through, just wondering if he was dead or alive," 
Roberson said. "I can understand (his adoptive parents') want to protect him, 
but how can you protect a child from his own mother when she's not even out to 
hurt him? They've only heard one side of the story (from Rose) and they've 
never given me a chance." 
</P>
<P>
One time, the adoptive mother telephoned the birth mother. But the call was 
painful. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'What the hell do you want?' Those were her exact words," Roberson 
said. "She said, 'Get the hell out of his life.' " 
</P>
<P>
Roberson still hopes Leroy's new parents will tell him about her some day and 
that she might get to see her son. In the meantime, she works the 
breakfast-and-lunch shift at a small-town Florida restaurant and spends time 
with her other two children. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think about him all the time," Roberson said. "Little things get to me 
every day. His birthday really gets me every year. Just typical questions from 
people get to me, like how many children do I have. Well, I have three. 
</P>
<P>
"And they ask, 'Are your kids all ready for Christmas?' And I think to myself, 
'Well, two are.' I sure wish I knew about the third."

SNOW MACHINES TURN PARK INTO 1-DAY WINTER WONDERLAND

Carolyn Corbett, 8, was not really dressed for a day on the slopes. 
</P>
<P>
She had just finished a morning game with the Pink Lightning youth soccer team 
and was still wearing her pink jersey and gray shorts. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, she wasn't shy about sliding down the mound of snow that the city 
of Costa Mesa and a local realty firm had carted to Estancia Park on Saturday, 
to the delight of about 2,000 children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
"You can fall over and get sopping and it cools you off if you just ran a long 
way," Carolyn said. 
</P>
<P>
The park was transformed into a temporary winter wonderland with the help of 
machines that turned large blocks of ice into 55 tons of snow. 
</P>
<P>
"How many people have a chance to get up to Big Bear or anywhere else to see 
snow? So we just bring it to them," said Chuck Carr, recreation superintendent 
for the city. The city co-sponsored the event with Torelli Realty. 
</P>
<P>
"For a lot of people, just coming down that hill is the first time they've ever 
been in the snow," said Sarah Kline, who grew up in Connecticut. "This is 
showing my son what snow is all about." 
</P>
<P>
Kline, a Huntington Beach resident, brought her son, Grady, 2, and daughter 
Bridget, 9 months, to see the snow. 
</P>
<P>
"They're excited big time," Kline's neighbor, Kathi Domenici, said of her two 
daughters, Jessica, 7, and Mallory, 4, who were bundled up in snowsuits with 
shorts underneath in case it grew too warm. 
</P>
<P>
Kline captured Jessica and Mallory on videotape as they flew down the hill on a 
blue plastic sled. 
</P>
<P>
"I like going fast a lot," Mallory said. 
</P>
<P>
Children weren't the only ones to take advantage of the sled runs. Mary Ann 
Hunter of Costa Mesa, who brought three of her sons, took a ride herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved it. It scared me to death," Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
For one of her sons, Dylan, 2, the scariest part of the day was Santa Claus. 
While another son, Daniel, 7, avoided Santa's lap because his friends from 
school were there, and Nathan, 4, climbed up and chatted a while, Dylan just 
howled. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a real shy guy," his mom said. 
</P>
<P>
Along with visiting Santa Claus, children took hayrides and pony rides and rode 
sleds. They made Christmas crafts and threw snowballs in a separate play area. 
The play area was a new addition to the annual event. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are kids. When you see snow, the first thing they've got to do is pick it 
up and throw it," Carr said. Snowball-throwing was not allowed on the sled 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
After the children were done, firefighters hooked a hose to a fire hydrant 
across the street from the park and sprayed down the hill, melting the snow.

300 ACTIVISTS SQUARE OFF ON ABORTION IN FULLERTON; 
</P>
<P>
DEMONSTRATION: EACH SIDE CLAIMS VICTORY IN RALLIES STAGED AT MORE THAN 20 
CLINICS THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTIES.

<P>
Hundreds of anti-abortion and pro-choice advocates staged side-by-side rallies 
at a women's clinic Saturday, culminating a morning of protests and 
counter-protests at more than 20 clinics throughout Los Angeles and Orange 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
Police estimated the crowd at about 300 and said it was equally divided between 
abortion-rights activists and Operation Rescue abortion opponents. But each 
camp estimated its own group at several hundred more than that. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice advocates rallied in front of the Women's Center on Orangethorpe 
Avenue singing, "Joy to the world, choice has come" and other modified 
Christmas carols. Nearby, anti-abortion protesters sat and sometimes kneeled in 
entrance ways as they prayed and sang hymns. There were no arrests or reports 
of violence. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, anti-abortion activists had skipped from clinic to clinic, trying to 
elude pro-choice advocates, who were tracking them throughout the morning. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides claimed victory at rallies that began shortly after noon. 
</P>
<P>
"Our numbers are growing and growing and growing," said Ellie Smeal, president 
of the Fund for the Feminist Majority, a national abortion-rights group based 
in Los Angeles. A crowd that sported blue pro-choice buttons, signs and 
T-shirts cheered her remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to make this a pro-choice assembly and a pro-choice 
governor's mansion," said Smeal, past president of the National Organization 
for Women. Moments later, former San Francisco Mayor Diane Feinstein, a 
candidate in the governor's race, came to the makeshift podium. 
</P>
<P>
"We will stand shoulder to shoulder until we have our right to protect our 
reproductive freedom," Feinstein said. The Roe vs. Wade decision by the Supreme 
Court established the legality of abortions in 1973. But in the court's 
decision in the Webster case earlier this year, which gave states broader 
powers, the abortion issue "was thrown to a political arena and the vagrancies 
of state legislatures, which are all controlled by men," she said. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 feet away and a short while later, Russ Neal, director of the Southern 
California Operation Rescue, addressed his followers, who carried graphic 
posters and signs reading "Stop Killing Babies," as well as prayer books and 
Bibles. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a very successful rescue," Neal said. "We have heard that they had a 
full schedule of abortions today, and we got here before they opened and before 
those children who would have been killed were killed." 
</P>
<P>
Pro-choice and Operation Rescue forces gave conflicting accounts of whether the 
demonstration had affected the day's business at the Fullerton clinic. Owners 
of the clinic could not be reached for comment. Kathy Spillar, national 
coordinator for the Fund for the Feminist Majority, said the clinic had planned 
to remain closed Saturday and that no abortions had been scheduled at the 
clinic, which offers a variety of health services, most of which do not pertain 
to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
But Carla Black, a member of Operation Rescue who described herself as a 
counselor, said that she had persuaded one pregnant woman on her way to the 
clinic to reconsider her plans for an abortion. Black said the woman was taken 
by other Operation Rescue workers to the Crisis Pregnancy Center, which she 
said was an anti-abortion center that helps pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
The day began early for both anti-abortion and pro-choice activists. Spillar 
said more than 500 pro-choice activists had been dispatched by 5 a.m. to 26 
clinics throughout Los Angeles and Orange counties that had been considered 
potential targets of Operation Rescue. The anti-abortion group had earlier 
announced it was planning a "rescue" -- during which members try to form 
blockades and keep clinics from opening -- but, as in the past, Operation 
Rescue leaders kept secret the precise targets until early Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Before converging in Fullerton, Operation Rescue sent forces to clinics in El 
Monte, Long Beach and Tustin. Pro-choice activists said patients were scheduled 
for early morning appointments and thus managed to avoid protesters at the 
Doctor's Family Planning Clinic on Irvine Boulevard in Tustin. The patients 
were inside before 8 a.m., while Operation Rescue workers did not arrive until 
about half an hour later. In Long Beach, patients were also treated as 
scheduled, pro-choice activists said. They added that the El Monte clinic was 
not scheduled to open Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
By 9 a.m., most of the day's activities were focused in Fullerton, where 
pro-choice and anti-abortion activists staged rallies and then lingered until 
later in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always fearful people won't cross over the Orange curtain, but Los Angeles 
and Orange County coalesced today in big numbers," said Barbara Jackson, a 
member of the Pro-Choice Coalition of Orange County. "Pro-choice people are 
going to support women's rights anywhere in the country, even Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations were less peaceful in Brookline, Mass., where 60 Operation 
Rescue activists were arrested for blocking patients from entering the Repro 
Associates clinic. Authorities videotaped the anti-abortion protesters and said 
they would use the tapes in a pending civil suit against Operation Rescue. The 
anti-abortion group has been charged under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt 
Organization law by Brookline officials, who hope to recoup overtime costs for 
police assigned to maintain order at the protests.

MIKE PENNER: A SEASON OF RALLIES STARTED WITH FUMBLE

<P>
Stalag 49, as the San Francisco 49ers' training facility is affectionately 
known, was sealed off from Los Angeles reporters this week, ostensibly because 
of all the "secret stuff" Coach George Seifert has added to the playbook for 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
To the Rams, this should be construed as positive news. The last time the 49ers 
put in a new play against the Rams, it cost San Francisco the game. 
</P>
<P>
They call it the Tom Rathman fumble. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, the 49ers insist Rathman was the right man for the job late in the 
afternoon of Oct. 1 at Candlestick Park. San Francisco had the football, a 
12-10 lead and first down on the Ram 20 with three minutes left in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The assignment: Three careful plunges through the middle of the line and a 
chip-shot field goal to wrap it up. 
</P>
<P>
The assignee: In the 49er huddle, no one had to ask. This was a Tom Rathman 
moment. The fourth-year fullback from Nebraska hadn't fumbled a thing -- 
football, car keys or punch line -- since the fall of '87. His were the surest 
hands in the house, the safest bets in the San Francisco offense. 
</P>
<P>
Even Joe Montana bobbles a center snap now and then. 
</P>
<P>
So Rathman gets the call, and the ball, and what does he do? 
</P>
<P>
He leaves a deposit on the 19-yard line and Ram linebacker Kevin Greene 
collects. 
</P>
<P>
Two minutes and 57 seconds later, Mike Lansford kicks a 26-yard field goal and 
the Rams have a 13-12 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, the ramifications are still being felt much to the delight of 
the Rams and ABC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
If Rathman holds onto the ball, the 49ers are 12-1 instead of 11-2 and the Rams 
are 8-5 instead of 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
If Rathman holds onto the ball, the 49ers are already NFC West champions and 
the Rams are left to fight for wild-card scraps. 
</P>
<P>
If Rathman holds onto the ball, America is tuning into "Major Dad" on Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"And if ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we'd have Christmas all year long," 
Rathman says, husking a little more corn. 
</P>
<P>
Rathman doesn't need to be reminded of his error or any of its consequences. 
When you've fumbled twice in your professional career, you tend to remember the 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a cutback play," Rathman says. "What I do is take the ball, cut back 
and try to read the defense. I try to get through any hole I can find. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of off-balance, leaning forward. I thought I had the ball tucked 
away, but somebody poked a hand in there and knocked it out." 
</P>
<P>
And before most of the players on the field could believe their eyes -- the 
ball was loose on the ground for a couple of frozen seconds -- Greene finally 
acted first and pounced on the ball. 
</P>
<P>
The scoreboard clock read 2:59. Jim Everett, no threat yet to Montana's mastery 
of the two-minute drill, took over at the 19 and drove the Rams into victory 
range. With two seconds remaining, Lansford delivered. 
</P>
<P>
For the Rams, a precedent had been set. Everett would follow with four more 
drives of similar stature, leading his team to last-minute scores against 
Buffalo, Minnesota, New Orleans and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
If not for defensive collapses against the Bills and Vikings, Everett would 
stand 4-0 in such rescue missions. As it is, Everett salvaged two of those 
games, enough to give the Rams a jolt of moxie as they head into Round II with 
the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
But the first San Francisco game was the ice-breaker and, for that, the Rams, 
in large part, can thank Rathman. The ice man cometh. 
</P>
<P>
"I put a lot of the blame for that loss on myself," Rathman said. "And I should 
have. I take a lot of pride on getting the ball and not fumbling in that 
situation. Those are my situations." 
</P>
<P>
Monday represents an opportunity for redemption, but Rathman contends he isn't 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really concerned about the fumble," he said. "If I fumbled all the 
time, then I'd be thinking about it. But when I've been put in that type of 
situation the past few years, I've been pretty dependable . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This game is for a lot of the marbles -- the division championship and the 
home-field advantage (in the playoffs). So I can't worry about what happened 
last game. Those things happen. All I can do is watch films and try to see how 
I could have made a difference." 
</P>
<P>
The sad twist for Rathman is that his gravest mistake as a 49er has come during 
his finest season as a 49er. After 13 games, Rathman leads all NFL running 
backs with 66 receptions, a statistic that indicates restored faith in his 
sure-handedness. With 267 rushing yards and 548 receiving yards, Rathman 
already has set a personal best in single-season total offense. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, until San Francisco clinches the division title, Rathman will be 
remembered for the turnover that turned the Rams around. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-six basic. That was the play Montana called on Oct. 1, the play that 
sent Rathman between right guard and right tackle and into the hands of the Ram 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
It still exists in the 49er playbook. But as Rathman will tell you, it isn't 
always all that basic.

TITANS MAKE IT LOOK TOO EASY IN VICTORY

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton was looking forward to a test Saturday -- and to the 
attention that would come with passing it. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans came into their game against Tulsa unbeaten after three games, but 
without having played any impressive teams. 
</P>
<P>
Tulsa, they believed, would give them a chance to grab a little limelight. 
Instead, the Titans came away with another runaway victory, 84-58, too easy to 
be impressive. 
</P>
<P>
After four games, the Titans' closest margin of victory is 15 points. The first 
test, presumably, is still to come. 
</P>
<P>
Tulsa (2-2) didn't cooperate much. After challenging Fullerton with physical 
play and tough offensive rebounding in the first half, the Golden Hurricane 
turned innocuous in the second half with a dreadful shooting performance. 
</P>
<P>
Tulsa made only one field goal in the first 15 minutes of the second half and 
finished only six of 30 for the half. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a good effort tonight as a team, but we shot poorly," said Tulsa Coach 
J.D. Barnett. The Golden Hurricane made only 16 of 57 field goals in the game, 
a 28% performance. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Coach John Sneed praised his team's match-up zone defense. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had a 41-31 lead at halftime on the strength of 20 first-half points 
by Mark Hill, who finished with a season-high 27. 
</P>
<P>
But Tulsa's cold spell did in the Golden Hurricane, and Fullerton's 10-point 
halftime lead grew by leaps and bounds. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Cornal Henderson made the team's second field goal of the second 
half with 4:35 remaining, Fullerton led, 69-46. 
</P>
<P>
People might have been more impressed if the margin of victory had been 
smaller. The Titans made it look too easy. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that was the toughest ballgame we've played so far," Sneed said. "I 
thought we had a chance to make a statement against a pretty good ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans' 4-0 start is their best since the 1983-84 season when they began 
5-0. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton will have an opportunity to match that start next Saturday when it 
plays Cal State Northridge at home. 
</P>
<P>
The next test probably will come against Colorado State in Fort Collins, Colo., 
on Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
In games against West Texas State and St. Mary's, Fullerton had held only 
three-point leads at halftime, but went on to win by at least 15. 
</P>
<P>
But against Tulsa, the best team the Titans have faced so far, Fullerton took a 
10-point lead at halftime even though Cedric Ceballos scored only four points 
and had to sit out the final seven minutes with three fouls. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos came back to start the second half. After a Tulsa basket, he helped 
spark a 10-0 run that put Fullerton ahead, 51-33, in the first five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
With Fullerton ahead by 14, Ceballos put the first markings of a blowout on the 
game when he took a no-look pass from Wayne Williams on the break for a flying 
dunk. 
</P>
<P>
He worked inside for a short bank shot on the next possession, and the Titans 
led by 18. The lead was never smaller than 16 again. 
</P>
<P>
Tulsa, whose only other loss was to Southwest Missouri State, a team that made 
the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament last season, was led by Wafe 
Jenkins' 14 points and Henderson's 11. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the margin of victory, the Titan starters played well into the late 
going. The first starter to leave the game for good was Agee Ward, who fouled 
out with 2:59 left. Ceballos didn't leave until only 2:11 remained. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a game in which the backups played substantially. Only two Fullerton 
players -- Williams and Hill -- played more than 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Dareck Crane scored six points in seven minutes and had a steal, and 
David Moody played 14 minutes, scoring five points. 
</P>
<P>
"Our depth is a nice change from last season," Sneed said. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton still isn't set on a lineup. Against Tulsa, freshman Aaron Wilhite 
got the first start of his career, replacing senior John Sykes at center. There 
might yet be more jockeying at that position -- Sykes played 25 minutes to 
Wilhite's 15. "(Wilhite) has been playing well," Coach John Sneed said. "That's 
where you win a starting job, in practice. I gave him a look. Maybe it will 
wake Sykes up." Sykes was averaging four points and five rebounds a game. . . . 
The last suspense in the game was to see when Tom Parada, the 5-foot-6 freshman 
walk-on, would get in the game. Sneed makes little secret of the fact that he 
kept Parada in part to become a crowd favorite, as Parada did instantly. But 
after Parada committed four turnovers in four minutes in the Titans' first game 
of the season, Sneed's enthusiasm cooled. But Parada got into the second home 
game with one minute left, and didn't enter the game against Tulsa until 31 
seconds remained. . . . Wayne Williams had 11 assists, giving him an average of 
10.5 a game. Williams also had three steals. . . . Cedric Ceballos had 12 
rebounds and 21 points, marking his third double-double in four games.

Robert Conlisk's 23 points led Los Alamitos High School to an 82-67 victory 
over league rival El Dorado for the championship in the Trabuco Hills 
basketball tournament Saturday at Trabuco Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
Conlisk, who made 10 of 14 shots from the field, was named the tournament's 
most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids played real hard and we were more intense," Los Alamitos Coach Steve 
Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were patient on offense, we executed and got the good shots, and our 
defense limited El Dorado's shots." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Los Alamitos, leading by six at the end of the first quarter, 
outscored El Dorado 24-17 in the second quarter and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos' Steve Sargeant, who scored 18 points, made the all-tournament 
team, as did El Dorado's Mike Bradich. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos is 4-0; El Dorado is 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills 67, Mission Viejo 64 -- Trabuco Hills, which took an early 8-0 
lead and never trailed, contained a Mission Viejo fourth-quarter rally for 
third place. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Cramer's field goal with one minute remaining brought Mission Viejo to 
within, 61-60, but six consecutive free throws by Trabuco Hills ensured the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo Coach Bob Minier said his team lacked focus in the first half, 
but got aggressive in the second half. Cramer was the rallying force, scoring 
all 22 of his points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Beau Hossler and Randy Kriech paced Trabuco Hills with 24 and 15 points, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal was to hold (Hossler and Kriech) to 30, it would have made a 
difference," Minier said. 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Hills is 3-3, Mission Viejo is 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
University 76, Fullerton 73 -- Brian Smith's 27 points led University for 
seventh place. Fullerton's Rene Arias scored 14 of his 25 points in the fourth 
quarter. Four of his five field goals in the last quarter were three-pointers, 
but it wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill 68, Rancho Buena Vista 57 -- Mark Wilkinson's 27 points led Foothill 
(2-3) to fifth place. BOB BORSUM

DEFENSE: BUDGET CUTS AND IMPROVING EAST-WEST RELATIONS MEAN BELT-TIGHTENING FOR 
SEVERAL ORANGE COUNTY FIRMS INVOLVED IN THE CONTROVERSIAL STRATEGIC DEFENSE 
INITIATIVE.

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In late November, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. Vice President Daniel 
Green dashed off to Washington after learning that a "Star Wars" program 
potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars to his firm might be shot 
down by the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
Green's mission: to persuade Pentagon bigwigs that a ground-launched missile 
program known in Star Wars jargon as the High Endoatmospheric Defense 
Interceptor, or HEDI, was worth saving. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas won a partial victory. Although the program's budget will be 
slashed next year, company officials say the Pentagon has assured them that 
enough money will remain to perform critical flight tests. Even so, Space 
Systems of Huntington Beach will have to cut its HEDI staffing by about 60 jobs 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"We ended up with the next-to-the-bottom thing on our list," said Green, the 
company's general manager of strategic systems. "The bottom was termination." 
</P>
<P>
At least seven Orange County companies have won contracts worth several hundred 
million dollars since the controversial missile defense program, formally known 
as the Strategic Defense Initiative, was launched by President Ronald Reagan in 
1983. By far the largest share of that money has gone to McDonnell Douglas and 
Rockwell International Corp., two of the nation's biggest Star Wars 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Local companies that do SDI work already are making adjustments for a major 
change in the year ahead: stingier budgets. In November, President Bush signed 
a $286-billion defense spending bill that included $3.8 billion for SDI for 
fiscal year 1990, which began Oct. 1. That amount is $1.1 billion less than the 
administration had originally sought for the program and marks the first budget 
reduction in the program's history. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, SDI may face additional big cuts in funding over the next several 
years as part of a major reassessment of Pentagon spending in light of arms 
control negotiations, the warming U.S.-Soviet relations and the sweeping 
political and economic changes taking place in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Star Wars' ' political fortunes are directly related to the state of 
Soviet-American relations," said John E. Pike, a space policy analyst for the 
Federation of American Scientists in Washington. "Over the past six years, 
Soviet-American relations have grown progressively better, and the future of 
'Star Wars' has become more uncertain." 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the Bush Administration has significantly scaled back its 
official expectations for the program. Originally proposed by Reagan as an 
impenetrable shield of space-based defenses, administration officials now 
acknowledge that SDI would offer only partial protection against incoming 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
An informal survey of local companies involved in SDI work found that most are 
anticipating cuts or cancellations for their programs. A few programs, however, 
will grow in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Large contractors such as McDonnell Douglas and Rockwell will not suffer too 
badly even should the major programs be scrubbed. SDI contracts comprise only a 
small fraction of their overall businesses. But smaller firms that count on SDI 
work for a major share of their sales will be affected severely. 
</P>
<P>
"The outlook is not too good," said Mitch Thomas, president of L'Garde Inc., a 
small Tustin aerospace firm that relies on "Star Wars" contracts for 60% of its 
business. In anticipation of cuts in the SDI program, L'Garde began laying off 
workers last year, trimming the staff from a peak of 55 people to 37. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone said that as soon as Reagan went out of office, the program was going 
to take some cuts," Thomas said. L'Garde, which specializes in inflatable space 
devices and electronic systems, is scrambling for non-SDI contracts from the 
Pentagon or from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, although, 
he said, both organizations' budgets "are not in the best of shape." 
</P>
<P>
Another local company concerned about program cuts is SRS Technologies, a 
Newport Beach aerospace research and engineering firm that has slices of eight 
SDI programs and had contracts totaling $8 million for them in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
SRS Technologies thrived during the "Star Wars" era, with sales soaring from 
$6.3 million in fiscal 1983 to $40 million in the year that ended Aug. 31. SDI 
contracts comprise 20% of the firm's sales. 
</P>
<P>
Mohindar S. Sandhu, SRS Technologies president, said SDI cuts are threatening 
several contracts worth several million dollars a year. One contract likely to 
be canceled involves development of an X-ray radar device to distinguish real 
nuclear bombs from decoy targets in space. That contract was worth $800,000 to 
the company last year alone. 
</P>
<P>
But there may be a silver lining in the cloud. SRS hopes to adapt the X-ray 
technology for medical and other defense applications. The technology could 
potentially be used to improve the techniques for administering radiation 
treatment to cancer patients. Another possibility is to use X-ray technology to 
monitor compliance with arms-control treaties. 
</P>
<P>
Sandhu said he understands that the scaling back of the "Star Wars" program is 
being driven at least in part by the changes on the international scene, 
especially in the easing of East-West tensions. 
</P>
<P>
He says he is concerned, however, "that the powers that be might go overboard 
in the cuts. . . . It's not certain what's going to happen in Russia. Someone 
could come around and knock off (Soviet leader Mikhail S.) Gorbachev, and the 
Soviet Union might go back to its previous ways." 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Space Systems in Huntington Beach is the prime contractor for 
several key SDI programs. The company has received more than $300 million to 
develop the HEDI missile interceptor, a kinetic-energy weapon that would 
destroy enemy warheads during the final phase of their flight by slamming into 
them with projectiles at extremely high speeds. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas has sought $100 million for HEDI for the fiscal year that 
began in October. Although the company has not received formal word from the 
Pentagon, the amount will probably be slashed to between $65 million and $70 
million, said Green, who is the company's marketing manager for SDI programs. 
</P>
<P>
The budget reductions will force the Army to stretch out work on the HEDI 
program. The first in a series of flight tests is scheduled for early next year 
at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico., but subsequent tests will be 
delayed by about a year. 
</P>
<P>
Pike, of the Federation of American Scientists, says HEDI could face a troubled 
future because it is "a big, expensive, long-term program that doesn't fit 
into" the Pentagon's plans for deploying the first phase of "Star Wars" around 
the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell has built a $30-million Strategic Defense Center in Seal Beach for the 
purpose of administering its SDI contracts and conducting research and 
development. The company had SDI contracts totaling $778 million in 1988. More 
current figures were unavailable from the company. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell, which is based in El Segundo, is the prime contractor on the 
Space-Based Interceptor program, a collection of low-flying satellites that 
would fire high-energy projectiles known as "smart rocks" at missiles, 
destroying them on impact. 
</P>
<P>
However, experts see the space-based segments of the SDI program as 
particularly vulnerable to budget cuts. Rockwell officials declined requests 
for interviews about the company's SDI programs. 
</P>
<P>
Another program SDI watchers say may be in jeopardy is TRW Inc.'s laser 
development program. TRW maintains a test site for the laser project at its 
2,000-acre research facility near San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Under a $250-million contract with the government, TRW uses the site to test an 
antimissile weapon known as the Alpha, a potent chemical laser, for use in the 
SDI program. 
</P>
<P>
The laser program, now in the early stages of development, calls for the weapon 
to be installed on a space-based platform to test its abilities to both detect 
and destroy incoming missiles armed with nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
The Alpha laser was originally scheduled to be sent into space as part of an 
experiment known as Zenith Star in 1994. But a Pentagon spokesman said the 
flight test date has been pushed back to the mid- to late 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The Alpha laser has been one of the most disputed parts of the "Star Wars" 
program, as experts have argued over whether its operation in space would 
violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. 
</P>
<P>
According to Pike, the laser program is also vulnerable to cancellation because 
of its high cost and doubts about whether it is technically feasible. The 
program "may have gone off into Never-Never Land," he said. 
</P>
<P>
TRW spokeswoman Montye C. Male said: "To date, we have not been told the 
program is going to be cut." 
</P>
<P>
The news for local SDI contractors is not all gloomy, though. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Space Systems unit expects to cut its HEDI program staff by 30%, 
or 60 positions, another SDI program will increase by 100 employees next year, 
McDonnell Douglas said. That program -- a ground-based surveillance and 
tracking system -- involves developing sophisticated sensors, or "eyes in 
space," that would be launched upon attack to track incoming nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas expects to receive about $50 million for the sensor program 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
And officials at the Hughes Aircraft Ground Systems Group in Fullerton say they 
expect a modest increase in SDI funding next year. In September, Ground Systems 
won a $53-million SDI contract to develop an elaborate computer system for 
simulating enemy missile attacks. The work will be done at the company's 
Huntsville, Ala., plant. 
</P>
<P>
"Our SDI programs are doing well," said Dan Reeder, a Hughes spokesman. "The 
dollar value is up quite a bit from last year. The dollars are there. 
Everything is secure for now." Hughes has several smaller SDI programs, 
including one to develop "neural networks," or computers designed to operate 
more like the human brain. 
</P>
<P>
SRS Technologies' Sandhu, who also visited SDI headquarters in Washington last 
month to lobby for his company's programs, said the gung-ho atmosphere that 
prevailed during the Reagan Administration has given way to gloom. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a downbeat atmosphere because of the budget cuts and rumors of 
significant cuts in 1991," Sandhu said. "The world is changing, and I don't 
think the Bush Administration is putting the best case forward to Congress to 
justify these technologies." 
</P>
<P>
 'STAR WARS' DOLLARS 
</P>
<P>
Several Orange County companies are involved in the Strategic Defense 
Initiative program and are concerned about the future of their contracts as 
money for the program is cut.

FOUR-DAY WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding your article on working the four-day week ("Working 7 to 5 -- Four 
Days a Week," Nov. 30), small organizations are caught in a bind between 
conflicting demands of two bureaucracies. Labor regulations say that a minimum 
of two-thirds of the hourly work force must work a 10-hour day, or none can. 
Their totals cannot be combined with the salaried employees. The Air Quality 
Management District says make less trips. The Labor Board says not unless 
two-thirds agree. 
</P>
<P>
It is almost impossible to comply with AQMD demands when employees' duties are 
scattered from the office to sales calls, home visits, school visits, etc. Car 
pooling, or cutting down on days just doesn't work in those circumstances, yet 
the rules are applied to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
The victim (the commuter) is blamed for the problems of gridlock and smog, but 
the blame really belongs on the planners who refuse to give us an efficient 
public transportation system and continue to add to the problem by giving us 
more freeway lanes instead of spending the tax money to develop an alternative.

They're Back -- In a typical season, only one or two American white pelicans 
might be spotted in Orange County. But last fall, the birds made a sudden and 
spectacular appearance, with as many as 200 seen wheeling above the Santa Ana 
River Lakes in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the American white pelican is back for the winter, although not quite in 
the concentrations witnessed last season. Flocks of 20 and fewer have been seen 
at spots around the county, including Irvine and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
White pelicans have had problems farther north in the state this season. 
Scientists recently investigated the deaths of more than 400 birds at Crowley 
Lake in Mono County; starvation was the apparent primary cause of death in half 
of all birds examined, but parasitic intestinal infestations contributed to 
their mortality as well. 
</P>
<P>
According to Doug Willick, who catalogs rare bird sightings in the county, no 
similar problems have been reported locally. Numbers of white pelicans in the 
county are much smaller than at Crowley and other locations. 
</P>
<P>
Geese Gone -- The fall arrival of Canada geese at Quail Hill in Irvine, near 
the Sand Canyon Road exit of the San Diego Freeway, has become an annual 
tradition. Flocks estimated as large as 4,000 have been spotted there in recent 
years, but this season numbers appear to be well below normal. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, the geese begin arriving in late October and reach their peak about 
now. Willick has visited the site several times in recent weeks without seeing 
any of the geese, although they may have been at nearby Sand Canyon Reservoir. 
Others have reported spotting small numbers of the geese at Quail Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Willick speculates that with the warm weather, the geese may be staying farther 
north and could still be pushed south with a big storm. Also, the dry fall has 
meant little grass for foraging. 
</P>
<P>
Quail Hill was recently set aside as a reserve for the geese as part of 
Irvine's latest open-space agreement.

BRIEFING / EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK.

<TEXT>
<P>
A 10-square mile area of La Habra, Brea and Fullerton will be sprayed again on 
Tuesday night with malathion as state agricultural officials plot strategy 
against the Mediterranean fruit fly infestation. A new infestation area around 
La Habra Heights will also be sprayed that night. County agricultural officials 
reported Thursday that trappers had discovered a fertile Medfly in Westminster. 
The latest finding could result in a drastic expansion of the insect's path of 
infestation. The insect was found 10 miles farther south than the only previous 
detection in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the area to be sprayed should cover their cars because the 
insecticide can cause blemishes or discoloration. 
</P>
<P>
The Medfly, which can infest more than 250 kinds of fruit and vegetables, has 
been under attack in Los Angeles County since summer. Despite the malathion 
spraying, the infestation has spread and now involves about 250 square miles.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Joe Valoria felt confident that he was on to a good investment when he 
joined about 60 other doctors to buy out the financially floundering Lark Ellen 
Hospital in West Covina in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"All the doctors were excited about the opportunity to own a hospital," said 
Valoria, vice chairman of the all-physician hospital board. 
</P>
<P>
"They were admitting about four patients a day in that hospital when we took 
over," said Dr. Jesse Umali, a key player in organizing the group. In the first 
quarter of this year, the facility, now called Covina Valley Community 
Hospital, has almost doubled that figure. The number of investors has grown as 
well, from about 60 to more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when large health-care chains are divesting themselves of less 
profitable facilities, doctors have bought or entered into joint-venture 
arrangements at four other hospitals in the San Gabriel Valley within the last 
two years. West Covina Hospital and AMI-Glendora Community Hospital were bought 
by local physician groups this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors are attracted by potential profit as well as the opportunity to have 
more influence on decision-making, and hospitals value physicians as the source 
of a steady stream of patients. 
</P>
<P>
"Joint ventures are the current vogue," said Bob Joiner, general counsel for 
Paracelsus Healthcare Corp. of West Germany, which owns 76 hospitals worldwide. 
The firm sold West Covina Hospital to 20 doctors in November. In 1987, it gave 
up a 49% share of Monrovia Community Hospital to SGV Healthcare Services Inc., 
a physician group formed by Valoria. 
</P>
<P>
"Doctors are one of the primary customers in the business," Joiner said, 
referring to the patients they bring in. "They can make a significant financial 
impact" as partners. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, "physicians in the old days would order every battery of 
tests possible. Under today's environment, physicians have to say how many they 
really need." 
</P>
<P>
Also, doctors who used to order expensive drugs start looking harder at generic 
equivalents that work just as well, Joiner said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every physician would like their hospital to have the latest in technology," 
said Ken Rappoport, vice chairman of Nu-Med Hospitals Inc., a 14-hospital chain 
that signed a joint-venture agreement in 1988 with about 30 doctors at Terrace 
Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
But in a joint venture, when physicians select equipment, they are more 
interested in making sure that it will be used enough to justify the cost, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are more receptive to suggestions that can be cost effective and are more 
concerned about quality of care because (their own hospital) becomes the only 
facility they use," Rappoport said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Terrace Plaza agreement was signed, patient admissions are up 10% and 
"fairly lucrative" outpatient surgeries are up 20% at the 95-bed facility, said 
hospital spokesman David Watkins. "The patient mix has improved considerably, 
with more commercial and private insurance-holders than (those on) Medicare or 
Medi-Cal," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Rappoport said: "There are physicians practicing there who were not before. 
Clearly, doctors are influential in bringing in other physicians" and their 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
But the changes don't happen overnight. And for Valoria and his colleagues at 
Covina Valley, it wasn't smooth sailing for quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
Valoria, who became the chief of medical staff at the 76-bed facility, 
remembers the nightmare of regulatory problems that the new owners had to 
straighten out. The hospital had lost its accreditation from the Joint 
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations in 1977, the year 
before the doctors took over, because of serious violations. It was not 
reaccredited until 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"We almost closed right away," Valoria said. "We lost and lost and lost (money) 
until 1984," when the doctors reaped their first dividends. 
</P>
<P>
But from 1985 through 1988, he said, the eight general partners who had each 
invested $6,000 to $8,000 in the $3-million purchase received an average of 
$155,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very profitable," Valoria said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Washington-based Federation of American Health Systems, only 
8% to 12% of physicians nationwide have ownership interests in health-care 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
But in California, "20% of hospitals are physician-owned," said David Langness 
of the Hospital Council of Southern California, adding that the number has 
increased in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
The boom in buying and selling of hospitals in California has been fueled by 
higher real estate and health care costs as well as competition among the large 
number of hospitals here, said DeAnne La Rue, also of the 230-member Hospital 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
A record number of California hospitals closed in 1988, Langness said, and 52% 
of the hospitals in the state lost money. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills-based American Medical International Inc., which had announced 
that it would close AMI-Glendora Community Hospital in November, signed an 
agreement that month to sell the 165-bed facility to a group of more than 50 
local doctors. Escrow is expected to close Jan. 7, said hospital board Chairman 
Bill Raymond. 
</P>
<P>
The sale illustrates the reversal of a trend in which doctors had been doing 
the selling, said AMI spokeswoman Suzanne Hovdey. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, we were buying hospitals from doctors," she said. When profits started 
declining, however, the firm, which owns more than 70 hospitals, started 
selling them off in 1985. "Today we look for smaller health-care chains or 
doctors" to sell to, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Fauni, management consultant for Covina Valley, said: "The key of the 
future is a marriage between doctors and hospitals. Hospitals need physician 
involvement to give them the economic incentive." 
</P>
<P>
Paracelsus and Encino-based Nu-Med have entered into such marriages of 
convenience with physicians at Monrovia Community Hospital and Terrace Plaza, 
respectively. The chains report that doctors who are co-owners develop a 
greater respect for the economics of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
But critics of doctor investment in hospitals say it could create a conflict 
between what's best for the patient and what's best for the doctors' 
pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Cave, senior health policy analyst at Mercer Meidinger Hansen Inc. in Los 
Angeles, an employee benefits consulting firm, warns that doctors could find it 
difficult to practice objectively if they have an ownership interest.

<P>
You're nine months pregnant, and your home resembles the aftermath of the Exxon 
Valdez spill at Prince William Sound. Carrie needs a diaper change, just when 
you've run out of your favorite disposable brand, and Stephan has just dumped 
the ant farm down the toilet. And he's not even your kid. 
</P>
<P>
Quick, reach for some mom savers -- those indispensable, time-liberating 
convenience services that no 1990s mother should be without. 
</P>
<P>
A new host of entrepreneurs is taking aim at today's overwhelmed, 
time-desperate mothers. The services, which seldom target fathers, offer 
everything from massages and private fitness sessions to home-safety 
installations, shopping services and toll numbers doling out instant parenting 
advice and bedtime stories. 
</P>
<P>
"Convenience services have really escalated in the past two years," said Harry 
Jigamian, associate publisher and advertising director of L.A. Parent magazine. 
"There's been a real increase of ads in that department. No one has time to go 
out and shop. Mothers want more time to spend with their child and an 
opportunity to just get away from the stress and strain of being a mother." 
</P>
<P>
In the future, mothers will be able to flick on home appliances from the 
office, according to a 52-page report titled "Women in the 1990s," recently 
issued by Family Circle magazine. And no longer will "spotless" be the supposed 
norm for home cleanliness; "reasonable neatness" will be the replacement, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
Pagers will be considered a mother's new electronic apron strings, especially 
since 60% of American women will work outside the home by 1995, according to 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom can now be beeped by any kid, anywhere," said Robert Goldstein, founder of 
Page-A Parent, which began six months ago as an offshoot of his Westlake 
Village telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 customers have signed up for Goldstein's service, which charges $14 
to $18 a month, depending on added paging features. 
</P>
<P>
"People who travel also use the service to keep in touch with their child," 
Goldstein said, adding that most use the pagers for potential emergency 
situations. "But I just use it to keep track of my wife," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Schiffman uses a beeper to track down her 10-year-old daughter, Risa, 
who acts in TV movies and commercials. Risa keeps her mother informed of her 
whereabouts through the beeper, should agents or casting directors need an 
on-the-spot audition. "Beepers are commonly used among show-biz mothers," said 
Schiffman, 39, who lives in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Pregnant women experiencing their first labor pains now can beep their husbands 
by using Daddy Beepers, a service begun six months ago at the Medical Center of 
North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"Mothers use it during the last month of pregnancy at no charge," said Sherry 
Reese, vice president of marketing at the hospital. "The convenience lies in 
the security -- knowing that you will have access to the most important person 
in the world when you go into labor." 
</P>
<P>
The hospital also presents a free "celebration meal," with champagne, lobster 
and candles, for mothers and a chosen guest, just before leaving the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
For $25, the medical center offers a limousine to pick up dad and the children 
at home, bring them to the hospital and drive the new family back home. "It's 
very comfortable for mom and the new baby," Reese said of the discounted 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Realizing that most youngsters get into most things, home-safety specialists 
have a remedy. Two rival companies, the Family Safety Center in Studio City -- 
begun in 1987 -- and Mr. Baby Proofer in North Hollywood -- begun in 1985 -- 
will install door and cabinet latches, stairway gates, banister guards and 
toilet locks, among other items. Prices range from $50, to install basic safety 
devices in apartments, to $5,000 for complete baby-proofing million-dollar 
mansions. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times, mothers will call me and say their husband has tried to put on a 
couple of latches, and then he's got totally frustrated and quit," said Mr. 
Baby Proofer (and owner) Danny McNeill, 29, who once worked as a children's 
furniture salesman at the Juvenile Shop in Sherman Oaks with Keith Noren, owner 
of the Family Safety Center. 
</P>
<P>
Noren, 39, who operates a retail home-safety shop as part of his installation 
business, said: "The service really cuts down on your fear level. It gives you 
the edge during the times you can't adequately supervise your child." 
</P>
<P>
Although Tobey Cotsen has never touched a soiled diaper in her 31 years, her 
Los Angeles company, Bundle of Convenience, delivers an assortment of diapers, 
formulas, food, ointments and other baby needs. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends would run out of diapers at midnight and say they couldn't go to a 
convenience store to buy such-and-such a brand because little Robbie only wears 
Huggies Supertrim 3," Cotsen said. "So I thought, why not a delivery service?" 
</P>
<P>
Cotsen's 200 customers receive deliveries every two weeks that average $65 -- 
about 15% above grocery store prices. The service, begun in 1987, also will 
ship bundles in advance to traveling parents. 
</P>
<P>
Kate Gianopulos began using Bundle of Convenience six months ago when her 
daughter, Mimi, was born. "All of a sudden you find you're out of diapers, and 
it's pretty scary," said Gianopulos, 36, who lives in Studio City. "When you're 
a new mom, life is so unpredictable, you can't always get out of the house when 
you need to. It's a real timesaver." 
</P>
<P>
Cotsen said a wide cross-section of working and non-working mothers use her 
service, and most of them would not be considered wealthy. But others find this 
hard to believe. 
</P>
<P>
"These services have to be for the more affluent," said Carollee Howes, 
associate professor at UCLA's Graduate School of Education. "Others simply 
don't have enough money to take advantage of it. Most parents with double 
incomes are working out of necessity, and the two incomes buy about the same 
standard of living as one did before." 
</P>
<P>
Other services, like in-home fitness sessions, perhaps do attract those with 
extra cash, such as actress Joan Collins, five-day-a-week customer of Judy 
Greenfeld's Homeaerobics. "There is life after birth," said Greenfeld, who 
specializes in private classes for pregnant women and mothers who have recently 
given birth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard when you've been in shape and then -- boom -- you're a pregnant 
woman," said Greenfeld, 30, who lives in Van Nuys and has 10 clients who pay 
$50 and up for a 30-minute session. "I think most pregnant women don't want to 
exercise in clubs because there's a lot of pressure on being thin, even when 
you're pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
Greenfeld, a former certified aerobics instructor, began her service in 1983 
after moving from New York. "We do a lot of stretching," she said. "We don't do 
any movements that would raise the mother's heartbeat above 120, because that 
could be dangerous to the baby, especially during the first three months of 
pregnancy." 
</P>
<P>
Many local fitness centers now provide child-care facilities, such as the Firm 
in Woodland Hills and Racquetball World in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Moms feel real heavy after having a baby, and many can't afford a baby-sitter 
when they want to go work out," said Shaughn Lynn, manager of the Firm, which 
opened in 1987. Morning hours are busiest in the child-care area, which is 
staffed by eight employees, said Lynn, who added, "We have some single dads who 
use the facilities too." 
</P>
<P>
But what do most mothers, pregnant or otherwise, really want? "A thorough 
lower-back massage," said Kathy Mattes, founder of M'massage, an in-home 
massage service for mothers. 
</P>
<P>
Mattes, who lives in Reseda, started her business in 1987 after receiving 
several massages from instructors who she said were insensitive to the needs of 
a pregnant body. Acupuncture points in the ankles, hands and little toes should 
be avoided, Mattes said, because they may trigger labor in advanced stages of 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Mattes, a certified massage technician, charges her 175 clients $55 for one 
hour of complete body massage. 
</P>
<P>
Randi Grinbaum began receiving massages from Mattes nine months ago, when she 
was six months pregnant. "I had tremendous lower-back pain," said Grinbaum, 30, 
who lives in Hidden Hills. "I went twice a week because the pain was so 
intense, but Kathy was able to release it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really felt wonderful."

<P>
SURVEY: RESPONDENTS SAY THEY WOULD SORT TRASH AND FORGO CAR AIR CONDITIONERS. 
BUT THEY DRAW THE LINE AT HIGHER TAXES TO HELP SAVE ENDANGERED WILDLIFE.

<P>
Southern Californians say they would tolerate significant life style and 
economic inconveniences to protect the environment but would not pay higher 
taxes to help save endangered wildlife, a new Los Angeles Times Poll found. 
</P>
<P>
The region gave the environment about the same priority as the rest of the 
nation and expressed strong inclinations to make sacrifices for environmental 
protection, including separating their trash and forgoing car air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that Southern Californians blame public indifference for 
environmental problems and are more concerned about local issues rather than 
global ones, such as the greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
They overwhelmingly oppose offshore oil drilling, tend to support policies 
restricting coastal development and feel wary about swimming in Southern 
California's polluted waters or eating fish caught from them. 
</P>
<P>
Although the survey reflected respondents' intentions, and not necessarily 
their behavior, it nevertheless revealed strong support for a wide variety of 
measures now being considered by officials to protect Southern California's air 
and other natural resources. These include the banning of drive-through 
restaurants and the closing of environmentally fragile public lands. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of those surveyed said they believe that the environment should 
be protected even if it costs "a great deal" of money and means that "some 
people" will lose their jobs. Nearly three-quarters of Orange County's 
respondents expressed this view, a reflection of the county's relative 
prosperity. The lower the incomes of the respondents, the less likely they were 
to give the environment priority over economic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and Orange County residents tend to be less satisfied than the rest 
of the nation with their environment, the poll found. Only 21% of those polled 
in Los Angeles and 28% in Orange County rated their environment better than 
other places, compared to 34% in San Diego, 36% in the rest of Southern 
California and 42% in rest of the nation. Almost half of all Southern 
Californians polled said their quality of life has declined, compared to only 
38% for the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Times polled 2,690 people across the country over five days in late 
November, taking the largest sample from Southern California. The survey has a 
margin of error of 3 percentage points, with the results likely to vary by that 
much in either direction. 
</P>
<P>
In a comparison of the nation's regions, the poll found that New England has 
the most environmentally committed residents, followed by the Midwest, 
Mountain, mid-Atlantic and Pacific states. The South was the least 
environmentally concerned, according to the poll. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the most popular environmental remedy with residents may be 
the least burdensome: giving up wasteful food packaging that is straining the 
capacity of landfills. Nearly all of the Southern California respondents said 
they would be willing to accept simpler packaging, including a ban on insulated 
foam cups and restrictions on plastics to reduce waste. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90% said they were willing to separate trash for recycling and give 
up smog-producing leaf blowers, barbecue-lighter fluid and aerosols, and 
wasteful disposable diapers, razors and lighters. Driving less often to reduce 
air pollution was slightly less popular (86%), as was giving up car air 
conditioning and drive-through restaurants and banks (82%), forgoing visits to 
environmentally sensitive public lands (79%) paying higher taxes to clean up 
water (73%) and living in smaller houses to conserve forests (70%). 
</P>
<P>
I. A. Lewis, director of the poll, said the large numbers who indicated they 
would make such sacrifices merely reflect the respondents' attitudes, which he 
likened to "New Year's resolutions." 
</P>
<P>
"There is always a difference between attitude and behavior," Lewis said. "It's 
not to say they don't mean it, that they're not strongly committed to the 
environment. But they don't always end up doing" what they say. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the embracing of such ideas is certain to encourage efforts by state and 
regional air quality officials to reduce smog by measures that require 
life-style adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
Already, officials have approved plans to reformulate aerosols and 
barbecue-lighter fluids and are considering banning gasoline-powered leaf 
blowers and drive-through restaurants and banks. Car manufacturers are 
attempting to develop air conditioners that will not give off substances that 
destroy the Earth's ozone layer, which protects life from ultraviolet 
radiation, and federal officials have closed some public lands to conserve 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Californians were less receptive to other environmentally sound but at 
times inconvenient practices. Nearly as many of the region's respondents said 
they request plastic shopping bags as ask for paper, even though some kinds of 
plastic bags do not decompose in landfills. The rest of the nation showed more 
sensitivity to the problem, choosing paper over plastic by more than a 2-1 
margin. Both groups, however, were about evenly divided over whether plastic 
bags should be banned. 
</P>
<P>
The poll found that Southern Californians want to protect wildlife as long as 
such protection does not mean higher taxes. A majority said they opposed 
raising taxes to save such threatened species as the California condor and the 
northern spotted owl, and those willing to pay would limit the levy to an 
average of $103 a year. 
</P>
<P>
However, asked whether they were more sympathetic to efforts to protect 
endangered species or to industries that are hurt by such attempts, those 
polled came down solidly on the side of animals. That finding may be bad news 
to the Pacific Northwest timber industry, which complains that efforts to save 
the spotted owl have reduced logging in old-growth forests. Nearly 60% of 
Orange County respondents sided with wildlife over industry, followed by 50% in 
Los Angeles and 46% in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In what may be a discouraging finding to some conservationists, 55% of those 
polled in Southern California said they oppose killing animals even if they are 
driving other species to extinction. Interference by man has caused an 
unnatural explosion in the population of some animals that prey on endangered 
species, but animal rights' activists have stymied efforts to protect these 
vanishing creatures by killing their predators. 
</P>
<P>
The poll also found that environmental issues could decide a political race if 
the candidates held distinctly different positions on a pressing issue. 
Forty-eight percent of the Southern Californians polled said they would switch 
parties to vote against a candidate who favored expanding the economy at the 
expense of the environment, even if that candidate represented the voter's 
other views, while 28% said they would switch to vote against a candidate who 
favored the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to say which of eight problems was the nation's most "important," 
Southern Californians ranked the environment fourth along with the national 
budget deficit and behind drugs, crime and AIDS, and above a decline in morals, 
disarmament and foreign trade. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the rest of the country, Southern California is less satisfied with 
President Bush's handling of the environment, according to the survey. Only 39% 
of Southern Californians said he has done a good job on environmental issues, 
compared to 46% of those living elsewhere. Lewis, who directed the poll, 
attributed Bush's poorer rating at least in part to the large number of 
Democrats in Los Angeles County, which accounts for half the region's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
The poll found more concern about local environmental problems (49%) than 
global ecological concerns such as destruction of the ozone layer (40%). Nearly 
50% of the respondents said air pollution was the most important environmental 
problem today, 41% singled out toxics, such as hazardous chemicals in the water 
supply, and 26% cited pollution of rivers. Other problems cited in order of 
their importance were traffic, global warming, wildlife, uncontrolled 
development and the loss of open space. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-two percent of the Southern Californians surveyed said they drink bottled 
water, compared to only 16% in the rest of the country, and more of the 
region's respondents said the reason was concern about toxins rather than 
taste. Bottled water was preferred by about half the San Diego and Los Angeles 
respondents and 40% of the Orange County residents. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of those asked said swimming is unsafe in the region's waters. 
Forty-four percent said they would not eat fish caught off Southern California, 
with Los Angeles County respondents almost equally divided on the question. 
</P>
<P>
Oil drilling off the coast was opposed by two-thirds of the Southern 
Californians polled, and 50% said they support the California Coastal 
Commission, which was created to protect the shoreline from rampant 
development. The commission got a vote of confidence from a majority of the 
respondents in Orange and San Diego counties, where development along the coast 
has spawned contentious debate. 
</P>
<P>
The public is most responsible for endangering the environment because it 
"doesn't seem to care," according to 44% of Southern Californians polled. The 
survey also found substantial numbers who blamed government (32%) and business 
(31%) for environmental problems. Only 6% singled out farmers, despite regular 
complaints by environmental groups over farmers' use of potentially hazardous 
pesticides, and only 1% laid the blame on hunters. 
</P>
<P>
In a ranking of who should bear the burden of cleanup, Southern Californians 
most often cited government or business or said both sectors should share the 
responsibility with private interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said the relatively large responsibility placed on business for harming 
and cleaning up the environment may be a legacy of the Exxon Valdez oil spill 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"The real big problem here is for business," he said. "There is a black eye 
there that is going to take them years to get over."

GARDENING: THINKING SMALL IS A JAPANESE ART; 
</P>
<P>
BONSAI: YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY AT A NURSERY. DOING YOUR OWN 
CULTIVATING CAN LEAD TO A REWARDING HOBBY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Although bonsai is an ancient Japanese art, you don't have to be either ancient 
or Japanese to love these fascinating little plants. In fact, bonsais are very 
"in" these days -- the hot horticultural item of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of people a year buy bonsais for their own pleasure or as 
gifts for their friends. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the literal translation of bonsai is "plant in a shallow tray." So, 
though most of us associate bonsai with dwarfing and shaping plants into 
incredible living sculpture, it really means simply dwarfing a plant. The 
shaping -- whether done by bending and wiring or by trimming -- is strictly the 
artist's option. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best places to buy absolutely magnificent bonsais is Yamaguchi's 
Bonsai Nursery in West Los Angeles, a fixture in the area for over 40 years. 
George Yamaguchi's passion for his plants is reflected in the health and 
stately beauty of virtually all of his specimens. 
</P>
<P>
But like all good bonsais that have been carefully nurtured and trained for 
many, many years, the plants at Yamaguchi's are relatively expensive, running 
anywhere from $15 for a small juniper procumbent to several hundred or even 
thousands of dollars for various maples, cypress and pines, to $30,000 for a 
magnificent 88-year-old azalea that was shipped from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Before you buy a bonsai, however, a word of caution: As striking as a bonsai 
plant looks displayed indoors, most bonsais would prefer to spend the majority 
of their time outdoors. So only bring your bonsai inside once or twice a week 
or when you want to show it off for company. 
</P>
<P>
Given the high cost of bonsai, how does the average person go about starting a 
collection? 
</P>
<P>
The answer: Make your own bonsai. Aside from monetary savings, there are 
tremendous personal rewards in creating your own beautiful and exotic plant. 
Take my word for it: There's a special joy seeing full-sized fruit hanging from 
a tiny quince tree you created "from scratch" or brilliant red blooms covering 
your miniature bougainvillea. 
</P>
<P>
Anybody can make a bonsai, and any plant can be made into a bonsai. Trees, 
flowers, grasses and fruits can all be dwarfed, but coniferous evergreens are 
probably the most popular for bonsai -- perhaps because the average person 
inevitably finds a little tree more interesting than a little dandelion. 
</P>
<P>
The most important factor in beginning to shape a bonsai is the right plant. 
Here in Southern California, pick a plant that doesn't need a hard, cold winter 
dormancy to survive, such as juniper, cypress, pine, serissa, zelcoba, Japanese 
maple, quince, bougainvillea or azalea. 
</P>
<P>
How large or small or how young or old the plant you should choose is strictly 
up to you. You can begin with a very small, young plant or a larger, more 
established one. A plant that's 2 or 3 years old is probably best, since it's 
already had a chance to adapt to growing in a container. 
</P>
<P>
Since it's very difficult to judge the age of a plant unless you've grown it 
from seed or a cutting yourself, you might as well just pick a plant you like 
as far as size, shape and variety are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
If you can find a little plant that's pot-bound -- overgrown and stunted in too 
small a pot -- all the better. You're liable to find such treasures if you look 
in the back of large nurseries or where the nursery stows its "junk" plants. 
You may find a perfect candidate for bonsai back there -- something gnarled and 
neglected and overgrown and pot-bound. These plants are perfect for bonsai, but 
difficult to sell, so you're likely to get it for a very good price. 
</P>
<P>
Pick a plant with some semblance of a trunk and a good, strong lower branch 
about one-third of the way up. 
</P>
<P>
The rules for turning whatever plant you pick into a bonsai are the same: 
</P>
<P>
The first step is to take the plant out of its pot and remove the dirt from its 
roots with a chopstick or a pencil. 
</P>
<P>
Carefully untangle the roots and remove the soil from around the root ball -- 
but leave some soil around the inner root ball itself. This is important. Do 
not wash all the soil off the root system -- this will severely diminish the 
plant's chances of surviving. 
</P>
<P>
Once you've untangled the roots with your chopstick and carefully brushed away 
all the soil except that directly around the innermost root ball, take scissors 
and, snipping all around the plant (not just around the bottom), cut away about 
one-third of the root mass. 
</P>
<P>
Treat the roots with a commercial root conditioner to prevent the plant from 
suffering shock, then set the plant in a shallow bonsai pot, which can be 
purchased in most nurseries and garden centers. Now press the plant down into 
the pot -- adding potting mix if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases the plant will be slightly mounded, or raised above the top of 
the pot. This condition will last for about a year, after which the plant will 
begin to sink slowly until the soil is a tiny bit below the edge of the pot. 
</P>
<P>
It usually takes several growing seasons before you'll get the plant to conform 
perfectly to the pot. In a perfectly proportioned bonsai, the height of the pot 
would be no more than the width of the trunk of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
You should only wire the plant if you want to alter the angle or direction of a 
branch or the trunk. If you decide you want to make a drastic change in the 
plant's shape, wait until the plant is well established -- after about six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Bend the trunk or branch to the desired angle and wrap it with copper wire so 
that will hold its position. Depending upon the plant and effect you want, it 
often takes years and years of training before you can take the wire off the 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to trim and prune your bonsai on a regular basis to keep it in 
scale with its container -- a process much like shaping a hedge. You can also 
shape your bonsai strictly by trimming instead of wiring. This takes longer, 
but many experts feel this method is better for the plant. 
</P>
<P>
You'll want to continue this trimming process for the life of your bonsai, or 
the duration of your own life, whichever comes first. Bonsais often live to be 
over 100 years old. 
</P>
<P>
It's this trimming and pruning that determines the size of your bonsai and 
makes it look different from other plants. The difference is not due to the 
root trimming, which isn't needed after the initial trim. You only trim the 
roots so that the plant can be contained in its small, shallow dish. 
</P>
<P>
Once you've finished making your bonsai, care for it just as you would the same 
species and variety if it were regularly potted, (remember, it's just a 
plant!), with these exceptions: 
</P>
<P>
Feed your bonsai much less than usual -- only about once every six weeks during 
the growing season which is spring and summer. And if there's one special key 
to bonsai care it's to be sure you water more frequently than usual -- the 
plant's smaller, shallower root-system needs more frequent watering. 
</P>
<P>
There are lots of books about bonsai, one of the best being "The Masters Book 
of Bonsai" (Kodansha International). Most include photographs, or at least 
elaborate illustrations that can help you make any of the classic bonsai 
styles: kabumono -- a pot containing a single plant with any number of stems; 
chokkan -- a single, upright tree; shakan -- a slanting form that imitates a 
tree growing at right angles to a mountain slope; or kengai -- the 
breath-taking cascade. 
</P>
<P>
I particularly like the look of yose-ue: several bonsai trees planted together 
to form a miniature forest, or grove. But while a book can be helpful, if you 
really want to get involved in making your own bonsais you should seek out 
someone who deals specifically in these beautiful living sculptures and ask for 
a hands-on lesson or demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
There are classes available at Yamaguchi's Bonsai Nursery, 1905 Sawtelle Blvd. 
in West Los Angeles, the second Tuesday, the third Wednesday and the third 
Friday of every month. For further information call (213) 473-5444. 
</P>
<P>
The rewards of making your own bonsai are tremendous -- and whatever you pay 
for lessons will soon seem cheap compared to what you'd pay for the ready-made 
plants.

INTERIOR TRENDS FOR THE 1990S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Almost anything goes, old, and new, when it comes to decorating looks for the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The following report from the Better Homes and Garden Decorator's Almanac tells 
what's new, what's hot and what's just plain fun. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Autumn colors and shapes move inside. Looks for a bounty of leaves and 
berries on richly hued fabrics, wall coverings and accents. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The jeweled tones and nostalgic charm of tapestries and needlepoints are 
weaving their way back into the home. If rugs or furniture don't fit into the 
budget, accent pillows add dashes of the decorating delicacy. Use them to warm 
modern schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The once-chunky profiles of sleep sofas have trimmed down and shaped up, 
thanks to technical advances. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Once assigned to the porch, wicker now makes itself at home inside. New 
hues, including toasty brown, give wicker visual weight to stand up to sofas 
and beds. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Part of the trend toward lush interiors, fringe, tassels, ropes and cord 
are showing up on new upholstered pieces. Tie trims into an existing scheme by 
edging pillows or roping up draperies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Move over verdigris, tin is in. Accessories pounded out of this metal are 
being plugged in or painted and hung on the wall.

<P>
Southern California once had so much clean underground water that sailors were 
said to have dipped their buckets into San Pedro Bay 200 years ago and captured 
fresh water bubbling up from the ocean floor. Only a century ago, Ventura 
County ranchers were still driving their cattle into the surf to drink from 
springs. The water pressure was so great that wells more than 100 feet deep 
could deliver water to the second floor of homes -- without pumping. But the 
gush that past generations thought would last forever is gone. Overpumping has 
sucked brine from the sea into the same ocean-floor vents that once spouted 
crystal-clear springs, polluting onshore wells with salt. Farther inland, 
countless other wells have been ruined by industrial chemicals and human and 
animal wastes. 
</P>
<P>
The toll from pollution is being exacted in the water supply rather than its 
safety, and the dwindling supply is certain to bring more rigid conservation 
and higher prices in the future. Strict water quality standards, if properly 
enforced, largely protect consumers from drinking polluted water. Contaminants 
now can be measured in the billionths, and many pollutants must be limited to 
levels equivalent to a couple of drops in a swimming pool. But to meet these 
increasingly tough standards, water providers must either abandon polluted 
wells or blend their water with a cleaner supply from elsewhere. The 
underground reservoirs that feed these wells also become useless for storage. 
Once polluted, the sponge-like basins of porous soil and gravel can no longer 
be used to bank excess water during rainy years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Priceless Wells 
</P>
<P>
Southern California now depends on underground water to meet more than 40% of 
its needs, and for some communities, wells are a lifeline. Orange County, for 
example, gets 70% of its water from the ground, and the cities of Riverside and 
San Bernardino rely almost exclusively on wells. "These (wells) are not 
replaceable in any thinkable way," said David N. Kennedy, state director of 
water resources. "They are worth billions of dollars compared to anything you 
would have to do as an alternative. They are of incalculable value." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how much water has been lost to pollution is unknown, but studies 
indicate that the losses are considerable and growing. A 1986 state survey 
found 17% of the Southern California wells tested had industrial contaminants 
at levels that exceeded health standards. In the San Fernando and San Gabriel 
valleys, water basins serving 1.6 million people are so polluted they are 
considered federal Superfund hazardous waste sites. Nearly 70 of the San 
Gabriel Valley's 325 wells have been closed. 
</P>
<P>
Such losses can be painful, particularly in drought years. In southern Orange 
County, for instance, a polluted underground water basin capable of serving 
20,000 people a year stood idle over the summer while people in San Clemente 
and nearby communities saw their water rationed. The pollution also can be 
financially draining, requiring decades and hundreds of millions of dollars to 
clean up. The job is so big, in fact, that some communities, including Beverly 
Hills, have simply abandoned their wells and now spend up to five times more 
money to purchase water from outside the region. Federal officials recently 
conceded that San Gabriel Valley underground basins may never be completely 
cleaned. Instead, the officials are talking about stemming the contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the hefty financial costs of cleaning up, the pollution has spawned 
troubling health concerns in some Southern California communities. Although 
water officials unanimously insist drinking water is safe, the experiences in 
some places have been unsettling. In 1982, the state required three tiny water 
companies in the San Gabriel Valley community of El Monte to notify their 750 
customers that they should either drink bottled water or boil their tap water. 
It was so polluted that they were warned not to breathe the vapors when they 
boiled it, and eventually some of residents were admonished not to even bathe 
in the water. Treatment systems had to be built. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later in Riverside County, about 450 homes in the semirural community 
of Glen Avon were put on bottled water because of contamination traced to a 
nearby toxic waste dump. Sally and Alan Merha, Glen Avon residents since 1969, 
had just had their third child, Annette, when the notice to shift to bottled 
water arrived. They were determined to protect the infant from the pollution. 
"I bathed her in bottled water, took her clothes out of the area to wash them, 
got a diaper service and made sure to sterilize her bottles and cook her food 
in bottled water," recalled Sally Merha, 43, a homemaker. "It was really tough, 
but I was terrified of exposing her." The rest of the family drank bottled 
water but continued to bathe in the polluted water. "You can't very well take a 
shower with bottled water," Merha said. She suspects, but cannot be certain, 
that the polluted water was responsible for what seemed to be an unusual number 
of illnesses in her family before 1984. Eventually, the state spent $5 million 
to provide Glen Avon residents with clean water. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, such episodes have made many people wary of using tap water, 
even in communities where there has been no suggestion of contamination. A 1986 
Times poll found that a third of the residents surveyed drink bottled water 
because they think it is purer, despite assurances by health and water 
officials that the tap water is safe. "It just astounds me to see these people 
lugging giant bottles out of the grocery store when the tap water is so good 
and costs 10 times less," said Ron Baetz, spokesman for the Desert Water Agency 
in Palm Springs, where the underground water is so clean it is not even 
treated. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Californians first began confronting pollution of their underground 
water in the 1920s, when seawater seeped into onshore wells. During the early 
1940s, the lawn at Redondo Beach High School turned brown and died -- seawater 
had been sucked into the school well. Agricultural fertilizers and septic tanks 
later were discovered to have contaminated other water basins, and industries 
that for decades dumped their wastes into cesspools polluted many of the 
region's most productive wells. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to combat the various pollutants are getting mixed results. Seawater 
intrusion is being successfully stopped in some places by injecting clean water 
underground to form a barrier between the invading brine and the wells farther 
inland. Strict rules limiting pumping also have helped stem the salt 
contamination, and efforts are expanding to replenish underground basins with 
imported water. Man-made basins are now used to store water from outside the 
region during rainy years. In the windy Coachella Valley, just northwest of 
Palm Springs, these so-called replenishment ponds became such a favorite with 
windsurfers a few years ago that the water district considered creating a 
"windsurfing resort" on the site. The plan has been on hold since the drought 
hit three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Research into removing agricultural pollutants or nitrates from ground water is 
making progress as well, with a method developed in Orange County proving 95% 
successful in the laboratory and in a small pilot project. Some communities 
have even managed to remove industrial chemicals from wells at a relatively low 
cost. For example, one of the small, El Monte water companies where the wells 
were severely polluted managed to clean them up with a $40,000 filter system. 
</P>
<P>
Although these success stories offer hope, water officials have lots of reasons 
to worry. Landfills and underground storage tanks continue to leak, and many 
homes and businesses still use septic tanks. Plumes of contamination are 
traveling in water basins and undoubtedly will pollute more wells. Moreover, it 
takes only a small amount of contamination to ruin an entire water supply. One 
20-gallon chemical spill at a construction site, for example, can destroy a 
small town's well. "The (pollution) situation is only going to get worse in the 
future," a Metropolitan Water District spokesman predicts. 
</P>
<P>
As officials in San Diego have learned, contamination can pose entirely 
unexpected problems. An underground pool of polluted water there has stalled a 
redevelopment project near the ocean. To build high-rises on the coastal land, 
it first must be drained and shored up to support the buildings' weight. But no 
one wants to drain the land and get stuck with the contaminated water. Despite 
this grim picture, health and water officials maintain that water safety 
standards and routine monitoring adequately protect public health. Indeed, some 
water officials, and even an environmentalist or two, argue that ground water 
may be safer than surface water, such as rivers or lakes. The big question is 
whether there will be enough water in the future. Environmental concerns over 
wildlife and fisheries in waterways outside Southern California will make it 
increasingly difficult for the region to draw from them, and as drinking water 
standards become more stringent, more wells will be abandoned. State and local 
water officials predict water rates eventually will run as high as telephone 
bills and more consumers will be required -- and not merely asked -- to install 
conservation devices on shower heads and toilets.

"You can have lawns," said W. Don Maughan, chairman of the State Water 
Resources Control Board. "It won't go that far. But you're going to have to pay 
more for water and you're going to be very careful with it."

<P>
Three views on our progress, rated on a one to 10 scale 
</P>
<P>
 * W. Don Maughan, chairman of the State Water Resources Control Board: "The 
ground water quality problem unfortunately was not recognized until very 
recently, and ground water is very costly to clean up. It requires even tighter 
management at the local level, and the local entities need the authority to 
clean up the water basins and to keep them clean," Score: 5 
</P>
<P>
* Thomas Graff, a senior attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund: 
"Industries and government were careless in times past about management of 
potential contaminants that have reached the ground water and will continue to 
(be) over a substantial period of years. I think we have improved our practices 
. . . but I think there are still major problems." Score: 5 
</P>
<P>
* Peter A. Rogers, chief of the public water supply branch for the State 
Department of Health Services: "I am looking at it from a drinking water 
perspective. As a whole, drinking water quality is fairly good, certainly not 
pristine and certainly not ideal, but it meets the standards." Score: 5 
</P>
<P>

<P>
TURNING POINTS 
</P>
<P>
* 1990 -- Lawsuits by Southern California water suppliers and an environmental 
group to stop the planned expansion of the Azusa landfill in the San Gabriel 
Valley are expected to go to trial. The expansion, approved by the state Water 
Resources Control Board, may threaten a vulnerable and extremely valuable 
underground aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
* 1995 -- The Orange County Water District and the Metropolitan Water District 
hope to be able to clean $50-million worth of nitrate-polluted ground water 
with a new technology now proving effective in laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
* 1999 -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 40 to 50 San 
Gabriel Valley wells that now produce safe water will become too polluted to 
meet water quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
* 2014 -- The earliest possible date at which ground water contaminated by 
toxic waste from Riverside County's Stringfellow Acids Pits dump can be cleaned 
up under a plan preferred by the state Department of Health Services.

VOICES 
</P>
<P>
"My family has been drinking bottled water for about eight years . . . When you 
see the sediment in the water, the little particles in the faucet strainer, you 
think the tap water can't be good for you . . . I also worry about corroded 
pipes causing contamination. 
</P>
<P>
I always tell my daughter Amanda, who is nine, never to drink water at school. 
I send bottled water with her or juice or punch." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vivian Stevens, La Canada resident and mother of three 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases, I think the public expects to wipe out the (public health) risk 
entirely and I don't think that's going to be possible, but I think we are 
going to get it within acceptable ranges -- where the public health people say 
the risks are so slight that you don't need to worry about it."

SOURCES OF GROUND WATER POLLUTION 
</P>
<P>
Southern Californians get 40% of their water from underground wells. Much of 
the rest is imported by way of aqueducts from the Colorado River, Northern 
California and the Mono Lake watershed. But many water-bearing aquifers have 
been contaminated, particularly in the San Gabriel and San Fernando valleys. 
</P>
<P>
Aquifers 
</P>
<P>
Ground water is fed by surface water from various sources, including rivers, 
lakes wetlands and rain. The surface water percolates down through soil and 
geologic formations to water-bearing aquifers which are tapped by wells. The 
aquifers can be contaminated in a number of ways, including: 
</P>
<P>
1. Polluted surface water in rivers, 
</P>
<P>
2. Leaking septic tanks and underground fuel and storage tanks for solvents and 
other chemicals, 
</P>
<P>
3. Pesticides on crops, 
</P>
<P>
4. Abandoned and leaky wells, 
</P>
<P>
5. Hazardous and toxic wastes that are dumped, 
</P>
<P>
6. Contaminated lakes and other bodies of water, 
</P>
<P>
7. Surface water moves from various sources into aquifers, 
</P>
<P>
8. Ground water slowly moves through aquifers, sometimes for great distances.

For any Californians who still think the creation of the Coastal Commission in 
1972 stopped view-robbing coastal development, assured ever-widening access to 
beaches and generally preserved a flawless future for the state's legendary 
shoreline, Judith Rosener has some bad news. California's coast -- in some way, 
its metaphorical soul -- still is in danger of being swallowed up by developers 
on one side and by erosion on the other, and what remains is often befouled by 
garbage left by swimmers and sunbathers or washed ashore from ships at sea. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I wish there wasn't (a Coastal Commission)," said Rosener, a former 
coastal commissioner who now teaches at the UC Irvine Graduate School of 
Management, "because people still think that they are being protected." But as 
Rosener sees it, they're not. In many ways, the commission -- resisted by local 
governments, manipulated by the Legislature and undermined by Gov. George 
Deukmejian -- is failing. 
</P>
<P>
After celebrating a glorious sunset at Zuma or Laguna, it may be difficult to 
imagine the coast in serious peril. But that is only because so many people 
spend so much time and so much money preserving the pretty picture. In a real 
sense, the relatively clean and readily accessible broad and sandy beaches of 
California's coast are nearly as much a product of image-making as Disneyland. 
The "imagineering" ranges from workers toiling to stop erosion in Oceanside and 
preservationists fighting the loss of open shoreline in Irvine to laborers 
combing 11 tons of trash each day from Los Angeles County beaches and planners 
scrambling to preserve the monarch butterfly habitat north of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Needs 
</P>
<P>
Public interest in the coast, which ebbs and flows wildly, is once again on the 
rise. But the problems menacing the coast today are the products of nature and 
human nature -- two forces supremely resistant to good intentions. Real 
solutions will require patience. "This can't be a one-night stand," said Bob 
Hattoy of the Sierra Club. "This has to be a long-term relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Development has, is, and will be the politically stickiest problem, and the 
pressure is greatest in Los Angeles and Orange counties. The two counties have 
only 10% of California's coastline but create 50% of its coastal development 
applications -- more than 1,000 a year. About 90% of those are approved by the 
state Coastal Commission, even though Los Angeles and Orange are the two 
slowest counties to comply with the Coastal Act of 1976. Neither has prepared a 
local coastal plan that complies with that law, nor have some of their biggest 
beach cities -- Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Torrance and Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"In some of the Orange County (cities), they just told us to go fly a kite 
(when plans were sought)," said Gary Holloway, who oversees the Local Coastal 
Plan approval process for the commission. "Under the law, there is nothing we 
can do." The Coastal Commission's authority has indeed slumped mightily since 
the late 1970s, when it could dictate the color of homeowners' cottages or the 
rates of innkeepers' rooms. Now the commission is so understaffed it sometimes 
enlists high-school-age volunteers to look for banned development, even though 
the agency lacks the legal power to immediately stop any illegality it finds. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has made no secret of his desires to do away with the commission 
entirely, but coastal protection still is too popular with voters. Instead, he 
has bled the commission's budget by 40% since 1982, a tactic Sierra Club 
lobbyist Paula Carrell called "death by a thousand (budget) cuts." Gordon Hart 
of the Sierra Club goes further, blaming the governor for inhibiting the 
Legislature from addressing any coastal problems. "Nobody is proposing any new 
(coastal) legislation," Hart said, "because they know he will veto it." 
</P>
<P>
The governor's office acknowledges rigid ideological opposition to the idea of 
turning local land-use planning decisions over to non-elected commissioners in 
Sacramento, despite voter approval of that very idea in 1972. But spokesman 
Kevin Brett insists the governor thinks that the commission's current problems 
are its own fault. The commission missed its original 1981 coast-plan deadline 
long before Deukmejian was elected, and has never caught up, Brett noted. After 
13 years, only 56% of the local coastal plans have been certified. Funds were 
cut because "the commission has just not done its job," Brett said. How will 
the commission ever be able to catch up without money and without support from 
the governor? Brett does not say. 
</P>
<P>
In some areas, a kind of anarchy results. Developers bulldoze illegal roads in 
the Malibu hills with little fear of discovery, much less punishment. Fines 
levied for unlawful construction are shrugged off as just another cost of doing 
business. Malibu residents use subterfuge -- opposing a sewer -- to arrest 
growth. Laguna Niguel residents sidestep local elected officials and negotiate 
directly for concessions from builders of a $300-million Monarch Beach resort. 
UCLA environmental law professor Henry W. McGee Jr. contends tax-starved local 
governments approve many coastal projects for the new taxes they generate, and 
any other public interest be damned. "This is a statewide resource, but it is 
not really being managed as such," he said. The usually sad result, said Fern 
Pirkle of the Friends of the Irvine Coast, is that "you drive along PCH (the 
Pacific Coast Highway) and you can hardly see the beach any more." 
</P>
<P>
But, grass-roots action can wring compromises from cooperative developers that 
reduce the loss of open space and views. A 20-year battle over the Irvine Coast 
-- the last remaining big undeveloped stretch of Orange County coast -- 
recently ended with the Irvine Co. agreeing to scale back its housing-and-hotel 
project to avoid developing three-fourths of the property, including most of 
the land on the beach side of Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Erosion, on the other hand, is not easily resolved by either negotiation or 
legislation. It is mostly a product of human interference in natural processes 
of sand replenishment -- and it worsens with each seawall erected to contain 
it. Fully 86% of the California shore is now eroding, some by as much as 10 
feet a year. 
</P>
<P>
Erosion itself is a natural process in which tides and winter storms siphon 
sand off beaches and deposit it in deep submarine canyons all along the coast, 
including one particularly deep trench off La Jolla. Normally, that erosion is 
repaired by sand swept in by mild summer currents or carried in by rivers. But 
harbors, jetties and seawalls block coastal sand flow, and the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers has said that dams cut the river replenishment by two-thirds. Now 
when a winter storm eats away at a beach, people must restore it. "We tend to 
think of the sandy beach as the natural condition, but much of it (in Southern 
California) is man-made," said Bill S. Satow, assistant director of the state 
Department of Boating and Waterways. 
</P>
<P>
Man-made means man-maintained, as Oceanside has found out. Oceanside Harbor 
acts as a sump for sand pushed by summer currents, causing the marina to shoal 
and a nearby beach to starve. City officials have responded with a $12-million 
"sand bypass system" that vacuums up sand from the harbor and pipes it in a 
seawater slurry to the beach. Other cities, such as Long Beach, dabble with 
synthetic seaweed, which supposedly grabs sand suspended in the water before it 
is carried out to sea. Los Angeles County uses the direct approach: moving 
thousands of tons of sand to eroded beaches from an oceanfront construction 
site. "The bottom line," said Gregory Woodell, a supervising planner at the 
county Department of Harbors and Beaches, "is that if man wants a beach, he is 
going to have to continually replace the sand that is being taken away." 
</P>
<P>
Trash, as any veteran beach-goer will attest, is no less irritating a blight 
than either development or erosion. But because it can include such flotsam as 
used hypodermic needles and rusty scrap metal, it poses an even more immediate 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
A beach cleanup effort last year found California's shore tidier than most, but 
still burdened by a lot of garbage -- 100 tons on a single day. The haul was 
greater in urban areas, where the beaches do not usually have 5,700 volunteers 
to sift refuse from sand. Only 69 trash collectors typically tidy up Los 
Angeles County beaches, which receive 4,000 tons of garbage each year. Unknown 
tonnage washes out with the tide, killing wildlife that eats or strangles in 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is storm drains, which routinely belch out garbage, oil and 
"almost everything imaginable," said Dorothy Green of the Santa Monica-based 
environmental group Heal the Bay. Sewage spills from exploded pipes frequently 
make TV news and close beaches, which is bad enough, but smaller leaks may be 
more common -- and often go unnoticed until plastic tampon applicators appear 
on the beach. Equally scary are potentially infectious medical wastes, such as 
the syringes and vials of blood that washed onto San Diego County beaches last 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
Most often, however, beach trash is humdrum. Almost half of what was picked up 
in last year's national beach cleanup was plastic, and most of the rest was 
such picnic leavings as glass bottles and metal bottle caps. So if the beaches 
are going to improve, beach-goers themselves must repent. Abandoning a used cup 
or foam ice chest may seem inoffensive, but Don Feinstein of the Venice Action 
Committee asserts "the stuff is so fragile that it just dissolves and becomes 
part of the beach." Indeed, the beach veteran complains that every handful of 
Venice Beach sand contains the ubiquitous plastic pebbly remnants of foam cups 
and insulation. It is the final insult for our beleaguered beaches.

TURNING POINTS 
</P>
<P>
* January, 1990 -- Gov. George Deukmejian to submit his 1991 budget plan, 
including critical funding for the California Coastal Commission; the 
Legislature and preservationists to seek an increase to make up for heavy cuts 
in the past, but Deukmejian is resisting. 
</P>
<P>
* Early 1990 -- California Coastal Commission to seek some way to enforce state 
regulations against illegal development. Such work goes virtually unchecked now 
because builders often can finish a job before overworked commission inspectors 
can obtain court orders to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
* Mid-1990 -- Proposal to substantially expand Los Angeles and Long Beach 
harbors will require special planning to save valuable but fast-dwindling 
coastal wetland wildlife habitat from dredging, filling or other environmental 
degradation. 
</P>
<P>
* November, 1990 -- Election of new governor is expected to end an eight-year 
legislative and regulatory logjam blamed on Deukmejian, whose antipathy for the 
Coastal Commission has stymied enactment of new coastal rules and enforcement 
of old safeguards.

<P>
VOICES 
</P>
<P>
"The environment, generally, is healthier on the beach than even a few blocks 
inland. It's a critical resource . . . The water quality has changed somewhat, 
and there's a problem with potential oil spills from the oil islands and 
tankers. But there are days when you can see 20 feet or more into the water . . 
. And unlike the county's hills and canyons, everybody has access to the 
beach."

<P>
"This town has just exploded . . . You think they're running out of land and 
then they sell off the hills with all of those citrus trees that you see up 
there. . . . It's really hard to imagine what they're going to do to (the 
coast) but I assume that by the time my grandchildren are grown that it will be 
solid from Santa Barbara to L.A. I don't think there's any doubt of that."

<P>
SAN ONOFRE -- COOLING SYSTEM IS THE THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Driving past the San Onofre nuclear power plant on the northern San Diego 
County coast, it's hard not to think about the radiation inside the domed 
reactor buildings. 
</P>
<P>
But San Onofre's impact on the environment is caused not by radioactive 
contamination, which is negligible, but by the plant's cooling system. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, San Onofre draws enough ocean water to cover a one-square-mile area 
14 feet deep. The sea water pumped into the plant from near the shoreline is 
often naturally murky. But when it is returned to the ocean, it is pushed 
offshore, where it mixes with clearer waters. Eventually, the muddy water 
passes over the biologically rich San Onofre kelp bed, a key habitat sheltering 
hundreds of species of plants, fish and invertebrates. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-year California Coastal Commission study recently concluded that water 
from the power plant has reduced natural light in the kelp forest by an average 
of 16%. Moreover, the plume may be increasing silt deposits on the ocean floor. 
Scientists believe the low light and higher sediment levels may be responsible 
for a 60% decrease in the growth rate of kelp in the San Onofre area. 
</P>
<P>
Fish living near the bottom of the kelp forest have been reduced by 70%. Aside 
from the impact on the kelp habitat, the commission's review panel calculated 
that 56 tons of fish are killed each year when they are sucked into the plant's 
cooling water intake system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fish Lost 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred tons of fish, mainly "fodder" eaten by other sport and 
commercial species, are believed lost because their larvae are killed when they 
are flushed through the cooling system. The experts estimate that 13% of the 
queenfish stock in the Southern California Bight (between Point Conception and 
Cabo Colnett in northern Baja California) has been lost, 6% of white croakers 
and 5% of California grunion. A 5% loss of white croakers translates to about 3 
million fish or 300 tons. 
</P>
<P>
But the news isn't all bad. The numbers of small invertebrates such as worms 
and clams and shrimp-like crustaceans near the plant have increased, most 
likely because organic matter in the muddy plume falls to the ocean floor and 
becomes a major source of food for them. 
</P>
<P>
To lessen the San Onofre plant's impact on marine life, the review panel has 
called for -- and the Coastal Commission is evaluating -- a combination of 
measures such as building an artificial reef and scheduling routine plant 
shutdowns to coincide with periods when fish larvae are most plentiful.

<TEXT>
<P>
Standing atop the bluffs at Santa Monica's Palisades Park or walking on the 
warm sands of Huntington Beach, it is easy to picture the sea as unimaginably 
vast, almost limitless. Oceans, after all, cover 70% of the Earth's surface and 
contain 98.8% of its water. But oceans also receive enough of the world's 
wastes to raise public fears about the safety of such pleasurable pastimes as 
swimming, surfing and fishing. 
</P>
<P>
The good news, according to scientists, is that anti-pollution laws enacted 
over the last two decades are having their intended effect. "The levels of some 
contaminants are one-one-hundredth of what they were in the early 1970s," said 
Henry Schafer of the Southern California Water Resources Research Project. 
</P>
<P>
The bad news is that some fish species remain too contaminated to eat, some 
surfers and swimmers still complain of pollution-related illnesses, and 
scientific evidence indicates that cleaning up the stubborn pollution that 
lingers will be very expensive, if it is technically feasible at all, and the 
benefits relatively small. 
</P>
<P>
People create pollution, and always will. The questions for the near future 
are: How much pollution can we afford to live with? How clean can we afford to 
make the ocean? 
</P>
<P>
Pollution takes many paths to the sea, and the usual bogymen of tanker 
accidents and toxic industrial discharges are only a few. More voluminous and 
perhaps more dangerous -- there is not enough information on all pollutants to 
know for sure -- are the byproducts of everyday living: pollution that comes 
through sewers and storm drains, litter and even toxic contaminants that waft 
out to sea as smog. 
</P>
<P>
Marine mammal activist Margaret Johnson of Huntington Beach fears that the sea 
is being used as a "big Tidy Bowl." An exaggeration, perhaps, but there is a 
surprising volume of "waste water" -- treated sewage -- poured into coastal 
waters daily. Los Angeles County squirts 800 million gallons into Santa Monica 
Bay every 24 hours. Orange County disposes of 260 million gallons off 
Huntington Beach. San Diego County adds 190 million gallons off Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Urban Poisons 
</P>
<P>
On top of this are all-too-frequent accidental releases of raw sewage -- 40 
million gallons in Los Angeles County alone in 1987 and 1988, leading to the 
closure of every beach in the county at least once during that time. Laguna 
Beach has suffered 16 raw sewage spills in the last two years, earning that 
town an odorous reputation as "Sewage Strand." "It happens with such frequency 
that you start getting a little gun-shy every time you go into the water," 
surfer Todd Marker said. "You just hope you don't pick up some strange 
disease." 
</P>
<P>
Longest suffering are the areas nearest urban centers -- Santa Monica Bay is 
carpeted with Los Angeles' sewage sludge and the harbor with toxic cargo 
spills, while San Diego Bay is souped up with industrial effluent. But there 
also are some surprising problem spots, such as Mugu Lagoon in Ventura County. 
Fertilizers and pesticides used long ago on the farmland that became Camarillo 
now seep through Revolon Slough and into the lagoon, poisoning its precious 
wetlands and kelp beds. 
</P>
<P>
The sea off Mugu Lagoon is the only area in Southern California where the 
shellfish samples are so tainted that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
will not allow them to be sold for human consumption. But Mugu is not the only 
area where fishermen are advised not to eat their catch. Authorities also warn 
anglers to avoid eating such bottom-dwelling species as white croaker from 
Santa Monica Bay because they contain high levels of the long-banned pesticide 
DDT. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, records from what was once the world's largest pesticide factory show 
that 2,000 tons of the long-lasting DDT have been dumped near one area, at Los 
Angeles County's sewage outfall near White's Point on the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula. The state can only guess at the volume and location of toxic 
discharge graveyards never recorded. 
</P>
<P>
One hopeful note is that the worst damage evidently was done more than 10 years 
ago and was limited to near-coastal waters, where it was convenient to dump 
poisonous wastes. Pollution has not affected the abundant fisheries farther 
offshore, where the bulk of commercial fishing is done -- a harvest that 
produces most of the seafood destined for markets and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Another hopeful note is that some scientists believe the situation is 
improving. Alan Mearns of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
in Seattle said levels of contaminants in many near-shore species have fallen 
by as much as 99% since the bad old days of the early 1970s, when the Food and 
Drug Administration was seizing shipments of bonito, tuna and other fish that 
were too tainted for interstate sale. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really kind of impressed how things have improved over the last 15 years," 
Mearns said. "Levels of DDT have dropped dramatically. There are still some hot 
spots, no doubt, but over the entire (south) coast, things are much, much 
better." 
</P>
<P>
The Water Resources Research Project's Schafer concurs, but he balks at 
pronouncing the patient cured. "Before we can say everything is hunky-dory, we 
have to know everything (about how the complex ocean ecosystem works)," he 
said. "To do that, there is enough work to keep scientists employed for the 
next century." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How Clean? 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Assn. of Governments has boasted that "Santa Monica Bay 
is cleaner than Puget Sound (near Seattle and Tacoma), cleaner than Boston 
Harbor, cleaner even than San Francisco Bay." But that does not mean it is 
clean. Victor Cabelli, a University of Rhode Island researcher who co-authored 
for SCAG a favorable report on the health of the bay, has conceded that a dip 
in certain bacteria-rich waters can result in a case of the "three-day runs." 
Lifeguards, swimmers and surfers blame pollution for a variety of ills -- 
rashes, flu-like symptoms, and eye and ear infections -- that vanish when they 
stay ashore. 
</P>
<P>
Schafer, for one, is skeptical of such reports. "I live in Huntington Beach and 
I know the surfers there complain all the time about getting sick," he said, 
"but they are still out there. I can't believe they would keep going out there 
if they were really getting sick." 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles, at least, has stopped pumping sewage sludge into the 
sea, leading Dorothy Green of the Santa Monica environmental group Heal the Bay 
to marvel that the city is "producing the best quality effluent since 1910." 
But nine sanitation districts serving 80% of Orange County residents rejected 
improved sewage treatment in July, partly because it would have added $2 a 
month to an average customer's bill. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, San Diego County flatly denies the value of costly secondary 
treatment -- the special filtration that decreases the amount of solid material 
in sewage water released into the sea -- and it is supported by a number of 
scientists from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography. Director Emeritus Roger 
Revelle said he knows of no evidence that secondary treatment benefits the 
environment when used at treatment plants that release waste water into the 
open sea. "We don't get rid of the bacteria. We don't get rid of the viruses. 
We don't get rid of the toxic metals," he asserted. 
</P>
<P>
It is no insignificant claim, considering the billions of dollars that cities 
have poured into such systems. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is 
unconvinced. It maintains that lesser-treated discharge from San Diego's sewage 
plant contains so much bacteria that it hurts kelp beds and bottom-dwelling 
organisms. Also, the state Water Resources Control Board has detected high 
levels of potentially toxic silver in the sea nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Such changes in ocean chemistry can alter the ecological balance, although the 
significance of this is not certain. For example, divers have found exotic clam 
species near the outfall of Orange County's sewage plant; the non-native 
shellfish apparently are better suited to sewage effluent and have supplanted 
the once-ubiquitous native brittle red starfish. Some scientists argue that 
such unexpected events are a warning that complex ecological interrelationships 
are being changed and far more negative changes could result. Others argue that 
the net result is more fish, so the overall effect is better than benign. 
</P>
<P>
Maddeningly, the debate over sewage treatment distracts people from an even 
more important issue: detoxification of contaminated runoff water in storm 
drains. Everyone agrees that runoff is the big remaining unregulated source of 
ocean pollution -- "tiny toxic rivers (that) empty into the sea," said Wheeler 
J. North, a marine biology professor at Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
Overlooked as well is ordinary litter, especially plastics, which is so out of 
control that even in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, researchers find 
thousands of plastic foam bits in every square mile. The plastic debris can be 
as deadly to wildlife looking for food as it is dispiriting to people looking 
for an unspoiled environment. 
</P>
<P>
As public interest rises anew -- partly because of the social activism of such 
celebrities as actor Ted Danson, a founder of the American Oceans Campaign -- 
many ocean issues are approaching political showdowns. The biggest will come 
next October with the expiration of a congressional moratorium on offshore oil 
leasing. The stakes in that well-publicized battle are tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
There are 2,142 wells on 42 platforms off Southern California; the federal 
government wants to add up to 1,458 wells and 26 platforms to tap the 2.6 
billion barrels of oil that may lie undiscovered off the coast. But California 
knows well the environmental cost of that oil. There was the 1969 Union Oil 
blowout in Santa Barbara, and California still is plagued by smog from 
platforms beyond the reach of state law. Adding to that anxiety is an Interior 
Department warning that there is a 94% chance of a major oil spill off Southern 
California within 30 years -- twice the likelihood of a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Next Spill 
</P>
<P>
With visions of Exxon Valdez dancing in their heads, California politicians are 
lining up to stop drilling and start preparing for the next spill. Lt. Gov. Leo 
T. McCarthy and Controller Gray Davis, among others, champion a bill that would 
charge oil companies 50 cents a barrel to fund a $500-million oil disaster 
cleanup fund. Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and Assemblyman Tom Hayden 
(D-Santa Monica) favor a ballot initiative that would have its own $500-million 
cleanup fund and create a full-time bureaucracy to monitor oil transportation 
and plan for disasters. 
</P>
<P>
Westside marine biologist Rimmon C. Fay, a 30-year veteran of ocean issues, is 
encouraged by such interest, as well as signs that the ocean still can heal 
itself. Kelp forests in Santa Monica Bay, for example, are expanding. Even so, 
Fay realizes there is much left to do. 
</P>
<P>
"The objectives of (federal anti-pollution laws) are being attained, and that 
is a good feeling," Fay said. "But I cannot rejoice at winning a battle without 
still being concerned about the war. The reversal that we see is only partial. 
If ecology has anything to tell us, it's that we have to live within the 
constraints of the ecosystem. But we are not doing it."

HEAD Landfills near capacity as alternative disposal methods are 
explored.Mounds of Garbage and More to ComeMen in "moon suits" have become a 
familiar sight in the back yards of a Westminster housing tract. Long before 
the 75 homes were built in the 1960s, acidic petroleum wastes were buried 
there. A black, coal-like substance eventually began oozing to the surface. It 
seeped into swimming pools and lawns and even appeared under an old carpet in 
one family's living room. The sludge, state health authorities say, is 
corrosive and may contain potentially cancer-causing chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Delzeith, 47, who has lived at the Orange County tract since 1978, 
recalls returning home from the hospital in May after treatment for severe 
asthma, a condition she developed two years ago. Workers in special protective 
clothing came two weeks after her release from the hospital to sample the soil 
in her back yard. 
</P>
<P>
"When they dug over by the back fence, they had to back away," remembers 
Delzeith, an electronics inspector. "The odor was very intense. They didn't 
have their respirators on, but when they smelled it, they put them on." The 
white-suited workers warned Delzeith to stay out of her back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Her situation, as horrifying as it sounds, is not unique. Southern California 
is afloat in garbage, much of it toxic. As health officials try to grapple with 
old waste sites, sanitation officials are looking to build new dumps. The 
region's landfills are running out of room, and Southern Californians are 
continuing to generate mountains of garbage. Recycling may eventually reduce 
the flow, but not before more dumps are added or current sites expanded. 
Already, plans are under way to create three hazardous dumps in the desert, one 
on land proposed for national park status. Officials are also considering 
transporting household garbage by train to the desert, filling inland canyons 
with it, even shipping it to the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Progress Slow 
</P>
<P>
The most troublesome part of the garbage picture is toxic waste. Hazardous 
dumps cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take decades to clean. State 
officials have identified 12,700 abandoned toxic waste sites in Southern 
California, 84 of them on state or federal Superfund cleanup lists. Progress 
toward cleaning them has been agonizingly slow, and many communities are 
growing impatient. Despite a tripling of cleanup staff and a doubling of funds, 
the Deukmejian Administration completed cleanups at only seven sites from July 
1, 1988, to June, 1989. Frustrated residents who live on abandoned petroleum 
wastes near the beach in Oxnard have taken to putting skulls and crossbones on 
their roofs to protest the government's sluggardly pace. Others, such as the 
neighbors of Riverside County's Stringfellow acid pits, are filing class action 
suits against chemical dumpers. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, communities near toxic dumps report nagging ailments they 
suspect may be related to hazardous substances buried there. Residents near 
Stringfellow, where solvents, acids and pesticides were dumped until 1972, 
complain of a bewildering array of health problems, including respiratory 
ailments, rashes, tumors, neurological disorders and learning disabilities in 
children. A family that lived in the Westminster tract moved a year ago because 
all five of the children were suffering from respiratory problems. Although 
state officials say the sludge poses immediate harm only if it is touched, 
residents of the Orange County community are frightened. Jerrel Haynie, 47, 
says his 23-year-old daughter suffers mysterious headaches and other pains. For 
years, he grew vegetables in his back yard. "We always ate a lot of the 
vegetables -- who knows?" said the engineer, his voice trailing off. Aside from 
health fears, Haynie worries about his pocketbook. "I've got almost $100,000 in 
equity in this house," he said. "It's my retirement. If I get stuck and can't 
get out, I don't know what I will do." 
</P>
<P>
To prevent such conflicts in the future, hazardous waste management officials 
want to take toxic garbage to the most remote reaches of the desert. A proposal 
to create a low-level radioactive waste dump in the eastern Mojave Desert's 
Ward Valley is expected to win formal state approval next year. 
</P>
<P>
Located between the Turtle Mountains to the east and the Old Woman Mountains to 
the west, the valley is largely untrampled desert, dotted by yuccas, barrel 
cactus, jack rabbits and rattlesnakes. All this would disappear. Two 
repositories for hazardous wastes have also been proposed in a region east of 
Barstow. Under one of the proposals, 450,000 tons of waste would be buried in 
concrete or steel silos in the secluded Hidden Valley in the Cady Mountains, a 
site proposed to become part of a new national park. Residents in the nearest 
town are furious. "This is an untouched valley, a natural place," said Melody 
Owings, 23, who lives in tiny Newberry Springs, 15 miles from the dump site. 
"There are so few places like this left, I just hate to see this one lost." 
</P>
<P>
So-called sanitary landfills aren't much more popular. Aside from their 
offensive appearance and odors, these repositories of household garbage pose 
dangers of their own. They contain hazardous materials from the paints and 
batteries that residents nonchalantly toss out with their household trash. Some 
landfills are leaking and threatening precious underground water. They also 
produce flammable gases, most notably methane. In 1983 and 1985, methane gas 
leaks from the Sheldon-Arleta landfill in the San Fernando Valley forced school 
closures. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such problems, the abundance of household trash is forcing officials to 
look for new dumping grounds. A coalition of San Gabriel Valley cities and the 
Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County are studying four proposals to 
transport trash by train from Los Angeles County to San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties. "It doesn't surprise me that they are trying to get away 
with this," said San Bernardino County Supervisor Jon Mikels, who represents a 
portion of the desert. "If you could solve a problem and have another county 
feel the impacts of that solution, wouldn't you do it?" The Riverside Board of 
Supervisors has been more receptive. The county's waste management director 
called a proposal to dump the waste in an old abandoned mine in the county 
"pretty attractive." The garbage would fill the mine, now an eyesore, and could 
be used for the county's trash too. 
</P>
<P>
If these plans falter, the trash could be dispatched to the Marshall Islands. 
The South Pacific nation has expressed interest in a proposal to use West Coast 
garbage to fill in reefs and provide footing for causeways connecting islands. 
"One person's garbage can in reality become another person's treasure," touts 
Admiralty Pacific, a company that wants to ship 35 billion pounds of West Coast 
garbage to the islands. Not surprisingly, environmentalists oppose the idea. 
Greenpeace contends that the plastic liners that would hold the garbage would 
inevitably leak, poisoning irreplaceable reefs. 
</P>
<P>
Because of such potential problems, incineration of garbage is gaining renewed 
interest. State prison officials have proposed putting a plant that would 
convert trash to electricity at a San Diego County prison. Eight-hundred 
inmates would be paid 50 cents an hour to sort through tons of garbage each 
day. Prison officials admit that the plan faces significant hurdles, however. 
When other such plants were proposed in the past, concerns about health dangers 
doomed them. Dioxins and lead come out of the stacks, and the emissions 
contribute to smog. 
</P>
<P>
Few of today's garbage problems were foreseen in 1961, the year Sam Yorty ran 
for mayor of Los Angeles and made the highly popular pledge to end curbside 
separation of trash. Homeowners at the time had to separate wet trash and place 
it on the curb one day for pickup, burnables on another day, glass and cans on 
still another. Three years after Yorty's pledge, on July 3, 1964, the era of 
combined collection began, providing the promised convenience to homeowners and 
businesses but laying the groundwork for today's crisis. The plan was 
considered environmentally safe, and other Southern California communities 
followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
Planners now are trying to turn back the clock. There is a consensus that 
Southern Californians at the very least will have to resume separating trash 
for recycling or composting. Under a new statute, signed by Gov. George 
Deukmejian in September, local governments will have to reduce garbage 25% by 
1995 and 50% by the year 2000, primarily though voluntary recycling, composting 
and reducing trash sources. Compulsory programs and higher costs for garbage 
disposal are likely to follow. Eventually, some state legislators would like to 
see fees levied against retailers or distributors of certain wasteful products, 
such as fast-food packaging. 
</P>
<P>
Several Southern California communities already have voluntary curbside 
recycling programs, but these are not likely to reduce garbage significantly in 
the near-term. In Riverside County, for example, $800,000 a year has been 
earmarked for recycling projects, "far short of what's needed to do the job 
right now," said the county's director of waste management. There are 15 
recycling programs in San Diego County, including an ongoing effort by San 
Diego to implement curbside recycling citywide. In those neighborhoods with 
recycling, more than 50% of the homeowners participate. A waste management firm 
has developed a coloring book called "Captain Recycle" to teach children the 
value of recycling. "Captain Recycle wants us all to have a clean, green and 
drug-free America," concludes the book. 
</P>
<P>
But the job is more than just to persuade homeowners to separate their trash. 
Government and sanitation officials must also find markets for the garbage. 
Paper mills, for instance, must convert to technology that will enable them to 
use recycled newspaper, which is now piling up at recycling centers. Uses for 
so-called "green waste" must also be found. In San Bernardino County, a 
consultant is studying how to grind up lawn cuttings, tree clippings and other 
plant material for mulch that could be used for erosion control. In Orange 
County, which generates more solid waste per person than any county in the 
country, officials are preparing a plan to compost plant wastes and sell it to 
golf courses, nurseries and cities. "It's a marketing issue," said Frank 
Bowerman, Orange County's director of waste management. "We've got to sell the 
idea before it works."

it. . . . It's just disgusting -- battery acid, car parts, roofing material. 
Skin rashes are very common among us, and so is eye irritation."

TECHNOLOGY'S PROMISE 
</P>
<P>
Although Southern California is quickly running out of room to bury its solid 
waste, here are some methods and technologies that can ease the problem: 
</P>
<P>
* SOURCE REDUCTION and RECYCLING -- These are two of the most practical and 
promising methods of reducing waste. Source reduction basically means 
manufacturing goods that last longer and making them with less toxic materials. 
More cities are requiring residents to recycle their newspapers, bottles and 
aluminum cans. Both methods will be required increasingly in years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
* COMPOSTING -- Composting is making a comeback. One third of all residential 
waste is yard waste or "green waste." Instead of burying it in a landfill, it 
is collected and composted by solid waste companies and local governments to 
make a type of fertilizer for public golf courses, highway median strips and 
schools. There is one drawback: Large acreage is required. 
</P>
<P>
* PYROLYSIS -- The chemical decomposition of a substance by heat is expected to 
play a role in waste management in the next five to 10 years. Waste such as 
tires, food, plastics and leaves are placed in a large container and closed. 
Air is pumped out to remove oxygen and replaced with an inert gas. The 
container is then heated, much like a pressure cooker. The waste does not burn, 
but the heat causes it to break down, generating gases such as methane and 
carbon monoxide which can be used as fuel. The solid residual material also can 
be used as a fuel. 
</P>
<P>
* REFUSE DERIVED FUEL -- RDF can be made from many types of solid waste. 
Unburnable waste such as cans and bottles are removed, leaving paper, plastic 
and other burnable waste that are compressed and cut into "fuel pellets" about 
the size of charcoal. RDF energy content is 27% less than coal but 37% higher 
than garbage. Air pollution emissions are comparable to those from burning 
coal. RDF can reduce solid waste volumes at landfills by about one third. 
</P>
<P>
* GAS RECOVERY -- Any time trash and garbage are buried, methane gas is formed. 
Methane is a potent "greenhouse" gas contributing to global warming. 
Increasingly, this gas is being tapped by pipe systems at landfills and used as 
fuel to generate electricity, or is burned off. When completely burned, methane 
is converted to water vapor and carbon dioxide, which is a less potent 
greenhouse gas. Burning also destroys small concentrations of air toxics, like 
vinyl chloride and benzene, which can cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
* BIOMASS -- Waste is put into a closed container and water and bacteria are 
added to accelerate generation of methane gas. This technique was used to 
generate cooking gas 1,000 years ago by the Chinese. Today, it is a way of 
disposing of both solid waste and sewage sludge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LANDFILL CAPACITY 
</P>
<P>
* Southern California's landfill capacity has dropped sharply in just the last 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
* Capacity is expected to drop in the 90s. In one case, California Waste 
management Board estimates that Los Angeles County will run out of landfill 
space by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
* Unless capacity is added or the rate of waste generated declines, the Waste 
Management Board estimates Southern California will run out of capacity by 
1996.

<P>
How we produce and consume energy has a major impact on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation by far accounts for most of our energy use, upward of 70% to 
80%. And motorists in Southern California buy more gasoline and drive more 
miles than anywhere in the country. So it's no surprise that motor vehicles and 
oil refineries, which spew forth pollutants and toxic chemicals, are a major 
source of environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, ocean drilling for crude oil and transporting petroleum to 
refineries hold the threat of spills that would damage marine life. On land, 
plumes of leaked petroleum contaminants move from refineries toward ground 
water supplies. Also, more than 5,000 underground fuel storage tanks are 
believed to be leaking in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Our stewardship of electricity and natural gas also has an impact on the 
environment. Conventional power plants -- 455 in the Los Angeles Basin, 
including major utilities and small, co-generation units -- burn fuel oil and 
natural gas to generate electricity, all of which add to air pollution. Nuclear 
power plants produce radioactive wastes that must be stored for thousands of 
years. Hydroelectric dams tame wild rivers and flood scenic areas. 
</P>
<P>
By far the biggest contribution to reducing pollution has been the generation 
of "negawatts" -- reducing our electricity demands through conservation. 
Insulating homes or using more energy-efficient appliances and lighting are 
examples. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Standards Toughened 
</P>
<P>
Still higher-mileage cars are in the works. Federal fuel economy standards are 
being toughened to conserve energy. There is a push for vehicles that run on 
cleaner fuels, like methanol, natural gas, and electricity. 
</P>
<P>
Despite conservation measures by residents and industry, natural gas 
consumption in Southern California is expected to grow 2% per year through the 
year 2000 because of population growth. 
</P>
<P>
The same scenario holds for electricity use, driven by the twin forces of 
population growth and increasing demands for air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
Also, energy conservation measures, while important, do not necessarily 
contribute to cleaner air locally. About 80% of the electricity used in the Los 
Angeles Basin is generated outside the area, such as the Pacific Northwest and 
New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The reliance on imported electricity is expected to gradually increase in the 
years ahead. To the extent that such electricity is generated by coal, oil or 
natural gas-fired power plants, we are, in effect, exporting our pollution.

FUTURE WAVE NOW MAKES JUST A RIPPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five thousand feet below the Mojave Desert, where molten rock comes near 
underground reservoirs of water, a head of natural steam holds the possibility 
of reshaping Southern California's energy future. 
</P>
<P>
The natural caldron is being tapped to power a network of geothermal power 
plants that produce enough electricity to light 200,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Not far away, gleaming six-foot solar mirrors stretch for miles across the 
desert floor near Barstow to heat synthetic oil, which continuously circulates 
through a loop of pipes to a scorching 735 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the loop is emersed in water, bringing it to a boil to make steam to 
run electric turbines that produce enough power for 270,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
"What's coming out of the plant is the cleanest electrons in the world," said 
David McClain, manger of the California Energy Co.'s geothermal plant. Similar 
enthusiasm is voiced by Luz International of Los Angeles, which built the solar 
thermal plant near Barstow, the world's largest. 
</P>
<P>
Many see the two plants as the wave of the future, although at the moment they 
are more of a ripple. Geothermal plants produce 5.7% of the state's electricity 
needs and solar far less, just 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
And the role that geothermal- and solar-generated electricity will play in the 
future depends on a number of economic factors. 
</P>
<P>
Tax credits and laws that gave solar and geothermal electricity a boost are 
winding down. Now, independent energy entrepreneurs are pushing for extensions 
and new regulatory approaches that take environmental factors like air 
pollution into account in figuring energy costs. They say that will make them 
more competitive with electricity generated by conventional technologies like 
coal or gas-fired power plants.

HEALTH: PINPOINTING THE RISKS; 
</P>
<P>
THE POLLUTANT FACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These are key health effects of some of the major pollutants in the Southern 
California environment. 
</P>
<P>
AIR POLLUTANTS 
</P>
<P>
* Ozone: This colorless, irritant form of oxygen is the most pervasive air 
pollutant. At high altitudes, it protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet 
radiation, but it can be formed in excess when sunlight interacts with 
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides emitted by cars and industry. Short-term 
effects of exposures include headaches, eye irritation, sore throat, coughing, 
wheezing, and chest discomfort. Chronic exposures to high levels of ozone 
appear to accelerate the aging process of the lung and people who live in 
highly polluted areas are likely to have a greater risk of developing chronic 
lung diseases. The effect is independent of the effects of tobacco smoking. 
Scientists have not been able to prove that chronic ozone exposure increases 
the risk of developing lung and other cancers. 
</P>
<P>
* Nitrogen oxides: Like ozone, nitrogen oxides are harmful lung irritants. They 
are produced when fossil fuels such as gasoline and oil are burned. The brown 
gas may increase susceptibility to bronchitis and other respiratory infections. 
</P>
<P>
* Particulates: These are microscopic liquid droplets or solids less than the 
width of a human hair that are suspended in the atmosphere. They include soil, 
metals, sulfates, nitrates and organic chemicals. The smallest particles, those 
less than 10 microns in diameter, or PM-10, are the greatest health hazard 
because they can be breathed deeply into the lungs. They may increase 
susceptibility to respiratory infections. The average Los Angeles Basin 
resident has a risk of death in any year of 1 in 10,000 greater than would be 
the case if federal PM-10 standards were met, according to a study prepared for 
the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Riverside and San Bernardino 
County residents have risks that are about twice the basin average; Orange 
County residents are below the average. By contrast, the yearly risk of dying 
in a motor vehicle accident in California is two in 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
* Carbon monoxide: This colorless, odorless gas is produced by incomplete 
combustion of gasoline and other carbon-containing fuels. More than 90% of the 
carbon monoxide in the basin is emitted directly from motor vehicles. Carbon 
monoxide interferes with the oxygen-carrying capability of the blood. Symptoms 
include headaches and breathing difficulties. Individuals with heart disease 
may have increased vulnerability to angina, a chest pain caused by oxygen 
deprivation of the heart, or irregular heart beats during exercise. 
</P>
<P>
* Sulfur compounds: Sulfur dioxide is a colorless gas with a sharp odor that is 
emitted by power plants, petroleum refineries and chemical plants. It can be 
converted to the more irritant sulfuric acid, which contributes to acid rain, 
and a variety of sulfur-containing particles. Exposures can cause asthmatic 
reactions as well as nose, throat and eye irritation. Sulfur compounds are one 
of the few significant pollutants that are not abundant in Southern California 
air. 
</P>
<P>
* Toxic chemicals. There are hundreds of cancer-causing chemicals in Southern 
California air, but only about 10, including benzene, chromium, and ethylene 
dibromide, are specifically regulated, according to Dr. John Froines, director 
of the UCLA Occupational Health Center. These compounds may be emitted through 
industrial combustion or when fuels, solvents and paints evaporate. Researchers 
lack good estimates of the number of cancers or birth defects that may be 
caused by air-borne toxics. 
</P>
<P>
DRINKING WATER 
</P>
<P>
Federal law requires that all water be disinfected to prevent the transmission 
of infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
In general, when a drinking water source, such as a well, is found to contain 
excess pollutants, health guidelines are met by either closing the well or 
blending the well water with water from other cleaner supplies. But there may 
be health risks from the low concentrations of regulated chemicals that are 
permitted in drinking water, high concentrations of regulated chemicals that 
escape detection, and unregulated contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
* Nitrates: Nitrates are California's major ground water pollutant. They enter 
through nitrogen-based fertilizers, animal wastes, sewage spills and septic 
tanks. The maximum contaminant level is 45 parts per million. Nitrates are 
primarily a hazard to infants. Nitrite, a nitrate conversion product, can cause 
methemoglobinemia, or "blue baby syndrome," a potentially fatal interference 
with the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. 
</P>
<P>
* Organic chemicals: Surface water and ground water may be contaminated by 
hundreds of chemicals, including pesticides, such as dibromochloropropane 
(DBCP), and industrial solvents, such as trichloroethane, trichloroethylene 
(TCE) and perchloroethylene. While the health effects of specific organic 
chemicals vary, the general concerns relate to cancer, birth defects, and, in 
the case of DBCP, sterility in highly exposed men. 
</P>
<P>
* Disinfection byproducts: These are formed when chemicals added to water to 
prevent infectious diseases react with organic materials that are present in 
the water. One example is trihalomethanes (THMs), which are produced when 
chlorine reacts with organic materials. "Trihalomethanes in treated water 
represent a higher cancer risk than most toxic pollutants at the levels that 
the latter have been measured in drinking water," according to an article by 
California Department of Health Services officials. The maximum contaminant 
level of 100 parts per billion would be expected to cause 200 additional cancer 
cases in 1 million people over a 70-year lifetime. Public health officials 
justify this risk by pointing to the even greater benefits of preventing 
water-borne infectious diseases, caused by bacteria and other germs. 
</P>
<P>
OCEAN WATER 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California ocean has been contaminated by millions of gallons of 
pesticides, gasoline industrial wastes, storm drain runoff and untreated and 
partly treated sewage. These contaminants may pose health risks to swimmers, 
boaters and individuals who eat contaminated seafood. In general, many of these 
health risks can be minimized by following the recommendations of health 
officials. Do not, for example, swim near storm drain outfalls or at beaches 
that are closed because of sewage contamination or fish or collect mussels and 
other shellfish in known hazardous areas. 
</P>
<P>
* Swimming: When unapproved areas are avoided, state health officials say it is 
unlikely that ocean swimmers will contract bacterial diarrhea and other 
water-borne ailments. 
</P>
<P>
* Seafood consumption: The safety of seafood from Southern California coastal 
waters is variable, according to state health officials. Specific warnings have 
been issued for certain fish from certain areas. For example, white croaker 
from much of Santa Monica Bay may be contaminated by DDT and polychlorinated 
biphenyls, or PCBs. Health officials are only now in the process of analyzing 
recently collected fish samples from up and down the coast that may help to 
pinpoint the potential risk from other areas and for other fish. Until more 
data is available, a general guideline is to not eat the same fish caught in 
the same spot all the time. It is also prudent to cook mussels, oysters and 
other shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
SOIL POLLUTANTS 
</P>
<P>
Soil pollutants include pesticides, solvents, metals, acids, and petroleum 
wastes. These pollutants are most likely to be found near dumps that accept 
toxic wastes and near industrial sites. Thousands of sites have been identified 
in Southern California where industry and, in some cases, local governments 
have dumped or spilled hazardous materials that could represent some risk to 
the public health. 
</P>
<P>
Soil pollutants may pose a general health risk if they contaminate ground water 
supplies. In addition, extremely toxic pollutants may be produced when organic 
chemicals are burned.

ALL SUBURBS ARE NOT VIEWED ALIKE BY CAR INSURERS; 
</P>
<P>
PROP. 103: UNDER THE NEW INSURANCE PRICING REGULATIONS, RATES WILL VARY FROM 
ONE SUBURB TO ANOTHER, AND SOME CHANGES MAY COME AS A BIG SURPRISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When is a suburb not a suburb? Answer: When it comes to setting auto insurance 
rates in the areas around the urban core of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In releasing new pricing regulations last week to implement Proposition 103, 
state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie predicted they would mean premium 
cuts for urban areas and limited increases for suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
But when auto insurers set their prices, not all suburbs will be treated the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
Most drivers living in areas that now have the highest auto insurance prices -- 
including the Westside, Inglewood, the southern parts of the San Fernando 
Valley and most of the South and East sides of Los Angeles -- should see some 
rate relief. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance experts say drivers in less populous areas of Los Angeles County, 
such as the Antelope Valley, will probably experience some small rate increases 
when insurance companies prepare new pricing plans in accord with Gillespie's 
new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
But there is still a big question in many outlying suburbs -- the far reaches 
of the San Gabriel and San Fernando valleys, the South Bay area, Pomona Valley 
and the Simi and Santa Clarita valleys -- whether most drivers will receive 
increases or decreases. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's regulations interpreting Proposition 103 strike down consideration 
of sex and marital status as well as a driver's ZIP code in setting insurance 
prices. Instead, a driver's safety record, annual miles driven and years of 
driving experience, in that order, will become the most important factors in 
pricing auto insurance. 
</P>
<P>
But the picture is complicated by Gillespie's listing of 25 optional pricing 
factors, some of which insurers could use as substitutes for neighborhood-based 
or gender-based pricing. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, by calculating such things as population density, vehicle 
density, theft rates and litigation rates, insurers could still be able to 
charge a driver according to where he or she lives. In measuring miles driven, 
and even accident rates, insurers may be able to find substitutes for gender 
factors in assessing claims and setting premiums, since males tend to drive 
more and have more accidents than females. 
</P>
<P>
Another major complication in an extremely complicated situation is that 
Gillespie has told insurers that, except in cases of drivers with poor safety 
records, rates cannot increase more than the Consumer Price Index, a measure of 
inflation. This, in effect, will limit most increases in 1990 to 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than seeing their overall revenues drop, insurers may be inclined to 
calculate the rating factors in such a way as to give urban drivers as little 
of a decrease as possible. Under the new system, such drivers would be expected 
to get some of the highest decreases. 
</P>
<P>
All of this presumes that Gillespie will prevail in court, where insurers are 
expected to challenge the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming the regulations do stand and are allowed to become permanent, what is 
in store for the Los Angeles region? 
</P>
<P>
It is easy to conclude that most drivers now paying the highest rates -- in 
South Central and East Los Angeles, Hollywood, Inglewood, Beverly Hills, 
Westwood, Santa Monica and Sherman Oaks -- will get some decrease. The 
regulations are designed to benefit them the most. Gillespie has said these 
drivers will still pay more than drivers in outlying areas, but the comparative 
difference in their rates will narrow. 
</P>
<P>
There will be some exceptions to this. For instance, a resident in these areas 
who drives a lot each year, say 20,000 miles or more, and has not had years of 
driving experience may be hit with higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
Those who would benefit the most are experienced middle-aged or elderly drivers 
who don't drive many miles each year and now pay extremely high rates because 
they live in a central city ZIP code. 
</P>
<P>
It seems fairly apparent that most of those living in the Antelope Valley, who 
now pay the least for auto insurance in Los Angeles County, would pay more. But 
the increase couldn't be more than about 5% unless their record of accidents 
and traffic violations is bad. In that case, such drivers may pay a lot more. 
In fact, that will be true no matter where such drivers live. 
</P>
<P>
The great uncertainty will come for drivers living between the highest priced 
and lowest priced areas. That includes millions of people. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Miller, the consumer advocate who has become a paid consultant working 
with Gillespie to interpret Proposition 103, pointed out last week that many of 
the optional factors the commissioner will allow insurers to use as a 
substitute for a driver's home address or ZIP code cannot be calculated by ZIP 
code or by the present insurance pricing territories. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, litigation rates can be measured only by judicial district, 
Miller said, and these districts are much bigger than most ZIP code territories 
the companies are using now to calculate rates. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of a driver living in an outlying area of the San Gabriel or San 
Fernando valleys who has been benefitting under the present system from a 
considerably lower rate than a person living closer to the central city, even 
within these valleys. When the litigation factor is considered, such a driver 
may be lumped in with the persons living further in, possibly bringing rates 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Population density, similarly, is likely to be measured by census tract. Those 
tracts are likely to vary from the present insurance territories, resulting in 
another kind of readjustment. 
</P>
<P>
In August, Gillespie calculated what would happen if she simply ruled out 
neighborhood-based pricing without providing any substitute pricing factors, 
and without limiting price increases. She estimated prices would decline by 
about 3% in Burbank, 16% in Canoga Park, 18% in Santa Monica, 20% in central 
Los Angeles, 22% in Sherman Oaks and 47% in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, she estimated prices would increase 3% in Palos Verdes, 5% in 
Glendale, 12% in Pasadena, 14% in Redondo Beach, 15% in Torrance, 18% in El 
Segundo, 20% in Whittier and Downey, 22% in West Covina, 25% in Norwalk, 27% in 
Saugus and 57% in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
But now, because she has limited the rate of increase to the Consumer Price 
Index for the previous year and because she has introduced the substitute 
factors, all of these calculations are no longer valid. 
</P>
<P>
The price swings are going to be far narrower. And the ultimate outcome on 
rates is far from clear, particularly in the areas Gillespie cited for small 
increases or decreases. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie and the special attorney who drew up the regulations, Karl 
Rubinstein, say the regulations are not designed to be revenue neutral. They 
envision the companies receiving somewhat smaller total revenues than they now 
do. 
</P>
<P>
But the companies are expected to calculate the new premiums in such a way as 
to be as close to revenue neutral as possible, giving them as much in total 
premiums as they get now. It would then be up to Gillespie to reject them if 
she finds them unsatisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, some observers think that when the companies come up with 
their new rates, they will propose increases to as many drivers as possible by 
the maximum 5% or so, while offering cuts to as few as possible. If that is the 
strategy, many of those living in the areas in between the central urban 
neighborhoods and the rural valleys could find themselves charged slightly 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Each company will make its own separate calculations of the pricing factors 
Gillespie has allowed, in terms of claims expected and the degree of risk.

LAWNDALE HIRES 4 MANAGERS IN BID TO BOOST MORALE

<P>
The city of Lawndale has hired four new department supervisors, who started 
work in the past two weeks, in a hiring drive that city officials hope will 
increase employee productivity and boost morale. 
</P>
<P>
The new employees -- a public works superintendent, a public works coordinator, 
a director of community development and a grant administrator -- are expected 
to rejuvenate the city's short-handed and beleaguered staff, said Assistant 
City Manager Paula J. Cone. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are excited and highly qualified," she said, adding that the city 
is recruiting for six other positions, including a senior accountant and a 
code-enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
Hyrum Fedje, the director of planning and building in South Pasadena, is the 
city's community development director; Barbara Workman, a grants administrator 
with the city of Pomona, is working as grants administrator; Mehrdad Kapanpour, 
a civil engineer for a private corporation in Hayward, is public works 
coordinator, and Patricia Hagler, the director of the Veterans Administration 
Los Angeles National Cemetery in Westwood, is the new public works 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Several city officials said the new employees will fill vacancies in 
departments that have gone short-handed for several months and had caused some 
essential city projects to be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest relief is having the vacancies filled," said City Planner Kendra 
Morries, who was forced to assume the duties of the community development 
director when Jim Arnold was promoted in November, 1988, to city manager. 
</P>
<P>
She said the vacancies have forced the staff in her department to put off such 
tasks as organizing the records and creating up-to-date maps and graphics for 
city planners. "Basic in-house stuff that makes our job easier and more 
accurate have suffered," she said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also say they hope the extra help will raise the spirits of 
staff members who have been demoralized by the circumstances of the departure 
of several employees in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1987, the City Council fired Treasurer Ray Wood after learning of a 
disastrous securities investment in which the city lost $1.68 million. Two 
months later, the council asked for the resignation of City Manager Paul J. 
Philips after he came under fire because of serious problems in the Planning 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Last November the council majority forced the resignation of City Manager 
Daniel P. Joseph, less than six months after he was hired. 
</P>
<P>
Staff morale suffered another blow in June when the City Council voted to lay 
off two 12-year employees to help raise $313,696 to pay for increased Sheriff's 
Department personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Grimes, who resigned last month as deputy city clerk, said she left 
Lawndale after three years because she wanted to advance her career and was 
unhappy with the "political turmoil at City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
Grimes, who now works as a development specialist with the Los Angeles County 
Community Development Commission, said working at Lawndale was frustrating 
because the five members of the City Council often publicly questioned and 
criticized the staff's work. 
</P>
<P>
"The council doesn't trust the staff. They don't let staff do their job," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Neil Roth said he is optimistic that the city will find a 
replacement for Grimes by the end of this month. "It's going to boost morale 
because (staff members) have been doing two jobs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials agreed in part with Grimes, saying employees have left 
Lawndale because the council does not support the staff and because it spends 
more energy on political squabbles than it does setting policy and enacting 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Workman, who said she did some investigation into the city before being hired, 
said she "never heard anything negative" about Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
She said that although she has only worked for the city for two weeks, she 
feels it is an "energetic community" and that "everybody has been extremely 
kind." 
</P>
<P>
The disputes among City Council members -- which have become legendary -- have 
made it difficult for the staff to receive guidance from the council, city 
employees said. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been an example of multiple agendas and multiple priorities," Morries 
said. "It's difficult to find what their priorities are." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Sarann Kruse acknowledged that the combative nature of the council 
members has made it difficult for her to provide leadership for the staff. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a council that is unstable it is going to reflect throughout 
your city personnel," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Larry Rudolph said he believes the cause of the low morale is a 
combination of things, including the layoffs, the turnover in city managers and 
the investment scandal. 
</P>
<P>
He agreed that public criticism of staff members can add to the problem, but he 
said, "I don't criticize staff in public." 
</P>
<P>
Rudolph said he hopes the new employees improve morale among city workers. "I 
think we are headed on the right track," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said he does not believe the city's reputation has been tarnished 
by the recent turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Carol Norman disagreed, saying "we have a reputation and it's not 
a good one." 
</P>
<P>
Norman said she has attended meetings with other city officials, and "people 
laugh when the name (Lawndale) is brought up. . . . I've heard staff say they 
are leaving before their reputation can be destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
She said the staff has been demoralized because "it seems that the council has 
picked on individuals" rather than allow the city manager to supervise his 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Norman said she believes the four new employees are "not going to be a cure" 
for the low staff morale "but it will be a step forward."

REDONDO SAYS 23 SITES ARE QUAKE RISKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Twenty-three buildings in Redondo Beach -- from the city library to a room in 
the local Elks' lodge -- are built of unreinforced masonry and could collapse 
in a major earthquake, city building officials report. 
</P>
<P>
Reinforcing the buildings could cost the owners up to $25 per square foot, and 
none of the Redondo Beach structures is eligible for existing state subsidies, 
Chief Building Officer Nagy Jacob reported in a memo to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The report, mandated as part of a statewide hazard mitigation program passed by 
the Legislature in 1986, came with a proposed ordinance submitted to the 
council by city staff this week to minimize potential earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is based on a Los Angeles ordinance and applies only to buildings 
built before 1934 of unreinforced masonry or a combination of unreinforced 
masonry and wood, Jacob said. 
</P>
<P>
By state law, each city must have a list by year's end of all such buildings 
within its jurisdiction and must notify owners that their buildings could be 
vulnerable in the event of a major quake. 
</P>
<P>
Cities may also require that buildings be upgraded, Jacob said, or that 
occupancy be reduced if the building is to remain in operation. But such work 
is expensive. For example, just working up an assessment of what it would take 
to bring the city's 59-year-old public library at Veterans Park up to code will 
cost $20,000, Jacobs said. In some cities, owners have preferred to demolish 
rather than spend thousands of dollars on seismic upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed Redondo Beach ordinance, property owners would have 60 days 
to appeal a city finding that a building needs seismic work. After that, the 
owner would get 180 days to prove the building is safe, to demolish it or to 
submit plans for bringing it up to code. Any upgrades would have to be 
completed within three years. The City Council is scheduled to consider the 
ordinance Dec. 19. Among the 23 buildings is the Benevolent Order of Elks Lodge 
No. 1378 at 315 Esplanade. Its meeting room was built 100 years ago as a cable 
car depot. 
</P>
<P>
With its high ceilings and two-foot-thick brick walls, the big room has never 
been made quake-proof. Seismic work on the walls of the room would necessitate 
upgrading the entire building, which the fraternal group cannot afford, said 
Past Exalted Ruler Don Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The group has posted a sign over the doorway to the lodge room, warning that it 
isn't quake-proof, but the Elks haven't stopped having their dances and regular 
meetings there, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't really worried about it," he said. "After all, the thing was there 
when the big quake hit in '33, and it got through it without even a crack." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

HIGH SCHOOLS GET CHANCE TO SEE IF THEIR PROGRAMS MADE THE GRADE; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: SCHOOL OFFICIALS' REACTION TO 'REPORT CARDS' ARE AS VARIED AS THE 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
High school administrators across the South Bay are poring over their own 
report cards following the release last week of the statewide annual 
Performance Report for California Schools. 
</P>
<P>
As with students, their reactions vary with their grades. 
</P>
<P>
"It really reflects we do have a strong academic program going," said Nancy 
Mahr, spokeswoman for the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, which 
turned in a generally strong showing. "All three of our schools appear to be 
doing very well." 
</P>
<P>
At Hawthorne High, which registered elevated dropout rates, low statewide test 
scores and other problems, officials focused on the future. Said Principal Ken 
Crowe: "In the coming years, you'll be able to see a dramatic improvement." 
</P>
<P>
Issued last Monday, the state report shows an array of results ranging from 
solidly above-average showings by high schools on the affluent Palos Verdes 
Peninsula to mixed performances in lower income areas like Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
The report has been issued annually since 1983 by the state Department of 
Education as part of an effort to help high schools identify their problems and 
gauge their progress in solving them. It takes 40 measures of school 
performance, including dropout rates, course enrollments, test scores, 
attendance rates and extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
Many South Bay administrators said they were pleased with results showing that 
more students in the region are taking tougher classes, including those 
required for college admission and advanced placement. 
</P>
<P>
Across California, according to the state report cards, about 37% -- or 59,000 
-- more students are taking advanced mathematics than in 1983-84; 53% -- or 
34,000 -- more are taking chemistry, and 63% -- or 16,000 -- more are taking 
physics. 
</P>
<P>
Tougher entrance requirements by UC and Cal State campuses is one factor that 
has been cited to help explain the increases. Torrance school officials said 
students there are showing avid interest in taking Advanced Placement exams to 
earn college credits. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a young man last year who took 13 of them, and he passed every one," 
said John Schmitt, principal at South High School in the Torrance Unified 
School District. "It's a popular program. We have it in every department, and 
we have a staff that encourages kids to participate." 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo High School Principal William Watkins said his school showed large 
enrollments in advanced classes because it has consistently imposed tough core 
course requirements on students. "We've never allowed our requirements over the 
years to diminish," Watkins said. "We feel we are on the right track." 
</P>
<P>
But Watkins and other South Bay high school administrators expressed concern 
about continuing problems evident in the report, particularly the 1987-88 
dropout rate. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger High School Principal Sonja Davis, whose school's 11.9% rate far 
exceeded the state average of 7.9%, said she expects improvement from dropout 
prevention programs that were implemented after data for the state report was 
compiled. Davis acknowledged, however, that improvement won't come easily. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to look at what we have to offer youngsters," Davis said of students 
at her school, which is located in Lawndale. "So many students see no relation 
between what they're doing in school and their lives and future." 
</P>
<P>
Administrators also said they were paying close attention to student test 
scores in the state report, which listed recent results from the California 
Assessment Program test, an academic proficiency exam administered to students 
statewide, and the Scholastic Aptitude Test, an exam used by many colleges and 
universities to evaluate applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Klein, vice principal of Mira Costa High School, said he was "satisfied, 
but not comfortable" with test scores showing that his school was well above 
the state average but in the bottom half of schools with similar socioeconomic 
profiles. 
</P>
<P>
The school, which is in Manhattan Beach, is grouped in so-called "band" 
comparisons with schools in more affluent parts of the state, such as Beverly 
Hills or the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Klein was one of several school officials who pointed out that parents should 
consider other categories measured in the report -- such as enrollments in 
advanced classes -- as carefully as test scores. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, some in the community think (test scores) are the be-all and 
end-all, and that's not necessarily true," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That view was shared by Paul Possemato, associate superintendent for 
instruction for the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Possemato said that although test scores are an important indicator, they 
cannot be relied upon completely -- especially at schools in which English is a 
second language for a significant number of students. 
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that for these students the subtleties of the language are 
difficult to discern in a timed test," he said. Possemato said he also was 
pleased with advanced course enrollment gains of several of his district's 
South Bay schools. He said Gardena High School, for instance, showed 
outstanding progress in enrollment for chemistry courses and very good gains 
for three-year math programs, advanced math programs, and three-year science 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the entire school district, however, Possemato said the bad news 
in the state report card was that blacks and Latinos were poorly represented in 
the advanced courses. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with this and other information, several South Bay school officials 
indicated that the report will help them in their efforts to improve their 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't look too bad. We're not at the top but we're not at the bottom 
either," said Inglewood High School Principal Lawrence Freeman. "I will never 
be satisfied. . . . We should really be doing better than we are." 
</P>
<P>
Copies of reports on individual high schools can be obtained by writing to the 
Program Evaluation/Research Unit, State Department of Education, 721 Capitol 
Mall, Sacramento, Calif., 95814, or by calling (916) 323-6116.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deficit 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 272 to 128, the House approved a deficit reduction bill that puts 
the fiscal 1990 federal budget in compliance with Gramm-Rudman limits on annual 
indebtedness. The Senate then approved the measure by voice vote, and President 
Bush signed it into law. 
</P>
<P>
The "reconciliation" bill (HR 3299) would reduce red ink for the year that 
began Oct. 1 by at least $14.6 billion, lowering the deficit to the 
$110-billion level required by the Gramm-Rudman law. Legislated spending cuts 
would account for about $6.6 billion of the reduction and new taxes about $2.9 
billion. Forced across-the-board cuts, in effect until February under 
"sequestration" provisions, would reduce the year's deficit by $4.6 billion, 
and lower Treasury borrowing costs resulting from the bill would save $629 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Along with cutting the deficit and enacting new taxes in specialized areas of 
the economy, the bill makes several policy changes. For example, it reforms the 
way physicians are reimbursed under Medicare, prohibiting them from charging 
unreasonable fees that ultimately are paid by taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The measure confronts the deficit more squarely than any of the annual 
reconciliation bills passed previously this decade. Still, it leaves 
entitlement programs virtually untouched, resorts to accounting gimmicks, such 
as moving the $1.8 billion Postal Service deficit and $420 million in Farm 
Credit System bailout costs "off budget," and once again pushes the most 
difficult fiscal and political decisions on taming the deficit into the next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Supporter Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey) said "a yes vote provides for real 
deficit reduction. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Silvio O. Conte (R-Mass.) said the bill lacks "any significant effort 
to address the root cause of the deficit" entitlement programs. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes supported the reconciliation bill.

Nevada Wilderness 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 126 to 283, the House rejected an amendment to reduce by 40% the 
proposed Nevada wilderness area. Congress later sent to President Bush a bill 
(S 974) designating 733,000 unspoiled acres in the state as federal wilderness 
to be protected by law against logging, mining and other degrading commercial 
and recreational uses. All of the land is owned by the National Forest Service. 
This amendment sought to reduce the Nevada wilderness area from 733,000 to the 
412,000 acres recommended by Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who 
oversees the Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
If Bush signs the bill, Nevada will become the 50th state to have U.S. 
wilderness areas under terms of the 1964 Wilderness Act. 
</P>
<P>
Amendment supporter Don Young (R-Alaska) said the bill was advocated by 
environmentalists and others "that think they have the God-given right to tell 
people that live on the land how they should live." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Peter H. Kostmayer (D-Pa.) said "this so-called Draconian measure adds 
six-tenths of 1% of the state of Nevada to wilderness. I think that is very, 
very modest." 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to reduce Nevada wilderness areas by 40%.

Dial-a-Porn 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 98 to 306, the House refused to remove "dial-a-porn" language from 
the fiscal 1990 appropriations bill for the departments of Labor, Health and 
Human Services, andEducation (HR 3566). This preserved Senate language to 
outlaw or curb services that provide sexually explicit telephone commentary to 
callers. A 1989 Supreme Court decision struck down an existing "dial-a-porn" 
law as an infringement on free speech. The new language was signed into law by 
President Bush as part of HR 3566. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting to remove the language from the bill objected on procedural 
grounds. They disliked the way the Senate had loaded up HR 3566 at the end of 
the 1989 session with provisions not germane to the bill. They also objected to 
disregarding House rules and allowing an appropriations bill to be used as the 
vehicle for substantive changes in the law. 
</P>
<P>
But lawmakers on the other side of the issue said the House should seize the 
opportunity at hand to move against dial-a-porn services. 
</P>
<P>
Members voting yes wanted to remove dial-a-porn language from the pending 
appropriations bill.

HOW TO READ THE SCORES 
</P>
<P>
CAP Scores/CAP Scores Ranking 
</P>
<P>
The California Assessment Program (CAP) is the statewide testing program that 
provides information on the academic achievement of students in public schools 
for grades 3, 6, 8, and 12. Only two years of data are available because a new 
grade 12 test was administered in 1988. The relative percentile rank compares a 
school's performance with that of similar schools. The statewide rank expresses 
how a school performs in comparison with all other schools in the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Course Enrollments 
</P>
<P>
Enrollments in advanced courses are viewed as an indicator of academic rigor 
for high schools. The reported figures reflect enrollments among 11th and 12th 
graders in advanced math (geometry, calculus and trigonometry) and advanced 
science (all science courses certified by UC as meeting the "a-f" requirements, 
such as biology, zoology, advanced physics (see UC Required Courses below)). 
</P>
<P>
For chemistry and physics, the percentage of seniors enrolled is reported. The 
(+) or (-) symbol indicates whether the enrollments in these courses have 
increased or decreased since 1983-84. For fine arts and foreign language 
enrollments, the (+) or (-) indicates an increase or decrease in senior 
enrollments since last year only. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dropout Rate 
</P>
<P>
This figure represents the rate by which students who were enrolled at the 
beginning of grade 10 (1985-86) dropped out during the following three years. A 
dropout is defined as any student who has been enrolled in grade 10, 11, or 12 
but who left school before graduation or completion of a formal education, or 
legal equivalent, and who did not within 45 school days enter another public or 
private educational institution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attendance Rate 
</P>
<P>
The rate reported is the actual yearly pupil attendance rate as disclosed 
annually by local boards of education. The statewide percentile rank is also 
reported. The 1987-88 statewide value is 91.3%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) 
</P>
<P>
The SAT includes a verbal section and a math section, each of which is scored 
on a scale of 200 to 800. In California, 450 verbal and 500 math are considered 
average scores; higher scores are achieved by those students doing well on the 
test. 
</P>
<P>
For comparative purposes, the SAT data is reported for 1984 and 1988. Included 
are the percentage of seniors taking the test; the average verbal score, and 
the percentage scoring 450 and above; and the average math score and the 
percentage of seniors scoring 500 and above. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advanced Placement 
</P>
<P>
The Advanced Placement (AP) exams are given in 24 academic subject areas, such 
as biology, physics, French, calculus, music theory and computer science. 
Students who pass these rigorous tests (by obtaining a score of 3 or better, on 
a scale of 1 to 5) receive college credit. The figures reported for each school 
are the percentage of tests passed for 1984 and 1988, and the average score for 
all tests taken at the school for those years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UC Required Courses 
</P>
<P>
School principals report the number of graduates who complete the courses 
accepted by the University of California as requirements for admission, known 
as the "a-f" requirements. The courses include U.S. history, four years of 
English, three years of math, a laboratory science, two years of foreign 
language and elective courses. The statistic reported is the percentage of 1986 
and 1988 graduates who completed the a-f course sequence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public University Attendance 
</P>
<P>
Figures reported here are college attendance rates for the University of 
California (UC) and the California State University (CSU) for the graduates of 
1986 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extracurricular Activities 
</P>
<P>
Figures reported are the percentages of students who report that they are 
enrolled in one or more extracurricular activities and those enrolled in 
non-sports extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Student Ethnicity 
</P>
<P>
The ethnic breakdown of the school population is reported and compared with 
enrollments in advanced mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Teacher Ethnicity 
</P>
<P>
Figures reported are the average years of service for the teachers at the 
school and the percentage of teachers having a master's degree or a doctorate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parent Education 
</P>
<P>
Parent education level is used as an indicator of socioeconomic status. The 
first three statistics show the percentage of students at the school whose 
parents have attained certain educational levels. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide percentile rank shows where the overall parent education level at 
the school ranks among all other schools with a grade 12. 
</P>
<P>
Scores listed below are for high schools in the South Bay.

HOW TO READ THE SCORES 
</P>
<P>
CAP Scores/CAP Scores Ranking 
</P>
<P>
The California Assessment Program (CAP) is the statewide testing program that 
provides information on the academic achievement of students in public schools 
for grades 3, 6, 8, and 12. Only two years of data are available because a new 
grade 12 test was administered in 1988. The relative percentile rank compares a 
school's performance with that of similar schools. The statewide rank expresses 
how a school performs in comparison with all other schools in the state. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Course Enrollments 
</P>
<P>
Enrollments in advanced courses are viewed as an indicator of academic rigor 
for high schools. The reported figures reflect enrollments among 11th and 12th 
graders in advanced math (geometry, calculus and trigonometry) and advanced 
science (all science courses certified by UC as meeting the "a-f" requirements, 
such as biology, zoology, advanced physics (see UC Required Courses below)). 
</P>
<P>
For chemistry and physics, the percentage of seniors enrolled is reported. The 
(+) or (-) symbol indicates whether the enrollments in these courses have 
increased or decreased since 1983-84. For fine arts and foreign language 
enrollments, the (+) or (-) indicates an increase or decrease in senior 
enrollments since last year only. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dropout Rate 
</P>
<P>
This figure represents the rate by which students who were enrolled at the 
beginning of grade 10 (1985-86) dropped out during the following three years. A 
dropout is defined as any student who has been enrolled in grade 10, 11, or 12 
but who left school before graduation or completion of a formal education, or 
legal equivalent, and who did not within 45 school days enter another public or 
private educational institution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attendance Rate 
</P>
<P>
The rate reported is the actual yearly pupil attendance rate as disclosed 
annually by local boards of education. The statewide percentile rank is also 
reported. The 1987-88 statewide value is 91.3%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) 
</P>
<P>
The SAT includes a verbal section and a math section, each of which is scored 
on a scale of 200 to 800. In California, 450 verbal and 500 math are considered 
average scores; higher scores are achieved by those students doing well on the 
test. 
</P>
<P>
For comparative purposes, the SAT data is reported for 1984 and 1988. Included 
are the percentage of seniors taking the test; the average verbal score, and 
the percentage scoring 450 and above; and the average math score and the 
percentage of seniors scoring 500 and above. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advanced Placement 
</P>
<P>
The Advanced Placement (AP) exams are given in 24 academic subject areas, such 
as biology, physics, French, calculus, music theory and computer science. 
Students who pass these rigorous tests (by obtaining a score of 3 or better, on 
a scale of 1 to 5) receive college credit. The figures reported for each school 
are the percentage of tests passed for 1984 and 1988, and the average score for 
all tests taken at the school for those years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UC Required Courses 
</P>
<P>
School principals report the number of graduates who complete the courses 
accepted by the University of California as requirements for admission, known 
as the "a-f" requirements. The courses include U.S. history, four years of 
English, three years of math, a laboratory science, two years of foreign 
language and elective courses. The statistic reported is the percentage of 1986 
and 1988 graduates who completed the a-f course sequence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public University Attendance 
</P>
<P>
