DISABILITY FOR 2 POLICEMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two Long Beach police officers who have received stress disability 
retirements did not reach that point through their "own alleged misconduct." 
</P>
<P>
Their psychological problems stemmed from the media portrayal of their actions. 
They were vilified, humiliated, whipped, crucified, tried, convicted, and 
sentenced -- and their trial hasn't started yet. 
</P>
<P>
Do these officers really stand any chance of a fair trial? 
</P>
<P>
I doubt that there is anyone in Southern California who hasn't seen and formed 
an opinion about the carefully edited videotape that was heralded as truth by 
the media, or failed to read any of the slanted editorials published after the 
fact.

U.S. HELP FOR FOOD SHORTAGES IN SOVIET UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "So What If the Soviets Starve?" editorial, Dec. 4: 
</P>
<P>
I agree with the principles expressed in your editorial, on high moral as well 
as on practical political grounds. And yet, should Washington and the Bush 
Administration really rush to aid the crumbling Evil Empire which so long and 
so mercilessly exploited its captive and crushed fellow socialist nations in 
Eastern Europe, not to mention its own people? Or should public donations of 
food and medicine (Dec. 3) start pouring into the world's mightiest nuclear 
power? 
</P>
<P>
Should the selfless good-heartedness of the much-maligned American public be 
exploited so that the Soviet Union would not have to face serious military 
cutbacks or perhaps even temporary suspension of its no-expense-spared space 
program? These are disturbing questions. 
</P>
<P>
If the food shortage is caused by the breakdown of transportation, distribution 
and storage by the crumbling government-run system, how could this hierarchy be 
trusted to store, transport and distribute thousands of tons of massive U.S. 
food and medical aid? Wouldn't it be much more appropriate to redouble our 
efforts to save the starving and dying children in Africa who are helpless 
victims of drought and famine, rather than rushing to aid a European 
superpower? 
</P>
<P>
One may indeed wish the Soviets well in their "perilous but necessary voyage 
into the unknown," but perhaps not at the expense of U.S. taxpayers or 
charities, or perhaps just not yet.

RANCHO LOS AMIGOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is to protest the sensationalistic tone of Louis Sahagun's story 
about gang members in the spinal injury service at Rancho Los Amigos Medical 
Center (Dec. 2). It is true that a significant number of our patients are 
victims of gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
However, the portrayal of the staff as "overwhelmed" and the implication that 
gang warfare is an ongoing threat on the hospital grounds is a distortion. 
</P>
<P>
In speaking with the reporter, I emphasized the fact that most patients are not 
in severe psychological distress and that only a fraction become suicidally 
depressed or suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. When specifically 
questioned about real or threatened gang violence on the ward itself, I could 
recall only one or two minor incidents in the last eight months. 
</P>
<P>
In assessing new patients who are admitted with gunshot wounds, I am not 
concerned (as I was quoted as saying) that "someone is going to come in and 
kill them." Your reporter's insistent search for violence in our midst ignores 
the most compelling reality. Many of our patients transcend the trauma behind 
their disabilities and go on with their lives, using their minds and their 
emotional skills to survive.

LEFT TURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The good news is that there are many intersections with left-turn green arrows 
that provide motorists with time-saving and frustration-saving protected left 
turns. The bad news is that there are nowhere near enough of them. 
</P>
<P>
There must still be hundreds of busy intersections in the Los Angeles area 
where drivers wanting to turn left form a line almost a block long, and only 
one car can make the left turn with each change of the light. In some cases, 
sufficient complaining will bring a traffic engineer to the site. The engineer 
will arrive with a clipboard and stopwatch to study the intersection's traffic 
patterns. Then comes the conclusion: Yes, a left-turn arrow would save several 
minutes for those wishing to turn left, but for the oncoming motorists going 
straight, it would add three seconds. Decision: No green arrow. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not an engineer, but I have enough science in my background to handle 
arithmetic. This is madness. I cannot imagine any reason not to install left 
turn arrows at all busy intersections. It would save time and reduce the 
accident risk.

ARMAND HAMMER; 
</P>
<P>
MAN AND THE MYTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Armand Hammer, who died Monday at 92, could have had his life story told the 
way his ego would have preferred, it no doubt would have been a sprawling 
novel, not to mention a TV miniseries. And -- a man of extraordinary wealth and 
ambition -- his only condition would not have been this: that he would have to 
be the novelist. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, so much of his life's work was an effort to tell the Armand Hammer 
story the way a major Hollywood studio would like an adoring public to regard 
one of its most bankable stars: with more illusion than reality. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it's true: This globe-trotting, headline-hunting Occidental Petroleum 
Corp. magnate was not to everyone's taste. He multiplied his wealth on the 
controversial margins of an oil deal made with the Kadafi government in Libya; 
he weathered a huge legal storm because of illegal campaign contributions to 
then-President Richard M. Nixon; he was the subject of investigations by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, and he and his company angered many 
environmentalists and West Side residents by aggressively pursuing oil drilling 
in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
He was not a saint. 
</P>
<P>
But -- here's the paradox -- he sometimes did saintly work. Take his 
extraordinary contributions to the war on cancer, to museums, schools and 
clinics; and the sometimes mysterious but nevertheless wholly notable personal 
campaign, long prefiguring the end of the Cold War, to end the West's enmity 
with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
In truth no novel is needed to tell the Armand Hammer story. Nonfiction will 
do.

COACHING FOR THE GAME OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA BLANDFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fairfax High School, it must be said, has all the attraction of Italian Fascist 
architecture: brutish, hard, every component larger than the people within. 
Doors are locked, entrances barred, concrete-blank faces pass without a word. 
</P>
<P>
Twice a week, Harvey Kitani unlocks the gym for all comers. Today, one young 
man is here, the thump of his ball, the shuffling of his sandals echoing around 
the room. Coach Kitani sits by the rack of basketballs that he has patiently 
wheeled through from the locked cupboard next door. He does not fidget, his 
face hardly flickers: a still figure in an empty setting. Compacted energy. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Kitani has been at Fairfax for 10 years. He has led the basketball team 
to eight straight league titles. He is not proud of that. Almost every one of 
his players has graduated from high school, 75% have gone on to college. That 
he is proud of. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, his team comes in. Feet: scuffing, banging, dragging, enormous feet 
beneath gangly legs with strong, hard muscles. Hair: an expression, shaved, 
cropped, patterned, buzzed. Faces: flat, silent, as if there were only two 
gears behind them, stop and go. How threatening they seem: invincible, tough, 
unafraid. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, a strapping center rushes in half-naked, clutching his sneakers like 
a small, anxious boy. No one is late for Coach Kitani -- and no one cuts school 
or homework, or good manners, either. Coach Kitani always says: "Forget about 
all the winning and all that -- being responsible, on time, working hard, 
that's what counts." 
</P>
<P>
There is a small tournament today. The hours of practice, the hanging out 
together, the turning away from idleness and danger -- this is what it is for. 
"Those other teams," says Coach, "they haven't paid the price." He talks 
intensely -- of sacrifice, of effort, of dedication. The silence is thick with 
attention; how lucky they are to be held this tightly. 
</P>
<P>
How did he get here, this slow, short, kind man who for years taught 
handicapped children and special education? Gardena High School, Cal State Long 
Beach -- he came from streets such as these. He went to college as a business 
major; his father, a Sansei gardener who went to internment camp during the 
war, saw the whole world as business. He scrimped and saved for his family from 
long hours. And yet Coach Kitani cannot remember a morning his father did not 
wake him for school. 
</P>
<P>
A basketball coach: 10 cents an hour if all the hours are added together, the 
hours combing the city to study other teams, other players, to practice, plan, 
train, hold the players together. A basketball coach: an insignificant job in 
the scheme of things, paid as it is valued. But watch these young men, heads 
held in attention; armies would like to seem thus. 
</P>
<P>
And watch them later winning the first round, the semifinals, the final: the 
concentration, the way of dropping a ball without question after a call, of 
turning away like a rifle shot from a referee's harsh decision, of going in 
with heart, of coming out with dignity. 
</P>
<P>
But look, too, to the stands behind the Fairfax team -- to the mothers, 
grandmothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, there for every game. Burt's father, 
honeyed with pride as his stocky son runs his heart out. Hamp's father, work 
boots covered in dust, sits at the back without moving. But watch his eyes -- 
they are a hawk's eyes full of deep, rough love for his boy. Roderick's 
grandma: Everyone knows Roderick's grandma -- and no one swears around her, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan Hickman, the all-star, 6 feet, 6 inches, a hair's breadth away from a 
college scholarship: bumped, guarded, chided, taunted and finally, in a flash 
of anger, he rounds with a snarl. From the stands comes a high, piping voice: 
"Ryan, you calm down!" In an instant, he recoils. It is the only time all 
evening that anyone hears from Ryan's mother. 
</P>
<P>
For years these parents have worked -- jobs, extra jobs, tired hours of holding 
a boy fast, watching over him, making a difference. For some, this game will be 
all there is. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Kitani is not a shouter; his anger, though, is ice cold, his 
disappointment cuts with its fury, his praise is barely perceptible. Were he 
teaching history, would he be tolerated thus? Do classroom teachers have this 
control, this right to fury and passion? Or is it only in sports, which we 
think is so much like war, that young men may be screamed at, drilled, driven 
beyond themselves -- but also inspired, touched, cared for and believed in?

WHAT DO ARABS WANT?; 
</P>
<P>
APPEASEMENT: MILITANTS KINDLE THE PAN-ARAB DREAM, BUT THEIR AGGRESSIVE FASCISM 
POSESA PERMANENT REGIONAL THREAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALTER LAQUEUR, Walter Laqueur is chairman of the International Research 
Council of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saddam Hussein, in contrast to most other leaders in the contemporary world, 
has a grand design, and he has not made a secret of it: He wants to unite the 
Arab countries under his leadership and to replace the Soviet Union as the 
second superpower. He stated his aim in a number of speeches before the 
invasion of Kuwait, at a time when few people outside Iraq paid much attention. 
The next five years will be difficult, he said, but given the decline of the 
Soviet Union and America's inability to act decisively, the old pan-Arab target 
might at long last be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's second article of faith is equally simple: Given the essential 
weakness of the Arab world, except for its oil weapon, the aim can be reached 
only through unorthodox means -- that is, unconventional weapons. Iraq's GNP 
would grow sixfold or more if the oil fields within 50 miles of its borders 
were incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to unite the Arab-speaking world under one leader are not new. This 
has been the basic tenet of the Baath Party, founded more than 50 years ago by 
Hussein's mentors. It was the main article of faith of Gamal Abdul Nasser, who 
had far more charisma and popular support than the Iraqi leader. 
</P>
<P>
If the majority of Arabs want to join forces and establish a single state, 
opposition on the part of outsiders would be unjustified. Nor do Washington and 
Moscow have a permanent monopoly as far as superpower status is concerned. The 
history of mankind is a sequence of the rise and decline of great powers. 
</P>
<P>
But what do the Arabs want? We do not know, for the winds of democratic change 
have bypassed the Arab East. There is not one Arab government -- with the 
partial exception of Egypt -- that has been popularly elected. The most 
militant pan-Arabists also happen to be closest to a modern version of 
aggressive fascism, oppressing their own peoples and permanently threatening 
their neighbors, Arabs and non-Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
This may change. For now, aggressive dictatorship is the basic fact of 
political life in the Middle East. So is the possession of the means of mass 
destruction. The combination can be deadly. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been foreseen that the proliferation of nuclear and other 
unconventional weapons would sooner or later lead to a situation such as that 
now unfolding in the Persian Gulf. The world was a safer place when nuclear 
arms were the preserve of a few great powers. Even now it is unthinkable that a 
country like Brazil (or India or Israel) would use nuclear devices as an 
instrument of war or political pressure -- except when attacked and if national 
existence were at stake. Saddam Hussein has made it known that his approach is 
different. There is no reason to dismiss it as mere "Arab rhetoric," as some 
have done. 
</P>
<P>
But why should the United States take the lead facing this danger? After all, 
Iraq will not attack America (or Russia). In principle, the problem should be 
dealt with by the Arab world and the United Nations. Unfortunately, the Arab 
world is hopelessly divided, incapable of dealing with any problem. As for the 
United Nations, it simply does not have the authority and power to deal with a 
problem of this kind. It might acquire such power after the first nuclear war, 
but hardly before. Could it be that those recommending an Arab or U.N. solution 
are voting -- by default -- for nuclear war in the Middle East? 
</P>
<P>
The United States has taken upon itself the ungrateful task of confronting 
Hussein because it is the only major power that has the military might and 
possibly the political will to do so. Others, if not preoccupied with their own 
affairs, have become accustomed to the idea that it is prudent to let America 
deal, single-handedly if necessary, with critical situations. But this era is 
nearing its end; American power is insufficient to deal with the threats of the 
new age of proliferation. Today the problem is Saddam Hussein; tomorrow it 
might be an aggressor in another part of the globe. 
</P>
<P>
It is not at all certain whether American resolve is sufficient to deal with 
Iraq. The natural inclination of every democracy is toward peace, not war, 
except in the case of a clear, present and immediate danger. A land war with 
the sole aim of liberating Kuwait makes no military sense. Why sacrifice the 
life of a single American for a faraway country about which so little is known 
and in which vital American interests are only marginally involved? Why take 
the lead if the rest of the world is showing little enthusiasm for any action 
that would remove the threat and the means of aggression? There is a high 
probability that in the next war the Middle East will go up in flames -- and 
not just figuratively. But there is no certainty. Perhaps something totally 
unexpected will happen. Perhaps Hussein will be sufficiently frightened not to 
engage in further aggression. 
</P>
<P>
Common sense rebels against violent action. The voice of common sense was 
Neville Chamberlain who, like all educated Englishmen of his time, knew his 
Shakespeare. When he returned from Munich in 1938, he quoted Henry IV: "Out of 
this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety." The quotation was right, 
but he was mistaken about the flower. Perhaps we shall be luckier, but we 
should not count on it.

RACE AND HATE IN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD REEVES, Richard Reeves writes a syndicated column based in 
Washington 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Race reverberates in American politics like no other issue, past or present. 
</P>
<P>
It always has, at least as far as I can tell. Alexis de Tocqueville, who sat 
next to John Quincy Adams at dinner in Boston one night in the spring of 1831, 
asked the great man what was the greatest problem in the new republic. 
"Slavery," Adams said. "That is the root of almost all the troubles of the 
present and the fears for the future." 
</P>
<P>
The country's sixth President then added: "I know nothing more insolent than a 
black, when he is not speaking to his master and is not afraid of a beating . . 
. . The Negro women especially very often take advantage of their mistresses' 
kindness. They know that it is not the custom to inflict corporal punishment on 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Adams' views were milder than those of a predecessor, who offered these 
thoughts: 
</P>
<P>
"The real distinctions that nature has made, and many other circumstances, will 
divide us into parties and produce convulsions which will probably never end 
but in the extermination of the one or the other race . . . . They have less 
hair on the face and the body. They secrete less by the kidneys and more by the 
glands of the skin, which gives them a very strong and disagreeable odour . . . 
. Comparing them by their faculties of memory, reason and imagination, it 
appears to me, that in memory they are equal to whites, in reason much inferior 
. . . and that in imagination they are dull, tasteless and anomalous . . . . In 
music they are generally more gifted than whites . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
If many modern Americans find those words to be stupid or offensive, I 
apologize. It was Thomas Jefferson who said them. 
</P>
<P>
There is no point in writing a column like this if you do not plan to 
occasionally yell "Fraud!" at the dishonesty of political dialogue. My purpose 
in quoting Jefferson at his worst is to argue that we were racist at the 
beginning -- in the modern dictionary sense of unscientific perceptions of 
racial differences in character and intelligence -- and we, whites and blacks, 
have not improved on that as much as we like to say we have. 
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville concluded his thoughts on equality in America with this note to 
himself: 
</P>
<P>
"It's not now a question of equality before the law; that kind is complete in 
America . . . . But when one wishes to estimate the equality between different 
classes, one must always come to the questions of how marriages are made. 
That's the bottom of the matter. An equality resulting from necessity, courtesy 
or politics may exist on the surface and deceive the eye." 
</P>
<P>
Look at the social pages in any American newspaper today, the words and the 
pictures. We are intermarrying across lines of geography, economic class and 
religion as never before. People seem to marry now by shared aspiration, by 
their conception of where they are going in this life. But the racial line is 
rarely crossed. Black and white together? No, we are still living separate 
lives -- and at the moment, that separatism may be getting worse rather than 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is time for us to talk about and do something about what is really 
going on racially in the United States right now -- about fear and hatred, and 
the unresolved questions and feelings of years of lying to ourselves in public.

BLACKHAWKS' SUCCESS IS NO SURPRISE TO KEENAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chicago Blackhawks, who have the best record in the NHL, might be a 
surprise to some people, but not to Coach Mike Keenan. 
</P>
<P>
"We are playing the way I expected," Keenan said after a 4-1 victory for his 
team over the Penguins Tuesday night at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Murray, Steve Larmer and Mike McNeill scored goals in a four-minute span 
of the third period to break it open and improve Chicago's record to 21-10-2. 
</P>
<P>
After Larmer's goal at 10:49 gave the Blackhawks a 3-1 lead, Pittsburgh goalie 
Frank Pietrangelo blew his cool. Apparently believing he was interfered with by 
a Chicago player on Larmer's goal, Pietrangelo argued with referee Mike Hudson, 
slammed his stick against the goal cage and was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
Two minutes after Wendell Young replaced Pietrangelo, McNeill scored the final 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks are 9-2-1 in their past 12 games. They have 44 points and lead 
the Norris Division by six points over St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"We improved to 41 victories last season, and I'm not surprised we are doing 
better," Keenan said. "I'm not gloating, though. I think we can play better. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to improve our special teams, do a better job with defensive zone 
coverage and upgrade our communications skills." 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 5, Minnesota 4 -- Al MacInnis, the top scoring defenseman in the 
league, had a goal and two assists at Bloomington, Minn., to extend his scoring 
streak to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
MacInnis helped the Flames, leaders of the Smythe Division, build a 5-1 lead in 
the first minute of the last period. 
</P>
<P>
The North Stars refused to quit. They scored three times in seven minutes and 
were only a goal behind with more than five minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg 3, St. Louis 3 -- Phil Sykes scored early in the third period at St. 
Louis to enable the Jets to tie for the fourth consecutive game. It was their 
fifth tie in the past seven games. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues dominated the five-minute overtime, but couldn't put any of its seven 
shots in to win it. 
</P>
<P>
Geoff Courtnall, who had not scored for 13 games, had a goal for the Blues and 
assisted on the other two. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 8, Buffalo 3 -- Steve Yzerman, a little slow to reach his stride this 
season, is finally starting to roll. 
</P>
<P>
He had two goals and three assists at Detroit to lead the romp that made it 
easy for goalie Glen Hanlon. 
</P>
<P>
Hanlon, making his fourth start since being brought back from San Diego in late 
November, blocked 28 shots. 
</P>
<P>
With Yzerman getting the first two goals, the second with Detroit short-handed, 
the Red Wings scored five times in the second period and the Sabres were out of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Keith Primeau, the third player taken in the draft last spring, scored 
his first NHL goal for the Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 3, New Jersey 2 -- Ray Ferraro scored his second goal of the 
game with 42 seconds left in regulation at Uniondale, N.Y., and the Islanders 
ended their seven-game winless streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders dominated the first two periods and led, 2-0, six minutes into 
the final period. But, Brendan Shanahan and Claude Lemieux scored on power 
plays, and it seemed the teams were headed for overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Ferraro took a pass from Bill Berg and, using teammate Tom Fitzgerald as a 
screen, faked goalie Chris Terreri and shoveled the puck into the open net. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 4, Philadelphia 1 -- Dino Ciccarelli, who missed 20 games because of 
a thumb injury, is back in form. 
</P>
<P>
Ciccarelli, in only his third game since getting off the injured list, had a 
goal and an assist at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals are 8-4-0 in the past 12 games, and the Flyers have lost four of 
their past five. The Capitals are 5-0-1 in the past six games with the Flyers.

NBA ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
BUCKS MAKE BELIEVERS OF THE BULLS, 99-87 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Milwaukee Bucks have been trying to convince the rest of the NBA that their 
fast start is not a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
The league should begin to believe them. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Humphries had 21 points and Frank Brickowski had 19 Tuesday night to lead 
the Bucks to a 99-87 victory over the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
A 24-10 run in the third quarter broke open a close game and gave the Bucks, 
the only team still unbeaten at home, their club record 11th victory in a row 
at home. It also put them into first place in the Central Division, ahead of 
the slumping Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls have been beating the Bucks regularly in the last three seasons. 
Including three out of four in the playoffs last spring, the Bulls had won 18 
of the last 21. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls led most of the first half and led, 58-53, in the third quarter. But 
Alvin Robertson, who feels he is the unappreciated and unwanted Buck, scored 
six points in a 13-2 spurt that put the Bucks ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan had 31 points to lead the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why we have done so well at home," Coach Del Harris said. "I 
don't think we have any home-court advantage. The players just work their tails 
off. We have a much quieter home crowd than most teams. They seem to be getting 
a little more into it with each victory. Maybe they are believing in us, too." 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 95, Detroit 86 -- The Pistons blamed fatigue for losing four of 
five on a tough trip West. Apparently, being home since Sunday failed to 
refresh them. 
</P>
<P>
They didn't score a basket in the first four minutes at Auburn Hills, Mich., 
fell behind and stayed there most of the game. It was the Pistons' first loss 
at home after eight victories and knocked them out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
David Robinson had 27 points and 16 rebounds for the Spurs, who also had a big 
game off the bench from David Greenwood. Greenwood was summoned when Terry 
Cummings suffered an injured left knee and left the game shortly before 
halftime. Greenwood made six of his seven shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs shot only 44.6%, but the two-time NBA champions made only 40.3% 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons' sharpshooting guards -- Joe Dumars, Isiah Thomas and Vinnie 
Johnson -- were a combined 10 for 29. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 122, Indiana 96 -- The rumor is that the Pacers need a good trip West 
to save Coach Dick Versace's job. So far, so bad. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Duckworth scored 15 points in the first half at Portland and the Trail 
Blazers scored their eighth consecutive victory. The Blazers improved the 
league's best record to 19-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers have three more games on the trip -- -- at Seattle, at Utah and 
against the Lakers at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 113, Sacramento 90 -- Xavier McDaniel, obtained from Seattle last week, 
scored 20 points on 10-for-15 shooting at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Johnson scored 11 of his 26 in the third quarter when the Suns broke it 
open. 
</P>
<P>
New York 109, Miami 90 -- A good way to end a slump is to score 20 consecutive 
points. The Knicks did that in the second quarter at New York, built a big lead 
and coasted to their first victory under new Coach John MacLeod after three 
defeats. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks were leading, 33-24, when Patrick Ewing led the Knicks' charge. They 
had a 53-24 lead before the Heat made a free throw on an illegal-defense call. 
</P>
<P>
By halftime the lead was 55-29 and the Heat was never able to make a game of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 119, Orlando 114 -- Hersey Hawkins scored from long range and Rick 
Mahorn did the job in close at Orlando to enable the 76ers to stretch their 
winning streak to four games. 
</P>
<P>
Hawkins scored 27 points, making five of six three-point shots, and Mahorn 
scored nine of his 18 in the last quarter to thwart a Magic rally. 
</P>
<P>
Mahorn's three-point play on a driving layup gave the 76ers a 110-104 lead with 
1:41 left. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley had 28 points and nine rebounds for the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 128, Washington 125 -- In a game involving two of the four players 
averaging more than 29 points, the Bullets' Bernard King outscored Orlando 
Woolridge, 34-33, at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets, coming from behind in the last 2 1/2 minutes, won back-to-back 
games for the first time this season and improved to 5-15. 
</P>
<P>
Blair Rasmussen, the 7-foot center, made a 19-foot shot and an 18-foot shot in 
the last 95 seconds to play a key roll in the victory. He had 24 points and 13 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 135, Golden State 117 -- The Malones combined for 78 points at Salt Lake 
City and the Jazz won for the 10th time in the past 11 games. Jeff had 43 
points and Karl had 35. DAN HAFNER

PERFECT WITHOUT PRACTICE, VANDERBILT'S GRANT BEATS NO. 11 GEORGIA, 75-74 
</P>

Steve Grant thought the time was right to launch the first three-point shot of 
his career. And when his 26-foot jump shot connected with one second remaining 
in overtime, it gave Vanderbilt a 75-74 upset victory over previously unbeaten 
and 11th-ranked Georgia in the Southeastern Conference game at Nashville, Tenn. 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Grant has never taken a three-point shot in practice and never will," 
Vanderbilt Coach Eddie Fogler said. "That was helter-skelter. We were just 
trying to find an open man before they got set." 
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt (4-3) sent the game into overtime on two free throws by Bruce Elder 
with 25 seconds left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia (5-1) tried a desperation full-court pass with one second left, but 
Elder intercepted the ball at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 Arkansas 101, South Alabama 91 -- Todd Day had 20 of his 26 points in the 
second half to lead the Razorbacks at Fayetteville, Ark., in a game that was 
delayed an hour when the officials didn't show up. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas (8-1) never trailed and led by as many as 13 points during the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Mayberry added 25 points for Arkansas. Marvin Eackles led the South Alabama 
(4-1) with 18 points and Bobby Curtis added 17. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas said officials from the Sun Belt Conference, of which South Alabama is 
a member, were scheduled to work the game but either were not assigned or did 
not show up. 
</P>
<P>
A call went out in the area for officials and the game was worked by Mike Fox, 
a Southwest Conference official, and Johnny Gabbard, a local high school 
official. 
</P>
<P>
No. 14 St. John's 57, Brooklyn College 47 -- Freshman Shawnelle Scott, starting 
for one of two suspended St. John's players, scored 20 points as the Redman 
hung on for a narrow victory at New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Redmen (7-0) were playing without senior forward Billy Singleton and junior 
guard Chucky Sproling, who were suspended for the game by the school for 
failure to adhere to athletic department academic rules and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
REGIONAL HIGHLIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
EAST 
</P>
<P>
Boston College 80, Providence 78 -- Free throws by Gerrod Abram and David 
Hinton in the final minute of play lifted the Eagles over the visiting Friars 
in the Big East opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
The free throws offset a late rush by Providence's Eric Murdock, who scored a 
career-high 34 points, including seven consecutive free throws in the final 77 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Boston College (7-1) ended a four-game, two-year Friar winning streak against 
the Eagles. It was only the Eagles' third victory over Providence in the last 
11 games. 
</P>
<P>
Providence (6-1) was playing without three starters, who were suspended as the 
result of a brawl in a Friar victory over Rhode Island Saturday. Corey Floyd, 
Ken McDonald and Marvin Saddler were suspended for three games each. 
</P>
<P>
MIDWEST 
</P>
<P>
Orlando Stewart scored the final seven points for St. Louis, including a 
three-point shot with 36 seconds left, and two free throws with 15 seconds 
remaining to lift the Billikens to a 64-60 victory over Santa Clara at St. 
Louis. . . . Northern Iowa ended a two-game losing streak with a 68-62 victory 
over Iowa State, for its first victory over the Cyclones in 14 games. Iowa 
State lost for the eighth time in a row, its worst start in 15 years. . . . 
Carl Hayes scored 21 points to help Nebraska beat Wisconsin, 75-63, at Madison, 
Wis. 
</P>
<P>
WEST 
</P>
<P>
Dion Brown scored 27 points and had 10 rebounds as Washington beat Nevada, 
64-60, at Reno. The Huskies are 6-0. . . . Neil Derrick scored 24 points as 
Washington State overcame a sluggish start in a 101-65 victory over Cal State 
Sacramento at Pullman, Wash. The Cougars are 2-2.

LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING: MARYLAND BEATS UC IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Mulligan and his UC Irvine team know how hard a victory can be to come by, 
after getting only five all last season. 
</P>
<P>
That's why the Anteaters' 93-79 loss before 7,263 in Cole Field House at 
College Park, Md., Tuesday was so painful. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a 14-point game on paper," Mulligan said. "It wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine (3-4) might have turned the tables on a Maryland team that had lost 
three games in a row. Instead, the Anteaters fell below .500 after making only 
37% of their shots, and only 14 of 46 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Irvine trailed by only 81-77 with 2:23 to play. But Maryland's Kevin 
McLinton made a layup despite being fouled by Jeff Herdman. McLinton completed 
the three-point play with 1:44 remaining, and Maryland (3-3) made nine of 10 
free throws the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Terrapin center Cedric Lewis had 21 points, 14 rebounds and eight blocked 
shots. Walt Williams, a 6-foot-8 point guard, also scored 21 points, making 
seven of 10 shots. 
</P>
<P>
For the second game in a row, Irvine was also hurt by the slow start of senior 
center RickyButler. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, averaging 19 points, stumbled through the first half. He finished with 
18 points and nine rebounds, but had only four points at halftime. He had only 
three at halftime in a loss to Utah Saturday, and finished with 23. 
</P>
<P>
Herdman, who scored seven points in the final five minutes against Maryland as 
the Anteaters cut the deficit to four, finished with 18 and had eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine played its second game in a row without starting guard Dylan Rigdon, who 
was sidelined because of a hip injury. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine led, 20-12, in the first half before Maryland went on an 11-0 run. 
Maryland led by five at halftime and pulled out to a 13-point lead with 10 
minutes to play after a 15-2 run that included eight consecutive points by the 
Terrapins, who attempted 31 fewer shots than Irvine but made 59%.

PLAYERS FLY TO PRO BOWL ON AIR WAVES; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: SOME SAY PUBLIC RELATIONS CAN BE MORE IMPORTANT TO GOING TO 
ALL-STAR GAME THAN GOOD STATISTICS.

<P>
It's not so much who you know, but who knows you. 
</P>
<P>
Raiders' defensive end Greg Townsend forced a pair of fumbles against Detroit 
Monday night, and ABC-TV's high-profile broadcasting crew all but purchased 
Townsend's plane ticket to the Pro Bowl with unabashed praise. 
</P>
<P>
You want to go to Hawaii -- all expenses paid by the NFL -- you need national 
TV exposure, publicity and stats. 
</P>
<P>
Now if you play for the Chargers, you watch Monday Night Football. The last 
time the Chargers played on Monday night, Don Coryell was the head coach. 
</P>
<P>
The past two years, however, defensive lineman Lee Williams has had the stats 
to capture the attention of his voting peers. He had 11 sacks in 1988 and went 
to Hawaii and then had 14 in 1989 to earn a return visit. 
</P>
<P>
But Williams has been moved from defensive end to defensive tackle, and he no 
longer has the stats, and if you don't have the stats, then you better get the 
pub. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that hurts Lee is the fact that our organization hasn't pushed 
him for the Pro Bowl," linebacker Leslie O'Neal said. "You look at Charles Mann 
with Washington, for example. The organization pushed Charles Mann. 
</P>
<P>
"He was going to the Pro Bowl with only three or four sacks, but the 
organization was telling everybody he was the best player on the team and he 
was doing things to open it up for other players to have the stats. That's a 
public relations thing, and a coaching staff thing. Howie Long has gotten that 
push, that same type of recognition with the Raiders." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said he doesn't care about publicity anymore, and said he does not 
expect to earn a third trip to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that the two years that I was voted in, it wasn't because of any 
superlative effort by our P.R. department," Williams said. "I got in there 
because of what I did on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"I think certain people here get accorded more attention in the press than 
others for whatever reasons. I wouldn't say it's ability. You can't pick up a 
paper without seeing certain names in it." 
</P>
<P>
Based on experience, though, the Chargers' public relations department has 
always appeared to be an equal opportunity propaganda pusher. 
</P>
<P>
"It s too bad he took it public instead of going to the organization first to 
talk about it," Bill Johnston, director of public relations, said. "Our job is 
to promote the team, 50-some odd players on the team. We treat everyone the 
same, there's no preferential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here to help promote every player as much as they are willing to help us 
promote them. But winning is the best promotion." 
</P>
<P>
And maybe defeat fuels frustration. Although O'Neal is expected to be selected 
to the Pro Bowl in next week's balloting among players and coaches, he said 
he's unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of how we do the rest of the season, I'm angry," he said. "It's a 
team thing. Dallas is 1-15 last year and they are 6-7 this year, like us, and 
in one year they've turned it around and may make the playoffs. We've been 
going at it four or five years with this youth thing. 
</P>
<P>
"We've already lost this year. Maybe we go 8-8 or even 9-7, but there's only an 
outside chance at the playoffs. I look at next year and who's going to put us 
on national television?" 
</P>
<P>
If the Chargers spend each Monday night in front of their TVs, O'Neal said, the 
players will have to rely on the organization's help to achieve individual 
acclaim. And he said the Chargers have their favorites, players they choose to 
promote, "and they aren't always the best players. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe that's the relationship certain players have with the team," O'Neal 
said. "Maybe the organization wants certain people to go to the Pro Bowl and 
others not to go. You have to ask those questions, but who in their right mind 
will give you a truthful answer? How many people will be up front with you?" 
</P>
<P>
Safety Martin Bayless said O'Neal might be more outspoken than the rest of his 
teammates, but "he can do that because he's untouchable. But what he's saying 
is something many of us feel. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes what happens here is that they mention certain players who they 
think should be Pro Bowl players. But a guy cannot be a Pro Bowl player if he's 
hurt six or seven weeks out of the season. There are some players in the 
organization that they continue to push regardless of how they play. That's 
been a problem amongst the players." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal cited an example of one present-day Charger who has been given the big 
P.R. push, but after reconsidering, retracted the identity of the player. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to make any waves and be a distraction to this team," he said, 
"but there again I got to look at the fact if Lee Williams doesn't go to the 
Pro Bowl, then there's something wrong. I respect Lee as a player, more than I 
do a lot of other people on this team. There are a lot of people getting more 
publicity than Lee is getting, and you know who they are. 
</P>
<P>
"Gill Byrd hasn't gotten pushed. You don't see the stories on him. You don't 
see his name in USA Today the day before a game when they talk about who's hot 
or key matchups." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal said players such as Williams, Byrd, Bayless and linebacker Henry 
Rolling have not been afforded the same attention as some other players with 
less ability. 
</P>
<P>
He said he wouldn't say it's a racially motivated problem, because, "I'm a 
black player and I've gotten publicity. But there again what if it were 
different, and I had accomplished the things I've accomplished? I don't know 
what might have happened then." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal has understood the power of publicity since the day he arrived in the 
NFL. And if no one else will talk about his accomplishments, he will. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in this organization since '86," he said. "They didn't play defense 
here. You can talk about Billy Ray Smith, you can talk about Gill Byrd and all 
those other guys, but they didn't play defense well. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy Ray has been so popular because he was the best player on the defense, 
but who did they beat defensively back in those times? I see the game balls 
back in Doc (Brooks, equipment manager's) office with the defense getting a 
game ball in the (1985) Pittsburgh game where the score is 54 to 44. That's 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Byrd smiled; that's Leslie O'Neal, he said. He has heard his pronouncements and 
more than once he has advised O'Neal to hold his counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Now if there is someone who has the right to be miffed about missed 
opportunities, it's Gill Byrd. Byrd had seven interceptions in 1988 to lead all 
AFC corners and failed to win Pro Bowl attention. Ditto in 1989, and now here 
he is again in 1990 with seven interceptions to lead all defenders in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if this publicity thing is so much favoritism or just 
marketability," Byrd said. "Some guys are more marketable than other guys, so 
you want to get those guys out to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"A Burt Grossman is more marketable than a Gill Byrd not because Burt Grossman 
is a white defensive lineman, but because Burt Grossman says what's on his 
mind. He gets people's attention." 
</P>
<P>
Winning also gets attention. The Chargers have had 11 players selected to play 
in the Pro Bowl in the past six losing years. They had seven players picked in 
1982 when they last made an appearance in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Winning gets big-time attention. It brings national TV exposure, enhances stats 
and brings so much publicity to players that some begin to complain.

Bill Walsh says he plans to wait until after the NFL playoffs to decide whether 
to stay in broadcasting or return to football, but the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
would be his top choice if he chooses the latter. 
</P>
<P>
"If I pick a team to sign with, Tampa Bay would be at the top of my list," 
Walsh told the St. Petersburg Times on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's a lot that would have to occur before we finalized something." 
</P>
<P>
However, there is other interest in Walsh. The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer quoted 
unidentified sources as saying three teams have contacted the former 49er 
coach, possibly including the Rams. Tampa Bay and Cleveland were the other 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper did not elaborate on potential interest from the Rams. Walsh has 
seven games left on his two-year contract with NBC as a football analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Although not in a hurry to make a decision about his future, Walsh thinks Tampa 
Bay could be a good opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"I have great respect for (owner) Hugh Culverhouse and great respect for the 
whole organization," Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
"I also think Tampa Bay can become competitive and real contenders in that 
division (NFC Central) right away. It's just a matter of me looking into 
whether I want to leave the San Francisco area at this stage of my life. That 
would be the prime consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said he has not talked directly with Culverhouse, but that he has had two 
conversations with San Francisco owner Eddie DeBartolo and 49ers president 
Carmen Policy about the Buccaneers' coaching vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
He said Culverhouse had asked DeBartolo and Policy to present Tampa Bay's 
position in preliminary discussions. 
</P>
<P>
"Like I said, there's a lot that would have to happen before we finalized 
anything," Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland owner Art Modelll would not comment on the situation.

BATT-RAPP MAKING SURE THE BEAT GOES ON FOR TRITON BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Directed by Tom Marshall -- no relation to Garry or Penny -- Batt -- Rapp at UC 
San Diego is drawing rave reviews around the nation and rising in the charts. 
</P>
<P>
But don't get the wrong idea. This is not a play or the dynamic duo doing a 
song-and-dance routine, and you have not picked up the Calendar section by 
mistake. This is men's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Batt and Rapp -- Rick and Tim, respectively -- are basketball players. Marshall 
is the coach. 
</P>
<P>
Together and with the help of a strong supporting cast, they have UCSD off to 
its best start ever at 6-0 and a No. 3 ranking among the nation's Division III 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Coming off a best-ever 20-7 record, which included two losses to Division I 
teams, UCSD, a team with zero seniors last year, expected to have a good 
season, but the quick start has taken even Marshall by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we expected to be no worse than 4-2," Marshall said. "But 6-0? 
We've played even better than I thought we would." 
</P>
<P>
Included in the 6-0 record are back-to-back championships at the UCSD Tip-off 
Tournament and the Redlands Tournament. Batt and Rapp have been exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
Batt, a 6-7 junior, finished third in the nation last year with a .663 shooting 
percentage. This year, he's at .711. 
</P>
<P>
Rapp, a 6-foot-4 senior guard, is averaging 26 points per game, up two from his 
team-leading average a year ago. Since his sophomore year, Rapp has played in 
seven tournaments and has made the all-tournament team all seven times, 
including four times as the most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing about the team that I'm most pleased about is the bench play," 
Marshall said. "I think we're getting better play from them from an efficiency 
standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
After a week and a half layoff for final examinations, the show resumes at 7 
tonight against La Verne in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Missing the mark: U.S. International, which once led the nation in scoring and 
has a goal of scoring at least 100 points in every game, has done it only one 
time in eight games this season. That time was Saturday, but the Gulls (1-7) 
still lost, 114-104, to Chico State. 
</P>
<P>
Strangely, USIU's lone victory came on the road, where the Gulls had lost 17 
straight. That was 72-67 over Campbell in the Cardinal Varsity Club tournament 
in Muncie, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
The big reason for the lack of scoring -- USIU is averaging only 79.8 points 
per game as opposed to 97.8 last year -- is that only one player, Isaac Brown, 
is shooting above 50% from the field. Brown, a sophomore guard, is making 55.7% 
of his shots. The next highest is senior forward Kevin Bradshaw at 42%. 
</P>
<P>
Hitting the mark: Gary Litten, a junior forward on the Point Loma Nazarene 
men's basketball team, leads the NAIA District 3 in field-goal percentage at 
.941. Litten, a 6-3 junior forward, has missed only one of 17 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Litten and 6-6 junior forward Donnie Buettner, who is averaging 19.3 points and 
12 rebounds per game, are two reasons PLNC has a new outlook. 
</P>
<P>
Last year after six games, PLNC was 1-5 and staring at an 8-21 season. This 
year, the Crusaders are 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
Hitting and missing: University of San Diego guard Geoff Probst has made six of 
nine three-point shots this year, but is zero for seven from the free-throw 
line. 
</P>
<P>
USD forward Kelvin Woods is three for three from three, but has missed seven of 
his last 10 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Two out of three isn't bad: Punctuating its best season in history, the 
University of San Diego men's soccer program took two of the three highest 
postseason honors in the West Coast Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Seamus McFadden was named coach of the year as the Toreros finished 16-3-5 and 
advanced to the semifinals of the NCAA West Region playoffs, where they lost to 
eventual champion UCLA, 2-1 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Senior sweeper Trong Nguyen was named the WCC's defensive player of the year. 
Nguyen, a three-time first team all-WCC selection, sparked a defense that 
allowed fewer than a goal per game this season. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara's Jeff Balcher was the offensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Also named to the first team from USD were junior forward Paul Gelvezon (12 
goals, seven assists), sophomore forward Chugger Adair (eight goals, nine 
assists) and senior midfielder Tom Crane (six goals, seven assists). 
</P>
<P>
Senior midfielder Leo Ronces, freshman midfielder Toby Taitano and freshman 
goalie Tom Tate were named to the second team. 
</P>
<P>
Thou shalt steal: The San Diego Mesa women's basketball team set a school 
record for steals last week with 42 in a 76-38 rout of San Bernardino Valley. 
The old record was 38 set in the 1984-85 season. 
</P>
<P>
Sorii Epps had a game-high 12 steals, which tied Mesa's record set in 1978 by 
Tami Inabinett. Epps also scored 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
Forgive them: One would think a school named St. Mary's would get this right. 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Tavares, a freshman guard from Our Lady of Peace, is listed as having 
played for Our Lady of Angels in the WCC women's basketball media guide.

PHILLIPS STAYING OUT

<P>
Charger nose tackle Joe Phillips has received medical clearance to return to 
practice, but because of a salary dispute, has stayed away from San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium since late last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ready for Joe to practice. I'm ready to practice him when the doctors 
and Joe think that is the thing to do," Coach Dan Henning said. "And it was my 
understanding that both those parties agreed to that. What's the holdup? It has 
something to do with money." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips was the team's starting nose tackle in the first three games, but 
suffered a beating outside a Mission Bay restaurant on Sept. 26th. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Bobby Beathard said Phillips received full payment for seven 
games, although the club was not obligated to pay him beyond the fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
"I've checked around the league and a lot of teams are not paying players on 
the reserve/non-football injury list at all," Beathard said. "In Washington it 
was our policy to pay 50 percent, although we gave Kelvin Bryant only one-third 
of his salary because he was making so much. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time Joe was hurt, I told him we would pay him. But then it came time 
where we examined the situation and decided to take another look. There were 
other things involved that I can't go into. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted Joe to come back to practice, and if ready to go, he could be 
activated for the last three games and receive three more paychecks. Right now 
we're still discussing everything with his lawyers and we're trying to find a 
way to get him on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips has received more than $150,000 from the club to date for this season, 
but is apparently unwilling to start practicing until he receives full pay for 
the past 13 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
After recovering from a fractured eye orbit that required extensive surgery, 
Phillips had rejoined the Chargers and had begun lifting weights. However, club 
officials said he stopped appearing for workouts at the stadium late last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I spoke to Joe (Monday)," Henning said. "I told him I think that it needs to 
be resolved, and he said he's trying. And I've talked to our people and they're 
trying." 
</P>
<P>
Representives for Phillips were to be in contact with Beathard Tuesday night, 
but Henning said he doesn't think a settlement between parties is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive line coach Gunther Cunningham, who moved to the United States from 
Munich, Germany at the age of 12, has been approached by the World Football 
League as a head-coaching candidate for the league's Frankfurt franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm flattered they would consider me," Cunningham said. "I've talked to them 
and they're very interested. They would like me to go there, but we're in the 
middle of something here and I told them I would talk later." 
</P>
<P>
The WFL is expected to begin play in March, and league officials said it has 
been searching for coaches who have the ability to speak foreign languages. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had to, I could speak German," Cunningham said. "I'm interested, but I 
can only focus on one thing at a time, and right now that's to beat Denver."

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: END OF KENNEDY GIRLS' AMAZING LEAGUE WIN STREAK BECAME 
INEVITABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Granada Hills High's 61-55 victory over Kennedy in a Northwest Valley 
Conference girls' basketball opener Monday snapped the Golden Cougars' 
league/conference winning streak at 140 games, but Granada Hills Coach Carolyn 
Gunny was not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
Gunny, who has coached the Highlanders for 13 seasons, said that the end of 
Kennedy's streak -- which began in 1976 -- had been past due for a couple of 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been on the decline for a few years now, and we just finally caught up 
with them," Gunny said about the Golden Cougars, who are 0-4 this season. "They 
don't have the team they've had in the past and we've got a pretty good team." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Kennedy's recent wane, Gunny was concerned that her players might let 
Kennedy's streak affect their play. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them to play with their heads and not their hearts," said Gunny, who 
guided Granada Hills to the City Section 3-A Division title in 1983. "I wanted 
them to do a little thinking upstairs and not get all emotional about possibly 
ending the streak." 
</P>
<P>
Add Kennedy: Craig Raub, who coached the Kennedy girls' team from 1978-87 and 
won City 4-A titles in 1981 and '87, said that although the Golden Cougars' 
streak was listed at 140 games, it might have been longer. 
</P>
<P>
"I could only find records back through the (1976-'77) season," Raub said. "I 
think they won two or three league games at the end of the previous season, but 
I could never prove it." 
</P>
<P>
A few pointers: The Granada Hills boys' team (6-1) is averaging 85 points a 
game, proving that the Highlanders have picked up where they left off last 
season, despite the loss of All-City Section point guard Jermoine Brantley. 
</P>
<P>
The assumption is half-correct. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the team is already flying high, but there is no replacement for 
Brantley. In fact, there is no point guard at all. 
</P>
<P>
"At the present time, we have no point guard," Coach Bob Johnson said. "There 
is no designated point guard. The position does not exist. Whoever finds 
himself with the ball brings it up the floor." 
</P>
<P>
More often than not, forward Jerry Allen, who at 6-foot-4 is the team's tallest 
player, draws the assignment. After carting the ball upcourt, Allen -- who is 
averaging 22 points, 12 rebounds and five assists a game -- moves down to his 
forward position. 
</P>
<P>
So while Allen may not be replacing Brantley, per se, he is doing a pretty fair 
imitation. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a player averaging more than he is in those three categories," 
Johnson said of Allen. "Even Brantley, because he never had that many 
rebounds." 
</P>
<P>
Slopsided: Running and running it up are two different things, and first-year 
Cleveland Coach Kevin Crider says he does not want to be accused of 
orchestrating the latter. 
</P>
<P>
In last week's 106-56 win over Jefferson, Crider had to call off the dogs early 
-- in the first quarter, in fact. As Cleveland jumped to a 24-2 lead, Jefferson 
managed to cross the half-court line once during that span, Crider said. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'My gosh, this is ugly,' " he said. "I had to call (the press) off. 
I was yelling to the kids to stop, but they didn't, so I had to call time. We 
even went into a zone." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland hardly zoned out, though. Cleveland led at one point, 34-6, even 
though Crider had already started clearing the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Discharged: Chatsworth's hopes of climbing from last to first place in the West 
Valley League were dealt a blow when four players left the team last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth Coach Gary Shair, who would not discuss the particulars of the mass 
defection, said only that the players left "by mutual agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Included among the players were starting point guard Kay Lee and sixth man John 
Paul Labrador. Lee and Labrador were averaging 2.5 and 12.5 points a game, 
respectively, for the Chancellors (2-3), whom many coaches picked as a 
contender for the league title. 
</P>
<P>
Combined, the four players were averaging nearly 29 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth was 3-16 overall, 0-10 in league play last season. 
</P>
<P>
Doings at the 'Dale: Palmdale's basketball team entered the 1990-91 season 
touted by most coaches as the Golden League favorite. After all, with returning 
big men Jason Grimes (6-foot-7) and Chris DeGlopper (6-foot-5), the Falcons had 
size, experience and talent like few other league rivals. 
</P>
<P>
But talent on paper doesn't always translate to victories. Palmdale fell flat 
out of the gate, losing to Hart, 79-69, and Golden League rival Saugus, 62-57, 
in the Saugus Shootout. Coach Garry Phelps worried about his guard play, so 
necessary, he felt, to take the pressure off his big men. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with adversity, Palmdale responded in a big way. The Falcons won four in 
a row and swept their way to last weekend's Crescenta Valley tournament title, 
beating Ventura, Venice and Beverly Hills. Grimes was named tournament most 
valuable player after grabbing 15 rebounds in the final and point guard Jason 
Rose scored 16 points in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the tournament title is believed to be the first for Palmdale. 
Phelps has been at the school 20 years and said that the Crescenta Valley 
trophy is the first of its kind for the Falcon trophy case. 
</P>
<P>
"After Saugus, the kids were a little disappointed," Phelps said. "But we're 
coming around now." 
</P>
<P>
Streak end: Santa Clara's venerable Lou Cvijanovich is the coach of the 
two-time defending state champion. His teams had fashioned a 45-game win streak 
entering the 1990-91 season. Four games into the season, Santa Barbara snapped 
the streak at 48 with a 63-57 win over the Saints in the final of the Simi 
Valley tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Cvijanovich's reaction? Did he heave a chair across the hardwood floor? Did he 
tear up the Simi Valley locker room with his bare hands? Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
"It never bothered me," Cvijanovich said of the streak. "The streak never fazed 
me one bit. I never worried about it. The way I see it, streaks are meant to be 
broken. It just doesn't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
Thumbed: Simi Valley forward Danny Alexander had his shooting hand placed in a 
cast last week, one week after he fractured his thumb during practice. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, a 6-foot-5 junior, played in the Simi Valley tournament despite the 
injury. But a further examination disclosed the fracture and he will miss at 
least two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Lock Smith: Hueneme sophomore guard Tony Smith has averaged 20.3 points a game 
and has a high of 28. He was named to the All-Nordhoff tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
"He's played really well," Coach Howard Davis said. "It's safe to say I'm 
pretty surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Early vacation: Camarillo (3-1), which finished second in the Saugus Shootout 
two weeks ago, will not play again until the Ventura tournament on Dec. 21. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first saw the schedule, I was disappointed," first-year Coach Mike 
Prewitt said. "But I guess it will give us two weeks to work on some of the 
things that we have to work on." 
</P>
<P>
Add vacation: After an 0-2 start, Burroughs has won three out of the past four 
games and won the consolation championship of the Crescenta Valley tournament 
on Saturday with an 89-44 victory over Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
However, Burroughs will have a 10-day layoff until playing Glendale on Dec. 18. 
"Everybody is still optimistic and has positive vibes," Coach Ira Sollod said. 
</P>
<P>
T is for turnaround: Sure, it's early, but Reseda (2-3) has already experienced 
its share of roller-coaster rides. 
</P>
<P>
On the high side, the Regents pulled off a 72-64 upset at Kennedy on Monday. 
Earlier in the season, Reseda rallied from a 20-point deficit before falling to 
Hamilton in double overtime. 
</P>
<P>
And then there was last Friday's come-from-ahead loss to Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
After Reseda took a four-point lead with less than a minute remaining, Wilson 
called time out. After huddling, Wilson inbounded the ball with, according to 
Reseda Coach Jeff Halpern, a distinct advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"They had six guys on the floor," Halpern said. "We were screaming to the refs, 
but by the time Wilson got to the other end of the court, the extra guy was off 
the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Halpern said a Wilson player scored to pare the lead to two and was fouled in 
the process. What's more, the Reseda bench was immediately hit with a technical 
foul. A technical should have been assessed to Wilson for having an additional 
player on the floor.

"As soon as the ball went through the basket, the referee turned and nailed us 
with a T for yelling," Halpern said. 
</P>
<P>
After the officials decided there had indeed been six Wilson players on the 
floor, the technical foul against Reseda was waved off, Halpern said. But the 
tailspin had already begun: Reseda fell, 58-54.

Frustrations: Camp Kilpatrick's 13-7 loss to Montclair Prep in the Southern 
Section Division X football title game Friday was particularly frustrating to 
Camp Kilpatrick Coach Sean Porter. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the Mustangs fumble away a punt with 2 minutes 10 seconds left, 
but they also fumbled the ball to Montclair Prep after Rayford Watts' key 
interception with 8:32 left. 
</P>
<P>
Porter could only stand and watch as the ball slowly bounced five yards toward 
him on the sideline and into the hands of Montclair Prep's Shad Knighton. 
</P>
<P>
Porter turned to an assistant and shook his head. "Man, you don't know how bad 
I wanted to kick that thing the other way," Porter said with a grin.

SAN FERNANDO ADDS TEAMS TO ITS BASEBALL TOURNAMENT 
</P>

San Fernando High's preseason baseball tournament has been expanded to eight 
teams and may add more teams in the spring of 1992, according to Tiger Coach 
Steve Marden. 
</P>
<P>
The spring tournament, in its second season, will include City Section teams 
Grant, Birmingham, Granada Hills, Kennedy, Narbonne, Franklin, Poly and San 
Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
The inaugural Tiger Invitational featured a six-team field, and Marden said 
that, based on feedback, he may expand the tournament to 10 or 12 teams in 
1992. Marden said coaches like the fact that the tournament lasts just eight 
days, rather than continuing over several consecutive weekends and into the 
regular-season schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes in those tournaments, you end up using a second baseman or an 
outfielder on the hill," Marden said. "Nobody wants to use their best pitcher 
when they might have an important league game coming up. This tournament 
doesn't drag on forever." 
</P>
<P>
Each team is guaranteed four games in the tournament, which runs Feb. 20, 21, 
26 and 28. Also, area teams have been guaranteed that they will not face a 
league opponent. San Fernando, which was 3-0-1 in tournament play last season, 
is the defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
Marden said that a handful of Southern Section teams from the area inquired 
about entering but are prohibited from playing until March 7. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament could help fill the void created when the Thousand Oaks 
tournament folded over the summer. STEVE ELLING

WASHINGTON BLANKETS RECORD BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Khalid Ali was, by all accounts, a darn good running back during his two-year 
tenure at Granada Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
He set a slew of rushing records in 1985 and '86. Entering the season, in fact, 
Ali's name appeared in the Highlander record book 10 times as the owner of 
various career or single-game marks. 
</P>
<P>
Yet with a record-busting senior season, Brett Washington has rendered Ali a 
football footnote, blotting his name completely out of the team record book. 
Washington, a 6-foot, 225-pound fullback, has 14 school records, surprising 
even himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought about breaking records," Washington said. "I'm kind of 
shocked." 
</P>
<P>
So were most of Granada Hills' opponents, against whom Washington routinely 
rolled up big numbers. The following is a compendium of Washington's 
pandemonium. Listed parenthetically are the former marks and the name of the 
previous record-holder/victim: 
</P>
<P>
* Longest run from scrimmage, a 93-yard dive play during a 48-7 victory over 
Compton earlier this season (Kurt Schumacher, 89 yards against Bell, 1974). 
</P>
<P>
* Single-game rushing total of 252 yards against Compton (Ali, 218 yards 
against Westlake, 1986). 
</P>
<P>
* Single-game point total of 30 against Compton (Greg Fowble, 28 points against 
Van Nuys, 1985). 
</P>
<P>
* Single-game touchdowns with five against Compton (Ali, four against Westlake, 
1986). 
</P>
<P>
* Single-season rushing total of 1,638 yards in 1990 (Ali, 1,370 yards in 
1986). 
</P>
<P>
* Single-season rushing touchdowns with 22 in 1990 (Ali, 18 in 1986). 
</P>
<P>
* Single-season points with 146 in 1990 (Ali, 120 in 1986). 
</P>
<P>
* Single-season total touchdowns with 24 in 1990 (Ali, 20 in 1986). 
</P>
<P>
* Career rushing total of 3,410 yards from 1987-90 (Ali, 2,062 yards). 
</P>
<P>
* Career touchdowns with 49 (Ali, 26 touchdowns). 
</P>
<P>
* Career rushing touchdowns with 43 (Ali, 24). 
</P>
<P>
* Career points with 296 (Fowble, 187 points, 1984-85). 
</P>
<P>
* Career rushing average of 7.4 yards (Ali, 6.8 yards). 
</P>
<P>
Lest Washington feel guilty about erasing Ali from the book, he can take solace 
in the fact that he did in himself as well. His 14th record? 
</P>
<P>
* Single-season rushing average of 9.3 yards a carry in 1990 (Brett Washington, 
7.5 yards in 1989). 
</P>
<P>
Defense: The 378 passing yards surrendered by Granada Hills in its 57-13 loss 
to Carson was virtually half (49.7%) of the yards allowed in the team's 
previous 11 games (761). It was likewise with the point total -- Granada Hills 
had yielded just 118 points entering the Carson game. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball: Nordhoff has some pretty good players in Tim and Mark Sebek, sons 
of Coach Dick Sebek. Junior Tim scored 26 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in a 
win over Carpinteria and scored 31 points with 10 rebounds in a win over Santa 
Ynez. In Nordhoff's only loss, freshman Mark outscored his older brother, 
18-14, in an 80-68 loss to Channel Islands. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Quartz Hill guard Chris Young has paced the Rebels to a 5-0 start. The 6-foot 
senior has scored 30, 26, 26, 24 and 14 points for an average of 24 points a 
game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Village Christian's 6-foot-7 center John Brown, seventh among area scorers last 
season, is having little trouble getting back into the flow of things. Brown 
averaged 31 points a game in the Crusaders' first five games, including a 
46-point effort in an overtime win over Salesian. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen Harvard players scored in a 113-38 victory over Glendale Academy and 
11 Burroughs players scored in an 89-44 win over Murphy. Harvard scored 63 
points in the first half of an 87-57 win over Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous: Canyon point guard Lance Moore played 35 minutes, tied a school 
record with 14 assists and committed no turnovers in Canyon's 84-83 overtime 
loss to Hart two weeks ago. The Cowboys enjoyed revenge on Monday night, 
thumping Hart, 89-65 in the Indians' gym. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Hart tied a 1968 school record by attempting 53 free throws in a 71-62 victory 
over Amador Valley, making 34 to break the previous mark of 33. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Paraclete has been the beneficiary of a technical foul in each of its six 
games.

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: POLY'S CAMPBELL A HIT WITH 1ST IMPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barreling through a pile of players at the line of scrimmage has pleased Poly 
High running back Jonathan Campbell for years. But this season, it pleased the 
folks at Poly as well. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Campbell, who has rushed for nearly 2,000 yards, the Parrots have won 10 
of 13 games and reached the City Section 3-A Division championship game -- 
Poly's most successful season in 22 years. During Campbell's sophomore and 
junior seasons, the Parrots won only three of 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
In Friday's division semifinal, Campbell ran for 164 yards and three touchdowns 
in 29 carries to lift the Parrots past previously unbeaten Fairfax, 35-28. 
There was nothing fancy about Campbell's runs. In fact, they all looked 
strikingly similar as he took the ball from quarterback Lance Garcia and rammed 
up the middle, following senior lineman Eddie Moreno. 
</P>
<P>
On nearly every carry, several defenders had a shot at Campbell, but the 
5-foot-11, 185-pound senior rarely went down without a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way I played when we were little kids in the front yard," Campbell 
said. "The yard wasn't very big, so most of the time you had to run them over 
to get into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just the way I learned. You hit them first." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's goal at the beginning of the year was to rush for more than 1,300 
yards, which would have pushed him past the 3,000-yard mark in career rushing 
yardage. But Campbell passed that milestone several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
In 13 games, Campbell has rushed for 1,909 yards in 273 carries and scored 29 
touchdowns. He holds the school record with 3,664 career rushing yards, 
breaking the record of 3,120 yards set by Craig Ellis in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis now is a wide receiver for the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football 
League and was recently named the most valuable player of the CFL's Western 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell has made a believer of second-year Poly Coach Fred Cuccia, who says he 
wouldn't trade Campbell for any back in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of players with talent, but none like Campbell," Cuccia said. 
"He can do so many things." 
</P>
<P>
Another thing that Campbell can do -- and do well -- is play baseball. Last 
spring he batted .357 with 30 hits, 23 runs batted in, 14 stolen bases and 28 
runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
But it's his football statistics that have college recruiters calling. Colorado 
State is as interested in Campbell as he is in the school, says Campbell, who 
hopes to go to an out-of-state college. Hawaii and Washington State also have 
expressed interest, but Campbell will likely choose the school that will allow 
him to play two sports. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell plays sparingly on defense because Cuccia doesn't believe in two-way 
starters, but he is the holder on extra-point attempts -- many of which he sets 
up with goal-line plunges. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell scored three times on three-yard runs against Fairfax, including the 
winning score on a third-and-goal play with 1 minute 18 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"It was typical Jonathan Campbell. He does it week in and week out," Cuccia 
said, "Down on the goal line, he is tough to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell has become so accustomed to running up the middle that when he gets 
the call to run outside, he feels like he is running in slow motion. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel slow running up the middle because there are people in the way," 
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell admits that while he is tough to bring down, he is easy to catch. On 
his first carry against Fairfax, a Moreno block sprung Campbell for a 46-yard 
gain. Campbell was amazed when he found a hole so big that plowing wasn't 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"I went through the hole and just went around the corner. Of course they caught 
up to me like usual -- I'm used to that," he said with a laugh. "I'm not much 
for breakaway speed."

<P>
City Manager John Lockwood, who rose from mail clerk to the city's top 
administrator, said he will retire March 9, the day before he turns 60. 
</P>
<P>
After 37 years in city government, Lockwood became city manager in October, 
1986, after the forced resignation of Sylvester Murray, a nationally recognized 
administrator who clashed with the City Council. As a top administrator, 
Lockwood earned $126,372 annually and directed 9,000 employees and a 
$1.2-billion budget. One of Lockwood's top achievements was a major "customer 
service" effort in 1988 to improve contact with the public. The program cut red 
tape in the Building Inspection Department and put uniforms on Balboa Park 
employees.

The last of eastern Germany's trouble-ridden nuclear power plants will close 
this weekend on completion of a substitute oil-powered station, energy 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials will close the fourth and last reactor at the Greifswald plant, which 
once provided 10% of former Communist-ruled East Germany's energy needs but did 
not meet safety standards in the new united country. 
</P>
<P>
The other three reactors, as well as a smaller plant at Rheinsberg, closed 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Environment Ministry spokeswoman Monika Litwin said the new oil-powered station 
would come on line Saturday and take over the Greifswald area's heating and 
electricity needs.

FARMERS COULD BEAR THE BRUNT OF RATIONING 
</P>

Farmers will be among the hardest hit water users in eastern Ventura County by 
a mandatory rationing program approved Tuesday by the Metropolitan Water 
District of Southern California, which supplies five of the county's cities. 
</P>
<P>
The rationing plan calls for a 5% reduction in water use for overall 
residential consumption and a 20% cut for agricultural users in Simi Valley, 
Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Camarillo and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, which goes into effect Feb. 1, the price of water delivered to 
a city or agency will triple if the reduction quota is not met. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in four of the five Ventura County cities affected said they already 
have some conservation measures in place that have reduced their overall water 
consumption by 4% or more during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
They said they do not anticipate any problems in achieving the mandatory 
quotas. Officials in Oxnard said they only recently implemented voluntary water 
reduction measures and are uncertain what the effect has been. 
</P>
<P>
Among farmers, however, there was strong concern Tuesday that the cutbacks 
could have an economic impact. Although growers have already significantly 
reduced their demands for imported water by using more efficient irrigation 
systems, officials said it will be difficult for them to achieve a 20% 
reduction without taking drastic measures. 
</P>
<P>
Don Reeder, president of the Ventura County Farm Bureau, which represents about 
1,800 local farmers, said growers in the east county will undoubtedly be forced 
to cut out some of their crops. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pretty darn efficient right now," Reeder said. "There's very little left 
to cut. The biggest decision now is going to be what crops to eliminate." 
</P>
<P>
The MWD supplies the Calleguas Municipal Water District and several other water 
companies that distribute water to the five Ventura County cities that will be 
affected. Calleguas also supplies water to some unincorporated areas throughout 
the eastern county, such as Somis and areas surrounding Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
It is in these unincorporated regions where many of the agricultural users who 
rely on MWD water are located, said Reddy Pakala, an official with the Ventura 
County Water Resources Division, which oversees distribution of imported water 
to the Somis and Moorpark areas. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County Waterworks District 1, which includes Moorpark and areas to 
the north and west of the city, Pakala said there are about 88 agricultural 
users and 7,600 total customers. Growers in this area get about 75% of their 
water from MWD and 25% from wells. 
</P>
<P>
Since June, when the Ventura County Board of Supervisors approved mandatory 
water conservation measures for the three water districts overseen by the 
county, agricultural users have reduced their demands by about 12% to 15%, 
while there has been an overall 10% reduction in water consumption, Pakala 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Pakala warned that further cutbacks will be harder to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
"The farmers right now are using as little water as possible," he said. "Any 
additional cutbacks imposed on them from MWD will be hard for them to meet." 
Pakala agreed with Reed that some farmers might have to eliminate some of their 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County Waterworks District 19, which includes the Somis area, there 
are about 300 agricultural users and a total of about 1,000 customers, Pakala 
said. He said growers in this district get about 80% of their water from wells 
and the remaining 20% from MWD. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, ground water is also becoming more scarce and that these 
farmers will also be hit hard by the new reduction demands. 
</P>
<P>
Waterworks District 17, which encompasses the Bell Canyon area southeast of 
Simi Valley, is primarily residential and will not be affected as much as the 
other two county-run districts. 
</P>
<P>
Pakala said the mandatory conservation measures already in place include 
prohibiting the washing of sidewalks, driveways or other paved surfaces; the 
filling of fountains or ponds except with recycled water; serving water in 
restaurants unless requested; and watering lawns between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
For the first violation of any of these rules, customers receive a written 
notice. A $25 fine follows the second violation, and a $50 fine for a third. If 
further violations occur, the district can install water-flow restricting 
devices or possibly discontinue service. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Board of Supervisors recently approved a "tiered rate" structure as a 
way to achieve further cutbacks in water consumption in the three districts. 
Under the new rate structure, customers exceeding a certain amount of water per 
month must pay a surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, large water users in Thousand Oaks and Camarillo said they have also 
taken steps to conserve water and are ready to take more stringent actions. 
</P>
<P>
At the Las Posas Country Club near Camarillo, greenskeeper Pete Hernandez said 
operators have already reduced the amount of MWD water the golf course 
purchases and have switched to more well water. Hernandez said the golf course 
could withstand another demand to reduce water consumption by 5%. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure we could do that," he said. "I'm sure we could go to 10% less." 
</P>
<P>
Tex Ward, general manager of the Conejo Recreation and Parks District, said the 
31 parks in the city have already been planted with drought-resistant turf and 
outfitted with efficient irrigation systems. A reduction in water usage could 
mean turf will be allowed to die in some of the parks and play fields. 
</P>
<P>
"Things won't look as good, but we can keep things alive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Calleguas officials are scheduled to meet with representatives of each of the 
five Ventura County cities today to discuss details of the mandatory 
water-rationing program.

TWO MEXICAN OFFICIALS ARRESTED IN STING; 
</P>
<P>
BORDER: PAIR ALLEGEDLY ATTEMPTED TO BRIBE CALEXICO OFFICER TO OBTAIN THE NAME 
OF A BORDER PATROL AGENT WHO SHOT A YOUTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The case involving the Border Patrol shooting of a Mexican youth took an 
unusual twist Tuesday when Calexico police arrested two Mexican consular 
officials who allegedly attempted to bribe a police employee to learn the 
identity of the agent involved. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested the pair at a fast-food restaurant in El Centro at 2:20 p.m. 
Tuesday after authorities had arranged a "sting" in response to a bribe offer 
of $500 to $600, said Leslie Ginn, Calexico chief of police. The two, both 
employees of the Mexican consul's office in Calexico, were booked on suspicion 
of bribery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if this were Joe Blow off the street, he'd have gone to jail for bribery 
too," Ginn said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, Eduardo Garcia Zamores, 15, was shot Nov. 18 as he straddled the 
border fence between Calexico and Mexicali, the state capital of Baja 
California. The agent has contended that he fired because the youth was about 
to throw a rock. The youth, who is recovering from a wound to the right side of 
the torso, has denied throwing any rocks and says the shooting was unprovoked. 
Several witnesses have backed up his story. 
</P>
<P>
The case has triggered huge protests as well as charges and countercharges by 
investigators of each country against their counterparts across the border. The 
youth has also filed a $9-million negligence claim against the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the bribery allegation seems likely to escalate the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario began to unfold Monday, Ginn said, when a female Mexican consular 
official based in Calexico approached a female police employee and offered $500 
to $600 for the agent's name. Mexican officials want to extradite the agent, 
but have been unable to obtain his name from police or U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The police employee notified her superiors, Ginn said, and a decision was made 
to go ahead with a "meet" as part of a criminal bribery investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The two Mexican officials met Tuesday with the police employee at a Denny's 
restaurant in El Centro, said Ginn, who added that police had placed the scene 
under surveillance. The two Mexican officials allegedly handed over the cash, 
and the police worker gave them a piece of paper on which was written a name -- 
not the correct name of the Border Patrol agent, Ginn said. Then police moved 
in. 
</P>
<P>
"They were arrested on the spot, brought down and booked into our city jail," 
said Ginn, 58, who has headed the small department for 5.5 years after a 
29-year career as a San Diego police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were Ascension Martinez Pena, 46, the consulate's chancellor, or 
administrator, and Karla Elena Correa Ibarra, 27, a secretary. The latter is 
the suspect who made the initial contact with the police employee, Ginn said. 
Both were expected to be released on $5,000 bail late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The police chief said he believed neither of the two had diplomatic immunity, 
which is routinely accorded to many representatives of foreign governments. 
"The big shots in Washington are going to have to explain that to me," Ginn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Marco E. Lopez, the San Diego attorney who is representing them, said he 
believes both are shielded from arrest by diplomatic protection. 
</P>
<P>
Enrique Loaeza, the Mexican consul general in San Diego, declined to comment on 
the specifics of the case. But he said Mexican authorities would not engage in 
or condone criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
"The government of Mexico would not attempt to follow up on one crime by 
committing another crime," said Loaeza, whose responsibility includes the 
Mexican consular office in Calexico. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez said the two were "entrapped," and that Calexico police were motivated by 
vindictiveness toward Mexican officials -- charges denied by Ginn, the Calexico 
police chief. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Ginn has charged publicly that his investigation of the shooting of the 
Mexican boy is "at a standstill" because Mexican authorities have refused to 
provide him access to the boy and have otherwise impeded his inquiry. Mexican 
officials have denied the charge, contending that they have been cooperative.

LOCKWOOD TO RETIRE AS CITY MANAGER; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: THE 41-YEAR CIVIL SERVANT CITES A DESIRE TO ENJOY HIS LEISURE TIME 
-- AND A WEARINESS OF POLITICAL INFIGHTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego City Manager John Lockwood, the consummate behind-the-scenes 
bureaucrat who has quietly steered city government through four years of 
belt-tightening and occasional turbulence, announced Tuesday that he will 
retire March 9 after 41 years in city government. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood, who rose from a $142-a-month mail room messenger job to oversee a 
$1.2-billion city budget and a 9,000-member work force, announced his 
intentions to the City Council at the end of its weekly closed session, 
distributing wristwatches bearing the city seal to the eight council members 
and Mayor Maureen O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
"I had always planned to retire from city service in my 50s, and March 9 is my 
last chance," Lockwood said in a letter to the council. He will turn 60 the 
following day. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood attributed his decision to a desire to hold his post less than five 
years and to enjoy his financial security and leisure time. But, in a rare 
moment of candor, he acknowledged the toll that the deep divisions on the City 
Council have had on him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough on me," he said. "It's like being one of 10 children in a family. 
Your nine siblings treat you very well, but they beat up on each other every 
night at dinner. After a while, dinner's not that much fun anymore." 
</P>
<P>
The choice of Lockwood's successor -- and the very process by which he or she 
is selected -- could well become bogged down in the kind of factional 
infighting that has plagued the council over the past 12 months. Appointments 
to key city posts repeatedly have been the source of friction during that time. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor and her chief council antagonist, Deputy Mayor Bob Filner, immediately 
differed on the scope of the upcoming search. 
</P>
<P>
"We can do the search in this building," O'Connor said in an interview. "Mr. 
Lockwood left us with a first-class management team on whom we can draw for his 
replacement." She expressed concern about how long it would take for an 
outsider to learn the city. 
</P>
<P>
But Filner said he favors a national search for the new administrator, preceded 
by an extensive self-examination to clarify the city's priorities and the 
qualities it wants in its next manager. 
</P>
<P>
The city should "establish a selection process which can not only come up with 
a good person but bring this council together," Filner said. 
</P>
<P>
In either scenario, 41-year-old Assistant City Manager Jack McGrory is likely 
to be considered a leading candidate for the post. McGrory said Tuesday that he 
is interested in the job, which pays Lockwood more than $125,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood's successor will inherit a council concerned with how district 
elections have altered the balance of power between the mayor and council 
members, producing calls from several for a strengthening of the mayor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood, San Diego's 17th city manager, assumed his post Oct. 14, 1986, the 
day after the council accepted the resignation of Sylvester Murray, who came 
from outside the city and whose difficult tenure ended in just 13 months. A 
career administrator, Lockwood restored a measure of stability to city 
government after Murray's departure, a role he has again played during the past 
year of political infighting at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"He brought stability to the city behind the scenes," said Bernie Rhinerson, 
vice president of government relations for Home Capital Development Corp. 
"Behind the scenes, the city of San Diego has still run very efficiently, very 
smoothly day to day." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the higher-profile Murray, Lockwood has stayed in the 
background, scrupulously adhering to his role as a career civil servant. He has 
eschewed politics, publicly playing no favorites and striving to treat each 
council office evenhandedly, despite a long, close relationship with O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
"He is scrupulously conscious of the rules and regulations of the 
organization," said John Fowler, who served as assistant city manager under 
Lockwood until 1988. "He abides by everything. I doubt if he ever jaywalked." 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood took his first job in 1949 as a mail messenger and mimeograph operator 
for the county and city of San Diego before receiving a bachelor's degree in 
public administration from San Diego State University. He later served as a 
custodian, stock clerk and dump watcher for the city and county. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood held a variety of administrative posts before becoming city clerk in 
1966. He left that job in 1971 to join the city manager's office, becoming 
assistant city manager in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood, who had turned down the city manager's job once before, presided over 
an era of retrenchment in city services, partly caused by rapid population 
growth in the mid- and late 1980s that was not matched by increases in 
operating revenues. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Lockwood described the city's financial plight for fiscal 1991 as 
the worst in 56 years, significantly more difficult even than the budget 
cutting mandated by the 1978 passage of Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood continued the city's tradition of fiscal conservatism, despite major 
increases in the budget for capital programs. In its latest survey of fiscal 
1990 budgets, City and State magazine ranked San Diego 49th among the nation's 
50 largest cities in long-term debt per capita, and 48th in number of employees 
per 1,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1989, Business Monthly magazine named San Diego one of the 10 
best-managed cities in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the tight fiscal constraints under which he operated, Lockwood was 
credited by city and community leaders for a number of innovations, including 
his 1988 program to improve customer service in a number of city departments. 
</P>
<P>
Under the theme of, "If they had a choice, our customers would come to us," 
Lockwood installed innovations such as a one-stop permit counter in the 
Building Inspection department. 
</P>
<P>
He presided over planning for the city's largest ever public works project, the 
$2.6-billion overhaul of its sewage treatment system, and helped lead the 
council through years of laborious debate over growth management. 
</P>
<P>
He lost a bid, however, to build a new City Hall complex, despite escalating 
city payments for rented office space. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood said accomplishments during his tenure include the city's decision to 
restore Balboa and Mission Bay parks, his selection of mid-level and 
top-echelon personnel and the city's relative freedom from corruption. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of being ethical and principled about how we conduct business, I'll 
match us up with anyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after he took over, Lockwood issued letters of reprimand to then-Police 
Chief Bill Kolender and Assistant Chief Bob Burgreen after determining that 
Kolender had fixed tickets for friends and influential San Diegans, used a city 
employee to run personal errands and failed to report gifts. 
</P>

Lockwood will retire with a pension that pays him about two-thirds of his 
$125,944 annual salary. He said he has no immediate plans other than to help 
pilot a sailboat through the Panama Canal.

"I'm just at a situation where I don't have to do anything. I'm financially 
independent," he said. "If something comes up, maybe I'll do it. If not, maybe 
I'll indulge myself in the search for the world's perfect Chardonnay."

LOCAL GIVERS ON TARGET WITH UNITED WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a soft economy and disruptions caused by the Persian Gulf crisis, 
Ventura County is bucking a nationwide trend and meeting United Way's 1990-91 
fund-raising goal, agency officials reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Spearheaded by 3,000 volunteers who spread the word in companies and 
organizations across the county, United Way of Ventura County thus far has 
managed to avoid serious money-raising problems that have confronted its 
national parent and some of the 64 local agencies it helps support, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, we're on target" in a countywide campaign to raise more than $6 
million, said Colleen Hunter, executive director of the county United Way. The 
goal would be a 10% increase over the $5.6 million contributed last year. 
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, the drive had raised $3.7 million since it was officially 
launched Sept. 1. The campaign ends Dec. 31, but money received after that will 
be recorded as part of the 1990-91 campaign, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
The county group's success contrasts with the experience of its parent, United 
Way of America. "Things are certainly a little tighter this year," said Tony De 
Cristofaro, United Way of America's chief spokesman, in a telephone interview 
from Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
De Cristofaro said contributions to this year's $3 billion U.S. drive are up 
only 4.8% over a year ago. This, he said, falls significantly short of the 
projected increase of 6.8%. 
</P>
<P>
"We're raising more money than last year, but unless things improve, there's a 
good chance it won't be enough to keep up with inflation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I know you're not supposed to say the R word, but many communities in this 
country are going through a recession. That means some folks who used to 
support United Way now are depending on it for food, shelter and other 
services." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, De Cristofaro said, the deployment of hundreds of thousands of 
military personnel to the Middle East has made it virtually impossible to seek 
contributions from them. "Normally, they're among our major supporters," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, the business downturn is blamed for the failure of several United Way 
agencies to reach their independent fund-raising targets. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard Corps of the Salvation Army has reported a sharp decrease in the 
number of families volunteering to help the needy in its Adopt-A-Family 
Christmas program. 
</P>
<P>
Similar difficulties in obtaining public support have been experienced by two 
other Oxnard charity services, run by Food Share Inc. and Mary Star of the Sea 
Church. And Fillmore Voluntary Services, which feeds the hungry year-round, 
said this year's donations are down about 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter said two groups -- the county's thousands of federal employees and 
aerospace-defense workers -- have been major factors in the success of the 
countywide campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the aerospace and defense companies have had serious layoffs. But in 
many cases, the people still on the payroll have made up for this by increasing 
their per-capita contributions," she said. As a result, contributions from 
aerospace and defense workers have so far exceeded projections by $52,000, 
Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, she cited Contel Federal Systems in Westlake Village, whose 
employees and managers have pledged more than $43,000. "That's less than they 
gave last year, but employment at the plant is off significantly. Their 
per-capita contributions are up." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter said Ventura County employees of Teledyne Electronics in Westlake 
Village and Exxon have also increased individual giving after seeing some of 
their fellow workers laid off. 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Hunter said, the thousands of federal employees at Navy installations 
at Point Mugu, Port Hueneme and elsewhere in the county have given more than 
was expected even though hundreds of military personnel have shipped out in 
support of Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
The federal workers have given $855,000 to United Way -- $55,000 above their 
goal and nearly $100,000 more than last year, Hunter reported. 
</P>
<P>
Workers at the county's biggest private employer, GTE California, have not yet 
completed their 1990-91 campaign, but the corporation already has given United 
Way a $65,000 gift, Hunter said. "Their workers are usually No. 1 in the county 
and we expect them to repeat again this year." 
</P>
<P>
About 76% of all United Way of Ventura County contributions are made through 
payroll deductions, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Light, the county agency's campaign director, said she was gratified by 
the results thus far, but noted that "our increases were even higher -- 15% to 
22% annually -- in the early 1980s." In those days, she said, Ventura County 
led the nation in fund-raising among counties its size. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hunter said, county residents this year "have been very, very generous. 
They know some people are having a tough time. We've found that those who are 
still employed want to share with others."

DRUNK DRIVERS TO BE BILLED BY POLICE

<P>
Fillmore will try to recover the costs of drunk-driving arrests, the City 
Council decided Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Local police will bill convicted drivers for the time spent processing each 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
The fee will be charged when the case is filed, and defendants who are found 
innocent will be issued a refund, said Lt. Dick Purnell of the Ventura County 
sheriff's office in Fillmore. Purnell said 134 people were arrested for driving 
under the influence in the city last year. 
</P>
<P>
Officers spend an average of three hours on each arrest, he said. Their time 
will be billed at $29 per hour. The new $120 fee now charged to cities for 
booking suspects into the county jail will be included in Fillmore's costs, for 
a total of about $207 per drunk-driving offense. 
</P>
<P>
The city's charges will be levied in addition to any fines or other penalties 
related to the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Purnell said that the city is charged a booking fee most often for 
drunk-driving arrests. The ordinance will take effect in mid-January. He said 
the department also is researching cost recovery for other crimes. JANET

MURDER TRIAL FIGURE CONVICTED IN NEW CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A jury Tuesday found Meecee Parks, formerly known as Sagon Penn, guilty of 
filing false documents in court and of battery in an incident involving his 
ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
In trials in 1986 and 1987, Parks, 28, was acquitted of murder, manslaughter 
and assault in the death of one San Diego Police officer and the wounding of 
another officer and a civilian who was in a police car. 
</P>
<P>
He recently changed his name from Sagon Penn to Meecee Parks. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Superior Court jury deliberated about 5 1/2 hours before finding 
Parks guilty Tuesday of all charges. 
</P>
<P>
He was charged with two counts of filing a false document in Superior Court and 
altering a temporary restraining order against his former girlfriend after it 
had already been signed by a judge. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Herbert Exarhos set sentencing for Jan. 10 and allowed Parks to remain 
free on $15,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Steve Anear unsuccessfully asked the judge to remand Parks 
to custody, saying he posed a danger because of his continued harassment of the 
former girlfriend, Donna Parks. 
</P>
<P>
Meecee Parks faces a maximum sentence of four years and 10 months in state 
prison plus a $10,000 fine. The charges involving the filing of false documents 
and altering court records are felonies, but the battery charge is a 
misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
Parks acted as his own attorney Aug. 17 when he met with Judge Wesley Mason and 
won an order prohibiting Donna Parks from contacting him. 
</P>
<P>
However, the judge later said he saw that the temporary restraining order had 
been altered to include a ban on Donna Parks' contacting her new boyfriend, 
Maurice Bell. Bell was not named as a party in the case, and Mason testified 
that he would not have signed such a document. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's case took up only one day, and Meecee Parks did not testify 
in his defense. 
</P>
<P>
Parks' two trials in San Diego were highly publicized events because Parks, who 
is black, claimed he shot the white officers because one of them subjected him 
to racial slurs and a beating after a traffic stop in Encanto on Mar. 31, 1985.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWYER CONVICTED OF EMBEZZLING $200,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lawyer was convicted Tuesday of embezzling about $200,000 from 10 clients 
between 1984 and 1987 by settling their cases without telling them and 
pocketing their awards. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Steven Kotzker, 44, of Los Angeles was convicted by a Superior Court 
jury on 10 counts of grand theft and one count of forgery. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors, who deliberated eight days, were deadlocked on six other counts, 
which the judge dismissed at the prosecutor's request. 
</P>
<P>
Kotzker practiced law for 12 years, specializing in personal injury lawsuits 
and criminal defense. He was arrested in February, 1988, and disbarred after 
several clients filed complaints against him. 
</P>
<P>
He faces a maximum sentence of nine years in jail when he is sentenced Jan. 4 
by Superior Court Judge Valerie Baker. 
</P>
<P>
"He would settle a case without the consent of his client, or the victim, then 
deposit the (settlement) money in his trust account and never reimburse the 
client or let the client know he settled," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Don Tamura.

REPORT OF RAPE BRINGS JUSTICE 25 YEARS LATER; 
</P>
<P>
CRIMES: A SUNLAND WOMAN'S FATHER IS CONVICTED AFTER SHE PERSUADES PROSECUTORS 
IN WYOMING, WHICH HAS NO STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IN SUCH CASES, TO FILE CHARGES 
AGAINST HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an extremely unusual case that could not have been prosecuted in California, 
the father of a 38-year-old Sunland woman has been convicted in Wyoming of 
raping his daughter and niece more than 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Prompted by psychological counseling, Lorretta Woodbury contacted Wyoming 
authorities in January and asked them to prosecute her father, Lloyd Calvin 
Woodbury, for sexually molesting her and a cousin in the late 1950s and early 
'60s. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Woodbury's efforts, her father was charged in August with five 
felony sexual abuse counts in connection with assaults on Woodbury, his niece 
and a third girl, also a niece, whose alleged molestation came to light after 
Wyoming authorities began an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming authorities believe that the case is one of the oldest non-murder cases 
in that state and probably in the nation. Filing the case was possible because 
Wyoming, unlike most other states, has no statute of limitations on criminal 
cases, officials said. In California, the statute of limitations ranges from 
two to six years for all crimes except murder, which has no time limit, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Now 73 and living in Ingram, Tex., Lloyd Woodbury pleaded guilty Nov. 28 in 
Carbon County to having raped his daughter, then 10, in the summer of 1962 and 
his niece, then 13, in the summer of 1958. 
</P>
<P>
The assaults occurred in Rawlins, a city of 8,000 in south-central Wyoming, 
where the family lived at the time, said Lorretta Woodbury, a free-lance 
commercial artist who moved to the San Fernando Valley two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a plea bargain, prosecutors dropped additional accusations that 
Woodbury took "indecent liberties" with another 8-year-old niece in 1958 and 
with his daughter in 1959 and that he raped his daughter in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming 2nd Judicial District Judge Larry Lehman sentenced Woodbury, a retired 
taxidermist and bronze sculptor, to five years probation and ordered him to 
undergo counseling and to avoid contact with the victims. He must avoid being 
around children unless another adult is present, said Carbon County Prosecuting 
Atty. Kurt Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
Lorretta Woodbury said psychological counseling she received at the Valley 
Trauma Center at Cal State Northridge made her decide to try to have her father 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed for five minutes that they would do anything with it," she 
said in a telephone interview. "Basically what I was doing was venting. Instead 
of keeping all this stuff to myself and letting myself be a victim, I was 
starting to say I am not going to keep quiet anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly at first told Lorretta Woodbury that it would be practically impossible 
to find enough evidence to prosecute so old a case. Undeterred, she provided 
more details, persuading Kelly to turn the case over to the Carbon County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Although decades had passed, investigators emerged with what Kelly considered 
strong evidence: All three women, independently, told similar stories, 
corroborating each other. Further corroboration came from relatives and other 
witnesses who confirmed that the assaults had been reported to them decades 
ago, the prosecutor added. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Woodbury, interviewed by phone in Texas, said he waived extradition and 
pleaded guilty to the charges "to keep from going to court." He denied raping 
his daughter or nieces. 
</P>
<P>
"I had relations with one of the friends but there was no rape to it. Just 
sexual relations," Lloyd Woodbury said. "She'd been married. It was just one of 
those things, you know." 
</P>
<P>
He accused his daughter of making the allegations in retaliation for his 
accusations against her of committing grand theft seven years ago while living 
in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter denied her father's allegations and said she pleaded no contest to 
embezzlement charges only to avoid going to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Casper, Wyo., to parents who soon divorced, Lorretta Woodbury lived 
with her mother and on a welfare ranch before being sent to live with her 
father and stepmother at age 7. 
</P>
<P>
According to Woodbury, the abuse started almost immediately. She said her 
father molested her in his taxidermy shop and ordered her not to talk about 
what he said was "something special between fathers and daughters." 
</P>
<P>
The abuse escalated to mutual oral sex and, on her 10th birthday, to 
intercourse, said Woodbury, who remembers her father assaulting her in his 
truck outside town and then taking her home to eat birthday cake. 
</P>
<P>
Her father threatened to send her to reform school if she told anyone and told 
her that he had friends at the post office who would intercept any letters she 
tried to write seeking help, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"At that age, you believe that stuff," said Woodbury, who only later learned 
that her father was also molesting a cousin. "I didn't feel good about it but I 
didn't feel there was much I could do about it. I felt it was all my fault and 
I deserved it. 
</P>
<P>
"He bought me just about anything I wanted. I had motorcycles and horses. I was 
in 4-H, junior choir, went to church and taught vacation Bible School." But she 
recalls having severe problems in school. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when they had the first class on sex education, I felt like 
crawling under the table at school because my dad and I had been doing that," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The molestation continued, about three times a week in her father's shop, the 
barn, the truck -- even in the house at night, with her stepmother asleep in 
another room, Woodbury recalled. Altogether, the abuse continued for seven 
years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The molestation ended after Lorretta Woodbury's stepsister came to visit. 
Woodbury wrote a note to her mother detailing the sexual abuse and sewed it 
into her sister's coat, she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Social workers removed the girl, then 14, from home a few weeks later but her 
father was never prosecuted. Authorities said law enforcement officials were 
reluctant to prosecute such cases in past years. 
</P>
<P>
Lorretta Woodbury spent nearly two years in a state mental hospital and held a 
series of jobs before moving to Texas at 31 to be near her father and her 
ailing stepmother, whom she loved. There, she said, she began confronting her 
father about the past abuse. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving probation on the embezzlement conviction, she came West again, 
settling two years ago in the Valley. She began attending Metropolitan 
Community Church. Urged by church officials to seek help in dealing with the 
incest in her background, she sought counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel relieved, peaceful," she said about reporting the abuse, adding that 
she hopes that her example will "help other incest victims. Our lives are worth 
something."

FIREFIGHTERS TO BE TRAINED AS PARAMEDICS IN TEST PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego will use firefighters trained as paramedics to respond to emergency 
calls under a pilot program adopted by the City Council on Tuesday that begins 
next October. 
</P>
<P>
The council's decision ended a year of debate over what to do about the city's 
contract with Hartson Medical Services -- the primary provider of paramedic 
service -- and the company's pleas for additional subsidies. Hartson's existing 
contract with the city expires in June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council approved a two-year extension of the contract, with the 
test program beginning in October, 1991, and ending in June, 1993. The council 
plan calls for the city to train 35 firefighters as paramedics and establish a 
system that requires a firefighter-paramedic and Hartson paramedics to respond 
to the same emergency call. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's firefighters are not now qualified to perform paramedic duties. All 
of the city's paramedic calls are now answered by Hartson. 
</P>
<P>
Under the original plan presented to the council, eight fire stations situated 
north of Miramar Road and three stations in San Ysidro would have firefighters 
trained as paramedics. On Tuesday, the council added two stations to the plan 
-- one in East San Diego, the other in Southeast San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
According to a study, fire units carrying at least one firefighter-paramedic 
could respond within five to six minutes to emergency calls received from 
within the individual station's operational area. Studies have shown that 
firefighters are often the first to arrive at the scene of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Hartson paramedics now are required to respond to emergency calls within 11 
minutes. In areas where a firefighter-paramedic will respond to emergency 
calls, Hartson will be given an additional minute to arrive without being 
penalized. Once at the scene, the two paramedics that ride in every Hartson 
ambulance would assume responsibility for the patient and transfer him to a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Council members directed the city manager to review the new program after a 
year and decide if it should be implemented throughout the city. The council 
also asked staff to find $85,000 in next year's budget for the pilot program in 
East and Southeast San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The shared program is supposed to reduce the city's subsidy to Hartson, whose 
employees were unionized this year. Deputy City Manager Maureen Stapleton said 
the city will save $588,339 in the first year of the program and $606,284 in 
the second year. 
</P>
<P>
The city's subsidies to the ambulance company in each of those years will be 
$2.03 million and $2.23 million.

Recently some person reported one of my cars for emitting smoke on the 101 
Freeway in Calabasas. As an environment-conscious individual (that's why I live 
in Westlake), I had the vehicle checked out every which way. 
</P>
<P>
We could not make it emit smoke. It never has and it has always passed its smog 
check. Obviously, the reporter was mistaken, vindictive or just a regular jerk. 
</P>
<P>
I called air quality officials for the name of the person who falsely accused 
me. (Someone has to pay for lost time and mechanic's time). Air quality 
officials will not pay my expenses and they will not reveal their freeway 
"Gestapo" colleague. I was under the mistaken belief that in America we have 
the right to face our accuser. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Supervisor Susan K. Lacey and Richard H. Baldwin, manager of the 
county Air Pollution Control District, should think cautiously about how they 
structure a plan for a hot line to report smoking vehicles. This is Ventura 
County, Calif., U.S.A., 1990, not Nazi Germany and the Gestapo of the 1930s. If 
they want people to be conscientious about this program, then give the falsely 
accused the right of recourse and restitution.

COUNTY OKS STUDY BY AIR POLLUTERS

At least 19 Ventura County businesses that pollute the air will be required to 
study whether their emissions could cause cancer in nearby residents under a 
program unanimously approved Tuesday by the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Companies targeted in the next two weeks by the county Air Pollution Control 
District will have to inform the public whether the chance of contracting 
cancer is greater that one in a million if a person lives nearby for 70 years, 
said Karl E. Krause, manager of the air pollution district's engineering 
section. 
</P>
<P>
The program is based on the state Air Toxics Hot Spots Information and 
Assessment Act of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The law requires air pollution control districts to determine the sources of 
more than 400 contaminants released into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that emit more than 25 tons a year of pollutants submitted their 
emission lists earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The results of that inventory produced a list of 40 pollution sources in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
They include 20 oil field pumping stations, five manufacturing companies and 
two defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are deciding which of the 40 companies must do health risk 
assessments, Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he estimated that it would take officials another two weeks to come up 
with the final list. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 24 companies reviewed so far, 19 must do the assessments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Krause said he expected to decide on the remaining 16 companies in the next two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The selected companies will have six months to perform health assessments, 
including examining the height of smoke stacks or vents emitting the 
pollutants, the proximity of neighborhoods and weather and wind patterns in the 
area. The California Department of Health Services then has six months to 
review the findings, Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
If the studies show a significant health risk, state law requires the results 
to be provided to all exposed people. CAROL WATSON

STATE FINES HOSPITAL OVER GAS LEAK; 
</P>
<P>
JOB SAFETY: TARZANA REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER IS PENALIZED NEARLY $5,000 AFTER A 
TECHNICIAN IS EXPOSED TO ETHYLENE OXIDE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
State job-safety inspectors have fined a Tarzana hospital nearly $5,000 after a 
technician was exposed to a suspected cancer-causing gas leaking from a machine 
used to sterilize surgical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
But Cal-OSHA officials dropped more than $12,000 in additional fines against 
Tarzana Regional Medical Center after deciding that they could not prove that 
the hospital didn't have proper mechanical controls to prevent future leaks, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital was cited Oct. 2 for 18 violations of state worker-protection 
laws, including five repeat offenses. Cal-OSHA officials Tuesday released 
details of the citations, which carried $17,100 in potential fines. 
</P>
<P>
Cal-OSHA said ethylene oxide gas, which is associated with higher rates of 
cancer in people, accidentally leaked from the instrument sterilizer three 
times in May and July. Three workers at the 600-employee hospital were possibly 
exposed to the gas, but only one had any symptoms, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
During a May 28 leak, hospital technician Margarita Luna entered the sterilizer 
room without wearing an emergency respirator, Cal-OSHA said. Luna experienced 
tingling in her fingers and toes but the symptoms later disappeared, according 
to hospital officials. 
</P>
<P>
Following a five-day inspection last summer, the hospital was cited for, among 
other things, not having sufficient engineering controls on the sterilizer to 
prevent other leaks, an offense punishable by a $10,000 fine. This was a repeat 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital was also cited for not supplying employees with respirators, not 
training them about hazardous substances on the job and failing to notify state 
officials within 24 hours of an employee's exposure to ethylene oxide. 
</P>
<P>
But hospital officials later told Cal-OSHA that they had made a number of 
repairs to the sterilizing machine before and after the gas seepages, including 
fixing an electrical short and a faulty door gasket. 
</P>
<P>
After two hospital executives met Oct. 31 with Cal-OSHA's Van Nuys district 
manager, Ed Grimes, the agency dropped the $10,000 citation and another 
citation charging that the hospital had not properly monitored employees' 
exposure to possible gas releases. 
</P>
<P>
Grimes refused to discuss the action. But Cal-OSHA media spokesman Rick Rice 
said the $10,000 citation was canceled because the agency felt that it couldn't 
legally defend its allegation that the hospital didn't have sufficient 
engineering controls on the sterilizer. Employers cited by Cal-OSHA have the 
right to appeal in court. 
</P>
<P>
"They actually did have engineering controls, but the controls failed," he 
said. "I guess we just have to say that it was felt that the citation was not 
legally supportable upon appeal." 
</P>
<P>
John Jeffries, senior vice president of the hospital, said the hospital will 
probably pay the remaining fines without filing an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
He said the sterilizer, which was shut down after the leaks, has been working 
properly for the past four to six weeks. He said the ethylene oxide gas used to 
sterilize surgical instruments evaporates and poses no danger to patients.

AQMD ACTS TO ENSURE DUMP'S COMPLIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Regional air-quality officials adopted a measure Tuesday that would enable them 
to go to court if necessary to shut down Lopez Canyon Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District's hearing board voted 3 to 2 in 
favor of an order requiring noxious gas emissions and odors to be kept in check 
at the controversial landfill, whose operations and alleged health hazards have 
been the subject of public hearings over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
The measure essentially copies an agreement already approved by the Los Angeles 
City Council and does little more than provide the agency with one extra 
document that it could take to a judge to prove that the landfill is violating 
environmental rules, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Technically, it wasn't necessary but it provides us with a stronger position, 
a better enforcement tool in ensuring the landfill stays in compliance," said 
AQMD attorney Elliott R. Sernel. "A lot of it is due to the fact that the city 
in the past hasn't always acted in the best of faith and we felt it was 
necessary to have an additional document as a kind of additional hammer." 
</P>
<P>
Christopher M. Westhoff, an assistant city attorney representing the sanitation 
bureau, said he was confident such action wouldn't be needed. He also 
maintained that the city-owned dump in the northeastern San Fernando Valley is 
operating in compliance with district regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Dissenting were board members William F. Banks and Mark Abramowitz, who said he 
voted against the order because it was not strict enough. Banks could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Abramowitz, an environmental consultant, tried to strengthen the measure with 
several proposals, including a ban on landfill expansion until any existing 
violations have been corrected and the dump has been in compliance for at least 
30 days. 
</P>
<P>
But his proposal was rejected in a 3-2 vote, with members Harold Brown, Esther 
Lewin and James Joyce in the majority. 
</P>
<P>
Abramowitz said later that he believed the board had been swayed by threats 
that the city would file suit if board members tried to impose any conditions 
stricter than those agreed to by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
One additional requirement adopted by the hearing board Tuesday was an order 
that the city submit a status report by April 1 on landfill operations and 
compliance. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Hines, a member of the Lake View Terrace Improvement Assn., said "we 
were very disappointed the board didn't support" Abramowitz's motion. 
</P>
<P>
"After 36 hearings, we hoped for just a little bit more," Hines said. But she 
added that in general, "I feel the board did quite a bit of good."

ASBESTOS VIOLATOR GETS 3-YEAR PROBATION 
</P>

A San Diego contractor convicted of removing asbestos from a Navy ship without 
following federal safety laws, possibly exposing dozens of people to the 
carcinogen, was sentenced Monday to three years of supervised probation, 
including six months at a rehabilitation center that would allow him to leave 
only for work, U.S. Atty. William Braniff said. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Chavez, whose company was hired to remove asbestos-covered piping from 
the aircraft carrier Ranger, also was ordered to perform 100 hours of community 
service in the sentence handed down by U.S. Magistrate Irma E. Gonzalez, a 
statement issued by Braniff said. Chavez's company, California Marine 
Commercial Insulation, was fined $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez and his company were convicted on two misdemeanor counts each for 
failing to comply with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency laws regulating the 
removal of asbestos, identified as a hazardous substance in 1971. Chavez plead 
guilty to one of the charges in August -- failure to notify the EPA that he was 
going to remove asbestos. But Gonzalez found that he also had violated EPA work 
practice standards, including failure to label the removed asbestos, to wet it 
down before working with it and to seal it in leak-proof containers, the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Former workers with the company told The Times in August that they had ripped 
out crumbling asbestos in bathrooms, berthing rooms and stairways, and the brig 
of the ship last winter, while sailors were aboard. They said they carried the 
asbestos through the ship and piled it on the hangar deck, often without 
wearing protective clothing or masks. 
</P>
<P>
A naval investigative team, called together after one of the workers complained 
of unsafe practices by his company, identified 30 sailors who might have been 
exposed to airborne asbestos fibers, Capt. Charlie Robinson, safety officer 
with the Pacific Fleet's Naval Air Force, told The Times in September. 
</P>
<P>
The county Air Pollution Control District also was called in to determine 
whether violations of EPA laws took place. An APCD investigator testified that 
the workers had placed the asbestos in a refuse bin without wetting it down, 
which helps keep it from crumbling into a powder and releasing fibers into the 
air, said district spokesman Bob Goggin. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no safe level of exposure to asbestos fiber established," Goggin 
said, adding that asbestos has been linked to many cancers and a fatal lung 
ailment called asbestosis. The four-month investigation prompted the APCD to 
inspect other ships in San Diego for unsafe asbestos removal practices, Goggin 
said. Thirty-four violations involving 13 vessels and eight private contractors 
were discovered, all for failing to notify the EPA that they were going to 
remove asbestos. Two Navy command units were cited for failing to supervise 
working procedures aboard the ships. 
</P>
<P>
The case is the seventh in the nation successfully prosecuted against people 
and companies who violated asbestos removal laws, the statement said.

CARLSBAD QUESTIONED ON MINORITY HIRING; 
</P>
<P>
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION: OFFICIALS WANT TO KNOW ABOUT CITY'S PLAN; MINORITY HIRING 
HASN'T MATCHED GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Federal authorities are questioning Carlsbad's efforts at affirmative action 
because the number of ethnic minorities employed at City Hall is not keeping 
pace with the city's growth, officials acknowledged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gallegos, a commissioner on the U.S. Equal Opportunity Employment 
Commission in Washington, sent a letter to Mayor Bud Lewis requesting more 
information on Carlsbad's affirmative action plan, said Ann Jensen, human 
resources director for the city. 
</P>
<P>
During 1988 and 1989, 12% of Carlsbad's then-479 city employees were minority 
members, she said. The city is only now compiling its hiring figures for this 
year, and she could not predict if the percentage of minorities has risen, 
Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegos' Oct. 5 letter states that he reviewed annual reports filed by the 
city with the federal agency between from 1981 to 1987. "The review reveals a 
steady growth in total employment in city government," the letter said, "but no 
growth in minority employment." 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad officials, however, stressed Tuesday that Gallegos had only expressed 
concern about the city's minority hiring picture and has not launched any 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not under investigation," Jensen said. "Mr. Gallegos was in Carlsbad 
earlier this year and met with some Hispanic groups in the city. He then sent a 
letter expressing some of his concerns. He has taken a very supportive role in 
recognizing that changing the demographics in the work force takes a certain 
amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Baldonado, an attorney with Gallegos' office, said he could not comment on 
any matter that could be investigated by his agency. 
</P>
<P>
The EEOC occasionally investigates city and county agencies on minority hiring 
discrepancies if complaints are received. Penalties could involve a 
class-action lawsuit filed by an individual or the U.S. Justice Department, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jensen, who has held her position for little more than a year, said she cannot 
explain the slow growth of minority hiring in Carlsbad, adding that she has 
begun several minority-hiring efforts since she started with the city last 
September. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't address why the numbers were down before I came here," she said. "But, 
in the last year, I have begun several proactive and outreach programs to 
attract qualified minority applicants to the city." 
</P>
<P>
In an Oct. 17 letter to Gallegos, Jensen said the commissioner's concerns are 
issues "that the city is fully aware of and is clearly concerned about." 
</P>
<P>
She also said the city is updating its decade-old affirmative action plan and 
has spent several months reviewing its minority recruitment and selection 
process. 
</P>
<P>
To reach the greatest minority population, the city now advertises all of its 
jobs with the Veteran's Administration, the Hispanic Hotline and other Latino 
publications, the Women's Resource Center and Senior Citizens Job Development 
Center, as well as USA Press, a black newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the city has been brought to the attention of the EEOC in recent years 
for its dealings with minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Porter, the EEOC district director for the Los Angeles area, which 
includes San Diego, said that, since 1986, the agency has investigated eight 
complaints filed against Carlsbad for minority hiring issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the ones we have closed," she said. "I can't comment on any open 
investigations." 
</P>
<P>
She refused to divulge the results of those investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad officials claimed the city recently has been distracted by a lawsuit 
filed by a former personnel director, who claimed that age discrimination by 
the city forced him out of his job in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Pieti filed suit in U.S. District Court after his dismissal, claiming 
that the city's management was trying to force him out of a job because of his 
age. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Pieti, 63, reached an agreement with city officials that would pay 
him more than $240,000 in back pay and retirement benefits -- an agreement that 
still must be approved by the Carlsbad City Council.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MALE PROSTITUTE, 29, ACQUITTED IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An admitted male prostitute accused of killing a man who picked him up in 
Hollywood last year was acquitted on a murder charge Tuesday by jurors who said 
they thought he acted in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Nichols, 29, was on trial for the December, 1989, death of Edward 
Parsley, 52, who was fatally stabbed in his Sylmar residence. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols said he stabbed Parsley after the man threatened to beat him and turn 
his dogs on him because he refused to allow Parsley to sodomize him. 
</P>
<P>
Parsley was stabbed several times in the back and shoulder with a kitchen knife 
early Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols wept and laid his head against Deputy Public Defender David Coleman's 
shoulder as the court clerk read the jury's verdict. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said outside the courtroom they believed Coleman's argument that Nichols 
was justified in killing Parsley because he feared for his life. They also said 
they were swayed by Nichols' testimony in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"He did have a reason to fear that he was in danger," juror Wanda Demetrion of 
Sylmar said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN GETS 180 DAYS ON WEAPONS CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Lancaster man, whose arsenal of guns, grenades and an antitank rocket 
launcher was seized in a September raid, was sentenced Monday to 180 days in 
County Jail for possession of a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Sundahl, 44, pleaded no-contest to the charge in a sentencing agreement 
with Lancaster Superior Court Judge Charles E. Horan, who dropped remaining 
weapons charges. 
</P>
<P>
Sundahl also received five years' probation as part of the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Sundahl and Edward Coleman, 40, also of Lancaster, were arrested Sept. 20 when 
sheriff's deputies raided a boarded-up farmhouse in Lancaster and found an 
antitank rocket launcher but no rockets. They also found several rifles, hand 
grenades and a large amount of gunpowder. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven Ogden said Sundahl had a license to operate as a gun 
dealer and possessed most of the weapons legally. 
</P>
<P>
The trial for Coleman, who was charged with drug possession after a small 
amount of methamphetamine was found, will begin Jan. 7.

<P>
The Burbank City Council on Tuesday approved the establishment of several 
temporary barricades in Toluca Lake neighborhoods to cut down on motorists who 
use the streets as a shortcutfrom the nearby Media District. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said residents in the area have complained for years about the amount 
of traffic coming in from the district, which is the headquarters for several 
movie and television studios. 
</P>
<P>
Seven streets will be closed in about two weeks with temporary wooden 
barricades as part of a 90-day trial program, officials said. The affected 
streets are National Avenue, McFarlane Avenue, Warner Boulevard, Toluca Lake 
Avenue, Franklin Avenue and Hood Avenue between Rose Street and Olive/Pass 
avenues, and Rose Street between Lakeside Drive and Hood Avenue.

A proposal to build a fence along the median of Interstate 5 to prevent more 
deaths of illegal immigrants near the Camp Pendleton border checkpoint is "a 
waste of money," community leaders told state transportation officials Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A recent study by California State University, Fullerton, researchers 
commissioned by the state concluded that construction of a fence along 8 miles 
of the freeway north of Oceanside is the best way to prevent accidents that 
have claimed more than 100 lives in five years on highways from the border to 
San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say it's a waste of money," said Evelyn Colon Becktell, chairwoman of 
the Orange County Coalition for Immigrant Rights, who attended the California 
Department of Transportation meeting at the Fullerton Public Library. "When 
they put up more lights (along the highway), the immigrants went farther up the 
highway, where there were no lights. The same thing is going to happen with the 
wall. They're going to go farther up along I-5, and, one way or another, 
they're going to get killed." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials are hosting a series of meetings to expand public awareness 
about the immigrant deaths. They told the small gathering that they are working 
with officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Border Patrol and 
the California Highway Patrol to find a solution for a problem that stems from 
the tens of thousands of immigrants streaming in from Latin America every year. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the deaths occur near the Border Patrol checkpoint near San Onofre. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants making their way north by vehicle are often told by their "coyotes," 
or smugglers, to get out of the car and walk several miles north past the 
checkpoint to avoid detection by Border Patrol agents. The hike, often taken in 
the dark of night, involves crossing the north- and southbound lanes of 
fast-moving traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"As the smuggling process becomes more sophisticated, we are seeing more 
problems at San Onofre," said Steve Saville of Caltrans' public affairs office. 
</P>
<P>
He and Jim Larson, another Caltrans spokesman, told those at the meeting that 
the wall is only a part of their campaign to prevent more deaths. They also are 
trying to spread the word among immigrants to be careful along the highways. 
</P>
<P>
One Caltrans flyer that has been handed out at hiring halls, community centers 
and churches says, "For the love of God do not cross the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to say what's working, but the word is starting to get out," 
Larson said, noting that there has not been a death for several months near San 
Onofre. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Cal State Fullerton, nearing the end of a yearlong study, polled 
100 policy-makers, academics, immigrant advocates and others who have followed 
the issue. They found that 71% of all respondents stated that a barrier would 
be a "very effective" or "extremely effective" device to prevent the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
But those at the Orange County meeting told Caltrans officials that getting the 
word out about the dangers, rather than erecting a barrier, is a better 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
"These people (coyotes) have no soul," said Santa Ana Police Officer Jose 
Vargas, who is in charge of Hispanic Affairs at the department. "They're just 
going to tell their people to bail out anyway. It might keep the women or 
children from doing it, but many people will still hike 8 miles rather than 
three to get around it." 
</P>
<P>
Larson said officials are still in the midst of hearing from more people before 
they make a final decision on whether to build the wall. 
</P>
<P>
And, even if they do decide to build it, he said, "and we see that it's more of 
a problem, causing more deaths, we'll take it out."

MOLINA STARTS RACE WITH MONEY EDGE -- SAYS SHE WON'T USE IT; 
</P>
<P>
ELECTION: THE COUNCILWOMAN, ONE OF FOUR MAJOR RIVALS IN THE CAMPAIGN FOR 
SUPERVISOR, CAN USE FUNDS LEFT FROM COUNCIL RACES. OPPONENTS DOUBT HER PLEDGE 
NOT TO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Gloria Molina begins the race for the 1st 
District seat on the county Board of Supervisors with access to the largest 
campaign fund of any candidate, thanks to a court ruling that permits the 
transfer of political funds from one campaign to another. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen, however, whether the councilwoman will take advantage of 
her initial funding advantage. Molina campaign officials said they will not tap 
her City Council coffer in the run for supervisor, but opponents have doubted 
that claim. 
</P>
<P>
Nine candidates who filed by Nov. 30 for the supervisor's seat -- in a district 
that stretches from El Sereno and Lincoln Heights east to Irwindale and La 
Puente and southeast to Santa Fe Springs -- will file their first campaign 
finance reports Thursday for the Jan. 22 special election. 
</P>
<P>
But the four big-name candidates in the race -- Molina, state Sen. Charles M. 
Calderon (D-Whittier), former supervisorial aide Sarah Flores and state Sen. 
Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) -- already have collected funds for previous 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
State and local campaign officials have told the candidates that a federal 
court ruling last year permits them to use the money raised for one office in a 
campaign for another. Fund transfers between campaigns had been prohibited 
until the court overruled parts of the 1988 campaign reform initiative, 
Proposition 73. 
</P>
<P>
Although campaign reports for the supervisorial candidates are not up to date, 
previously filed reports give an idea of how much money the opponents hold as 
fund raising begins in earnest. Campaign observers estimate it will cost at 
least $500,000 to run a winning campaign for the supervisor's seat. That 
includes the cost of a Feb. 19 runoff between the two leading candidates if, as 
many observers anticipate, no one wins more than 50% of the vote in the Jan. 22 
election. 
</P>
<P>
The previously filed campaign reports show that: 
</P>
<P>
* Molina's four City Council campaign committees had a total of $100,818 cash 
on hand as of June 30. Molina has had little cause to spend money since then, 
since her next city election would not be until 1993. 
</P>
<P>
* Torres, reelected handily to the Senate last month, had $64,678 cash on hand 
when he filed his last statement Oct. 20. That amount had been reduced to 
$30,000 by the end of his reelection drive last month, campaign spokeswoman Dee 
Dee Myers said. She said $20,000 of that has been transferred to the 
supervisorial campaign as "seed money." 
</P>
<P>
* Flores had $15,813 in cash as of June 30. About the same amount remains in 
her account going into a $500-a-plate dinner today 2that is being sponsored by 
several elected officials, including supervisors Deane Dana and Mike 
Antonovich, Flores campaign consultant Eric Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores raised her money for a June primary in the 1st District and an 
anticipated November runoff, but those races were nullified when U.S. District 
Judge David V. Kenyon ruled that the county's previous district boundaries 
illegally diluted the voting strength of Latinos. The January special election 
will be held in a new 1st District drawn under Kenyon's order. By a slim 
margin, the majority of the district's registered voters are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
* Calderon had $13,467 in campaign funds as of Oct. 20, after an April special 
election that elevated him from the Assembly to the state Senate. The candidate 
said he has transferred $5,500 of his Senate money to his supervisorial 
campaign fund. 
</P>
<P>
Molina aides said they are pleased they can use their large treasury, but plan 
to start their fund raising from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously it's a blessing, because it gives us a pool of money to start out," 
Molina press secretary Robert Alaniz said. "Any time you have to raise half a 
million dollars within a short period of time . . . the fact we can transfer 
money over creates a great boost for us." 
</P>
<P>
But Alaniz said Molina wants to use the City Council campaign funds only as a 
last resort, preferring to keep the money in her council campaign treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Torres' campaign officials, however, doubted that Molina would forsake her 
store of money. Myers, the Torres spokeswoman, claimed that Molina is merely 
downplaying the importance of the funds because the money explodes an image 
that she is trying to cultivate. 
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to bill Gloria as a grass-roots politician, who is out there 
pounding the pavement," Myers said. "And $100,000 is a big war chest. You don't 
associate that with grass-roots candidates." 
</P>
<P>
A representative of another campaign, who requested anonymity, suggested that 
Molina might try to benefit from her council funds indirectly. Since 25% of the 
voters in the 1st Supervisorial District also live in Molina's council 
district, the theory goes, she could boost her run for supervisor simply by 
sending council-related mailers to her current constituents in the city of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Molina campaign officials insisted, however, that they do not intend to spend 
the $100,000, either for mailers within the City Council district or for any 
aspect of the 1st Supervisorial District campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping the money in her council accounts would benefit Molina, the source 
suggested, because the amounts already collected would not be subject to 
campaign limits that will be enforced during the county campaign. 
</P>
<P>
By not transferring the money to her county campaign account, for example, 
Molina would be able to return to the same donors who have given to her in the 
past and ask them to contribute up to the maximum of $1,000 for the 
supervisor's race. If she transferred her council money to the supervisor's 
race, however, she would have to declare the names of the donors, and their 
previous contributions would be deducted from the maximum they could give 
Molina now. 
</P>
<P>
Contribution limits that affect the supervisor's race were ordered last week by 
the state Fair Political Practices Commission. The commission voted unanimously 
Tuesday in Sacramento that, for all special elections statewide, individuals 
and corporations can give a maximum of $1,000, and political action committees 
$2,500. 
</P>
<P>
The limits are the same as those approved by the voters in Proposition 73.

MORNING BRIEFING: PUBLICITY IDEA FINDS GOING ALL DOWNHILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fredy Brupbacher, a former Swiss ski racer now working in public relations, was 
planning to have female skiers wear a photo of a rolled-up condom and the 
slogan "Stop AIDS" on their numbered bibs in a World Cup super-giant slalom 
race at Meiringen, Switzerland, Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
That is, until the International Ski Federation (FIS) heard about it. 
</P>
<P>
FIS cited religious sensitivity and television rules and described the idea as 
"tasteless." 
</P>
<P>
The federation's general secretary, Gian-Franco Kasper, told Blick, a Swiss 
newspaper: "We cannot ask a strongly religious racer to show a contraceptive on 
her body." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Last Sunday, wide receiver Andre Reed of the Buffalo Bills broke a 
club record for touchdown passes formerly held by Elbert Dubenion. What was 
Dubenion's nickname? 
</P>
<P>
Her little guy: The December issue of Tennis magazine reports that 14-year-old 
Jennifer Capriati has no idols. 
</P>
<P>
Said Capriati: "I'm my own." 
</P>
<P>
She was asked about her seven Bart Simpson T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
Said Capriati: "Bart's cool because he's like a lot of kids. He says all those 
things like, 'Man,' and, 'Hey, dude,' and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Add Capriati: She commented on meeting actor Tom Cruise earlier this year: "I 
almost had a cow." 
</P>
<P>
. . . man. 
</P>
<P>
Not that green: In Pittsburgh's 24-3 victory over New England Sunday, Steeler 
guard Carlton Haselrig sprained his ankle and tackle Tunch Ilkin reinjured the 
dislocated elbow that kept him out for 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
On the same play. Thanks to the same teammate. 
</P>
<P>
Said Coach Chuck Noll: "We brought (6-foot-5, 274-pound rookie tight end) Eric 
Green in motion. And he was coming in to wham the nose guard and he hit the 
nose guard so hard he flew right into both Haselrig and Tunch. . . . So we want 
to keep the devastating blocking going, but we'll have to try to get the guys 
behind it out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Real football: Followers of Spanish soccer are divided as to whether Hristo 
Stoichkov, the Bulgarian who leads FC Barcelona in scoring, ought to be serving 
the 10-week suspension he received Tuesday -- or a suspension of six months. 
</P>
<P>
During a Dec. 5 game against Real Madrid, Stoichkov protested a call by referee 
Idlefonso Urizar Azpitarte, then stomped on Azpitarte's foot. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-week suspension is the maximum for a "violent action." The incident 
could have been ruled "aggression," which carries a six-month penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Add cleating: One Real Madrid official said: "We'll have to find out which part 
of the referee's body you have to hit in order for it to be an aggression." 
</P>
<P>
Odds against: Rick Brown of the Des Moines Register recently reported that Troy 
Skinner, starting point guard for Iowa, and Brian Pearson, the starting point 
guard for Iowa State, were two of seven boys in a graduating class of 17 at 
Palmer (Iowa) High. 
</P>
<P>
Now juniors, they were coached as prep players by Alden Skinner, Troy's father. 
Their team won 79 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
So who does?: Relief pitcher Dave Righetti, who signed with the San Francisco 
Giants last week, told the Associated Press about playing in a pro-am golf 
tournament a few weeks ago at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Righetti said he was kidded about the uncertainty of where he would be playing 
in 1991. "(Catcher) Rick Dempsey and (minor league manager) Jerry Royster from 
the Dodgers called me 'teammate,' things like that," Righetti said. "I didn't 
know how I felt about that. Playing for the Dodgers would be exciting . . . but 
I don't fit in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: "Golden Wheels." 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Cleveland center Mike Baab, on where to place the blame for the 
Browns' 2-11 record: "The coach says, 'Don't jump offsides.' Well, if you do, 
whose fault is that? Is that your fault or the coach's fault?" TED BROCK

The Anteaters shot often enough Tuesday against Maryland, they just didn't make 
enough of them, losing to the Terrapins, 93-79. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like a 14-point game on paper," Mulligan said after the Anteaters' 
loss in front of 7,263 in Cole Field House. "It wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine might have turned the tables on a Maryland team that had lost three 
games in a row. Instead, the Anteaters fell below .500 after making only 30 of 
82 shots (37%) and 14 of 46 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine attempted 31 more than Maryland. But Maryland made 59% of its shots, and 
that made all the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Irvine trailed only 81-77 with 2:23 to play. But Maryland's Kevin 
McLinton stopped the comeback when he drove hard to the basket with less than 
10 seconds left on the 45-second shot clock, and made a layup despite being 
fouled by Jeff Herdman. His free throw was good for a three-point play and a 
seven-point lead with 1:44 remaining. Maryland then made nine of 10 free throws 
the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine entered the game wary mostly of two players -- Walt Williams, the 
Terrapins' 6-foot-8 junior point guard, and Matt Roe, a senior transfer from 
Syracuse who is a three-point threat. Williams did some of the damage, scoring 
21 points, including two of five three-pointers. Roe scored 11 points and made 
just one three-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
But the most critical damage was done by center Cedric Lewis, whose usual 
specialty is defense. Against the Anteaters, he scored a career-high 21 points 
and matched his best performance with 14 rebounds. His eight blocked shots were 
also a career high. 
</P>
<P>
"We were concerned with Roe, but Lewis really hurt us," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis also did his part in defending Irvine center Ricky Butler, who had a poor 
first half for the second game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, averaging 19 points a game, stumbled through the first half. He 
finished with 18 points and nine rebounds, but had only four points at 
halftime. He had only three at halftime Saturday in a loss to Utah, but 
finished with 23. 
</P>
<P>
Herdman, whose seven points against Maryland in the stretch helped cut the lead 
to four with about five minutes to play, also finished with 18. He also added 
eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine played its second consecutive game without starting guard Dylan Rigdon, 
who was out with a hip flexor but might return Saturday against San Diego 
State. 
</P>
<P>
"We missed Rigdon," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
About the time the rest of the team was taping its ankles before the game in 
College Park, starting guard Dylan Rigdon was standing in street clothes, 
shooting baskets with a friend in the Bren Center. He has not played the past 
two games because of a hip flexor, but hopes to be ready to play Saturday 
against San Diego State in San Diego. "I'll probably be out of shape and out of 
sync," Rigdon said. He did not travel with the team because he needed to be 
able to undergo rehabilitation in Irvine. The only other time Rigdon has missed 
a trip was last season against Nevada Las Vegas. "I didn't get picked to go," 
Rigdon said, smiling. He was a freshman at the time, and had yet to show the 
form that helped him average 17 points in the final nine regular-season games. 
. . . Don May, a 6-9 senior center who wound up at point guard Saturday during 
a loss to Utah, started the second half at forward in place of Jeff Von Lutzow, 
whom Coach Bill Mulligan played for only one minute in the second half. Von 
Lutzow, a sophomore, made two of eight shots and scored eight points with one 
rebound in 14 minutes. "Don May did a great job. He was magnificent," Mulligan 
said. "He's never played that position before, and he had never played (point 
guard) before last Saturday." May had two points, five rebounds, a block and an 
assist. Von Lutzow's status as a starter is unclear. "He isn't doing anything," 
Mulligan said. "His mind isn't with it."

BERTOLUCCI'S DESERT OF THE SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The New Yorkers of "The Sheltering Sky" (AMC Century 14), Port and Kit Moresby, 
are expatriates of the late 1940s, aware that they are living through the dying 
fall of their marriage as they travel the world with no urgency about their 
return, or about anything else for that matter. Disinterested now in America, 
they've sailed to Tangier, with crushing amounts of luggage and the hope of 
finding the enlightenment that has eluded them on their other exotic treks. 
</P>
<P>
When Paul Bowles created the Moresbys in 1949 in his novel, which soon reached 
cult status, Port and Kit and their desultory rush toward oblivion in the North 
African desert hit a nerve with more than a few readers. Here was their 
latter-day Scott and Zelda: Port, a composer, Kit a playwright/diarist, worldly 
and "artistic," drawn to the abyss with the inevitability of lemmings and the 
elegance of tango dancers. 
</P>
<P>
Little wonder Bowles' ascetic, unadorned prose, which ended in a blaze of 
precisely recorded sensuality, held readers. His story mirrored both 
existential and universal pain: a couple whose "sentimental bonds" weren't 
enough to hold together a marriage in shards. Then too, there was the teasing 
wonder of how close the novel came to Bowles' private life with his 
high-strung, talented wife, short-story writer/playwright Jane Bowles, who 
lived in an impenetrable thicket of fears and melancholies. 
</P>
<P>
Bowles called "The Sheltering Sky" "an adventure story in which the adventures 
take place on two planes simultaneously: in the actual desert and in the inner 
desert of the spirit." And in that inner desert, "sexual adventures fail to 
provide relief. The shade is insufficient, the glare is always brighter as the 
journey continues. And the journey must continue -- there is no oasis in which 
one can remain." 
</P>
<P>
Tricky stuff for film. But Bernardo Bertolucci -- with his impeccable 
production team, especially his great mind's eye, cinematographer Vittorio 
Storaro -- almost has it within his grasp. As the Moresbys, John Malkovich and 
Debra Winger are superb at suggesting a couple quiveringly attuned to each 
other's needs and neuroses after a decade of marriage, yet tragically unable to 
connect. 
</P>
<P>
And from the film's first moment there is a sense of place both terrifyingly 
vast and stifling. It's unthinkable that one could even cast a shadow on this 
Sahara, much less imprint oneself on its landmark-free expanses, while the inky 
tunnel-like passageways of its old villages promise danger at the every turn. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sheltering Sky," however, is a story of the loss of identity, the 
disintegration of the personality in the impersonal otherness of the North 
African desert. The sexual odyssey that seals it must be absolutely 
soul-obliterating. Bewilderingly, Bertolucci -- of all directors -- and 
co-screenwriter Mark Peploe have sentimentalized and softened this section so 
that the movie crumbles into a lofty soft-core travelogue with madness for its 
fade-out. 
</P>
<P>
The movie may work for the reader who has just put down Bowles' novel, with all 
the tensions and intrigues of its subtext still freshly in mind. To others, 
Kit, Port and Tunner, their upper-class, not-overbright traveling companion 
(newcomer Campbell Scott), may seem querulous and exhausting. 
</P>
<P>
The three form a triangle of sorts, with a vile English travel-writer mother 
and her son (Jill Bennett and Timothy Spall) as overripe comic relief. Tunner, 
who has money and the indefatigable cheer of a summer-stock juvenile, is 
dazzled by Kit, pursuing her without any sense of what life with a 
high-maintainance neurotic entails. 
</P>
<P>
Kit functions each day from an elaborate system of omens; a scraped knee or a 
spilled glass of water is a sign for something else, rarely anything good. Port 
is used to humoring her, holding her hand through her encyclopedic fears, 
rubbing her tummy on demand. But when Kit explains away their separate bedrooms 
to Tunner, airily saying, "The first rule of marriage is never confuse it with 
sex," she's also defining the gulf between her and her passive, sexually 
blocked husband. 
</P>
<P>
The most telling scene between Port and Kit is their attempt to lose themselves 
in lovemaking, after bicycling to a high desert ridge outside the village of 
Boussif. With part of the desert shadowed beneath them like a spreading ink 
blot, they try desperately to obliterate their separateness, but it's as sharp 
and distinct as the stones they're lying on. Miserably, they pull apart, and 
not even their mutual assurances of love can take away the pathos or the 
emptiness. (This and other explicit sexual encounters and the film's unabashed 
nudity are reasons for its R rating.) 
</P>
<P>
Eluding Tunner, the Moresbys find catastrophe in their path: Port's passport is 
stolen, they run into a black rain of flies, illness dogs them. But the fervor 
with which Port rushes them deeper and deeper into the Sahara makes it clear 
that whatever their destiny is to be, the Moresbys are racing forward to 
embrace it. 
</P>
<P>
When fate separates them, Kit stumbles onto the traveling caravan of the 
blue-turbaned Tuareg tribesman Belquassim (Eric Vu-An), but it's the film that 
loses its way. In the novel, Belquassim's unquestioned sexual authority and 
Kit's submission to it were obligatory steps toward the shattering ending. 
Bertolucci, full of "the ecstasy of improvisation," has declared that Bowles 
was fantasizing and has created a prettified, delicate sexual fantasy in its 
place for Winger and Bejart ballet dancer Vu-An. 
</P>
<P>
This, from the maker of "Last Tango in Paris"? It's unfathomable. Not even 
Bertolucci's use of the sad-eyed, 80-year-old Bowles himself, interacting with 
his own characters, is as disastrous a misstep -- although it comes close. 
</P>
<P>
Bertolucci and Bowles are in any case an odd pairing: the elegantly spare 
writer whose eye is fixed on a finite point of nothingness and one of the 
screen's most swooningly lush sensualists. The wonder is that as much of "The 
Sheltering Sky" works as well as it does.

'HAVANA': ALL SMOKE, NO FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When "Casablanca" was remade for television a number of years back, with David 
Soul in the Bogart role, everybody scoffed. Now we have a new remake, and it's 
called "Havana." The filmmakers aren't calling it a remake, of course and, 
strictly speaking, they're right. Still, what's the dividing line between 
affectionate tribute and rip-off? "Havana," scripted by Judith Rascoe and David 
Rayfiel, doesn't even proffer an "inspired by" credit. 
</P>
<P>
Set in Havana on the eve of the Castro revolution, this Sydney Pollack 
production stars Robert Redford as Jack Weil, a wayward, high-stakes American 
poker player who falls hard for the Swedish wife (the Swedish Lena Olin) of an 
anti-Batista "freedom fighter" (an uncredited Raul Julia). When Jack isn't 
acting all smoldery and moony in his bachelor pad, he's rustling up action in a 
glittering nightspot presided over by a ceremonious, sardonic type played by 
Alan Arkin. 
</P>
<P>
If we were supposed to swoon before all these "Casablanca"-style echoes, the 
strategy backfired. It's not enough to draw on the familiar plot contrivances 
of a classic romance; you also have to provide the spirit that infused that 
romance. "Havana" (selected theaters) doesn't provide much spirit -- it's 
lethargic when it's supposed to be dreamy. But even if it were better it might 
still not be very satisfying. We don't take our romantic myths in the same way 
that we did 48 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The problem starts with Redford and his role. Turning down an offer to assist 
the rebels, Jack says "it'd be against my principles, if I had any." The line 
is such an anti-hero cliche that we can practically see the quotation marks 
hanging in the cigar smoke-filled air. Jack is supposed to be a drifter who 
needs the love of a fiery, politically committed woman to revive him to his own 
best self. 
</P>
<P>
But, even in the worst of circumstances, Jack seems strapped in by nobility, 
and as for Lena Olin's Bobby Duran, she manages to find her way into Jack's 
arms -- and bed -- rather rapidly after her husband's apparent demise. She's 
all too willing to ditch the revolution and vamoose to California with Jack. 
Sexual passion acts as a kind of amnesia-inducing drug in this film (rated R 
for occasional violence, strong language, and brief nudity). You get the 
feeling that if only more people in Havana had looked like Redford and Olin, 
maybe Castro might have failed. And, despite the film's pro-Castro slant, the 
pre-Castro sin-city Havana that we're supposed to be bemoaning actually looks 
like a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
The lovers' passion might have been convincing if there was more going on 
between the co-stars. Taken individually, both Redford and Olin look like 
romantic icons; they're appropriately glossy, larger than life. You don't 
really mind it that Redford seems a bit too old for the role, or that Olin, 
even after her character has been tortured, looks like she's just been to the 
sauna. But halfway through the film I stared at the screen as the two lovers 
gazed deeply into each other's eyes -- and then I jotted down "no chemistry" in 
my note pad. 
</P>
<P>
Redford is one of Hollywood's premiere romantic actors despite, or because of, 
the fact that he often closes himself off from any deep emotional connection 
with his partners. He didn't always do this: he was convincingly ardent 
opposite Barbra Streisand in Pollack's "The Way We Were," and it's probably the 
best performance he's ever given. 
</P>
<P>
But that was a while ago; so, for that matter, was his last film, the abysmal 
1986 "Legal Eagles," where his partner in non-chemistry was Debra Winger. 
Perhaps Redford would loosen up if he acted more but, as it is, his infrequent 
appearances are armored in impassivity. All that suitable-for-framing anti-hero 
nobility of his is a drag. 
</P>
<P>
Olin, in only her third English-language film, already seems like an actress 
primed for major roles. But "Havana" isn't even major pulp -- if it was, many 
of us would have been more than happy to sit through it. As a young woman 
Olin's Bobby is supposed to have left Sweden for Hollywood in the hopes of 
becoming an actress like her idol, Garbo. It's a sneaky ploy; we in the 
audience are being nudged by the filmmakers to see Olin in Garbo-esque terms, 
and it's a disservice to Olin, who has her own ravishing emotionalism to draw 
on. She doesn't need her role's aura of Garbo-tinged exotica any more than 
Redford needs his Bogey-misfit vibes. 
</P>
<P>
If Pollack had heightened the swoony romanticism of his Havana, he might have 
bought off the film's mildewed ardor. But his period re-creations are 
scrupulously realistic, more realistic than anything he sets up between his 
people. He seems torn between making a great, old-style doomed lovers romance 
and a serious, politically committed epic, and he succeeds at neither. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the romantic old-movie cliches that "Havana" attempts to dredge up 
have long since passed into camp. It's a mistake, I think, to play them 
straight. However much we may want to re-experience "Casablanca," we can't go 
home again using the same old roadmap.

GERHARD SAMUEL LEADS MONDAY EVENING CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The great sorrow of contemporary music is not a lack of premieres, but the 
inconsistent performance histories afterwards. New music specialists, 
struggling to keep abreast of current production, can seldom afford the luxury 
of looking back, and nobody else seems to care. 
</P>
<P>
Which leaves works such as Henze's "Kammermusik 1958" all dressed up in robes 
of acclaim with nowhere to go. Rare performances of it tend to settle in memory 
with the weight of myth. 
</P>
<P>
The performance on the latest Monday Evening Concert, at Bing Theater of the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Art, may not be the stuff of legend but it amply 
demonstrated the power and grace, the fertile imagination and sensitive 
text-setting of the piece. A big, formally clear song cycle with revelatory 
instrumental interludes, "Kammermusik 1958" is both immediately ingratiating 
and stubbornly persistent in the ear. 
</P>
<P>
Gerhard Samuel, a familiar champion of contemporary music here since his days 
as associate conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in the early 1970s, led 
an octet of local virtuosos in a deft, occasionally blocky account that found 
its greatest inspiration at the most crucial point, the aching bittersweet 
benediction of the Adagio epilogue. 
</P>
<P>
Tenor Randall Gremillion and guitarist David Tanenbaum were the protagonists, 
in music written for Peter Pears and Julian Bream. Gremillion did not sound in 
the best of voice, but he used his resources with intelligence, articulating 
the often convolute lines cleanly and let the febrile music carry Holderlin's 
allusive text naturally, lucid on the surface but with dark manias never far 
away. 
</P>
<P>
Tanenbaum is well-practiced in Henze's music, and he supported Gremillion with 
flexible point. He played the three Tientos with fluent drive and expressive 
nuance, firmly projected. 
</P>
<P>
The pertinent, well-chosen program also featured a world premiere, Samuel's 
"Outcries and Consolations" for 13 players. It reflects much of the 
instrumental language and color of Henze, in a vivid, fragmented collection of 
thematic parodies. It shares some of the emotional subtexts of "Kammermusik," 
in the nervous outcries and shimmering consolations. 
</P>
<P>
The two "Kammermusik" soloists also had independent vehicles. Tanenbaum, 
however, proved virtually inaudible in the austere Sonata of Peter Maxwell 
Davies, even when not overwhelmed by the astonishing audience noise level in 
the hall. 
</P>
<P>
Gremillion acted skillfully in the "Melodrama" from Berio's iconoclastic 
"Opera." He spoke with neurotic, stagy purpose and sang urgently in the 
structurally rigorous, climatic absurdist monologue. Samuel and the MEC forces 
backed him with accommodating flair. JOHN HENKEN

CHAMBER GROUP OFFERS MESSIAEN 'QUARTET' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Olivier Messiaen's "Quartet for the End of Time" is music that makes massive 
demands on performers, both technical and spiritual. A successful performance 
requires not only a foursome of virtuosos, but believers as well. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night in Gindi Auditorium at the University of Judaism, the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic Chamber Music Society presented the work with a capable ensemble 
of Philharmonic musicians bravely attempting the nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Without undue effortfulness, the group -- violinist Camille Avellano, cellist 
Barry Gold, clarinetist David Howard, pianist Gloria Cheng -- successfully 
hurdled the work's technical obstacles. But its mystical elements remained 
elusive. 
</P>
<P>
The players brought considerable expressivity to most of the piece -- this was 
not a cold run-through -- yet, nevertheless, it fell short. The performance was 
typified by the group's traversal of "Danse de la fureur," its unison 
syncopated lines played with jazzy precision but missing the quality of "huge 
blocks of livid fury or ice-like frenzy" the composer seeks. 
</P>
<P>
Gold offered the cello solo movement in one sweeping arch with an intriguingly 
varied vibrato, but his playing never reached the extatique heights called for 
in the score. Howard created expectancy in his movement, then denied it. Cheng 
pounded powerfully, and remained earthbound. This was a respectable, clearly 
laid out performance, just not an overwhelming one. 
</P>
<P>
On the first half of the program, violinists Elizabeth Baker and Mitchell 
Newman, violist Meredith Snow and cellist Gloria Lum performed Debussy's String 
Quartet. Again, the ensemble impressed most apparently from a technical 
standpoint: Taut phrasing, rhythmic exactness and unanimity of purpose 
characterized the reading. And though the performance emerged restrained 
emotionally, it seemed not entirely unsuited to the music -- a valid approach, 
if not the approach. TIMOTHY MANGAN

SKILLS WITHOUT THRILLS AT CALTECH CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Janos Starker, aloof, magisterial, the great stone face of the cello, and 
Menahem Pressler, that most animated and passionate of pianists, proved an 
oddly matched pair at their Coleman Concerts recital in Beckman Auditorium at 
Caltech on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In an afternoon of orderly, low-key music making, Pressler consistently 
deferred to his partner in what should have been a melding of the disparate 
strengths of two commanding artists. 
</P>
<P>
Starker seemed particularly ungenerous with emotional nuance and variety of 
tone, whipping speedily, sometimes perfunctorily through three core components 
of the repertory: Brahms' Sonata in E minor, the Debussy Sonata, and 
Beethoven's Opus 69. Pressler offered consistently polished work, but with only 
a fraction of the dynamism we expect of him. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there were rewards in encountering the Brahms sonata in such an 
uncluttered reading as theirs, and the notes, if not all the mysteries, were 
for once projected in Debussy's elusive work, which Starker executed with 
sovereign control. 
</P>
<P>
Rhythmic acuity and lack of affection were not enough, however, in Beethoven's 
sonata, which demands a more heroic stance, more drama and weight of tone than 
was encountered on this occasion. HERBERT GLASS

TALLIS SCHOLARS IN PRISTINE FORM

<P>
For sophisticated seasonal joy, it would be hard to beat the concert by the 
Tallis Scholars Sunday evening. The British vocal group offered an unhackneyed 
gathering of high Renaissance glories for a large Chamber Music in Historic 
Sites audience, thoroughly packing Westminster Presbyterian Church in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The program began with Palestrina, "Hodie Christus natus est," and the 
sweepingly lyrical Mass "Ut re mi fa sol la." The motet emerged dry and rather 
slow, but the 10 singers proved in perfect accord with the gentle, generous 
music of the Mass, pristine in production and blend. 
</P>
<P>
Interpretively, director Peter Phillips is an unexceptional centrist. That's 
not surprising, considering that over the past decade his much-recorded and 
well-traveled Tallis Scholars have indeed become the performance mainstream in 
Renaissance sacred choral music. Singing one or two to a part, the Tallis 
Scholars concentrate on unified textures, pure sound, supple lines and textual 
point. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips does not favor tempo extremes, but maintains momentum and direction 
easily. He responds urgently to the demands of the word setting, and 
distinguishes clearly between individual styles. 
</P>
<P>
That was readily apparent on the second half, which opened with highly 
contrasting settings of "Rorate caeli" by Francisco Guerrero, Jacob Handl and 
William Byrd. The smooth, sublimated intensity of the Guerrero became an almost 
shouted demand in the Handl, and settled into characteristic dark mystery for 
the Byrd. 
</P>
<P>
The Scholars' sensitivity to word-painting was demonstrated throughout, but 
most obviously in the long narrative motet "Cum natus esset Iesus" by Orlande 
de Lassus. Richly varied singing -- still maintaining the miracle of completely 
independent linear nuance within complete ensemble integrity -- projected the 
stylized drama of the visit of the Magi. 
</P>
<P>
Settings of "O magnum mysterium" by Byrd and Palestrina, and short pieces by 
Heinrich Isaac -- the disconcertingly odd "Ecce Virgo concipiet," a stylistic 
and chronological loner on the program -- and Hans Hassler completed the 
evening. J.H.

LAWSUIT SEEKS REMOVAL OF HANUKKAH MENORAH; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAY: AMERICAN JEWISH CONGRESS SAYS 28-FOOT DISPLAY IN BEVERLY HILLS PARK 
VIOLATES CONSTITUTIONAL SEPARATION OF RELIGION AND STATE. BACKERS CLAIM IT IS 
SYMBOLICALLY SIMILAR TO PRESENCE OF A CHRISTMAS TREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The American Jewish Congress and four Jewish residents of Beverly Hills have 
filed a federal civil rights suit against the city of Beverly Hills in an 
effort to force the removal of a 28-foot Hanukkah menorah from a municipal park 
bordering Santa Monica Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The large candelabra was installed by Chabad, a Brooklyn-based movement of 
Hasidic Jews, which has sought for years to obtain the same prominence in 
public places for the Hanukkah symbol as is given to Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
But Carol Plotkin, associate director for the American Jewish Congress' local 
office, said her group believes minority rights are best served by barring all 
such objects. 
</P>
<P>
"There are plenty of opportunities to put up creches or menorahs or any other 
religious object on private property. Government should be free of any 
religious objects," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed Monday, the day the menorah was installed. The menorah is a 
symbol of the eight-day Hanukkah holiday, which celebrates the rededication of 
the temple in Jerusalem after a victory over foreign occupiers 2,100 years ago. 
The holiday began Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
It is marked by the exchange of gifts, the eating of traditional foods and the 
lighting of candles in menorahs, one for each night until all eight candles are 
in place. The Chabad menorah is scheduled to be lit at a celebration on Sunday 
that is expected to draw 2,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills City Atty. Greg Stepanicich defended the city's approval of the 
Chabad menorah, saying that state and federal courts have allowed holiday 
displays if they make a larger statement about "cultural diversity and 
pluralism." 
</P>
<P>
"In our case, we do have a lighted Christmas tree, a lighted 'Seasons 
Greetings' sign, and now we've allowed the menorah as part of that overall 
holiday message," Stepanicich said. The city also pays for lighted signs 
showing carolers and other traditional Christmas figures over main streets in 
the Beverly Hills business district, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stepanicich noted that in a landmark case last year, the U.S. Supreme Court 
allowed the display of a menorah and a Christmas tree side by side in the entry 
of a county building in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
But Plotkin said that because of its size and prominence, the Beverly Hills 
menorah amounts to a "stand-alone display" during the day. The Christmas tree 
and the "Seasons Greetings" sign are far less visible except when lit at night. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Boruch Shlomo Cunin, West Coast director for Chabad, was out of town and 
not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall B. Grossman, Chabad's attorney, said that the electrified carolers in 
the commercial district are "out-and-out Christmas decorations and nobody 
objects to that, but when it comes to a menorah that attracts thousands of 
people in the celebration of this season, the American Jewish Congregation 
yells foul." 
</P>
<P>
In their suit, which was filed with the help of the American Civil Liberties 
Union, the plaintiffs charged that the city violated the 1st Amendment's ban on 
the official establishment of religion. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, they said, the City Council -- all five members of which are 
Jewish -- was wrong when it voted earlier this year to allow the display of 
"any and all" religious symbols on public land. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Allan L. Alexander declined to comment on the suit, but he said that the 
decision had proven so controversial that the City Council plans to reopen the 
question at a public hearing in January. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the American Jewish Congress, a civil rights organization 
claiming 4,000 members locally and 50,000 nationwide, the plaintiffs are Eve 
Slaff, widow of former Beverly Hills Mayor George Slaff, Alan Sieroty, a former 
state assemblyman and state senator, and Devera Lurie Waldman and Charles 
Waldman. 
</P>
<P>
All four live in Beverly Hills and they pass the site of the menorah 
frequently, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm opposed to using public grounds for that purpose," Slaff said. "My 
husband, George, before he died was very active on this particular issue, so 
I'm carrying on his position."

THERE'S CONFUSION IN THE AIR ON A DAY FIT FOR UMBRELLAS AND SUNGLASSES

Thirteen more days until Christmas and Los Angeles is a real winter wonderland 
all right -- everybody's wondering if winter is ever coming to this land. 
</P>
<P>
The stockings are hung by the chimney, the tinsel's on the tree. 'Tis most 
certainly the season, but what season? A couple of weeks ago there was frost on 
the lawn, last weekend you could have roasted chestnuts on the sidewalk and 
today they say it might rain. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so cold in the morning and cold at night and in the daytime it's hot. 
They say it's going to be 65 and all of a sudden it's 80. You don't even know 
what to wear," Ani Sinanian of Glendale muttered while her 7-year-old daughter, 
Stephanie, waited in line at the Beverly Center shopping mall to visit Santa, 
who looked decidedly overdressed. 
</P>
<P>
The weather has been anything but predictable. And if clothes make a statement, 
then confusion reigned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
There was fake snow in the window of Ed Debevic's restaurant on La Cienega 
Boulevard, but the customers were in tank tops. Russ Giguere, a middle-age rock 
'n' roll singer, was shopping in his tennis togs while Steven Webb, a Beverly 
Hills attorney, turned out in a wool cap, wool vest and tweed coat so he could 
buy a couple of wool shirts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it rained once when I was 5," Giguere recalled. "I run and walk and 
ride my bicycle whenever it isn't raining -- which is all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The publicity department at Columbia Pictures in Culver City decorated its 
Christmas tree Friday night. By Monday morning most of the needles had fallen 
off. 
</P>
<P>
"We came in and the thing was dead," one secretary noted. "It looks like a 
broom." 
</P>
<P>
At the Mr. Green Trees tree lot in Beverly Hills, which sells Christmas trees 
to the rich and famous, tree keeper Troy Startoni was going to great lengths to 
keep fresh the $350, 11-foot noble fir on layaway for Bruce Springsteen, not to 
mention a $300 model personally picked out by Mitzi Gaynor, along with $70 
worth of garland to grace the staircase in her Hollywood penthouse. 
</P>
<P>
It was at least 10 degrees cooler under the red and white striped tent Startoni 
uses to feign winter for his trees, handpicked from Oregon, watered three times 
and sprayed at least twice a day. Asked if he felt a twinge of guilt, 
considering California is in a four-year drought with no end in sight, the 
26-year-old part-time actor replied: "What drought?" 
</P>
<P>
The word went out Tuesday morning -- 30% chance of rain. But anyone who has 
spent more than five winters here would read the forecast this way: 70% chance 
it won't rain. After all, that wasn't Jack Frost nipping at their noses last 
weekend, it was the Santa Anas, chapping it. 
</P>
<P>
"I am seriously considering doing a rain dance," gray-haired Sid Davis said to 
her husband, George, over tuna fish sandwiches at the Beverly Center. 
</P>
<P>
Still, meteorologists are talking scattered showers by this afternoon. OK, so 
it probably won't be more than a quarter-inch. Diana Thompson will take 
whatever she can get. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh please, please," Thompson implored, confessing that the last time it rained 
her entire family lit a fire in their Anaheim den and stayed up all night, 
savoring the sound of every drop that bounced above their beamed ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard going Christmas shopping when you have to stop for water to avoid 
dehydration," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rain or no rain, Lynzie Flynn-Zimmerman, born and raised here, is getting out. 
She and her husband are heading north, "where they have seasons," she said, 
stopping to purchase a beige, fur-trimmed parka rated for 70 below. They were 
marked down from $425 to $339.99 at Eddie Bauer's, where they weren't exactly 
having a run on sub-zero parkas. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm probably the only one buying this," Flynn-Zimmerman said disgustedly. 
"It's summer here all year around. If I wanted that, I'd move to Tahiti."

SUPERVISORIAL ELECTION; 
</P>
<P>
BOARD PREPARES FOR NEW DISTRICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day after the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for a Jan. 22 election in 
a new 1st District, Los Angeles County supervisors Tuesday began making 
arrangements to represent their new, court-drawn districts. 
</P>
<P>
Files have to be swapped. Signs in district offices have to be changed. New 
maps must be printed. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Ed Edelman proposed a Jan. 1 date for completing the transition, 
while Supervisor Deane Dana proposed Jan. 22, to coincide with the election. A 
decision was put off until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, new supervisorial district boundaries have been in effect for a 
month, but the supervisors have continued to represent their old districts -- 
the ones found by the courts to discriminate against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors were waiting to see if the Supreme Court would hear the 
county's appeal in the voting rights case. The high court Monday refused to 
postpone the Jan. 22 election but did not act on the county's request for a 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Dana and Edelman said the supervisors should not wait. 
</P>
<P>
"I am up for reelection in about 18 months," Dana said. "I certainly would like 
to get to know my constituents before I run." 
</P>
<P>
Edelman added: "It is time to put this litigation behind us once and for all so 
that we can get on with the pressing business of county government." 
</P>
<P>
The new political map, drafted by civil rights groups and approved by U.S. 
District Judge David V. Kenyon, shifts supervisors to many new neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Dana said he needs to become familiar with his new 4th District, which picked 
up part of the San Gabriel Valley from Supervisor Pete Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
"I know absolutely nothing about the area out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman's 3rd District lost East Los Angeles to the 1st District, represented 
by Schabarum. Edelman also gained Malibu and Santa Monica from Dana and more of 
the San Fernando Valley from Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich's 5th District, which still includes Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena, 
moved farther east into the San Gabriel Valley to pick up neighborhoods in the 
old 1st District. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn's 2nd District picked up Compton from Dana. 
</P>
<P>
Richard B. Dixon, the county's chief administrative officer, said of the 
transition: "It is just a bureaucratic housekeeping that we have to do so when 
we say to a supervisor, 'This is in your district,' we're saying it to the 
right supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have to re-educate ourselves to show that a project in Hacienda Heights 
now is in District 4 instead of 1 and a project in Bunker Hills is in 1 instead 
of 3," Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich was out of the country and could not be reached. A spokesman said 
Hahn supports completing the transition Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum, who is retiring, showed little interest in the changes. "I have a 
substantial agenda that is going to be pursued by me and my office to March 8," 
the date when Schabarum's successor is expected to take office. "Whether they 
change the boundaries or whatever they do doesn't mean one damn thing to me." 
</P>
<P>
By law, district lines are used only for voting purposes. Customarily, 
supervisors govern their huge districts like fiefdoms, deferring to the 
supervisor of the district on purely local matters. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear what effect the changes will have on projects or services. One 
likely result is a change in the pace of development in neighborhoods shifting 
from Antonovich and Dana, who are regarded as pro-development, to Edelman, a 
slow-growth advocate. 
</P>
<P>
Dana demonstrated Tuesday how his work is cut out for him in adjusting to his 
new district. During an interview by a reporter for the Inland Valley Daily 
Bulletin, which is circulated in the eastern San Gabriel Valley, Dana asked, 
"Where is the Daily Bulletin?"

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BELLFLOWER COUNCIL VOTES TOUGH ANTI-SMOKING 
LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bellflower City Council this week passed one of the county's strictest 
anti-smoking laws, banning smoking in all of the city's restaurants and in 
virtually every building to which the public has access. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which is expected to receive final council approval in January, 
mandates that smoking be prohibited in restaurants, public areas of galleries, 
libraries and museums, video arcades and meeting rooms open to the public, 
among other places. 
</P>
<P>
Employers are required to designate smoking areas in work areas and ban smoking 
in auditoriums, classrooms and elevators. Bars, tobacco stores, malls, private 
offices, residences and places of worship have been exempted from the law, 
which is expected to go into effect in February. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Randy Bomgaars said the council is concerned about the effects of 
secondhand smoke and felt it had to take a drastic step to protect nonsmokers.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HERMOSA BEACH ORDERED TO RESTRICT PCH 
PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After battling with the state for more than 20 years over rush-hour congestion 
on Pacific Coast Highway, Hermosa Beach has been given 60 days to do its part 
for commuters by restricting curbside parking along its stretch of the 
thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
In a Dec. 3 letter, J.B. Baxter, District 7 director for the state Department 
of Transportation, warned that unless Hermosa Beach officials provide a 
no-stopping zone on the west side of the highway during the evening rush, 
Caltrans will do it for them. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach has consistently argued that the parking ban would put merchants 
out of business and create an expressway in the heart of town. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans spokesman Karl F. Berger said the agency usually backs away from 
forcing a city to institute a parking ban, preferring to rely on cooperation. 
He said the state was forced to act when employers in surrounding cities 
complained that the parked cars were creating a regional traffic problem.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE GRANTS INCREASED POWER TO WATER 
AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has granted increased authority to a 
nine-member board seeking to oversee cleanup of extensive ground water 
pollution in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Over the objections of environmentalists, the Main San Gabriel Basin 
Watermaster had sought expanded powers to fill the leadership void in one of 
the West's worst water pollution problems. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Florence T. Pickard ruled this week that the water agency can have more 
control over pumping by water suppliers, but must also hold public hearings as 
part of any cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials said the judge's decision solves a key jurisdictional problem. 
Environmentalists, who advocate creation of a regional super-agency to deal 
with the pollution, also claimed victory. They cited the judge's mandate that 
in the case of any conflicts, the Watermaster must defer to public agencies 
such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW CLASS SITES STUDIED FOR EXPELLED 
STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles school officials said Tuesday that they are no longer considering 
Hughes Junior High School in Woodland Hills as a potential site to house 
classes for students expelled from regular schools because of weapons 
possession or assaults. 
</P>
<P>
The district instead is exploring several options, including housing such 
students at some of the 38 adult education schools throughout Los Angeles or at 
sites used by dropout prevention programs, said Barry Mostovoy, administrative 
consultant for school operations. 
</P>
<P>
Mostovoy said community opposition played a role in the district's decision to 
drop Hughes, a closed school used for administrative offices, as a possible 
site. School board member Julie Korenstein, who represents Woodland Hills, 
opposed the proposal, as did City Councilwoman Joy Picus. 
</P>
<P>
Both officials said they had received complaints from nearby residents who 
feared an increase in crime and lower property values in the neighborhood.

A Los Angeles police officer who gained a national reputation for his anti-gang 
efforts in the South-Central part of the city has been found guilty of three 
administrative charges of insubordination and faces the possibility of being 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Carl McGill, who has been featured by the national media for his 
community projects helping young gang members, was disciplined for a series of 
incidents last year in which he angrily confronted a police supervisor whom he 
suspected of searching his car while he was home on sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
Worried about his police career, McGill was reluctant to discuss the situation 
Tuesday. He suggested that a civilian review board be created for the Police 
Department because he believes management does not always support rank-and-file 
officers who try to fight crime by becoming more involved in their community. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they would see it from more of a non-biased point of view," McGill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cmdr. William Booth, the Los Angeles Police Department's chief spokesman, said 
the case against the 31-year-old McGill has nothing to do with gang-fighting 
tactics. Booth said the case centered on McGill's alleged insubordination. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that the five-year veteran was found guilty Monday of making improper 
remarks to his supervisor, failing to comply with a supervisor's order, and not 
having permission to work as a school security guard while he was on sick 
status from his police duties. He was found innocent of failing to properly 
notify his supervisor that he was sick. 
</P>
<P>
The punishment for McGill, which is to be announced Friday, ranges from an 
official reprimand to termination. 
</P>
<P>
Booth also dismissed McGill's recommendation that a civilian review board be 
established to defend officers who now must appear before Board of Rights 
hearings convened by police managers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're staunchly opposed to it," Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
"But on the other hand," he added, "we have the ultimate in civilian control in 
that the head of the department is a board of civilians -- the Board of Police 
Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission is far, far superior to what is commonly thought of as a 
civilian review board." 
</P>
<P>
McGill has received state and national accolades for his work conducting 
anti-gang programs at schools and community centers in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
His problems began last fall, when he learned from his stepbrother that while 
he was at a doctor's appointment, two police supervisors came to his home and, 
finding that he was gone, searched his car for evidence that he was not sick. 
McGill said he angrily confronted one of the supervisors the next day, which 
led to some of the administrative charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
In lengthy Board of Rights hearings, McGill tried to persuade a panel of three 
police captains that he was provoked into the argument. 
</P>
<P>
McGill said he fears that even if he is not fired Friday, his police career in 
Los Angeles is finished. "The people involved in this have basically destroyed 
my career," he said.

RAM UPDATE;

<P>
PLAYOFF OBLIVION HAS BECOME AS SIMPLE AS 1 + 1

<P>
A loss to San Francisco Monday night at Anaheim Stadium combined with a victory 
by either Green Bay, Minnesota or Dallas Sunday would mathematically eliminate 
the Rams from a chance at the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Even if they beat the 49ers, however, their postseason chances are slim because 
of disadvantages in the tiebreaking system. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have lost to both the Packers and the Cowboys, and the Vikings have 
the advantage in games against common opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"The loss (to the Saints) takes us out of any realistic playoff hopes, I 
think," Coach John Robinson said. "I think the focus we'll put on the (49er) 
game is the same, with or without the loss, but it would have been more 
exciting going in with a three-game win streak." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams used every defensive look they could think of against the 49ers during 
their 28-17 victory at Candlestick Park on Nov. 25, and quarterback Joe Montana 
acknowledged after the game that the 49ers had been confused. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams played a lot of nickel defense, daring the 49ers to run the ball. The 
New York Giants and the Cincinnati Bengals have since employed similar 
strategies, and both lost close games. But Robinson said the 49ers are starting 
their usual "December rush." 
</P>
<P>
"I think they are looking forward to establishing their running game now, much 
the same as they did last year," he said. JOHN WEYLER

LONG BEACH AND USC RENEW RIVALRY

<TEXT>
<P>
The rivalry between the USC and Cal State Long Beach women's basketball 
programs continues tonight, revitalized now that the Trojans have freshman 
standout Lisa Leslie in their lineup. 
</P>
<P>
USC won the recruiting battle for Leslie, who was considering Long Beach, and 
the Trojans -- 12-16 last season -- became the only losing team to make the 
preseason national rankings. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans (3-2) dropped out of the top 25 for the first time this season 
after losing at the University of San Francisco on Friday, 90-77. Long Beach is 
ranked 11th. 
</P>
<P>
USC has not defeated the 49ers since 1986 and enters tonight's game -- at 7:30 
at the Sports Arena -- behind, 23-12, in a series that started in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie, at 6 feet 5, averages a team-high 21.8 points and 14.2 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach (4-1) will rely on the quickness of its guards, who will probably 
try to lure Leslie into foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Trise Jackson leads four 49ers in double figures in scoring with a 16.6 
average. Center Kari Parriott, 6-2, will play opposite Leslie. She is averaging 
14.2 points and 12.4 rebounds. PETE THOMAS

NEW ALBUM, OLD SHOES KEEP LAINE ON THE RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

When celebrated pop crooner Frankie Laine -- whose 21 million-selling singles 
from the late 1940s to the middle '60s included "Mule Train," "I Believe," and 
"Rawhide" -- moved to Point Loma in 1968, it was purportedly to retire. 
</P>
<P>
He has yet to do so. In fact, he's getting ready to record a new album in New 
Orleans with jazz trumpeter Al Hirt. 
</P>
<P>
Laine had planned to start recording in January, but Hirt decided to get 
married, which has moved the sessions to March, around the time of Laine's 78th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"Al's getting married to some gal from Minnesota on Dec. 28, and we have to 
wait until he gets back from his honeymoon," Laine said. "And I'm allowing him 
plenty of time to get his honeymooning over with. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we're going to choose the songs, do the backgrounds, go over the 
arrangements, record everything and put the vocals in." 
</P>
<P>
The album, which doesn't yet have a title, will be recorded at a private studio 
owned by New Orleans band leader Ronnie Kole, a longtime friend of both Laine 
and Hirt. 
</P>
<P>
"Ronnie is kind of tying the whole thing together," Laine said. "I gave him the 
idea (for the collaboration) and he flipped and went after Al," Laine said. 
"He's got his own studio and his own record company; he's quite an 
entrepreneur." 
</P>
<P>
Joining Laine and Hirt in the studio will be reed siblings Wynton and Bradford 
Marsalis. "We're asking them each to do a cameo," Laine said. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential guest: Aaron Neville, the resident canary of New Orleans 
rhythm-and-blues group the Neville Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
"He seems to be doing a lot of guest appearances these days with people like 
Linda Ronstadt," Laine said, "and we're really hoping to get him." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Laine is keeping busy here in San Diego. Local nostalgia radio 
station KPOP-AM (1360) has put together a pre- Christmas promotion around one 
of his old songs, "Old Shoes," seeking donations of old shoes for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Laine and KPOP morning man Don Howard have cut a series of promo spots asking 
listeners to bring their old shoes to any Dixieline Lumber Home Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the people at Dixieline will take the shoes over to the St. Vincent De 
Paul Center so that Father Joe Carroll can disperse them to all the people who 
need them," Laine said. "So far, it's really going well. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got back from San Francisco, where KFRC-AM is picking up on it, and 
we're going to do the same thing up in Los Angeles, at KMPC-AM."

LINER NOTES: Veteran punk-rock singer-guitarist Lydia Lunch, who in the late 
1970s and early '80s fronted a series of crude hard-core groups including 
Teenage Jesus and the Jerks and Eight-Eyed Spy, is now on the lecture circuit 
and will be at the Casbah on Thursday night. Waxing poetic about such topical 
issues as abortion, censorship and war, she's part of the burgeoning Los 
Angeles spoken-word movement led by impresario Harvey Kubernik, whose 
"HollyWord" compilation album was recently released by Rhino Records. . . . 
</P>
<P>
After 17 years and 11 albums, heavy-metal also-rans Y&amp;T are breaking up. 
</P>
<P>
Their current farewell tour includes a stop Thursday night at the Bacchanal in 
Kearny Mesa. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tickets go on sale Friday at 3 p.m. for the Replacements' Jan. 20 concert at UC 
San Diego Price Center Ballroom. Opening will be the Posies. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: Mojo Nixon with the Forbidden Pigs, 
Thursday at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach; Bad Company with Damn Yankees, 
Friday at Golden Hall downtown; and the James Harman Band, Friday at the Belly 
Up Tavern.

With a big boost from the National Football League, ABC won the prime-time 
ratings race last week and moved a little closer to NBC in the season-to-date 
standings. The "Monday Night Football" game between the San Francisco 49ers and 
the New York Giants drew the largest audience in the program's 21-year history 
-- more than 41.5 million viewers, according to ABC. 
</P>
<P>
That easily ranked as the week's most-watched show and ABC was the most-watched 
network in prime time. NBC still leads overall in the 12-week-old season, but 
ABC has narrowed the lead to four-tenths of one ratings point. The full list of 
ratings is on F12. 
</P>
<P>
* If television response is any gauge, "Havana" may be in for trouble at the 
box office. A one-hour promotional special about the movie's star and director, 
"Robert Redford and Sydney Pollack: "The Men and Their Movies," drew only 9% of 
the available audience Sunday night and ranked 83rd among the week's 94 
prime-time programs. It ran fourth in its time period behind CBS' "Murder, She 
Wrote," ABC's "America's Funniest Home Videos" and "America's Funniest People" 
and Fox's "In Living Color" and "Get a Life." TV RATINGS

Operation Mark and Brian: KLOS-FM (95.5) morning drive-time duo Mark Thompson 
and Brian Phelps will broadcast their top-rated show from Saudi Arabia on 
Tuesday.

They'll make the 18-hour flight Monday on MGM Air as part of Operation Desert 
Cheer, which is transporting 15 tons of gifts for the servicemen. A satellite 
hook-up costing an estimated $15,000 will enable Tuesday's show to be heard 
live in Southern California. The pair hope to be able to broadcast telephone 
calls between servicemen and their families in the Los Angeles area. The 
usually irreverent deejays grew serious on the air Tuesday discussing their 
impending trip. "It's absolutely mind-boggling for us, a great honor," said 
Thompson. BETH KLEID

DARK MOMENTS, FEAR HAUNT THE FREED HOSTAGES

<P>
With joyous family reunions and yellow ribbons bedecking the Main Streets of 
dozens of small towns, America embraced its former hostages Tuesday, welcoming 
them home in time for the holidays after months of fear and uncertainty over 
their fate. 
</P>
<P>
But as they seek to adjust to normal life after four months as fugitives in 
Kuwait, or "human shields" in Iraq, many of the former hostages say they are 
haunted by chilling memories that not even the joys of a holiday homecoming can 
banish from their thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Simard, a construction company manager from Boston, remembers most 
vividly a moment that came suddenly and violently in the middle of the night, 
when about a dozen heavily armed Iraqi soldiers burst into his apartment in 
Kuwait city, taking him and several other foreigners hiding there prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
Talmadge C. Ledford, a defense contractor from Windham, N.H., remembers not so 
much a moment as a constant, gnawing fear that a "call would come from Baghdad" 
and that he and the other Westerners being held as human shields at a Kuwaiti 
oil installation would be executed. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no question in our minds" that if an order to kill them "came down 
from Saddam Hussein, it would have been followed," Ledford said. 
</P>
<P>
And Donald Latham, an Albuquerque, N.M., engineer working on a defense project 
in Kuwait, went through an experience that even now he will not talk about. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to say anything about that at all, OK? It just didn't happen. 
. . . Just forget it, please just forget it. . . ," he said when asked about 
news reports that he killed a looter who broke into his apartment one night. 
</P>
<P>
Whether they huddled in fear in darkened apartments and other hide-outs 
provided by resistance fighters in Kuwait or spent months in Iraq being moved 
in the middle of the night from one strategic site to another, the hundreds of 
Americans swept up in the crisis that erupted with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait 
on Aug. 2 all came home with tales of hardship, if not outright terror. 
</P>
<P>
One man, held at what he assumed to be a weapons testing complex southwest of 
Baghdad, lived with the sound of continual explosions -- and the fear that he 
and his fellow hostages would be killed not by a U.S. air strike but by "Iraqi 
incompetence" if a munitions test went awry. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland businessman Jeff Sanislo recalled the fear that made his stomach knot 
when Iraqi troops spotted him hiding on the roof of an apartment building in 
Kuwait city. To escape capture, he squeezed into a 2-foot-high box on the roof, 
waiting silently for four hours until Kuwaiti resistance forces helped him 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
"You pray a lot at a time like that," Sanislo said. "You think about family. . 
. . 'Will I ever get to see them again?' You get faith real quick." 
</P>
<P>
And yet for many former hostages recounting their stories, it wasn't the 
flashes of fear or the hardships of prison camp life that marked their ordeal 
so much as it was the boredom and the anxiety of not knowing how or when it 
would end. 
</P>
<P>
"The boredom was something that would just drive you up the wall," said Al 
Stone, a construction company manager from Las Vegas who spent more than three 
months hiding in a two-room apartment whose doors were welded shut by Kuwaitis 
attempting to keep him from being discovered. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the tension, the tension and the stress. Your stomach was always tied 
up in knots," said 69-year-old Eugene Hughes of Albuquerque, N.M., a former 
pilot who was visiting his stepson, Donald Latham, when the Iraqis invaded 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Iraqi troops surrounded the two-story villa where Hughes and 
Latham were hiding in Latham's second floor apartment. "They rang the bell and 
rattled the gate, but I guess they weren't sure we were inside because they 
went away eventually," Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Hogan, 54, of San Diego, urged President Bush to get tough. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't yet met a hostage who didn't want the military to come in and take 
it to him," Hogan said of Hussein. "He's nothing but a thug." 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the Americans who managed to evade the house-to-house searches by 
Iraqi troops, Hughes and Latham credited the Kuwaiti resistance with saving 
their lives -- sometimes at the cost of their own. 
</P>
<P>
"The people, the beautiful people of Kuwait kept us free," Hughes said in a 
voice choking with emotion. "They brought us food and kept our whereabouts 
secret. We would not be here today if it was not for them. 
</P>
<P>
"They're running an elaborate protection service for the foreigners there," 
added Latham. "Anyone who needs medical help, the resistance gets him a doctor. 
Anybody who needs food, they get him food. If you needed money, you got that 
too." 
</P>
<P>
John Gerald Jr., a lawyer from North Myrtle Beach, Va., said the flies and 
mosquitoes were "incessant" at the munitions testing site where he and six 
other foreigners were held. 
</P>
<P>
"Had the Iraqis allowed care packages through, my first request would have been 
for bug spray," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald said his Iraqi captors told him he was being held at a "screwdriver 
manufacturing plant" and that the bunkers he saw were "archeological digs." He 
said he assumed they were at a munitions testing site because of the periodic 
explosions he heard. "I never saw a single screwdriver," he added. 
</P>
<P>
While Gerald remained at the munitions site for his entire captivity, other 
hostages said they were moved from one site to another, always in the dead of 
night. Bill Rodebush, an oil rig maintenance engineer from McAlester, Okla., 
spent time at a heavily fortified chemical factory near the Syrian border, a 
hydroelectric plant near the Iranian frontier, a military complex in northern 
Iraq and an ammunition plant south of Baghdad. He said one of his captors told 
him the hostages were moved often because the officers didn't want them "to get 
friendly with any of our guards." 
</P>
<P>
For most of the human shields, as well as the fugitives in Kuwait, the light at 
the end of what one described as their "long and terrible tunnel" first 
appeared on Saturday, when word came through that Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein had ordered their release. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes recalled the sense of shock he felt Sunday at the sight of the streets 
of Kuwait city on the way to the airport where he and about 75 other Americans 
boarded a U.S.-chartered flight to Baghdad on the way to Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"When I arrived, it was such a beautiful city . . . but when I left, it was a 
garbage dump. Garbage was everywhere, and all the buildings were burnt, shot up 
or torn down. It was sickening to see what devastation the Iraqis had done." 
</P>
<P>
Cheers went up as the plane carrying them to freedom left Baghdad -- but there 
was yet one more moment of fear the newly released hostages would have to 
endure. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the plane was about to touch down in Frankfurt early Monday, the Iraqi 
pilot jerked back the throttle and nosed the plane back into the sky. "We all 
thought the same thing, that we were going back to Baghdad, and we immediately 
began to make plans to hijack the plane," Hughes recalled. "And we weren't 
kidding. We were really going to overpower the crew, and I was going to land 
the plane." 
</P>
<P>
But just as the passengers were about to make their move, it became clear that 
the pilot was circling to make another landing because he had botched his first 
approach.

BUSH TO URGE SETTING LIMITS ON CONGRESS TERMS 
</P>

<P>
President Bush will use his State of the Union address next month to call for 
limits on the number of terms that members of Congress may serve, White House 
Chief of Staff John H. Sununu said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The call will be part of what Sununu, in a speech to the National Press Club 
here, predicted would be a "contentious" period between Bush and congressional 
Democrats over the next year as the President prepares for his expected 
campaign for reelection in 1992. Bush, who has served in federal office most of 
his adult life, supported term limitation measures during the fall campaign 
season, a move that many White House aides predicted would be a prelude to 
emphasizing the issue on the federal level. 
</P>
<P>
While Bush has often emphasized bipartisanship during the first two years of 
his tenure, "I suspect that the second half of this term will be operated a 
little bit differently," Sununu said, noting that "the years before a 
presidential election always seem to be a bit more contentious." 
</P>
<P>
Sununu did not say what kind of term limitation Bush would seek, but 
Republicans generally have argued for a 12-year limit, the equivalent of two 
terms in the Senate or six terms in the House. 
</P>
<P>
It would take a constitutional amendment to change the current system. 
Democrats, who control both the House and Senate, are expected to resist the 
proposal. Democrats control the Senate in the incoming Congress by a margin of 
56 to 44 and the House by a margin of 267 to 167 with one socialist member. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's attempts to cooperate with congressional Democrats have often alienated 
congressional Republicans, particularly in the House, who have felt left out of 
the bargaining. Efforts to limit congressional terms have been an attractive 
theme for Republican House members, who see the move as a way of trying to 
focus public anger against politicians on the Democrats' long-standing majority 
in the House. 
</P>
<P>
In another move likely to be rejected by Democrats but welcomed by House 
Republicans, Sununu said that Bush also would use his State of the Union speech 
-- slated for Jan. 29 -- to propose again a cut in capital gains taxes. 
Democratic leaders rejected that idea during this past year's budget debates, 
arguing that most of the benefits of the cut would go to the most wealthy 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu also defended himself against charges that his frequent bouts of bad 
temper have hurt White House relations with members of both parties on Capitol 
Hill. "I merely put myself down as a political counterpuncher," Sununu said. 
"Any strong statements on my part are both controlled, deliberate and designed 
to achieve an effect. There is no random outburst."

O.C. SUPERVISORS GIVE OK TO HIRING FREEZE; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: THE BOARD ENDED FUNDING FOR YOUTH SHELTERS AND DUCKED TWO PROPOSALS TO 
BRING IN MORE MONEY. 
</P>

<P>
Faced with a worsening budget crunch, the Orange County Board of Supervisors 
approved a hiring freeze and ended funding for several youth shelters Tuesday, 
but the members ducked two politically volatile proposals intended to add more 
than $2.5 million to the county coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Meeting before a packed audience -- veterans, local mayors and uniformed police 
chiefs all spilled into the board room aisles -- the supervisors took pains to 
emphasize that this year's budget has bad news for just about everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"You know that the buck is supposed to stop up here, and I don't know how to 
stop this flow of reductions," an exasperated Supervisor Don R. Roth said. "I'm 
not sleeping well." 
</P>
<P>
The budget woes, which could mean cutbacks in a variety of services, reflect a 
deepening crisis facing many counties across the state. A national economic 
slowdown has cut into traditional sources of revenue such as property taxes and 
building and license fees. And the state government's massive deficit has meant 
that it is cutting back on support for counties. 
</P>
<P>
Of Orange County's budget of about $3.4 billion, most is locked into programs, 
leaving only about $50 million over which the county has real control. 
</P>
<P>
"The unfortunate result of all this is that we are projecting a deficit of 
anywhere as high as $13 million," County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider 
said in his report to the supervisors. "The county's contingency fund is 
currently at $14 million, and, of course, we are not recommending utilization 
of any of the contingency funds. We just cannot afford to deplete the county's 
emergency reserve." 
</P>
<P>
In their effort to prevent that, board members approved a hiring and 
construction freeze that will block virtually all new projects paid for out of 
the county's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
Programs that serve troubled youths lost their funding Tuesday, and a slew of 
more modest cutbacks also were approved, ranging from ambitious efforts to 
curtail overtime to miniscule items such as using less ammunition at the 
Sheriff's Department target range. The latter proposal is expected to save 
$36,000. 
</P>
<P>
But the board tentatively rejected plans to begin next month charging cities 
and school districts a controversial fee for booking their prisoners into jail, 
and it temporarily spared an agency reorganization that could have axed the 
popular Commission on the Status of Women. 
</P>
<P>
The freeze was among the most widely discussed issues during the past week, and 
Ronald S. Rubino, the county's chief budget officer, described it Tuesday as a 
"very drastic measure . . . not favored by a majority of county departments." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the magnitude of the budget problems, however, Rubino and other 
officials recommended the freeze, and the board agreed. It will last at least 
until March, and after that layoffs may be needed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The most immediate effects will be felt by six community programs that 
altogether lost $304,000 -- half their annual budgets, with the other half 
already spent. These include five groups that offer shelter and counseling to 
troubled youngsters. Program officials say they will have to cut back in order 
to absorb the cuts, and dozens of teen-agers could be turned away after Jan. 7, 
when the cuts take effect. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart goes out to the Board of Supervisors that had to make this 
unfortunate decision, but my heart also goes out to the kids who come to us at 
2 and 3 in the morning," Luciann Maulhardt, executive director of the Casa 
Youth Shelter in Los Alamitos, said after the meeting. "Where are they going to 
go now?" 
</P>
<P>
Roth made the same point to his colleagues, and yet said the huge shortfalls in 
county funding make painful cuts necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Roth, who has for months made tackling the budget a central tenet of his 
chairmanship, exhorted other board members to face up to the deficit and join 
him in making the tough decisions. Deferring cuts now will only make the bite 
harder next summer, when the county takes up its 1991-92 budget, Roth argued. 
</P>
<P>
But, with dozens of opponents looking on, the board resisted a pair of 
recommendations that budget officials had predicted could boost the county's 
finances by at least $2.5 million -- and as much as about $4.5 million -- this 
fiscal year, which ends June 30. 
</P>
<P>
Board members rejected a proposal to disband the Community Services Agency -- 
which could include abolishing the Commission on the Status of Women and 
relocating veterans' and seniors' groups under a new agency. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the board sent that proposal, which only was expected to save a few 
hundred thousand dollars, back for more study. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, who once worked as a professor of management, said 
he found the study of the agency incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Disbanding the Community Services Agency "may very well be a necessity," 
Stanton said, but he added that "I personally cannot do so on the basis of 
studies of this nature." 
</P>
<P>
Nina Hull, who chairs the Commission on the Status of Women, cautiously 
welcomed the board's action, but noted that the matter will return to the board 
in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still in limbo," she said. "We'll just have three more months to work on 
getting our view across and hopefully more time to rally support from other 
women's groups throughout the county." 
</P>
<P>
Formed 15 years ago, the commission studies and advises county officials on a 
wide range of issues, including domestic violence, employment discrimination 
and child day-care services. It also acts as a clearinghouse, advising women on 
where and how to get economic, legal and social services. 
</P>
<P>
The board also ducked when it came to a proposal to charge cities and school 
district security forces $154 for every inmate they book into the County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
If imposed in January, that fee could raise more than $8 million a year, but 
the money would come mostly from cities, which would see their budgets suffer. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors directed the staff to prepare a recommendation that would delay 
implemention of the fee until July 1, rather than Jan. 1, as had previously 
been recommended. A public hearing will be held Jan. 9 to debate that question 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have preferred to go ahead and make the decision on the jail booking 
fees today," Supervisor Thomas F. Riley said after the session, which ran for 
nearly three hours. "My reading of what was happening is that Don Roth and I 
were pretty much agreed, but the others had some different things going on." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Harriett M. Wieder and Stanton, responding to complaints from 
cities, raised doubts about the jail booking fee. In its budget sessions last 
summer, the state approved levying of the jail-booking fee so that counties 
could recoup some of the money that they lost from state budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Although Wieder and Stanton said they believe such a fee is needed, both 
questioned whether it should go into effect next month, as budget officers have 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to buy time," Wieder said. "We got dumped on by the state. I 
don't want to dump on the cities." 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of city officials, including many of the county's police chiefs, 
attended Tuesday's session, and several spoke in favor of delaying and reducing 
the proposed fee. Imposing it now, they said, could force cities into drastic 
action to cut their mid-year budgets. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the city leaders urged county officials to defer the fee and join them 
in protesting state budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to work together," Irvine Mayor Sally Anne Sheridan told the board. 
"We recognize how quickly your budget problems can become our budget problems." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors agreed to recommend that the fee not be imposed until July. But 
several warned the city officials that there would be no further compromise. 
"You've got six months to start planning your budgets," Stanton said later. 
"Then that's it." 
</P>
<P>
The board will take a final vote on the fee at the Jan. 9 public hearing.

With 600 members and an observatory near Mt. Palomar, the club has provided the

ANAHEIM-LAS VEGAS HIGH-SPEED TRAIN LINE FACES DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The proposed Anaheim-Las Vegas high-speed magnetic levitation train line will 
be subject to delays that will put off its completion at least two more years, 
to 1999, it was revealed here this week. 
</P>
<P>
But that was not all the unsettling news delivered at a meeting of the 
California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission. 
</P>
<P>
As representatives of Bechtel Corp., which was designated in August as the 
franchisee to build the project, addressed the commission, it became clear that 
many of the line's specifications -- including routes, stops and ridership -- 
are far from complete. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel's project manager, Tom A. Marlow II, also revealed that German 
certification of the maglev technology to be used will not occur until April or 
May. It had been expected last September. 
</P>
<P>
Marlow said that German transportation firms involved in testing the maglev 
train developed by the Trans-Rapid International scientific group have been 
distracted by German reunification and by ambitious plans for a $58-billion 
modernization of the railroads in the former East Germany. Consequently, they 
have put off meetings with Bechtel until early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Magnetic levitation uses electromagnetic force to lift trains above a fixed 
guideway and propel them at speeds up to 300 m.p.h. The technology has been 
slow in coming on line, and there are suggestions that the force levels may 
raise health concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Although Marlow and other Bechtel officials emphasized their company's 
dedication to the Anaheim-Las Vegas project, they said that, in addition to the 
technology, many key operational details will not be settled until the end of 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
Marlow said that the final route of the proposed line has not been determined. 
While the train will stop in Anaheim, it may continue to other Southern 
California points to connect with other transportation systems or to attract 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
He said the same is true with the site of the Las Vegas terminus. Clark County 
supervisors have sought to locate the train station in Las Vegas near McCarran 
International Airport, off the Strip. But Marlow said it may be better to 
terminate the route at a downtown station. 
</P>
<P>
Marlow explained that Bechtel is also closely watching plans for a commuter 
rail network in five Southern California urban counties. Officials hope to 
begin operating it by the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"Inter-modal links for our trains are very important," said Marlow. "They will 
impact our business substantially. We've got to find some investors, and they 
will want to know, first of all, that the riders will be there." 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel plans to commission an independent ridership study that will examine 
alternative routes and show would-be investors that the project is financially 
feasible. That should begin next spring, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the outset of Monday's meetings, Marlow alarmed commissioners by telling 
them that Bechtel did not wish to enter into a final franchise agreement until 
after the completion of all feasibility studies, about two years away. 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, he yielded to commission objections to the delay, saying 
Bechtel would propose the terms of such an agreement, setting forth its 
obligations, by the commission's next meeting, Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Several commissioners expressed concern that so many details of the project 
remain up in the air. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still selling the sizzle of this project, but we don't know what the 
steak is," said former Ontario Mayor Howard J. Snider. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the route," he explained. "It has not been identified precisely. 
We're talking about new time frames. When people ask us where we're going, what 
are we going to say?" 
</P>
<P>
Another commissioner, Rolfe G. Arnhym, executive vice president of the Palm 
Springs Chamber of Commerce, said he was concerned at the message coming out of 
the meeting, which he characterized as one of uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel's manager of corporate communications, Rick Laubscher, responded that 
his company feels that when anyone questions the progress of the project, "Our 
answer is going to be, 'Yes, we're moving forward.' " 
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman Don Roth, an Orange County supervisor who has long been an 
optimist about the project, said the delays "put our commission in somewhat of 
a precarious position." 
</P>
<P>
Roth said the commission may have to seek further public funds to keep itself 
going, or perhaps solicit private grants from foundations or businesses other 
than Bechtel.

The investigation of the controversial shooting of a Mexican youth by a Border 
Patrol agent took an unusual twist Tuesday when Calexico police arrested two 
Mexican consular officials who allegedly attempted to bribe a police employee 
to learn the identity of the agent involved. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from the Imperial County city made the arrests at a restaurant in 
nearby El Centro at 2:20 p.m. Tuesday after authorities arranged a sting in 
response to a bribe offer of $500 to $600, Calexico Police Chief Leslie Ginn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men in custody -- both employees of the Mexican consul's office here -- 
were booked on suspicion of bribery, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if this were Joe Blow off the street, he'd have gone to jail for bribery 
too," Ginn said.

The shooting victim, Eduardo Garcia Zamores, 15, was wounded in the torso Nov. 
18 as he straddled the fence on the border between Calexico and Mexicali, the 
state capital of Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
The agent contends he fired because the youth was about to throw a rock at him. 
</P>
<P>
Zamores says the shooting was unprovoked and several witnesses have backed up 
his story. 
</P>
<P>
The case has resulted in huge protests as well as charges and countercharges by 
investigators of each country against their counterparts. The youth has filed a 
$9-million negligence claim against the Border Patrol. The bribery allegation 
seems likely to escalate the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Ginn said a Calexico-based female Mexican consular official approached a female 
police employee Monday and offered $500 to $600 for the agent's name. Mexican 
officials want to extradite the agent, but have been unable to obtain his name 
from U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The police employee notified her superiors, Ginn said, and a decision was made 
to go ahead with a "meet" as part of a criminal bribery investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The two Mexican officials met Tuesday with the police employee at a Denny's 
restaurant in El Centro, while police had the scene under surveillance, Ginn 
said. The two consular officials allegedly handed over the cash and the police 
worker gave them a piece of paper on which was written a name -- not that of 
the Border Patrol agent -- then police moved in, Ginn said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were arrested on the spot, brought down and booked into our city jail," 
said Ginn, who has headed the small department for 5 1/2 years after a 29-year 
career as a San Diego police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were Ascension Martinez Pena, 46, the consulate's chancellor, or 
administrator, and Karla Elena Correa Ibarra, 27, a secretary, who allegedly 
made the initial contact with the police employee, Ginn said. Both were 
released on $5,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
The police chief said he believed neither of the two has diplomatic immunity, 
which is accorded to many representatives of foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
Marco E. Lopez, the San Diego attorney who is representing them, said he 
believed both were shielded from arrest by diplomatic protection. 
</P>
<P>
"The big shots in Washington are going to have to explain that to me," Ginn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Enrique Loaeza, the Mexican consul general in San Diego, declined to comment on 
specifics of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez contended that his clients were "entrapped" and that Calexico police were 
motivated by vindictiveness toward Mexican officials. 
</P>
<P>
Ginn denied the allegations. The police chief has charged publicly that his 
investigation of the shooting is "at a standstill" because Mexican authorities 
have refused to provide him access to the victim and have impeded his inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials contend that they have cooperated with police.

RECOVERING FROM CHILD ABUSE; 
</P>
<P>
PSYCHOLOGY: RESEARCHERS FIND THAT VICTIMS DO HEAL, BUT HELP FROM FAMILIES AND 
COMMUNITY AGENCIES DETERMINES HOW QUICKLY. MCMARTIN IS AMONG THE PRESCHOOLS 
EXAMINED.

<P>
A five-year study of sexual abuse in preschools, released today by UCLA, has 
concluded that, with the right kind of help, most children who say they have 
been molested eventually recover from the resulting fear, anxiety and behavior 
problems, even though recovery may take months or years. 
</P>
<P>
Funded by the federal government's National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, 
the UCLA study gives researchers the most detailed look yet at the extended 
effects of child abuse. Previous studies generally lasted no longer than a year 
or so, said David Finkelhor, co-director of the Family Research Laboratory at 
the University of New Hampshire and one of the country's leading experts on 
child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it also documents "very clearly the kinds of active support and care 
families and communities must provide" in the aftermath of reports of child 
abuse, Finkelhor said. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the report concluded, children who experienced fewer behavioral and 
emotional problems were those whose mothers were supportive and spent 
significant time with them, and whose families were close and actively sought 
professional and community help. Those children who had the most problems were 
from families who tried to avoid talking about and dealing with the situation. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA study evaluated the behavior and experiences of 82 children from 
preschools in Manhattan Beach and 15 in Reno, Nev., where there had been 
reports of sexual abuse in the spring and fall of 1983. The children who said 
they had been abused were compared to a control group of 37 children from two 
Southern California preschools where no problems of sexual abuse had been 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
At the time they reported abuse, the children in the Manhattan Beach schools 
were between 2 and 6 and those in the Reno preschools were between 3 and 7. 
</P>
<P>
The encouraging news of the study is that "the vast number of these youngsters 
(about two-thirds) do seem to be healed and able to get on with their lives," 
said Jill Waterman, a UCLA psychologist and one of the principal investigators 
in the study. 
</P>
<P>
That does not mean there will not be scars. Nor does it mean that all children 
who said they were sexually abused fared equally well. 
</P>
<P>
More than 83% of the Manhattan Beach children as compared to fewer than 36% of 
the Reno children were reported by their therapists to be suffering 
post-traumatic stress disorder -- a fear of death and torture normally 
associated with war veterans. Most of the Reno children seemed to recover 
relatively quickly, while the study found that 17% of the children from 
Manhattan Beach schools still suffered from serious problems five years after 
the disclosures of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
One explanation of the difference between the two cities, the researchers said, 
may have to do with the kinds of abuse the children reported. Those in Reno 
said they were sexually molested, while those in Manhattan Beach told of 
terrorizing acts of animal torture, Satanic rituals and death threats, in 
addition to sexual molestation. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibly significant difference between the two groups, the researchers 
speculated, had to do with community and legal reaction to the children's 
disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
In Reno, there was a single perpetrator who, having admitted to more sexual 
molestation than children reported, was immediatedly sentenced to four life 
terms in prison. 
</P>
<P>
In Manhattan Beach, the children complained of multiple perpetrators. In a case 
arising from one of the preschools in the study, one jury acquitted suspect Ray 
Buckey, who taught at the McMartin Pre-School, on 40 counts of molestation, and 
a jury in a second trial became hopelessly deadlocked on eight other counts. 
While many jury members said afterward that they were convinced the children 
were telling the truth, they were not certain who was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Waterman said it is not the job of researchers in this or any other study to 
determine guilt or innocence. What scientists must look at is data, and in this 
study the children -- what they said and how they behaved -- was the data to be 
studied. 
</P>
<P>
Although the researchers acknowledge they had no way of proving what actually 
happened, they said there were many indications to suggest the children were 
telling the truth. In a general population of children, Waterman noted, only 
about 2.5% would be expected to have psychological problems, whereas 17% of the 
Manhattan Beach children had lingering problems. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the problems exhibited by the children both in Manhattan Beach and 
Reno were ones often associated with sexual abuse -- outbursts of anger, 
problems sleeping, difficulties concentrating, recurrent nightmares, withdrawal 
-- rather than disorders in thinking or psychotic illusions, which are often 
seen in patients who make up stories and tell lies. 
</P>
<P>
Because all the children in the UCLA study participated in some form of 
psychotherapy following their disclosures, there was no way of knowing what 
might have happened had they not been treated. And while different methods of 
psychotherapy were used by different counselors, there was no one method that 
seemed to work better than others, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
What did seem to make a difference was how the families reacted to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"The families that said, 'We'll overcome this' and took steps to do so did 
better," Waterman observed. "Families that coped by using passive measures -- 
such as watching television or feeling that problems will go away by themselves 
-- did worse, as did families in which the parents were less supportive of 
their children. If the family members can focus on supporting each other and 
weathering this crisis together, the outcome will be more positive." 
</P>
<P>
In general, the children who experienced the fewest behavior problems and the 
least emotional stress were the ones who had families who were the closest, who 
fought the least and who were most willing to turn to community and 
professional resources for help. Those with the speediest and fullest 
recoveries also tended to have mothers whom they perceived as spending more 
time with them and providing them with greater comfort and praise. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the researchers found, mothers and fathers tended to have different 
coping styles in dealing with the situation, and what both do are equally 
important. 
</P>
<P>
In the initial aftermath of reports that their children had been abused, 
mothers immediately became more affectionate toward their children, while 
fathers tended to be significantly less comfortable showing physical affection, 
in some cases for as long as a year afterward. Both parents tended to be more 
lenient with their children, although with time mothers gradually returned to 
their old styles of discipline. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, fathers tended to minimize the abuse and to seek whatever help they 
got from their wives, whereas their wives tended to go outside the home for 
help, often seeking aid and solace from friends. These findings, Waterman said, 
coincide with the differences that are often observed between women, who tend 
to be more vocal about their feelings, and men, who tend to be more reserved. 
</P>
<P>
Fathers who were able to reach out and become actively involved seemed to have 
a very positive impact on their children's recovery, the researchers observed. 
That was not always the case with mothers, however. Those mothers who became 
too involved in outside activities, especially in public education about sexual 
abuse, had children who tended to recover less quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, the researchers theorized, those children felt abandoned by their 
mothers. It is also possible that the mothers who spoke out most publicly 
against child abuse were ones whose children were most traumatized and 
therefore likely to have the longest and most painful recovery period. 
</P>
<P>
For almost all the families, there was increased stress between parent and 
child, as well as greater stress between parents in the early weeks and months 
after reports of sexual abuse. Yet, during the study only a handful of 
marriages broke up in Manhattan Beach and none of the marriages dissolved in 
Reno, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
"Marriages that survived -- and the vast majority did -- were substantially 
stronger and families felt the crisis had brought them closer together," she 
said. "This increased closeness after going through a trauma together appears 
to be an unexpected 'silver lining.' " 
</P>
<P>
In conducting the study, the researchers administered psychological tests and 
questionnaires and conducted detailed face-to-face interviews, not only with 
the children but also with their parents and counselors. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to keep the names of the families confidential and in hopes of not 
having their data subpoenaed by the courts, the researchers did not identify in 
the study which of several preschools the students attended. However, Waterman 
acknowledged in an interview that McMartin was one. In the wake of accusations, 
several preschools in Manhattan Beach and Reno shut down, including McMartin. 
</P>
<P>
Details of what has happened to the children and their families will be 
published first in a scholarly journal and then appear in a book sometime next 
year. In addition to Waterman, the study was conducted by Robert Kelly, 
assistant clinical professor of psychology at UCLA; Jane McCord, an adjunct 
assistant clinical professor at Harbor-UCLA's department of psychiatry, and 
Mary Kay Oliveri, director of the department's Community Response Programs.

NAVY WILL FIX FENCE ON U.S.-MEXICO LINE; 
</P>
<P>
BORDER: THE WORK IS AIMED AT DRUG TRAFFICKING, WITH SLOWING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION 
AS A SECOND GOAL. THE EXISTING BARRIER HAS MANY OPENINGS.

<P>
The U.S.-Mexico border fence -- sagging, full of holes and missing altogether 
in some spots -- is due for a face lift, courtesy of U.S. Navy Seabees. 
</P>
<P>
Construction units based at the Naval Amphibious Base, Coronado, will be 
deployed soon along the border in San Diego, authorities said. Their mission: 
To shore up the fence crossed daily by hundreds of undocumented immigrants 
heading north. 
</P>
<P>
They will join California National Guard units that are improving border-area 
roads to assist enforcement by U.S. border guards. 
</P>
<P>
Both military efforts are aimed primarily at reducing drug smuggling, but U.S. 
immigration authorities say the bolstered fence and improved roadways also will 
deter undocumented border crossers. 
</P>
<P>
The existing fence poses little barrier to smugglers and immigrants. A 
chain-link fence stretches about seven miles east from the Pacific Ocean. Some 
sections have been ripped out or pounded to the ground. A raised braided cable 
-- designed as a barrier to vehicular traffic -- marks much of an additional 
eight miles of border, but the cable is in disrepair and there are numerous 
gaps. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrant-rights advocates have questioned whether a so-called "Tortilla 
Curtain," fixed or not, will turn back people fleeing poverty and war. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy presence is the Pentagon's latest foray into the nation's anti-drug 
offensive. U.S. armed forces are increasingly providing support to civilian law 
enforcement, a trend that has broad support in Congress but has troubled many 
civil libertarians. 
</P>
<P>
The Seabees, according to congressional officials, will place heavy-duty metal 
panels -- designed for use as mats on provisional aircraft landing fields -- as 
reinforcement along the existing barrier. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Border Patrol, which maintains the barrier, has been using the surplus 
landing-pad material for more than a year in the San Diego area. Authorities 
say it has met with some success: No one has cut through it, although many have 
climbed over it and some have dug under. 
</P>
<P>
"They certainly haven't been driving through it," said Ted Swofford, Border 
Patrol supervisory agent in San Diego, the busiest zone along the almost 
2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
So-called "drive throughs" long have been a problem in the border zone, 
particularly in the flat grasslands of the Otay Mesa area. A U.S. plan to dig a 
ditch in that area was withdrawn last year after critics likened it to a new 
Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
The Seabee unit -- known officially as Amphibious Construction Battalion 1 -- 
likely will be deployed within the week, possibly by Friday, said U.S. Rep. 
Duncan L. Hunter (R-Coronado), who has pushed for greater use of the military 
in anti-drug border efforts. His district includes the entire 150-mile boundary 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"The fence along the border is in rags," Hunter said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The Seabee unit and the Border Patrol will determine whether the troops will be 
armed, said Col. James Sutherland, a spokesman for Joint Task Force 6, the El 
Paso-based Pentagon arm that coordinates military involvement in anti-drug 
efforts along the southwest border.

THE ARSONIST: A SHADOWY FIGURE HARD TO CATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The flames were still raging through dense brush in Carbon Canyon Regional Park 
late last month when investigators discovered the remains of an incendiary 
device near a horse trail where the blaze began. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which lasted until the next morning, "was deliberately set by an 
individual who wanted to start a fire," said Orange County Fire Department 
Capt. Dan Young. "Why, we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
About 80 acres of grassland were charred in the fire, which narrowly missed a 
grove of California redwoods and came within a quarter-mile of two housing 
tracts, as well as threatening a mobile home park. It became the 572nd to be 
attributed to arson in Orange County this year. 
</P>
<P>
One in four fires is intentionally set, officials say, and arson is the leading 
cause of fires in commercial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the number of arson fires has declined 8%. But fire officials 
say that the amount of damage has increased by 15%. 
</P>
<P>
And the trend may worsen. Traditionally, a flagging economy is associated with 
an increase in arson-for-profit crimes, as some are tempted to see arson as a 
solution to financial woes. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen the trend yet" this year, said chief arson investigator Mike 
McCann, "but we have seen it in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 500 fires intentionally set this year, only 71 have been 
solved. In many of the unsolved cases, investigators have identified suspects, 
but they lack one or two key pieces of evidence that can lead to an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulties in arson investigations frustrate officials, who say the crime 
not only endangers lives, but raises already high insurance rates and saddles 
financially strapped Orange County with hundreds of thousands of dollars each 
year in firefighting costs. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like you have a dead body with a knife in the back and you can point 
to motive and opportunity," McCann said. "In arson, you have ashes to work 
with." 
</P>
<P>
Arsonists range from homeowners and business people in debt to pyromaniacs and 
burglars trying to hide their tracks. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't always have the smoking gun" in arson crime, McCann said. "Arsonists 
are a cowardly lot. They hide in back alleys and commit their crime in the 
dark." 
</P>
<P>
So difficult is the investigator's task that often, only the public can help 
solve the crime. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, (compiling meaningful evidence) is like searching for a needle in a 
haystack. You have to sift through tons of debris," said Russell Jones, one of 
the County Fire Department's eight full-time arson investigators, whose 
responsibilities include determining cause, doing detective work, making 
arrests and testifying in court as expert witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Some examples of recent cases: 
</P>
<P>
* The Cook Book, a popular Tustin restaurant, burned in May, causing $1 million 
in damage. A nearby store owner locking up for the night reported seeing a 
bright flash before the flames broke out, said arson investigator John 
McMasters. That was the first indication that arson was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Combing through the soggy piles of charred debris and ashes, investigators 
found other, more solid evidence that the fire had been intentionally set. It 
was also apparent that the fire had started in several different spots, a 
strong indicator of arson. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever was in there (at the time of the fire) was intent on destroying the 
building," McMasters said, adding that his unit received an anonymous call 
about the case. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that call, fire officials still do not have enough information to make 
an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, we want to talk to those folks who already called us," McMasters 
said. "We'd like them to come forward to testify." 
</P>
<P>
* In 1989, customers in Little John's Inn in Santa Ana Heights had to dash 
through flames that had engulfed the main entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators discovered that gasoline had been poured on a motorcycle 
belonging to a customer. The cycle was moved against the front door and 
ignited. 
</P>
<P>
No one was seriously injured in that blaze, which caused $200,000 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
The motive, investigators believe, was revenge. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators are not only hampered by a vague description of the arsonist, but 
they are not sure if the suspect was targeting the bar owner, the motorcycle 
owner or someone else in the bar, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know who he was mad at," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Revenge-seeking arsonists may range from a gang member who torches a rival's 
car to a spurned lover who sets a fire to the possessions of an estranged mate, 
or in one recent case, a former lover. 
</P>
<P>
* For the past two months, downtown Tustin area has been plagued by a string of 
dumpster fires that fire officials believe were intentionally set by the same 
person. The fires cause minimal damage, but fire officials are worried that the 
fires will become increasingly more dangerous if the arsonist is not caught 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
One indication was a recent fire which destroyed a late-model Oldsmobile 
convertible parked at a high school football game. Fire officials declined to 
be specific, but they believe that fire was related to the dumpster blazes. 
</P>
<P>
The Tustin fires may be an example of the most perplexing type of arson: that 
set by a "firebugs" who either get sexual or other gratification by watching 
fire or enjoy acting like a "hero" by setting a small fire and reporting it, 
McCann said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials have asked for the public's help in solving the Tustin fires, 
and are hoping for the sort of assistance which landed Peter Diaz Reyes in jail 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes, a 29-year-old transient, has been charged with setting the June 27 fire, 
also in Carbon Canyon, after receiving a tip from a witness who told them that 
they saw the homeless man in the area just before the fire erupted. 
</P>
<P>
After the Nov. 28 fire in the same canyon, police and fire investigators have 
fielded many calls from witnesses who have provided evidence that may lead to 
an arrest. 
</P>
<P>

INDUSTRIAL AREA ZONE CHANGES OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved a new zoning ordinance that includes a ban on 
churches, dance studios, fraternal organizations and martial arts schools in 
industrial areas. The new ordinance also places restrictions on child care 
centers in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, passed unanimously this week, was designed to make sure that 
neighboring businesses remain compatible and that industrial areas remain safe, 
City Manager Robert C. Dunek said. Seven businesses or organizations now in 
operation will be affected by the new ordinance, and all will be allowed to 
retain their sites, city officials said. But some business owners said the 
ordinance will still have an impact. 
</P>
<P>
Dale and Sharon Williamson, the owners of the Kidnastics gymnastics instruction 
studio, believe they will lose negotiating power when their lease comes up for 
renewal. They also predicted that the remaining businesses and organizations 
would eventually dwindle to just one or two because they won't be able to 
afford the higher rents outside industrial areas. 
</P>
<P>
"The seven of us will not be around forever," Sharon Williamson said. " . . . I 
feel that we have to look at these businesses as valuable parts of the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Anthony R. Selvaggi said that allowing special privileges to the 
seven businesses could undermine the new code. "Every time we make a change in 
our zoning code, some business is affected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council asked staff members to try to come up with ways to assist the 
businesses and organizations when they renegotiate their leases. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also limits child care centers to those housed within an 
industrial business. It also requires that employees of the business be the 
primary users of the child care facility. Under the old code, day care centers 
were allowed as separate facilities to serve any number of businesses in an 
industrial center. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ordinance calls for placing limits on the use of real estate 
signs in public rights of way. Real estate agents will be working with city 
officials to draft the new restrictions, which could include setting limits on 
height and the length of time a sign can be posted. TED JOHNSON

PLANNERS TO WEIGH MOBILE HOME PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Laguna Beach Planning Commission will consider a proposed ordinance tonight 
that would offer a broad protection package for mobile home owners forced to 
move when a park closes. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance would require landowners who wish to convert a mobile park to 
another use to either buy the mobile homes at fair market value or pay to 
relocate homeowners to a comparable coastal park in Laguna Beach. Relocation 
costs would include moving expenses, first and last months' rent at a new park 
and the difference in rent between the two parks for a year, if the second park 
is more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
If ultimately approved by the City Council, the ordinance would be one of the 
most comprehensive mobile home relocation plans in the state, said Kathryn 
Lottes, Planning Department assistant director. 
</P>
<P>
K.P. Rice, president of the homeowners association at the Treasure Island 
mobile home park, said: "Fundamentally, what the relocation ordinance does for 
us is it pays us if they take our homes away." 
</P>
<P>
But an attorney for the owners of Treasure Island, the city's largest such 
park, called the ordinance "absurd" and said it will "almost certainly lead to 
litigation" if approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Charles Black objected to a provision that says the price of a 
mobile home would be based on its value in the current setting. Such a 
provision can significantly boost the value of homes in oceanfront parks. 
</P>
<P>
"The tenants don't own the property; they own the coach," Black said. "By 
virtue of this ordinance, we think the city is attempting to transfer a 
significant portion of the value of the property, which my clients purchased, 
to the tenants." 
</P>
<P>
Treasure Island residents have locked horns for more than a year with the park 
owners, Merrill Lynch Hubbard, an investment unit, and Costa Mesa businessman 
Richard Hall, who plan eventually to redevelop the land. The homeowners say 
they hope someday to buy the property. 
</P>
<P>
The park was purchased in August, 1989, for $43 million. Rice said residents 
estimate that the total value of the homes at the current location would range 
from $25 million to $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also addresses the impact that park closures would have on the 
community's stock of affordable housing. Depending on whether the park is 
converted for residential or other use, the park owner would have to provide 
some "affordable units" on or off the site. 
</P>
<P>
Should the commission endorse the plan tonight, it will most likely be 
presented to the City Council in January, Lottes said. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGEWOOD YOUNGSTERS BRING HOLIDAY CHEER TO ELDERLY

Wearing green hats shaped like Christmas trees and bearing handmade holiday 
cards, 19 boys and girls from a home for abused and abandoned children brought 
their own Christmas party to a group of elderly residents Monday. 
</P>
<P>
During their 90-minute morning visit, the children performed, hugged and 
delivered cards to the 15 residents of Buena Vista Guest Home, most in their 
70s and 80s and some with Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes (the holiday season) great. It takes kids to have Christmas," said 
Audrey Adams, 79, while showing off a handmade Christmas card decorated by a 
girl named Sunnie. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing the children sing "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," 86-year-old 
Helen Lees said: "It's a treasure. It's the best thing we could have had. They 
are just precious." 
</P>
<P>
The 5- to 8-year-olds from the Orangewood Children's Home in Orange have all 
been removed from their parents' care, and most are awaiting placement in 
foster homes. Instructional aide Peggy Evans said the field trip and others 
like it are important for the children. 
</P>
<P>
"They live in a confined existence, (even) with all the love and care. It's 
always good for them to go outside. I think something like this is more 
valuable than a trip to Disneyland or Knott's Berry Farm," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kindergarten teacher Leslie Kephart said it was "kind of like visiting their 
grandparents' house." 
</P>
<P>
Kephardt, wearing a white, long-sleeved shirt, red skirt and small, red, 
tree-ornament earrings, helped lead the children in the "chicken dance," which 
involved flapping their arms like a bird, wiggling and clapping. The children 
waved enthusiastically to the residents, who waved back. 
</P>
<P>
Dort Cooley, who manages the Buena Vista home, said the visit was equally 
important for the elderly residents. 
</P>
<P>
"All that hugging and touching is good. They really respond to that. They 
really respond to the kids when they wouldn't respond to a lot of folks." 
Eighty-two-year-old Mildred Brunworth, who received six handmade cards, said 
the visitors were "more fun than grown-ups. They're priceless." 
</P>
<P>
After punch and cookies, the children sang their last song, "We Wish You a 
Merry Christmas," and then left with gifts of candy. 
</P>
<P>
Carol, 8, said she liked giving the Christmas cards best. Hers read, "I like 
you," and had a drawing of herself. "They said it was pretty." 
</P>
<P>
Patty, 6, said her favorite part of the event was "eating the cookies, and 
(meeting) the old people. They smiled at me and I hugged one." JON NALICK

RECESSION COULD SLOW CITY GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economic shadows cast by the coming recession could darken the outlook even for 
Irvine's traditional growth, city officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
If the expense of running the city government and services continues to grow at 
the current level, Irvine would fall about $15 million short during the next 
two years, City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But by no means is the city in dire straits, Brady said during a budget 
planning workshop for City Council members and department heads. Even though 
the nation seems headed for a recession, taxes, fees and other income that fund 
city services should still grow in Irvine by about 6% annually, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Six percent, though, is the smallest growth in the city's 19-year history, 
Brady said. During the past two recessions, city revenue grew by 8% or more. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest pinch will come in the slower growth of sales taxes, Assistant City 
Manager Bernard Strojny said. A recession could cut the city's sales tax growth 
to 5% or 6% a year, Strojny said. It is Irvine's largest revenue producer, 
bringing in about $25 million -- almost half the city's annual income. 
</P>
<P>
Projections show new construction in Irvine dropping by more than 20% during 
the next two years, which will decrease development fees and eliminate the 
sales and property taxes the new buildings would have brought, Strojny said. 
Hotel use is expected to remain constant in the coming years, freezing the 
city's income from its hotel bed tax, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the gloomy sound of those predictions, Irvine will be "fairly 
healthy compared to other Orange County cities," Strojny said. "But nothing 
compared to our past." 
</P>
<P>
The economic discussion sets the stage for the coming months as Irvine 
officials prepare the city's 1991-1993 two-year budget. The 1991 fiscal year 
begins in July. 
</P>
<P>
The belt-tightening will mean that of about 60 city staff positions now vacant, 
only about 15 of those will be filled in the coming months, Brady said. Many of 
the vacancies that will be left open are in the Community Development 
Department, Brady said. TOM McQUEENEY

CITY MAY ELIMINATE SOME BOARDS, PANELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned that the city may have become top-heavy with commissions and 
committees, council members are considering lightening the load. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-year-old Public Safety Commission, for example, might not survive beyond 
January. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which costs the city an estimated $87,000 a year in staff 
support, is one of about 15 of the city's 67 committees, task forces and boards 
the City Council will consider abolishing to cut red tape and save money. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never even heard of some of these committees," Councilman Bill Vardoulis 
said Monday night while leafing through a 10-page list of advisory boards 
created during the city's 19-year history. 
</P>
<P>
The council met Monday in an informal session and delayed action until the 
subject is scheduled for a meeting. But the consensus was that the city can 
survive just fine even if more than a dozen of the committees don't. 
</P>
<P>
Endangered panels may be the Pelican Hills Road Monitoring Committee, the 
Design Review Committee for AT&amp;SF Railway Grade Separation Projects and the 
Peters Canyon Wash Open Space Spine Monitoring Committee. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the city's 67 assorted advisory boards, Santa Ana, with more 
than twice Irvine's population, gets by with 11 and Anaheim has 13. Irvine's 
advisory committees and commissions cost about $500,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Also facing extinction is Irvine's 2-year-old Citizens Advisory Committee on 
International Affairs, which was created by the previous City Council to offer 
advice on the city's role in global affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Most current council members say Irvine shouldn't try to play roles on the 
global stage; they gave the international affairs committee a cold reception 
last month when it tried to persuade the council to boycott, at official city 
functions, coffee grown in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not real excited about (the committee)," Councilman Barry J. Hammond said. 
It would be fine to have the members meet as private individuals and then offer 
advice to the city, but the city shouldn't be involved with international 
affairs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Bye-bye," Vardoulis said of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the cuts will come as a surprise to the boards themselves. Last 
month, Public Safety Commission members asked themselves whether they were 
serving a purpose. The question now has become an official item on its Thursday 
night agenda. 
</P>
<P>
The commission was created to help formulate the city's emergency preparedness 
plan. But commission members in the past have asked the Police Department for 
specialized reports that have taken a lot of staff time and at one point asked 
for transcripts of commission meetings rather than summary minutes, Police 
Chief Leo E. Peart said. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt they were out of control," Peart said. TOM McQUEENEY

CITY PLANS NEW WATER-USE STRATEGY

<P>
After six months of efforts to encourage voluntary water conservation in 
Anaheim resulted in just a 1% reduction in water use, the city Utility 
Department next month will begin an aggressive new water-saving program with 
possible financial rebates for residents. 
</P>
<P>
The city hopes to cut water waste in the city by 10% in the next two years 
under the plan, saving the city up to $1 million, some of which may be passed 
on to water users. 
</P>
<P>
"People start out with very good intentions, but the little good habits we 
build seem to go out the window when the extreme conditions come along," said 
Ray Merchant, a spokesman for the city utility department. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for residents to install low-flush toilets and high-efficiency 
shower heads, which combined can save at least 30 gallons of water per person 
each day. 
</P>
<P>
Incentives, such as a possible $75 to $100 rebate for installing the 
water-saving toilet, would also be offered to encourage residents' 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
The Utility Department also hopes to encourage businesses to participate by 
using recycled water when possible in commercial and industrial operations, and 
by reducing the amount of water used for landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Two new Utility Department staff members will be hired to administer the 
program, which will be jointly funded by the city, the Metropolitan Water 
District and the county Sanitation District of Orange County, with each entity 
paying $120,000 toward the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting water use could result in savings of up to $1 million in fees from the 
Metropolitan Water District and the county Sanitation District. However, the 
Metropolitan Water District can fine the city up to $550,000 if it fails to cut 
water use by 5%. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is that these programs -- though they will have short-term effects -- 
will be long-term programs," said Merchant. "We're still not talking about 
mandatory conservation. But we're talking about doing what we can now so that 
if it becomes mandatory, it won't be severe." LISA MASCARO

IRVINE TO HELP TURN SWORDS INTO PLOWSHARES

The city of Irvine has been awarded a $71,000 Pentagon grant to develop a model 
program showing ways in which defense contractors can shift their work from 
military to civilian enterprises, it was announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The grant is part of a program conceived a year ago when international tensions 
were easing and the federal government was beginning to make major cuts in 
defense spending. The idea was to look for new uses for military bases being 
closed and to help aerospace firms find work other than building new weapons 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's plan envisions wooing aerospace companies to play a major role in 
ambitious mass transit projects being discussed by the city of Irvine and by 
Orange County. The program is aimed at convincing the aerospace sector and 
other firms linked to defense to shift their expertise to projects such as 
proposed monorail and people-mover systems, said Margo Bowers, who will oversee 
the one-year project. 
</P>
<P>
The program will also establish the Institute for Entrepreneurial Development, 
an advisory group of public and private leaders from banking, academe, industry 
and business that will recommend ways in which defense contractors can 
participate in transit projects. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers, whose salary and expenses will absorb nearly all of the grant money, 
said her goal is to show "how well we can attract ordinarily defense-type firms 
into a public project. A huge percentage of business conducted in the L.A. 
Basin is, in one way or another, military-related. More and more businesses are 
closing and more and more people are out of work." 
</P>
<P>
The grant was the brainchild of former Irvine Mayor Larry Agran, who embraced 
the notion of "economic conversion," the phrase used for shifting America's 
reliance away from defense to civilian enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Agran, who was out of town and unavailable Tuesday for comment, has envisioned 
using the city's $250-million monorail proposal to create a local 
mass-transportation industry using defense companies now undergoing layoffs and 
cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
In its efforts to help communities trying to adapt to changes in military 
spending, the Pentagon's Office of Economic Adjustment issues the grants from a 
$3.5-million fund and provides technical aid.

RABBI CALLS ON U.S. TO STOP 'MENACE' IN MIDDLE EAST AS HANUKKAH BEGINS

The rabbi of one of Orange County's largest temples called on the United States 
to uphold freedom in the Middle East as Jews all over the world Tuesday 
celebrated the first day of Hanukkah. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to about 20 people who had gathered at Temple Beth Emet to celebrate 
the Jewish Festival of Lights, Rabbi Irvin Brandwein said that the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait was unacceptable and that the U.S. military presence in the 
Persian Gulf, as well as its strong alliance with Israel, was necessary to 
pressure Saddam Hussein into withdrawing his forces. 
</P>
<P>
"America must fight to put a stop to this menance that is a threat to the 
world," Brandwein said. 
</P>
<P>
As Cantor Philip Moddel lit the first candle of the menorah, Brandwein also 
called upon Saudi Arabia to allow American servicemen to practice their own 
religions. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sure Americans are suppressing not just their flags but their crosses 
and Stars of David as well," Brandwein said. "Saudi Arabia is a part of the 
world that operates according to a very Medieval religious system " that frowns 
upon religious toleration and violates the basic principle of Hanukkah -- "the 
freedom to worship according to each person's conscience."

OFFICERS PRESS HUNT FOR KIDNAP-SLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Santa Ana police and Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies on Tuesday pressed 
their investigations into the kidnaping of two Santa Ana men who were robbed 
and then driven to Malibu, where one was fatally shot. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities declined Tuesday to release the names of the victims. They said new 
information on the case may be released today. 
</P>
<P>
The abductions occurred about 10:30 p.m. Sunday night when the victims were 
taken from a Santa Ana bar at gunpoint and robbed of their wallets and gold 
jewelry, according to Sgt. Tom Pitkin, watch commander for the Malibu station 
of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
After driving the victims around for more than three hours, the kidnapers took 
them to a point on Decker Road about a quarter-mile north of Pacific Coast 
Highway, made them get out of the car and kneel by the side of the road, Pitkin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the victims was then shot once in the back of the head at close range. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an execution," Pitkin said. "It blew out the back of his head. When the 
survivor saw them execute his friend, he just bailed out and headed down the 
hill." 
</P>
<P>
The survivor, who apparently eluded his captors for about four hours in the 
dense brush, was described as a Salvadoran national between the ages of 25 and 
30. 
</P>
<P>
Decker Road, in the area where he made his escape, is one of the steepest and 
most remote roads in the Malibu area, Pitkin said. 
</P>
<P>
The survivor waited until daylight Monday and then flagged down a passing 
motorist. 
</P>
<P>
Since the shooting, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and investigators 
from the Santa Ana Police Department have uncovered few clues that they will 
discuss publicly but have run onto many unanswered questions. 
</P>
<P>
"This begs the question: If they were just going to rob them, why drive all 
that way?" asked one officer, who asked not to be identified. "And why kill 
them over a robbery? I would suspect they were looking for more than just what 
these (victims) had on them." 
</P>
<P>
Police do not know what type of gun was used, and the only clue left at the 
scene was a pair of surgical gloves, apparently used to prevent fingerprints 
from being left behind, Pitkin said. 
</P>

I-5 MEDIAN FENCE TO SAVE MIGRANTS FROM FREEWAY TRAFFIC CALLED 'WASTE OF MONEY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A proposal to build a fence along the median of Interstate 5 to prevent more 
deaths of immigrants near the San Onofre checkpoint is "a waste of money," 
community leaders told Caltrans officials Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A study by Cal State Fullerton researchers commissioned by Caltrans recently 
concluded that construction of a fence along 8 miles of the freeway just south 
of the Orange County line is the best way to prevent accidents that have 
claimed more than 100 lives in five years on highways between the Mexican 
border and San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say it's a waste of money," said Evelyn Colon Becktell, chairwoman of 
the Orange County Coalition for Immigrant Rights, who attended the Caltrans 
meeting at the Fullerton Public Library. "When they put up more lights (along 
the highway), the immigrants went farther up the highway, where there were no 
lights. The same thing is going to happen with the wall. They're going to go 
farther up along I-5, and one way or another, they're going to get killed." 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans officials are hosting a series of meetings to expand public awareness 
about the immigrant deaths. They told the small gathering that they are working 
with officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the U.S. Border 
Patrol and the California Highway Patrol to find a solution for a problem that 
stems from the tens of thousands of immigrants streaming in from Latin America 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the deaths occur near the Border Patrol checkpoint near San Onofre. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants making their way north by vehicle are often told by their "coyotes," 
or smugglers, to get out of the car and walk several miles north past the 
checkpoint to avoid detection by Border Patrol agents. The hike, often taken in 
the dark of night, involves crossing the north and southbound lanes of 
fast-moving traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"As the smuggling process becomes more sophisticated, we are seeing more 
problems at San Onofre," said Steve Saville of Caltrans' public affairs office. 
</P>
<P>
He and Jim Larson, another Caltrans spokesman, told those at the meeting that 
the wall is only a part of their campaign to prevent more deaths. They also are 
trying to spread the word among immigrants to be careful along the highways. 
</P>
<P>
One Caltrans flyer that has been handed out at hiring halls, community centers 
and churches says: "For the love of God do not cross the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to say what's working, but the word is starting to get out," 
Larson said, noting that there has not been a death for several months near San 
Onofre. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Cal State Fullerton, nearing the end of a yearlong study, polled 
100 policy-makers, academics, immigrant advocates and others who have followed 
the issue. They found that 71% of all respondents stated that a barrier would 
be a "very effective" or "extremely effective" device to prevent the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
But those at the Orange County meeting told Caltrans officials that getting the 
word out about the dangers, rather than erecting a barrier, is a better 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans's Larson said officials are still in the midst of hearing from more 
people before they make a final decision.

TAMPA BAY TOPS ON WALSH'S LIST IF HE LEAVES TELEVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's still unknown whether Bill Walsh will return to the broadcast booth next 
season, but the former San Francisco 49er coach did indicate a preference for 
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers should he return to football. 
</P>
<P>
"If I pick a team to sign with, Tampa Bay would be at the top of my list," 
Walsh told the St. Petersburg Times. "But there's a lot that would have to 
occur before we finalize something." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's name has surfaced as a possible replacement at virtually every 
franchise that is having trouble. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported Tuesday 
that three teams, possibly including the Rams, have already contacted Walsh. 
Cleveland and Tampa Bay were the other teams. 
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper report may be nothing more than speculation based on 
rumor. Neither Walsh nor Rams executive vice president John Shaw could be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh has given no indication to his colleagues that he has an interest with 
the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Enberg, a broadcast partner of Walsh's at NBC, said that Walsh has had a 
lot of contact from teams but Enberg labeled the Ram rumor as "the least 
credible of them all." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Jones, who spent last weekend with Walsh working the Denver-Kansas City 
game, said he talked extensively with Walsh about a possible return to 
football. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what he's going to do, and I don't think Bill knows what he's 
going to do," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Network sources indicate that NBC is satisfied with Walsh's work but given 
current budget constraints haven't decided whether to sign him to another 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh has said that he will not decide his future until after the football 
season. He has not spoken with Buccaneer owner Hugh Culverhouse, but Walsh said 
in the St. Petersburg paper that Culverhouse had asked San Francisco owner 
Eddie DeBartolo to represent Tampa Bay interests in preliminary discussions.

RAM NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
UNLIKE LAST YEAR, OPPONENTS ARE GETTING THE BREAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Were the 1989 Rams as dominant as their 13-6 record indicates? Is the 1990 team 
really a four-and-nine kind of hapless? 
</P>
<P>
The answer, in both cases, is probably "No." 
</P>
<P>
A quick look shows the two teams are statistically similar. In 1989, the Rams 
averaged 119 yards rushing and 258 passing; opponents rushed for an average of 
96 yards and passed for 251. This year, the Rams are averaging fewer yards -- 
106 on the ground and 244 in the air -- but so are opponents (99 and 246). 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, those numbers don't explain the disparity in the won-loss column. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one could argue that the difference is simply a case of good fortunes 
gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
And, unfortunately for him, the football gods apparently have decided that 
Cleveland Gary should be in charge of evening things up after all that Ram luck 
in '89, when opponents suffered from dropsy. 
</P>
<P>
Follow last year's bouncing ball: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Rams beat the Green Bay Packers, 41-38, but were outscored, 31-3, in 
the second half. Packer running back Brent Fullwood lost a fumble going into 
the end zone during the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A week later, the San Francisco 49ers' Tom Rathman fumbled deep in Ram 
territory in the fourth quarter, and the Rams came back to win, 13-12, on a 
last-second field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dallas fullback Darryl Johnson fumbled with less than five minutes to play 
and, two plays later, the Rams had scored their third touchdown that was a 
direct result of a Cowboy fumble. The Rams won, 35-31, when time ran out with 
Dallas on the Ram 13. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams also were lucky to get into the playoffs last season, escaping the New 
England Patriots on Christmas Eve with a 24-20 victory after three Steve Grogan 
passes from the Ram four-yard line fell incomplete in the end zone. In the NFC 
division playoff game against the New York Giants, the Rams rallied to tie the 
score in regulation, won the coin toss, were aided by a questionable 27-yard 
pass interference and won on a Jim Everett pass to Flipper Anderson in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we made most of the key plays," tight end Pete Holohan says. "This 
year, we've been on the short end of the stick." 
</P>
<P>
That pretty much sums it up, and Coach John Robinson says there's no explaining 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just not making the plays," he said. "Whether we're not playing as well 
or not coaching as well or the fortunes of the gods of football are against us, 
those are debatable questions, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're in the situations where we can make the plays, and right now, we're 
not." 
</P>
<P>
And that -- for whatever reason -- has been the most disheartening aspect of a 
season of discontent. Robinson points to four losses -- to the Philadelphia 
Eagles (27-21), Cincinnati Bengals (34-31 in overtime), Dallas (24-21) and the 
New Orleans Saints last Sunday (24-20) -- as the ones that got away. 
</P>
<P>
"Our season, you could look at a lot of things that went wrong, but (those) 
were all there to be won. A year ago, when all those same situations presented 
themselves, we went in and scored and won. A lot of other things have 
transpired this season that have been disappointing, but that certainly has 
been one, just the winning and losing of games." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the media have been tough on Gary. And maybe the fans have been merciless 
(although we haven't seen any "Doctor Drop" signs at Anaheim Stadium yet). But 
Robinson says the second-year running back hasn't exactly been consoled by his 
teammates, either. 
</P>
<P>
"There weren't a lot of guys saying, 'Hang in there, Cleveland, you'll get the 
next one,"' he said. "The word hanging was used, but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
A look at the game films of Sunday's loss and a close inspection of the 
statistics didn't leave Robinson feeling any better. The Rams had more than 
twice as many total yards, nearly three times as many first downs and finally 
throttled an opponent's passing attack. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so one-sided, that's what was so astounding," he said, shaking his 
head. "I might see how Cleveland commits suicide and do it with him." 
</P>
<P>
Add Gary fallout: Robinson indicated that Marcus Dupree, who was activated five 
weeks ago after a five-year absence from the game, might see more playing time 
at tailback. But don't expect to see Dupree, who has six carries for 30 yards 
as a Ram, take over the bulk of the duties. 
</P>
<P>
"We will see Marcus in some capacity," Robinson said. "I feel like he's just 
about ready to play, but there's some limit. Let's don't jump that far ahead. 
Let's just see if we can get him in the game with more than a minute left in 
the game. Let's just take it gradual. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that really has been a problem with Cleveland is the 
fundamental work he's missed in missing two training camps. Here's a guy 
(Dupree) who's never had a training camp and hasn't played the game for five 
years. Let's don't jump those gaps."

TUSTIN'S ANCICH IS COACH OF THE YEAR

Marijon Ancich, who led Tustin High School to its first football championship 
game in 42 years, is The Times' Orange County coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Ancich led Tustin to a 13-1 record in his seventh season, winning the Sea View 
League title and earning the top seeding in the Division VI playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Ancich is the winningest active coach in the Southern Section with a career 
mark of 237-66-9 in 26 seasons. He spent 19 years at St. Paul before moving to 
Tustin in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Ancich immediately revived one of the county's worst programs. The Tillers were 
1-9 in 1983 and 3-17 in the two seasons before Ancich was hired but were 6-4 in 
his first season. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Tustin outscored three playoff opponents, 104-20, to advance to the 
division championship game for the first time since 1948. Sunny Hills upset 
Tustin, 7-3, for the title. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin's season began in Hawaii, where the Tillers spent a week at a remote 
church camp preparing for their opener against Honolulu Pac-5 at Oahu's Aloha 
Stadium. Tustin won, 37-7, and went on to average 26.8 points per game. TOM

Esperanza High School has earned its share of athletic glory since the school 
opened in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
The football program has produced five teams that have qualified for Southern 
Section championship games, including the 1990 Division III title winners. 
</P>
<P>
The baseball program is perennially among the best in Orange County and was 
ranked No. 1 in the nation in 1986 when it won the Division 4-A title. 
</P>
<P>
Championship banners that chronicle Esperanza's athletic success fill the gym, 
a subtle reminder to the players on the basketball team that success has eluded 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking up there the other day, and there's only one (1981) league 
basketball championship banner hanging on those walls," Coach Mark Hill said. 
"We're hoping to add a second one this year. The league (title) is still up for 
grabs in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza and defending champion Los Alamitos are co-favorites to win the 
league title. But Loara, with guard Tes Whitlock, and a vastly improved Katella 
team should not be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
"Tes Whitlock is capable of carrying Loara to the league title," Los Alamitos 
Coach Steve Brooks said. Brooks should know; Whitlock scored 54 points against 
his team last season. 
</P>
<P>
Katella has missed the playoffs the past three years after qualifying for 22 in 
a row, but Katella Coach Tom Danley says this year's team compares with past 
championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Esperanza twice in the Valencia tournament and they look good, but they 
can be beaten," Danley said. "On a given night, anybody can beat anybody else 
in this league." 
</P>
<P>
CYPRESS 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Kevin Loftus (third year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 10-16, 2-8 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Five. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Two. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Adrian Gutierrez (F, 6-3, Sr.); Joe Groover (F, 6-2, Sr.); John 
Lin (G, 5-10, Sr.); Courtney Smalley (F, 6-3, Sr.); Youssef Semaan (G, 5-10, 
Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Lance Brooks (G, 5-10, Jr.); Vince Laguana (G, 5-7, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Last year, guard Jared Rice carried Cypress, averaging 26.2 points per 
game and making 55 three-point shots. This year, Smalley has been a one-man 
show, averaging 24.8 points in five games, including a school-record 45 against 
Huntington Beach. Cypress is starting two juniors -- Brooks and Laguana -- in 
the backcourt, and so far they have been inconsistent. Esperanza used its 
superior height to pound Cypress, 81-48, in the Valencia tournament. Smalley is 
the tallest player on the team at 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
KATELLA 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Tom Danley (25th year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 6-18, 2-8 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Six. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Two. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Roger Arias (F, 6-4, F); Kevin Carlson (F, 6-5, Sr.); Dave 
Jensen (G, 6-2, Sr.); Eric Martinez (G, 6-1, Sr.). Top newcomers: Brian Carlson 
(F, 6-5, Soph.); Vince Encarnacion (G, 5-10, Jr); Bernie Perkins (C, 6-5, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Katella has fallen on hard times the past three seasons, with a 19-47 
record since it won its last league title in 1986-87. "It hasn't been much fun 
the past couple of years," Danley said. The talent pool went dry for three 
years, but Danley is encouraged this season, particularly with the play of the 
Carlson brothers. Kevin is a a two-year starter who high jumped seven feet as a 
junior. He is averaging 23.5 points a game. "We have some size and the ability 
to go seven or eight deep," Danley said. 
</P>
<P>
EL DORADO 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Wayne Carlson (third year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 15-11, 5-5 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Five. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Two. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Mike Johnson (G, 6-2, Jr.); Brian Loyd (G, 6-2, Jr.); Bill 
McAdam (F, 6-4, Sr.); Matt Raya (G, 5-9, Sr.); Brett Tomko (F, 6-4, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Brett D'Arc (C, 6-6, Jr.); Shawn Holcomb (G, 6-3, Jr); Mark 
Selway (G, 5-11, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Carlson is touting Brian Loyd as one of the top juniors in the county. 
Loyd is averaging 15.3 points a game, but Brett Tomko is the team's leading 
scorer with a 17-point average. The Golden Hawks are a young team with five 
juniors among their top eight players, but Carlson says they will contend for 
the title. "Loyd and Johnson are outstanding shooters," Carlson said. "We lack 
height, and we'll be going through a learning process early in the season with 
so many juniors on the team." 
</P>
<P>
ESPERANZA 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Mark Hill (third year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 16-11, 8-2 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Five. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Four. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Brett Evans (G, 5-11, Sr.); Joe Foss (G, 6-4, Sr.); Matt Kordik 
(F, 6-6, Jr.); Matt Thimgan (C, 6-5, Sr.). Top newcomers: Jeff Campau (G, 6-1, 
Soph.); Randy Wilson (F, 6-5, Jr.); Fabien Ziegler (F, 6-4, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Esperanza is the most experienced team in the league with three 
three-year starters -- Evans, Thimgan and Foss. Foss averaged 13 points as a 
sophomore, 21 as a junior and 26 in five games this year. Esperanza has 
out-rebounded every team it has played this season; Thimgan leads the team in 
rebounding with an 11.2 average. The Aztecs are the tallest team in the league 
with six players at 6-4 or taller. In its only loss, Esperanza blew a 
seven-point lead in the final 1:45. Esperanza will travel to Illinois to play 
in the 10,000-seat Metro Center in the 27th Rockford tournament Dec. 26-29. 
</P>
<P>
LOARA 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Ed Prange (first year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 15-7, 4-6 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Three. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Three. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Charlie Gipson (F, 6-1, Sr.); Tes Whitlock (G, 6-1, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Ron Harris (G, 5-10, Jr.); Glen Maggio (G, 5-10, Jr.); Jason 
Vaughn (C, 6-4, Sr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Whitlock was the second-leading scorer in the county last year with a 
29.8 average and had a high game of 54 points against Los Alamitos, the 
third-highest in county history. He has picked up where he left off, averaging 
36 points in four games, including a 30-point outburst in one quarter against 
Pacifica. No one questions Whitlock's ability, but the supporting cast will 
determine the Saxons' season. Charlie Gipson will provide additional scoring 
and Ron Harris is the point guard. Prange has dismissed Dan Wassink, a 
returning starting forward, from the team for disciplinary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Steve Brooks (ninth year). 
</P>
<P>
1989-90 record: 20-7, 9-1 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Returning lettermen: Six. 
</P>
<P>
Returning starters: Two. 
</P>
<P>
Top returnees: Keith Boldon (F, 6-3, Sr.); Jason Cunningham (F, 6-4, Jr.); John 
Daugherty (G, 6-2, Jr.); Geoff Graham (F, 6-5, F); Bryan Hakala (G, 6-1, Sr); 
Eric Schluntz (C, 6-5, Sr). 
</P>
<P>
Top newcomers: Steve Carbone (G, 6-2, Soph.); Brian Kadlac (C, 6-8, Jr.). 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Which Los Alamitos team will show up? The one that beat Mater Dei, 
56-55, or the one that fell behind by 31 points in the second quarter and lost 
to Tustin, 78-56? The key is the play of point guard Bryan Hakala, who 
struggled to nine points against Tustin, scoring only two in the opening three 
quarters. He came back to score 23 points in the upset of Mater Dei. Boldon 
scored 44 points in a 103-100 victory over University but hasn't reached double 
figures since. Cunningham is the team's top athlete and most consistent player, 
averaging 17 points per game.

The bar where Rob Moroso drank beer before his fatal accident on Sept. 30 was 
not to blame for the wreck that killed the rookie NASCAR driver and another 
person, North Carolina's Alcohol Law Enforcement division said. 
</P>
<P>
The division said it found no evidence of irresponsible alcohol service by any 
establishment visited by Moroso. 
</P>
<P>
According to the North Carolina Highway Patrol, Moroso, 22, was driving in 
excess of 75 m.p.h. on a state highway near Mooresville, N.C., when he lost 
control of the car on a curve and slid into the path of an oncoming car. 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Williams, 27, was killed when her car was hit by Moroso's.

Quiksilver Extends Expiration Date: Newport Beach-based Quiksilver Inc. has 
agreed to extend the expiration date of its offer to buy the French company 
that distributes its surfwear in Europe, Na Pali S.A. Quiksilver said it agreed 
to the extension because a pre-closing audit is not yet complete. 
</P>
<P>
Quiksilver Chairman John C. Warner said in a statement Monday that the audit is 
expected to be done next month. The two companies "will proceed as rapidly as 
possible" to complete the sale, Quiksilver said. Na Pali, which reported sales 
of $21 million for its fiscal year ended May 31, agreed to the acquisition in a 
deal announced in October.

Tiny powerhouse: On the banking side, another trade publication recently named 
tiny Colonial Bank in Santa Ana as California's strongest bank. 
</P>
<P>
The Holt Advisory in West Palm Beach, Fla., based its decision on a variety of 
factors, including a formula it developed to determine a bank's soundness. 
Colonial's safety factor was rated A-minus, according to the publication. 
</P>
<P>
Colonial was created in 1987 to purchase the assets of the failed New City Bank 
in Orange. With $68.7 million in assets at the end of June and net income of 
$630,000 for the first nine months, Colonial hopes to expand its business 
banking activities under new management, said Robert P. Zingg, the bank's new 
president and chief executive.

Thrifts score high: When playing with the heavyweights in the S&amp;L industry, 
two Orange County thrifts have matched up quite well, according to an industry 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
Western Financial Savings Bank in Irvine and Downey Savings &amp; Loan in 
Newport Beach placed second and fifth, respectively, in a ranking by United 
States Banker magazine of the performance of the nation's 100 largest thrifts 
for the year ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The thrifts were scored on the basis of their reserves, amount of bad loans, 
capital and return on assets, which is a standard measure of profitability.

FOUNTAIN VALLEY'S BEACH SAVINGS LOSES MORE TOP OFFICIALS 
</P>

<P>
Beach Savings Bank might need to hang out a "Help Wanted" sign on its window 
after the latest round of departures at the small Fountain Valley savings and 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
Ernest F. Thompson, in ill health, quit his positions as president and chief 
executive last week. 
</P>
<P>
And James E. Rott, the chief financial officer, is expected to leave soon for a 
private accounting practice in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the two-branch thrift lost a controller, an assistant 
controller and a branch administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Beach's owner and chairman, Anaheim developer James A. Carter, said he is 
concentrating on hiring a new president and will let that person decide what 
positions to fill. Rott, he said, has agreed to stay on for up to three months 
to help with the transition. 
</P>
<P>
In the current economic slowdown, Carter said, Beach has closed down its 
mortgage lending operation, which employed about a dozen people, and has 
reduced its assets to about $85 million, from $102 million at the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift has lost so many employees that a minimum of only two remain at the 
S&amp;L's Newport Beach branch. Internal controls, if not regulatory rules, 
dictate that an employee from the headquarters office go to the Newport Beach 
office whenever one of the branch employees goes to lunch or is otherwise 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who also owns Corporate Bank in Santa Ana, purchased Beach at the end 
of 1986. Previously, he had a tough time trying to buy a thrift. He tried for 
two years to purchase an S&amp;L in Alhambra before switching to Beach.

FDA APPROVES IRVINE HEART-VALVE FIRM'S ALERT; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: PFIZER'S MECHANICAL DEVICES, WITH POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING 
FRACTURES, HAVE BEEN IMPLANTED IN 82,000 PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD. 
</P>

<P>
The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday announced its formal approval of 
Pfizer Inc.'s national program to alert 19,000 doctors about potentially flawed 
valves for artificial hearts, which are blamed in about 260 deaths. But 
government officials said they still have some concerns about the program. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, it was disclosed that the FDA criticized Pfizer's Shiley 
Inc. unit for failing to include adequate warnings about potentially 
life-threatening fractures in the mechanical valves that have been implanted in 
82,000 people worldwide. Irvine-based Shiley manufactured the valves, which the 
company voluntarily withdrew from the market in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
After several news reports this week drew attention to the FDA's criticism, the 
agency released a statement Tuesday saying it had accepted Shiley's plan to 
find patients implanted with its Bjork-Shiley 60-degree Convexo-Concave valve. 
</P>
<P>
"Those words are not meant to convey (that) we accept or endorse the packaging 
of the materials," said James Morrison, the FDA's deputy director of training 
and assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Shiley had a different interpretation of the FDA's action. "This is almost a 
retraction of the statements yesterday," said Becky Zadro, a Shiley 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA, Shiley and Public Citizen -- a consumer group founded by Ralph Nader 
-- have been working together since September on a plan for contacting 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
"We and the FDA mainly agree on the plan," said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of 
Public Citizen's Health Research Group. "We were snookered, though, about the 
packaging because they didn't show us those envelopes." 
</P>
<P>
The FDA criticized the original packages that Pfizer sent to doctors, saying 
the envelopes resembled junk mail and were likely to be discarded by doctors. 
The envelopes showed a picture of a man and woman talking to a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
About 82,000 people worldwide -- 23,000 of them in North America -- were 
implanted with the valve; 55,000 of them are still living. According to FDA 
figures, 395 of the Shiley valves have fractured, resulting in about 260 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Shiley has contracted with Medic Alert, a nonprofit medical information 
foundation in Turlock in Northern California to build a national computerized 
registry of valve recipients that would be available to doctors and emergency 
medical personnel. There is some evidence that valve fracture victims can be 
saved if the problem is diagnosed in time. 
</P>
<P>
Those people in the registry will receive identification cards and a bracelet 
or necklace -- similar to those worn by diabetics -- saying that they have a 
Bjork-Shiley valve.

FOR MANY COMPANIES, THE PARTY'S OVER; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: WITH THE DOWNTURN AND THE EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, FIRMS ARE CUTTING 
BACK ON THE HOLIDAY CELEBRATIONS. 
</P>

<P>
Call it what you want. A slowdown, a downturn or a slump. Even a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever ails America's economy this holiday season, the toll is dismally 
clear: massive layoffs, faltering firms, tumbling retail sales, predictions of 
even more dire trends. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, for many companies, especially those connected to the economically 
battered construction industry in Orange County and other regions, it is not 
business as usual this holiday seasons, a bleakness compounded by the anxieties 
stemming from the Persian Gulf confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Consider one more spinoff trend of this spreading economic malaise: This 
season's corporate-hosted employee parties are being cut back drastically by 
many major firms. It seems a lot of conspicuous glitz and top-of-the-line 
celebrating are on hold. 
</P>
<P>
Some firms have canceled employee parties, except for a few speeches and 
thank-you's at brief in-office gatherings, according to local party planners 
and caterers. Mostly, though, firms are downscaling the events. These annual 
events, usually held at hotels or in company headquarters, are based on tighter 
budgets than in the past, planners said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of companies are downplaying the scale, being more conservative this 
year. It's basic foods now, not imported seafoods. It's disc jockeys or CD 
players, not live bands," said party planner Hillary Harris of the Newport 
Beach-based catering service, Cuisine/Cuisine Etc. 
</P>
<P>
Added planner Alan Greeley of Golden Truffle Catering in Costa Mesa: "Even if 
these firms can afford putting on (big employee) parties, they're still cutting 
back. They don't want to appear lavish. It's the image factor." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the William Lyon Co. falls into this category. The Newport 
Beach-based company, the nation's leader in new home sales, canceled this 
year's usual hotel dinner-dance for a simpler in-office buffet. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still doing our annual employee donation drive (for the Orangewood 
Children's Home)," explained Lyon Senior Vice President Richard Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
"But when it came to doing a big employee party again, we felt it would not be 
the sensible and appropriate thing to do, not now. Not with the (economic) 
downturn and what's happening with Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
The image of company parties -- as much a holiday institution for Yuletide 
ho-ho-ho as it is for nurturing employee togetherness -- has been changing for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The wilder aspects of the image has been tamed. Party planners maintained that 
the old notoriety of hard drinking and high spirits -- the stereotypical, 
legendary side of the office party -- is no longer prevalent. 
</P>
<P>
Consumption of alcohol at such parties is far more moderate, a reflection, 
planners said, of the anti-drunk-driving campaigns in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
And many such parties have become more familial, folksy and aimed at charitable 
causes. Parties welcoming employees' spouses and children are as common as 
parties tied to charitable food and toy drives. 
</P>
<P>
Subdued or not, the larger corporate employee parties stayed at a conspicuous 
level of lavishness through the mid-1980s, when the economic mood was one of 
prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
It was not unusual for the bigger companies to invite hundreds, or in some 
cases more than a thousand guests, to elaborate festivities at hotel ballrooms, 
country clubs, banquet halls and mansions. Or gathered on grand yachts or under 
vast outdoor tents. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the most dazzling events cost well over a $100,000 apiece, 
according to one longtime party planner, Golden Truffle's Greeley. The most 
sumptuous settings boasted special themes, such as Dickensian or North Pole 
wonderlands. Or Italian gardens, whirling carousels or Caribbean cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest parties last year was a $60,000 spectacle that party planner 
Jan Parrott remembers fondly. 
</P>
<P>
"It had everything -- charm, drama, eye-catching scale," said the Laguna 
Beach-based consultant, whose Particular Parrott service handles a clientele 
mostly of building industry companies. 
</P>
<P>
Using a sprawling vacant office facility and drawing 500 people, the event came 
complete with lighted trees, strolling singers and a rock dance band. The 
buffet tables, overflowing with lamb, pasta and other goodies, were framed by 
tableau-styled tributes to art masterworks of the Orient, Egypt, Italy and 
France. 
</P>
<P>
But the same client -- a builder -- isn't a repeat customer this year, said 
Parrott, whose roster of large-scale parties at hotels and offices is down from 
19 last year to eight this year -- most of the dropouts being 
construction-industry companies. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are pretty grim for a lot of firms out there hit very hard by the 
downturn," Parrott said. "They saw the handwriting on the wall earlier this 
year. They told me they were cutting the (party) budget or simply bowing out 
completely this season." 
</P>
<P>
Although Cuisine/Cuisine Etc.'s Harris said her firm's overall sales are higher 
than in 1989, her corporate party business has dropped from 72 clients last 
year to 50 this year. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons are not difficult to find. 
</P>
<P>
Announcements of layoffs in Southern California industries, from high-tech and 
blue-collar manufacturers to major retailers, have become almost commonplace in 
recent months. This fall, more than 10,000 aerospace workers were let go. 
</P>
<P>
But it is Southern California's growing slump in the housing industry that 
currently seems the most spectacular. In Orange County alone, new home sales 
have plummeted by more than 20%; in home resales, more than 30%. This fall, 
more than 1,000 of the county's construction workers were laid off. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the companies that have deserted the usual hotel-and-club circuit are 
still holding parties, but at their own offices, Harris and other planners 
said. To reduce costs further, some are combining their annual parties for 
business clients with their employee celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
Many employee parties are drastically down-priced. According to local 
professional party planners, the typical larger bashes, which once cost $50,000 
to $75,000 apiece, are now down to $20,000 to $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking a recession menu, real basic foods like meat loaf and puddings. 
Your Belgian truffles and New Zealand crab are out," said Parrott. "It's more 
pass-the-tray munchies, rather than fancy (food) tables." 
</P>
<P>
This new austerity was typified by a recent $3,000 party for about 150 guests 
at the private Modern Museum of Art in Santa Ana. It was hosted by Sterling 
Special Event Productions, a party planning service, and Bradford &amp; Ivy, a 
marketing firm, for business clients. 
</P>
<P>
While there were plenty of sparkling Christmas trees and an Ebenezer Scrooge 
capering on the disco floor, planner Darrell Hames cut decor and food costs 
with a "beach party" theme -- complete with patio tables and umbrellas and a 
main buffet fare of burgers, pizza and fettuccine. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one result of the belt-tightening going on among companies this year. 
You have to be more creative in ways to meet the reduced budgets. You have to 
find less expensive, more offbeat locations. All this and still have a lot of 
fun," Hames, a Santa Ana-based party consultant, said. 
</P>
<P>
Not all companies have abandoned the big employee parties on the regular 
hotel-and-banquet hall circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Consider just three Orange County-based companies that held their annual 
dinner-dances last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Fieldstone Co., a home builder, brought its 400 guests to the Ritz-Carlton 
in Dana Point. Avco Financial Services held its 1,500-guest party at an 
exposition building on the Orange County Fairgrounds. And PacTel Cellular's 
party for 1,000 was at the Disneyland Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the temper of the times was not forgotten. "Essentially, our party was 
still large-scaled because our employee force is still growing," said event 
coordinator Danee Miller for the Irvine-based PacTel Cellular. 
</P>
<P>
But, she added, "we decided to cut out some of the extras. It's being aware of 
the current mood and how other firms are being affected." 
</P>
<P>
Cutbacks or not, the idea of abandoning the big employee parties would be 
unthinkable, planners and others said. 
</P>
<P>
"These parties have always been essential to (employee) morale and recognition. 
It has always been our way of saying thank you to our employees," said 
Fieldstone's Mary Hendrickson, event coordinator for the Newport 
Beach-headquartered company. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, company coordinators and professional party planners asserted, they 
are counting on a rebound to the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Heavens knows, these things are cyclical," said corporate consultant Parrott. 
"Next Christmas might be a whole brighter picture again."

NORTH NET TRAINING CENTER

<P>
Gone is the concept of men in red suspenders sitting around the firehouse 
playing checkers, waiting for a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
Gone, the days of lines of people passing buckets of water hand-to-hand to put 
out the barn fire. Gone, even, is the firehouse Dalmatian. 
</P>
<P>
Enter a new age of high-tech computerization for Orange County's firefighters; 
an intricate glitzy system of reverse video, stereo sound and state-of-the-art 
communication, equipment and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
And for all those grown-ups who never let childhood dreams of being a 
firefighter fall by the wayside, the North Net Training Center in Anaheim is 
like being Indiana Jones in a set full of props. 
</P>
<P>
There is a concrete four-story burn tower to set on fire, wrecked cars to break 
into with the "Jaws of Life," non-energized electrical poles from which to 
rescue people, roofs to climb, trenches to pull people out of, a liquid 
petroleum unit to practice putting out gas fires, a communications antenna, a 
control tower, about a dozen fire hydrants, a simulator training room, a 
library and classrooms, plus several fire engines with all the prerequisite 
ladders, whistles and bells. In short, in terms of hands-on training, it's the 
next best thing to being there. 
</P>
<P>
But getting the opportunity to train at the facility isn't easy. There are only 
two ways to get in: already be employed in some capacity in the fire service 
field, or, the other, more popular method, enroll in a fire technology program 
such as the one at Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no longer a matter of pouring the wet stuff on the red stuff," said 
Richard Keller, deputy chief of the college's fire academy. "Fire chiefs got 
together to save taxpayers some money and put together a program for pre-entry 
training for prospective firefighters. Students are counseled, tested and 
evaluated to see if they have the skills to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Future firefighters who are diligent and enter the program are put through a 
grueling schedule of classes in physical sciences, safety, fire prevention 
practices, building construction, equipment and systems, and physical fitness. 
And students who are not up to par in a particular area can hone their skills 
while they're in college instead of at taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
"If they were going through the city, the city would have to pay salary, 
benefits and training only to find out they can't meet a standard. With this 
program, if they don't meet a standard, they can go back through until they 
do," Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
"Junior college is like boot camp. After students complete the course, they 
will end up with a two-year college degree and should be able to get their 
state firefighter certification," said Division Chief Ron Hamric, who oversees 
the Anaheim training facility. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the odds, there is never a shortage of eager men and women at the 
North Net Training Center, running up the stairs at the burn tower, black soot 
smudging their faces and clothes, carrying bulky hoses and equipment, probably 
wondering just what they've gotten themselves into. DALLAS M. JACKSON

Master Plan 
</P>
<P>
The Master Chorale of Orange County tossed a late-night party after Saturday's 
"Christmas for the Family" concert at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
About 200 friends of the ensemble gathered at the Garden Bistro restaurant in 
South Coast Plaza's Crystal Court for a lavish buffet and goblets of wine and 
wassail (hot cider). The $30-per-person event raised an estimated $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Daddy 
</P>
<P>
The beloved patriarch of this musical family is William Hall, the pink-cheeked, 
sparkle-eyed music director. Santa-like, Hall swooped into the party with good 
tidings -- and a bear hug -- for all. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the Bill-ettes!" said Mary Jane Coleman, who squealed with delight when 
Hall came over with a welcome kiss. 
</P>
<P>
"We're Bill Hall's professional entourage," joked Susan McKellar, who dined 
with Coleman and Betsy Critchfield. 
</P>
<P>
Along the same lines -- if somewhat more subdued -- were the comments of Cherry 
Rhodes, a concert organist and professor at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here because I'm a fan of William Hall," said Rhodes, who attended the 
concert and party with her husband, concert organist Ladd Thomas. "Bill is a 
wonderful musician, and he gives people a very good time as well as giving them 
great music. He's a very special performer. He has that gift." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buffet Bountiful 
</P>
<P>
The pickings were particularly good for a party that didn't even begin until 
almost 11 p.m. (Usually when a party starts that late, guests have to make do 
with carrot sticks or strawberries or sweets.) Garden Bistro laid a spread that 
included sauteed breast of chicken with wine sauce, quesadillas, smoked salmon, 
an assortment of finger sandwiches, muffins, fruit, crudites and cakes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faces 
</P>
<P>
Among revelers were Jane and Philip Winsor, of Laguna Hills. (Philip, a 
radiologist, conducted the "Silent Night" sing-along that ended the program -- 
an opportunity he bought in a live auction at a previous fund-raiser.) Also 
partying were soloist Deborah Winsor-Williams and her husband Nick Williams of 
Placentia; Barbara and Bob Johnson of Fullerton; Marina and John Dupuis of 
Laguna Niguel; Donna and Douglas Bunce of Santa Ana; and Mary Pew and Chris 
Galloway of San Juan Capistrano.

LITHUANIAN LEADER SAYS MOSCOW WILL CUT SUPPLIES JAN. 1

Lithuania's president said Tuesday that Moscow will try to bring his rebellious 
republic to its knees this winter by cutting off all supplies of food and raw 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
President Vytautas Landsbergis told a news conference here that Soviet 
officials have informed his government that food, fodder, energy and material 
shipments to Lithuania will end Jan. 1, ostensibly because of shortages in the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"All forces and all measures are going to be used to destabilize the situation 
in Lithuania and force it to remain part of the Soviet Union. They hope General 
Winter will be on their side," Landsbergis said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that citizens in his Baltic state have begun storing reserves for 
expected shortages and "I am convinced this winter is going to be a decisive 
one in our struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis met Monday with President Bush and saw Vice President Dan Quayle on 
Tuesday to appeal for U.S. support in Lithuania's drive to cast off Soviet rule 
and become an independent state. 
</P>
<P>
Bush restated U.S. policy urging self-determination for the Baltic states and a 
peaceful settlement to their differences with Moscow. Landsbergis said he is 
confident that Bush would not sacrifice Lithuania to keep Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in power. 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis plans to meet Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov in Moscow on 
Thursday. He said he will discuss the threatened economic blockade but that his 
main goal will be to lay the groundwork for stalled talks on independence.

U.S. MAY CALL FOR A NUCLEAR-FREE MIDEAST; 
</P>
<P>
WEAPONS: BAKER OFFERS SOVIETS QUALIFIED SUPPORT FOR SUCH A ZONE, IF IRAQ ENDS 
KUWAIT OCCUPATION.

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III gave tentative and qualified support 
Tuesday to a proposal by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze for a 
nuclear-free zone in the Middle East if Iraq agrees to end its occupation of 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to a joint press conference, Baker and Shevardnadze agreed that once 
the Persian Gulf crisis ends, the superpowers should play a role in a regional 
arms-control effort that could prevent Iraq from developing nuclear weapons and 
require Israel to destroy its existing arsenal of nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal seems designed to appeal to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who 
has long maintained that his country would agree to arms limitations provided 
that Israel was subjected to the same curbs. 
</P>
<P>
Israel, which would be unlikely to agree to such a proposal under any 
conditions, can be expected to be extremely wary of the idea now because of 
concern that Jerusalem might somehow be required to make concessions in 
exchange for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Baker and Shevardnadze completed two days of meetings in Baker's hometown and 
flew to Washington, where Shevardnadze will confer today with President Bush at 
the White House. In the joint news conference, Baker and Shevardnadze covered a 
wide range of issues: 
</P>
<P>
* Both men said they had made progress on resolving a few remaining 
disagreements on the text of a treaty reducing by more than one-third the 
superpower arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons, but they were unable to 
reach final agreement. As a result, they said, no date has yet been set for a 
summit between Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to sign the pact. 
</P>
<P>
* Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union will not send even a token contingent of 
its own troops to the Persian Gulf. Stressing that a peaceful settlement of the 
crisis is possible, he added, "It is also my strong hope that U.S. troops won't 
see action either." 
</P>
<P>
* Baker and Shevardnadze issued a joint statement calling for a cease-fire in 
Angola's long and bitter civil war. In a reversal of the previous Cold War 
rivalry, they announced that today in Washington, Shevardnadze will confer with 
Jonas Savimbi, president of the U.S.-backed UNITA rebel organization, while 
Baker will confer with Foreign Minister Pedro Van Dunem of the Soviet-supported 
government in Luanda. 
</P>
<P>
* Shevardnadze said the United States and the Soviet Union agreed to end arms 
supplies to rival factions in Afghanistan in an effort to end the civil war 
there. But he said no agreement was reached on the timing of the cutoff. 
</P>
<P>
* Baker said the United States and Iraq have not yet agreed on a date for his 
proposed visit to Baghdad. Shevardnadze endorsed the U.S. position that the 
visit should be no later than Jan. 3 because "it is our view that the sooner 
contacts are realized between the United States Administration and the Iraqi 
leadership, the better." Iraq has proposed a Jan. 12 date. 
</P>
<P>
* Baker and Shevardnadze exchanged documents indicating that two long-stalled 
treaties limiting nuclear explosions have been ratified by Congress and the 
Supreme Soviet. The Threshold Test Ban Treaty, negotiated in 1974, and the 
Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty, negotiated in 1976, had been held up until 
they were signed by Bush and Gorbachev earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze suggested a nuclear-free zone covering all of the Middle East when 
he was asked if he supports a U.S. proposal to maintain economic sanctions 
against Baghdad, even if Hussein peacefully ends his occupation of Kuwait, to 
prevent Iraq from developing nuclear weapons and again bullying its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"If Iraq withdraws from Kuwait on its own initiative and if it complies with 
all (U.N.) Security Council resolutions, then what we would have on our agenda 
as a next item would be . . . a nuclear-free and chemical-weapons-free zone in 
the Middle East," Shevardnadze said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the restrictions must apply to all countries in the region, including 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Baker carefully avoided using the words "nuclear-free zone." But he said he 
agreed with Shevardnadze that the world should address the Middle East arms 
race as soon as the gulf crisis has been resolved.

BUSH AND SHAMIR STEER CLEAR OF TOUCHY ISSUES; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: THERE IS NO MENTION OF ISRAEL'S REFUSAL TO ALLOW A U.N. PROBE OF THE 
TEMPLE MOUNT KILLINGS.

<P>
President Bush and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir met Tuesday, and the 
most telling aspects of their conversation were the issues they avoided. 
</P>
<P>
In nearly two hours of talks, Bush did not mention Israel's refusal to abide by 
a U.N. Security Council resolution ordering an investigation into the killing 
of Palestinians at Jerusalem's Temple Mount earlier this fall. 
</P>
<P>
And Shamir avoided emphasizing his government's determination to resist an 
international peace conference on the Middle East, a step many diplomats 
believe could help resolve the Persian Gulf crisis and one which the 
Administration has favored, under certain conditions, in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the two resolutely emphasized the positive. Bush complimented Shamir 
for Israel's "low profile" policy toward the crisis in the Persian Gulf. Shamir 
told reporters after the meeting that "I trust the President" and said Bush 
assured him that in trying to end the conflict with Iraq, "there will not be 
any deal at the expense of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Shamir, who also met with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, plans to meet today 
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who will be here for his 
own meeting with Bush. The meeting, the second between the Soviet and Israeli 
officials, comes as part of a series of high-level contacts as the two nations 
seek to warm their long-chilled relations. 
</P>
<P>
Although officials from both governments praised the "positive" tone of the 
Bush-Shamir meetings, they also made clear that no progress had been made 
toward finding a formula that might bring the region a step toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there was "a general agreement that with what is going on in the gulf, 
this is not exactly the best of times" for peace proposals, Avi Pazner, an 
adviser and spokesman for Shamir, told reporters after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Ross, a top aide to Secretary of State James A. Baker III, plans to 
travel to Israel next week to discuss Arab-Israeli talks, U.S. and Israeli 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials, who had avoided scheduling a Bush-Shamir meeting for 
months, hope the long-delayed visit will help Bush domestically by bolstering 
support for his gulf policies among backers of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, they have been eager to keep Israeli support for U.S. 
policies low-key, fearing that any overt Israeli involvement in the crisis 
would wreck cooperation with Arab members of the anti-Iraq coalition. 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, some Israeli officials have suggested that Israel might strike 
against Iraq's military if the United States reaches a gulf settlement that 
leaves Saddam Hussein's army intact. But Shamir avoided any such statements, 
saying that he offered "full support for the leadership of the President" and 
that Bush, in turn, "expressed his support for our behavior, for our policy." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Shamir has been looking for reassurances about the shape of U.S. 
relations with Israel once the gulf crisis is ended. He is also hoping for 
additional U.S. aid to handle the large numbers of Jewish refugees continuing 
to emigrate from the Soviet Union to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Officials estimate that as many as 1 million immigrants could arrive in Israel 
by the middle of the decade, costing the country as much as $40 billion to 
house and settle. 
</P>
<P>
Bush gave Shamir at least some of what he wanted. Bush "assured" Shamir that 
although the United States wants to "help out with the legitimate self-defense 
needs of our Arab friends," the Administration "will maintain a qualitative 
edge in armaments for Israel," according to Assistant Secretary of State John 
Kelly, who briefed reporters after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But the President was less forthcoming on the issue of immigration, telling 
Shamir only that his request for additional assistance would be "debated," 
Shamir said in brief comments to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"The President made no commitment other than a general interest in being 
supportive," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of immigration aid has been difficult for the Administration for two 
reasons -- the continuing tight federal budget and questions over whether 
Israel would use the money to settle immigrants in the West Bank territories. 
</P>
<P>
In briefing reporters on the Bush-Shamir meeting, Kelly insisted that the 
avoidance of the Temple Mount issue "was not a pre-decided tactic on our part." 
</P>
<P>
"The conversation evolved that way," he said. "Conversations flow naturally, 
and they take the course that they take."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the late 1970s, responding to public outrage over a case in which a New York 
City teen-ager was sentenced to only five years in detention for two brutal 
subway murders, the state Legislature changed the way juveniles involved in 
violent crimes were treated. 
</P>
<P>
In what soon became a booming national trend toward "man-sized punishment for 
man-sized crimes" over the next half decade, a host of states followed New 
York's lead -- California and Florida among them. 
</P>
<P>
One holdout was Massachusetts, which had pioneered a "rehabilitative" approach 
to juvenile justice and saw no reason to join the crowd. Massachusetts 
maintained its longstanding focus on community-based treatment for youthful 
offenders and resisted having juveniles tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, in a move that many leading authorities on juvenile justice 
contend signals an ominous turn of events in the rapidly rekindling national 
debate over how society should handle violent juvenile offenders, the 
Massachusetts Legislature adopted a "get tough" measure that makes it easier 
for juveniles charged with murder to be prosecuted as adults. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, which was signed into law last week by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, 
youths 14 to 17 who are charged with first- or second-degree murder will 
automatically be required to have a hearing before a judge to determine whether 
they should be transferred to adult court. The burden of proof will rest with 
their defense -- not with prosecutors, as is now the case. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the new Massachusetts law so portentous to many juvenile justice 
specialists is that it comes at a time when violent crime by juveniles is on 
the rise and many states have begun re-examining their juvenile justice 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
"Study after study has shown that these 'get tough' laws have no measurable 
deterrent effect on juvenile crime and that the bulk of kids waived to adult 
courts got lighter sentences than if they had remained in juvenile court," said 
Barry Krisberg, president of the San Francisco-based National Council on Crime 
and Delinquency. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, for example, only 4% of juveniles tried as adults under the 
stiffer provisions adopted in 1979 were given longer sentences than they would 
have gotten in juvenile courts, according to a State University of New York 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Massachusetts, meanwhile, could boast of having some of the lowest rates of 
juvenile crime and recidivism in the nation as testimony to its outlook on 
treatment of juvenile lawbreakers. A recent study showed that only 23% of 
Massachusetts' juvenile offenders were recommitted within three years, 
contrasted with 62% in California. 
</P>
<P>
But Massachusetts has not remained untouched by the dramatic growth in violent 
crimes by juveniles that has afflicted much of the rest of the nation in recent 
years. Over the past decade, the number of juveniles in Massachusetts charged 
with murder has shot up from an average of three a year to 15 a year, for a 
500% increase, much of it attributable to residents of drug-ridden inner-city 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Halloween night this year, an incident occurred that paved the way for 
the Legislature's recent action. 
</P>
<P>
In a case that has drawn comparisons to last year's "wilding" attack on a 
female jogger in New York's Central Park, a 26-year-old black woman, Kimberly 
Rae Harbour, was savagely beaten, raped and murdered in Boston's Dorchester 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Eight youths, ages 15 to 19, were charged in the crime, but five are legally 
considered juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
Legislators and lobbyists, including many parents whose children have been 
murdered by juveniles, hailed the bill. 
</P>
<P>
But critics contend that it represents an ominous step backward for 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
Della Hughes, who is executive director of the National Network of Runaway and 
Youth Services and co-chairs the Ad Hoc Coalition on Juvenile Justice, says 
Massachusetts has adopted the "quick-fix, simple-solution approach" that the 
nation increasingly is taking toward the whole array of mounting social 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of addressing the root causes, like poverty and poor housing and lack 
of education, we say: 'Let's lock them up,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gwendolyn Holden, executive vice president of the National Criminal Justice 
Assn., sees the Massachusetts bill as another in the increasing number of signs 
-- including the growing favor with which big-city mayors are looking upon 
curfews as a means of curbing juvenile crime -- that "get tough" policies still 
have appeal, as they did in the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say this issue is on the verge of a second coming," she said.

15 DIE, 50 HURT AS THICK FOG TRIGGERS 75-VEHICLE PILEUP

Two chain-reaction crashes in dense fog on a highway in southeastern Tennessee 
killed 15 people Tuesday, injured more than 50 and left the roadway looking 
like a war zone. 
</P>
<P>
A morning fog covered Interstate 75 over the Hiwassee River, about 40 miles 
north of Chattanooga, when the 75-vehicle pileup began about 9:30 a.m., said 
Cecil Whaley, director of the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
People involved in the accident, which covered more than a mile of the 
interstate, described hearing booms in the fog as dozens of tractor-trailers 
collided with each other and with cars. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling salesman Ralph Fisher, 43, of Cleveland, Tenn., was headed north when 
he hit the fog patch. He said he noticed traffic slowing down, so he pulled to 
the roadside. 
</P>
<P>
"After that I started hearing bangs and booms from everywhere. Immediately 
after that there was a truck on fire from across the road. We stared hearing 
them banging and booming from over there. Then, all of a sudden, you started 
hearing them from everywhere," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
Whaley confirmed 15 dead but said the number could rise as crews searched the 
burned shells of vehicles. In some cases, only nameplates distinguished the 
wreckage of cars smashed into the sides of trucks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the worst accidents that anyone can remember happening in 
Tennessee, in terms of the number of vehicles and fatalities involved," said 
Whaley, who followed rescue efforts from his Nashville office. 
</P>
<P>
Names of the victims could not be immediately released because some of the 
bodies were burned beyond recognition, Whaley said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe that an initial accident occurred in the southbound lanes 
and that cars jumping the median or people rubbernecking to see the southbound 
crash may have caused the second pileup in the northbound lanes. 
</P>
<P>
"There's unbelievable stories of tremendous bravery," Whaley said. 
"Firefighters were dragging out people whose trucks were on fire. They were 
getting them out just ahead of the flames. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a number of motorists who stopped to help. They were taking off 
their own clothes to bandage people. People were actually on fire, and they 
were beating out the flames." 
</P>
<P>
Russell Newman, eastern district regional director of the Tennessee Emergency 
Medical Agency, says no one is really sure what happened. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a conjecture as to what caused it, but it was just one of those damn 
chain-reaction collisions that happen in this kind of situation -- very heavy 
fog and probably too much speed," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the National Transportation Safety Board said it was dispatching 
a team of six experts in highway and hazardous-material investigations.

CRANSTON AIDE OFFERS FEW DETAILS OF S&amp;L EVENTS; 
</P>
<P>
THIFTS: CAROLYN JORDAN TELLS THE SENATE ETHICS PANEL SHE DID NOT KNOW OF 
KEATING CONTRIBUTIONS WHEN SHE INTERVENED ON BEHALF OF HIS FIRM.

Carolyn D. Jordan, aide to Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), said Tuesday she knew 
nothing about nearly $1 million in contributions that the senator solicited 
from Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr. when she 
intervened on Keating's behalf with federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
In her first public statement involving the "Keating Five" inquiry, Jordan 
repeatedly told the Senate Ethics Committee that she had no detailed 
recollection of many of the events that marked her involvement in the scandal 
that has ensnared her boss. 
</P>
<P>
As Cranston's representative on the Senate Banking Committee staff, she played 
a key role in his efforts to assist Keating in his battle with federal 
regulators who were investigating mismanagement at Lincoln between 1986 and 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
On one occasion, she recalled, she saw the California senator give Keating a 
brochure explaining the voter registration groups founded by Cranston. She said 
the senator asked Keating: "Take a look at one of my favorite projects." 
</P>
<P>
But she said she did not know until recently that Keating had made 
contributions of $850,000 to these groups. She added she had no personal 
knowledge of other contributions that Cranston obtained from Keating -- $60,000 
for his campaigns and $85,000 for the California Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, she said she was never asked by Cranston to assist Keating as a 
result of the thrift executive's unusual generosity. 
</P>
<P>
In a transcript of an earlier closed-door interview with the committee, which 
was made public on Tuesday, Jordan said she never made a distinction between 
those constituents from California who had contributed to Cranston and those 
who had not. "There's nobody in the damn state who hasn't contributed to him, 
Republican and Democrat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston and four other senators -- Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), Donald W. 
Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), John Glenn (D-Ohio) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) -- are 
facing an Ethics Committee inquiry into whether they intervened improperly on 
behalf of Keating in exchange for contributions. The committee also wants to 
know if their actions delayed the government's takeover of Lincoln, which lost 
$2 billion in federally insured funds. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who has worked for Cranston since 1971, acknowledged that she contacted 
regulators at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board on a number of occasions at the 
request of Keating or his lobbyist, James Grogan. But she said she never 
applied any pressure on the regulators to do anything improper. 
</P>
<P>
She said she only "tried to elicit information from them about what they were 
doing" in the course of their lengthy investigation of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan also indicated she seldom -- if ever -- sought permission from Cranston 
before she called the bank board to express the senator's concern about a 
pending matter involving Lincoln. After 20 years as an aide to Cranston, she 
said, she generally knew what the senator expected of her without asking. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan said she never questioned Keating's contention that he was being 
unfairly harassed by the regulators and made no independent inquiry into 
whether these claims were accurate. But she emphasized it was standard practice 
for Cranston's staff to contact regulators on behalf of constituents without 
inquiring about the accuracy of their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
She said it was not until February, 1989, that she learned from a bank board 
official that Lincoln might have been lying about its net worth. Until then, 
she was persuaded that Lincoln was one of the soundest thrifts in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever Keating's aides contacted her, Jordan said, they asked her to schedule 
meetings with the regulators, to urge regulators to negotiate with them or to 
obtain information. "Each time there was a meeting (with Keating or his staff), 
there was a new twist or a new problem they were having with the bank board," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1988, she said, Grogan apparently indicated to her that Keating would 
like members of Congress to conduct a hearing into the bank board treatment of 
Lincoln. She said she contacted the House Banking Committee about holding a 
hearing because the Senate committee did not have the time or resources to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
No such hearing was ever held. 
</P>
<P>
Although she normally dealt with Grogan, Jordan said, she had dinner with 
Cranston and Keating in Los Angeles in December, 1988, when the thrift 
executive first indicated his desire to sell Lincoln. She also said she spent 
three days at the Phoenix headquarters of American Continental Corp., Lincoln's 
parent company, in April, 1988, at Keating's expense. 
</P>
<P>
When Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) questioned the propriety of her trip to Phoenix, 
she replied: "Certainly a couple of days trip is not going to cloud my 
judgment." 
</P>
<P>
In an affidavit released on Tuesday, Kenneth A. McLean, the former staff 
director of the Senate Banking Committee, said Cranston and Jordan were active 
within the Senate to aid Lincoln in its bitter dispute with regulators. 
</P>
<P>
When then-Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.) offered an amendment in 1987 that 
would have reasserted the authority of federal regulators to limit direct 
investments by state-chartered thrifts, such as Lincoln, Cranston told McLean 
that he opposed the amendment. Jordan also contacted McLean several times on 
the issue, according to his affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment later was dropped by Proxmire. 
</P>
<P>
"Although I was unaware in late March, 1987, of the political contributions 
Sen. Cranston had received from Mr. Keating, it occurred to me at the time that 
deleting the amendment, as advocated by Sen. Cranston, would benefit Lincoln," 
McLean said. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, rebutting McLean's comments, said he had a reputation for "chicanery." 
</P>
<P>
McLean also said that Cranston and Jordan were advocates for the 1986 
appointment of Lee Henkel, a Keating ally, to the three-member bank board. 
</P>
<P>
Proxmire, the Banking Committee chairman, opposed Henkel's appointment because 
the nominee operated companies that had $55 million to $60 million in loans 
from Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
When Congress failed to act on the nomination, Henkel got a recess appointment 
after Congress adjourned for the year. He then immediately proposed that the 
bank board modify the investment rule in a way that would have helped Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
A worried Proxmire promptly ordered an investigation of Henkel. The committee 
investigator, Bart Naylor, learned that Lincoln had bought stock, of uncertain 
value, from one of Henkel's companies. 
</P>
<P>
Naylor contends that Jordan tried to thwart his investigation. When asked about 
it, Jordan said she had no recollection of talking to Naylor about Henkel. 
</P>
<P>
Henkel later resigned from the bank board after the Justice Department began an 
inquiry into his activities.

COMMUNIST VICTORY IN SERBIA MAY SIGNAL START OF YUGOSLAV BREAKUP; 
</P>
<P>

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Communism's sweeping election victory in Serbia may have eased fears of a 
military coup, but it sets up what observers say is a worst-case-scenario for 
durable peace and Yugoslav unity. 
</P>
<P>
The only hope for avoiding a breakup of the federation was for Serbia to elect 
a democratic president or a Parliament willing to negotiate a more equitable 
relationship with Slovenia and Croatia. Yugoslavia's two most prosperous 
republics plan to secede unless they are granted economic and military 
autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Serbian voters gave strong endorsement to incumbent President Slobodan 
Milosevic and the nationalist policies of the former Communists, now renamed 
but little reformed as Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
"If the results are such that the opposition has failed even to win a majority 
in the Assembly, then it means the end of Yugoslavia," said a senior Western 
diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of Milosevic and what amounts to hard-line communism isolates 
Serbia, the largest republic, from four other Yugoslav states that have elected 
center-right governments and set about repairing the economic damage inflicted 
by half a century of Marxism. 
</P>
<P>
The Socialists have remained popular in Serbia despite an anti-Communist mood 
in Eastern Europe because Milosevic used his political monopoly to reassert 
Serbian authority over ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province and by threatening 
to use force to prevent Slovenia and Croatia from seceding. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's vote showed that Milosevic enjoys broad support in his efforts to 
subjugate Kosovo Albanians and for his tough talk against independence for the 
northern republics. 
</P>
<P>
Balkan bureaucracy continued to delay full returns even two days after the 
polls closed, but government and opposition sources concurred Tuesday that the 
Socialists appeared to have won by a landslide. 
</P>
<P>
Milosevic had 62% of the presidential vote in the precincts where the count was 
deemed official, and those figures appeared to be consistent with preliminary 
results from other districts, according to Election Committee spokesman Zoran 
Djumic. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders said their independent counts suggested that the former 
Communists might win as many as 200 of the 250 seats in the Serbian Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The Socialists won because of a widespread fear of change and their complete 
control of the state-run media, according to leaders of the main opposition 
group, the staunchly nationalist Serbian Renewal Movement. They have lodged 
numerous complaints of voting fraud and manipulation, but they accepted the 
Socialist victory as valid. 
</P>
<P>
"The Communists stole a lot of the vote, but we feel they couldn't have stolen 
as much as they won by," said Stanko Kustrin, a campaign activist and Belgrade 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
Vuk Draskovic, the movement's presidential contender, won only 17% of the vote, 
according to the partial returns. 
</P>
<P>
The bearded novelist, who had been considered a strong challenger to Milosevic, 
was visibly shaken by the loss and denounced the electorate for choosing 
"bondage and Bolshevism" over the democracy and economic reform championed by 
his anti-Communist movement. 
</P>
<P>
Draskovic and his party share the same radical views as the Socialists on the 
Kosovo conflict, but the opposition has been more conciliatory toward Slovenia 
and Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
Milosevic has refused to negotiate a realignment of relations within the 
federation or to reduce the economic burdens placed on the two northern 
republics. 
</P>
<P>
Slovenia and Croatia accuse the Socialist-controlled federal government of poor 
economic management, blaming Belgrade -- the capital of both Yugoslavia and 
Serbia -- for the federation's $16-billion foreign debt, rising inflation and 
unemployment that has left nearly one in five Yugoslavs without a job. 
</P>
<P>
The northern republics also have sought to distance themselves from the human 
rights abuses repeatedly registered in Kosovo, where the population, 90% ethnic 
Albanian, has been under Serbian police siege for nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
Before Sunday's voting, opposition activists said they feared that the 
Socialists would stir up trouble in Kosovo if they failed to win decisively. 
They speculated that provoked violence would draw a military crackdown by 
Belgrade and create sufficient unrest to warrant postponement of the second 
round of elections set for Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav defense minister, Gen. Veljko Kadijevic, said a week before the 
vote that the army preferred a Socialist leadership, which triggered fears of a 
military coup in the case of an opposition victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect calm in Serbia now, but I fear for Yugoslavia," said Alexander Ptic, 
a recent UC Berkeley graduate who returned to campaign for Draskovic and his 
anti-Communist movement. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Socialist rule has been legitimized in Serbia, the northern republics 
will more easily win backing from the West for their secession efforts, since 
there is no hope of uniting democratic and Communist governments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the worst thing that could have happened for Yugoslavia as a nation," he 
concluded. "What can we say to the West now? Only that Serbs are still stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats agreed that the Socialist victory will accelerate the 
secession efforts but noted that the victors now have to prove they can correct 
colossal economic mistakes of their own making. 
</P>
<P>
An official with Yugoslavia's largest bank, who did not want to be identified, 
said Serbia has recently run up debts in excess of $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The Communists raised workers' salaries to create an atmosphere that 
everything was fine in the republic," said Dejan Lucic, Belgrade leader of the 
Serbian Renewal Movement. "But the money is not there to cover those debts, and 
there's not going to be any help from the West for a Communist government." 
</P>
<P>
Several opposition figures said they hope that Serbia would be financially 
isolated by the West, to hasten what they expect to be broad disenchantment 
with the Milosevic leadership within the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
"There will have to be new elections soon," predicted Mihailo Mladenovic, 
president of the Serbian Royalist Bloc. "Yugoslavia is bankrupt -- Serbia as 
well -- and we can't expect help from anyone because we have already squandered 
our credit." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and opposition figures said they worry that Serbia, and Yugoslavia by 
extension, was headed for a "Bulgaria scenario." Disillusionment with the 
elected Socialists in Bulgaria mounted in the months after the June election 
there, eventually bringing down the government in late November. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia will face the additional pressure of its most prosperous republics 
trying to bolt from the federation, undermining any hope of economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Slovenia plans a referendum on secession on Dec. 23, which is expected to gain 
at least 80% support and set the independence juggernaut in motion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Slovenia and Croatia, Yugoslavia's two most prosperous republics, have said 
they plan to secede unless they are granted economic and military autonomy. 
Slovenia plans a referendum on secession on Dec. 23. It is expected to gain at 
least 80% support, which could start the wheels of the independence movement 
turning.

The ruling Communist Party in Albania decided to allow the formation of 
political parties, the state news agency ATA said. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise decision to liberalize politics in the Balkan nation was made 
during a meeting of the party's policy-setting Central Committee. Albania would 
be the last country in Europe to introduce a multi-party system. The Central 
Committee meeting was held following student unrest that started over the 
weekend. ATA said the Central Committee also fired five full members and one 
candidate member of the Politburo. Some observers said the reshuffle and the 
call for independent parties was a defeat for hard-liners.

DESPITE ADVANCES, STEREOTYPES STILL USED BY MEDIA 
</P>

<P>
Even the most severe critics of the nation's news media concede that there is 
now much greater sensitivity in the portrayal of minorities. 
</P>
<P>
But ethnic stereotypes continue to appear. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Times story last year described a Chinese poker player as 
"inscrutable" and as a "classically serene Asian," for example, and a Times 
fashion layout showed a Latino model, wearing a Latino designer's clothes -- 
walking alongside a graffiti-scarred wall. 
</P>
<P>
"Do all Latinos live surrounded by graffiti?" asks Alan Acosta, assistant 
hiring editor at The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Racially insensitive and offensive language contributing to harmful stereotypes 
also remains common: 
</P>
<P>
* The New York Times, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, Time and Newsweek -- 
among others -- have used the words "invade" or "invasion" when speaking of the 
influx of Asian-American immigrants or Asian-American business acquisitions in 
this country; Asian-Americans say this invokes damaging images and memories of 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
* The Los Angeles Times, Boston Globe, Washington Post, Philadelphia Inquirer 
and Chicago Tribune, among others, have used the word "aliens" to describe 
immigrants who are here illegally; Latinos say this word makes them seem 
inhuman -- strange outcasts from another world. They would rather be called 
"illegal immigrants" or "undocumented workers." 
</P>
<P>
* When a woman jogger was beaten and raped in Central Park last year, the New 
York Times and Washington Post (among others) called her black attackers a 
"wolf pack," but these papers used no such bestial imagery to describe the 
whites who murdered blacks in Howard Beach and Bensonhurst. 
</P>
<P>
* Television sports commentators, in particular, speak of white athletes as 
being "smart" or "brainy" or as having worked hard; black athletes are often 
described as "natural" or "pure" athletes, "gifted" with great speed or 
strength or jumping ability. These formulations ignore the "natural" physical 
abilities of many white athletes and the demonstrated intelligence of many 
black athletes -- as well as the hours and years of practice many black 
athletes put in developing their skills. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Ford, a black reporter at the Los Angeles Times, recalls that when 
Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, a white 
colleague at the Detroit Free Press, where she then worked, wrote a caption for 
a photograph of Tutu dancing in celebration. 
</P>
<P>
The caption said Tutu "broke into a jig." 
</P>
<P>
Ford says she tried to explain that "jig" was a derogatory term for "black" and 
that it was both ignorant and insulting to suggest that a native of a country 
with the rich folk dance traditions of Africa would break into an Irish dance. 
Her arguments initially were rejected, Ford says, and she had to appeal to a 
higher-ranking editor before prevailing.

SEATTLE TIMES USES DIRECT APPROACH IN MINORITY COVERAGE; 
</P>
<P>
JOURNALISM: ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF APPARENT SALARY DISPARITY SPARKED DISCUSSIONS ON 
A VARIETY OF ISSUES. THE RESULT WAS THAT MORE DIVERSITY APPEARED IN THE 
NEWSPAPER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Four years ago, editors at the Seattle Times were instituting a 
"pay-for-performance" salary system when they discovered what they thought was 
a troubling disparity -- many minority staffers generally appeared to be paid 
less than their white colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Most editors -- most executives in any business -- would probably have 
concealed that data or, perhaps, tried to quietly correct the situation. But 
Michael Fancher, executive editor of the Seattle Times, circulated the 
information to the staff, hoping it would stimulate discussion and perhaps 
reveal other inequities and problems that required attention at the paper. 
</P>
<P>
The appearance of racist literature on the desks of two blacks at the Seattle 
Times shortly before release of this information had already created some 
uneasiness among blacks in the newsroom, so there was indeed much discussion 
about salaries and other racial matters. Although subsequent analysis showed 
that the salary disparity was smaller than it appeared, other inequities and 
problems were found in minority coverage and employment. Committees were 
formed. Reports were written. 
</P>
<P>
Result: Even though minority population in Seattle is substantially less than 
in most big urban centers -- about 29% in the city, 15% in the metropolitan 
area, mostly blacks and Asian-Americans -- the Seattle Times has been far more 
resolute and innovative than most papers in trying to cover that population 
adequately and in trying to diversify its newsroom to help achieve that 
objective. 
</P>
<P>
"Seattle is a richly diverse community," says Fancher, a white, "and we wanted 
that diversity reflected in our newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
When Fancher released the information on salaries, minorities formed a 
committee, interviewed outside consultants and brought in Marilyn Gist of the 
University of Washington to study the paper. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone liked Marilyn," said Lee Moriwaki, editor of one of the paper's 
suburban bureaus, "but I think there was some sense that there were too many 
meetings, too much talking." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, out of Gist's interviews with 22 staff members and her report 
came 17 one-day racial awareness seminars and a series of recommendations for 
diversifying the staff and news pages. Meanwhile, there were considerable staff 
discussions, more meetings, memos and a Diversity Committee was formed. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the paper has made a major effort to cover more 
minorities in routine stories. Photographs of minorities increased 45% -- and 
photos of minorities in a positive or neutral context more than doubled -- 
during one 14-month period, according to the paper's periodic content review. 
</P>
<P>
Some staff worried that this emphasis would lower the paper's news standards, 
that quotas would replace news judgment. Fancher says the paper is not lowering 
standards, just "re-evaluating them." 
</P>
<P>
As members of the paper's Racial Awareness Pilot Project said in a May 31 memo 
to the staff: 
</P>
<P>
"We're not interested in 'token' reporting on minorities or producing 'good 
news' that otherwise wouldn't make it into the paper." 
</P>
<P>
Many at the paper were skeptical. Some worried that management would begin to 
measure -- and reward -- performance based solely on coverage and inclusion of 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Marsha King, a white reporter at the paper and coordinator of the pilot 
project, was convinced that the program would work only if it were "a 
grass-roots effort, not something imposed from the top down." She did not want 
it seen as "an effort on the part of the paper to be a social missionary but as 
something to make us a better paper." 
</P>
<P>
When King sought volunteers for the first stage of the pilot project, she found 
only eight -- and only one minority. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people of color felt they were already doing things to bring diversity to 
their stories," said Jerry Large, a black assistant city editor. "This was a 
chance for others to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The pilot project began May 1, with the volunteers consciously emphasizing 
diversity in their daily work whenever possible and monitoring the results. 
Members of the project team attended minority meetings, read minority 
publications, developed a list of minority sources to be consulted on various 
subjects, and questioned minorities who had written letters to the editor 
critical of the paper's minority coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The project opened many eyes and many doors, but it was not as successful as 
had been hoped, in part, because "we were basically a bunch of white folks 
talking about issues we probably didn't fully understand," team members said in 
a written report to the staff in October. 
</P>
<P>
That report cited a number of stories and photographs either made possible or 
enriched by team members' heightened awareness. The team also gave a slide show 
presentation to the staff, discussing "what had worked and what didn't and . . 
. sharing our own fears (about the project)," King said. 
</P>
<P>
That presentation "crystallized for the rest of the staff" the objectives and 
potential of the program, King said, and a second, larger phase is under way, 
with less skepticism, less resistance and about twice as many participants, 
including several minorities. 
</P>
<P>
The paper has a newsroom staff that is 16% minority, and minorities make up 10% 
of the editors -- both numbers more than double the industry average. But 
Fancher says he feels frustrated by the paper's inability so far to bring 
minorities in "at the highest levels of the newsroom," and that is where 
attentions are focused, both in recruitment and in-house training. 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, Managing Editor Alex MacLeod sent a letter to 400 minority 
journalists around the country, asking for applicants and recommendations in 
trying to fill two key editing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
He said he has had more than 50 replies and conducted "about a dozen in-depth 
telephone interviews." Two prospects have been flown to Seattle for interviews, 
and both were offered jobs. One declined, the other is considering the offer, 
he said.

Frustrated by the poor performance of 75-millimeter cannons in an effort to 
shoot down avalanches in the Sierra Nevada, state transportation officials are 
trying gas blasters triggered by remote control. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans says that five of the curved, 17-foot blasters have been installed in 
steep terrain over U.S. 50 on Echo Summit. The area, just west of Lake Tahoe 
and about 90 miles east of Sacramento, is often hit by avalanches. Four more 
gas blasters are to be installed by next year.

DEVERE BAKER; SAILED OCEAN ON RAFTS TO BACK MORMON DOCTRINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DeVere Baker, a Mormon who sought to establish the authenticity of his church's 
views on the first peoples to visit American shores by making a series of 
daring raft trips over a 30-year period, has died. 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Breeze, a Torrance-based newspaper, reported that Baker was 75 when 
he died Dec. 5 of what was described as a long illness. 
</P>
<P>
Baker was best known for his sea adventures on a series of rafts he named Lehi. 
From 1952 to 1979, he sailed -- sometimes successfully, sometimes not -- in an 
attempt to show that the Book of Mormon is correct and that members of some of 
the Lost Tribes of Israel had crossed the sea to North America. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike primitive rafts, Baker's were equipped with electronic navigation gear 
and could be propelled by outboard motors. 
</P>
<P>
On Lehi IV in 1958, he managed to successfully drift to Hawaii from California 
to prove that crossing oceans by raft was an ancient probability. Lehi V had 
been built for what was to have been a six-year around-the-world trip in 1963, 
but it was damaged by rough seas. 
</P>
<P>
He funded the initial voyages from money he had earned in the sale of two 
shipyards that had proved successful during World War II. More recently, he had 
been soliciting funds from friends and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for another Lehi voyage were shelved when Baker's health began to fail 
several years ago. He suffered a heart attack in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Baker wrote a series of books on his faith and his adventures, many of which 
ended in Coast Guard rescues. In 1980, he made a brief bid for the nation's 
presidency as a world peace candidate, but withdrew after a loss in the 
Democratic primary in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
"The other candidates are all millionaires," he said at the time. "At least I 
will give the people a choice -- someone who is broke." 
</P>
<P>
His survivors include his wife, Nola, of San Pedro.

FDIC SAYS COSTS FROM BANK CRISIS TO TOP $4 BILLION; 
</P>
<P>
BANKS: PROFITABILITY ALSO FELL SHARPLY IN THE THIRD QUARTER. FOURTH-QUARTER 
DECLINES ARE EXPECTED AS THE RECESSION SPREADS AND REAL ESTATE LOANS GO BAD. 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's worsening banking crisis is taking a heavier than expected toll on 
the government's deposit insurance fund this year, with losses soaring to an 
estimated $4 billion, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said Tuesday that his agency's estimate of the 
deposit insurance fund's 1990 losses because of bank failures has increased 33% 
in just the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
The bank insurance fund will end the year with slightly more than $9 billion in 
reserves to back $2 trillion in deposits, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman's comments at a press conference came as the FDIC reported that the 
nation's commercial banks suffered a 29% decline in profitability during the 
third quarter, as bad real estate loans continued to drag down the balance 
sheets at many institutions, especially in the Northeast. Net income for the 
nation's banks totaled $3.8 billion during the period, down from $5.4 billion 
during the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman warned that fourth-quarter figures for the banking industry will also 
be bleak, especially as the recession spreads and more real estate loans turn 
sour. Banks in the West, including California, however, are still outperforming 
those in other regions of the country, the FDIC said. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, 17.2% of all banks in the West were losing money, but 
58.9% of the region's institutions reported higher profits than in the previous 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman's grim new figures on deposit insurance follow a far more optimistic 
forecast that he made at the beginning of the year, when the fund had roughly 
$13 billion on hand. At that time, Seidman predicted that the fund would break 
even in 1990 and end the year with $13 billion still in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
But the latest estimate means that the FDIC has seen roughly half of its 
insurance fund disappear in the past three years; the fund ended 1987 with more 
than $18 billion on hand. 
</P>
<P>
With losses mounting, Seidman warned that the FDIC and the Bush Administration 
may seek congressional approval early next year for a plan to bolster the 
deposit insurance system and increase confidence in the banking system, which 
is now under greater pressure than at any time since the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a radical plan to overhaul the nation's banking system set to be 
unveiled in January, Seidman said the Treasury Department is studying whether 
to force the nation's banks to provide new financing to infuse cash into the 
insurance fund. But Seidman insisted that the Bush Administration proposal will 
not include a request for more taxpayer money for deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a recapitalization plan as soon as possible," Seidman said. The 
solvency of the fund is not in question, he stressed. But he added that "it's 
increasingly clear that the fund should have a recapitalization plan in place 
if it is needed. The banks will have to come up with more money. But this won't 
cost the taxpayers anything." 
</P>
<P>
Seidman didn't detail just how banks would be asked to provide extra financing, 
and FDIC officials acknowledged that the agency is still studying whether the 
nation's increasingly fragile banks can afford to pay more to bolster the 
insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Bush Administration and the FDIC are also examining a proposal 
that would require weaker banks to pay higher premiums for deposit insurance 
than would healthy banks. Currently, deposit insurance premiums are not 
adjusted to take into account the fact that the government runs a higher risk 
by insuring deposits at poorly managed banks than it does by backing deposits 
at financially stable institutions. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the FDIC's board received a new recommendation from the agency's 
staff that calls on the Bush Administration to introduce such "risk-based" 
premiums as part of its banking reform package. 
</P>
<P>
That Administration package will encompass a broad range of highly 
controversial proposals, including one that would give regulators more 
flexibility to let big banks fail when they get into trouble, rather than prop 
them up as the government has done in the past. That would represent a dramatic 
change in federal policy and would, in effect, bring to an end the government's 
past practice of covering all of the deposits in failed institutions, even more 
than the $100,000 coverage per account. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Bush Administration may seek to restrict insurance coverage to 
three accounts per individual depositor, to cut back on the government's 
exposure when it is forced to liquidate weak banks. But the plan could go 
beyond a reform of deposit insurance and also call for full, interstate banking 
as well as the repeal of the Depression-era prohibition against bank 
involvement in securities trading. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration is pushing for such a radical overhaul of the financial 
system because it believes that Washington can no longer ignore the threat the 
banking crisis poses to the national economy. 
</P>
<P>
So far in 1990, 134 commercial banks have failed, including 35 in the third 
quarter alone. And now, the FDIC has more than 1,000 other banks on its 
"problem list" of institutions that are weak and may eventually require a 
government bailout.

JAMES FLANIGAN: HAMMER HAD VISION OTHERS LACKED 
</P>

<P>
Armand Hammer, who died Monday night at age 92, was an entrepreneur on a grand 
scale, one of a rare breed who make a difference in worldwide business, in good 
ways and bad. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer was admired for his unceasing energy and for his efforts on behalf of 
better relations between the Soviet Union and the United States. He also made 
enemies -- among people in the oil industry who blamed him for making a 
separate deal with Libya in 1970 and opening the gate to higher energy prices, 
and others who criticized him for running Occidental Petroleum as a personal 
fiefdom. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that entrepreneurs such as Hammer are not necessarily model 
citizens. But through their quick wits and daring they often contribute to 
change in the world and set an example of how much business can really 
accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer was part of a rare breed. Others like him in business today include Ted 
Turner, Rupert Murdoch and Akio Morita -- prickly personalities but with a lot 
more dash and daring than typical corporate managers. 
</P>
<P>
Business to Hammer was more than the pursuit of money. Hammer died rich, to be 
sure -- his stock holdings in Occidental Petroleum are worth more than $30 
million. 
</P>
<P>
But after a business career spanning seven decades, Hammer was not rich enough 
to qualify for Forbes magazine's list of the 400 richest Americans -- partly 
because his personal wealth had been reduced by millions given in philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer, like all entrepreneurs, had an instinct for making a dollar. He made $1 
million even before he graduated from medical school by buying and selling 
supplies of ginger -- a key ingredient for a popular semi-alcoholic drink in 
Prohibition New York. He also sold real whiskey, which he later said he had 
purchased before the Prohibition law took effect. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the Soviet Union, where Hammer went in 1921 with medicines from his 
family's pharmacy in the Bronx, that he achieved his greatest success. He had 
an entree to the market because his family had emigrated from Odessa, and his 
father was a prominent Socialist who knew Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
But Hammer didn't simply sell medicines and come home. He saw that the country 
was starving, so he set up a deal to bring in U.S. grain in exchange for 
Russian furs. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't stop there. Seeing needs to fill in the Soviet Union, Hammer became 
an importing agent for Ford Motor, U.S. Rubber, Underwood typewriters, Parker 
Pen and dozens of other firms. 
</P>
<P>
In order to get the right to import, he set up a network of fur-trapping 
stations in Siberia so that he could expand fur exports. 
</P>
<P>
Today, U.S. business people have difficulty figuring out how to get paid in the 
Soviet Union. But entrepreneurs are seldom stalled by such difficulties. In 
Hammer's case, the Soviet government, which was a partner in his trading 
company, could pay him only in unconvertible rubles. But Hammer saw art 
treasures in the Czar's Hermitage Palace in Leningrad and asked for some of 
them in exchange for his work. He later sold the Russian art works in American 
department stores and through his own art gallery in New York. 
</P>
<P>
In 1925, the Soviet government took Hammer's trading company into state 
control. So he started a pencil factory -- which was not an easy thing to do. 
The technology of pencils, according to a 1980 article in Forbes, was 
controlled at that time by A. W. Faber Co. of Nuremberg, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer went to Nuremberg and paid higher wages to lure away Faber's workers and 
their know-how. Within six months, Hammer had a new factory set up on the 
outskirts of Moscow, turning out $2.5 million in pencils per year. 
</P>
<P>
Three decades later, Hammer was to use the same tactic to hire away exploration 
talent from major oil companies for Occidental Petroleum. And the tactic worked 
again. In Libya in the 1960s and in Colombia in the 1980s, Occidental teams 
discovered big oil fields on prospects that had been picked over and discarded 
by the giants Mobil and Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
But other oil companies blamed him for giving the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries the upper hand in 1970 when Occidental buckled to the 
demands of Libyan ruler Muammar Kadafi, who wanted more money for Libya's oil. 
</P>
<P>
As a small company, Occidental was vulnerable, of course, but also 
entrepreneurs often see a little into the future. A year after Libya, the shah 
of Iran -- with the tacit backing of the U.S. government -- routed the oil 
companies and took control of the oil price for OPEC. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer went on to build a good-sized company, with $20 billion in revenue last 
year -- a long way from the couple of wells in which he had invested $50,000 in 
1956. He built the company by wit and promotion, often using his art collection 
as a calling card with communities and countries in which he sought oil 
concessions. He promised the art collection to the Los Angeles County Museum, 
but later reneged and housed it in a monument to his own name. 
</P>
<P>
He also hung on long past normal retirement and indulged in numerous projects 
that others saw as ego trips. 
</P>
<P>
But one person's ego trip is another's grand gesture. After the nuclear power 
plant accident at Chernobyl in 1986, Hammer underwrote the mission of U.S. bone 
marrow specialists to treat the radiation victims. Hammer's critics said he was 
bucking for the Nobel Peace Prize, but so what? The important thing is that the 
specialists got to the radiation victims. 
</P>
<P>
What do we get from entrepreneurs such as Hammer? We get new ideas, said 
economist Joseph Schumpeter. Hammer's new idea was to see beyond ideology to 
what business could accomplish -- an idea embraced today in the Soviet Union. 
Take him, warts and all: Hammer made a difference.

THE OUTLOOK FOR OCCIDENTAL; 
</P>
<P>
A LARGER-THAN-LIFE MAN IS RECALLED 
</P>

The world greeted the death of industrialist and philanthropist Armand Hammer 
in as richly varied a way as it reacted to his life: with awe and praise for 
his endeavors on the international stage, tempered by diplomatic silence, 
criticism and even relief from some of his many antagonists. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer, 92, the chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp., died Monday night at 
his home in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles after a brief illness. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer was lauded for his decades of unofficial diplomacy between the United 
States and the Soviet Union, his enormous financial support of cancer research, 
his business instincts that led to huge oil discoveries around the world and 
his creation of an eminent art collection that hangs in great museums. 
</P>
<P>
But he was also remembered as the dupe of Libyan leaders whose eagerness to 
make money in the 1960s paved the way for the first global oil crisis and the 
rise of OPEC. And he was criticized as an extreme self-promoter and 
double-dealer who, among other deeds, incurred the wrath of the Los Angeles art 
community over his recent failure to keep a promise to the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art . 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Hammer was portrayed as larger than life. 
</P>
<P>
"He was at the intersection of history so many times, in oil as in U.S.-Soviet 
relations," said Daniel Yergin, author of "The Prize," a history of oil 
politics. "He was there for the beginning of communism and there for the end of 
it. There's nobody else who can say that." 
</P>
<P>
Hammer had long been suspect in some quarters for his close ties to the Soviet 
Union, which dated to powerful political and business contacts he forged there 
in the 1920s. His self-publicized diplomatic efforts, not always at the 
invitation of the White House, drew mixed reviews to the end. 
</P>
<P>
Harvard University Sovietologist Marshall Goldman credited Hammer on Tuesday 
for playing a "very positive" role as messenger and intermediary between 
several U.S. administrations and the Soviets, helping to defuse such crises as 
the 1978 arrest of an International Harvester executive in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"He was always claiming to have accomplished so much that people would 
pooh-pooh what he said," said Goldman. "He left himself open for criticism when 
in fact there were concrete things that he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who has supported efforts to award 
Hammer the Nobel Peace Prize, said Tuesday: "We could not have ended the Cold 
War without him . . . . Few private citizens in American history have done more 
to serve the public interest or the cause of international understanding." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, through a spokesman, said, "Mr. Hammer 
is associated with some of the most valuable pages in Soviet history." He sent 
"sincere condolences" to Hammer's family. 
</P>
<P>
But the White House had no comment on Hammer's death, even though George Bush, 
as vice president, was among many prominent figures who contributed blurbs to 
the book jacket for Hammer's last autobiography, "Hammer." 
</P>
<P>
Also declining to make the customary comment on the passing of a world figure 
Tuesday were former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former National 
Security Adviser Zbignew Brzezinski, who once called Hammer a "pretentious 
self-promoter." 
</P>
<P>
Others spoke darkly about Hammer's Soviet ties. Arnold Beichman, a Soviet 
affairs scholar at the conservative Hoover Institution, described him as an 
"agent of influence" who was "very valuable to the Soviets." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his political battle through the 1980s with Hammer over Occidental's 
effort to drill for oil in Pacific Palisades -- a plan killed by Los Angeles 
voters in 1988 -- City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky had nothing but good things 
to say about Hammer on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"He was someone who . . . believed in himself and in the art of the possible," 
Yaroslavsky said. "He accomplished things others only dream about." 
</P>
<P>
In the oil industry, Hammer was long regarded as an outsider and a maverick, a 
reputation he earned in the 1960s when his fledgling Occidental Petroleum 
entered the big leagues of oil with massive discoveries in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, oilmen hold Hammer in ill repute for his tactics in getting into 
Libya -- and later, when he was desperate to avoid Libya's seizure of the 
reserves, for breaking the long-established formula for splitting oil profits 
between governments and oil companies. The result was a newly emboldened OPEC, 
historians agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that his contribution was more to the shareholders of Occidental 
than to the industry," said Richard Stegemeier, chairman of Unocal Corp. 
"Occidental was not known to be a great leader in research or innovative 
creativity that was shared with the industry. It was more of a company that 
looked out for itself and did a very good job at that." 
</P>
<P>
While Hammer's name appeared on a number of autobiographies, one author of a 
more searching book on Hammer's life could not help but express relief at news 
of his death. 
</P>
<P>
Investigative reporter Steve Weinberg -- author of a 1989 biography of Hammer, 
"Armand Hammer: The Untold Story" -- has spent most of the last year preparing 
for a trial of Hammer's defamation lawsuit against him and his British 
publisher. The trial was to begin in April in London. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer objected to 173 passages in the book, Weinberg said Tuesday. But with 
Hammer dead, Weinberg's attorneys and publisher expect the lawsuit to be 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer's admirers acknowledged the depth of reactions this very public man 
provoked. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone had strong feelings about him," said Dr. Robert Gale of UCLA, the 
bone-marrow transplant specialist whom Hammer flew to the Soviet Union to treat 
victims of the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986. "Either they liked him or 
they didn't like him. He was a friend, a personal friend, so I'm very sad."

MARVIN DAVIS WANTS FIRST INTERSTATE TO SELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis revealed Tuesday that he owns a 
"significant amount" of First Interstate Bancorp's stock and suggested to its 
directors that now may be the "ideal time" for them to sell the struggling 
banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' move did not trigger a major immediate reaction, but some analysts and 
investors suggested that Davis -- a major corporate raider -- may be trying to 
spark a shareholder revolt or proxy fight. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to directors through First Interstate Chief Executive Edward 
M. Carson, Davis said he is dissatisfied with the bank's management, saying he 
has "watched with distress" the bank's "deteriorating financial condition." He 
suggested that the Los Angeles-based banking firm, historically plagued by high 
overhead costs, find ways to operate more efficiently or look for a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
With a net worth estimated by Forbes magazine in October at $1.65 billion, 
Davis has some of the deepest pockets around. Still, investors generally 
shrugged off the letter. First Interstate's stock hardly moved, finishing the 
day at $25.125 per share, up 37.5 cents, in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is not sure how to read this," said Donald K. Crowley, a banking 
analyst in San Francisco for Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and his associates declined to comment on the letter. Davis did not 
reveal how much First Interstate stock he owns, but he is known to typically 
buy 3% of the shares in companies he is active with. Davis made huge profits on 
his stock holdings after threatening last year to buy the parent companies of 
Northwest and United airlines. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate has been hit hard during the past year by losses stemming from 
its ill-fated move into Texas in the late 1980s and problems in Arizona, where 
the economy has softened. 
</P>
<P>
Simon Barker-Benfield, a First Interstate spokesman, said the bank was unaware 
that Davis was a shareholder until he sent the letter. 
</P>
<P>
"We take his concerns seriously as we do the concerns of all of our 
shareholders. We also are encouraged by the progress we have made so far this 
year," Barker-Benfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Investors and analysts said Davis is probably hoping to ignite a revolt among 
the handful of institutional shareholders who control First Interstate's stock. 
Some 70% of the stock is owned by institutional investors, with nearly half 
owned by six institutions. 
</P>
<P>
One possibility is that Davis may launch a proxy fight to pressure management. 
Indeed, his letter was released publicly by the well-known proxy solicitation 
firm D. F. King &amp; Co. A D. F. King spokeswoman said the firm frequently 
releases financial information for clients. She said releasing the letter does 
not mean that Davis is using the firm's proxy solicitation services. 
</P>
<P>
Investors and some securities analysts discounted any threat and questioned 
Davis' conclusion that now is the time to sell the bank. They cited the serious 
slump in the banking industry and, more important, the small number of 
potential buyers who could pull off such a large transaction. 
</P>
<P>
"This is hardly an ideal time to sell a bank or parts of a bank," said John 
Neff, who heads Windsor mutual fund, one of First Interstate's largest 
shareholders. Neff is one of the bank's most vocal critics. 
</P>
<P>
The list of potential buyers is growing shorter all the time. Security Pacific 
Corp., once at the top of the list, acknowledged this week that it won't be 
expanding for at least a year in the wake of the $320-million to $360-million 
loss it expects to post in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Large New York banks once considered likely buyers of California banks, such as 
Citicorp and Chase Manhattan, are having their own huge problems and are in no 
position to swallow such an acquisition. Japanese banks as well are under 
pressure in the wake of Japan's real estate and stock market slump. Large 
regional banks are loaded with problem real estate loans or are still working 
through other acquisitions. Banks that could buy First Interstate, notably New 
York giant J. P. Morgan, have no interest in retail banking. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves two most likely candidates: BankAmerica Corp. and Wells Fargo &amp; 
Co. Neither is likely to make a bid unless it is on friendly terms, and 
industry executives believe it is unlikely for now that First Interstate's 
management would want to do that. In addition, Wells Fargo and BankAmerica are 
digesting large savings and loan acquisitions, and also face uncertainty next 
year because California's economy is softening. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, nearly 10% of First Interstate's shares are held by Kohlberg 
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the huge investment firm. Earlier this year, KKR 
willingly granted First Interstate an agreement in which it will not sell to a 
buyer without First Interstate's permission until February, 1992. First 
Interstate management has portrayed the investment as friendly. 
</P>
<P>
Any suggestion that Davis may try to buy the bank himself was widely 
discounted. Banking industry lawyers and executives said the layers of state 
and federal regulatory laws would be so cumbersome that it would be virtually 
impossible. All told, Davis would have to go through at least 14 state banking 
regulators and at least three federal ones. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, they said, regulators would undoubtedly frown on Davis' reputation 
as a corporate raider. In addition, regulators would scrutinize the financing 
of the acquisition because banks by nature are highly leveraged.

Trial Date Set for Bush, Others: U.S. District Judge Sherman Finesilver 
scheduled an Oct. 7, 1991 trial date for a $200-million civil lawsuit against 
Neil Bush and other key figures in the collapse of Silverado Savings &amp; 
Loan. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. filed the lawsuit against the president's 
son and 12 other former Silverado directors, attorneys and executives in 
September. The suit claims that the officials were "grossly negligent" in their 
management of Silverado, which collapsed in 1988. The bailout of the thrift is 
expected to cost taxpayers about $1 billion. The suit claims that the 
defendants authorized excessive compensation to management and approved a 
series of loans and other deals that drove the $2.3-billion thrift into 
insolvency.

EQUITABLE PROPOSES NEW OWNERSHIP PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: TO QUICKLY RAISE NEEDED CAPITAL, THE FIRM MAY TAKE STEPS LEADING TO 
A PUBLIC STOCK OFFERING.

Equitable Life Assurance Society, the nation's third-largest life insurer, said 
Tuesday that it plans to radically alter its ownership structure in a move it 
hopes will enable it to quickly raise needed capital. 
</P>
<P>
Equitable said it plans to transform itself from a mutual insurance company, in 
which policyholders essentially own most of the company, into one in which 
public stockholders will be the owners. If the plan is carried out, Equitable 
will become the largest U.S. life insurer to "demutualize." 
</P>
<P>
Insurance industry analysts said the conversion most likely will take at least 
two years to carry out, and possibly much longer. A formal plan must be 
approved by the company's board and by regulators. It must be voted on by 
certain categories of policyholders. Such conversions typically give rise to 
major lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
But in a telephone interview, Richard H. Jenrette, Equitable's chairman and 
chief executive, said the three investment banking firms that Equitable has 
retained have devised a plan under which the company may use the conversion to 
raise capital much sooner. Equitable hopes to sell debt securities that will be 
convertible into Equitable stock once the conversion is completed, Jenrette 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jenrette said the company -- which, like other large insurers, is facing some 
significant financial problems -- hopes to raise at least $500 million in 
several installments by selling such convertible notes or bonds. If the 
demutualization should fail to take place, he said, the company would be 
obliged to pay back investors. Jenrette said the conversion will be carried out 
under a new New York state law that may allow the process to be completed 
sometime in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement follows reports about significant financial troubles at 
Equitable. The New York-based company is facing major losses, in part because 
of the declining value of its investments in real estate, mortgage loans and 
junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's lowered its rating of 
Equitable's claims-paying ability to A from A+. The agency also lowered ratings 
on insurance and debt issued by several Equitable subsidiaries. It said the 
company will remain on its Credit Watch list with "negative implications" and 
said its rating of Equitable's commercial paper could be downgraded soon. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P said: "Today's announcement that it plans to demutualize indicates that 
the company recognizes its need to seek significant external capital." 
</P>
<P>
Concern about Equitable's financial health reached a crescendo several weeks 
ago, when a rumor swirled through the financial markets that the company was 
about to file for bankruptcy protection. The rumor was swiftly denied. 
</P>
<P>
Jenrette said Tuesday that "there are some problems, but they're not 
life-threatening." He added: "Equitable is not in bad financial shape." 
</P>
<P>
Jenrette said the conversion was being carried out to give the company more 
flexibility in raising capital. He said the change has been under consideration 
since shortly after he became chief executive in May. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Equitable's move may prompt other big life insurers to follow 
suit, possibly including the two largest, Prudential Insurance and Metropolitan 
Life. Many are under intense pressure to raise capital, in part because of 
expected losses on investments. 
</P>
<P>
Equitable was founded in 1859 as a stockholder-owned company. But, along with 
some other New York insurers, it converted to mutual ownership in 1918 at the 
recommendation of the New York state Legislature, after scandals that had 
rocked the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance industry analysts William Bitterli of Northington Partners and 
Frederick Townsend of Townsend &amp; Schupp, both in Connecticut, said the 
conversion back to stock ownership is unlikely to have a negative impact on 
policyholders, who may realize a financial gain. 
</P>
<P>
Equitable said it plans to carry out the conversion by issuing stock to 
policyholders who now have an ownership stake in the company. The policyholders 
would be able to sell the stock when Equitable makes a public offering of 
shares. It remains to be worked out how much stock qualified policyholders are 
likely to receive. 
</P>
<P>
Although policyholders technically own the mutual insurance companies, in 
practice they have had little say over company affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Jenrette, who came to Equitable after the company's financial problems prompted 
the departure of Chief Executive John B. Carter, has some experience taking 
companies public. Jenrette is a founder of the Wall Street firm Donaldson, 
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities, which was the first Wall Street firm to sell 
its own stock to the public.

STATE MAY REJECT HMO RECOMMENDATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to complaints from some health maintenance organizations, the 
California Public Employees Retirement System is expected today to reject a 
consultant's recommendation that it drop seven of the 19 HMO plans that it 
offers state employees. 
</P>
<P>
The CalPERS health benefits committee is recommending that the system's board 
not use the A. Foster Higgins &amp; Co. study of HMO performance alone to make 
a decision on which plans to offer its 327,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
The study recommended that CalPERS drop seven HMOs that rated low on numerous 
criteria, including financial stability, methods of choosing and contracting 
with physicians and other health-care providers, data reporting, service-area 
coverage, quality assurance, utilization management and efficiency of 
administration and providing member services. 
</P>
<P>
But some HMOs that were rated low, including FHP International Corp. in 
Fountain Valley and Maxicare Health Plans Inc. in Los Angeles, complained that 
the report did not accurately reflect their operations and performance. 
</P>
<P>
A vice president at FHP said its poor score may have resulted in part from the 
fact that the Foster Higgins questionnaire had been filled out by an FHP 
employee who didn't understand the significance of the survey. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee doesn't want to discontinue a good health plan solely based on a 
report that may have been filled out by someone in the firm who didn't know how 
to do it," said Bob Walton, assistant executive officer for CalPERS. He added 
that the health benefits committee voted unanimously to recommend that CalPERS 
use the study only as an initial tool for evaluating quality of service. 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of its analysis, Foster Higgins recommended CalPERS drop Maxicare, 
FHP, Travelers Health Network of California Inc., Bay Pacific Health Plan, 
Lincoln National Health Plan, PCA Health Plans of California and Health Plan of 
the Redwoods.

QUASAR MUST PAY $2.5 MILLION IN BIAS CASE

A subsidiary of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. has been ordered to pay 
nearly $2.5 million in penalties and costs for discriminating against 
non-Japanese staff in the United States, lawyers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling by federal Judge James Alesia stems from a jury verdict returned in 
1988 against Quasar Corp. of Franklin Park, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Three former employees of Quasar sued the company alleging that they were fired 
in 1986 during a cutback but that their Japanese counterparts in management 
were not. 
</P>
<P>
They also said non-Japanese managers were excluded from meetings where the 
reductions were discussed and that the company maintained a different salary 
and evaluation structure for its non-Japanese workers. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita, which recently agreed to buy entertainment giant MCA Inc. for $6.13 
billion, distributes consumer electronic goods in the United States under the 
Quasar, Panasonic and Technics brands. 
</P>
<P>
A spate of purchases of major American properties by Japanese concerns has 
raised fears that heavy foreign investment is compromising American 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
A court order telling Quasar to pay nearly $2.5 million in penalties, court 
costs and legal fees was issued Friday and distributed Tuesday by the law firm 
that represented the three former workers. 
</P>
<P>
The court found that Quasar violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that outlaws 
discrimination by employers on the basis of national origin. 
</P>
<P>
Quasar issued a statement saying it was disappointed by the ruling and will 
appeal.

MARKET BEAT: MERRILL SETS NEW ETHIC BY REINING IN NOVICE BROKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you've ever gotten the fast hard sell from a young stockbroker, you know the 
feeling: Whether or not you buy what the broker is touting, you're often left 
feeling abused. And if you buy and the investment bombs, you may vow never to 
trust another broker. 
</P>
<P>
This week, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. announced a plan to combat what has become 
an epidemic of hard sell by the industry's freshman brokers. Merrill will keep 
all of its new brokers in training -- and on salary -- for two years, rather 
than the current 20 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to remove the pressure that young brokers often feel to make sales, 
and thus generate commissions, to stay afloat financially while building a 
client base. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill's move could have repercussions beyond its own business. Other firms 
prefer not to admit it, but Merrill often sets standards for the industry. And 
there have been few other brokerage issues in recent years that have become as 
serious as young brokers' desperate grab for commissions. 
</P>
<P>
Much of what brokerages have done in recent years has actually made life 
tougher for young brokers rather than easier, encouraging them to sell with 
reckless abandon. As business overall has slumped, many firms have cut the 
percentage of commissions that new brokers receive to about 30% from about 34% 
in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Although older brokers who are bigger producers have seen their commission 
payouts hold or in some cases rise -- at some firms, such as Prudential-Bache, 
top producers get 45% of the commissions they generate -- the cuts on the low 
end dragged the average broker percentage take down to 36.7% last year from 
39.8% in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
That has created a vicious circle. New brokers earn less per sale, so they must 
sell more. The pressure thus mounts to spend less time with each potential 
customer, going instead for volume. But by ignoring the brokerage business' 
cardinal rule -- Know Your Customer -- many young brokers have put clients' 
money in disastrous investments. The situation has been worsened by the stock 
market's slump and the collapse of junk bonds since mid-1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen young brokers get into some very bad habits over the last four to 
five years," says Laurence Hoffmann, a 47-year-old broker for Prudential-Bache 
Securities in Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
One extreme problem has been the tendency for young brokers to rely on one or 
two hot products, Hoffmann and other older brokers say. Many new brokers, for 
example, found it easy to sell junk bonds in the late 1980s. So that's all they 
learned to sell, with little regard to the bonds' suitability for all 
investors. When the junk crash came, those brokers were left with horrified 
customers -- most of whom quickly became ex-customers, and some of whom sued. 
</P>
<P>
Merrill Lynch believes that by extending its training period to a full two 
years and by paying new brokers a salary for that period rather than forcing 
them to live off commissions, it will encourage "the highest degree of 
integrity" among its brokers. The benefit for the firm, of course, is that 
better-trained brokers should result in happier customers over the long run. 
</P>
<P>
Shouldn't other firms follow Merrill? Shearson Lehman says it already keeps new 
brokers on salary for their first 16 months. But at most firms, brokers must 
begin producing within a few months of being hired. Moreover, though it may 
shock the average investor, most brokerages don't even have formal training 
programs. Indeed, firms such as Merrill, Shearson and Dean Witter Reynolds have 
long been training grounds for virtually the entire industry: Brokers often 
start at those firms, then jump to smaller brokerages without more training. 
</P>
<P>
Many brokerage executives argue that paying a salary to new recruits isn't the 
solution to halting dangerous sales techniques. At Dean Witter Reynolds in New 
York, spokesman Jim Flynn says the firm has no plans to change its current 
training program, which places most brokers on commission after six months to 
one year. 
</P>
<P>
The key to ethics control, Flynn says, is to have a strong manager at each 
branch office -- someone who keeps track of what and how the brokers are 
selling. "Especially right now, the manager really has to manage," Flynn says. 
"You have to watch those (sales) tickets." 
</P>
<P>
To their credit, several major brokerages also say they will beef up retraining 
of older brokers and branch managers in 1991. Merrill is creating a new 
"advanced training" program for experienced brokers and says it will change the 
compensation of its branch managers to reward them for how well their brokers 
meet clients' needs. And Merrill will give all brokers a certificate worth 
$100,000 in 10 years if they stay with the firm, meet performance criteria and 
avoid client complaints of poor service or improper investments. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson plans to put 2,000 of its 9,000 brokers through a new training program 
that will focus on quality of service rather than new products, a spokeswoman 
says. The firm is also discussing a new branch manager training program that 
would emphasize service. 
</P>
<P>
From the individual investor's point of view, many of these steps are overdue. 
It also doesn't help much that most brokerages have cut back severely on the 
number of broker-trainees they'll take on in 1991. The new programs would have 
done far more good had they been in place during the salad days of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Still, this is a start. If Wall Street is to restore its credibility with 
individual investors, it must begin at the broker level. Know Your Customer 
must be reinstated as the guiding rule for securities salespeople, and those 
brokers who won't take the time to follow that rule should find something else 
to do for a living. 
</P>
<P>
BROKERS' SHRINKING PIE 
</P>
<P>
Stock brokers' average commission generation has shrunk since the 1987 market 
crash -- and so has the share of commissions the brokers keep.

LOOKING AHEAD / PAUL SAFFO: PROS NEEDN'T FEAR NEW TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL SAFFO, PAUL SAFFO is a research fellow at the Institute for the Future 
in Menlo Park, Calif. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The prospect of losing one's job to a machine has rarely troubled white-collar 
professionals, secure in the assumption that computers powerful enough to 
threaten their livelihood exist only as science fiction fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the threat may be more immediate, as a designer friend recently 
concluded. He thought that the arrival of desktop publishing in the late 1980s 
would drive him out of work. 
</P>
<P>
The essence of his fear is that modest computer technology has taken the skill 
out of design and packaged it into software. The same pattern is affecting 
other professions: Spreadsheet programs perform tasks once reserved for 
accountants; on-line databases invite users to become their own librarians; 
even lawyers are getting the jitters as companies introduce software programs 
that help users write their own wills. 
</P>
<P>
But let's look at what is really happening. Spreadsheets are commonplace in our 
offices, yet accountants and bookkeepers are busier than ever. And advanced 
desktop publishing tools are quickly becoming fixtures in design offices. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that only the simplest part of what professionals do is being 
packaged into programs. At the same time, however, computers are also changing 
the nature of professional work in profound and unexpected ways. Today's 
librarian is occupied helping users thread their way through databases that 
were supposed to make library work obsolete. Lawyers have become profligate 
users of on-line research systems and personal computers are quickly replacing 
calculators as the accountant's most basic tool. 
</P>
<P>
My designer friend fears the consequences of seeing the skills of his trade 
sold as software, but the real headache for professionals is more likely to be 
the constant "reskilling" required for professional survival in an information 
age. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge lies not in finding work to do, but in finding the time to do 
work between continuing education seminars and efforts to learn how to use new 
computer systems before they become obsolete. Effective professional use of 
information technologies also requires more than just retraining. More often 
than not, getting value out of a new computer system involves fundamental 
changes in organizational structures, furthering professional anxieties about 
the impact of machines on jobs. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, our new information tools are certain to change the nature of 
professional work beyond recognition. More than a few job categories will 
disappear, but newer tasks enabled by computer technology will emerge as well. 
This will be painful for those averse to change, but the impact on those who 
make the effort to keep up will be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of this shift are visible in many professions today. More than a few 
librarians have abandoned institutional jobs to become highly paid electronic 
information consultants, and accountants routinely advise clients on computer 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
Editors and writers have found new jobs in corporate publishing made possible 
by laser printers and word processors. Stock traders and financial analysts are 
discovering new ways to go into business on their own by leveraging computers 
and communications links to gain the sort of information leverage once 
accessible only to big players. 
</P>
<P>
Even designers are getting into the act. My friend is so busy teaching design 
principles to desktop publishers that he hardly has the time to worry about the 
now-remote possibility that he will be replaced by a machine.

PEOPLE: MULLEN NEW CHIEF OF MAY CO., CALIFORNIA

<P>
May Department Stores Co. has appointed David P. Mullen to succeed Kenneth F. 
Sokol, who is retiring as president and chief executive of its Los 
Angeles-based May Co., California division. 
</P>
<P>
Mullen, previously was president of Filene's, a 19-store May Department Stores 
division based in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
He will assume his new position on Jan. 15. May Co. California includes 37 
stores in Southern California and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Mullen, 56, began his career with the Cleveland-based Higbee's department store 
chain, serving in a variety of merchandising positions before joining the 
Washington-based Woodward &amp; Lothrop department store chain in 1972. He was 
named president of Woodward &amp; Lothrop in 1972. He joined the St. 
Louis-based May Department Stores in 1988 as president of the Phoenix-based 
Goldwaters department store division, relinquishing the post the same year to 
take the position at Filene's. 
</P>
<P>
Sokol, 62, is retiring after a 31-year career with May Department Stores. He 
joined the California division as a buyer in 1960 and subsequently held 
merchandising positions at three May Department Store divisions. He returned to 
May Co. as president of the Southland retailing operation in February, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The division's sales grew steadily during Sokol's tenure, said Richard L. 
Battram, vice chairman of May Department Stores. The California division had 
sales of $740 million when Sokol was named president in 1986. Sales in the 
current fiscal year are expected to reach the $1-billion level, Battram said. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said Sokol is leaving the division in a relatively strong 
competitive state. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar S. Mangiafico continues as chairman of May Co., California. 
</P>
<P>
May Co. -- the third largest division within the 303-store May Department 
Stores chain -- had sales of $954 million in the fiscal year ended Feb. 3.

FASHION: IN THE PERFUME GAME, A CELEBRITY'S IMAGE MAY MEAN THE SWEET SMELL OF 
SUCCESS -- BUT NOT ALWAYS.

Lips are sealed as to what actually happened in that out-of-court settlement 
between Elizabeth Taylor and her onetime boyfriend, Henry Wynberg. But some 
perfume pundits suggest that Liz should have given Henry a generous settlement 
for all the free publicity her lawsuit and his countersuit generated for her 
best-selling fragrance just as the holiday season kicked into high gear. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the dispute over who got what profits and just who concocted the floral 
scent seemed as if it could have been devised by a diabolically clever 
advertising team. Lurid sexual histories, greed and long-dead passions were 
splashed across front pages of newspapers across America generating name 
recognition that publicists drool over. 
</P>
<P>
"Given that it's a few weeks before Christmas, the timing is extraordinary," 
sighed Lawrence Pesin, whose firm, Colonia, puts out a celebrity fragrance 
called "Moments," personified by Priscilla Presley. Analysts say the fragrance 
industry rakes in about half its $4 billion in sales during the December 
shopping frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
With eyes of violet and a perfume bottle to match, Liz is reigning comfortably 
over the celebrity scent market with $70 million in annual sales from the 
fragrance she launched with Chesebrough-Ponds in 1987. (Two years later she 
added Elizabeth Taylor's "Passion for Men.") 
</P>
<P>
But a host of other celebrity scents with such coy names as "Only," "Misha," 
"Moments," "Listen," "California," "Spectacular," "Sophia," "Deneuve," "Forever 
Krystle," "Electric Youth," "Undeniable" and "Uninhibited" are now jockeying 
for space on the increasingly crowded shelves of department stores and 
drugstores and even in the satchels of door-to-door Avon ladies. 
</P>
<P>
Overkill, you might ask? 
</P>
<P>
Not on your life, say most distributors, who add that as long as American women 
have ears, they will yearn to dab the newest celebrity perfumes behind them. 
</P>
<P>
There are 800 fragrances on the market and 60 new scents debut annually. But 
with six out of seven failing, and fragrance sales down 40% this holiday 
season, celebrities offer perfume manufacturers an invaluable 
cachet-by-association in an industry that hawks hope by the pricey half-ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity scents are most successful when a host of intangible and mundane 
variables come together, including the star's image, the way that image is 
promoted in an attempt to strike an emotional chord with the buying public, 
relentless in-store appearances with all the trappings of a three-ring circus 
and lastly, a pleasing "juice," as scents are known in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Besides "Passion," "Jaclyn Smith's California," Priscilla Presley's "Moments" 
and Mikhail Baryshnikov's "Misha" are some of the success stories cited by 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
But celebrity scents can belly-flop when even one variable veers out of orbit. 
Cher's "Uninhibited," Joan Collins' "Spectacular" and Catherine Deneuve's 
"Deneuve" show that star quality does not necessarily ensure a successful 
perfume. Analysts say all three were potential mega-sellers whose marketing 
campaigns failed to capture the imagination and pocketbooks of the fickle 
public. 
</P>
<P>
The complicated tango that brings stars and fragrances together varies with 
each set of players. Contact is often initiated by manufacturers, who present 
marketing proposals and vie with each other to make a deal. But celebrities are 
often just waiting for a good opportunity to license their names. 
</P>
<P>
Some are content to adopt a laissez-faire attitude and leave the fragrance 
testing to the experts, collecting a licensing fee and customary royalties of 
3% to 5%. Others shudder at slapping their name across a product they haven't 
personally supervised, tested and approved. 
</P>
<P>
Ballet dancer, choreographer and actor Mikhail Baryshnikov, for instance, whose 
women's fragrance "Misha" has enjoyed success, insisted on creative control 
over all details from the design of the bottle -- a conical shape suggesting 
twirling, or perhaps a pirouette -- to the packaging, marketing and the scent 
itself, according to Richard Barrie, president and chairman of Richard Barrie 
Fragrances Inc., a small perfume marketer in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Baryshnikov received $250,000 last year for putting his name on the fragrance. 
He is guaranteed an annual licensing fee that increases to $750,000 by 1995, 
according to reports. Barrie, who spent 23 years with Faberge before launching 
his own firm, said he wooed the ballet star for months, winning a commitment by 
promising to start a company devoted to the fragrance. 
</P>
<P>
Credited in the fragrance industry with running a shrewd marketing campaign, 
Barrie expects $7 million in retail sales for 1990, recouping his $4 million in 
initial promotional costs. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't looking for big dollars. We were looking for a foothold and an 
opportunity to grow and establish a world-class brand that . . . in 10 years 
will be a classic," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Some public relations departments go to great lengths to paint their 
celebrities as people of infinite creativity who spend months tracking down the 
elusive blend of orangeflower, patchouli, sandalwood, gardenia, jasmine and 
ylang-ylang that will make the public swoon. 
</P>
<P>
"Jaclyn was involved in every step of the process," says a press release by Max 
Factor for "Jaclyn Smith's California," which also quotes the actress: "My new 
fragrance has the freshness of flowers and warm wood undertones. It's very 
sensuous, but with California's lively sparkle." The perfume debuted in April, 
1989, and sales were in excess of $50 million in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Dee Williams, whose fast-moving fragrance "Undeniable" is sold 
door-to-door by Avon Products and is expected to pull in $22 million in sales 
this year, was not involved in creating the scent, according to Evette O. 
Beckett, Avon's director of fragrance marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"We pretty much led the project ourselves," she adds. "Of course, we reviewed 
it with him and he was pleased with it. But he didn't necessarily have 
approval." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes scents can backfire even when celebrities participate in the entire 
process. Cher's "Uninhibited," manufactured by a subsidiary of Avon Products 
called Parfums Stern, shows how easily star fragrances can turn into stinkers. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't quote me, but it bombed," sniffs one competitor of the scent, whose 
bottle mixes Art Deco and heavy-metal hardware. The flash is capped by an 
opaque plastic seashell nestled in a studded metal crescent moon -- but it has 
disappeared from most department stores. 
</P>
<P>
"The fragrance and the packaging didn't work at all," says Annette Green of the 
Fragrance Foundation in New York. "Cher is a sexy, opinionated woman and I 
don't think the marketing campaign conveyed that. I mean, what does Cher have 
to do with Art Deco?" 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, purchases zoomed whenever Cher made in-store appearances. 
Salesclerks dutifully doled out chain-mail earrings with each purchase to evoke 
outfits worn by the well-sculpted star, and sales were $15 million in 1988. But 
sales tapered after Cher stopped stumping for "Uninhibited," and analysts say 
the fragrance did less than $10 million in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
Considering that the scent may have outsold Barishnikov's, is that so bad? 
</P>
<P>
"That was a brand they had high expectations for a certain size market and 
longevity," says Susan Babinsky, a market analyst who tracks the fragrance 
industry for the Kline Group in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
In March, Sanofi Beauty Products, which bought Parfums Stern from Avon this 
year, put "Uninhibited" on the auction block, and industry analysts say Cher 
bought back the distribution rights and is shopping for a new distributor. 
</P>
<P>
"Cher felt that it would not be fair to ask (her fans) to continue to buy a 
perfume that did not live up to her quality standards," her publicist said in a 
prepared statement. "Cher maintains that Parfums Stern did not live up to its 
initial promises regarding the packaging, marketing and distribution." 
</P>
<P>
Another scent that nose-dived was "Deneuve," named after classically beautiful 
blond actress Catherine Deneuve and distributed by Avon Products. Women 
apparently were put off by Deneuve's ice-queen look and the scent evaporated 
alongside Avon's profits. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Cheseborough Ponds' research into the popularity of Elizabeth 
Taylor indicated the actress's romantic, schmaltzy image and her series of 
personal misfortunes inspired awe as well as empathy in men and women of all 
ages, sexes and colors. Almost everyone could relate to Liz on some level, from 
her well-publicized marriages and love affairs to bouts with substance abuse 
and illness, charity work and lifelong battle with weight. 
</P>
<P>
"People love Liz, they feel protective of her. She's the last great star," says 
the Fragrance Foundation's Green. 
</P>
<P>
She is also a great target, analysts say. Wynberg's suit was the second one 
filed over her perfume. Several years ago, Parisian perfumer Annick Goutal sued 
Taylor for using the name "Passion," which Goutal had trademarked and used for 
one of her own best-selling perfumes. La Liz's fragrance -- which her publicist 
said she was intimately involved in selecting and marketing -- is now known 
officially as "Elizabeth Taylor's Passion." 
</P>
<P>
Squeaky-clean teen singer Debbie Gibson's "Electric Youth," which did a brisk 
$15 million in sales last year, illustrates that perfumes don't need universal 
appeal to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Electric Youth" comes in a hot-pink half-ounce bottle ($8.50 per half-ounce) 
and smells like strawberry bubble gum. Gibson's teen-age fans have spritzed 
themselves silly on the stuff and Revlon tied in marketing to Gibson's 1989 
"Electric Youth" album, which sold 4 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
Some advertising ploys seem downright hokey. When Jaclyn Smith couldn't make 
some of the in-store appearances that Max Factor had scheduled for her 
"lifestyle" fragrance "Jaclyn Smith's California," the firm put up life-size 
cardboard cut-outs instead. 
</P>
<P>
And some press agents get carried away, too. A spokeswoman for "Undeniable" by 
Billy Dee Williams suggests that the perfume bottle "is very curvaceous. It 
sort of reminds you of a woman." 
</P>
<P>
"Billy Dee is not just a pretty face," she says. "He has an artistic side and 
he's a very sensual person. Who better than Billy Dee Williams to know what a 
woman would want in a perfume?" 
</P>
<P>
It's too early to know whether many of today's celebrity scents have the "legs" 
(staying power in perfume parlance) to take their place among classics such as 
Chanel No. 5 and Guerlain's "L'Heure Bleue." Some released in the past 10 years 
-- Sophia Loren's "Sophia," Linda Evans' "Forever Krystle" (after her 
character, Krystle Carrington, on the soap opera "Dynasty") and Candice 
Bergen's "Cie" -- had strong heydays but are faltering or have already fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
Dionne Warwick's "Dionne" fragrance dropped off perfume counters last year and 
reappeared as prizes for dancers on the TV show, "Soul Train." 
</P>
<P>
But research has shown that it's never too late to begin marketing a celebrity 
scent. 
</P>
<P>
The executors of the estates of Ernest Hemingway and Elvis Presley are 
considering licensing the dead stars' names for celebrity scents.

FAITH: WHAT DO CHILDREN BELIEVE IN? DR. ROBERT COLES, WHO HAS SPENT 30 YEARS 
TALKING TO KIDS ALL OVER THE WORLD, HAS FOUND A PERVASIVE SENSE OF 
SPIRITUALITY.

<P>
In nearby Lawrence, Robert Coles asked a fourth-grader if God ever gets tired. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, and with animation, the child responded, "Maybe He does and maybe He 
doesn't," then added, "He's God, so He can't get tired." 
</P>
<P>
In Stockholm, Sweden, a 10-year-old boy told Coles he couldn't draw Jesus with 
the crayons offered to him. "The Lord is everyone's, so He's not white and He's 
not brown or black. He's all the skin colors and the eye colors. It's hard to 
imagine Him; that's why I'll just use a pencil." 
</P>
<P>
And nearly 30 years ago, an 8-year-old black girl in North Carolina explained 
to Coles how she stayed calm in the face of hostility from segregationists. "I 
was all alone, and those people were screaming, and suddenly I saw God smiling, 
and I smiled," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Though he had heard many such remarks over the years, Coles only recently 
pondered their significance. A Harvard-trained pediatrician and child 
psychoanalyst, Coles spent more than 30 years working with children and writing 
about them. "The Spiritual Life of Children" (Houghton Mifflin, $22.95) is the 
eighth and last of Coles' Pulitzer Prize-winning "Children of Crisis" series. 
</P>
<P>
His more than 50 books have looked at children caught in the racial struggle; 
children of migrant workers; children and drugs, and children of poverty and 
privilege. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, traveling around the United States and around the world, Coles 
has examined the moral and political lives of children. But the spiritual lives 
of young people came last, the culmination of these three decades of writings. 
</P>
<P>
The medical profession "tends to regard religion with a great deal of 
scrutiny," Coles, 61, explains. "I had to come to terms with that." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, because Coles tends to scrutinize his own profession, his 
willingness to part with medicine's resistance to spirituality is easy to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
Coles boasts that he does not work in a hospital, has never been in private 
practice and has never sent a bill for his medical services. Trained in 
pediatrics and child psychiatry, he describes himself as a maverick physician, 
a rebel who shuns white coat and tie -- one who, for that matter, shuns any 
coat and tie. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he spends most of his time interviewing children and writing about 
them. During his travels, Coles says, he sometimes encounters children who need 
medical attention. He often diagnoses them, and sometimes has seen them to a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Coles took a literary route to medicine. As an undergraduate at Harvard, an 
adviser suggested he take a look at the writings of William Carlos Williams, 
the physician-turned-poet. Coles became so enamored of Williams that he wrote 
his senior thesis about him and sent it to him, and as a result met Williams. 
</P>
<P>
It was 1950, Coles remembered, and "William Carlos Williams was not what he is 
now. He was rebellious. He wasn't tolerated by the literary establishment." 
</P>
<P>
Williams became Coles' model and mentor. The older man took Coles to meet his 
patients in Paterson, N.J. Coles went with Williams from house to house, 
treating children who otherwise could not have afforded medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
Without the influence of Williams, "I probably would have been a high school 
English teacher," Coles said. Instead, he went to Harvard Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
As he began the practice of medicine, Coles continued to turn to Williams for 
guidance. His first book, "Children of Crisis I: A Study of Courage and Fear," 
stemmed from his observations as an Air Force physician in the deep South in 
1960, when the rocky process of school desegregation was under way. Coles 
conducted long conversations with black and white children, and with their 
parents, who were involved in desegregating the schools. 
</P>
<P>
When he began to write up his research, Coles said William Carlos Williams was 
"the one who told me to listen to the children, and to write for the ordinary 
reader." Coles said he still follows Williams' counsel to try "to find the 
poetry in everyday expression." 
</P>
<P>
But this advice flew in the face of "what a traditional psychiatric researcher 
is trained to do," Coles said. "Extract, abstract." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of setting himself up as a traditional child psychiatrist, Coles set 
himself up as a "field worker." He thought he would learn from children by 
learning to talk to them. 
</P>
<P>
"I sit in the kitchen and drink Coca-Colas and draw pictures with them," Coles 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Coles has tried new approaches. He has taught art history to 
fourth-grade students in working-class Lawrence, Mass., and in a public school 
in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
With a laugh he confirms that he also teaches morals and ethics at Harvard -- 
in the medical school, the law school and the business school. "I teach at 
Harvard," Coles said, smiling. "But I also teach elementary school." 
</P>
<P>
Officially, Coles began doing the "Spiritual Life" research in the mid-1980s. 
But when he went back through years of transcripts of interviews with children 
around the world, he found a consistent theme of spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned so much from these children about the way they integrate their 
spiritual lives with their everyday lives -- their academic lives, even their 
athletic lives," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A young Islamic Pakistani boy living in England applied his faith in Allah to 
his desire to become an airline pilot. Asif, nearly 12, said that if he was 
piloting a plane, "I'd know that I'm nearer to Him than I'd be if I wasn't up 
there flying. I'd look at the sky; at night, I'd look at the stars. I'd think 
of Him. He must walk from star to star." 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen-year-old Avram of Brookline, Mass., was preparing for his bar mitzvah 
when Coles talked to him about God. Avram was also studying for two big tests, 
one in math and one in history. The Jewish child told Coles that God "really 
takes an interest in us, and He really hopes for the best -- that our lives 
will work out well. He's not a magician. He gave us our freedom. It's up to us. 
But He didn't walk away after he let us be on our own." 
</P>
<P>
An 8-year-old girl, Connie, whom Coles treated in Boston, stunned him with her 
comfortable spirituality. "I see Jesus smiling when everyone else is looking 
real mean, even me," Connie told Coles. 
</P>
<P>
Coles also learned from the children that, "You don't have to believe in God to 
have a spiritual life. A lot of kids who have been avowedly atheist are quite 
spiritual. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a gray area between moral refraction and spiritual reflection as 
people look for life's purpose," Coles said. "Religion has no monopoly on 
spirituality." 
</P>
<P>
After so many years of studying children, Coles said he can still marvel at the 
way "certain religious and spiritual values work their way into kitchen table 
talk, or advice and punishment." He can still be impressed by "the 
pervasiveness of this in the lives of kids, and the yearnings that families 
have for some kind of spiritual mooring." 
</P>
<P>
This kind of spiritual anchor helps children through crisis, Coles said. There 
was 10-year-old Leah, who saw herself as "a part of Israel" as she lay dying of 
acute leukemia. Natalie, an 8-year-old Hopi girl, was calm about her 
grandmother's impending death because she knew the old woman would travel to 
the mesa, where Natalie believed spirits reside. 
</P>
<P>
"She will leave us for there, and then she'll prepare for us to come there," 
Natalie explained. "I woke up yesterday and realized that I'd been there myself 
(in a dream) to visit her." Natalie said she was pleased that her grandmother 
would be reunited with her own forebears. "They'll be together there, and we'll 
go visit." Natalie said. 
</P>
<P>
Long before their parents may give them credit for it, children seek 
explanations, Coles said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are the creature of language and awareness. We are the creature who 
wants to understand," Coles said. "Children 8 or 9 years old have said to me 
that they know they are a dot in an infinite space." 
</P>
<P>
"That kind of awareness prompts us to try to figure it out, and long before 
they go to high school and take philosophy classes, children ask and wonder and 
reflect about the meaning of life." 
</P>
<P>
They wonder about "the sources of their moral life, the reason for their 
behavior, and what they should do, and why -- and everything else that 
categorizes a human being," Coles said. "Namely, hoping that there is a 
meaning, because I think there is a dark side of us that wonders about 
meaninglessness, too." 
</P>
<P>
Coles said this is the last of his books about the inner lives of children. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired," he said. "I'm 61 years old. I just feel that it would take me 
another eight or 10 years to do another project like this." 
</P>
<P>
And besides, "I just feel that this is a nice way to end 30 years of work." 
</P>
<P>
Coles may be tired of writing about children, but he stressed that he is in no 
way way tired of working with them. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not tired of children," he said. "I'll never be tired of working with 
children." And then a big smile. "I'll never stop working with children."

<P>
Polly pulling Santa's sleigh? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the reindeer are on the road again, spreading Yuletide cheer in shopping 
malls from Virginia to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Early Christmas morning, their year's work done, the last team will return home 
to their reindeer ranch here in central Oregon. Soon afterward, it will be 
antler-shedding season, then a summer at pasture, then breeding season, then 
another Santa season and another command performance impersonating Dasher, 
Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner and Blitzen. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, Rudolph. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, theirs is a two-month annual stint. "There's not much call for them 
in July," says Mike Gillaspie, who with his wife, Cindy, manages "Operation 
Santa Claus." They oversee the care and feeding of a herd of 100-plus reindeer 
on a 20-acre spread a few miles outside this farming community of 7,000, about 
135 miles southeast of Portland. 
</P>
<P>
Mike, a former teacher, laughs and says: "If anybody had told me 10 years ago 
that I'd be reindeer ranching. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
He and Cindy, both 37 and married 10 years, have known each other since second 
grade. They took over management in 1984, but the ranch dates to the early '50s 
when John Zumstein of Redmond brought a small herd of reindeer from Alaska. In 
the '70s, the name, the herd and the property were acquired by Cindy's family. 
</P>
<P>
The Gillaspies' decision to become reindeer caretakers was based partially on 
the lifestyle it promised: a rural setting with real neighbors and more time 
with their daughters, Marisa, 9, and Miranda, 7 1/2. The business is a family 
project, with the girls helping out in the gift shop. They also name the 
reindeer. 
</P>
<P>
No reindeer is ever given one of the names Clement C. Moore made part of the 
American vocabulary with his famous poem that begins " 'Twas the night before 
Christmas." Cindy reasons: "What do you do when Comet dies of old age?" (On the 
road, reindeer assume the stage names of Santa's more famous octet.) 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, the ranch has evolved from a kind of "mom and pop" operation 
that entered animals in local parades to reindeer supplier for such clients as 
Disneyland, the Los Angeles Zoo, films ("Ernest Saves Christmas," for one) and 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
The Gillaspies' lifestyle may encourage togetherness, but it does not provide 
privacy. Home is a ranch-style house on the reindeer ranch, which fronts 
Highway 126, a major east-west artery. Visitors, in the thousands annually, 
seem to think of the Gillaspies as part of the free exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like living in a public park," Cindy says. "They dump their ashtrays, 
dirty diapers and garbage" and peek in on family back-yard barbecues. Until the 
Gillaspies put up a fence, she says, "People would wander through and put their 
kids on our swing set." Passing motorists with car trouble consider them sort 
of a Triple A annex. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, visitors will even ask them to "go catch a couple of deer" so they 
can pose them with their children. No way, Cindy says: "People are so 
sue-happy. They get a foot stepped on, get poked by an antler. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Six teams of five reindeer (four mature animals and a young "Rudolph") are on 
the road now, traveling by truck and horse trailer. Each team is accompanied by 
two handlers who have been working with them since mid-October. All these 
reindeer -- the Rudolphs included -- are females. Mike explains that the bulls 
can be "very aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
Once, he says, "I had a bull get me down and take me for a 45-minute ride. 
About a 350-pounder. I'd slipped on the grass and he was on top of me. . . ." 
Cindy, up at the house, couldn't hear his cries for help. Finally, he was able 
to grab an antler, grab a leg and wiggle away. 
</P>
<P>
He has yet to be gored but "raking" by antlers is common. "No matter what you 
do with reindeer, they're still wild," he says. "The first rule of thumb, if 
you have them in close confines, is don't ever turn your back." 
</P>
<P>
The herd numbers 102 "when everyone's home," as Cindy puts it. It includes a 
rare albino named Snowball that suffers sunburned antlers in summer; breeding 
bulls named Clyde, Rocky, Skippy -- the orneriest of all -- and Bullwinkle, and 
aged animals too arthritic to pull Santa's sleigh. 
</P>
<P>
"You bring Santa. We'll do the rest," is the Operation Santa Claus slogan. 
Clients provide Santa, and the Gillaspies provide the rest, including reindeer, 
feed, handlers, harnesses (properly inscribed "Dancer," "Prancer" and all), 
sleigh and Christmas music. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the teams now on the road will make about 25 stops, most of these at 
shopping malls where children, some curious and some skeptical, come to gawk. 
They want to know, of course, why Rudolph doesn't have a red nose. The trainers 
have answers for the most-asked questions: Rudolph's nose turns red "only on 
foggy Christmas Eves." Santa's reindeer are tethered "so they won't fly away." 
</P>
<P>
Cindy, who is the reindeer booking agent and who also runs the small, on-site 
gift shop that purveys reindeer-abilia such as T-shirts, has had some pretty 
strange requests. She recalls: "Two years ago, some guy in Portland wanted to 
hire a full nine reindeer" -- Santa's traditional team of eight plus a Rudolph. 
He was going to hoist them to his rooftop with a crane, just for Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Money was no object. 
</P>
<P>
Request denied. 
</P>
<P>
What does it cost to rent a team of reindeer? That depends on several factors, 
including how far the animals have to be trucked and whether it's mid-week or a 
weekend. The cost can be "anywhere from $1,000 to $4,000," Cindy says. 
</P>
<P>
As "Mrs. Claus," she greets many of the visitors to the ranch -- and deftly 
fields questions from the youngest. Where's Rudolph? "Well, he's at the North 
Pole. He's special, and Santa wants to keep tabs on him." Is Comet out there? 
Where's Prancer? "Well, they're out on the team so kids in other cities can see 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Cindy makes it a point to be "real vague" in answering kids' questions: 
"There's always something they can trip you up on." If she identifies a certain 
reindeer as Rudolph and a child counters that Rudolph's nose isn't red, Cindy 
may ask, "Why do you think that's so?" Frequently, the youngsters supply the 
best answers, such as, "I think Santa has to give him some special corn." Cindy 
will quickly agree. 
</P>
<P>
Shopping malls represent 90% of the reindeer-renters, but it is a base the 
Gillaspies are trying to diversify to protect themselves from an economic 
downturn. Malls have also been the site of picketing by animal rights 
activists, who have accused the Gillaspies of such things as tranquilizing the 
reindeer and gluing on the antlers. 
</P>
<P>
While dismissing such accusations, the Gillaspies recognize that the activists 
could hurt Operation Santa Claus. "If there are pickets out front (of a mall), 
management gets touchy," Cindy says. 
</P>
<P>
The Gillaspies say they have repeatedly invited the protesters to visit the 
ranch, but they haven't come. Humane considerations aside, Cindy says, "this is 
our livelihood. It would be foolish for us to mistreat our animals." (Reindeer 
are also money on the hoof, perhaps $2,000 for a neutered male, many times that 
for a breeding pair). 
</P>
<P>
As an animal exhibitor, Operation Santa Claus has been licensed and inspected 
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, under the Animal Welfare Act, since 
1979. A USDA spokesman in Sacramento said the agency has never found the 
Gillaspies in violation of its standards for such things as veterinary care and 
sanitation, and that charges by animal rights activists have proven to be 
"unsubstantiated." 
</P>
<P>
Now, everything you've always wanted to know about reindeer: 
</P>
<P>
* Antlers: Both males and females grow antlers, which fall off at their base in 
the winter. Mike says: "They just start beating them on the fence, and they'll 
pop right off." By June, they'll have grown back fully. "I swear you can watch 
them grow," he says. 
</P>
<P>
A full rack of antlers may weigh as much as 60 pounds and branch out in all 
directions, as much as four feet wide and five feet high. 
</P>
<P>
The reindeer wear them like crowns. "They know exactly how far they have to dip 
and turn. It's like with cats' whiskers," Cindy says. Most of the discarded 
antlers are sold to people who make chandeliers and chess pieces. 
</P>
<P>
* Group dynamics: Reindeer are herd animals. "You get one going," Mike says, 
"and the rest will follow." Separated from the herd, an animal will bark-grunt 
in distress. 
</P>
<P>
* Life expectancy: In captivity, a reindeer can live 16 to 18 years, longer 
than in the wild. Fall is breeding season, when the Gillaspies selectively 
breed about 25 females to encourage such qualities as gentleness and short 
noses (as opposed to the longer face of the caribou, to which the reindeer is 
closely related). 
</P>
<P>
* Reproduction: After a gestation period of seven months and one week, a 
reindeer typically gives birth to a single calf, weighing eight to 10 pounds, 
with a dark coat and long legs that go every which way. 
</P>
<P>
At about three weeks of age, they begin to grow antlers. The calves grow 
quickly and by late summer will weigh 100 or more pounds. 
</P>
<P>
* Diet: At Operation Santa Claus, the reindeer diet is a specially prepared, 
high-protein formula trucked in from Portland 12 tons at a time. Each animal 
eats two to three pounds of pellets, which resemble rabbit food, each day. 
</P>
<P>
Although generations of children have left carrots for Santa's reindeer along 
with cookies and milk for Santa, the truth is reindeer don't eat carrots, Mike 
says. 
</P>
<P>
* Apparell: Reindeer will thrive in mild climates, but their coats are made up 
of hollow hairs that provide insulation from the harshest weather. In the 
summer, when they spend lazy days at Operation Santa Claus munching grass hay 
and anything else that's around to nibble, their summer coats are sleek and 
dark, and they don't look like real reindeer. 
</P>
<P>
* Training: Those adorable reindeer, with their with limpid brown eyes, that 
bring Santa to malls with bells on their harnesses a-jingle aren't just doing 
what comes naturally. At about five months of age, the calves are introduced to 
a tether and broken to a lead, then come the harness and bells. Around two 
years of age, they are broken to a sleigh. 
</P>
<P>
* Reindeer couch potatoes: Not all reindeer wish to be Santa's helpers. Mike, 
nodding toward the pasture, says: "There are animals out there that just sit 
and do nothing. We feed them."

Out of the Shadows: British novelist Salman Rushdie says he wants to "wake up 
from the nightmare" of his life in hiding, so he was a guest on a radio program 
in London Monday, one day after an Iranian minister said his death sentence 
must stand. "Here's a tiny inch forward," he said of his appearance. "There may 
well be two steps back." He has been in hiding for nearly two years since 
Iran's late spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called his novel "The 
Satanic Verses" a blasphemy against Islam and ordered Muslims to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
* First-Timer: Media magnate Ted Turner and activist-actress Jane Fonda will be 
married about a year from now. Turner himself confirmed it recently in Atlanta 
at a private reception. Fonda flashed her engagement ring and said: "I've been 
married twice, but I never had one before." 
</P>
<P>
* Belated Bash: After 100 years, reclusive poet Emily Dickinson got the book 
party she never had -- and the kind of attention she might have hated. "I guess 
we're safe in doing it at this time," said organizer Martha Ackmann of Monday's 
celebration at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass., which marked the 
publication of the bulk of Dickinson's poetry in 1890 -- four years after her 
death. The poet might have deplored all the fuss at her alma mater, but Ackmann 
likes an old college try: "We kind of think of it as the publication party 
Mount Holyoke never gave her." 
</P>
<P>
* Two-Timer: A Marine married his sweetheart in Lolo, Mont., over the weekend 
-- even though he was thousands of miles away in the Persian Gulf. Sgt. Paul 
Flemmer married Rhonda McWilliams when Flemmer's father, Del Flemmer, stood in 
for his eldest son under the Montana provision that permits proxy weddings. 
Flemmer had a military leave to get married Aug. 30, but it was canceled after 
Iraq invaded Kuwait and Flemmer had to ship out. The bride says the couple will 
"do it the right way" when Flemmer gets back.

FUNDING OF 'RISKY' WORKS A MUST, STUDY SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: REPORT IS THE PRODUCT OF A MEETING TO ASSESS THE DAMAGE DONE TO THE 
NATION'S ARTS INSTITUTIONS BY THE FRACTIOUS NEA BATTLE THAT BEGAN IN APRIL OF 
LAST YEAR.

Government arts programs should make a point of supporting experimental and 
controversial work and the National Endowment for the Arts has a "specially 
compelling responsibility" to protect freedom of artistic expression, a new 
private arts agency report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
However, an official of the American Assembly -- the Columbia 
University-affiliated public policy think tank that is to release the report 
this morning -- said the NEA political crisis of the last 18 months has raised 
questions about whether the federal arts agency has forcefully played the role 
of arts freedom protector. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Benedict, project director of the American Assembly study, said that 
"the question remains open" whether the arts endowment has been taking a policy 
direction opposite from the one urged on it by the new report. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a lot of concern," Benedict said of fears that the NEA may 
fail to resume its leadership role in the arts in the wake of new legislation 
passed just before Congress adjourned. "Some people in the arts would say the 
first signs are not good," Benedict said. 
</P>
<P>
But the report lays blame far more widely than simply with the arts endowment. 
It reserves some of its most potent criticism for the nation's arts community, 
which, the assembly asserts, "was not prepared to compete on equal terms with 
its adversaries." 
</P>
<P>
The nation's artists and arts institutions did major damage to their own cause 
by failing to develop a unified political strategy and allowing their 
collective effectiveness to be dissipated in petty turf disputes. 
</P>
<P>
"Arts advocacy can only succeed if all participants in the process refrain from 
asserting their interests at the expense of others," the report concludes. 
"Fractures occurred in the arts community itself." 
</P>
<P>
The report is the product of a three-day meeting last month at which more than 
75 government arts officials, artists, arts patrons and businessmen met to 
assess the damage done to the nation's arts institutions by the fractious NEA 
battle that began in April of last year and to try to plot a course for more 
successful political action in the future. 
</P>
<P>
But CalArts president Steven D. Lavine, co-organizer with Benedict of the 
conference, said he came away concerned that political damage to the NEA may 
already have been so great that the agency could be perceived as expendable in 
a Congress preoccupied with deficit reduction and a generalized deterioration 
of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably won't happen in the next 12 months," Lavine said. "But we could 
see the whole agency lost not as some kind of policy decision, but simply as a 
last-minute compromise. We could be sacrificed to some kind of political 
expediency at four in the morning," Lavine said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, newly obtained correspondence from a key congressman to NEA 
chairman John E. Frohnmayer appears to underscore questions over the 
effectiveness of Frohnmayer's arts advocacy role and the precariousness of the 
NEA's political position in Washington. Frohnmayer attended the American 
Assembly meeting, which was held in Harriman, N.Y., Nov. 8-11. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, from Rep. Paul Henry (R-Mich.), surfaces as the NEA's advisory 
National Council on the Arts prepares to convene a two-day emergency meeting to 
try to resolve questions about how to put into effect a new law regulating the 
NEA's operations. 
</P>
<P>
A key discussion point will be how the NEA will comply with wording inserted 
into the new law at Henry's behest that exhorts the arts endowment to observe 
"general standards of decency" and respect traditional American values in 
deciding what arts projects will receive government funds. 
</P>
<P>
Henry's letter to Frohnmayer, dated Nov. 7 but whose existence did not become 
known until last week, castigates the NEA chairman for remarks he made in an 
interview with The Times in which he said the so-called decency wording in the 
new arts endowment law could be handled in a way that had a "benign" effect on 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very concerned" about the arts endowment chairman's remarks. "Such an 
attitude would be a direct breach of faith with those of us 'in the middle' who 
have gone out of our way to try to save and strengthen the endowment over the 
past two years," Henry wrote to Frohnmayer. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Henry said the congressman and Frohnmayer talked by telephone 
after the letter was sent and that Henry was reassured by the NEA chairman's 
assertions that he intended the word "benign" to mean that the decency clause 
would have "beneficial" effects. 
</P>
<P>
The American Assembly report concluded that, while support of the arts by 
governmental agencies at all levels is appropriate, the NEA -- as the lead 
federal arts organization -- must take an uncompromising position on issues of 
freedom of speech and artistic expression. 
</P>
<P>
"Constitutional principles of freedom of expression, essential to a democratic 
society, are of special importance to a thriving artistic climate," the 
American Assembly concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Government, the report asserted, should make a special effort to single out for 
support art that may be "risky or unpopular." "Some art has always been 
controversial and will continue to be," the assembly concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the report's conclusions about divisions within the arts 
community, however, the American Assembly also recommended that a group of 
corporate chief executives should be formed to act as a new arts-advocacy group 
nationwide, attempting to influence arts agencies at all levels of government. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which grew out of a suggestion by New York publisher Arthur 
Levitt, was attacked by artists, however, who contended that such a 
businessman's group might be willing to sacrifice the needs of practicing 
artists and cutting edge art groups to preserve funding for the large arts 
institutions on whose boards corporate chief executives tend to sit.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'SIMPSONS' SEEK SAFETY AND NUMBERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
I love "The Simpsons," but. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This marketing cult of Bart and family -- from the fast-food tie-ins to the toy 
line that Mattel is hawking for Christmas to the ever-present T-shirts to the 
just-released, airwaves-flooding, impossible-to-miss "Do the Bartman" video -- 
is really starting to grate. 
</P>
<P>
Now don't have a cow, man. 
</P>
<P>
It's encouraging to see genius and creativity rewarded with profits, and all of 
the products are real cute and, as a bonus, don't promote mass destruction. 
Moreover, "The Simpsons" is not the first supremely innovative cartoon, whether 
originating in print or on TV, to become a virtual industry that rolls out 
lucrative commercial spinoffs by conveyor belt. 
</P>
<P>
Check out "Peanuts," for example. And I should point out that the coffee mug I 
filled this morning bore a panel from "The Far Side" showing a family and dog 
positioned in front of a blank wall poised for something great, the father in 
an easy chair, the kids on the floor with their heads resting on their hands. 
The caption: "In the days before television." 
</P>
<P>
In the days before its marketing success spilled onto the shelves of video and 
other retail stores, however, "The Simpsons" did indeed seem funnier. All of 
this exposure, including Fox's moving "The Simpsons" to an 8 p.m. Thursday time 
slot opposite NBC's 800-pound Godzilla, "The Cosby Show," almost seems to have 
given "The Simpsons" an unbecoming aura of slickness and sleekness. As a 
result, the series seems less special. 
</P>
<P>
A peculiar charm of "The Simpsons" has always been its ability to walk a fine 
line between underground and over-the-counter by not allowing the glitter of 
commercialism to eclipse its subculture scruffiness. This gave it a unique 
luster. But now it's the marketing side that seems to loom largest. 
</P>
<P>
The question of whether success spoils is an old one, and no one is yet 
ascribing spoilage to "The Simpsons." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the two other Fox series that have found relative success in the ratings 
-- the uneven "Married . . . With Children" and the increasingly unfunny "In 
Living Color" -- "The Simpsons" has a shot at greatness. There is still 
probably more truth about families in "The Simpsons" than in any other series 
in prime time, for example. And last week's episode, with Homer barely 
surviving Bart's efforts to be a daredevil by jumping Springfield Gorge on a 
skateboard, was fairly funny. 
</P>
<P>
But this week's squishy one, a repeat of the fall premiere in which Bart almost 
flunks out of school, is more typical of this season. "The Simpsons" -- whose 
ratings are solid but still significantly beneath those of "The Cosby Show" -- 
has gotten softer as the marketing of its characters outside the series has 
expanded. 
</P>
<P>
And will softer now lead to safer? 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that the series has been guilty of "cheap shots," co-executive 
producer Sam Simon has said that "The Simpsons" next season will moderate its 
jokes about the nuclear industry. This follows criticism of the series by one 
nuclear-industry group and a subsequent tour of the San Onofre nuclear plant in 
San Clemente for Simon and some of his Fox colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"The Simpsons" guilty of cheap shots? 
</P>
<P>
Guilty and proud of it, one would think. 
</P>
<P>
Homer, whose hapless employment at an unsafe, pollution-spewing nuclear plant 
has been comic nourishment for some episodes, is the biggest cheap shot of all, 
a gross exaggeration and below-the-belt attack on fathers and parenting 
everywhere. Just about every aspect of Homer is exquisitely unfair, and three 
cheers for it. 
</P>
<P>
Leave heartwarming to the herd. Cheap shots are "The Simpsons' " best shots, 
the cheaper the better. In this case, meanness is an attribute, and the series 
is especially good when being nasty toward the Establishment, whether education 
mills or the church or the nuclear industry. Yet . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"No more three-eyed fish," Simon has now mandated, referring to a recent 
episode in which pollution from the nuclear plant where Homer works created a 
mutant fish in a nearby stream. 
</P>
<P>
So what's wrong with mutants? "The Simpsons" and its characters are themselves 
mutants in the very best sense. While Fox and the show's executives are doing 
the Bartman all the way to the bank, too much warmth may be ruining just about 
the only three-eyed fish in TV's mainstream.

Mahikari of America -- A Dec. 6 article incorrectly characterized a dojo at the 
Mahikari religious organization's former center in Tujunga as a martial arts

<P>
Narcotics agents and police raided an active drug lab capable of producing at 
least $1 million worth of crystal methamphetamine, or "ice," and arrested four 
Korean gang members, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the state Bureau of 
Narcotics Enforcement and Los Angeles police raided a North Hollywood apartment 
about 7:35 p.m. Tuesday, DEA spokesman Ralph Lochridge said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers arrested four adults described as Korean gang members, Lochridge 
said. Their identities were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
The potent smokable form of methamphetamine, worth about $100,000 per pound on 
the street, is in great demand in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Lochridge said the North Hollywood raid was the first documented case of "ice" 
manufacturing by Koreans in Los Angeles for distribution in Hawaii.

A series of medium-size tremors may presage big quakes in California, and the 
telltale pattern might be used to improve predictions of when devastating 
quakes will strike, scientists said today. 
</P>
<P>
A historical study of tremor activity surrounding the major San Francisco Bay 
quakes of 1868, 1906 and 1989 found the number of moderate earthquakes 
increased rapidly on nearby faults one to two decades before the serious 
quakes. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1868 and 1906 quakes struck, seismic activity dropped off sharply and 
there were relatively few quakes for periods of 13 years and 42 years, 
respectively, the study showed. 
</P>
<P>
A comparable pattern was also found for the sizable 1948 shock on the San 
Andreas Fault in Southern California, Lynn Sykes and Steven Jaume wrote in 
their study published in the journal Nature.

BRAZIL RANCHER ADMITS KILLING AMAZON ACTIVIST 
</P>

XAPURI, Brazil 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brazilian rancher Darci Alves da Silva, in a dramatic and unexpected 
about-face, confessed in court today that he had shot dead rain forest activist 
Chico Mendes nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Darci, accused with his father, Darly, of the murder -- which drew worldwide 
attention to the destruction of the Amazon rain forest -- had said they were 
innocent. But on taking the witness stand hours after the trial opened, Darci 
changed his plea: "I killed Chico Mendes," he confessed, adding that he had 
acted alone. 
</P>
<P>
"I fired one shot," Darci, dressed neatly in a white shirt and beige trousers, 
told the tiny, cramped courtroom in the Amazon village of Xapuri. 
</P>
<P>
His voice betrayed no hint of emotion as he spoke of the night of Dec. 22, 
1988, when he crouched in Mendes' back yard, ambushing the rubber tappers' 
leader as he emerged from his simple wooden house and firing one bullet into 
his chest. 
</P>
<P>
Federal Police Chief Romeu Tuma, in Xapuri for the trial, told reporters that 
Darci's confession could be a tactic to try to get his father Darly, accused of 
ordering the murder, acquitted. Darci might also be trying to persuade the 
court that no one else was involved in the crime, Tuma added. 
</P>
<P>
Darci turned himself over to police within days of the killing of Mendes and 
confessed to the murder. He later retracted his confession, so today's 
admission was a stunning development. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign reporters and environmentalists were crammed in the tiny, 80-seat 
courtroom while townspeople stood outside in driving rain. White banners in the 
main square of this frontier town proclaimed "Justice to Save Amazon." 
</P>
<P>
Mendes was a local trade unionist who led rubber tappers in their struggle 
against the encroachment of cattlemen into the world's last great rain forest. 
Mendes' campaign made him enemies among the ranchers, and he predicted his own 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Security in Xapuri, a town of 5,000 people in the western state of Acre close 
to Bolivia, is intense. Police check everyone who enters the town. 
</P>
<P>
The tightest security has surrounded the main prosecution witness, 15-year-old 
Genesio da Silva, who has lived in hiding since 1989. Genesio da Silva, who 
used to live on Darly Alves da Silva's farm, is due to testify that he heard 
him plotting the murder. 
</P>
<P>
Human rights activists said the trial of Alves da Silva on charges of ordering 
the murder was virtually unprecedented in Brazil. Moacyr Grechi, the Roman 
Catholic bishop in Acre's state capital, Rio Branco, said that out of 1,200 
rural murders in Brazil between 1964 to 1986, no one was ever brought to trial 
for ordering a killing. 
</P>
<P>
But those close to Mendes question whether the right man is in the dock. They 
say Alves da Silva is a small fish in a large conspiracy that involved far more 
powerful people.

About 50,000 Albanians founded their country's first independent political 
party today, a day after Communist rulers said they are ready for a multi-party 
system, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
They said students, workers and intellectuals gathered peacefully on the campus 
of Tirana University for a founding rally of the new "Democratic Party" in 
Europe's final bastion of Marxist orthodoxy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an immense achievement on the road to democracy," Sali Berisha, a 
45-year-old heart specialist and founding member, told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The witnesses, speaking by telephone from Tirana, said speakers told the rally 
that the new party will apply for registration with Albania's Justice Ministry 
and plans to field candidates in next February's parliamentary elections.

CAVAZOS, U.S. CABINET'S 1ST LATINO, QUITS

<P>
Lauro F. Cavazos, the first Latino ever appointed to the Cabinet, resigned 
today as secretary of education. 
</P>
<P>
He is the second member of President Bush's Cabinet to depart in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reason given for Cavazos' decision to resign, and the 
resignation letter did not say what Cavazos plans to do. 
</P>
<P>
Adminstration sources said Cavazos had tired of criticism aimed at his 
performance behind the scenes by White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu. His 
critics had faulted the education chief as an inadequate salesman for the 
Administration's policies, who never mastered television skills. 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos, 63, has led the Department of Education since 1988. He was appointed 
by former President Ronald Reagan and held over in the job by Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in a letter accepting Cavazos' resignation, said: "For more than two 
years, and under two Presidents, you have distinguished yourself through your 
devotion to improving the education of our nation's children." 
</P>
<P>
Bush mentioned the Cavazos resignation in passing during a speech on education 
today before a group called Jobs for America's Graduates. Calling Cavazos "my 
dear friend," Bush cited his contributions to setting national education goals 
and said, "I think the country will always be very, very grateful to him for 
his service to country." 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Education said Ted Sanders, now the deputy secretary of 
education and former Illinois schools chief, will serve as acting secretary 
upon Cavazos' departure. 
</P>
<P>
Cavazos, in his own letter, said he is stepping down effective Dec. 15.

John Gotti, the "Teflon Don" mob boss whom authorities can't seem to convict, 
was indicted today on charges of ordering the slaying of Gambino crime family 
chief Paul Castellano and three other killings. 
</P>
<P>
Castellano's slaying catapulted Gotti to power in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment also charged Gotti with loansharking, gambling, tax evasion and 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
The dapper Gotti, 50, as usual impeccably dressed, was arrested Tuesday night 
with three associates at a social club in Manhattan's Little Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time we've taken down the entire hierarchy of an organized 
crime family," said James Fox, head of the FBI office in New York.

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and MCI Communications Corp. said today 
they had reached an out-of-court settlement on lawsuits and countersuits that 
had alleged theft of customers and false advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, the two companies agreed to propose adoption by the 
Federal Communications Commission of industrywide standards to protect 
consumers from being switched to other long-distance companies against their 
will. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed standards would permit long-distance carriers to switch a 
customer's service only by one of the following means: 
</P>
<P>
* A customer-initiated call to an 800 number of the carrier to which the 
customer is switching. 
</P>
<P>
* Independent third-party confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
* Signed letter of authorization. 
</P>
<P>
* A call placed by the customer to their local or long-distance telephone 
company. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies, along with US Sprint, have been locked in a fierce battle 
for customers. AT&amp;T and MCI, or their agents, have been placing calls to 
millions of phone users each month trying to get them to switch their 
long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal authorities and local phone companies have received tens of 
thousands of complaints about unauthorized switching. 
</P>
<P>
Since the breakup of the old Bell System in 1984, AT&amp;T's share of the 
long-distance market has eroded to below 70%. MCI, the nation's second-largest 
long-distance carrier, now has about 15% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T, which had claimed that it was losing customers because of 
unauthorized switching by MCI and its telemarketing agent, had asked the FCC to 
require a customer's written authorization before a change could be made.

FIRM LEAVES WYO.-CALIF. PIPELINE TO COMPETITOR

Coastal Corp. has scrapped plans for a $600-million pipeline that would have 
carried natural gas from Wyoming to oil producers and utilities in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal Chairman Oscar Wyatt Jr. said at the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries meeting in Vienna on Tuesday that the WyCal project was 
abandoned because of fears of an economic slowdown and tough competition from a 
nearly identical pipeline proposed by a subsidiary of Tenneco Inc. "They simply 
outdistanced us on this one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal spent more than $150 million on pipe, compressors and right of way. The 
company should lose no more than $8 million to $10 million on the scrapped 
venture because it can sell the pipe and other equipment or use it on another 
Coastal project, Wyatt said. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal and Tenneco had stuck by plans for the parallel pipelines for the last 
year, despite analysts' claims that the market for gas in California was not 
big enough to support both projects. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies fought for approval from federal regulators, lined up customers 
and insisted construction would begin this month. But Tenneco's larger project 
and firm customer contracts apparently doomed WyCal. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that from a business standpoint, Coastal just didn't feel like it 
had the nod," said Carol Freedenthal, a Houston natural gas consultant. 
"Reality set in and they said, 'Wait a minute, we've got a problem.' "

A Boeing Co. plan for handling alcohol and other drug abuse has been 
implemented over vehement objections by the aerospace giant's largest union. 
</P>
<P>
Under the policy put into effect Tuesday, Boeing's nearly 150,000 U.S. 
employees, from janitors to executives, may be tested after on-the-job 
accidents or when company officials find a reasonable suspicion that an 
employee used drugs.

Employees found to have prohibited substances in their system could enter a 
treatment program after the first offense but would face dismissal for a second 
offense.

Eighty-six percent of the members of the International Assn. of Machinists and 
Aerospace Workers, which represents about 40,000 Boeing workers in and around 
Seattle and another 10,000 in Portland, Ore., and Wichita, Kan., voted last 
month to reject the plan.

Left-hander Floyd Bannister, a 13-year major league veteran who pitched in 
Japan last season, agreed today to a $250,000 contract with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister, 35, was 3-2 with a 4.04 ERA for the Yakult Swallows of Japan's 
Central League. 
</P>
<P>
He pitched only 49 innings, walking 22 and striking out 31, and left the 
Swallows midway through the season because his contract expired and he refused 
to accept a month-to-month offer. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his base with the Angels, Bannister would get a $450,000 bonus 
if he makes the Angels' opening day roster. Additional performance bonuses 
could boost his 1991 income to $1.15 million. The Angels have options for 1992 
at $1.3 million and 1993 at $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a little bit of interest (from other teams), but Floyd had 
ear-marked the California Angels as the place he wanted to be," said 
Bannister's agent, Chris Arnold. "His in-laws are from the Anaheim area." 
</P>
<P>
Bannister appeared in only 14 games for the Kansas City Royals in 1989 before 
he injured his left shoulder. He was 4-1 with a 4.66 ERA in 14 games and made 
$850,000. In 1988, his first year with the Royals, he was 12-13 with a 4.33 
ERA. 
</P>
<P>
After an outstanding career at Arizona State, Bannister was taken by Houston as 
the first player selected in the June 1976 amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
He began his major league career with the Astros in 1977 and played for 
Seattle, the Chicago White Sox and Kansas City. He has a career record of 
133-142 and a 4.03 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister had his best year in 1983 with the White Sox, when he was 16-10 with 
a 3.35 ERA and 193 strikeouts. In 1982, he pitched for Seattle and led the 
American League with 209 strikeouts.

Rival black leaders appealed today for an end to fighting that has claimed at 
least 83 lives in five days, but declined to meet each other as they toured 
Tokoza to call for peace. 
</P>
<P>
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and Zulu leader Chief 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi separately toured different parts of Tokoza to urge 
followers to end fighting that has shattered the black township. 
</P>
<P>
But neither leader accepted invitations from the other to join their tours. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of heavily armed soldiers and police in armored vehicles ringed the 
township east of Johannesburg and lined the streets to ensure there was no 
violence. Police said they had no reports of incidents today after savage 
fighting Tuesday claimed at least 52 lives. 
</P>
<P>
Black factional fighting in the Johannesburg area has claimed at least 1,000 
lives since August. The fighting pits Xhosas and other blacks loyal to the ANC 
against Zulus tied to Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party. 
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi, accompanied by Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, told about 3,000 
Zulus armed with spears, knives and axes that there should be an end to 
violence. But he struck a defiant note, saying his followers had the right to 
self-defense.

Tony Meola, whose goalkeeping helped the United States advance to soccer's 
World Cup finals earlier this year, is moving from England to France. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Soccer Federation requested that Meola be released when his work 
permit in England expired at the end of November. He had joined Watford after 
the World Cup but did not get the playing time he had hoped for. Meola has 
begun working out with Toulouse F.C., and a USSF official said the federation 
"expects to announce that Tony will be with another professional club."

Washington State has been reprimanded by the Pacific-10 Conference for NCAA 
rules violations in its men's basketball program, Commissioner Thomas C. Hansen 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
The violations, announced Tuesday, involved a credit arrangement under which 
two players purchased airline tickets. The public reprimand does not carry any 
probation or sanction. 
</P>
<P>
"Officials at Washington State were both thorough and cooperative in 
researching the facts of the case once the possibility of violations had 
occurred," Hansen said.

Trainer Mohammed Moubarak was fined a record $15,600 today by British racing 
authorities who said six of his thoroughbreds were given anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
The Jockey Club said it believes that the drugs were administered by assistant 
trainer Ahmed Kobeissi without Moubarak's knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for Moubarak said Kobeissi acquired a medication called Equipoise from 
the United States, believing it to be a harmless "pick-me-up," and injected 
horses with it in April. 
</P>
<P>
"Colleagues in America told him everyone there used it and that it was 
perfectly legal," lawyer Matthew McCloy told the Jockey Club's disciplinary 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
Post-race urine tests between May and July found the six Moubarak horses to 
contain boldenone, a synthetic anabolic steroid. 
</P>
<P>
The Jockey Club also fined Kobeissi $3,900 and barred him for a year.

John McEnroe, the tennis world's notorious bad boy, apparently got as upset at 
missing a connecting flight to Hawaii today as he does at missing a serve. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe and his party, flying from Los Angeles, missed United Flight 31 from 
San Francisco to Kona, airline spokeswoman Sara Dornacker said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the flight was held several minutes to wait for McEnroe and his four 
traveling companions, whom she declined to name. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe had some words with two agents at the gate to Flight 31, and some 
touching or bumping apparently ensued on both sides, airport police Sgt. Gary 
O'Donnell said, adding that McEnroe was traveling with his wife, actress Tatum 
O'Neil, their two children and a nanny. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe and the agents were escorted to the airport police station, but after 
about 45 minutes it was evident that neither side wanted to pursue the 
incident, O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
Dornacker refused to characterize the incident or confirm that any pushing or 
shoving occurred. She said, however, that the airline "has not signed any 
complaint or pressed any charges in this matter, and we do not intend to." 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe was booked on another United flight to Hawaii later in the day, she 
said.

Romance-mystery "Ghost," an unlikely hit in a year peppered with 
action-adventure films, has passed the $200-million mark in box-office sales, 
Paramount Pictures said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Ghost," which was released in July, has become the 11th-highest grossing film 
of all time at the domestic box office. As of Monday, its ticket sales had 
totaled $200,034,574. 
</P>
<P>
"Ghost," which stars Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze, led the weekly box office 
four different times in its 22 weeks of release and never finished lower than 
eighth in weekly rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Another romance, Disney's "Pretty Woman," was the second-biggest film this 
year, with $178.4 million in 36 weeks of release. New Line's "Teenage Mutant 
Ninja Turtles" was third at $133.1 million.

Two handwritten letters between Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud discussing 
the nature of war sold for $165,000, and a Louis Armstrong trumpet drew $16,500 
at the same auction. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange of letters was initiated by a League of Nations official for a 
limited-edition book published in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
The letters, which were sold Tuesday by Sotheby's, were consigned by an 
educational institution and purchased by a private American buyer, said Matthew 
Weigman, a Sotheby's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Einstein's four-page letter of July 28, 1932, asks, "Is there a way to liberate 
man from the doom of war?" The 14-page reply from Freud concludes, "There is no 
prospect of getting rid of this aggressive instinct." 
</P>
<P>
Another private American buyer bought the trumpet and a manuscript essay on the 
musician's recollections on the development of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
The B-flat trumpet sold for $16,500 and the handwritten essay for $27,500, 
Weigman said.
