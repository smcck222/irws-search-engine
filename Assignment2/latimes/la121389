SALVADOR SEEKS TO QUELL LIBERAL CHURCH NETWORK

<P>
With raids, arrests and expulsions, the Salvadoran government and its security 
forces have embarked on a campaign to dismantle a liberal church network that 
the authorities think is supporting leftist rebels. 
</P>
<P>
The crackdown comes in response to the largest rebel offensive in 10 years of 
civil war. Targets include priests, lay workers and foreign employees of 
humanitarian agencies, whom the government accuses of supporting revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-backed government denies that it is persecuting the church, but Yvonne 
Dilling, a representative of the U.S. National Council of Churches who traveled 
to San Salvador last month to investigate the problem, said, "The work of the 
church has been closed down, paralyzed, destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
As a result of raids by state security forces at the St. John Evangelist 
Episcopal Church in San Salvador, most of the church's leadership has been 
jailed. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen Lutheran Church lay workers, among them four Americans and a Salvadoran 
who heads the church's legal aid office, were detained by the National Guard 
and later released. Posters advertising a peace march were confiscated. The 
foreigners were expelled. The bishop of the church left the country after his 
life was threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers shot at the feet of a Spanish-born priest protecting a group of war 
refugees at St. Mary of the Poor, a Roman Catholic church in a slum district of 
the capital. A few days later, the priest fled to Spain. 
</P>
<P>
At Christ the Savior, a church associated with leftist causes in the poor 
neighborhood of Zacamil, uniformed gunmen ransacked offices, sprayed the 
sanctuary with gunfire, scattered Communion wafers on the ground and stole the 
cross. 
</P>
<P>
Government and military officials say they are trying to break up "front 
organizations" that have operated under a veil of legality while funneling 
money and support to rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front 
(FMLN). 
</P>
<P>
But the church workers say they are pastors to the poor -- whoever the poor 
might be and whatever side they might be on. Church leaders often advocate 
sweeping social change, and the Establishment regards this as subversive. 
</P>
<P>
People involved in the humanitarian work fear that the government crackdown 
will cripple a wide range of social service projects -- food programs, health 
care, relief for the displaced -- that churches and other groups sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
Already, San Salvador's Baptist Church has suspended a literacy program, and a 
Los Angeles-based medical aid organization has closed its office after it was 
ransacked by soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
According to human rights organizations, soldiers have carried out more than 50 
raids on churches, residences and church-sponsored refugee centers. Of the 79 
foreign missionaries and lay church workers in El Salvador last month, 31 have 
fled the country, among them at least eight Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Luis Serrano, head of the Episcopal Church here, was arrested late 
last month, along with 17 lay workers, and ordered held for trial. He and eight 
other church workers have been implicated in a guerrilla attack on military 
headquarters because two trucks loaded with weapons were reportedly seen 
leaving the church. 
</P>
<P>
The military is especially suspicious of the role and influence of what they 
consider to be pro-rebel foreigners in church and humanitarian work. Flyers 
bearing the air force seal and dropped from the air in recent days have advised 
"patriotic Salvadorans" of their "legitimate right" to kill "FMLN terrorists 
and their internationalist allies." 
</P>
<P>
American church worker Jennifer Jean Casolo was arrested Nov. 25 and charged 
with storing weapons for the rebels on the grounds of her residence. Casolo 
says she is innocent, and friends say she was framed to discredit church work. 
Her Salvadoran lawyer received five death threats by telephone the day he took 
her case, and a bullet was slipped under the door of an American churchman who 
went to visit her. 
</P>
<P>
Several international relief agencies have felt the pressure, including U.N. 
refugee and children's programs, which relocated to Guatemala after soldiers 
occupied their offices in San Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III sent a two-paragraph letter this 
week to President Alfredo Cristiani expressing concern about religious and 
humanitarian workers in El Salvador and asking the leader to give his personal 
attention to their welfare. 
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. Ambassador William Walker, who maintains that the church is not 
being persecuted in El Salvador, has said he understands the motives behind the 
government crackdown. He compares the arrest of foreign missionaries to the 
internment of Japanese in the United States at the start of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"In the heat after the attack on Pearl Harbor . . . there was a lot of emotion 
and anger flowing," Walker said. "We are in a situation in which a city is 
under attack by some very vicious, well-armed people. Given that circumstance, 
this (raids and arrests) happens." 
</P>
<P>
Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, chief of staff of the Salvadoran armed forces, said his 
troops are using "good intelligence" to weed out rebel collaborators believed 
to be hiding under the cloak of church activity. 
</P>
<P>
"The armed forces," he said, "are not persecuting the church as an institution. 
We are reacting to information that our intelligence supplies us. There are 
members of the church who have certain identification with and have given 
support to the FMLN." 
</P>
<P>
But religious leaders are alarmed by the innuendo and unproven charges used to 
link them to the insurrection. 
</P>
<P>
Msgr. Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of San Salvador, said in a recent 
Sunday homily that the military campaign of "unjust accusations" against the 
church "touches the limits of true persecution." 
</P>
<P>
"In this climate," he said, "many abuses are committed, not only against 
personnel of the Catholic Church, but also against many people who care about 
helping the most humble and the most poor." 
</P>
<P>
The sins of a few, he said, are being used to blame the many. 
</P>
<P>
President Cristiani has said that although the majority of church groups are 
engaged in legitimate relief work, there are exceptions that warrant 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, government and military leaders have attributed the rebel 
insurgency to the decision of many Catholic priests to help the poor better 
their lives -- a decision that conflicts with longstanding social and economic 
structures that concentrate El Salvador's wealth in relatively few hands. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, a handful of young Jesuit seminarians took up arms and joined the 
rebels. Currently, three priests -- two of them foreigners -- travel with the 
rebels, though they insist that their work is pastoral and that they do not 
carry weapons. 
</P>
<P>
With last month's urban guerrilla offensive, many churches found themselves 
caught in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Several were seized by the guerrillas when the offensive started Nov. 11, then 
retaken by the army. Other churches were drawn into the conflict when they gave 
medical treatment to wounded people who in some cases were rebels, or shelter 
to groups of refugees that the army suspected included guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
In Cuscatancingo, a poor neighborhood north of San Salvador, a Catholic church 
literally became the battlefield. Guerrillas seized the church at the start of 
the offensive and from there attacked a nearby army barracks. The army fought 
to regain control and drove the rebels from the area. 
</P>
<P>
The sanctuary was so damaged by gunfire that priests removed the statues of 
Jesus, Mary and the saints, and a Mass said there Dec. 3 by Archbishop Arturo 
Rivera y Damas was held on the church patio. Soldiers have been camped on the 
church's grounds for more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers also raided the offices of Emmanuel Baptist Church and the Mennonite 
Central Committee, and one Catholic Church was searched six times. 
</P>
<P>
The intruders at Christ the Savior in Zacamil left a sign that warned: "Do Not 
Enter. Mine Field." That kept worshipers away for a week. 
</P>
<P>
The history of Christ the Savior Church -- it has produced two of the priests 
who work alongside the guerrillas -- and some of its members' pro-FMLN 
sympathies made it an obvious target for the military. At least one parishioner 
is believed to have fought with the rebels in the latest offensive. 
</P>
<P>
But the church's plight is also an example of how grass-roots missionary work, 
such as organizing poor people to improve their lives, can open a parish to 
suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
"The army has always seen this parish as a center of subversion," said Father 
William Schmidt, a Maryknoll priest from Long Island, N.Y. "We try to relate 
the Scripture to what is really happening in the country." 
</P>
<P>
After the Christ the Savior Church was searched and ransacked, two parishioners 
reported that their homes, too, had been raided. Soldiers forced one to use his 
truck to cart off a television set and other goods, Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a number of parishioners, the police have compiled a list of about 
30 church members who are suspected of helping the rebels. They are apparently 
being sought for questioning, and many are in hiding.

GORBACHEV WINS BATTLE ON PARTY ROLE

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev won a key political battle Tuesday when the 
Soviet Congress, on the opening day of its winter session, refused to support a 
call from reformists to consider whether the Communist Party should remain 
enshrined in the constitution as the dominant force in Soviet society. 
</P>
<P>
In a table-pounding speech, Gorbachev said those who want to amend the 
constitution's Article 6, which makes the party the "leading and guiding force" 
of the Soviet Union, are guilty of "political speculation" because they seek to 
misuse the mood of change in the country and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need to act on this matter as if it were an emergency," Gorbachev 
said. "Why all this drama? We must approach the matter of constitutional 
changes with great responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
In East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, reform politicians have 
shifted the role of the Communist Party so that it is no longer guaranteed the 
position of supreme political power. On Monday, Bulgaria's leadership proposed 
a multi-party system. 
</P>
<P>
Progressives in the Soviet Union have sought similar changes, warning that the 
Kremlin, which opened the way for new thinking throughout Eastern Europe, is 
now lagging behind. 
</P>
<P>
Poet Yevgeny A. Yevtushenko, who argued in favor of amending Article 6, told 
the Congress of People's Deputies: "The authority of the party must not be 
written in a paragraph. It must prove itself. It is important to the prestige 
of perestroika (Gorbachev's reform program), to the prestige of the party, that 
we change this article." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, in putting down the challenge to the party's traditional role, 
managed to deal handily with what had threatened to be one of the most 
contentious issues the deputies would discuss. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, hundreds of lawmakers indicated their support of Yevtushenko's 
call to put Article 6 on the agenda. The bid to include debate on the issue in 
the current session was rejected by a vote of 1,138 to 839, with 56 
abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a noble defeat. We got many more votes than I expected," Yevtushenko 
told reporters after the tally. 
</P>
<P>
In the same vote, the deputies also turned down calls to debate other 
constitutional articles dealing with land, property and the distribution of 
powers between the country's 15 republics and the central government. 
</P>
<P>
In what appeared to be in part a response to conservative critics who 
questioned his low-key leadership tactics during a weekend Central Committee 
plenum, Gorbachev demonstrated a leaner, firmer style in chairing the 
congressional session. 
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for the 2,250-member Congress to avoid wasting time and to 
concentrate its energy on critical economic issues, which are likely to be the 
focus of most of the debate in the days to come. 
</P>
<P>
"We need drastic reforms," he said. "So far, there are no improvements in this 
area. . . . We have many problems and many important questions. But it is the 
economy that people will be watching to see how we deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
But a long debate over procedural matters put the Congress behind schedule even 
on Day One, delaying the presentation of the government's economic plan by 
Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzkhov. 
</P>
<P>
However, Gorbachev indicated that he will not let glasnost, his policy of 
openness, be misused as some critics argued it was during the previous 
free-wheeling session last spring. 
</P>
<P>
He said he will not permit deputies to "manipulate" the proceedings by taking 
the podium to express views already aired by other lawmakers. In addition, he 
held each speaker to a strict 60 seconds at the microphone, sounding a buzzer 
to urge them to sit down, and continually warned that he wanted to hear only 
from those with new proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev demonstrated that he intended to keep a tighter rein on the deputies 
when he permitted human rights advocate Andrei D. Sakharov to take the podium 
but cut him short when he began to discuss Article 6, about which Yevtushenko 
had already spoken. Sakharov turned to Gorbachev and handed him a stack of 
telegrams that he said supported amending Article 6. 
</P>
<P>
"You come to me. I will give you three files of telegrams," Gorbachev responded 
curtly, motioning Sakharov to take his seat. 
</P>
<P>
The Congress, which is scheduled to meet for 10 days, is to consider ratifying 
legislation passed last month by the smaller Supreme Soviet, including a law 
that -- although stopping short of allowing private property -- would widen 
ownership rights. 
</P>
<P>
Another proposed law would permit farmers to privately lease land and pass it 
on to their children. 
</P>
<P>
The entire inaugural session of the Congress of Peoples' Deputies, held from 
May 25 to June 9, was broadcast live on Soviet television. But this time, only 
the opening of the Congress was broadcast live; the rest of the proceedings are 
to be shown, probably in edited form, only in the evenings. 
</P>
<P>
That is because the popularity of the first session cut work productivity by 
20% as people across the nation tuned in to listen to the often-rambling 
speeches about topics ranging from whether V. I. Lenin, the nation's founder, 
should be entombed on Red Square to previously unpublicized atrocities carried 
out under dictator Josef Stalin.

LEONA HELMSLEY GETS 4 YEARS AND $7-MILLION FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Leona Helmsley, the self-proclaimed queen of a luxury hotel chain, was 
sentenced Tuesday to four years in federal prison and fined $7.1 million by a 
judge who said her criminal tax offenses were the product of "naked greed." 
</P>
<P>
The judge imposed the sentence after Helmsley, 69, tearfully begged for mercy. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge John M. Walker Jr. told Helmsley that she had "an arrogant 
belief that she was above the law." He noted that her crime wasn't motivated by 
financial need and said that, since her conviction, she had shown no remorse. 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley and two employees were convicted in August on 33 felony counts related 
to evasion of $1.2 million in federal income taxes, including Helmsley's 
diversion of funds from the real estate and hotel companies that she and her 
husband controlled in order to pay for lavish personal expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley's trial drew intense media interest. She became a symbol of 
upper-class abuse of privilege when a former housekeeper testified that Mrs. 
Helmsley had once snapped at her: "We don't pay taxes; the little people pay 
taxes." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Walker sentenced Helmsley to three years of probation, including 
750 hours of community service at Hale House, a home for infants born addicted 
to drugs. The judge ordered her to pay the federal taxes she owes, plus 
penalties and interest, and $469,000 in New York state taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The judge allowed her to remain free on bail pending an appeal, with the amount 
of bail to be determined later. Should her appeals fail and she be sent to 
prison, she would be eligible for parole after serving a year and three months. 
</P>
<P>
As she and her husband, Harry, 80, left the courthouse Tuesday, members of a 
crowd that had gathered outside shouted "Whore!" "The queen is dead!" and 
"Bitch, you should have got a thousand years!" 
</P>
<P>
Attracted by what promised to be one of the great courtroom scenes of the year, 
scores of would-be spectators had stood in line for over an hour to get inside. 
Mrs. Helmsley, renowned from magazine ads in which she appeared as the 
perfectionist queen of the Helmsley Hotels chain, attended court in a 
long-sleeved black mock turtleneck dress with a drop waist and loose pleats. 
</P>
<P>
When the judge asked her if she had anything to say, she stood but had trouble 
getting her words out because of sobs. She said: "I'm more humiliated and 
shamed than anybody could ever imagine that I have been found guilty of a 
serious crime." 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley said that, because of the case's extensive publicity, she and her 
husband had been virtual prisoners in their home for three years, unable to 
leave because they might be attacked or jeered. She said her life was "a 
nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
She referred to her continuing grief for her son, who died in 1982, and then 
spoke of Harry, who has been judged mentally incompetent and whom she has been 
taking care of. 
</P>
<P>
"I beg you, please don't let me lose Harry too," Helmsley said. "Our whole life 
has been work and each other. We have nothing else." 
</P>
<P>
She ended her statement by saying: "I'm sorry. I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
Harry Helmsley, the founder of a New York real estate and hotel empire 
estimated to be worth $5 billion, had been indicted along with his wife. But he 
was later judged unfit to stand trial because of failing memory and didn't 
appear at all in court during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Helmsley attended Tuesday's sentencing flanked by three bodyguards. He 
appeared thoughtful and attentive. But afterward he showed no sign of having 
fully understood the proceedings. When a friend offered support and told him 
soothingly that his wife was unlikely to begin her sentence "for years and 
years," until the appeals process is exhausted, Helmsley laughed and repeated 
"years and years." 
</P>
<P>
After the sentencing, Mrs. Helmsley turned to friends in the courtroom, 
including television personality Barbara Walters, and said: "See what they've 
done to me?" 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley's attorney, Gerald Feffer, acknowledged that she deserved to be 
punished for her crimes. But he noted in court that his client will soon turn 
70 and said she has already been severely punished by the humiliation and abuse 
she has suffered at the hands of the press and public. 
</P>
<P>
Feffer said Helmsley had received death threats, as well as voluminous hate 
mail, much of it obscene and anti-Semitic. He said her position and notoriety 
mean that she would be a target of physical abuse in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Feffer had asked the judge to sentence her to perform community service at Hale 
House. Feffer told the judge that, if he felt that punishment wasn't severe 
enough, he could also sentence Helmsley to live in Harlem, in one of Hale 
House's residential facilities for mothers recovering from addiction. This, 
Feffer said, would place her in "an environment that will humble her on a daily 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
When he pronounced sentence, Judge Walker said that in making up his mind he 
had focused only on her crimes, ignoring Helmsley's "vilification" in the 
press, as well as testimony that she was sometimes cold-hearted and vindictive 
in her treatment of employees. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to paying for renovation of the 28-room Helmsley mansion in 
Greenwich, Conn., company funds were used by Mrs. Helmsley to pay for a new 
swimming pool and a $130,000 indoor/outdoor stereo system at the estate. 
</P>
<P>
According to testimony in the trial, she used company funds to pay credit card 
bills for underwear and other clothing from department stores, a $45,000 silver 
clock specially designed in the shape of the Helmsley Building in New York, and 
a leg waxing. The Helmsleys failed to disclose the money as personal income, as 
tax laws require. 
</P>
<P>
The trial included testimony about her blithely firing household employees at 
Christmastime for petty infractions and demanding cash kickbacks from firms 
that supplied liquor to the Helmsley hotels. But, in arguing for a lenient 
sentence, her lawyer presented letters from several other Helmsley employees 
for whom Mrs. Helmsley had gone out of her way to assure adequate medical 
treatment, including two who had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley, born Leona Mindy Rosenthal, came from a modest background, the 
daughter of a Brooklyn hat maker. She had had several careers before she met 
and married Harry Helmsley, including being a showroom model, cigarette vendor 
and, later, a successful Manhattan real estate broker. It was a second marriage 
for both. 
</P>
<P>
Both Mrs. Helmsley and her husband still face similar tax charges in New York 
state court. They have pleaded not guilty, and a ruling is expected on whether 
Harry Helmsley is mentally competent to stand trial on the state charges. 
</P>
<P>
Several Helmsley hotels in New York face loss of their liquor licenses because 
of Mrs. Helmsley's felony conviction. State action on the subject is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Walker told the defendants that their attempts to cheat the government 
"undermines the system of voluntary compliance" on which the nation's tax 
system depends. He said that the sentences should send a message to anyone 
thinking of falsifying a tax return that, "if you do it and you're caught, you 
will go to prison." 
</P>
<P>
The two employees who had been convicted with her also were sentenced Tuesday 
to prison terms and fines. They were convicted of helping Mrs. Helmsley cheat 
the government through false tax returns, although the wrongdoing resulted in 
little direct financial gain to the employees. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph V. Licari, 53, the chief financial officer of Helmsley Enterprises Inc., 
was sentenced to 30 months in prison, three years of probation and a $75,000 
fine. Frank J. Turco, 47, who was vice president and chief of financial 
services for Helmsley Hotels Inc., was sentenced to 24 months in prison, three 
years of probation and a $50,000 fine. Their lawyers said they don't intend to 
appeal, and the two are to begin their sentences on Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Turco has already pleaded guilty to state charges, and Licari is expected to do 
so today.

Tens of thousands of the poor in Los Angeles swamped phone lines Tuesday while 
2,000 more lined up at senior citizen centers after housing officials reopened 
enrollment in the popular Section 8 federal rent subsidy program for the first 
time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Housing Authority opened the enrollment period for only four 
days, Tuesday through Friday, resulting in a near-panic crush of more than 
180,000 phone calls to housing agency phone banks by noon Tuesday, said Pacific 
Bell spokeswoman Kathleen Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn said the phone company was alerted that phone lines had "crashed" in San 
Diego a few weeks ago when Section 8 enrollment was reopened there, and phone 
officials in Los Angeles took steps to avoid a similar disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"We handled it like you do in an earthquake, when everybody is trying to dial 
at once," Flynn said. "We let about 60% of the calls go through, but another 
71,405 calls did not go through as of noon Tuesday."

<P>
Flynn said that if emergency preparations had not been made, phone service to 
businesses and residences throughout downtown Los Angeles would have 
"completely shut down" Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The staggering number of calls was testimony to the severe need for rent 
subsidies among the city's poor families, senior citizens and disabled, who 
have been turned away by the Los Angeles Housing Authority since 1986 because 
of long waiting lists, constant demand and little federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
Applicants this week are not assured of a rent subsidy, but will be placed on 
the first waiting list to be created in three years, housing officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the good news, the program was almost immediately mired in controversy. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) and advocacy groups for the poor 
attacked the four-day period set up by Housing Authority officials, saying that 
the poorest residents, lacking televisions, telephones or regular contact with 
any social agency, will not learn about the program until it is too late to 
apply. 
</P>
<P>
"We think four days is ridiculous, unfair and inequitable," said Steven Glazer, 
press secretary to Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people calling every day, every month, for the past three years, 
asking is Section 8 ever coming back?," said Charles Elsesser, another Roberti 
aide. "Now, if they don't call this week, they miss it? There's something wrong 
with that." 
</P>
<P>
Late in the day, Roberti issued a statement praising city officials for 
deciding Tuesday morning to launch a bigger publicity campaign to alert the 
poor. Roberti called for an extension of the enrollment period to the end of 
December and for better outreach to poor families. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that 800,000 Los Angeles residents are poor enough to qualify for rent 
subsidies, Roberti said the city's efforts "still fall woefully short in a city 
as large as Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
The Section 8 program requires a tenant to pay 30% of his income to rent, while 
the federal government pays the difference, up to fair market rent. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the cost of a $500-a-month apartment is reduced to about $250 
under the program, according to Gary Squier, Housing Authority director. Those 
who qualify include poor families, the elderly, or the disabled. Their incomes 
cannot exceed $13,950 for a single person or $19,950 for a family of four. 
</P>
<P>
Squier, of the Housing Authority, said that given the reaction Tuesday, he 
probably would have set up the enrollment program for longer than four days. 
</P>
<P>
"The time period is probably too short, and in retrospect I think it should 
have been opened for a longer time," said Squier, who met with Housing 
Authority commissioners and other executives Tuesday to fashion a response to 
Roberti and other critics. 
</P>
<P>
Squier said that at the meeting it was decided that the housing agency will 
consider reopening the enrollment period in January if interest from the poor 
persists up to the deadline on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're finding on Friday that the telephone isn't ringing or isn't 
overloaded, then maybe we can make a judgment that we have done the outreach we 
need to do," Squier said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the chaos caused by the short enrollment period, there were 
signs Tuesday that seniors were getting the word more effectively than poor 
families who also qualify for Section 8. 
</P>
<P>
According to directors of 10 senior citizen centers contacted by The Times, 
most of the 2,000 applicants who appeared in person Tuesday were elderly 
persons enrolled in local senior programs who received flyers from the centers. 
The city's 18 senior centers were the only offices opened for thousands of 
walk-in applicants, of any age, who were unable to reach the Housing Authority 
by phone. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at several centers said they were told that the Housing Authority was 
trying to target senior citizens, but the centers were required by law to 
accept applications from all age groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Seniors with connections to social programs aren't the only ones who need 
help," said Roberti press aide Glazer. Poor families "need our help at least as 
much." 
</P>
<P>
People wishing to apply can call 213-484-1051 or 818-787-5136.

TRADE SCHOOLS THREATEN SUIT ON STATE RULES; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: NEW LAW AIMS AT RECRUITING AND FINANCIAL ABUSES. VOCATIONAL 
INSTITUTIONS SAY THE RESTRICTIONS ARE IMPRACTICAL AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

<P>
California's for-profit vocational schools are threatening legal action to 
block implementation of a new law that would substantially increase state 
regulation of the institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The law, authored by Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) and signed by 
Gov. George Deukmejian, affects about 2,000 schools enrolling 500,000 students 
and takes effect Jan. 1. It seeks to curb abuses by trade schools that recruit 
students from unemployment lines, persuade them to take government loans they 
cannot repay and offer instruction of such poor quality that students are not 
prepared for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The proprietary schools initially supported the legislation but now say it is 
unconstitutional and would drive many of them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"This is oppressive legislation," said Doreen Adamache, president of Sawyer 
College at Ventura, a business and graphic design school. "It would close a lot 
of us down." 
</P>
<P>
Adamache and other vocational school operators object to many provisions of the 
law but especially requirements that schools: 
</P>
<P>
* Keep enough cash on hand to pay 30 days' operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
* Maintain a ratio of current assets to current liabilities of 1.25 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
* See that at least 60% of the students complete course work and at least 70% 
be placed in jobs for which they have been trained within six months of 
completing the work. 
</P>
<P>
If these and many other conditions are not met, the state Department of 
Education can close a school. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-day cash reserve requirement is "not practical," said Coleman Furr, 
president of Coleman College in La Mesa, which grants bachelor's and master's 
degrees in computer studies. "Most institutions have to meet a payroll and pay 
the rent the first of the month and then they couldn't meet that requirement." 
</P>
<P>
But Herschel T. Elkins, a state senior assistant attorney general and a strong 
supporter of the new law, said the requirement is not unreasonable. "One would 
think that if you're operating a school you ought to have enough money on hand 
for 30 or 45 days," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Elkins also said the requirement for a 1.25-1 ratio of assets to liabilities is 
lower than that maintained by most businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Vocational educators argue that it is impractical to require that at least 60% 
of students complete a course because many drop out for reasons that have 
nothing to do with the quality of classes being offered. They also contend that 
it is unfair to require that at least 70% be placed in jobs within six months 
because local economic conditions and job markets can change quickly. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the legislation say these provisions are needed because many 
proprietary schools are more interested in enrolling students and getting their 
money than they are in providing meaningful education or training people for 
jobs that actually exist. 
</P>
<P>
The proprietary schools also have raised constitutional objections to the new 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles attorney Shirley M. Hufstedler, who represents the California Assn. 
of Private Postsecondary Schools, said the legislation violates constitutional 
protectionn involving procedural due process, equal protection, deprivation of 
property without due process and, most of all, free speech provisions of the 
First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
She said the limits on recruitment for vocational schools violate the First 
Amendment, as does a requirement for state approval before a school could 
increase the salary of any staff member by more than $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Any organization that preys on poor and desperate people is detestable," said 
Hufstedler, who was the first U.S. Secretary of Education in the administration 
of former President Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
But she said the governor, the Legislature and the attorney general were so 
concerned about getting the "bad guys" among the for-profit schools that "they 
didn't consider the constitutional aspects." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Ronald Reiter, who has been closely involved with the 
legislation, called Hufstedler's argument a "flight of fancy." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to tell Stanford University how to teach its political 
science classes here," Reiter said. "This is not an academic freedom issue. 
We're trying to set some financial stability standards for these schools and 
get some protection for these students." 
</P>
<P>
The vocational schools "want to cloak themselves in the First Amendment," he 
added, "but really they're performing a business function, not some lofty 
academic purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Elkins said he is meeting with Hufstedler, other proprietary school 
representatives, members of Assemblywoman Waters' staff and officials of the 
state Department of Education to discuss possible changes in the law. But, he 
said, "it doesn't appear to us at this point that there is a valid argument to 
be made." 
</P>
<P>
Hufstedler said that if these meetings do not produce an agreement, she will 
seek a Superior Court restraining order and preliminary injunction against 
implementation of the law. Elkins and Reiter said the law is needed because 
some for-profit schools are exploiting low-income students by enrolling them in 
classes they are not likely to finish and then persuading them to take several 
thousand dollars' worth of federal and state loans -- money that ends up in the 
schools' coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does this contribute to a high loan default rate among vocational 
school students (more than 30%), they pointed out, but students who default are 
ineligible for other federal programs such as low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Reiter said, some of the instruction is so poor that many students 
drop out or "don't have the skills to get a job even if they finish the 
course." 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is very, very serious," he said. "We currently have complaints 
about a couple of dozen schools that enrolled about 100,000 students last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
The uproar over the Waters bill is surprising because it sailed through the 
Legislature with almost no opposition. 
</P>
<P>
This happened, according to Cathy Sizemore, lobbyist for the California Assn. 
of Private Postsecondary Schools, because members of Waters' staff and Reiter, 
representing the attorney general, promised to make changes in the bill's 
language but did not do so. 
</P>
<P>
"We supported the bill because of the agreement that they would make these 
changes," Sizemore said, "but the amendments they added were contrary to what 
we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
"That's complete nonsense," Reiter replied. "We put in everything we agreed to 
put in and we took out everything we agreed to take out. Every commitment we 
made, we honored. . . . It sounds like they may be trying to cover up their own 
failures."

CHAMPION OF POOR SELECTED AS L.A.'S NEW HUD DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Ming, regional director of HUD in Oklahoma, has been named to take over 
the massive Los Angeles district office of the federal housing agency from 
longtime director Benjamin Bobo. 
</P>
<P>
Known in Oklahoma as an outspoken advocate for fair housing and improved living 
conditions for the poor, Ming will arrive in Los Angeles in February, according 
to Robert J. De Monte, Western regional director of the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Ming's appointment comes at a time when the federal agency is attempting to 
clean up a wide-ranging scandal involving misuse of funds and the awarding of 
scarce federal funds to developers who used well-connected Republican 
lobbyists. The scandal has focused attention on many East Coast cities, and 
California has figured less prominently. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more a career move than tied to any initiatives of Secretary Jack Kemp to 
(reform HUD), but Ming is definitely committed to the initiatives of the 
secretary and we are happy to have him," De Monte said. "He has dealt well with 
troubled properties in Oklahoma." 
</P>
<P>
Ming will face many challenges in Los Angeles, where 21 run-down, World War 
II-era public housing projects shelter 31,000 of the city's poorest residents. 
The two-story projects, sprinkled from San Pedro to the San Fernando Valley but 
concentrated largely in minority inner-city areas, are in need of costly 
modernization and many are overrun by crack cocaine dealers. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Ming, a lawyer and former Municipal Court judge who 
joined HUD six years ago, said he has read Los Angeles newspapers and was moved 
by the severe homelessness here, which he said was "unlike anything we have 
ever seen in Oklahoma." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to seeing what I can do in ending the tragedy of 
homelessness, as Secretary Kemp says. That's a major priority of mine in this 
new position," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ming said he also intends to attack drug dealing in the city's housing projects 
and in privately owned low-income rental housing subsidized by HUD. 
</P>
<P>
"After homelessness, the one thing that is most important is making public and 
subsidized housing drug-free, and that may be easier to say than to do in Los 
Angeles," Ming said. "I think there are some people in L.A. who won't want me 
to do that, like the Crips and the Bloods." 
</P>
<P>
Bobo, who has been with HUD since 1981, was offered a reassignment in October 
to run operations for HUD in New Orleans, but he has turned it down, according 
to Scott Reed, HUD spokesman in Los Angeles. Reed said Bobo "has announced no 
formal plans at this time." Bobo could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the low-profile Bobo who rarely granted interviews, Ming's hands-on 
style in Oklahoma often landed him coverage in the newspapers as he cracked 
down on slumlords and spoke out against drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
In one widely publicized move last July, Ming seized two Tulsa apartment 
complexes controlled by Associated Financial Corp., a Santa Monica firm that 
has interests in 45,000 HUD-subsidized rental units for the poor nationwide but 
has recently run into trouble at some of its projects. 
</P>
<P>
In foreclosing on Associated Financial's Tulsa holdings, Ming decried the 
"unlivable" conditions at the two long-neglected apartment complexes, calling 
the private partnership created by Associated Financial to buy and own the 
properties "nameless, faceless slumlords." 
</P>
<P>
However, Ming said Tuesday "there is no hidden" agenda in his being named 
director in Los Angeles -- in the back yard of Associated Financial. 
</P>
<P>
"They probably aren't happy that I am coming to town, but I have absolutely no 
hidden agenda on that; nobody has said to me, 'Be involved with (Associated 
Financial),' " he said. "I will work with all projects exactly the same. 
Whoever owns them makes no difference to me. Housing quality is major, in my 
opinion, and I will enforce it whether it's in Oklahoma, Tulsa or Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Associated Financial officials could not be reached for comment.

SULLIVAN WILL NAME PANEL FOR REVIEW OF FDA;

HEALTH: CRITICS SAY THE AGENCY HAS FAILED TO ENSURE FOOD AND DRUG SAFETY. ITS 
DEPARTING CHIEF HAS HARSH WORDS FOR CONGRESS.

<P>
In a move aimed at restoring the credibility of the embattled Food and Drug 
Administration, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said 
Tuesday that he is forming an advisory panel to conduct a comprehensive 
one-year review of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's announcement came just a week before the departure of FDA 
Commissioner Frank E. Young, who fired a parting blast Tuesday at lawmakers who 
"grandstand" on FDA issues without providing enough funding to ensure that the 
agency can carry out its mandate. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA has been a target of growing criticism in recent years from congressmen 
and consumer groups who contend that it has failed to ensure the safety of the 
food, drug and medical products it monitors or to make potential new treatments 
available to AIDS victims. 
</P>
<P>
"This advisory committee will explore current concerns about the FDA and 
develop policy or structural recommendations to address any problems they 
uncover," Sullivan told the annual education conference of the Food and Drug 
Law Institute, a nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clearly in the public interest for this committee to carefully examine 
every aspect of the FDA," Sullivan said. He said he would give the panel a full 
year to study the agency and prepare its report. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee, said creation of the commission may be too little, too late. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't afford to wait (a year) for their report before we go ahead and make 
the necessary changes," said a spokesman for Dingell, whose oversight 
subcommittee has been conducting an aggressive investigation of the FDA. 
"There's just not that kind of time." 
</P>
<P>
Young, who has been characterized by sources on Capitol Hill and at the FDA as 
a scapegoat for the agency's growing problems, will vacate his post Monday to 
become deputy assistant secretary for health, science and the environment at 
HHS. 
</P>
<P>
Although his new assignment is higher in rank, the move was perceived widely as 
a demotion. A replacement for Young at FDA has not yet been named. 
</P>
<P>
The problems prompting the review have included disclosures of fraud, 
corruption and mismanagement in the agency's generic drugs division, attacks by 
AIDS activists unhappy with the FDA's pace in making new therapies available 
and continuing criticism of agency performance in regulating food imports, 
medical devices and other items. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate farewell speech at the food and drug conference, Young defended 
the FDA and reprimanded lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had enough -- too much -- of politicians who view civil servants as part 
of the problem," Young said, noting that the agency needs competitive salaries 
and better facilities. "To fully get through this, the FDA needs a little 
breathing room to reassess its priorities and to develop a strategy for the 
next decade." 
</P>
<P>
His comments reflected bitterness toward recent events. 
</P>
<P>
"The agency deserves the guarantee of no new responsibilities without 
concomitant resources," he said. "While the FDA is most willing to accept 
constructive criticism from the Congress, such criticism should be factually 
based and consistent with a reasonable assessment of agency priorities." 
</P>
<P>
The 13-member panel is expected to be formed in several weeks.

This year's White House Christmas card depicts the snow-covered South Portico 
of the presidential mansion decorated for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
The card is a reproduction of a watercolor by artist William T. Gemmell, who 
has directed the White House's Office of Graphics and Calligraphy since 1977. 
It is the first time that his art has been featured on a White House Christmas 
card. 
</P>
<P>
The scene shows the White House draped in greenery with a single wreath and red 
bow hanging from the Truman Balcony. The White House Christmas tree is visible 
through the windows of the Blue Room. 
</P>
<P>
The message inside reads: "The President and Mrs. Bush extend their warmest 
wishes that Christmas and the New Year will hold much happiness and peace for 
you and those you love." 
</P>
<P>
As many as 150,000 cards will be mailed during the next week, with the 
Republican National Committee picking up the cost of printing and mailing. The 
Reagans sent 125,000 cards last year. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Goodman, a committee spokeswoman, said it is not known how much the card 
mailing will cost. "We don't know until the bills come in. That's about a month 
from now," she said.

GREENPEACE WILL GIVE A WIDE BERTH AT TRIDENT LAUNCH

Greenpeace anti-nuclear activists, their ship damaged by the Navy during a 
protest last week of a Trident 2 missile launch, said Tuesday they will observe 
an upcoming launch but will not try to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
"Our intention is not to physically obstruct the upcoming Trident test, but to 
exercise our rights to protest in international waters," said Shannon Fagan, a 
Greenpeace spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
She said a 60-foot-ketch, the Mondeivitano, would sail to the vicinity of the 
test site later this week "and will maintain the same distance from the site as 
other Navy vessels." 
</P>
<P>
The Trident submarine launch area is in the Atlantic 50 miles off Cape 
Canaveral. During a test launch, the Navy declares a 5,000-yard radius safety 
zone around the submarine.

Last week, the MV Greenpeace penetrated the safety zone and dispatched two 
motorized rafts in an effort to halt a launch from the submerged submarine 
Tennessee. But a Navy submarine support ship bumped the Greenpeace vessel 
several times and used fire hoses to shoot water down the smokestacks to stop 
the engines. Small Navy boats corraled the rafts.

CASOLO'S RELEASE PREDICTED; NOT YET, SALVADORAN JUDGE SAYS 
</P>

The lawyer for Jennifer Jean Casolo, imprisoned here on charges she aided 
leftist guerrillas, is working to have the American woman released, but the 
military court handling the case warned Tuesday that freedom may not come so 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo, arrested by National Police last month when they uncovered an arms 
cache during a raid on her house, is charged with terrorism, possession of war 
weapons and related crimes. She maintains she is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo's attorney, Salvador Ibarra, said Tuesday he is confident that motions 
he filed on Monday to have the case dropped will be accepted by the court. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a very good chance she will be released," Ibarra said after meeting 
with the judge, Guillermo Romero Hernandez. Ibarra predicted Casolo could be 
out of jail by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
But Romero, apparently taken aback by Ibarra's assertions, said he is reviewing 
the case and has yet to make any ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"The case is still being processed," Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
What happens next in Casolo's case remains unclear. While Romero could free the 
28-year-old Thomaston, Conn., woman, the investigation could continue and a 
trial still could be held. 
</P>
<P>
In a writ filed Monday, Ibarra said the case against Casolo was without merit 
because there wasn't sufficient evidence to try her. 
</P>
<P>
Further, he argued, she should be released on a technicality. Ibarra said that 
under a state of emergency declared by the government last month, the 
applicable laws to charge Casolo did not exist at the time of her arrest. The 
state of emergency, imposed in response to a fierce guerrilla offensive 
launched Nov. 11, suspends numerous laws, and emergency legislation technically 
did not go into effect until after Casolo was jailed, Ibarra asserted. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they unearthed more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition, grenades and 
explosives in an underground tunnel in the back yard of a house Casolo rented 
in May. The weapons were being stockpiled for Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front rebels who are fighting to oust the U.S.-backed Salvadoran 
government, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo, who coordinated tours for visiting delegations of church workers and 
congressional aides for a religious group called Christian Educational 
Seminars, is being held in the Ilopango Women's Prison. 
</P>
<P>
Early Tuesday, Ibarra had told a group of reporters that Casolo would be freed 
before the end of the day. The premature announcement led to speculation that 
Ibarra was trying to bring pressure onto authorities to force her release. 
</P>
<P>
But Ibarra insisted that the judge had promised to release Casolo, then backed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"This case is a hot potato for the judge," Ibarra said. "He has the eyes of the 
world upon him, and he has to dispose of it before he gets burned."

Japan will temporarily halt its drift-net fishing in the South Pacific by 1992 
if steps have not been taken by then to preserve marine life in the region, the 
Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and South Pacific nations have criticized Japan and Taiwan 
for using giant drift nets in the region. The nets sweep as much as 30 miles of 
ocean, and critics say they kill virtually all fish and marine animals that 
swim into them. 
</P>
<P>
"In the South Pacific we will stop, at least temporarily, the catching of 
albacore tuna by an agreed date, with the expectation that when 
management-control measures for the preservation of marine resources are agreed 
upon, it will be reopened," Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said. 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe did not say when Japan would halt the practice, but another Foreign 
Ministry official said it would be by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Kyodo News Service said Japanese and U.S. representatives at the United Nations 
have agreed on a draft resolution calling for an end to drift-net fishing in 
the region's international waters by June 30, 1992, except where protective 
measures have been taken. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the decision would not apply to the North Pacific because 
conservation measures are being taken in that region.

DEMOCRATS PREDICT DEFEAT OF VETO ON CHINA STUDENTS

House Democrats angry about the Bush Administration's overtures to China 
predicted Tuesday that there will be strong bipartisan support when Congress 
tries to override President Bush's veto of a bill aiding Chinese students in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have enough to override," said California Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San 
Francisco). "We feel the President's actions this weekend are such a slap in 
the face to the forces of democracy and such an encouragement of a tyrannical 
regime that it is making our job easier." 
</P>
<P>
Pelosi said she has received assurances from House and Senate leaders, 
including House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, that Congress would make consideration 
of the veto override its first order of business when it reconvenes in January. 
</P>
<P>
The vetoed bill, sponsored by Pelosi, would allow Chinese students to remain in 
the United States indefinitely if they fear retaliation at home. Bush contended 
he could accomplish the same thing by executive order. 
</P>
<P>
The bill passed Congress overwhelmingly last month. Pelosi said at a news 
conference that she was gaining commitments from Democrats and Republicans to 
support an override, predicting a strong bipartisan majority. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders made clear their strong disagreement with Bush's decision to 
send National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State 
Lawrence S. Eagleburger to Beijing over the weekend for the first high-level 
meetings with Chinese leaders since the crackdown in Tian An Men Square in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Sam Gejdenson (D-Conn.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs 
subcommittee on international economic policy and trade, called the trip "an 
outrage . . . a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
He scheduled a hearing today on the trip and said Eagleburger was invited to 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
"The butchers of Beijing have been consolidating their power, increasing 
tyranny in China, and the Administration then goes and sends two of its top 
people to China," Gejdenson said. 
</P>
<P>
"What kind of message is this to those in the East Bloc who want to use 
military force to crush the democratic movements?" he asked. "Is this a 
statement by the Administration that it has one standard for human rights in 
Eastern Europe, and another standard for human rights in Asia?" 
</P>
<P>
Bush gained support, however, from Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), who called the 
criticism premature and said the trip was "a risky but thoughtful consultation" 
that could lead to moderation by China. 
</P>
<P>
"If China significantly moderates over the course of the next year, Bush will 
be vindicated," Leach said. "If not, the Administration runs the danger of 
being perceived as helping to legitimize a less than legitimate regime in 
Beijing." 
</P>
<P>
Zhao Haiching, chairman of the National Committee on Chinese Student Affairs, 
met with Pelosi, later telling reporters the visit will strengthen the 
hard-liners in Beijing and encourage a "slide into darkness." 
</P>
<P>
Zhao said thousands of young people are being jailed and tortured in China and 
that the government has begun a new round of suppression against intellectuals. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, he said, some Chinese students who have demonstrated 
against their government have been intimidated and harassed by Chinese 
authorities. He said the Chinese government has warned students that if they 
persist, they will be regarded as counterrevolutionaries and punished when they 
return to China.

Members of the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies spent 20 minutes figuring 
out a new automatic voting system Tuesday -- and then took the first vote by a 
show of hands. 
</P>
<P>
The Dutch-made Philips computers installed in the Palace of Congresses baffled 
many deputies despite a lengthy explanation by Valentin Tetenov, chairman of 
the Information and Communications Commission. He asked for a mock vote to see 
how many were present, and the electronic board at the front of the hall 
displayed the figure 333. However, 2,106 deputies were registered. 
</P>
<P>
A second attempt at using the new gadgets produced a head count of 1,985. "We 
have done a bit better this time but still seem to have lost a few deputies in 
the process," Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev remarked. 
</P>
<P>
"Equipment is equipment, but let's elect a counting commission just in case we 
need it," Gorbachev said.

INDEPENDENT OPPOSITION PARTIES FORMED IN YUGOSLAVIA

<P>
Two independent opposition parties Tuesday announced their formation in Serbia, 
defying hard-line Communist policies in the largest Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, the national Communist Party called for reconciliation between 
Serbia and the reformist Slovenian republic. The party's ruling Politburo also 
said the situation in the country is "characterized by strained ethnic 
relations and tendencies toward the country's disintegration." 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen prominent Belgrade intellectuals announced that they are forming the 
Democratic Party, while a group within the official Serbian Socialist Youth 
Organization is establishing the Movement for Democratic Renewal. 
</P>
<P>
Serbia's Communist authorities, headed by President Slobodan Milosevic, have in 
the past vehemently opposed introduction of Western-style political pluralism 
in the southern republic. 
</P>
<P>
Several independent political and human rights groups have been banned in 
Serbia, and some of the activists are being prosecuted for taking part in the 
groups' work. 
</P>
<P>
Snezana Aleksic, an ideologist for Serbia's Communists, said Monday that the 
formation of independent political parties will lead to the breakup of 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the authorities in the northern republics of Slovenia and Croatia 
have lent their support to the establishment of opposition parties that are to 
take part in the first-ever multi-party elections early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Croatia's Communist leadership, at its congress in Zagreb, for the first time 
openly urged the establishment of a parliamentary democracy in Yugoslavia.

U.S. SCALES DOWN NATO WAR GAME AS EUROPEAN TENSIONS EASE 
</P>

<P>
In another reflection of easing U.S.-Soviet military tensions, the Pentagon 
announced Tuesday that it is sharply scaling back the annual war game in which 
NATO allies practice their response to a Warsaw Pact invasion in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Only two years ago, 125,000 allied soldiers took part in the "Return of Forces 
to Germany" (Reforger) exercise, which is designed to simulate a massive U.S. 
reinforcement of NATO forces in the event of a non-nuclear war in Western 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the number of allied troops will be 
reduced to 57,500 in this year's exercise, which begins Dec. 28 in West 
Germany. Of the total, 15,000 will be American soldiers. A further 12,000 
support personnel will operate out of unit headquarters in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The Army, whose $100-million request for Reforger funds was trimmed by $15 
million, also has decided not to use 1,200 of its main battle tanks in the 
exercise, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
The reduced scale of the exercise also is designed to blunt rising discontent 
among West Germany's civilian population with the noise and destruction caused 
by large-scale military maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
American military officials have argued that the training benefits of the war 
games could be replicated more cheaply and with less disruption to civilians if 
the allies made more use of training simulators and "command post exercises." 
</P>
<P>
"I've felt for a long time that we over-exercise," Gen. John Galvin, commander 
of North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces, said in a recent interview. 
"Simulators are the wave of the future." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Galvin acknowledged that the growing improbability of a 
Warsaw Pact attack on Western Europe brought about by the changes sweeping 
through Eastern Europe has increased pressure to minimize the disruptions of 
military maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Reforger exercise and its central military maneuver, called 
Centurion Shield, will bring 15,000 U.S. troops to West Germany. They will 
include units from the 10th Mountain Division with Light Infantry from Ft. 
Drum, N.Y., the 2nd Armored Division based at Ft. Hood, Tex., and the 194th 
Armored Brigade based at Ft. Knox, Ky. A brigade from the Alabama National 
Guard also will take part. 
</P>
<P>
This year's exercise was initially planned to involve 88,700 soldiers, 
including 17,400 U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
The changes come as the Defense Department, responding to the waning threat of 
Soviet aggression, considers ways to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
The Army is preparing to cut its 222,000-person force in Western Europe by 
almost one-third, to about 150,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force units in Western Europe, now numbering roughly 87,000 servicemen and 
women, would be scaled back to about 50,000, defense officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The Army would shrink its more than four divisions in Western Europe to a force 
of about two divisions, according to Army officials. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't ante up a corps (roughly two divisions), we're not in the game," 
said one Army official involved in the service's long-range planning. 
</P>
<P>
Another 13 Army divisions, many of them retrained and re-equipped for rapid 
deployment, would be scattered throughout the United States and the Pacific 
under an Army blueprint for the future.

The Chinese press lashed out at the choice of the Dalai Lama for the Nobel 
Peace Prize, charging that the choice was politically motivated and instigated 
by "some Western countries" to pressure China. The exiled spiritual leader of 
Tibet's Buddhists accepted the award in Norway two days ago. The Dalai Lama 
fled the Himalayan country in 1959 after an abortive uprising put down by 
Chinese troops. The Chinese government portrays him as a separatist who incites 
anti-Chinese sentiment in Tibet.

Drugs, including cocaine and heroin, should be legalized, taxed and dispensed 
by the state because the war on drugs is being lost, U.S. District Judge Robert 
W. Sweet said in a New York City speech. The result, he said, "would be the 
elimination of the profit motive, the gangs, the drug dealers." Sweet said the 
effort to stem the drug epidemic by jailing more people is not working. Sweet 
said he believes the root cause of the drug epidemic is the attraction of high 
profits for those in poverty.

Tennessee Secretary of State Gentry Crowell, a political kingpin known as "The 
Godfather" whose office has been one target of a corruption investigation, shot 
and critically wounded himself in a suicide attempt, authorities said. Crowell, 
57, put a .38-caliber handgun into his mouth and pulled the trigger in the back 
yard of his home in Lebanon, Tenn., authorities said. Surgeons removed the 
bullet from Crowell's skull in a three-hour operation at Vanderbilt University 
Medical Center in Nashville. He was listed in very critical condition. On July 
17, state Rep. Ted Ray Miller committed suicide with a shotgun at his home in 
Knoxville while he was the focus of an extortion probe.

COURT RULES AGAINST MENORAH DISPLAY

<P>
A federal appeals court ruled that the display of a 16-foot menorah in a 
Burlington, Vt., park is unconstitutional because it violates the separation of 
church and state. In a 2-1 decision, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in 
New York reversed a lower court's decision allowing the city to issue a permit 
to a Jewish group to erect the menorah in a park next to City Hall. The appeals 
judges based their decision on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in July that a 
creche inside a Pittsburgh courthouse was not permissible but a menorah in 
front of a nearby government building was because it was paired with a 
Christmas tree.

The space shuttle Columbia will not be ready for a scheduled blastoff Monday on 
a 10-day flight, but officials at Kennedy Space Center said they are confident 
the shuttle will make it into orbit before Christmas Eve. For launch Monday, 
Columbia's countdown would have to begin Friday. But Larry Ellis, the NASA 
manager in charge of the shuttle's launch processing, said work at the launch 
pad would not be completed in time. The goal of the mission is the launch of a 
communications satellite and the retrieval of a scientific satellite.

Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks, which abut each other in the Sierra, 
are the first in the nation to resume a policy of letting some lightning fires 
burn themselves out, officials reported. A National Park Service policy of 
letting selected fires burn naturally was suspended last year after a decision 
to let wildfires go uncontrolled in Yellowstone National Park was criticized. 
The suspension has been lifted only at Sequoia and Kings Canyon after approval 
by regional director Lew Albert of the park service of a revised fire 
management plan for the two parks, spokesman William Tweed said. Fires will be 
allowed to burn only within specific ranges of temperature, wind speed and fuel 
moisture, Tweed said. Enough firefighters must be on hand to put out a fire if 
necessary. "The goal of the program is to perpetuate the role of natural fire 
in park ecosystems without threatening public safety or property," Tweed said.

PUNITIVE DAMAGE AWARDS UP

<P>
The Assn. for California Tort Reform said punitive damage awards by juries have 
risen 266% since 1987. Association President Frank Schubert issued a statement 
with a report saying, "When one out of 10 jury verdicts is likely to result in 
a punitive damage award averaging more than $4 million, it is not difficult to 
understand why business leaders are leery of California's legal climate. It is 
a major reason why California is slowly losing its competitive edge to lesser 
competitors." A review of 1,868 verdicts by Jury Verdicts Weekly showed that 
the average punitive damage award is nearly $4.4 million. While the percentage 
of cases resulting in punitive damages has declined from 16.1% in 1987 to 9.9% 
in 1989, the average dollar amount being awarded has increased from $1.64 
million in 1987 to $4.38 million in 1989.

A young man who died in San Francisco over the weekend gave six people a chance 
to live because he served as donor of seven separate major organs. Medical 
officials said the man, whose name, age and cause of death were not released, 
donated the following organs to patients in desperate need: His heart went to a 
person suffering from terminal cardiac disease, and one of his kidneys aided a 
patient with renal disease. His other kidney and his pancreas went to a patient 
with diabetes and renal failure. The man's liver went to a patient whose own 
liver was no longer able to cleanse toxic wastes from the blood. One of his 
lungs helped a woman who had been awaiting a transplant for a year; the other 
lung went to a woman who had spent five years with a lethal lung disease. The 
lung transplants were performed at Stanford University Hospital, while the 
other organs were transplanted into four patients at Pacific Presbyterian 
Medical Center in San Francisco.

NORTH CAROLINA STATE IS PUT ON NCAA PROBATION; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: TWO-YEAR PENALTY WILL KEEP THE WOLFPACK FROM APPEARING IN 
NCAA OR NATIONAL INVITATION TOURNAMENTS THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK ASHER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The NCAA put the North Carolina State basketball program on probation Tuesday 
for two years because of violations involving the sale of complimentary tickets 
and sneakers during the past four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The sanctions will keep the Wolfpack out of this season's NCAA or National 
Invitation tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Valvano, who resigned recently as athletic director as a result of an 
internal investigation, will remain as basketball coach, interim Chancellor 
Larry Monteith said at a news conference in Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
"The report pinpoints institutional responsibilities and does not single out 
individual responsibilities," Monteith said. "Therefore, no personnel actions 
are called for at this time, nor will any be taken based solely on this report. 
However, I will continue my evaluation of the men's basketball program." 
</P>
<P>
Besides ordering the postseason ban, the NCAA concurred with the school's 
self-imposed sanctions resulting from the internal investigation: no off-campus 
recruiting for a year, no paid recruiting visits for a year and a limit of 12 
basketball scholarships, instead of the customary 15, during each of the next 
two academic years. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA suspended a sanction that would have kept the school's team off live 
television for a year because of "mitigating circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
The school also will not be required to return any of its $1.7-million share of 
NCAA tournament revenues during the past four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA said it did not impose harsher penalties because the school "undertook 
corrective and punitive actions" before the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State will be allowed to participate in the ACC tournament. 
Commissioner Gene Corrigan said the conference voted Tuesday to allow the 
Wolfpack in. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA cited North Carolina State officials' prompt reporting of alleged 
violations to the NCAA and cooperation in the investigation after a book jacket 
for author Peter Golenbock's book, "Personal Fouls," had become public. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano said that being barred from the NCAA tournament was "as serious a hurt 
and blow as I have had personally in my life." But despite the loss of 
potential revenues -- the tournament brought North Carolina State $707,000 last 
year -- he said, "We accept the NCAA findings and its punishment." 
</P>
<P>
The infractions committee said that, although North Carolina State did not gain 
"a competitive advantage" from its transgressions, the case was major because 
of the lack of institutional control or monitoring and because the violations 
were "not isolated or inadvertent." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA cited "as many as 650" instances of improper use of complimentary 
tickets, which are limited to family members, fellow students and teammates' 
family. The NCAA said that several team members during the 1985-86, 1986-87 and 
1987-88 seasons each received a total of more than $1,000 in value for the 
complimentary tickets. 
</P>
<P>
They sold for as much as $150 each, and players also traded them for stereo 
equipment and other items. The NCAA concluded that some of the team's managers, 
at the urging of players, changed the names on the complimentary list shortly 
before games began. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding sneakers, the NCAA said that "excessive numbers of shoes" were made 
available to basketball players, "with little or no effort to keep track of the 
shoes" by the school. Some players sold them to other athletes and fellow 
students, according to the NCAA, and several players exchanged the shoes, 
valued at $75 a pair, at a local sporting good store for other shoes and 
apparel of equal value. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, the failure to exercise institutional responsibility concerned 
matters of omission, such as the absence of adequate compliance monitoring 
systems and slow responses to correct practices and procedures that the 
institution and its then director of athletics . . . should have recognized as 
fraught with potential for rules violations," the infractions committee 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA also cited four secondary violations, involving free meals, lodging 
and transportation, but said those violations had no impact on the sanctions 
imposed. 
</P>
<P>
Valvano, who coached the Wolfpack to the 1983 NCAA title, has a clause in his 
contract that provides him with a $500,000 payoff if the university fires him, 
unless he is directly linked with an NCAA rules violation. Becky French, the 
university counsel, said there is nothing in the NCAA findings that would 
exempt the university from having to make such a payoff at this time. 
</P>
<P>
"Personal Fouls" claimed that grades had been changed and that positive drug 
tests had been kept secret to keep players eligible. The major area of the 
internal investigation turned out to be academic abuses, however, an area not 
covered by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if the NCAA had not found any problem with shoes or tickets, there's 
still the overriding concern identified in our report in August about the abuse 
of academic rules and regulations," said Art Padilla, vice president for 
academic affairs for the University of North Carolina system. "This is being 
addressed forcefully by the institution." 
</P>
<P>
Golenbock said in a telephone interview from Pompano Beach, Fla., with the 
Associated Press that he was surprised that the NCAA had focused on players 
instead of "the tandem of Valvano and former chancellor Bruce Poulton." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the book made its impact and I'm pleased about that," Golenbock said. 
"And I'm pleased for my sources who had the guts to speak out."

My people took a meeting with the people at Fox, Disney, Warner Bros., 
Paramount, Columbia, Orion and Universal, simultaneously. They all wanted to 
hear my idea. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about this girl," I said. "She's Romanian." 
</P>
<P>
"Meryl Streep," a studio head said. 
</P>
<P>
"Not so fast. When the story opens, she's 14 years old." 
</P>
<P>
"Molly Ringwald." 
</P>
<P>
"Just listen," I said. "She's a gymnast. She was born in Moldavia." 
</P>
<P>
"Where's Moldavia?" the Fox head said. 
</P>
<P>
"Next to Ishtar," the Columbia head said. 
</P>
<P>
"Never mind Moldavia," I said. "This girl starts training at age 6." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought you said 14," the Orion head said. "Now we gotta find somebody 6?" 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe the kid from the Cosby show," the Disney head said. 
</P>
<P>
"Slow down," I said. "Forget 6. She's 14. She's 4-foot-11. She's in the 
Montreal Olympics. She's got millions of people watching her, but she gets 
perfect scores -- the first perfect scores ever. Seven of them." 
</P>
<P>
"Fabulous," the Warners' head said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sensational," the Columbia head said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sort of like Rocky, except she's a girl and she's Romanian," the Paramount 
head said. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear the girl from 'Married With Children' can do dialects," the Fox head 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Holly Hunter can pass for 14," the Universal head said. 
</P>
<P>
"Wait," I said. "Forget 14. Cut to 13 years later. She's a grown woman. She's 
older, more mature, a little chubby." 
</P>
<P>
"Roseanne!" the Orion head said. 
</P>
<P>
"Perfect! We've been looking for something for Roseanne!" the Warners' head 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be ridiculous," the Disney head said. "Roseanne can't do Romanian." 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it doesn't have to be exact," the Columbia head said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hang on," I said. "She's still thin -- just not as thin as before. Actually, 
she looks pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
"OK, then. I still say Streep." 
</P>
<P>
"Can Streep do a 28-year-old gymnast?" 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Streep can do an armadillo if she has to." 
</P>
<P>
"Let me finish," I said. "This woman sneaks out of Romania in the middle of the 
night. She leaves in darkness, crawls through fences, dodges soldiers, doesn't 
even tell her family she's leaving. She wants to defect to America." 
</P>
<P>
"I like it. Patriotic movies are hot," the Universal head said. 
</P>
<P>
"This sounds like TV stuff to me," the Fox head said. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the violence? Where's the profanity? Where's the sex?" 
</P>
<P>
"How about this?" I asked. "It turns out she's involved with a Florida roofer 
who's married and a father of four. She breaks up his marriage. People call her 
a home wrecker. And she says: 'So what?' " 
</P>
<P>
"Fabulous," the Paramount head said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sensational," the Orion head said. 
</P>
<P>
"Doesn't sound right for us," the Disney head said. 
</P>
<P>
"She sounds hard. She sounds mean," the Columbia head said. "Maybe Glenn Close 
could do it." 
</P>
<P>
"She could kidnap the roofer's wife or cook her pet rabbit or something." 
</P>
<P>
"What's the roofer's name?" 
</P>
<P>
"Constantine," I said. "Or something like that." 
</P>
<P>
"I like it. We get Sean Connery or somebody." 
</P>
<P>
"He's torn. He's in love with his wife, but he's always wanted to have an 
affair with a gymnast." 
</P>
<P>
"She seduces him on the uneven bars." 
</P>
<P>
"Or on a roof, while he's, you know, roofing." 
</P>
<P>
"That's it. We use the song, 'Up on the Roof.' You know, like 'Stand by Me' and 
'Sea of Love.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Wait. We don't want the woman to be too unsympathetic." 
</P>
<P>
"What's her name?" 
</P>
<P>
"Nadia Comaneci," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ugh. We'll have to change that. Too foreign." 
</P>
<P>
"Why? We used Amadeus. He was foreign." 
</P>
<P>
"We'll call it: 'Swing to Freedom.' " 
</P>
<P>
"No way. We call it: 'Hop, Jump and Skip.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Can we buy the rights to her story?" 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely," I said. "Soon as she got to America, Nadia said she wanted to 
make a movie about her life." 
</P>
<P>
"Will it play in Peoria?" 
</P>
<P>
"Is anybody interested in Romanians in Peoria?" 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's even interested in Romanians in Moldavia." 
</P>
<P>
"Nadia's a hot subject," I said. "Some people say she's a brave, gutsy woman. 
Other people say she should be deported. The important thing is, we should 
hurry up and make a movie before everybody forgets who she is." 
</P>
<P>
"I can hear the critics now," the Fox head said. " 'On a scale of one to 10, 10 
being best, Nadia scores another perfect 10!' " 
</P>
<P>
"We could even bring back Bo Derek," the Universal head said. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that the one who plays for the Raiders?" the Columbia head said. 
</P>
<P>
"Streep," the Disney head said. 
</P>
<P>
"Cher," the Warners' head said. 
</P>
<P>
"We put Madonna in that gymnastic leotard, we gross $200 million, easy," the 
Orion head said.

It opens next Christmas, at a theater near you.

MORNING BRIEFING: THE TAP RUNS DRY IN PHILLY AFTER AVALANCHE OF SNOWBALLS

Snow and alcohol don't mix, at least not at city-owned Veterans Stadium in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Because of snowball throwing and brawling Sunday at the Eagles-Dallas Cowboys 
game, the Eagles have announced a ban on alcoholic beverages in the stadium and 
at tailgate parties in surrounding parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
The snowball attacks worsened as Sunday's game wore on. The Cowboys might have 
been the primary targets, but snow and ice hit officials, Eagle cheerleaders 
and fans sitting in the line of fire. 
</P>
<P>
As the Cowboys left the field after a 20-10 loss, fans poured snow, ice and 
beer on them. A policeman guarding Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson was hit in the 
face by a snowball and was treated by team trainers. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle owner Norman Braman said nearly 70 fans thrown out of the stadium will 
lose their season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Add rowdyism: Cowboy punter Mike Saxon, on the incident: "Maybe (our fans) can 
throw something at (the Eagles) in Dallas. Something like cow dung." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: The average active NFL head coach spent 9 1/2 years as an 
assistant. Which one spent the longest time as an assistant? 
</P>
<P>
Send in the clowns: The Pittsburgh Steelers' official publication, Steeler 
Digest, on the team's 23-16 loss to the Houston Oilers in the snow Dec. 3: 
"Referee Ben Dreith and his crew were horrible, and the league office might 
want to consider issuing them mini-tricycles, big floppy rubber feet and 
plastic carnations that squirt water, because if they're going to act like 
them, they might as well look like them." 
</P>
<P>
Fresh infusion: Tired of seeing yet another early knockout by Mike Tyson or a 
walk-through such as last week's "Uno Mas" fight? Glasnost might put excitement 
back in the sweet science. 
</P>
<P>
Seven Soviet boxers, all champions in their weight classes, announced in 
Toronto that they would begin training there for professional bouts. 
</P>
<P>
New York promoter Lou Falcigno, who has a deal with the Soviets, said: "One 
fight between a Soviet heavyweight, of course with the right buildup, and a 
Mike Tyson could easily be worth a quarter of a billion dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Heavyweight Alexander Burmistrov, 26, has 157 victories in 169 fights. Through 
an interpreter, Burmistrov said he eventually would defeat Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
Add Soviets: Alexander Smirnoff, a defenseman for the touring Khimik team of 
the Soviet Union, after playing against the Kings, the Edmonton Oilers and the

LOYOLA'S GATHERS FACING MORE TESTS;

<P>
BASKETBALL: DOCTORS CANNOT FIND A CAUSE FOR PLAYER'S FAINTING.

Basketball star Hank Gathers of Loyola Marymount has registered normal on all 
medical tests that have been administered early this week, but did not practice 
Tuesday, pending further tests today. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors still have not determined a reason for Gathers' fainting during 
Saturday's game against UC Santa Barbara. With about 14 minutes left, Gathers, 
who had played 23 minutes, stepped up to shoot a free throw, then slumped to 
the floor. He was unconscious for a second or two but then sat up and was 
responsive. He was taken to nearby Centinela Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
After a series of tests, including an electrocardiogram and treadmill, Gathers 
was released from the hospital on Monday and watched practice, where he was in 
good spirits and appeared to be in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
He joked Monday that he was going so strongly on the treadmill that he nearly 
broke it, adding, "I'm still the strongest man in America." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, however, Gathers again didn't feel well and stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
"All the tests so far are normal but (doctors) are trying to be extra sure, to 
cover every base," Loyola Coach Paul Westhead said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers has no history of blackouts.

UCLA: FOOTBALL COACH SAYS HE PROMOTED OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR TO REVIVE DEFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The aftermath of the worst UCLA football season in the Terry Donahue era 
brought another change in the coaching staff Tuesday, but the biggest vacuum -- 
offensive coordinator -- remains unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Robinson, who ran the offense in 1989, was given the new position of 
assistant head coach Tuesday, but most of the interest centers on his 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, coming off their worst season since 1971 with a 3-7-1 record, were 
criticized for their lack of creativity on offense last fall. Donahue also 
weathered a quarterback controversy with redshirt freshman Bret Johnson 
starting over sophomore Jim Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Both quarterbacks will return next season, along with 6-foot-5 redshirt 
freshman Tommy Maddox, but Donahue will have a new offensive coordinator to 
help him evaluate the talent. 
</P>
<P>
It has been speculated that Donahue wants to rehire Homer Smith, his highly 
respected one-time assistant, who coaches at Alabama. Smith, who is recruiting 
for the Crimson Tide, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Other speculation centered on Mike White, the former Illinois and California 
coach, Paul Hackett, one-time USC assistant who is at Pittsburgh, and John 
Featherstone, El Camino College's coach. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-year absence from coaching, White said Tuesday he hopes to return 
to the field, but has not been contacted by UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I really miss football," said White, who is a consultant with the NFL's new 
World League. "I enjoy coaching and plan to continue in the profession. My 
options are really open. I've recharged my batteries. 
</P>
<P>
"Terry (Donahue) and I are good friends. We've talked, but not about what he 
plans to do with his assistants. We haven't talked about a job." 
</P>
<P>
Hackett could not be reached, and Featherstone -- known for producing explosive 
offenses -- is one of four finalists for the Cal State Long Beach coaching 
vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
The staff shake-up began when Larry Kerr, a first-year assistant who coached 
inside linebackers and special teams, became defensive coordinator at Northern 
Arizona Monday. Kerr was hired by new Coach Steve Axman, who served as the 
Bruins' offensive coordinator in 1987-88, replacing Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Sources who declined to be identified say two other first-year assistants -- 
Dave Currey, who coached receivers, and Mike Waufle, who coached the defensive 
line -- are on the way out, but no announcement has been made. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson denied that any assistants had been fired. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, 38, was responsible for the Bruins' defensive line until last season. 
He said Donahue was moving him in an effort to reverse last season's dismal 
showing. His duties will include defense and the kicking game. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed the heck out of what I did this year," Robinson said of coaching the 
offense. "But I'm excited to go over there (to defense) and patch up things." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said his first concern was resurrecting the Bruin defense in announcing 
Tuesday's change. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said in a statement: "I asked Greg to move back to defense because I 
feel that the fastest way to turn the program around is to reconstruct our 
defensive staff. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been very successful defensively throughout the 1980s and I felt that 
putting the staff back together would be great for the program." 
</P>
<P>
Donahue said Bob Field will remain as defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA insiders said Donahue pondered the changes for three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Terry wanted to put the defensive staff back together as much as he could," 
Robinson said. "Right now, he wants to get the defense and kicking game squared 
away. We had some young people, some injuries and problems early on that hurt 
our defense. But we have some people who have some talent." 
</P>
<P>
Although the defense had its problems, the offense took the brunt of criticism 
this season. Robinson said criticism from Bruin fans did not disturb him. 
</P>
<P>
"That's part of the deal of coaching," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But one Bruin coach defended the offensive effort, saying: "There was a lot of 
creativity in our offense this year. But it wasn't hitting all the cylinders 
some of the time." 
</P>
<P>
The misfiring was most noticeable in the running game, where the Bruins lost 
their leading rusher from 1988, Eric Ball, but were supposedly deep in talent. 
However, tailbacks Brian Brown, Shawn Wills and Kevin Williams struggled behind 
a veteran offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
That could change with a new coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Smith twice was UCLA's offensive coordinator, leading teams that went 17-5 for 
Coach Pepper Rogers in 1972-73 and 59-19-5 for Donahue in 1980-86. With Axman 
as offensive coordinator, the Bruins were 20-4. Donahue had led UCLA to seven 
consecutive postseason bowl victories before this season. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, who served as an assistant at Cal State Fullerton from 1977 to '79, 
was credited with putting together the 1987 Bruin defensive line that gave up 
an average of 85.1 rushing yards to 11 regular-season opponents, fourth best in 
the country that season. 
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that kind of performance will return to Westwood where, at 
this point, change can only be for the better.

GRAF NOT EXPECTING CHALLENGE FROM EAST;

<P>
TENNIS: THE WORLD'S TOP FEMALE PLAYER SAYS CHANGING POLITICAL SITUATION WILL 
MAKE LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN HER SPORT.

Will the Berlin Wall become a tourist trap? 
</P>
<P>
Will there be reunification for Germany? 
</P>
<P>
Will anybody beat Steffi Graf? 
</P>
<P>
The wall came tumbling down, watched with interest by the most famous resident 
of Bruhl, West Germany. Graf, a 20-year-old who won $1.96 million in 1989, 
finished a year of virtual invincibility with a match record of 83-2. 
</P>
<P>
And as welcome as a new government in East Germany may be, Graf does not 
foresee any great change in the professional tennis game because of the 
dramatic political upheaval going on around her. 
</P>
<P>
If there are holes in the Berlin Wall, not too many tennis players are coming 
through them, Graf said. Apparently, developing tennis players was not a major 
concern of the ousted East German regime. 
</P>
<P>
Graf said there are no East German women players who will make an impact on the 
pro tour, even if they are given greater opportunity to travel. 
</P>
<P>
"There are none to speak of," Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the male players, Graf mentioned one, Thomas Emmerich, who telephoned 
her recently and told her he was ecstatic with the possibility of playing 
abroad, which he had never before enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
"He was never allowed to go out," Graf said. "So for him, it has meant a big 
change." 
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 player in the world for the last 2 1/2 years, Graf played Zina 
Garrison Tuesday night at the Forum as part of the Michelin Challenge 
exhibition series. 
</P>
<P>
Graf came from behind in both sets to defeat Garrison, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5). Garrison 
led, 3-1, in the first and 5-2 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
In the first match, former Stanford All-American Jeff Tarango of Manhattan 
Beach defeated national 18-and-under champion Chuck Adams of Pacific Palisades, 
6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Graf said that liberalization of East Germany might help other players, even if 
it would have no effect on her. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are good at something, you should see how you compare," she said. "It's 
a great thing. I didn't expect to see it for a long, long time. No one did. All 
the people, how they stood up for it." 
</P>
<P>
Graf, who also maintains a residence in Delray Beach, Fla., lost only to 
Gabriela Sabatini in the Amelia Island final and to Arantxa Sanchez in the 
French Open final. She won 14 tournaments, three of them Grand Slam events, her 
sixth, seventh and eighth Grand Slam victories in three years. Graf is 158-5 in 
the last two years.

4TH-QUARTER RALLY LIFTS N. HOLLYWOOD OVER DORSEY, 56-54

Sophomore guard Robert Hill sank an off-balance, four-foot jump shot with 34 
seconds to play and reserve guard Duane Braxton added a free throw 17 seconds 
later to cap a magnificent rally and give North Hollywood High a 56-54 
nonleague victory Tuesday over visiting Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies (7-0) trailed, 47-34, after Dorsey's Shaunde Fritz made a 
buzzer-beating three-point shot to end the third quarter. North Hollywood, 
however, began the final period with a 12-2 run and outscored Dorsey, 22-7. 
</P>
<P>
"We were never beaten," Hill said. "No matter what happens, we never give up. I 
think we were just a little intimidated at first." 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood Coach Steve Miller labeled the Huskies' performance both their 
best and worst of the season. North Hollywood committed 13 turnovers in the 
first half and trailed, 27-19, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey (5-2), ranked 13th in the state by at least one publication, pressured 
the Huskies into making bad passes and contained senior center Dana Jones with 
a shifting man-to-man defense. 
</P>
<P>
"They had good help, good rotation," said Jones, who scored only six points in 
the first half but finished with a game-high 17. "(The points) came real slow. 
But I knew we weren't beaten. We were just out of sync in the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Jones scored six points in the fourth quarter, including a slam-dunk and foul 
shot to pull North Hollywood to within 54-51 with 2:05 to play. VINCE KOWALICK

Rutgers fired football Coach Dick Anderson, citing the Scarlet Knights' poor 
record the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Frederick E. Gruninger said the decision was based on the 
team's field record alone, and praised Anderson's performance in strengthening 
the program since coming to the school in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's record over six seasons was 27-34-4. The Scarlet Knights had a 5-6 
record in 1988, then went 2-7 after a 2-2 start this season.

NEWSWIRE: E.GERMAN SPORTS OFFICIALS QUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The leadership of East Germany's embattled sports federation resigned Tuesday 
in response to mounting public criticism of excessive government support of 
elite athletes. 
</P>
<P>
President Klaus Eichler, his five vice presidents and the entire secretariat 
quit the German Gymnastics and Sports Federation (DTSB) in an emergency session 
at the Kienbaum training camp east of Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates charged that federation leaders were looking out for their own posts 
and urged that more attention be paid to local sports. 
</P>
<P>
Since East Germany's peaceful democratic revolt, former star athletes have come 
under criticism for enjoying privileges. Pressure has increased for funding 
more sports facilities for the public and promoting sports previously deemed 
secondary by officials, such as tennis, basketball and hockey. 
</P>
<P>
With their status endangered, top athletes have called for sports leadership to 
utilize commercial sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
A statement signed by 192 athletes, including Olympic shotput champion Ulf 
Timmermann, called on the leadership to resign, saying that it was unable to 
lead the organization at a time of rapid change in society. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Hans Modrow met Monday with athletes and officials. Modrow said he 
wanted to maintain the respected place of competitive sports but stressed that 
"much more attention must be paid to sports for all."

PACIFIC 10 OFFICIALS DECIDE TO DROP POSTSEASON BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing primarily academic reasons, Pacific 10 Conference officials voted to 
drop the annual postseason basketball tournament. The final tournament will be 
held at Arizona State, March 8-11. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing in the tournament can be a hardship for the players in the form of 
lost class time," said Jim Muldoon, assistant Pac-10 commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
"It is particularly difficult on schools that are on the quarter system because 
the tournament falls going into an exam period. Theoretically, if a school goes 
on to play in the NCAA postseason tournament, a player could miss three to four 
weeks of class time." 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for cancellation was that Pac-10 teams were forced to schedule 
conference games, rather than nonconference games, in early December. 
</P>
<P>
The cancellation of the tournament will hurt the schools financially. Since 
1987, when the tournament began, each Pac-10 school has received about 
$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to drop the tournament was initiated by Pac-10 school presidents. 
Muldoon said that Pac-10 coaches still favor the tournament.

The New York Yankees, whose 4.50 earned-run average was the second-worst in 
baseball last season behind Detroit, acquired former Dodger right-hander Tim 
Leary from the Cincinnati Reds for two minor leaguers Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees sent outfielder Hal Morris and right-hander Rodney Imes to the Reds 
for Leary and minor-league outfielder Van Snider. 
</P>
<P>
Leary, 8-14 in 1989 with a 3.52 ERA, will join Andy Hawkins and Pascual Perez 
in the Yankee rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Leary, 31, is 45-56 lifetime. He was 17-11 with a 2.91 ERA in 1988 but was 6-7 
last July 18 when the Dodgers traded him to Cincinnati along with Mariano 
Duncan for Kal Daniels and Lenny Harris. Leary was 2-7 in 14 starts for the 
Reds with a 3.71 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets real defeating when you come out of a game losing 2-1 and the chances 
are 90% you're going to get a loss," Leary said.

EXPANSION TEAMS LOSE LIKE VETERANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The new boys on the NBA block don't seem to understand. Expansion teams are 
supposed to be dreadful. They are composed of the dregs, the leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
What they are expected to do is pay big money for a franchise, but not become 
competitive for at least two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
A prime example was last year's Miami Heat. They were what expansion is all 
about. They lost their first 17 games and won only four of their first 42. 
</P>
<P>
Somebody forgot to inform the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Orlando Magic. 
They are doing much more than just winning an occasional game. They are "in" 
just about every game. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando has already beaten the New York Knicks and the Lakers, among others. 
The Timberwolves have played in tough luck. 
</P>
<P>
They have won only five of 19 games. But, they have lost four games by three or 
fewer points and every loss but one has been decided in the last quarter or in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The Timberwolves turned in a typical game Tuesday night at Indianapolis. They 
built a 12-point lead in the third quarter against the Central Division leader 
and finally lost in a wild overtime battle, 113-112. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the sharpshooting of Chuck Person and Reggie Miller was too much 
for Minnesota to overcome. Person, after missing a three-point shot with seven 
seconds left in the extra period, put in the rebound of his own miss to score 
the decisive points. 
</P>
<P>
Pooh Richardson's three-pointer with 1.8 seconds remaining left the 
Timberwolves short again. 
</P>
<P>
The Timberwolves may be even better when Steve Johnson, who recently ended his 
holdout, gets in shape. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 106, Orlando 103 -- The Magic also played a big game on the road and 
dropped a tough one, falling to 8-12. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Humphries made two free throws with six seconds remaining at Milwaukee to 
hold off the Magic. Jerry Reynold's three-pointer at the buzzer that would have 
sent the game into overtime, bounced off the back rim. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Pressey led the Bucks with 20 points and sank a jumper and two free throws 
in the last 39 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks held a 12-point lead in the third quarter, but Reggie Theus led the 
late surge by Orlando, getting nine of his 23 points in the last quarter. 
Reynolds led both teams with 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 105, Dallas 97 -- The Bulls are fortunate. Whatever they need -- -- 
rebounding, scoring, defense or playmaking -- -- they have one player who can 
provide it -- -- Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
When point guard John Paxson went out in the third quarter with a leg injury, 
Jordan became the playmaker at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, handling the ball, scored 21 of his 41 points in the fourth quarter to 
enable the Bulls to hold off the closing rush of the Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 121, Denver 108 -- It was probably the most impressive performance by 
the NBA champions this season. 
</P>
<P>
They spotted the Nuggets, who had won all nine home games, a 16-point lead in 
the second quarter, then won going away.. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Dumars led the comeback. After Denver went ahead, 50-34, Dumars scored 10 
of the Pistons' next 14 points. With the Nuggets going scoreless for almost six 
minutes, the lead was only two at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
It became a rout when the Pistons hit their first seven shots in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 102, San Antonio 94 -- David Robinson was in foul trouble early and, 
despite a valiant effort, the Spurs couldn't stop the Hawks' hot streak at 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs led most of the way, but Moses Malone and Glenn Rivers took control 
in the last quarter. Malone had 24 points and nine rebounds. Robinson had 14 
points and nine rebounds in just 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 97, Philadelphia 82 -- Dennis Hopson scored 14 of his 24 points in a 
40-17 second-half run at East Rutherford, N.J., that carried the Nets to 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley, finally recovered from a virus, had 33 points and 17 rebounds 
to keep the 76ers from being routed. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 105, Phoenix -- Akeem Olajuwon came out of a mild slump at Houston and 
the Rockets ended a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Olajuwon had 25 points and 20 rebounds and blocked nine shots. It was the big 
center's third game this season in which he had at least 20 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 118, Sacramento 103 -- Last Friday night at Oakland, the Warriors 
built a 13-point lead on the Kings, then blew the game. 
</P>
<P>
In this game at Sacramento, the Warriors built a lead and expanded it. They 
went on to win their first road game after nine defeats. DAN HAFNER

DISMISSED COACH HARBORS NO ILL WILL TOWARD PENGUINS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the better part of three weeks Gene Ubriaco was pushed and pulled, tugged 
and shoved, before finally being dropped by the Pittsburgh Penguins a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
But he said recently that he harbors no ill feelings about the situation, nor 
does he regret any of the decisions he made in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't do anything differently," Ubriaco said from his Cockeysville, Md., 
home. "Tony (Esposito, former Penguins general manager) and I came into a 
situation that was very negative. We thought we could win and we did win. Last 
year was one of the best seasons they've ever had in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of that good season, 14 guys got new contracts," Ubriaco said. "There 
was a power struggle off the ice and I believe it was there before we even got 
there. It spilled onto the ice, and we lost some games." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the Penguins were 10-14-2 when the ax fell last Tuesday, but the team had 
won five of nine before that. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told even after I left that had I stayed we would have won our share of 
games," said Ubriaco, who last year led Pittsburgh (40-33-7) to the Patrick 
Division finals for the first time. "They just said, 'We want to go in another 
direction.' " 
</P>
<P>
Ubriaco said that he felt the move was coming several weeks ago, but that when 
the team began winning again he felt a false sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they were going to let us handle it," Ubriaco said. "I was told the 
inmates weren't going to run the asylum." 
</P>
<P>
Ubriaco said he believed Esposito, who was hired as vice president and general 
manager April 14, 1988, was never in jeopardy. Eventually they both went as 
owner Edward DeBartolo Sr. cleaned house. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the organization was building toward something that meant 
something," said Ubriaco, who was made coach of the Penguins on June 28, 1988. 
"But it's like a banana republic. Some teams just operate that way. Somewhere 
along the line you have to support the people who work for you. But we lost 
that support like a lot of others had." 
</P>
<P>
A change in management is nothing new in Pittsburgh. It's more like a way of 
life. 
</P>
<P>
In the Mario Lemieux era of higher hockey in Steel Town, Bob Berry, Pierre 
Creamer and Ubriaco have come and gone as coaches and Ed Johnston and Esposito 
have disappeared from the general manager's seat. Craig Patrick, who used to 
run the New York Rangers, temporarily took over both roles last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The media never accepted me there because of my relationship with Tony," said 
Ubriaco, a childhood friend of Esposito's. "They would never let me live that 
down. But I know I got the job on the strength of my credentials. He wanted 
someone he knew but who was also qualified." 
</P>
<P>
Ubriaco said he felt badly for Esposito. 
</P>
<P>
"The team made money for the first time last year," Ubriaco said. "In fact, it 
made a lot of money. Tony was a good leader and a strong hockey man." 
</P>
<P>
When people first started calling for Ubriaco's ouster, Esposito gave him a 
vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him if it was going to mean his job that I'd go," Ubriaco said. "But 
I'll never forget Tony telling me, 'I'm going to do what is right,' and he said 
that firing me wasn't right. We stood firm and gained respect." 
</P>
<P>
But they now have their self-respect while standing in the unemployment line. 
</P>
<P>
Ubriaco said that much of the trouble stemmed from the players and their 
backlash to the media and management. 
</P>
<P>
Ubriaco said many players were more interested in personal achievement than 
team goals. 
</P>
<P>
"All those guys wanted was ice time," Ubriaco said. "That's what they loved the 
most because that's what brought the stats. Most of these guys never got 
rewards for team stats because there was never a team. They worried about 
individual stats because that's what they got paid for. They couldn't get it 
from the playoffs because they had never made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Trying to get them to think of team goals was like trying to teach a shark 
table manners." 
</P>
<P>
Ubriaco refused to blatantly attack Lemieux or teammate Paul Coffey as 
instigators in the battles waged. He would only say that the differences 
between Lemieux and Gretzky are much more than their point totals might 
indicate. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the beauty of this game that the true personality shows through," 
Ubriaco said. "When you go out on that ice, your character shows through loud 
and clear. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get on that ice you want to win and you want to get the (Stanley) 
Cup," Ubriaco said. "That should supersede everybody's personal interests. In 
some cases, it just doesn't."

FIVE TRACKS CANCEL PROGRAMS

<TEXT>
<P>
Five thoroughbred tracks canceled their programs Tuesday because of high winds 
and other adverse weather on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
A power outage at Rockingham, N.H., forced cancellation at that track, and gale 
force winds in the 50 m.p.h. range pushed the Philadelphia Park program back to 
today. 
</P>
<P>
High winds also knocked out Tuesday night's racing at the Meadowlands, along 
with the daytime card at Laurel, Md., and Finger Lakes (N.Y.) Race Track 
canceled its program because of frozen conditions.

JACK SMITH: ON SINKING DEEPER INTO THE MIRE OF PAST MISTAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"As usual," writes David S. Robinson, "when you write a column relative to an 
error you have made, you manage to just sink deeper in the mire." 
</P>
<P>
He refers to my recent mea culpa on the misspelling of dessert as desert, from 
which I leaped into a dissertation on the homonym and its sisters, the 
homophone and the homograph. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, he questions my implication that using a word as its homonym is a 
detectable error, a homonym being a word that is pronounced and spelled like 
another, but has a different meaning: e.g., a pitch in baseball, black as pitch 
(the example I gave.) 
</P>
<P>
"How is the reader supposed to know if a mistake has been made?" he asks. "That 
would seem to require a display of mind reading. That would be the last thing 
for you to suggest. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Saul Epstein is similarly perturbed. "How do you know?" he asks. "I have 
trouble in coming to grips with even the possibility of a person substituting a 
word for its homonym." 
</P>
<P>
Both are quite right. The misuse of pitch (baseball) for pitch (tar) is most 
improbable. And if the words are spelled the same and pronounced the same, how 
could any such unlikely error in print (or speech) be discovered? 
</P>
<P>
However, as I did point out, homonym is used synonymously with homophone, a 
word that sounds like another but has a different spelling and meaning. Thus, 
piece is incorrect when peace is meant. This kind of error is the most common 
made by otherwise literate writers. 
</P>
<P>
It would be impossible to say whether anyone has used pitch when he should have 
used pitch, but readers continue to send me examples of misused homonyms 
(homophones) from this newspaper and others. 
</P>
<P>
Among the recent crop: "these incidences will be eliminated;" "Griffith Park 
would be adversely effected"; "the affects of alcohol"; "the site of so many 
people in tuxedos"; "a barge-mounted crain"; "infrared censors"; 
"midriff-bearing tops"; "wiping out the precedence of almost two decades"; "he 
bares no malice"; "found themselves emersed"; "a backhanded complement"; 
"loathe to undertake"; "a clear breech of journalistic independence"; "not 
adverse to an occasional short holiday"; "pouring over the numbers"; "drilling 
cites"; "graduates hoards of illiterates"; "with momentos of the occasion"; 
"Suspect caught after week on lamb." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Titus writes that she was "shocked" by my misspelling of dessert. "Most 
any former school teacher can tell you the method to remember the difference 
between these two words. The ss in dessert stands for strawberry shortcake and 
the s in desert stands for sand." 
</P>
<P>
Avalee Nichols of Coronado says she phoned the San Diego Union to point out 
that she found "sounding brass and tinkling symbols" in a George Will column 
and that an editor told her "I don't presume to correct George Will." 
</P>
<P>
Far be it from me, also, to correct George Will, but I would have thought that 
cymbals clanged and bells tinkled. 
</P>
<P>
John A. Cloes challenges my listing of straightjacket as an erroneous homonym 
for straitjacket. He notes that Webster's gives straightjacket as a variant. 
Correct. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, readers had fun. Joseph Ansen recalls the perhaps apocryphal family 
story about an aunt who ran an antiques shop but refused to stock any items 
dating from before the Civil War. He says, "We never could find out what made 
auntie anti-antebellum." 
</P>
<P>
Roland D. Hutchinson of Sun City, psychology professor emeritus of Cal State 
L.A., says my mention of to, two and too moved him to write his first limerick 
since high school: 
</P>
<P>
 Three trains to old Kathmandu 
</P>
<P>
Had choices exceedingly few. 
</P>
<P>
One switched to track One, 
</P>
<P>
Another to Two; 
</P>
<P>
The third had to go to Two too! 
</P>
<P>
William Haines of El Segundo offers what he calls the ultimate homophone -- a 
word with four different spellings and meanings and one pronunciation: Right, 
write, rite and wright. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, Cloes points out that there is no way in the English language to 
say that there are three twos -- (tos, toos?). (We can say there are three 
words that are pronounced tew.) 
</P>
<P>
And there's only one way to pronounce pitch -- whether it's wild or black as 
tar.

* Way to San Jose: Imelda Marcos, the former Philippine First Lady, showed up 
at a dinner party in San Jose, Calif. In a restaurant owned by her former 
palace caterer, Del Garcia, Marcos quaffed champagne and dined on Swedish 
meatballs. After dinner, she joked, "They found in my closet many shoes, but at 
least it wasn't skeletons. They (the shoes) are a symbol of how much the 
Filipinos love me." Marcos, charged with investing $168 million worth of stolen 
funds in the U.S., is scheduled for trial in February.

* Kitty Kelley Christmas: The unauthorized biographer of Jackie, Frank, Liz and 
soon Nancy has sent out her holiday greetings. The card shows a fortuneteller 
with a Nancy-like woman. The book will reveal "all your deepest secrets," the 
seer says to her cowering client. Inside, the Nancy look-alike, seen near a 
tree decorated with dollar bills, is wearing a button that reads, "Just Say 
Dough."

* Raisa in the Sun?: Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev won a weeklong island 
vacation for two from the Paris Fashion Designers Assn., a reward for his 
"elegant style of living and working." But he was not able to accept in person. 
At the group's awards banquet Monday night in Paris, adviser Vladimir 
Federovski stood in. He said Gorbachev was "very touched." He didn't say what 
Raisa and Mikhail will do with the prize, which includes a trip to the chic 
Indian Ocean island of Mauritius. 
</P>
<P>
* Christmas Bush: This year's White House Christmas card depicts the 
snow-covered presidential mansion draped in greenery, with a wreath and red bow 
at the Truman Balcony. The message inside reads: "The President and Mrs. Bush 
extend their warmest wishes that Christmas and the New Year will hold much 
happiness and peace for you and those you love." The official White House tree 
is decorated with 80 soft dolls, each representing a character from books. The 
likes of Mary Poppins, Babar, the Mad Hatter and the Tin Man highlight Barbara 
Bush's commitment to literacy.

The Scene: An invitational screening of "Music Box," TriStar Pictures' new film 
about the trial of a suspected Hungarian war criminal (actor Armin 
Mueller-Stahl) and the defense presented by his lawyer daughter (Jessica 
Lange). Afterward, a group of 150 guests or so repaired to producer Irwin 
Winkler's home in Beverly Hills for a late supper. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: When a movie screens at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences in December, it usually means one thing: The producers hope that it 
will collect an Oscar or two in March. Guests at the event last weekend chatted 
about the possibility, and about the four different films with Holocaust themes 
that Hollywood will be putting in the Christmas stockings of theater 
exhibitors. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: "Music Box" stars Jessica Lange, Lucas Haas, Armin 
Mueller-Stahl, writer/executive producer Joe Eszterhas, and director Constantin 
Costa-Gavras; studio figures Dawn Steel, Alan Ladd Jr., John Landis, Mark 
Rydell, and Tony Thomopoulos; and actors Jacqueline Bisset, Tess Harper, Amy 
Irving, Shirley MacLaine, Martin Sheen, and Barbra Streisand. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: A general rule of thumb at these affairs: The more important one 
is, the more one can dress down. Guests wore everything from natty suits to 
jeans. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Ambrosia provided a pre-screening buffet, but the real dinner was served 
at Winkler's house by Spago's Wolfgang Puck: salmon, herb salad, lamb chops, 
lobster curry and dessert. A Hungarian string quartet played on the tented 
patio. 
</P>
<P>
Noted: Screenwriter Eszterhas, whose high-profile feud with agent Mike Ovitz 
has been the subject of intense Hollywood gossip for months, got the biggest 
hand of anyone when his credit flashed on screen at the beginning of the movie. 
Hollywood folks are so brave in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: So how will TriStar market a movie that opens on Christmas Day and 
doesn't feature aliens, ghostbusters, or Michael J. Fox? "Reviews," says 
producer Winkler. "We think we've got a chance to get some excellent reviews 
and hopefully some Academy Award nominations before we open wider around the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: "This is really an A party," guests kept saying at the Winkler house, 
happily surveying the number of powerful executives among them. It was indeed 
one of those lavish affairs that prove that author Jackie Collins isn't a 
novelist, but a documentarian. 
</P>

Glitches: Some of the Winkler's neighbors were having a party of their own 
complete with tented back yard, band, and valet parking, and a few confused 
guests pulled up to the wrong house. Just another Friday night in Beverly

ROTATOR CUFF INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Anyone who follows sports for any length of time soon becomes as 
interested in the hospital reports as in the statistics of the game. At some 
time or other, it seems that every professional ball player is going to have an 
injury, and one of the most popular ones today is the rotator cuff injury. Why 
do so many ball players in so many different sports have a problem with this? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: There is some disagreement about whether rotator cuff injuries occur 
because of some congenital problem or simply result from overuse. The injury 
occurs in all athletes who repeatedly use an overhead arm motion: baseball 
players, football quarterbacks, tennis players and swimmers.

SCREEN STYLE: HIGH FASHION ON MTV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The video: Tina Turner's "Steamy Windows" from the "Foreign Affair" album on 
Capitol Records. 
</P>
<P>
The look: Unlike her usual slashed and slit, heavy-leather outfits, Turner 
shows up in a classic strand of pearls, a white slip dress and a pair of 
spike-heel pumps. She leaves the Mad Max motor bikes behind too; instead, she 
struts her ample stuff across a horizon-less plane of white light. Tossing a 
mane of bronzed hair, she bares her remarkable legs almost completely, and 
manages to twist and shout across the stage with her mini-modestly remaining 
intact. It's a high-fashion music video, one of the rare sort associated with 
big-name print photographers and high-rent fashion magazines. The simplicity of 
the visuals is a test of Turner's ability to hold the screen without the 
trappings and costume flappings that lesser chanteuses seem to relish. She 
definitely makes the grade. 
</P>
<P>
The stylist: Kim Bowmen, fashion editor of Blitz, a forward British fashion 
publication, takes only partial credit for Turner's Ms. Clean look. She passes 
most of the accolades along to the video's director, Andy Morahan. "He is very 
well informed about fashion; his wife is a stylist. So he was quite succinct 
about the fashion content," Bowmen said. 
</P>
<P>
The labels: Turner gives a single-note fashion show in a very short, white 
dress with an overlay of pearl-beaded gold net, designed by Paris-based 
Azzedine Alaia. Background fashions on supporting vocalists and dancers are 
also by Alaia. The men's suits are by Katharine Hamnett with an occasional Jean 
Paul Gaultier garment thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
The stores: All the Alaias came from one resource: Tina Turner's closet. "She 
lent her own clothes to the models and dancers who worked on the shoot," said 
Bowmen. "I don't think I've ever worked with a star who did that." As for the 
keynote dress, that was chosen by Alaia and Turner, a team Bowmen called "the 
holy duo. They have a language barrier: She doesn't speak French and he doesn't 
speak English, so they just gaze admiringly at each other." There is an Alaia 
boutique in Beverly Hills. The Hamnett suits and the Gaultier fill-ins were 
provided by the Katharine Hamnett boutique in London. In Los Angeles, Maxfield 
carries both labels. 
</P>
<P>
The adaptation: Bowmen, who has worked on music videos for Brian Ferry and 
INXS, says a common mistake in many videos is to subject the star to the 
fashion fantasy. Models and dancers can pull off the look, she says, but very 
few others can make the leap into fashion wonderland. Turner recognizes the 
difference between screen style and street style. The clothes that cling and 
creep up her thighs are reserved for show time. 
</P>
<P>
The payoff: When Turner was 40 years old, she looked better than most 
performers half her age. Now that she has turned 50, it still holds true. She 
should be an inspiration to anyone who laments the passing of youth. Hers is 
the way to age gracefully. GAILE ROBINSON

PASADENA LOADED WITH GIFTS FROM ORDINARY TO SUBLIME

<P>
Holiday shoppers with a streak of hometown pride can wrap up an array of 
indigenous -- and sometimes ingenious -- presents from local artisans and 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The possibilities range from an $80 keg of Pasadena-brewed beer to a scented 
book of Victorian poems from the Huntington Library to a $10 Tournament of 
Roses T-shirt sure to please any snowbound Iowans on the gift list. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some other possibilities: 
</P>
<P>
The Gamble House Bookstore (4 Westmoreland Place, Pasadena; (818) 793-3334) 
features books and gifts on the turn-of-the-century Arts and Crafts Movement, 
which has deep roots in Pasadena architecture. Luminous, richly colored glass 
ornaments cost $25. A replica of a 12-lily Tiffany floor lamp that casts a 
warm, golden glow sells for $5,895. 
</P>
<P>
For those on a tighter budget, $5 will buy a coloring book ("Children's 
Architecture in Pasadena"), while $6.95 will purchase "Mission Furniture: How 
to Make It." The Gamble House is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Wednesday through 
Sunday. It will be closed Dec. 18 to 22. 
</P>
<P>
Another arts and crafts shop is Tom Gardner's Gardner Woodcraft (2594 E. Walnut 
St., Pasadena, (818) 449-2594. Phone for appointment.) Gardner builds custom 
furniture from the period, using gleaming oak and mahogany. A replica of a 
dining room table designed by Frank Lloyd Wright costs about $9,000, and a 
mahogany "settle," or bench-like couch, costs $2,500 to $4,000. A wall sconce 
runs about $500. The pieces should be purchased only for those who are willing 
to settle for a rain check under the Christmas tree, however. Work time is 
about 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
For outdoor Arts and Crafts-style lights, consider Bob Tatosian's Arroyo 
Craftsman verdigris-and-glass lanterns. A six-inch model costs $145. The lamps 
are available at Historic Lighting (421 S. Myrtle Ave., Monrovia; open 9:30 
a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday; (818) 303-4899.) 
</P>
<P>
An impressive gift for a New Year's party host might be a 13 1/2-gallon keg of 
beer ($80) from Crown City Brewery, (300 S. Raymond Ave., Pasadena; (818) 
577-5548, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily) The choices include Mt. Wilson Wheat, a 
golden ale, and Father Christmas, a spiced ale. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first things to catch the eye in the Huntington Library Bookstore 
(1157 Oxford Road, San Marino; (818) 405-2141; 1 to 4 p.m. Tuesday through 
Sunday), is a poster-sized print of John James Audubon's "Iceland Falcons," 
priced at $22. The library has also printed its own 1990 wall calendars, which 
includes Audubon's "Birds of America," for $9.95. 
</P>
<P>
Fans of the camellia, of which the Huntington has a renowned collection, might 
like the set of four English-made wooden place mats decorated with brightly 
colored paintings of the waxy flowers ($32). For $14.95, nature buffs can learn 
more about local trees in Donald R. Hodel's "Exceptional Trees of Los Angeles," 
which includes an account of a 140-year-old grapefruit tree saved from 
demolition by a group of gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
Aficionados of women's history might enjoy "Ho for California! Women's Overland 
Diaries from the Huntington Library" ($14.95), or the $1.75 pink paperback "The 
Lady's Guide to Perfect Gentility," reprinted from an 1856 edition. 
</P>
<P>
Other volumes on sale include "Henry Huntington and the Pacific Electric, An 
Album," ($13.95). It recounts how Huntington, the tycoon who founded the 
Huntington Library and its museum and 150 acres of gardens in 1919, built what 
was billed as the world's largest streetcar system. The romantic may be tempted 
by "A Victorian Posy: Penhalingon's Scented Treasury of Verse and Prose," a 
sweetly perfumed book of Victorian poems and other writings ($17.95). For the 
young poets, there is the classic favorite "A Child's Garden of Verse" by 
Robert Louis Stevenson, with reproductions of the original 19th-Century 
illustrations by Jessie Wilcox Smith ($16.95). 
</P>
<P>
For a year's worth of pleasure, the weary shopper should consider giving a 
Huntington Library membership for Christmas, which entitles the recipient to 
perks like early admittance to plant sales and a 20% discount on bookstore 
purchases. Cost ranges from $35 for a basic one-year membership to $1,000 for a 
year as a benefactor entitled to special private receptions, tours and classes. 
</P>
<P>
Across town is another Pasadena-area institution: the Tournament of Roses 
Souvenir Shop (59 W. Del Mar Blvd., Pasadena; (818) 795-1312, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
daily). For those out-of-town relatives, there is a white cotton T-shirt with a 
brightly colored rose on its front ($10), a baseball cap ($12), or "Tournament 
of Roses: First 100 Years," a book chronicling the parade's history ($24.95). 
Seats to the parade run $21 to $30 and are available at Sharp Seating Co. (709 
E. Colorado Blvd., Suite 140, Pasadena; (818) 795-4171.) 
</P>
<P>
For indoor entertainment, tickets are available for the Juilliard String 
Quartet appearing Feb. 7 at the Ambassador Auditorium (300 W. Green St., 
Pasadena; 800-266-2378.) Prices are $19.50 to $22.50. Irish flutist James 
Galway and the Tokyo String Quartet appear April 19 ($36.50 to $39.50), and Mel 
Torme and Helen Reddy on April 24 and 25 ($24.50 to $27.50). 
</P>
<P>
For the theater crowd, the Pasadena Playhouse is selling tickets at $28.50 to 
$35 for "The Downside, the Bottom-Line Comedy With High Yield Laughter," 
playing now through Jan. 14. (39 S. El Molino Ave., Pasadena; (818) 356-PLAY.) 
</P>
<P>
For the plant lovers on your list, try Nuccio's Nurseries, growers of rare 
camellias and azaleas since 1935 (3555 Chaney Trail, Altadena; (818) 794-3383. 
Open 8 a.m to 4:30 p.m. Monday, Tuesday, Friday and Saturday. Favorites among

plants, which sell from $6 to $35, can be shipped virtually anywhere in the 
country, according to the proprietors. 
</P>
<P>
To the south, flickering white "sanctuary candles" ($2.25) and imported, 
glass-eyed Spanish statues of St. Gabriel ($136) are ready to be taken home to 
create a private shrine. They are available from the San Gabriel Mission Gift 
Shop (537 W. Mission Drive, San Gabriel; (818) 282-5191; 9:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. 
daily.)

<P>
A free gift for a budding scientist might be reservations for "visitor day" at 
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena. Reservations for 
the tours, offered twice a month , must be made four to six weeks in advance. 
Call (818) 354-8594. 
</P>
<P>
Those interested in an earlier era of travel could spend $62.95 on a four-car 
toy train set, or up to $11,000 for a 4 1/2-foot-long model of a working steam

OFFICE VACANCY RATE RISES TO 14%; LEASING SLOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The office vacancy rate in the San Fernando Valley edged up to 14% in the third 
quarter from 13% a year earlier, while leasing activity dropped 20%, according 
to Grubb &amp; Ellis Commercial Real Estate Services, a division of the San 
Francisco-based real estate company Grubb &amp; Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest contributor to the higher vacancy rate was the West Valley region 
that includes Canoga Park, Tarzana and Woodland Hills, where the rate was 19% 
during the quarter that ended Sept. 30. The report said the area has 
significant new office space, including the 250,000-square-foot Warner Gateway, 
and said some companies are leaving the West Valley for less expensive space in 
Calabasas, Agoura, Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
The East Valley region that includes Burbank, North Hollywood, Studio City and 
Universal City was the Valley's strongest market, with a vacancy rate of 9%, 
the report said. That area has benefited from growth in the entertainment 
industry, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Grubb &amp; Ellis also noted a decline in Valley office construction in the 
third quarter, to 2.37 million square feet under construction from 2.85 million 
a year earlier. And despite its high vacancy rate, the West Valley is the 
busiest building market with more than 1 million square feet of office space 
under construction.

A TALE OF 2 S&amp;LS; VALLEY FED, GLENFED COPE WITH NEW RULES; 
</P>
<P>
GLENFED: THE GIANT THRIFT IS THINKING OF SELLING ITS HOME-BUILDING UNIT TO 
MAINTAIN NEW FEDERAL CAPITAL LEVELS, EVEN THOUGH THE UNIT IS PROFITABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glenfed Inc., the giant savings and loan holding company in Glendale, is 
mulling whether to shed its home-building business -- even though the unit is 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Glenfed, with $25 billion in assets, is the parent of Glendale Federal Bank. It 
also has been building houses since 1971 through its Glenfed Development Corp. 
unit, an Encino-based concern that builds single-family houses, condominiums 
and apartments in Southern California by itself and through joint ventures. 
</P>
<P>
In Glenfed's fiscal year that ended June 30, the home-building unit contributed 
$26 million, or 14%, of Glenfed's $189 million in total pretax profit. Glenfed 
typically does not break out the financial results of each division, but it 
found Glenfed Development's showing so exceptional in fiscal 1989 that it 
touted the unit's profit in its annual report. 
</P>
<P>
But profitable or not, the home-building division has become a burden to 
Glenfed because of the federal government's new capital requirements for 
savings and loans that took effect last Thursday, said Norman M. Coulson, 
Glenfed's president and chief executive. So Glenfed is considering whether to 
sell the division, although no decision has been made, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new federal requirements are meant to force S&amp;Ls to raise their capital 
-- which includes cash and stockholders' equity, among other items -- as a 
percentage of their total assets so as to cushion the thrifts against future 
losses from bad loans. The idea is to avoid the enormous S&amp;L failures that 
the federal government is now bailing out. 
</P>
<P>
The requirements are designed to redirect S&amp;Ls' focus toward their basic 
business of making mortgage loans, and they make it difficult for S&amp;Ls to 
continue making direct investments in real estate and other businesses thought 
to carry higher risk. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the new rules mean Glenfed can no longer add its investment in 
Glenfed Development -- an amount the thrift does not disclose -- to the parent 
company's overall capital base, Coulson said. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Glenfed would still have Glenfed Development's assets on its 
books but not its capital. In that case, at least, Glenfed's overall 
capital-to-assets ratio would go down instead of going up, as the new law 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
"So it becomes an issue of whether you can make enough money" in home-building 
"to take that kind of hit away from your capital," Coulson said. At the moment, 
he said, Glenfed Development's profits are not sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Glenfed Development builds about 500 houses a year in various price ranges. In 
a recent newspaper advertisement, the division was selling Laguna Hills 
condominiums starting at $158,900 and single-family houses in West Covina that 
started at $469,900. 
</P>
<P>
Although Glenfed has made no decision on selling the home-building division, 
Coulson acknowledged that several entities have asked Glenfed about possibly 
buying the business. The outside parties, which were not identified, "have 
shown quite a bit of interest" in Glenfed Development, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, S&amp;Ls that have been unable to raise more capital, for example, 
by selling additional stock, have been reducing their assets to meet the new 
capital-to-assets rules. Two weeks ago Glenfed sold $350 million of loans, 
enabling it to satisfy the terms of the new law for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
But the capital thresholds are scheduled to climb even higher over the next 
five years, forcing Glenfed and other thrifts to find ways to continue raising 
their capital levels. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't meet those capital guidelines, we become a second-class financial 
institution," Coulson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UNDERSTANDING THE NEW S&amp;L REGULATIONS 
</P>
<P>
As part of the federal government's attempt to avoid another disaster in the 
savings and loan industry, last week regulations took effect forcing S&amp;Ls 
to raise their financial reserves as a cushion against future losses from bad 
loans. The rules require S&amp;Ls to meet various yardsticks. Listed below are 
some of the new rules and their key terms: 
</P>
<P>
Capital: Capital is generally counted by adding up an S&amp;L's total assets 
(loans, cash and investments) and subtracting its total liabilities (deposits 
and other borrowed money). The resulting figure is essentially a thrift's "net 
worth." 
</P>
<P>
Tangible Capital: This is an S&amp;L's capital minus its so-called "intangible 
assets." One type of intangible asset is "goodwill," the premium paid for a 
company above the value of all its individual assets. S&amp;Ls are now required 
to have tangible capital equal to 1.5% of total assets. 
</P>
<P>
Core Capital: This is a less stringent standard that allows a thrift to count 
both tangible capital, plus a certain amount of "supervisory goodwill," which 
is goodwill acquired in the purchase of another troubled S&amp;L. Thrifts are 
now required to have core capital equal to 3% of total assets. 
</P>
<P>
Risk-based Capital: Just another way of counting capital and assets, this 
requirement is designed to ensure that S&amp;Ls carry more capital for its 
assets that are deemed risky, such as junk bonds or unsecured commercial loans. 
S&amp;Ls must now maintain capital equal to 6.4% of risk-based assets.

A TALE OF 2 S&amp;LS; VALLEY FED, GLENFED COPE WITH NEW RULES; 
</P>
<P>
VALLEY FED: S&amp;L ADMITS RECEIVERSHIP COULD RESULT IF CAPITAL LEVELS CAN'T BE 
RAISED. MANY OF ITS PROBLEMS HAVE STEMMED FROM MOBILE HOME LOAN LOSSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Valley Federal Savings and Loan Assn., an ailing Van Nuys-based thrift, says it 
is failing to meet new government standards for capital reserves and admits it 
could ultimately be placed in receivership if it is unable to improve those 
capital levels. 
</P>
<P>
The admissions don't mean the S&amp;L is any more likely to be placed in 
receivership than 800 or so other institutions nationwide that don't meet the 
capital requirements put in effect last Thursday. But the disclosure, made in a 
quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, marked the first 
time the thrift acknowledged the most dire possibilities that could result from 
its troubled finances. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal President and Chief Executive Dan E. Nelms declined to comment 
on the filing. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Valley Federal's business problems have stemmed from recurring losses 
at its All Valley Acceptance Co. subsidiary (AVAC), which makes loans on mobile 
homes. And ironically, its attempts to end those losses have taken the biggest 
bite out of Valley Federal's capital -- which is essentially a thrift's assets 
minus its liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the thrift took a total of about $90 million in pretax charges 
against its third-quarter earnings -- $62 million of that because of AVAC. The 
conservative move, designed to write off Valley Federal's expected profits from 
mobile home loans, essentially meant the S&amp;L had to subtract a similar 
amount from its asset base, because those expected earnings had earlier been 
booked as assets. 
</P>
<P>
That cut severely into Valley Federal's capital, because an S&amp;L's capital 
essentially rises and falls with the amount of its assets. And as a result of 
those and other charges, Valley Federal also reported a net loss of $70.6 
million for the third quarter, compared with net income of $132,000 during the 
same period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal said in its quarterly SEC filing that it could start mending its 
problems by selling some branch offices. Such sales could help the S&amp;L by 
simultaneously reducing its total assets and raising its cash reserves, which 
contribute to capital. 
</P>
<P>
But the thrift has a long way to go to meet the tougher new capital 
requirements that took effect last Thursday. The requirements are designed to 
give thrifts a bigger cushion against losses and thus avoid a repeat of the 
government's current bailout of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal said in its SEC filing that it had about 68 cents in so-called 
tangible capital -- which excludes some non-cash assets that are included in 
broader capital measures -- for every $100 in assets as of Sept. 30, instead of 
the required $1.50 per $100. Meanwhile, the S&amp;L said it had $1.28 in 
so-called risk-based capital -- a different measure designed to take account of 
an S&amp;L's riskier assets such as unsecured commercial loans -- for every 
$100 in assets, compared to a requirement of $6.40. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal said that because of its capital shortfalls, the thrift must 
submit a business plan for improving its position to the Office of Thrift 
Supervision, a federal S&amp;L regulatory body. 
</P>
<P>
But Valley Federal warned that if it fails to meet the goals of such a plan, or 
the new capital rules in general, regulators might decide "to place the 
institution in receivership or take other drastic supervisory or enforcement 
action." 
</P>
<P>
Problems at AVAC weren't apparent before 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Before that time, AVAC was considered a thriving subsidiary of Valley Federal 
-- one whose executives were featured in a cheery photograph in the 1986 annual 
report, standing at sunset in front of several mobile homes. The report pointed 
out that AVAC's loan originations that year increased a whopping 64% to $263 
million from $160 million. 
</P>
<P>
The unit's business seemed like a sure bet. AVAC's mobile-home loans were 
mostly in then-booming states such as Texas and Colorado. After making loans, 
AVAC turned around and sold the loans -- bearing a much lower interest rate -- 
to investors, and agreed to continue doing the paper work and handling 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
The spread between the interest paid by the borrowers and the interest AVAC 
passed on to the investors who bought the loans paid for Valley Federal's 
servicing and contributed to the unit's earnings. AVAC converted the stream of 
income it expected from the loans into a principal amount and carried it on its 
books as an asset. 
</P>
<P>
But AVAC was no sure bet. Economic busts in Colorado and Texas led to much 
higher-than-expected rates of foreclosures and early payments of loans. That 
meant that the revenues from the loans diminished, while the division still had 
to cover loan-processing costs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Valley Federal wrote off $11 million in AVAC's expected profits. In 
1988, AVAC lost another $11.5 million and Valley Federal predicted that "AVAC 
will incur significant additional losses during 1989." 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal was right. Excluding the big $62-million write-off at AVAC in 
the third quarter, AVAC's operations lost $14.3 million in the nine months that 
ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Doing away with the AVAC problem hasn't been easy. In 1987, Valley Federal put 
the unit on the sales block but found no buyers. And other remedies, such as 
cutting down on new loans to stem losses, have been a two-edged sword. 
</P>
<P>
AVAC used to take care of repossession problems with the help of new loans. 
When AVAC repossessed a mobile home because the borrower defaulted, it sold the 
home to another individual buyer -- along with new financing. But to cut down 
on new loans, AVAC tried selling the repossessed mobile homes to dealers. As a 
result, AVAC didn't get as good a price and its losses on each repossession 
climbed higher than ever. 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal declined to comment on how successful its cost-cutting efforts 
at AVAC have been. But the recent SEC filing indicates that the thrift believes 
it won't be possible to cut enough to make the unit break even with its current 
business. The filing said AVAC would try to service other lenders' mobile-home 
loans for a fee to make use of what it called the unit's "existing servicing 
infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal predicted that until such fees start flowing in, "AVAC will 
generate modest operating losses." 
</P>
<P>
VALLEY FEDERAL S&amp;L AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
Valley Federal Savings and Loan, based in Van Nuys, recently has been troubled 
by losses from a subsidiary that makes loans on mobile homes. The savings and 
loan, founded in 1925, has 846 full-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
Total Assets, as of Dec. 31 (In billions): 1989* $3.2 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Net income (loss) In millions: 1989* [73.0) 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
* Assets as of Sept. 30, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
** For nine months ended Sept. 30, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UNDERSTANDING THE NEW S&amp;L REGULATIONS 
</P>
<P>
As part of the federal government's attempt to avoid another disaster in the 
savings and loan industry, last week regulations took effect forcing S&amp;Ls 
to raise their financial reserves as a cushion against future losses from bad 
loans. The rules require S&amp;Ls to meet various yardsticks. Listed below are 
some of the new rules and their key terms: 
</P>
<P>
Capital: Capital is generally counted by adding up an S&amp;L's total assets 
(loans, cash and investments) and subtracting its total liabilities (deposits 
and other borrowed money). The resulting figure is essentially a thrift's "net 
worth." 
</P>
<P>
Tangible Capital: This is an S&amp;L's capital minus its so-called "intangible 
assets." One type of intangible asset is "goodwill," the premium paid for a 
company above the value of all its individual assets. S&amp;Ls are now required 
to have tangible capital equal to 1.5% of total assets. 
</P>
<P>
Core Capital: This is a less stringent standard that allows a thrift to count 
both tangible capital, plus a certain amount of "supervisory goodwill," which 
is goodwill acquired in the purchase of another troubled S&amp;L. Thrifts are 
now required to have core capital equal to 3% of total assets. 
</P>
<P>
Risk-based Capital: Just another way of counting capital and assets, this 
requirement is designed to ensure that S&amp;Ls carry more capital for its 
assets that are deemed risky, such as junk bonds or unsecured commercial loans. 
S&amp;Ls must now maintain capital equal to 6.4% of risk-based assets.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: PROMENADE MALL IN WOODLAND HILLS SOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Promenade Mall in Woodland Hills has been sold for an undisclosed price to 
a New York investor group. 
</P>
<P>
The 600,000-square-foot mall, which is anchored by Saks Fifth Avenue, Bullocks 
Wilshire and Robinson's, was sold by Pan-American Properties to Shopping Center 
Associates. Included in the sale were the Laguna Hills Mall in Orange County 
and six community shopping centers in California, Arizona and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Pan-American, which announced in July that it would sell the properties, is a 
real estate investment trust owned by pension funds for British coal miners. 
Shopping Center Associates includes The O'Connor Group, a property development 
and management firm, and The Retail Property Trust, a real estate partnership. 
</P>
<P>
Paul F. Kastner, vice president of marketing for the O'Connor Group, said it 
was too early to discuss what changes are planned for the Promenade Mall. But 
he said the mall's vacancy rate was too high and "that's something we'll 
address very quickly." He declined to specify the vacancy level.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: STUDY FINDS HIGH RATIO OF JOBS TO POPULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley has more jobs available relative to its population than 
Los Angeles County as a whole, according to a study by the Valley Industry and 
Commerce Assn., a business trade group. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley has 470 jobs for every 1,000 residents, or 13% more jobs per 
population than the 417-per-1,000 ratio for the county, the group said. As 
recently as 1982, the Valley's ratio trailed Los Angeles County's by 12%, VICA 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley overall has a population of 1.3 million and 38,590 business 
establishments employing 595,000 people -- with 76% of the businesses employing 
10 workers or less, the group said. Business employment jumped 36% between 1982 
and 1986, more than triple the 11% gain in the county. 
</P>
<P>
The figures are based on data from 1986 through 1989, depending on what 
information was the most recent available, VICA said.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: CIBA-GEIGY PLANS TO SELL STAKE IN 3D SYSTEMS INC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ciba-Geigy, a major Swiss corporation, said it plans to sell its 37% stake in 
3D Systems Inc. in Valencia as part of a restructuring program. 
</P>
<P>
Ciba-Geigy bought its interest in 3D Systems in July, 1988, for $30 million. 3D 
Systems makes a machine that uses lasers, chemicals and a computer to rapidly 
produce models of parts, consumer packages and other products for 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, it appeared that Ciba-Geigy would complement 3D Systems' need for 
lasers and chemicals because it also owns Spectra-Physics, a San Jose company 
that is the biggest U.S. laser producer. But Ciba-Geigy also announced plans to 
sell Spectra-Physics as part of its effort to cut its electronics-related 
businesses and focus on chemicals, drugs and agricultural products.

NOTEBOOK: AGOURA ALREADY MATCHES UP WITH MARMONTE TEAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's never too early to make a statement. Ask Kevin Pasky, whose Agoura 
basketball team has one more season in the Frontier League before venturing 
into the Marmonte League. Of course, the step up means no more twice yearly 
meetings with powerful Santa Clara -- but, top to bottom, the Marmonte is 
undoubtedly tougher than the Frontier. 
</P>
<P>
That is why Agoura's early-season wins over Camarillo, Newbury Park and 
Thousand Oaks and a loss to Westlake -- all members of the Marmonte League -- 
mean far more than a surprising 3-1 mark. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the season, that was what we talked about," said Pasky, who is in his 
third year. "We wanted to make a statement that we're a good basketball team 
and that the kids play hard. We want everybody . . . to know when we play, we 
play hard." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Southern Section, Agoura's enrollment of 1,900 students will 
rank fifth in the eight-team Marmonte. Newbury Park, as any Panther coach will 
be more than happy to tell you, is last with 1,540. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Agoura still has that reputation as a small 2-A school," Pasky said. 
"It's one thing I've had to do since I got here three years ago, and that's 
change the attitude within the program as far as being a small school." 
</P>
<P>
Runnin' wild: Greg Hess decided during the off-season that this version of his 
Westlake basketball team needed to run and push the ball into the attacking 
zone. What he didn't know was that he was taking his life into his hands by 
doing it. Or that hockey goalie gear would be mandatory at his games. 
</P>
<P>
In St. Monica tournament victories over Cathedral and Crossroads, the Warriors 
turned the ball over a combined 66 times. The play was especially ragged 
against Cathedral, which itself committed 27 turnovers -- 20 via Westlake 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
"Balls were bouncing off walls. People in the front row were wearing helmets," 
Hess said, laughing. "I had my son with me, and I had him sit behind me so I 
could protect him. 
</P>
<P>
"I wondered, 'Who's coaching these guys?' " 
</P>
<P>
The solution? 
</P>
<P>
"Mistakes make you pay," said Hess, who meant that mistakes make you run laps 
around the gym. "It's negative reinforcement." 
</P>
<P>
Home is where The Park is: Newbury Park has found a home in the Nordhoff 
tournament, a preleague affair at which the Panthers have done well recently, 
including tournament championships this season and last. 
</P>
<P>
This year, point guard Tim Lane was the most valuable player, and Chris Falzone 
and Joe Smigiel were selected to the all-tournament team. First-year Coach Greg 
Ropes said he'd return to the Ojai school to defend the title and likely would 
make it an annual affair. 
</P>
<P>
"As our enrollment declines," Ropes said, "we won't get out of the Nordhoff 
tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Post man: Ray Velasquez wants the ball -- and he wants it now! 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez, a 6-foot-4, 260-pound senior center for Burroughs, relishes hitching 
his frame to the low post, planting his powerful legs, raising his left arm and 
shouting, "Here! Here!" as a teammate dribbles the ball. 
</P>
<P>
And when he gets the ball, he knows what to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
Velasquez, who transferred from Hoover this season, has scored a team-high 130 
points in six games (21.6 average), including a 36-point performance against 
St. Francis in the Burbank-Hoover tournament. Velasquez, who was selected the 
tournament's most valuable player, also can shoot from the outside, having made 
10 of 16 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the one guy that's been consistent for us," said Coach Ira Sollod, whose 
team has dropped three in a row after a 3-0 start. 
</P>
<P>
And on the seventh day. . . . : Antelope Valley played five games last week, 
losing to La Canada, then sweeping four games en route to the championship of 
the Cerritos-Gahr tournament. The Antelopes (5-2) played Tuesday, Wednesday, 
Thursday, Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave them Sunday off," Coach Skip Adams said as a wisecrack. 
</P>
<P>
Rebounding victory: Moorpark pulled off an incredible rally Monday night in a 
nonleague game against visiting Mary Star, erasing a 26-point deficit in the 
final 12 minutes to win, 65-55. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the most incredible game that I've ever been a part of," first-year 
Coach Tim Bednar said. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 44-18, with 4:18 to play in the third quarter, Moorpark's Toussaint 
Powdrill and an opponent were ejected for fighting. The incident, however, 
ignited the Musketeers (3-3), who outscored Mary Star, 47-11, the rest of the 
way. "You never want to encourage that," Bednar said of the ejections. "And I 
sat my team down and got mad at them. We decided to channel that energy." 
</P>
<P>
Court sense: To the delight of Coach Greg Hilliard, Harvard replaced the 
10-year old rubber floor on its basketball court with a traditional wood one 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"The sound of squeaking feet is back," he said. "It just isn't basketball 
without that. Every year we'd have players with shin splints and sore knees. I 
think it had an effect on how we played at the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Sneak preview: City Section basketball fans wanting more than one match-up 
between North Hollywood and Grant, two of the area's finer teams, may not have 
to wait until their Jan. 17 league game. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers and the Huskies are in opposite brackets of the North Hollywood 
tournament that begins Thursday. Provided both teams win their two preliminary 
games over lesser opponents, a preview of the league showdown between the 
unbeaten teams will take place Saturday night. "It's something we're aware of 
and we'd like to face them," North Hollywood Coach Steve Miller admitted. 
</P>
<P>
His counterpart was more cautious. "We have to get by a good Bell-Jeff team and 
then either Reseda or Granada Hills first," Grant Coach Howard Levine said.

It's tournament time in Glendale, a great opportunity for Coach Brian 
Beauchemin to schedule a few patsies for the Glendale College basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Beauchemin, however, has gone grinch on his Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-team, double-elimination tournament begins tonight with seven of 
participants sporting records over .500. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley (10-2), ranked 12th in Southern California by the JC Athletic 
Bureau, plays fourth-ranked Compton (9-2) tonight at 6 p.m. and Glendale (6-5) 
plays East Los Angeles (5-7) at 8 in first round games at Glendale College. 
</P>
<P>
College of the Canyons (5-5) plays 10th-ranked Los Angeles Harbor (10-4) and 
13-ranked Valley (6-3) meets sixth-ranked Cypress (8-1) in other first-round 
games Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a well-stocked tournament," Beauchemin said. "I expect every game to be 
knock down, drag out." 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley is coming off a championship performance in last week's Golden 
West tournament where the Marauders dealt Cypress its only defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley is led by freshman point guard Dedan Thomas, the catalyst for 
the Marauders' up-tempo offense. He averages 12.3 points and 10 assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale is sparked by a quartet of sophomores that includes guard Bruce Heicke 
(16 points per game) and forwards David Swanson (16), Justin Lord (15.5) and 
Gary Fowler (14.5). 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore guard Steve Valenzuela (18 points) and forwards Larry Albritton (17) 
and Aaron Clark (17) are Canyons' top scorers. 
</P>
<P>
Shelton Boykin, a transfer from Texas-El Paso, is the key player for Valley, a 
team which features a number of talented sophomores, including Steve Ward, 
Cliff Barnes and Shawn DeLaittre -- none of whom played for Valley last season. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't gelled," Valley Coach Jim Stephens said. "We have a lot of 
sophomores, but this is the first year they've played together." 
</P>
<P>
Second-round games will be played Friday with the championship round to be 
played Saturday.

<P>
A former Cal State Northridge football coach and three former Matador players 
are participating in the newest attempt to export American sports to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Elway, who coached at CSUN from 1976-78, has been hired as a coach in the 
International League of American Football, an eight-team circuit scheduled to 
begin play April 14. Mike Kane, Chris Parker and Ron Foster are among 140 
players who participated in the league's mini-camp in Dallas last week. 
</P>
<P>
The ILAF plans to integrate American players with Europeans and gradually 
expand football in an area where the sport is in its infancy. Each team will 
have 12 Americans on its roster, and they must play the so-called skill 
positions of quarterback, running back, wide receiver, defensive back and 
linebacker. The remaining 24 players on each team will be recruited from each 
franchise's home nation. 
</P>
<P>
The league's long-term plan is to phase out the Americans, a goal Commissioner 
Carroll Huntress believes is attainable in seven to eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Elway, Parker and Kane already are veterans of European football. Earlier this 
year, Kane played running back for the Elway-coached Milano Seamen, who 
finished 13-2 and reached the Italian Super Bowl. In 1988, Kane led the 
Helsinki Roosters to the Eurobowl title. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, a quarterback, helped the London Capitals to the semifinals of the 
European Football League's postseason tournament in 1988. Parker spent most of 
last summer with the Rams, but was released during the final week of training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, Kane and Parker were invited to the Dallas mini-camp after a tryout at 
St. Bernard High last month. 
</P>
<P>
"The night before the tryout my mother got a call from one of the coaches (Ray 
Willsey) asking me to come to the tryout," Parker said. "I didn't know who he 
was or how he got her number." 
</P>
<P>
The league held tryouts in seven U. S. cities, and evaluated more than 4,000 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches gathered us together on the first day and told us we should feel 
special that we're here," Parker said. "Each coach thinks the level of play is 
at a high level, and it doesn't matter if we came from Northridge or Notre 
Dame. We're all in the same place now." 
</P>
<P>
The mini-camp roster includes many veterans of Arena Football and the 1987 NFL 
replacement games. Among the best-known players are Ben Bennett, formerly 
college football's all-time leading passer at Duke and Arena Football's Most 
Valuable Player in 1988, and Willie Totten, Jerry Rice's quarterback at 
Mississippi Valley State. 
</P>
<P>
The league's other head coaches include former Raider assistants Bob Mischak 
and Willsey, coach of Arena Football's L. A. Cobras in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Kane, 24, was a Division II first team All-American in 1986, after rushing for 
a school record 1,565 yards. He also holds CSUN career records for rushing 
(3,572 yards), touchdowns (39) and points (234). 
</P>
<P>
Parker, 25, established school records for completions (232) and passes (424) 
in a season, operating the Matadors' run-and-shoot offense in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, 26, anchored CSUN's secondary from his safety position in 1983. He 
started two games for the Raiders replacement team, but was released when the 
strike ended. 
</P>
<P>
Elway guided the Matadors to a 22-11-1 record in his three seasons before 
departing for San Jose State. With the Spartans, Elway was twice selected as 
Pacific Coast Athletic Assn. Coach of the Year and he compiled a 35-20-1 record 
from 1979-83. Elway spent the 1984-88 seasons at Stanford, guiding the Cardinal 
to a 25-29-2 mark. 
</P>
<P>
ILAF franchises are set for Barcelona, Helsinki, Munich, Milan, Rome, London, 
Amsterdam and Birmingham, England. The league has secured exclusive, multi-year 
contracts with some of Europe's largest stadiums, a departure from current 
European football. 
</P>
<P>
"Our home stadium in Milan had seats on just one side and it probably held 
1,500 people," Kane said. "Our biggest crowd was about 800." 
</P>
<P>
Milan's ILAF entry is slated to play in 32,000-seat Arena Stadium in 1990, 
before moving in 1991 to the 85,000-seat San Siro, which will be used for 
soccer's 1990 World Cup. Four ILAF stadiums have been main venues for the 
Olympics, while Montjuic Olympic Stadium will be the main venue for the 1992 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Football in Europe attracts crowds of up to about 10,000. Both the level of 
play and organization have been compared to American semi-pro leagues. 
</P>
<P>
The league plans to select its 96 American players by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
The ILAF may not be Europe's only football league for long. The NFL-sponsored 
World League of American Football plans on beginning play in the spring of 
1991, with franchises in the U. S., Canada, Mexico and Europe.

DIGEST: CROSS-COUNTRY SHUFFLE CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A plan that would expand the number of divisions and group the state's high 
schools equally among four categories at the state cross-country championships 
will be considered at the California Interscholastic Federation's Federated 
Council meeting Feb. 2 in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the new plan would divide the state's high schools into four 
divisions of equal size based on enrollment numbers. The realignment would take 
effect in the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
Under the present format, the state is divided into three divisions (I, II and 
III) for cross-country based on school enrollment with an unbalanced number of 
eligible schools in each division. 
</P>
<P>
For this year's state championships, Division I, in which there are 352 
schools, included schools with a student body of 1,600 or more students. 
Division II (700-1,599) had 315 schools and Division III (1-699) had 129. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new alignment, Division 1 (2,021 plus students) and Division 2 
(1,519-2,020) will each have 199 schools. Division 3 (939-1,518) and Division 4 
(0-938) would include 196 and 203 schools, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The current setup grants 63 schools (21 in each division) from 10 CIF sections 
a berth in the state championships. The four-division plan would allow 64 
schools participation in the state meet with 17 qualifying teams in Divisions 1 
and 2 and 15 teams in Divisions 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
Former Valley College Coach Dave Snow, now at Cal State Long Beach, leads a 
group of Southern California baseball coaches who are scheduled to appear at a 
coaching clinic Dec. 16-17 at Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic is open to all baseball coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduled speakers include former College of the Canyons Coach Mike Gillespie, 
now of USC, Chris Smith and Bill Gevitt of Loyola Marymount and Al Ferrer of UC 
Santa Barbara. Information: 213-642-3328. 
</P>
<P>
The Junior Elite Training Center gymnastics club of Canoga Park placed two 
teams in the California State Team Championship last weekend in San Diego. The 
JETC Level 7 junior (ages 12-14) squad placed first in the all-around 
competition with a team score of 107.40, and Emily Moyer, 15, of Chatsworth 
recorded the highest all-around score of 36.00. Heather Mitchell, 14, of 
Northridge placed second with a 35.65. 
</P>
<P>
The JETC Level 6 children (ages 9-11) all-around team finished third with a 
173.65, and fourth in the Level 7 senior (ages 15-18) division. 
</P>
<P>
Two weekends ago, JETC had three all-around champions at the California State 
Individual Meet at Eagle Rock High. 
</P>
<P>
Kristina Kasper, 10, of Hidden Hills won the Level 6 children all around with a 
score of 35.95. Mitchell, 14, scored a 35.60 to win the Level 7 junior 
all-around, and Krissy Zgrabik, 16, of Van Nuys won the Level 7 senior (ages 
15-18) all-around with a 35.10.

BILL BOYARSKY: AVOIDING THE MEDFLY DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An important part of a politician's routine is inspecting the damage after 
fires, floods, landslides or other disasters. 
</P>
<P>
I've followed them past burned houses and mud-filled yards, taking notes on 
their expressions of horror and sympathy and promises of assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Their words are predictable and likely to produce no results, and reporters 
feel stupid having to record them. But the attention of a President, a 
governor, a mayor or a county supervisor may bring temporary comfort to the 
victims. And the politician likes the publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Now we have a disaster the politicians avoid. It's the Mediterranean fruit fly 
-- and the resulting aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion on large areas 
of Southern Los Angeles and northern Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
It's been with us for weeks. Unlike the 1981 infestation, when then-Gov. Edmund 
G. Brown Jr. delayed spraying, this time it began quickly, over an 
89-square-mile area around Dodger Stadium and in the San Fernando and San 
Gabriel valleys. That didn't stop the Medfly. The spray area was expanded, and 
many more aerial sprayings are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are great. If those flies move over the Tehachapis, the huge 
agricultural business in the Central Valley will be threatened. There are 
political considerations as well. Agribusiness is a powerful force in state 
politics and its business allies in the Southland -- banks, food retailers and 
others -- have great clout in local affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups are opposed to the spraying. Although officials say the 
doses of the pesticide are comparatively small, opponents protest that 
malathion is especially damaging when there are frequent sprayings over a large 
residential area. These environmental groups have political power. 
</P>
<P>
With the political impact potentially so great, and emotions so intense, it is 
understandable that political leaders would be more cautious in dealing with 
the Medfly than when confronting a brush fire. 
</P>
<P>
Caution is fine. But not invisibility. 
</P>
<P>
Where's George Deukmejian? He favors the spraying. Why isn't he walking the 
streets of those San Gabriel Valley communities that gave him such handsome 
margins in 1986, telling them that malathion is a painful but perfectly safe 
and necessary medicine? 
</P>
<P>
What about Tom Bradley? Why hasn't he been in Echo Park or East Los Angeles, 
reassuring anxious constituents? The county supervisors have not been 
especially visible. 
</P>
<P>
Political pros have an explanation: Jerry Brown. He got mixed up with the 
Medfly when he was governor in 1981 and lost the Senate election the following 
year. The Medfly is a loser, they say. Stay away. Let the scientists handle the 
little devils. 
</P>
<P>
That's government by public opinion polling. It's a widely criticized practice, 
but elected officials seem to be following it. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's aides said he's leaving it in the hands of his agriculture 
department. I called Bradley's office to ask who was watching the spraying. The 
press secretary, Bill Chandler, didn't know, but said he'd get back to me. When 
he did, he said the Medfly was mainly a state and county agricultural 
department matter. Inquiries, he said, are sent over to the county. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't much satisfaction from two of the county supervisors whose 
districts include substantial parts of the sprayed areas in the San Gabriel 
Valley. Assistants to Pete Schabarum and Mike Antonovich said their bosses were 
letting state and county agricultural officials handle it. All three offices 
assured me they had had very few complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, as the spraying has increased, more public officials are speaking 
out. The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday asked the state to take another 
look at the spraying and examine alternatives. Supervisor Ed Edelman, who also 
represents sprayed areas, has wondered if the operation has gone too far. Other 
local officials and state legislators are getting concerned. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest opponent is the mayor of Monterey Park, Pat Reichenberg. The 
helicopters spray malathion over her hilltop cul de sac of one-story homes. She 
says most people in Monterey Park oppose the pesticide spraying. But 
Reichenberg and the others are not powers with a broad constituency, as are the 
governor, the mayor and the supervisors. They lack the authority of the 
governor and the supervisors over the spraying itself. And they don't have 
Bradley's ability to carry his message to many people. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back on it, history may find that Jerry Brown's personal conduct during 
the last Medfly invasion was quite admirable. He wasn't sure the pesticide was 
safe. So he delayed the spraying as long as he could. 
</P>
<P>
He may have been wrong. But he didn't hide behind agricultural officials. And 
if we didn't like it, at least we knew who to blame.

For a while it seemed like a race to see who would win the Municipal Grinch 
award: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Santa Monica, which has hung holiday banners festooned with seaweed and 
dolphins instead of Santa and reindeer, or, 
</P>
<P>
 -- Los Angeles, which recently wrapped City Hall in a fence topped by three 
rows of barbed wire. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. City Councilman Nate Holden, startled by the cellblock-spirit of the 
latter display, said Friday: "That fence is not going to stay up." 
</P>
<P>
And when the council met Tuesday, Holden demanded that the L.A. Wall be taken 
down, growling: "They're ripping down walls in Germany and all over the world, 
and here we are separating the citizens from our City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
But Holden, told by Recreation and Parks officials that a temporary fence was 
necessary to keep people from tripping over a landscaping project, agreed to 
drop the motion after he learned that the boughs of barbed wire had been 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
Fa la la la . . . 
</P>
<P>
There's no question that Monrovia is bursting with holiday spirit, judging from 
the display outside one of the city's intimate apparel shops. 
</P>
<P>
While the L.A. City Council was able to achieve a quorum Tuesday, there have 
been times -- as on one occasion last week -- when a session was canceled 
because not enough members were present. 
</P>
<P>
And even when enough lawmakers do show up, there are invariably a few 
stragglers that delay the start for 20 minutes or so. Snagged, no doubt, on the 
new barbed-wire fence. 
</P>
<P>
Dreamers who thought that the presence of cable television cameras would 
eliminate tardies were mistaken. Councilman Hal Bernson went so far the other 
day as to raise the possibility of fining the delinquents. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's time we started doing something," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the council's thrice-weekly TV show should be called, "The 
Late Show." 
</P>
<P>
Tardiness also has plagued the supervisors, inspiring Pete Schabarum to come up 
with an ingenious solution: Start the sessions half an hour later at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
But colleague Deane Dana, usually an ally, objected, reasoning: "You'd soon 
find we were starting at 10:20." 
</P>
<P>
And colleague Mike Antonovich, usually an ally, complained that a 10 a.m. start 
wouldn't leave the board enough time to accomplish its business. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum lashed back at Antonovich: "You don't show up at 9:30!" 
</P>
<P>
The motion failed, despite Schabarum's declaration that "I got better things to 
do than waiting around here for everyone to get their act together." 
</P>
<P>
Might we suggest a solution: Move the starting time from 9:30 to 10 a.m., but 
don't tell the supervisors.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WITNESS CHALLENGED IN CROSS-BURNING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The credibility of a key witness in a hearing for two fired deputies accused of 
burning a cross in Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail about two years ago 
was challenged Tuesday in the third day of testimony before a Civil Service 
Commission hearing officer. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Richard Shinee, who represents former jailers Brian Kazmierski and 
Richard Bolks in the appeal of their discharge, produced testimony alleging 
that a departmental witness, Deputy Frank Plass, once said that he hated 
Kazmierski and was out to get him. Two sheriff's deputies testified about the 
alleged remark. 
</P>
<P>
Plass testified earlier in the hearing that Kazmierski admitted that he had set 
fire to a cross in a section of the jail where members of the Crips, a black 
street gang, were housed. Plass was the senior deputy assigned to the floor 
where Kazmierski and Bolks worked. 
</P>
<P>
Floor Sgt. Patrick Weeks, who supervised Plass and the two accused deputies, 
said that when he investigated the cross-burning report he decided that a cross 
probably had been burned, and he transferred Kazmierski and Bolks. Now, he 
said, he is "not certain" a cross was burned.

TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Skid Row day-care center was evacuated and streets in downtown Los Angeles 
clogged with traffic when 30 gallons of ammonia spilled from a refrigeration 
tank Tuesday afternoon, city Fire Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The leak occurred about 5 p.m. from a malfunctioning tank belonging to Youngs 
Market Co. in the 600 block of Gladys Avenue. Most of the liquid became gas and 
dissipated into the air, officials said. But a nose-wrinkling odor enveloped 
two Skid Row blocks, leading school officials to evacuate 25 children from the 
Para Los Ninos day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
"The smell got so strong, just like a big laundry," said day-care center worker 
Wendy Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said no one was injured. Police blocked off 5th and 6th streets 
while firefighters mopped up the spilled liquid.

L.A. HIKES ITS OFFER TO KEEP RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC and KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Coliseum Commission on Tuesday increased the value of the new 
stadium it has promised to build Raiders owner Al Davis to $145 million, up $20 
million from its previous offer, in another bid to keep the football team here. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he would get back to us in the next few days," Coliseum Commission 
President Richard Riordan said after a meeting between Davis, representatives 
of the Spectacor Management Group which manages the Coliseum, Riordan and 
Coliseum Commissioner Dominic Rubiclava. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say I'm still a bit pessimistic (about Davis accepting the offer)," 
Riordan added. "But I think the odds against it have narrowed." 
</P>
<P>
The latest proposal is a variation on offers to Davis going back to last June. 
Most of the money for the project would come from private financing. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who in the past has expressed dissatisfaction with offers by Coliseum 
officials, currently is considering competitive offers that would move his team 
to Sacramento or back to Oakland, the city in which the Raiders originally 
played. 
</P>
<P>
As has been the case with all of the offers, Davis had no comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Riordan said that under the "very detailed" proposal to Davis on Tuesday, 
California would lease the land to MCA Inc., which would demolish most of the 
existing stadium, which was enlarged to its present size for the 1932 Olympics. 
Preserving only the peristyle end of the 95,000-seat Coliseum, Riordan said, 
MCA would build a new stadium, seating 60,000 to 70,000, "with state-of-the-art 
sight-lines and luxury boxes. . . . "It would be as nice as any stadium in the 
country," the commission president said. 
</P>
<P>
Riordan said that if Davis were to approve the offer with dispatch -- and the 
state agrees right away -- construction would begin after the team's 1990 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"If all went well, they'd miss the '91 season, but they'd be ready for '92," he 
said.

MENORAH IN CITY HALL SHINES LIGHT ON CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a newly arrived Soviet immigrant helping to lead the way, members of a 
local Jewish group marched and danced their way into Los Angeles City Hall on 
Tuesday to return a menorah holiday display banned for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Postolov, who arrived Sunday from the Soviet city of Tashkent, praised 
American freedom as he strained to maneuver the 250-pound brass candelabrum 
next to a 21-foot-tall Christmas tree in the center of City Hall's rotunda. 
</P>
<P>
As he stepped for the first time onto the rotunda's polished marble floor, 
little did Postolov know that he was walking into a continuing controversy that 
touches the very heart of U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
As the menorah installation ceremony took place, officials of the American 
Civil Liberties Union repeated their opposition to the display, contending that 
it violates the constitutional separation of church and state. It was an ACLU 
lawsuit that caused the menorah to be banned from the rotunda the last two 
holiday seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of other Jewish groups, which believe that a menorah display in a 
government building degrades the religious meaning of Hanukkah, promised to try 
to keep it out of City Hall next year. 
</P>
<P>
The return of the 200-year-old menorah to the rotunda was praised by leaders of 
a Westwood-based Jewish group that began loaning it to the city for public 
display in 1982. The menorah, which stood in a temple in Katowitz, Poland, 
until the Nazi invasion, now belongs to the West Coast Chabad. The group is a 
Jewish social services organization that aids Jewish Soviet immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Chabad leaders praised a 6-month-old state Supreme Court ruling that rejected 
the ACLU's contention that the menorah display violates the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"The American system of justice has worked," exclaimed Rabbi Boruch Shlomo 
Cunin, Chabad's director. "The Iron Curtain has parted in Europe, and it's 
parting at City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
Postolov, 37, said he fled the Soviet Union because Jews there are still not 
free to display menorahs or practice their religion openly. The one-time Soviet 
surgeon was accompanied at Tuesday's ceremony by his wife, Lucia, a 32-year-old 
pathologist, and their daughter Chana, 5. 
</P>
<P>
"You could not see this celebration in the Soviet Union. You didn't see Jews 
with smiles on their faces like you do here," Postolov said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 Jews clapped and danced to a Hebrew tune played on an electronic 
keyboard and a drum set as the menorah was carried into City Hall. But the 
ceremony did not bring smiles to the faces of some other Los Angeles Jews. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, all of the mainstream Jewish organizations in Los Angeles are of 
the view these symbols should not be on public property," said Douglas E. 
Mirell, regional president of the American Jewish Congress. "It's demeaning and 
debasing of the symbol in our view." 
</P>
<P>
Mirell said Jewish groups will try to persuade city officials to block the 
menorah display next year. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Sobel, an attorney for the ACLU, said her organization will inspect the 
City Hall menorah to determine "if it fits in the context of what the Supreme 
Court ruled was legal." If the display seems more religious than secular, her 
group may seek to have it removed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, whose council motion last week cleared 
the way for Tuesday's ceremony, said she views the City Hall menorah as a 
cultural artifact. Courts have previously ruled that Christmas trees are not 
religious symbols and the unlit rotunda menorah is the same, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's a better time than Christmas to call attention to the 
symbols of various ethnic groups," she said.

ACCORD ON HOUSING LEADS TO APPROVAL OF 2-TOWER COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council Tuesday voted 14 to 1 to approve the controversial 
$600-million, two-tower Watt City Center office and retail complex after a 
landmark agreement was struck requiring simultaneous construction of 80 housing 
units to replace those razed for the development. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur K. Snyder, a former councilman and now lobbyist for Watt and Merselis 
developers, said construction will begin next month. The 62-story and 27-story 
towers will total nearly 1.7 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The development between 7th and 8th streets is the first project within the 
Central City West district, a 314-acre area bordering downtown just west of the 
Harbor Freeway. Advocates of low- and moderate-income housing have viewed Watt 
City Center as a test of their demands for timely replacement housing. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like this is a great precedent -- any developer who builds in Central 
City West will have to do replacement housing when his project is occupied," 
said Father Philip Lance, an Episcopal priest and organizer of the 250-member 
United Neighbors of Temple Beaudry &amp; City West. "That is the message we 
wanted to send today." 
</P>
<P>
About 35 of the predominantly Latino neighbors quietly observed the two-hour 
council hearing and then paraded outside City Hall to demonstrate their housing 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Bodaken, an attorney for the Legal Aid Foundation who has represented 
the neighbors, told the council that a more vociferous protest was averted late 
Monday when the developers agreed to build the housing "up front." 
</P>
<P>
Snyder said the developer had hoped to delay work on the housing for about six 
months after occupancy of the first tower, but ultimately agreed to prepare the 
housing units for occupancy at the same time as the offices. He said land 
acquisition for the housing would begin immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Another major sticking point -- where to build the 80 new units -- was remedied 
by negotiations among the developer, the neighbors, and the offices of 
Councilman Gilbert Lindsay, in whose district the Watt City Center will be 
built, and Councilwoman Gloria Molina, in whose district Temple Beaudry 
neighbors have lost housing because of other developments. 
</P>
<P>
Developers are required to replace razed housing, and normally the new units 
are expected to be built where old ones were razed. Under this agreement, 
however, the 80 units will be built a few blocks away in the Temple Beaudry 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The city has had a moratorium on new projects in Central City West, pending 
adoption of a new development plan, which is now under consideration and 
includes housing and transportation proposals. Watt and Merselis sought an 
early go-ahead out of fear of losing promised financing. 
</P>
<P>
Bodaken emphasized that the developer has signed a "memorandum of 
understanding" to abide by the pending plan's housing element, even if it 
ultimately differs from what is now outlined. 
</P>
<P>
Molina, who called the development "an ideal project," said it will provide 
about $15 million in private funds for housing, and nearly $20 million for 
transportation, while producing taxes for local government. 
</P>
<P>
With the housing precedent negotiated and apparently pleasing all sides, the 
council concentrated its debate Tuesday on traffic concerns raised by 
Councilman Marvin Braude, who cast the lone vote against the project. 
</P>
<P>
Braude argued that the council should not approve any new project until it 
decides how to handle excess traffic in downtown Los Angeles. He said the Watt 
development would seriously overburden the Harbor Freeway, which he estimated 
already has 2,000 more vehicles per peak hour than it was built to serve. 
</P>
<P>
The developer had voluntarily withdrawn plans to build a 1,000-space garage for 
vans between the two towers in order to reduce the amount of new traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The city Planning Commission on Oct. 5 approved only a 27-story tower, denying 
immediate construction of the 62-story section. But Watt appealed, arguing that 
building only a small part of the development was economically unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
The council's Planning and Land Use Management Committee last week recommended 
approval of both towers. 
</P>
<P>
Without a unanimous vote, the project must come before the City Council for a 
second vote next week, but final approval appears certain.

LINDSAY CROSBY SUICIDE LAID TO END OF INHERITANCE INCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lindsay Crosby, the youngest son of Bing Crosby from the famed crooner's first 
marriage, shot himself to death in a Las Virgenes apartment after learning that 
the inheritance he relied on to support his family was gone, a family 
spokeswoman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Just 11 days earlier, Crosby and his three brothers had been told by attorneys 
that the oil investments their late mother, Wilma Wyatt, made for them had gone 
broke, said Marilyn Reiss, spokeswoman for Lindsay's older brother, Gary. 
</P>
<P>
For Lindsay, the news was the "last straw" after years of battling alcoholism, 
depression and the strain of living under the shadow of his famous father, 
Reiss said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe if he had been a meaner person, he could have handled it," Reiss 
reported Gary Crosby saying after learning of his brother's death. "He was too 
sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
Crosby, 51, was found dead late Monday afternoon from a single gunshot wound to 
his head. A small-caliber rifle was nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby had been staying at the apartment on Bravo Lane while undergoing 
treatment for alcoholism in nearby Calabasas, Reiss said. He was due to return 
home to his third wife, Susan, and two sons in Sherman Oaks this weekend, she 
said. Crosby had two other sons by previous marriages. 
</P>
<P>
Alcoholism was only one of many problems that seemed to dog Lindsay, Reiss 
said. He had a nervous breakdown in 1962, went through two divorces and was 
arrested several times for drunk driving and battery. 
</P>
<P>
He never held a steady job, and his own attempts at an entertainment career, 
including appearances in such low-budget films as "The Glory Stompers," and 
"Free Grass," were dismal failures. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Lindsay sided with his brother, Gary, who had written a book, "Going 
My Own Way," in which he described Bing Crosby as an abusive tyrant who beat 
his sons. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it clears up a lot of old lies," Lindsay said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Bing Crosby married actress Kathryn Grant in 1957 and raised a second family. 
At his death in 1977 at age 73, he left his money in a blind trust, which none 
of the sons -- whose youthful escapades were well documented by the news media 
-- could touch until age 65. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Crosby, another of the Crosby brothers, said in a magazine interview 
six years ago: "My father thought, 'How much trouble will they be able to get 
into then?' " 
</P>
<P>
Reiss said the recent glut in the oil markets wreaked havoc on Wyatt's 
investments. Gary Crosby told Reiss that the four brothers, who also include 
Dennis, Phillip's twin, were shocked. 
</P>
<P>
But he said for himself: "My life is one shock after another. I'll find a job 
as a backup singer, or a gofer on a studio lot." 
</P>
<P>
No one knew the depth of Lindsay 's despair -- except now, in retrospect, Reiss 
said.

FROM MOUTHS OF BABES, INSIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
PSYCHOLOGY: LOIS BARCLAY MURPHY HAS BEEN A STAR IN EXPLORING THE EMOTIONAL LIFE 
OF INFANTS AND CHILDREN. NOW 87, SHE IS STILL HARD AT WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1938, child psychologist Lois Barclay Murphy and her family drove from New 
York to California. 
</P>
<P>
At the Kansas border, they took a detour. Their 6-year-old daughter, Midge, 
knew the story of the Wizard of Oz and refused to enter the state of Kansas. 
She was not going to be blown away like Dorothy, she told her parents. She 
would get out of the car if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we could not truthfully guarantee that there would be no tornado in 
Kansas, and since it seemed a minor concession to make to a strong-minded child 
whom we respected, we changed the plan and drove through Nebraska," Murphy 
explains in the introduction to one of her many books on child psychology. 
</P>
<P>
Many parents -- and child psychologists -- might have taken a less 
understanding approach to a child's fears. But Murphy has spent her life 
observing, listening and trying to comprehend what goes on in the minds and 
hearts of infants, children and adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
"She has been a star in describing the vulnerability of children and the ways 
in which they can be hurt," said Lewis Lipsitt, director of the Child Study 
Center at Brown University. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy was one of the first to document feelings of sympathy in preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
"The head of the nursery school told me that the study was futile since she 
felt children that young didn't have any sympathy," Murphy recalls. 
</P>
<P>
But Murphy's study showed that even children as young as 2 could show caring 
for each other, comfort each other, defend each other from other children or 
warn each other about danger. 
</P>
<P>
She was also one of the first to measure the vulnerability of infants and young 
children to early problems. And before the word coping was a buzzword in the 
child-development literature, she conducted research to examine how some 
children manage to cope with stressful life circumstances, ranging from serious 
illnesses to moving. 
</P>
<P>
Now 87 ("I'm an old, old woman," she said recently, though neither her 
appearance nor her voice give her age away), Murphy is still hard at work and 
divides her time between an apartment in Washington and a house she designed in 
the New Hampshire woods. 
</P>
<P>
She writes regularly for "Zero to Three," a publication of the National Center 
for Clinical Infant Programs. She has just finished editing a book of 
scientific papers by her late husband, Gardner Murphy, also a noted 
psychologist who chaired Columbia University's psychology department before 
becoming director of research at the Menninger Foundation in Topeka. 
</P>
<P>
Her current project is a biography of Gardner, to whom she was married for 53 
years. She plans to finish the book next year. 
</P>
<P>
But what has earned her a place in the annals of psychological research is her 
fundamental belief in the importance of simply listening to children -- 
following their lead rather than imposing adult standards on them. 
</P>
<P>
"Childbearing then is not just a matter of taking care of the baby and the 
young child -- whether with a philosophy of permissiveness or of discipline -- 
but of supporting the child's efforts to take care of himself," she wrote with 
co-author Alice E. Moriarty in the book "Vulnerability, Coping and Growth." 
</P>
<P>
"We need to try to feel our way into the experience of the child, as the child 
feels and experiences it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy has spent her career investigating this premise. Along the way, she and 
her husband had a son and adopted a daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"Gardner was a feminist," she said. "He said before we got married, 'I want my 
wife to use her brains, and I don't want you to spend more than 20 minutes a 
day on the house.' I smiled to myself. But I didn't really work full time until 
my children were in college." 
</P>
<P>
She nevertheless managed to produce an extraordinary body of scholarship, 
including 16 books on child development and scores of papers. She has received 
numerous awards, including the Dolly Madison award of the National Center for 
Clinical Infant Programs. 
</P>
<P>
Her work also includes hundreds of black-and-white photographs that show 
children throughout the world just being themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In Nigeria, she captured a child confidently carrying another boy piggyback. 
She observed families in Tashkent, Soviet Union, in the 1950s. She studied 
foundlings in New York City, started and headed the first child-development 
center at Sarah Lawrence College and helped conduct one of the early landmark 
studies of infants and preschoolers at the Menninger Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of a Methodist-Episcopal minister, Murphy was born in 1902 in 
Lisbon, Iowa. Her great-grandfather was a pioneer and her grandfather was a 
state senator. 
</P>
<P>
"I was taught very, very young that as a Barclay with pioneer forebears, I was 
born to be a pioneer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She went to Vassar on scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother thought Vassar would make me into a lady. I was a mousy little 
bookworm and didn't fit the image of what my mother wanted in a daughter. She 
wanted someone glamorous." 
</P>
<P>
From Vassar, she moved on to Union Theological Seminary for a master's degree 
in theology, planning to teach comparative religion. Her college roommate 
introduced her to Gardner, who was teaching psychology at Columbia. They 
married a few years later. In the meantime, she had graduated and was teaching 
comparative religion at Sarah Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
She met the head of the Macy Foundation in New York and proposed studying 
sympathy in preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
"Do it and send me the bill," he told her. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting study not only became her doctoral dissertation at Columbia's 
Teachers College but was later published as a book and launched her career as a 
child psychologist. It remains a standard work in psychology. 
</P>
<P>
As she looks back half a century later, what gives Murphy the most pride and 
satisfaction is the work that she did with the Head Start program for poor 
children in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Most vivid of all in her memory are those children -- and their mothers -- who 
changed, who were able to grow and achieve something they never would have 
achieved without Head Start. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, she remembers one mother, dirty and disheveled and without hope. 
</P>
<P>
"We put her on a committee on Head Start," Murphy said. Her appearance began to 
change. The woman went back to school, got her high-school equivalency 
certificate and began working. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words," Murphy said, "she started feeling respected. She saw 
possibilities."

STARR POWER: LIFE AND TIMES OF A STRIPTEASE QUEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK LOVECE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ELDERSBURG, Md. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The real Blaze was a real star. Gypsy Rose Lee, Sally Rand, Ann Corio, Blaze 
Starr -- these were the MVPs and VIPs of the strip-joint runways. In her prime 
in '59, when she met and fell in love with Louisiana Gov. Earl K. Long, Blaze 
Starr was commanding a then-queenly $1,500 a week. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a lot more money," she recalls, "than Gov. Long was making on the up 
and up with his salary." 
</P>
<P>
Starr, still disconcertingly sexy at 57, still possessed of measurements she 
gives -- cueing no debate -- as 38DD-24-37, gave up stripping six years ago to 
become a gemologist and make and sell jewelry. Each holiday season, at the 
Carrolltowne Mall here in the Baltimore suburbs, she is a local celebrity 
selling earrings, bracelets and necklaces fashioned from the gemstones and 
crystals she collects the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In the Touchstone film based on her affair with Long, Starr, herself is a 
shooting Starr. She says Playboy is about to publish a photo spread of her, and 
Las Vegas wants her to strip again. She even appears in the movie, doing a 
cameo as one of the strippers backstage when Long goes hunting for Starr 
("Hello, Governor," she says when Paul Newman plants a familiar kiss on her 
shoulder.) 
</P>
<P>
Starr hasn't ridden such a whirlwind of publicity since her autobiography -- 
"Blaze Starr: My Life as Told to Huey Perry" -- was published in 1974. In that 
book, her romance with Long takes up only a couple of chapters. "Blaze" 
writer-director Ron Shelton, who optioned the biography in 1983, "told me I had 
20 movies in there," Starr proudly announces in her thick, magnolia-scented 
accent. She says that there had even been talk once of doing a full-length 
stage musical about her. 
</P>
<P>
But now, there is the movie, and it's a big one -- done by a major studio with 
a major star (Newman as Long) and a highly touted newcomer (Lolita Davidovich) 
portraying her. The movie takes Starr from her midteens at home in the hills of 
West Virginia to about age 30, when Long died. 
</P>
<P>
By her account, Starr was born Fannie Belle Fleming in the tiny southwest West 
Virginia community of Twelvepole Creek. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived two miles from the car road," Starr says. "There was the car road, 
and the horse road and the cattle path. And this was a dirt road; it was like 
15 miles to the hardtop road, where there was a bus." 
</P>
<P>
At 15, Starr left home to start a career as a country singer, getting as far as 
a strip joint called the Quonset Hut in the nation's capital. In the movie, she 
is a sweet young thing who goes on stage meaning to sing, then discovers the 
audience is there to see her strip. In real life, the club's owner had first 
taken her to a club where the well-known stripper Pat Amber Halliday performed. 
Starr was star-struck. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked what I saw. And I thought, 'My God, to be on stage! And you're not 
naked.' Back then, you wore a thick, net bra with great big beaded parts on the 
end. Today, you see more on the beach! So I looked in the mirror and checked 
out my measurements." 
</P>
<P>
She was still underage, but, she says, matter-of-factly, "I had these boobs 
when I was 14. That's how I could pass for 18 so easy." 
</P>
<P>
Her assets made her a natural, but when the owner put the moves on her, she 
made a dramatic escape that the movie fairly accurately depicts. Other events 
were dramatized, of course; though with Starr, some of the more unbelievable 
things turn out to be true. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be a star," Starr says, "and I wanted something different 
undressing me. Everything was used by then: snakes, birds, monkeys. I figured, 
'What hasn't been done?' " 
</P>
<P>
Answer: panthers. So, for a while, Starr worked with a big jungle cat, which 
was trained to undo a ribbon tied behind her and allow her costume to fall to 
the floor. (Years later, she says, one of the cats turned on her and she 
realized "why nobody used 'em.") 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, one of the most visual and exciting moments of her life became much 
less dramatic in the movie: Her first meeting with Earl Long. 
</P>
<P>
In the film, as in reality, Long is smitten at the first sight of Starr 
performing in a New Orleans club. The first thing Long saw her do on stage was 
her trademark "exploding couch" number. 
</P>
<P>
"I had finally got my gimmick, a comedy thing," she says, "where I'm supposed 
to be getting so worked up that I stretch out on the couch, and -- when I push 
a secret button -- smoke starts coming out from like between my legs. Then a 
fan and a floodlight come on, and you see all these red silk streamers blowing, 
shaped just like flames, so it looked like the couch had just burst into fire." 
</P>
<P>
Long was impressed and began pursuing the stripper. The 62-year-old politician 
and the 20-something stripper had little in common, except heartache. She was 
divorcing her husband, club owner Carroll Glorioso, and Long was reportedly 
living alone in a separate wing of the governor's mansion, away from his wife, 
"Miz Blanche." 
</P>
<P>
Blanche Long was a very public figure at the time, but she did not want her 
name and likeness used in the movie, so the film makers did not include her. 
Starr refuses to even utter the former Louisiana First Lady's name. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an agreement," Starr says when pressed. "Disney don't need any flak 
about being sued and all that, even though she couldn't get nothin', 'cause 
it's the truth." 
</P>
<P>
The absence of a wife waters down the scandal in the film. In 1950s Louisiana, 
it was one thing for a politician to cavort with a striptease star, but to do 
it with a wife at home was even more disconcerting to constituents. "Blaze" is 
much more a straight-ahead love story than the story of an affair that rocked 
the South. 
</P>
<P>
And what of that romance? Was it Long's power that attracted Starr? 
</P>
<P>
"No, that didn't faze me," she says. "Because I had my own power in my own 
little world. Earl was sweet, he was nice. I dated him, we'd go to dinner, to 
the race track -- all this for about three months before he even kissed me. And 
then I just started kind of leaning on him and depending on him." 
</P>
<P>
Their relationship was physical, but not right away, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, when I met him I was grieving because I was goin' through a divorce. 
But he was very protective of me when the news media started hounding me. He 
would put his arm around me and stand right there and say, 'I love her and 
that's that.' I'm like, 'Gee nobody's ever done this for me.' 
</P>
<P>
"So, here's this older man who wants to marry me. I'd only been intimate with 
him two or three times, when my divorce was gonna be final. But then he started 
talkin' divorce to Miz . . . to his wife. And she didn't wanna hear it. She 
blew her mind: 'You're throwing away everything the Longs have fought for!' " 
</P>
<P>
It turned out not to matter. After a few months out of politics, Earl won the 
1960 Democratic nomination for his district's congressional seat, and died a 
few days later. Starr assures us he would have loved the movie.

ROLE MORE THAN SKIN-DEEP FOR DAVIDOVICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta ... -- 
Vladimir Nabokov, in his novel "Lolita" 
</P>
<P>
Though the voluptuous body she flaunts on screen will never be mistaken for 
that of the skinny adolescent nymphet Nabokov immortalized in his classic love 
story, Lolita Davidovich inspires that same kind of passion. 
</P>
<P>
Playing the title role in "Blaze," the story of the fiery-eyed stripper who 
stirred scandal in the bayou when she stole the heart of eccentric Louisiana 
Gov. Earl Long in 1959, Davidovich is ablaze with a sensuous mix of sex and 
sweetness that is likely to weaken the knees of grown men while simultaneously 
drumming up respect for the profession of at least this one "exotic dancer." 
</P>
<P>
"Blaze Starr was such an anachronism, that was the exciting part for me," said 
Davidovich, the unknown Canadian actress who nabbed the role that had once been 
assigned to Melanie Griffith. "Despite the world of her work, she was such a 
lady, she had such a sweetness, it was wild. That was what I had to try to 
capture. She's so much more than a stripper. 
</P>
<P>
"Every stripper had a gimmick. Her specialty was her sense of humor and she was 
always talking when she was on stage. That's what burlesque was all about, 
dating all the way back to Aristophanes. They used puns and wisecracks. She did 
it in such a good-natured way that there was nothing seedy about it. And that 
lightness and festiveness was essentially what I had to grasp." 
</P>
<P>
Davidovich also had to grow into the role, physically, adding bulk to a figure 
that would look more at home on a ballet stage than on a strip-show runway. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 20 pounds heavier when I did the movie, but obviously I don't look 
anything like that," Davidovich said, gesturing to her once-again skinny body 
and conjuring up the image of Blaze Starr's celebrated 38DD chest. "That was 
wardrobe. Those were rented." 
</P>
<P>
So, how did an actress of such lithe proportions end up being picked for the 
title role of a movie that co-stars the quintessential leading man, Paul 
Newman? When Davidovich's selection was announced early this year, over several 
well-known candidates, the one-word chorus in Hollywood was, "Who?" 
</P>
<P>
Lolita (her real name) Davidovich was born in London, Ontario, Canada, to 
Yugoslav parents. She spoke nothing but Serbian until she entered kindergarten. 
She says she is 28; a short profile in next month's Vanity Fair lists her as 
27; someone close to the casting of "Blaze" insists she is at least 30. 
</P>
<P>
What is known for certain is that the auburn-haired actress could boast of 
nothing more than one-line-of-dialogue type roles in "The Big Town" and 
"Adventures in Babysitting" when she auditioned for "Blaze." When asked what 
she had done before landing this choice part, Davidovich replied, "nothing I 
care about." 
</P>
<P>
Melanie Griffith, fresh off her Oscar nomination for "Working Girl," was 
reportedly going to play Blaze, but had to drop out when she became pregnant. 
Vicki Thomas, the film's casting director, interviewed more than 600 women and 
director Ron Shelton auditioned another 100 or so before they settled on 
Lolita. Among the other actresses considered were established stars Diane Lane 
and Virginia Madsen. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a quality of openness and straightforwardness and good-heartedness that 
came through that was clearly not being faked," said Shelton, explaining why he 
chose Davidovich. "She doesn't have a rigorous set of acting ideologies that 
you could never get past. She's open to any suggestion and interpretation. And 
she brings a kind of enthusiasm and ebullience when she walks into a room and 
that's also something you can't fake." 
</P>
<P>
Shelton said that Newman's box-office name gave him the freedom to cast an 
unknown as his co-star. He called Davidovich's performance "extraordinary," 
saying "she pulled off something that was a lot harder than she knew, and she 
did it with panache." Her only difficulty throughout the long shoot, Shelton 
said, was mustering the bravado to project her voice with the requisite wry, 
sultry confidence during the stripping scenes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a nightmare logistically," Shelton said. "We had 300 extras, and you 
shoot it without music, yet she had to have a physical rhythm to dance to. So 
we put a wireless click track in her ear to give her a beat, and we had all 
these sailors screaming in pantomime. For her to seem at ease in that surreal 
environment is a major trick. And to do it in the second week in her first 
major movie is even a bigger trick. It's a performance." 
</P>
<P>
Davidovich, who describes herself as "reserved and very private," said she had 
no qualms about taking on such a sexy role her first time out, nor about 
exposing so much of herself on screen. For one thing, she insisted, what you 
see is more movie magic than her own body. With all the body makeup, theatrical 
costumes, padding and props, she said it was easy to hide her inhibitions and 
just let the riotous stripper side of the character roar out. 
</P>
<P>
And besides, she said, "the next time the audience sees me, I'll be a demure 
Slavic peasant or something."

LAST TANGO: Leona Helmsley, who pleaded for mercy in a New York court Tuesday 
(A1), cut a different figure in Orange County in March, dancing the night away 
with husband Harry at the Ritz-Carlton hotel. . . . Here for a reunion of 
award-winning hotel owners, Helmsley chatted airily that night with 
Ritz-Carlton VP Henry Schielein, who avoided talk of her legal problems. . . . 
"We just talked about California, about New York, about her hotel, our hotel," 
he said. "I would never want to touch that subject." Dana Parsons

COUNCIL BACKS MASSIVE ORANGE DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ORANGE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a historic vote Tuesday, the Orange City Council endorsed a massive plan by 
the Irvine Co. to build 12,000 homes, a hotel and major recreational facilities 
over the next 20 years in the unincorporated area east of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Council members voted 5 to 0 to approve the project's environmental impact 
report, marking a milestone in the progress of what is a huge development even 
by Orange County standards. Under the development plan, the Irvine Co. proposes 
to dramatically reshape the face of Orange, where the current population of 
106,000 would leap to nearly 150,000 by the time of the project's completion. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Mayor Don E. Smith, Orange officials have long backed the proposal, but 
residents have expressed reservations, citing the traffic and other problems 
with absorbing a massive development on the city's eastern border. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Meddick, one of several residents who spoke against the plan Tuesday, 
submitted a petition to the City Council that she said bore dozens of 
signatures favoring rejection of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody is saying, 'Enough is enough.' The figure of 12,000 homes is 
just too much," Meddick said. 
</P>
<P>
The project is the largest single planned community ever attempted by the 
Irvine Co., according to a spokeswoman for the developer. The company, Orange 
County's largest and most powerful developer, owns about a sixth of the 
county's land and is currently embroiled in controversy over its proposed 
Laguna Laurel planned community. 
</P>
<P>
But the Orange project dwarfs even Laguna Laurel, which would build 3,200 homes 
on 2,150 acres of land. 
</P>
<P>
The East Orange development would eventually contain nearly four times as many 
homes and three times as much as land. 
</P>
<P>
Not since the February, 1988, landmark agreement between developers and the 
Orange County Board of Supervisors -- which ensured construction of nearly 
18,000 homes in Rancho Santa Margarita, the Foothill Ranch and Dove Canyon -- 
has such a large plan been endorsed. 
</P>
<P>
The 7,110-acre East Orange development is expected to be built in four or five 
phases over the next 15 to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the development, currently outside the city limits, to be 
annexed as each phase is completed. 
</P>
<P>
More than 12,300 housing units would be built, along with a recreation center, 
golf course and civic center. Two major commercial centers are expected to 
create 27,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-square-mile area, running along each side of Rancho Santiago Boulevard 
and including Irvine Lake, would contain a hotel, four activity centers, 
businesses and community services surrounded by residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
But the project has its detractors. At a November council hearing, about 100 
residents expressed fears that it would contribute to snarled traffic in the 
city, and county officials have indicated their concerns as well, suggesting a 
slate of road improvements that they believe should accompany the development. 
</P>
<P>
And the Serrano Irrigation District, which has been supplying drinking water to 
nearby customers for more than 50 years, has expressed alarm about the massive 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"The easy thing for this water district is to roll over and give up the 
reservoir to the Irvine Co.," said David Noyes, Serrano's executive director. 
"But my gut feeling is that it is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
With 9,000 customers in Villa Park and parts of Orange, the district might be 
forced to import its water from the Metropolitan Water District in Los Angeles 
rather than draw from the Santiago Reservoir, more commonly known as Irvine 
Lake, Noyes said. The reservoir is co-owned by the water district and the 
Irvine Ranch Water District, which provides irrigation to agricultural 
customers and is not associated with the developer. 
</P>
<P>
Before Tuesday night's meeting, the water district's board of directors had 
taken action authorizing a lawsuit if the City Council adopted the 
environmental impact report for the amendment, Noyes said. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally our contention was that the Irvine Co. didn't address water quality 
in its EIR (environment impact report). But it's gone beyond that. Now they 
want us out of the lake so the Irvine Co. can use it as another Lake Mission 
Viejo. They want an aesthetic reservoir inside their development," Noyes said. 
</P>
<P>
But at a recent water district board meeting, Brad Olson, in charge of the 
developer's East Orange consultant team, pressured the water district into 
moving from the lake, according to Noyes. 
</P>
<P>
"They're asking us to abandon a local water supply that we've had for nearly 60 
years. This is native water. We don't import it at all. It comes from Santiago 
Creek which flows in from the Cleveland National Forest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At a City Council hearing in November, the development was criticized by some 
residents concerned about growth and traffic problems. But Mayor Smith and 
several other council members supported the proposed amendment, saying that if 
the measure is approved the Irvine Co.'s future plans would come under close 
scrutiny by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
At that hearing, Smith said he understood the concerns expressed about 
increased growth and traffic problems. But he said he believed that "This is a 
good plan and it is good for the City of Orange."

DIFFERENT TRACKS: A monorail linking a proposed Irvine commercial-residential 
development and the terminal at John Wayne Airport was envisioned as a possible 
first step in a bigger system. . . . But airport officials now say the monorail 
is in limbo because its developer -- the McDonnell Douglas Realty Co. -- hasn't 
filed updated plans. "We're not going to put projects on hold while they make 
decisions," said an airport official. McDonnell Douglas replies that the 
monorail is a "full go." Dana Parsons

GOING UP: It may be the happiest place on earth, but it isn't the cheapest: 
Ticket prices are up again at Disneyland (D7), where a $2 increase brings the 
cost of adult admission to $25.50. Kids now pay $20.50 and parking is up a 
dollar to $4. . . . Will this hurt attendance? Not likely, say industry

DIANNE KLEIN: IT'S THE SIZE OF DUMPSTER THAT DETERMINES STATUS HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dianne Klein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Felder was pointing out a boxy little white house, one-story stucco, 
without an ocean view, on a side street on Lido Isle in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Felder was especially interested in this house because he is a builder, quite a 
successful one from the look of it, who was standing in front of one of his own 
creations, a two-story stucco number painted a tasteful, subtle terra cotta. 
</P>
<P>
"Take a guess at how much they just sold that for?" Felder says, motioning down 
the street and employing a tone that a three-card monte dealer might use on a 
tourist who had stumbled into alien territory. 
</P>
<P>
I shrug my shoulders, conceding defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"Four hundred seventy," he says, meaning thousands, of course. "And it's a 
bulldoze job." 
</P>
<P>
Felder, you understand, means that literally. No sooner does escrow close on 
these quaint remnants of less opulent times then the wrecking crew arrives. 
Then they start over, and better. 
</P>
<P>
"And the cheapest scraper I've seen on this side," Felder says with a wave of 
his arm toward the waterfront homes in front of us, "is $1.2 million. So they 
tear that down and put up a million-dollar house. By the time you're done, 
you're talking about $2.5 million." 
</P>
<P>
Such figures bring comfort to the homeowners of Lido Isle, generating that 
special warmth that only a good investment can bring, and so they are digging 
in -- just about as deep as one can on an island. 
</P>
<P>
They are in the midst of a demolition and renovation frenzy that, according to 
reliable estimates, has left not a single street untouched. Paint-splattered 
dumpsters hog coveted street parking and the vans and pickup trucks of 
accompanying work crews take up most of what's left. 
</P>
<P>
"The joke at dinner parties is that it's no longer the Mercedes in your garage 
that's the thing, but the dumpster in front of it," says realtor Kay Polovina, 
herself a renovator who has lived on Lido most of her life. "It is definitely 
the status symbol." 
</P>
<P>
Another newly renovated resident, who asks that her name not be used, confesses 
to posing bathing beauty style for a snapshot in front of her own rather 
impressive dumpster. 
</P>
<P>
And not to be too picky about it, she confides that some residents presumedly 
without their own dumpsters have surreptitiously availed themselves of her own. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of ticks you off," she says. "People have thrown rusty old barbecues, 
even a bathroom wash basin into our dumpster. Plus, there's the dog doo-doo, 
all the walkers with their packages that don't want to wait until they get 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"The other day there was a guy walking down the street with a piece of concrete 
headed for our dumpster. He was strolling casually, as casually as you can with 
a chunk of concrete, and so then I said hello. He kept on walking. . . . Until 
I had one myself, I didn't think about how possessive you can get of your 
dumpster. You find yourself kind of lurking around it." 
</P>
<P>
Not that there is much room for lurking what with all the hammering, plastering 
and painting going on. Residents of this snippet of real estate in Newport Bay 
are putting in new windows, new floors and new entry ways. They are toppling 
walls and punching out low ceilings. Then, what the heck, they might knock it 
all down and start from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a house on the water in the high threes that's in escrow now," says 
realtor Polovina, meaning millions, of course. 
</P>
<P>
"I bet you they tear that one down. . . . It's a great lot, but the house does 
need a lot of work." 
</P>
<P>
What that means, as everybody knows, is an end to those awful little chopped up 
rooms with dark carpeting and flocked wallpaper. Newer is light, open and airy. 
This is understood to be very Californian, and certainly, very Lido. 
</P>
<P>
Here even the street names -- Nice, Trieste, San Remo -- manage to reflect a 
Mediterranean savoir-faire without sacrificing good old Germanic orderliness. 
Except for the shoreline drives, the streets are alphabetized. 
</P>
<P>
The beaches are private, as are the yacht and tennis clubs. Flowers seem always 
to be in bloom, and well-fed cats lounge in the hedges outlining many of the 
860 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Those on the periphery make up for a somewhat regrettable shortage of green 
space with an expanse of blue just out the back. This is where they dock their 
50-foot yachts next to their smaller, more fuel-efficient "bay boats," ideal 
for jaunts to local restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
But residents say what really sets them apart is their community's cozy, 
small-town atmosphere. Here, they all look out for each other. 
</P>
<P>
Which is why, of course, homeowners seem so concerned about all the 
construction, as Pete Yeomans, a general contractor who works exclusively on 
Lido, can attest to. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, people stop by all the time," he says above the whirl of a power saw in 
one resident's garage. "They want to know what we are doing and how much it is 
costing." 
</P>
<P>
What it costs, Yeomans says, is usually in the neighborhood of $250,000 for 
your standard new look, such as a recent job of changing a rather predictable 
six bedrooms into a spectacular four. 
</P>
<P>
"We changed one of the bedrooms into a big bathroom for the lady," he says 
before rattling off such standards as a sunken tub, vanity and whirlpool. "And 
it has a walk-in shoe closet." 
</P>
<P>
Then there was another house, an electrical contractor pipes up, where the 
owners just spent $30,000 to give their kitchen cabinets a face lift. 
</P>
<P>
"That was just for the cabinets," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But so as not to leave the impression that everybody on Lido is absorbed in the 
sociology of home improvement, it is worth noting that at least one waterfront 
resident, now living in her third Lido home, took exception to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"That's ridiculous," she says, "I've never heard anything so stupid. This 
island started out as a colony of summer houses. This is why all the remodeling 
is going on, to try to make these livable city homes. These properties are 32 
to 42 feet wide. I've been on boats that are wider than that. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very friendly community, an extremely friendly community," she adds. 
Then she had to go. And no, she says, I did not need to know her name. 
</P>

COUNCIL VOTES TO TOUGHEN BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council voted unanimously to adopt an ordinance to improve the safety 
of about 100 unreinforced masonry buildings considered liable to earthquake 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is part of the city's move to comply with a 1986 state law that 
requires cities in areas prone to earthquakes to rehabilitate structures that 
do not meet certain standards. 
</P>
<P>
The Building Department, in conjunction with Oscar Larson &amp; Associates in 
Eureka, an engineering consulting firm, is working on the list of buildings, 
all in commercial districts. The list must be forwarded to the state Seismic 
Safety Commission by Jan 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Those buildings identified as the most hazardous will be required to have 
reinforcements installed by Jan. 1, 1994.

BOYS TOWN USA PROJECT APPROVED

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a last-minute objection from a resident, the County Board of 
Supervisors Tuesday granted final approval to Boys Town USA to build five homes 
on 13 acres northeast of Mission Viejo near Trabuco Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
The board voted 5 to 0 to approve the project following a final appeal by Ray 
Chandos, co-founder of the Rural Canyon Conservation Fund. He claimed that 
changes had been made to plans since the last public hearing two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Chandos, who lives in view of the project that is located on a ridge between 
Rose and Hickey canyons, said the changes should be reviewed by the public and 
appropriate government agencies before the board gives its final approval. 
</P>
<P>
But Michael Ruane, director of planning for the Environmental Management 
Agency, said the latest changes did not require more formal review and in fact 
"strengthen the project." 
</P>
<P>
Chandos has filed suit seeking a court order to set aside the county Planning 
Commission's approval of the project. The suit claims that the project is 
inconsistent with parts of the county general plan. 
</P>
<P>
Residents opposed to the project say they are not against Boys Town or the 
project, but to its location on a ridgeline. They are concerned that it will 
set a precedent for building on ridgelines. GEORGE FRANK

5 ARTWORKS FAIL TO GET MINIMUM BIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service on Tuesday failed to get the minimum $10,500 it 
sought for five artworks said to be creations of Salvador Dali at a public 
auction and will try to sell the pieces again next spring, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
When the artworks were offered separately for bids, the total of the five 
highest bids was only $4,540. Of the estimated 50 people who attended the 
auction, several expressed concern that the works might be fakes and were 
hesitant to offer higher bids, spokeswoman Sally Ruhnau said. 
</P>
<P>
The artworks, along with several parcels of real estate, were seized for 
nonpayment of taxes. The five pieces consisted of two identical 1976 
tapestries, "Lincoln in Dalivision"; a wood engraving, "Divine Comedy -- The 
Misers" from 1963; and two hand-colored etchings from the "Astrology Series, 
"Aries" and "Leo," both from 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS had the pieces appraised by Richard G. Ruskin of Ruskin Fine Arts of 
Los Angeles. He listed the fair-market value of each tapestry at $5,700. He 
appraised the wood engraving at $420, and the etchings at $240 each. 
</P>
<P>
But the highest bid at the auction for either tapestry was $2,050, and "The 
Misers" drew a bid of only $300. Those bids came from Clay Baxter of Yorba 
Linda, who said he did not believe that the IRS would sell forged items. THUAN

<TEXT>
<P>
City Council members deadlocked Tuesday in efforts to replace ousted Councilman 
Fred Voss, finally deciding to leave his seat vacant. 
</P>
<P>
When voters ousted Voss on Nov. 7, they also chose to replace him by council 
appointment rather than special election. But City Atty. Alan R. Burns said 
Tuesday that he believes that the council fulfilled its duty by attempting 
twice to appoint a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Mayor Laurann Cook and Councilman James E. Neal both voted for John 
Collins because he was the runner-up in the last election. Council members 
James Petrikin and George Scott both supported John McKnight because they had 
both worked with him on city commissions. 
</P>
<P>
Burns said he did not think a four-member council will pose a problem, "because 
the council members are not sharply divided on any issues other than this one."

TIRES, DIAPERS SEEN AS WASTE PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Board of Supervisors looked at alternative ways of getting rid of 
millions of old car tires, one supervisor, Roger R. Stanton, warned Tuesday of 
another product that might pose future problems for the county's landfills -- 
disposable diapers. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to warn staff I will be asking for an additional study about a 
problem regarding a product that we all don't use, at least I hope not, and 
that's disposable diapers," Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
"And I understand from studies that have been made available to my staff . . . 
(disposable diapers) make up 2% of the solid waste that we have to deal with in 
this county." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley pointed out that 42,000 children were born 
during the county's Centennial Year, implying that the new babies accounted for 
a lot of disposable diapers. 
</P>
<P>
After the discussion, the board voted unanimously to study waste-to-energy 
options for disposing of the 2 million tires each year taken to county 
landfills. Tires, which account for one-half of 1% of the area's solid waste, 
have long been a nuisance at the landfills, and because of their bulkiness they 
often pop to the surface after being buried. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal by Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez also directed county staff to: 
</P>
<P>
* Work with other Southern California counties to develop a regional approach 
for disposing of unusable tires. 
</P>
<P>
* Solicit proposals to recycle old tires into useful raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
* Continue to explore implementation of a county-operated tire-shredding 
program. 
</P>
<P>
County officials are also looking into waste-to-energy disposal of the tires 
through pyrolysis (chemical decomposition using heat) and incineration. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors have also proposed a new ordinance that would make it illegal to 
dispose of tires anywhere but at designated dump sites. GEORGE FRANK

ANTI-CRIME MEASURE QUALIFIES FOR BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A court-reform initiative sponsored by Sen. Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim) was 
certified Tuesday to appear on the June 6 ballot, Secretary of State March Fong 
Eu announced. 
</P>
<P>
Eu said in Sacramento that random sampling conducted by her office indicated 
that 665,162 of the signatures submitted with the Royce initiative were valid. 
To put a measure on the ballot requires 655,034 names. 
</P>
<P>
With Tuesday's certification, the Royce measure becomes the first initiative to 
qualify for the June ballot, which also features nine other legislative 
proposals, including a gas tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Royce's measure, known as the Crime Victims' Initiative, is designed to 
streamline criminal trials by changing the way jurors are selected and by 
imposing time constraints on court-appointed attorneys. It also expands the 
definition of first-degree murder and broadens the use of capital punishment 
for murders committed under special circumstances.

JOURNALISM: AUTHOR INTENDED ARTICLE ON ISRAELI MISSILES TO BE ANTI-NUCLEAR, BUT 
CRITICS READ IT AS ANTI-SEMITIC.

<P>
An article and political cartoon attacking Israel in the Saddleback College 
newspaper last week has drawn harsh criticism from administrators, teachers and 
students, who charged that the opinion pieces were anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
The strongly worded article and accompanying cartoon, written and drawn by 
journalism student Michael S. Boren, criticized Israel for stockpiling nuclear 
weapons. The headline above the article states: "Israel enters nuclear arms 
race." 
</P>
<P>
The cartoon depicts a Hanukkah menorah that is tipped by singing nuclear 
warheads instead of candles. On each warhead is a Star of David. The warheads 
are drawn with smiles, singing: "We Wish You a Happy Holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
Although Boren claims the commentary, which appeared in the Dec. 7 issue of the 
Lariat, was meant to draw attention to the dangers of nuclear warfare, the 
piece was seen as hateful by Jewish students and employees and a case of 
extremely poor judgment by administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
"Using a Hanukkah menorah as a rocket launching pad is sacrilegious," said 
Frieda Gelber, a Jewish student and employee at the 23,000-student two-year 
college. "I was very angry when I saw it." 
</P>
<P>
While Gelber and other Jewish students said that they have written to Gov. 
George Deukmejian, local rabbis and Jewish community leaders in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties, top college administrators were requesting that the newspaper 
print a retraction and an apology. 
</P>
<P>
They said that the article, although protected by the First Amendment as the 
opinion of the writer, overstepped the bounds of responsible journalism. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I saw that, I was shocked and appalled," Saddleback College 
President Constance M. Carroll said on Tuesday. "I recognize as a historian 
that the Holocaust is unprecedented in its tragedy. And the use of the 
religious symbolism was inexcusable." 
</P>
<P>
Left Up to Editors 
</P>
<P>
Carol Ziehm, faculty adviser to the weekly student publication, said that she 
met with the student staff members on Tuesday and discussed Carroll's request. 
</P>
<P>
Her meeting with the students followed meetings with Carroll, who urged that 
the article be recanted. 
</P>
<P>
But, Ziehm said, it would be up to the students to decide if they will print a 
retraction when the next edition is published on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are talking about here is something precious. That is freedom of 
speech," Ziehm said. "It is very difficult to work within that realm without 
some strong reaction." 
</P>
<P>
Ziehm said that she read the article and saw the cartoon before it was 
published, but did not advise student staff members to withhold its 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
"I was fairly certain that it was the type of strong statement that would evoke 
some response," Ziehm said. "But that is something we encourage in our opinion 
columns." 
</P>
<P>
She said that although the newspaper has received only three letters to the 
editor about the commentary so far, she has gotten "considerably more phone 
calls." She said that she is encouraging callers to write rebuttals to the 
editor, Steve Sakach. 
</P>
<P>
'We Regret the Insult' 
</P>
<P>
Richard J. Sneed, chancellor of the Saddleback Community College District, said 
that he and other college administrators have received an onslaught of calls 
from people condemning the article and cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
"We regret the insult to the community," Sneed said. "This was insensitive and 
arrogant and does not reflect good journalism." 
</P>
<P>
Boren's article, which makes numerous references to the ongoing conflict 
between Israel and its Arab neighbors, begins with a statement that "the only 
thing holy about a holy war is that holes get shot in people." 
</P>
<P>
"After years of engaging in conventional warfare with the Palestinians, Israel 
finally has launched itself into the nuclear age by announcing that it is now 
the proud owner of nuclear weapons." 
</P>
<P>
Boren goes on to write that "since the occupation of Palestine . . . the 
Israelis have displayed . . . that they will resort to any means to protect 
their religious claim on the land." 
</P>
<P>
The short article ends with: "The Israelis claim that they have a divine right 
to Palestine. If they are indeed God's chosen people, though, it would seem 
that God might have made a better choice." 
</P>
<P>
Boren defends the article, and says that his intention to write about his 
anti-nuclear views was misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
"It was totally taken the wrong way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that, Boren said, he does not intend to write a retraction or an 
apology. He said, however, that he will write a second opinion piece that 
outlines his anti-nuclear views more clearly. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to point out the dangers of nuclear weapons," Boren said. "I 
was more concerned about the politics. That was mainly the gist of it." 
</P>
<P>
Boren said that he is not anti-Semitic. "My girlfriend is Jewish," he said. 
"Her grandfather was in a concentration camp." 
</P>
<P>
He conceded, however that his article's final paragraph could have been 
omitted. "This proves to me that there are boundaries that you can't cross," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But some Jewish students called for Boren to give up his position as the 
Lariat's art editor. 
</P>
<P>
"I respect freedom of speech, but this went too far," said student Sean Cook, 
who said that he and his rabbi will also deliver letters to the newspaper 
within the week. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to think about what you are doing, especially in this (college) 
community, where there is so much diversity. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only Jews, but every race needs to be aware of what people are writing in 
the paper," said Cook, a 19-year-old freshman. "It's not really right for any 
ethnic or religious group to be abused."

Lupe Bianes ran up to the front door of Our Lady of Guadalupe Church. It was 
4:30 a.m. Tuesday, and Bianes, who lives in San Francisco, did not know if she 
was at the right place. "Are they holding Mass here for the Virgin Mother?" she 
asked a bystander in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Bianes, 59, said she has not missed the morning celebration since she was a 
little girl, when her mother used to take her. Bianes, like many of the other 
400 Latinos who gathered at this small church, had a devotion to the patron 
saint of Mexico, an adoration passed from one generation to another in the 
Mexican community. 
</P>
<P>
Our Lady of Guadalupe was among a dozen churches in Orange County honoring the 
Virgin Mother on Tuesday with festivities that included special Masses, 
candlelight processions and traditional Mexican foods. 
</P>
<P>
The festivities commemorate the day the Virgin Mary is believed to have 
appeared to Juan Diego, a poor Indian. 
</P>
<P>
According to the story, Diego was on his way to Tepeyac Hill, in what is now 
Mexico City, when the vision appeared on Dec. 9, 1531. The Lady told him to ask 
the bishop to build a shrine where she stood. But when Diego conveyed the news, 
the bishop doubted his word. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 12, the vision appeared again and told Diego to go to Tepeyac Hill and 
pick roses. Diego told this to the bishop as well. Knowing that the land on the 
hill was dry and cracked, the bishop this time said that if Diego found the 
flowers, he would believe him. Diego went to the hill, found the flowers, 
picked them and placed them in his tilma, a capelike garment. As he unraveled 
the garment and laid the roses at the bishop's feet, the story says, the image 
of Our Lady of Guadalupe appeared on his cape. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Catholic churches in Mexico and Southern California continue to capture 
the emotion and old religious customs when they honor Our Lady of Guadalupe. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, mariachis strolled down the middle aisle of the darkened church 
singing the traditional song, "Las Mananitas." As they approached the altar, 
the lights came on to reveal a painting of the Virgin Mother. The mariachis 
sang hymns of prayer written for Our Lady of Guadalupe. 
</P>
<P>
Bianes knelt in a middle pew, put her hands together and prayed. Next to her 
was a mother and a boy of about 5. The boy rubbed his eyes as if he had just 
awakened, and his hair was still rumpled from the night before. 
</P>
<P>
Women with flowers in their hair and brightly colored shawls walked up to the 
altar to offer baskets of fruit, flowers or food. The older women had dark 
veils and red, white and green sashes around their necks. 
</P>
<P>
After mass, church members gathered in a reception hall and had hot chocolate 
and Mexican sweetbread. The mariachis continued to play and sing festive songs. 
</P>
<P>
"The celebration at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church has always been very rich and 
colorful," said Father Jaime Soto, episcopal vicar for the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Soto said the Virgin Mother is the patron saint of the Catholic Diocese of 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, Latinos gathered in front of the church. In a candlelight 
procession, they walked around the neighborhood singing songs of prayer. 
Children were dressed like Juan Diego and the Virgin Mother. Adults wore 
traditional Mexican costumes. At the procession's front, a man held the image 
of the Virgin Mother. 
</P>
<P>
The procession ended back at the church and was followed by another Mass with 
mariachis. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Carmen Sarati of St. Joseph Church in Santa Ana said, "Our Lady of 
Guadalupe's very presence becomes absorbed by symbolism and images." 
</P>
<P>
In a church display, the Virgin stands on a crescent moon and wears a blue veil 
covered with gold stars. The sun's rays are behind her as she looks 
compassionately down at a small Indian boy at her feet. She represents the 
poor, oppressed, and silenced masses of Mexican society at the time of the 
Spanish conquest, Sarati said. In contrast, the rays behind her show her 
overshadowing presence and power. 
</P>
<P>
"She is the symbol of her people, the nation, of Mexico," Sarati said.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
TRAUMA CARE IS ON CRITICAL LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In two weeks, the Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center will 
close its trauma center, which lost $1 million last year and had been projected 
to lose $3 million in 1990. Almost nothing can be done to save the facility at 
this late date. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the Board of Supervisors and concerned officials and community groups 
move quickly, the Orange County system that began eight years ago to save lives 
-- particularly in the "golden hour" after a severe injury -- may be in danger. 
Once there were five trauma centers in the county, but soon there will be only 
three, all of them under added financial pressure as the system dwindles. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of the Fountain Valley facility points up once again -- as if another 
reminder were needed -- the crisis in health care affecting not only Orange 
County but the rest of California and the nation as well. It is caused in part 
by the inability of hospitals and physicians to absorb the cost of treating the 
indigent and uninsured without sufficient reimbursement by the government. 
</P>
<P>
On a broader scale, the entire system of health-care delivery in this nation 
must be rethought. But in the meantime, the Board of Supervisors needs to find 
ways to increase revenues to Orange County's trauma-care system that do not 
steal from one health program to finance another. 
</P>
<P>
The board must aggressively explore ways to increase state funding for health 
care. At present, Orange County is shorted about $45 million a year by state 
health officials, because of formulas that favor urban counties. While attempts 
have been made to right this wrong, it is time for a no-holds-barred effort by 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
This was one of several recommendations adopted recently by the United Way 
Health Care Task Force consisting of 45 Orange County provider, business, 
civic, labor and other organizations. Unless the board moves quickly, there may 
be little left of the trauma system to save.

VIETNAMESE PARENTS ADVISED ON TROUBLED YOUTHS

Rocked by recent reports of gangs, teen pregnancy and alienation among 
Vietnamese-American youth, about 30 parents came to Westminster High School 
Tuesday night for advice on how to handle their troubled young people. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to say that it's hopeless, but the situation is alarming," said 
Chi Duy Do, a counselor with Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc., a 
nonprofit social services agency. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the 15-year-old Vietnamese-American honors student whose newborn baby 
drowned recently in a high school toilet, reports of violent feuds among gangs 
of teen-age girls and increasing drug abuse, Do said the Vietnamese community 
must begin facing up to its youth problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to ask our children why they prefer to spend more time in prison than 
in the warmth of their families' home," Do said, speaking in Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
The forum was one of the first all-Vietnamese programs for Westminster High 
parents. Speakers explained how to recognize cigarette burns and cuts that 
could signify gang involvement, how to spot drug abuse and which Orange County 
agencies can provide parents with Vietnamese-language help. 
</P>
<P>
"They need our love and support," said counselor Tran Linh. "Pool them into the 
family. Don't let them run with bad company." 
</P>
<P>
Among the problems that Do and other speakers said contribute to teen 
estrangement are loneliness, lack of basic education in Vietnam in preparation 
for American schooling and language deficiencies. Attributing some of the 
problems to "a new American-style materialism that their parents cannot 
satisfy," speakers also said that many parents' long work hours prevented them 
from spending enough time with their children. 
</P>
<P>
"If we only think of getting rich, then we will lose our children," said Linh 
Tran. "They will become uncontrollable and they will turn around and wreck our 
wealth."

SMALL PUBLISHER MAY TRY TAKEOVER OF GRADCO SYSTEMS 
</P>

<P>
In a challenge to a proposed management-led leveraged buyout of Gradco Systems 
Inc., a small New York City publisher said Tuesday it has acquired a 6.3% stake 
in the office equipment maker and may try to take over the company. 
</P>
<P>
Plenum Publishing Corp., a publisher of scientific books and journals, revealed 
its Gradco holdings in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The disclosure comes less than two weeks after Gradco Chairman Keith B. Stewart 
said he was having difficulty coming up with funding for his proposed buyout of 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
A group led by Plenum, and including Plenum Chairman Martin E. Tash and other 
company officers, began buying Gradco shares on Sept. 29, the day after Stewart 
announced that he was trying to put together a buyout of the company. 
</P>
<P>
According to the filing, Plenum said it decided to invest in Gradco in order to 
profit from the proposed management buyout. But when Stewart announced Dec. 1 
that he was having trouble financing the deal, the group decided it would act 
to "maximize shareholder values." 
</P>
<P>
The New York firm paid $6.8 million to acquire the Gradco shares, which were 
purchased between Sept. 29 and Dec. 5 at prices ranging from $11.62 per share 
to $18.87 per share, the filing said. 
</P>
<P>
In over-the counter trading Tuesday, Gradco's shares closed at $11.625, up 37.5 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
Gradco officials could not be reached for comment and Plenum officials declined 
to comment beyond the SEC filing. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Kilpatrick, president of Newport Securities Corp., a Costa Mesa investment 
firm, said a hostile takeover of Gradco would be difficult because Stewart and 
other company insiders own 16% of the firm's stock. 
</P>
<P>
By failing to complete its offer for the company, Kilpatrick said, Gradco 
management attracted attention to the company and made itself vulnerable to a 
takeover bid from an outside party. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was founded in 1946, Plenum has focused on scientific publications, 
particularly the English translations of Russian technical journals. The 
company, which has 300 employees, had 1988 sales of about $40 million. A Plenum 
spokesman said the company had total assets of $126 million for the period 
ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Plenum is no neophyte in the corporate takeover game. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the publishing company made an unsuccessful bid to take over Arthur D. 
Little, a New York consulting company. Plenum abandoned the effort after 
Little's board and controlling shareholder rejected the $128-million offer.

S&amp;L LAYOFFS MIRROR EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH NEW U.S. RULES 
</P>

The toll from the devastating losses in the savings and loan industry is 
measured not only in the more than $166-billion cost to taxpayers to resolve 
failed thrifts. It is also measured by the jobs that employees lose as healthy 
S&amp;Ls reduce expenses to survive. 
</P>
<P>
The recent layoffs of seven employees at FarWest Savings &amp; Loan in Newport 
Beach and the prospect of more lost jobs there is typical of what many thrifts 
nationwide are doing to comply with new financial requirements imposed by a 
recent federal law. 
</P>
<P>
About a third of the nation's S&amp;Ls, including at least four Orange County 
thrifts, are not expected to meet the three new tests for levels of capital, an 
institution's final reserve against losses. In addition, the federal 
financial-institutions law enacted in August forces S&amp;Ls to sell their 
high-risk corporate securities, known as junk bonds, within five years. 
</P>
<P>
The capital requirements and the junk bond ban have hit FarWest hard. The 
S&amp;L lost $22.9 million in the third quarter, mainly from writing down the 
value of its junk bonds, and it doesn't meet two of the three capital tests. It 
may need as much as $75 million in new capital to meet one of the tests. 
Meanwhile, losses are expected to continue in this quarter. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest is still a solvent, going concern, but it still had to act quickly to 
maintain its health, according to acting president Charles H. Green. 
</P>
<P>
So the S&amp;L, which is controlled by the wealthy Belzberg brothers from 
Canada, took a classic approach: It started cutting back on assets to increase 
its ratio of capital to assets. It already had canceled dividends so that it 
could plow any earnings back into capital to boost those ratios. 
</P>
<P>
But cutting back the S&amp;L's assets and revenue can't be done without paring 
liabilities as well, Green said. "The law of economics forces us to focus on 
expenses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So two weeks ago, layoff notices were sent to seven FarWest employees in the 
marketing unit. That operation, Green said, was "a luxury we no longer can 
afford." And more layoffs among the thrift's 730 workers will follow, he added. 
</P>
<P>
How many more will depend on how small the S&amp;L must become to comply with 
federal law. The institution plans to end the year with $4.5 billion in assets, 
a $300-million drop from its peak, and it may fall to $3.5 billion or lower. 
</P>
<P>
"Down the road, those who survive will have to become more efficient," he said.

THOMAS BROS. MOVES INTO COMPUTER-GENERATED MAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Thomas Bros., the venerable map maker that has has helped guide generations of 
Southern California drivers, will enter the high-tech era today with the 
release of its first book of fully computer-generated maps. 
</P>
<P>
The new guide for Sacramento is the first product of a three-year effort by 
Thomas Bros. to develop a system for electronically storing and updating the 
millions of pieces of information that go into a street map. 
</P>
<P>
The first Los Angeles and Orange counties guide to use the new system will be 
published in about a year. Warren Wilson, president and chief executive officer 
of Thomas Bros., said the company hopes to have all of its 24 map books 
computerized within two years. 
</P>
<P>
The Sacramento guide features a new, brighter cover, and is slightly larger 
than the traditional guide. 
</P>
<P>
The map pages have a cleaner look, with more color and better graphics, and the 
text is larger and easier to read. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said Sacramento is serving as a trial site for the new format because it 
has the right mix of characteristics and is not an important market for the 
company, which serves every county in California and several other areas in 
western states. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Bros.' digital mapping system converts geographical information from 
aerial photographs into millions of bits of information that can be stored and 
manipulated by a computer. Once the basic data is in the system, it can be 
augmented or amended easily with a few keystrokes. 
</P>
<P>
Even more important, having a computer database of map information will enable 
Thomas Bros. to generate special-purpose maps and other information that might 
be useful to businesses, government agencies, universities or individuals. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Wilson said the company would be using data collected in the 
1990 census and combining it with its map information to produce maps showing 
the demographic characteristics of areas. 
</P>
<P>
The company has set up a new subsidiary, called Thomas Bros. Information 
Systems, to develop and market specialized products derived from the master 
database. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be moving into these ancillary product areas as well as publishing 
traditional guides," Wilson said. "We expect the major growth of Thomas Bros. 
to come from Thomas Bros. Information Systems." 
</P>
<P>
He said Thomas Bros. has invested $3 million to $4 million thus far in 
developing the digital mapping system, and added that the company now had the 
"leading position in the United States in computerized mapping of a book of 
this quality." 
</P>
<P>
One of Thomas Bros.' biggest concerns in launching the new guides is that they 
will use a new page and grid system that will not correspond to the old system. 
For customers who count on the Thomas Bros. reference points to find a 
location, the guide provides a conversion chart, and the company has 
established a toll-free phone number to respond to any questions.

Fluor Ups Dividend: Responding to improved earnings, the Fluor Corp. board of 
directors on Tuesday declared a 50% increase in its quarterly shareholder cash 
dividend to 6 cents a share from 4 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Irvine-based engineering and construction company on Jan. 16 
will distribute $4.8 million to owners of company common stock as of Dec. 26, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1987, when Fluor had suffered large losses because of a plunge in 
orders for petroleum-related projects, it suspended dividends. As Fluor 
reorganized and its business picked up, it reinstated the dividend at 2 cents a 
share in September of 1988, raising it to 4 cents a share last March.

General Motors is trying to stuff a bigger air conditioner into its cars, while 
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph is revising decades-old assembly-line 
practices.

The changes come as industry, under pressure from government and 
environmentalists, seeks to eliminate the use of chlorofluorocarbons, the 
one-time wonder chemicals that have been destroying the Earth's ozone layer.

<P>
But the task is more complicated than simply replacing an old chemical with a

environmental manager for the Freon Division at Du Pont, a major producer of 
CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
CFCs, discovered in 1928, help cool houses in the summer and keep them warm in 
the winter. They are used to make the foam cushions on couches, in pillows -- 
even in stuffed toys. 
</P>
<P>
Without them, refrigerators would not cool, and radios, televisions, stereos 
and home computers might not work as well. 
</P>
<P>
The Dark Side 
</P>
<P>
But CFCs also have a dark side: When they float 10 to 30 miles above the Earth 
to the stratosphere, their chlorine component eats away at the ozone shield 
that protects against the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial nations want to ban all CFC production within the next decade. But 
while half a dozen or more replacements are under study, they all have some 
drawbacks and no single substitute is expected to be found. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's going to be a substitute that is going to be given an 
A+" on all areas of concern, said Eileen Claussen, director of atmospheric and 
indoor air programs at the federal Environmental Protection Agency. "We're 
going to have to make some trade-offs." 
</P>
<P>
The EPA is examining the array of substitutes, mainly a family of chemicals 
called HCFCs, to determine whether they are toxic or pose other health concerns 
and how significantly they harm the environment. The HCFCs also deplete ozone 
but much less severely. 
</P>
<P>
"We clearly do not want to blunder along and create a new health or 
environmental problem while solving the ones that we targeted," said Charles 
Elkins, whose EPA office is reviewing the potential toxicity of some CFC 
substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Every year more than 2 billion pounds of CFCs are produced worldwide, a third 
of them in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The United States banned used of the chemical in aerosol cans in 1978, four 
years after the first concerns about the ozone layer were raised. Still, the 
operation of more than $135 billion worth of equipment nationwide is dependent 
on CFCs. 
</P>
<P>
Industry turned to CFCs because they do not burn or corrode metal, pose no 
direct health hazards to workers, and hold heat and cold, making them ideal 
insulators. 
</P>
<P>
That was before their threat to the ozone layer was understood. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the ozone over Antarctica was destroyed during September and October of 
1987, causing a hole in the Earth's protective shield that closes and reappears 
with the seasons. Severe destruction of the ozone layer is believed to be 
occurring over the South Pole again this year, according to scientists. They 
say the conditions for ozone destruction are present over the Arctic, although 
no massive loss of ozone has been observed there. 
</P>
<P>
Firms Bite Bullet 
</P>
<P>
Several large corporations have announced plans to end their reliance on CFCs, 
some by the early 1990s. These include such giants as AT&amp;T, IBM, Boeing and 
General Electric. 
</P>
<P>
"We have used CFC solvents and cleaners for so long they're almost ingrained in 
the manufacturing process," says David Chittick, vice president for environment 
and safety at AT&amp;T. Nevertheless, AT&amp;T hopes to end all uses of CFCs by 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
The major auto makers are developing substitutes and are designing new 
air-conditioning units to accommodate the changeover, probably in the 
mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
But the new air conditioners will be less energy-efficient and require larger 
compressors, experts say. "We feel we can do it without any dramatic effects on 
the look or design of the car. It's going to be difficult though," says Toni 
Simonetti, a GM spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is considering legislation calling for the elimination of CFCs by the 
year 2000 and at least 20 states are reviewing proposals aimed at curbing CFC 
pollution. Vermont has banned the use of CFCs in auto air conditioners after 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
Du Pont has spent more than $100 million on research for CFC substitutes and 
estimates that it will spend as much as $1 billion to build production plants 
and to cover other costs during a 10-year transition period. ICI Americas, 
another major manufacturer, also has spent $100 million in CFC replacement 
research and recently announced plans to begin production of a substitute 
cooling agent by 1992 at a new Louisiana plant. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting the Demand 
</P>
<P>
But developing substitute chemicals will not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
As much as 30% of today's CFC demand will have to be eliminated by conservation 
and recycling, government and industry experts say. Major appliance 
manufacturers as well as auto makers recently have supplied their repair shops 
with equipment to capture CFCs rather than let the old coolant vent into the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
But EPA and industry officials acknowledge that routine venting of old CFCs is 
still widespread. 
</P>
<P>
Shifts to new manufacturing procedures or altogether new technology could 
account for a 30% reduction in CFC demand, especially in the electronics 
industry, the experts say. 
</P>
<P>
But some critics say that industry is slow to accept new technology. "What 
we're facing is inertia," says Marc Goldberg of Crynodynamics, a New 
Jersey-based company that is producing a refrigeration system using helium as a 
cooling agent. The system is being marketed primarily for commercial uses. The 
major auto makers have expressed little interest. 
</P>
<P>
Companies such as AT&amp;T and Northern Telecom are turning to new 
manufacturing procedures such as using low-solids fluxes to reduce leftover 
residues and eliminate the need for CFCs as a solvent for cleaning circuit 
boards after soldering. 
</P>
<P>
"This (CFC problem) has caused a whole new review of the way we do business," 
says A.D. Fitzgerald, director of environmental affairs at Northern Telecom, a 
Canadian-based manufacturer of telephone equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The thorniest problems have emerged in the area of refrigeration and air 
conditioning because all substitutes under consideration pose energy and 
environmental trade-offs, particularly in the area of global warming.

MTV CHANGES FORMAT, MIXING FULL-LENGTH SHOWS, MUSIC VIDEOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITERTelevision: The outlaw rock-music channel will 
announce the inclusion of several 'customized' series during the Western Cable 
Show in Anaheim. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MTV -- the cable channel that made a business and a pop-culture art form out of 
quick-hit music videos -- is moving away from its original all-video format. 
</P>
<P>
Expanding a recent trend toward full-length shows on the rock-music channel, 
MTV in January will launch several new series, from a morning program hosted by 
a male-female duo to "vidcoms" (a hybrid of comedy and music videos). The new 
shows are designed to appeal to viewers throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to have hosts and shows that differentiate MTV in the morning from 
MTV at night, the way that NBC viewers know that they're going to see Bryant 
Gumbel in the morning and Tom Brokaw at night," Doug Herzog, senior vice 
president in charge of programming for MTV, said in an interview Tuesday. 
"Music videos will still represent 90% of our programming. But instead of 
having random videos, we'll be customizing shows and hosts to improve our 
presentation to the audience who's out there." 
</P>
<P>
The changes, Herzog emphasized, are evolutionary, not revolutionary -- which, 
in terms of MTV's outlaw image with young people, would mean turning it into 
conventional network TV. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Dayparting' does represent a bit of maturing on our part," he said, 
referring to the practice of offering different types of programs at different 
times of the day, "but we're never going to be all-programmed like the networks 
because we're driven by music videos. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made frequent changes in MTV because, in effect, we've promised our 
viewers that we won't be the same today as we were five years ago. Part of 
these changes simply come from the fact that we didn't want to enter the next 
decade looking the way we did during the last decade." 
</P>
<P>
Although MTV is seen in some 48 million homes in the United States and has 
expanded to 26 foreign countries, its new programming strategy may give MTV a 
way not only to stay fresh but also to encourage viewers to stay tuned. 
"There's a lot of grazing and zapping out there among TV viewers," Herzog 
acknowledged. "We want to keep people interested between the videos." 
</P>
<P>
MTV is announcing its new overall scheduling strategy this week to cable 
operators at the Western Cable Show in Anaheim, which opens today. Sometime 
next week, the cable network is expected to sign the co-hosts who will 
introduce the videos and do comedy on a new early morning show. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope it will be like Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford on bad coffee," 
Herzog said. "The premise of the comedy is that she's a morning person, and 
he's not, so he may seemingly stumble into the studio -- or sleep through the 
show altogether." 
</P>
<P>
From 8 to 11 p.m., MTV will introduce a new three-hour programming block to 
counterprogram prime time on the commercial networks. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the place where we'll be emphasizing breaking new videos and news from 
the music world," Herzog said. The hosts for the show have not yet been named. 
</P>
<P>
Among the new "vidcoms" that will be introduced for the 7 p.m. time slot are 
two shows designed as an off-center version of ABC's "Wide World of Sports": 
"Kevin Seal: Sporting Fool," starring a comedian who does unusual sports, such 
as bungee-jumping, and "Colin Quinn's Manly World," with real athletes joining 
the comedian-host.

Cypress College's "A Christmas Carol: Scrooge and Marley" seems designed 
primarily for a youthful audience. Director Mark Majarian has brought in a 
bagful of special effects. Bells gong loudly, shrieks and yelps echo; there are 
demons with incandescent peepers, and spirits enshrouded in stage fog. 
</P>
<P>
Along these lines, Gil Morales' set has the perspective of a children's 
nightmare: The large cut-out scenery is cartoon-like and eerie, all flinty 
grays and drained-out colors. 
</P>
<P>
Even the use of Marley as a narrator -- the major innovation in this Israel 
Horovitz adaptation of Dickens' venerable tale -- appears intended to guide 
children through the story. 
</P>
<P>
Because of these touches, this "Christmas Carol" may succeed at holding some 
young kids, but their parents and older siblings are likely to fidget. Despite 
all the gee-whiz moments, the production simply doesn't involve as well as it 
should. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few central problems. The first revolves around Majarian's decision 
to use all of the Campus Theatre's large stage. This makes some sense during 
the big crowd scenes. But the more intimate passages, when we're supposed to 
grasp Scrooge's personality, are all but lost, swallowed by the expanse. Even 
on the big stage, Majarian might have blocked the actors and sets nearer to the 
audience. As it is now, though, the action is removed several feet from the 
front row. 
</P>
<P>
Another glitch: From where I sat, a gap in the scenery, toward the side, 
allowed a distracting view of the cast preparing backstage. 
</P>
<P>
A bigger problem: Too many scenes are allowed to lag. The actors move about 
doing this and that, but they don't push the action along. A prime example is 
when Scrooge all but cleans house in the long moments before Marley's first 
midnight visitation. We grow impatient; let those Christmas ghosts get on with 
it! 
</P>
<P>
Timothy D. French's Scrooge looks too young, even with makeup and gray powder 
dusted in his hair. A Cypress College student, French does try to lend the 
character age and severity through a hobbled gait and biting manner, but it 
doesn't always work. It's an impression of Scrooge, not an embodiment. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, Ernest Jackson has the tougher role as Marley. The character 
hovers between a ghostly presence out to frighten (Jackson comes up with a lot 
of those maniacal laughs) and a hopeful moralist commenting on Scrooge's 
soulful journey. It puts Jackson at a disadvantage, as he has trouble combining 
the two. 
</P>

'TELL' TO BE DISMANTLED; PRESERVATION STILL UNCERTAIN

"The Tell" is due to be dismantled and removed from its site along Laguna 
Canyon Road by Jan. 15. Project co-organizer Mark Chamberlain wants to see 
parts of the giant photomural preserved and has written to a number of 
institutions, but so far he has raised no interest. 
</P>
<P>
Composed of tens of thousands of donated family snapshots glued to a plywood 
structure more than 600 feet long, the mural was created to symbolize 
opposition to development of the largely pristine canyon. The work was the 
centerpiece of a protest walk Nov. 11 that drew a crowd estimated at more than 
7,000. (The protests apparently have been heard: The Irvine Co. has agreed to 
consider relocating the huge Laguna Laurel housing and commercial project that 
it had planned for the canyon). 
</P>
<P>
"The Tell" originally was scheduled to come down in September, but city 
officials have allowed it to remain until insurance on it runs out. Chamberlain 
and volunteers will begin dismantling it Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain said he would like to see portions of the mural acquired by a 
museum "so that if there's any heritage in this piece, it will be preserved." 
Nancy Coop of the Laguna Art Museum confirmed that the museum had received such 
a proposal from Chamberlain but has no plans to comply. 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain has proposed cutting some parts of the mural into small sections 
and selling them to "recoup some of the expenses" of building it and to benefit 
groups working to preserve Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"There's this guy in Texas who offered to buy the Berlin Wall" and resell it in 
sections, Chamberlain noted.

JAMES FLANIGAN: INVESTMENT ISN'T A GOOD REASON TO BUY ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What does it tell you that Old Master paintings have gone up in value twice as 
fast as common stocks in 1989? Or that last year, too, Old Masters -- pre-1800 
paintings by prominent European artists -- had a greater rise than stocks, 
according to Salomon Bros., the investment firm that keeps tabs on paintings 
and sculpture as well as stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
One thing it tells you is that there are a lot of rich individuals in the 
world, more in the last decade than ever before. But whether art is a good 
investment is another matter, despite the fabulous prices being paid for 
Picassos and Van Goghs. 
</P>
<P>
First the money. The 1980s has seen an upsurge in individual wealth, as stock 
prices have more than trebled since 1982 in the United States and risen more 
than that in Japan, where a long boom in real estate has also made land and 
property owners extremely rich. 
</P>
<P>
And lately some of that money has been showing up in art sales. "The market for 
works priced between $1 million and $20 million is especially strong," says 
Bonnie Barrett Stretch, editor of the ArtNewsletter, who calls that the "middle 
market." 
</P>
<P>
The higher-priced market has been simply spectacular. At the end of November, 
for example, the owner of a Tokyo auto-racing park paid $48.9 million for a 
Picasso painting -- bidding through a closed-circuit television link between 
Paris and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a global business," says Salomon Bros. art analyst Harvey Katz, who 
estimates that Sotheby's and Christie's, the chief auction houses, move about 
$4.5 billion in art objects each year. And that amounts to less than half the 
total market, because most buying and selling is done privately through 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
It's an exclusive market. Citibank has set up an art advisory service to help 
its private banking clients -- net worth $1 million and up -- with valuations 
of art works and advice about collections. 
</P>
<P>
Yet in some ways it's a mass market. Sotheby's boasts that while it auctions 
300 art works each year at prices over $1 million apiece, it moves 230,000 
works at prices under $10,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
So should you try for a killing in art -- inspired perhaps by the example of 
Wendell Cherry, the president of Humana Inc., who bought a painting titled "Yo! 
Picasso!" for $5.6 million in 1981 and sold it this year for $47.8 million? 
</P>
<P>
No, say seasoned pros in the worlds of art and finance. "With notable 
exceptions for particular objects and timing, art has not been a good 
investment," says Henry King, who heads Citibank's art advisory service. 
Paintings pay no dividends and cost money to hold -- for insurance or storage. 
And transaction costs are stiff: Both buyers and sellers pay 10% commissions at 
art auctions; dealer markups can be much more in private sales. 
</P>
<P>
And the market is treacherous for the unwary. Forbes magazine recently quoted 
an art expert ridiculing tennis star John McEnroe for paying $350,000 for a 
second-rate example of Renoir's work. (Yes, there are second-rate Renoirs). 
</P>
<P>
The market can even be treacherous for the wisest collectors. A Rembrandt owned 
by Norton Simon is now under a cloud because a Dutch government examination of 
the painter's works has cast doubt on its authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, art values often lag the returns of other investments, and sometimes 
don't even keep up with inflation. Bruno Frey, professor of economics at the 
University of Zurich, wrote in Art &amp; Antiques magazine recently about the 
British Railways Pension Fund, which began investing a portion of its assets in 
art in 1974, built up a collection and began selling the art works in 1987. The 
fund made good gains: Its art works appreciated 3.5 times. But if the fund had 
invested in common stocks, it would have fared better, wrote Frey -- more than 
four-fold appreciation in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Even the "Yo! Picasso!" that brought Wendell Cherry such a profit in the 1980s, 
brought a net loss to its owner in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
So why do rich folks collect? Many reasons. Art adds class, for one thing. 
"It's a way of making new money into old money," observes one expert. 
</P>
<P>
But what begins as a quest for status sometimes develops into true intellectual 
interest. The best collectors specialize in a specific style of art, often 
becoming scholars. That is how valuable collections are built. In one sense the 
spirit that drives collectors, and swells the art market today, is the same one 
that is bringing record attendance to U.S. museums -- a seeking for knowledge 
so strong and widespread that it amounts to a trend in this country. In fact, 
predicts futurologist John Naisbitt in his forthcoming book "Megatrends 2000," 
museum attendance in the 1990s will surpass that of ballparks in America. 
</P>
<P>
So what does all this tell you about investing in art? Buy what you enjoy; if 
you want to support a local artist by purchasing his or her work, fine. But 
keep in mind that the work's real value may be intangible.

BEAR STEARNS SAYS IT PLANS TO RESUME PROGRAM TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that some industry executives called "shocking," Bear, Stearns &amp; 
Co. said it will resume computer-driven program trading for its own account, 
regardless of public and industry outcry denouncing the practice. 
</P>
<P>
The New York-based investment firm was the first major Wall Street house to 
return to the controversial trading strategy, which has been blamed as one 
cause of dramatic swings in stock prices. Bear Stearns never stopped program 
trading for its clients' accounts but briefly banned the trading for its own 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Program trading, the most common form of which is called index arbitrage, 
generally is used to exploit minute price differences between stock index 
futures and the underlying stocks. It is typically used by large institutions 
that trade in volume. It has been a concern because it can cause huge blocks of 
stock to be bought or sold at once, which, in turn, can cause wide swings in 
stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
Those wide swings -- graphically illustrated during the October, 1987, crash 
and last October's 190-point downturn -- are widely blamed for scaring small 
investors away from Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1987 market crash, several big brokerage houses -- including 
Prudential-Bache, Paine Webber, Morgan Stanley and Shearson Lehman Hutton -- 
stopped program trading for their own accounts. And after last October's 
downturn, several of these firms stopped program trading even on behalf of 
their clients. 
</P>
<P>
Bear Stearns Chief Executive Alan C. Greenberg said his company had returned to 
the practice because "it is a necessary thing to do." Index arbitrage is not 
likely to be banned, he noted, and it can be highly profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the controversy surrounding program trading, Greenberg said: "I 
have had 50 calls today, and all of them have been congratulatory. Institutions 
think this is a fabulous thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
However, several industry executives said they were horrified by Bear Stearns' 
move. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it appalling in light of the criticism that has been levied on the 
practice, not only by investors and clients but also by the industry itself, 
that Bear Stearns would do this," said Donald Crowell, managing partner of 
Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co., a regional stock brokerage headquartered in Los 
Angeles. "Program trading serves absolutely no purpose except to create profits 
for a few large investors at the expense of individual investors. It should be 
abolished." 
</P>
<P>
But Bear Stearns said it will "self-impose" several standards aimed at reducing 
volatility, including banning such trades if the Dow Jones industrial average 
is down more than 50 points and strictly observing "circuit breakers," a 
practice that halts trading once stock prices have dropped below a set level. 
</P>
<P>
It said it will also use program trading to sell stocks only on price "upticks" 
-- that is, when a stock trades at a higher price than the previous 
transaction. A so-called uptick rule requiring program trades to be executed 
only after an uptick has been proposed as a way to avoid market free falls. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some don't believe these safeguards are enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I am glad they did it this way rather than with no restraints at all, but I 
don't want to rely on volunteerism to regulate the market," said Lawrence 
Zicklin, managing partner with Neuberger &amp; Berman in New York. 
</P>
<P>
And others said they were so vehemently opposed to program trading that they 
would stop doing business with Bear Stearns, regardless of the restraints. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't do any business with any money manager or any corporation that has 
anything to do with program trading," said Charles Wohlstetter, chairman of 
Atlanta-based Contel Corp. "I was always taught that the idea was not to take 
the last nickel you can. It was take a little and leave a little. Play fair. I 
am buried in letters from people who castigate this practice."

JAPANESE UNVEIL PLAN TO EXPAND CHIP PURCHASES; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: THE 10-POINT PROPOSAL IS DESIGNED TO HELP SMALLER FIRMS GET A 
HIGHER SHARE OF JAPAN'S MICROCHIP MARKET.

Japanese microchip makers unveiled a plan Tuesday to help smaller foreign firms 
sell chips here, trying to extend the recent success bigger firms have had in 
selling to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-point outline by the Electronic Industries Assn. of Japan offers few new 
ideas. But it does endorse for the first time some of the cooperative measures 
that have helped large firms gain access to the market. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until now it has been the big companies that have expanded their market 
shares. We must broaden this to include small- and medium-sized firms," Akio 
Tanii, president of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Semiconductor Industry Assn., due to debate the proposal Tuesday, has 
in the past said access in Japan has improved for bigger firms with the money 
and manpower to muscle into the world's most competitive market. 
</P>
<P>
But it complained that smaller foreign firms still faced discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"This is good news. They are making it easier for smaller firms to get over 
here," said David Hytha, managing director of AT&amp;T Microelectronics, a 
division of AT&amp;T Japan Ltd., a wholly owned unit of American Telephone 
&amp; Telegraph Co. 
</P>
<P>
But Hytha added that improved access by smaller firms would do little to boost 
the foreign share of Japan's market, now at 12.0%, according to World 
Semiconductor Trade Statistics data quoted by the EIAJ. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a red herring because the companies with a presence here already 
represent 80% of the sales of U.S. companies," said Hytha, who is also chairman 
of the Japan chapter of the U.S. SIA. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan lists steps Japanese firms could take to boost their sales to 
smaller companies. These include: 
</P>
<P>
* Disclosing technical information to help foreign companies design useful 
microchips. 
</P>
<P>
* Marketing foreign chips through their own distribution channels. 
</P>
<P>
* Furthering technical assistance such as joint ventures and technology 
transfers.

Degradable Plastic Boycott Sought: "Don't get Glad, get mad," two national 
environmental groups declared as they called for a boycott of plastic products 
being marketed as degradable. In a joint report, "Degradable Plastics: the 
Wrong Answer to the Right Question," the Environmental Defense Fund and 
Environmental Action contend that Hefty and Glad trash bags and Nappies and 
Tender Care diapers, among other products made from the new plastics, claim 
environmental benefits that "are either nonexistent or have yet to be 
demonstrated." But the groups' chief objection is that the degradables will 
cripple fledgling attempts to recycle traditional plastic products.

JAPAN CAUTIONS COMPANIES ON OVERSEAS INVESTMENTS

Japan's Ministry of Finance is pressuring Japanese life insurance companies to 
slow investment in overseas real estate, industry sources say, quietly telling 
the insurers to act cautiously and to avoid making high-profile real estate 
deals abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry has denied that it issued a particular warning. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign property purchases by Japanese life insurers have led to criticism in 
some countries, particularly the United States, where some Americans object to 
well-known buildings shifting into foreign hands. There is also concern in some 
countries that Japanese purchases could force real estate prices up. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry is concerned that this criticism could lead to trade friction for 
Japan, industry analysts said. The warning is an attempt to make Japanese 
insurers look less aggressive and conspicuous in their foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
"The MOF (Ministry of Finance) is really sensitive about overseas real estate 
investment by us at present," said an assistant manager of international 
business and planning at one major life insurer. "The MOF advice does not mean 
to stop buying real estate overseas. They just expect us not to take 
high-profile action there but instead to act in a quiet way." 
</P>
<P>
But a ministry official said: "We did not give them a particular warning. We 
have discussions with them in cases where we receive information of planned 
building purchases. We just advise them to be flexible." 
</P>
<P>
The value of overseas real estate held by the Japanese life insurers totaled 
$6.9 billion (1 trillion yen) at the end of June, 1989.

CAMPEAU CORP. REPORTS LOSSES OF $190 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Campeau Corp., an ailing retailing and real estate empire, reported on Tuesday 
that its losses more than doubled in the third quarter to $190 million despite 
a 5% gain in revenue to $2.56 billion. In the same quarter a year earlier, 
Campeau lost $83 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Toronto-based company, the parent of Ralphs supermarkets in Southern 
California, has been struggling under the burden of heavy debt stemming largely 
from its $6.6-billion acquisition in May, 1988, of Federated Department Stores. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Campeau was rescued from the brink of bankruptcy by a 
$250-million loan from Olympia &amp; York Developments, and the company is 
trying to raise cash by selling its prestigious Bloomingdale's department store 
chain. None of the company's nine department store chains are in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau's operating profit for the quarter ended Oct. 31 totaled $255 million, 
off 4% from $265 million a year earlier. Results from Ralphs, which has been 
remodeling many of its stores, contributed somewhat to that decline. The 
Compton-based chain, as previously reported, posted an operating profit of $38 
million, down from $41 million. Analysts say Ralphs has been sheltered from 
Campeau's struggles, however, because it has a separate debt structure and its 
own credit line. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to sound a hopeful note, Campeau noted in a news release that its 
department stores traditionally make 50% of their yearlong profits from holiday 
shopping in the fourth quarter. Company spokesmen were not available for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of the year, Campeau has lost $390 million on revenue 
of $7.04 billion. That compares to a loss of $24 million on revenue of $5.4 
billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Operating profit for the nine months was $680 million, up 56% from $437 
million. The nine- month gains in operating profit and revenue resulted from 
the Federated acquisition.

Schering-Plough to Sell Maybelline: In another sign of the fierce competitive 
forces now shaping the global pharmaceutical industry, Schering-Plough Corp. 
said it would sell its Maybelline cosmetics franchise, the last of the big 
mass-market cosmetics businesses to be put on the block. Schering-Plough said 
it would sell Maybelline, possibly to the unit's management, to focus on its 
prescription and over-the-counter drug, personal-care and vision-care 
businesses. Analysts estimate Maybelline could fetch $420 million to $560 
million, or 1.5 to 2 times its annual sales.

New York Times to Take 4th-Quarter Charge: New York Times Co. will take 
fourth-quarter charges of $30 million before tax to cover staff cuts and $27 
million after tax as a reserve against the company's investment in its forest 
products group. The charges could wipe out expected earnings in the period. The 
company said the before-tax charge is to cover costs for voluntary union staff 
reductions at its flagship New York Times newspaper. Most of the job losses are 
for non-editorial staff. New York Times shares closed up 50 cents at $26.25 on 
the American Stock Exchange.

The stock market closed sharply higher on Wall Street Tuesday after a late 
afternoon rally that traders attributed to a surge among oil issues and 
bargain-hunting among battered technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 23.89 to close at 2,752.13. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 900 issues up, 651 down and 475 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 176.82 million shares, up from Monday's 147.13 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Oil companies accounted for seven of the 13 most actively traded issues on the 
Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips Petroleum and Exxon traded the most heavily, with Phillips up 1 3/8 to 
25 7/8 and Exxon up 1 1/2 to 51 1/4. Phillips' rise was attributed to a 
$250-million stock buyback announcement Monday and a higher earnings estimate 
for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Among other oil issues, Pennzoil gained 1 3/8 to 87 5/8, Royal Dutch Petroleum 
shot up 3 1/4 to 76 3/4, Mobil increased 1 5/8 to 63, Texaco gained 1 1/2 to 57 
1/8, Chevron rose 1 1/4 to 68 1/8 and Unocal was 1 1/2 higher to 30 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed mixed in dull trading as 
speculators pulled back from a strong morning rally because of a lack of fresh 
incentives. The Nikkei 225-share average rose 50.86 points to 37,803.53. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks rose in heavy volume, reflecting a strong response to the 
debut of trading in Britain's privatized water companies. The Financial Times 
100-share index ended 12.1 points higher at 2,363.5.

Bond Prices Ignore Weakness in Dollar 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were little changed in light trading, largely shrugging off 
weakness in the dollar and a big jump in stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond fell 1/32 point, or 31 cents per $1,000 in face 
value, while its yield edged up to 7.89% from 7.88% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said trading was lackluster as dealers awaited the government's latest 
data on producer prices, merchandise trade and industrial production, due out 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Those reports are expected to shed more light on the economy's direction, and 
subsequently, the Federal Reserve's policy on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Any weakness in bonds came from the stock market's rise and softness in the 
dollar, but there was little movement of any kind, said Jay Goldinger, chief 
market strategist for Capital Insight Inc. in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
unchanged from Monday at 8.438%.

Dollar Hits 1-Year Low Against Mark 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's mark dominated foreign exchange trading Tuesday, strengthening 
on firm interest rates in that country and talk of a reunified Germany that 
helped sharply depress the dollar and other currencies. In both New York and 
Europe, the dollar hit a one-year low against the mark, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
"The scenario here is that interest rates in Germany will stay firm . . . while 
U.S. rates are trending down because the economy is slowing," said Earl I. 
Johnson, a currency trader at Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so much the dollar's weakness as it is the mark's strength. The mark 
is the place to be right now." 
</P>
<P>
The mark has risen sharply in recent weeks amid rapid political and economic 
reforms in East Germany. Traders speculate that West Germany's economy will 
flourish, pushing interest rates higher, as boundaries between East and West 
Germany diminish. 
</P>
<P>
High interest rates tend to support a currency. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted in London at 1.7335 marks, off from 1.7660 marks late 
Monday, and in New York at 1.73225 marks, down from 1.7610. Both closing rates 
were the lowest since December, 1988, according to traders. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar also dipped below 6.00 French francs for the first time since Dec. 
16, 1988, finishing at 5.9275 francs in Europe, down from 6.0370 francs late 
Monday. It finished at 5.9185 francs in New York, down from 6.0200. 
</P>
<P>
Against the British pound, the dollar also weakened. Sterling rose to $1.6027 
from $1.5895 in London late Monday, and $1.6085 from $1.5937 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
fell 0.18 yen to close at 144.47 yen.

Gold Inches Closer to High for the Year 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures prices inched nearer to new highs for the year on New York's 
Commodity Exchange after taking a quick breather from their energetic advance 
of the previous five sessions. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, silver futures slipped; oil futures were mostly 
lower; grains and soybeans were mixed, and livestock and meat futures were 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled 80 cents to $1.10 higher, with the contract for delivery 
in December up $1.10 at $417.90 an ounce, just $1.80 shy of the 1989 high of 
$419.70 set Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Gold has rallied from $401 an ounce in the past six sessions. But the bulls 
appeared to be weakening early in Tuesday's back-and-forth trading, which saw 
the December contract dip as low as $415.30 before recovering late in the 
session. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said investors were drawn from the gold market by strong advances in 
the stock market and in the British pound and West German mark.

JMB Realty Corp. reportedly is bidding for Bloomingdale's department stores and 
Hilton Hotels Corp., and an industry analyst said Tuesday that both properties 
would mesh with the international firm's expansion strategy. 
</P>
<P>
JMB, a real estate investment, management and development firm, is one of at 
least six bidders for all or part of Hilton, which went on the market in May, 
the Wall Street Journal reported in Tuesday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Tribune reported that JMB -- which owns a glitzy downtown mall 
anchored by Bloomingdale's Chicago store -- is among several bidders for the 
17-store chain. 
</P>
<P>
Burton Glazov, JMB's executive director, declined to comment on the reports. 
</P>
<P>
JMB already owns the Liberty House retail chain in Hawaii and several hotels, 
including the Century Plaza in Los Angeles.

REPORT OF NEW TAKEOVER PLAN LIFTS UAL STOCK

Shares of UAL Corp. closed higher Tuesday following a published report that 
United Airlines management has crafted a tentative, employee-led leveraged 
buyout bid valued at up to $240 a share, or about $5.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
UAL rose $2.75 to finish at $176.25 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. A 
UAL spokeswoman declined to comment on the report or the stock move. 
</P>
<P>
However, takeover stock traders said they doubted whether any proposal for the 
Chicago-based airline company will be completed in time for consideration 
during a board meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said UAL rose on a report in the Chicago Tribune that cited 
unidentified sources as saying United's management has come up with a buyout 
proposal worth up to $240 a share. 
</P>
<P>
UAL's management has been struggling to craft a new buyout for the airline's 
parent since a planned bid of $300 a share, or $6.75 billion, led by UAL 
management and pilots fell apart in October after the group failed to secure 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago-based company is under pressure to shape a new bid because Coniston 
Partners, a New York investment firm, has threatened to take control of UAL's 
board and push through a restructuring or other deal to boost its stock price. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said there is speculation that the new buyout proposal might 
entail an offer in which each UAL share would be exchanged for up to $200 in 
cash and securities with a face value of about $40 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, UAL employees would own about two-thirds of the company and 
public shareholders about one-third after a buyout, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
It also said that under the plan, management would invest $30 million for a 2% 
stake in the airline company and would be granted options for another 6%. 
</P>
<P>
The chief difficulties in wrapping up a deal reportedly have been enlisting the 
support of United's machinists and flight attendants unions and persuading 
banks to finance a transaction.

BIG PROFITS IN BRITAIN AFTER WATER UTILITY PRIVATIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Britain's water companies made a big splash on London's stock market Tuesday as 
some of the 2.7 million investors who bought stock in 10 companies in England 
and Wales reaped instant profits when the shares began trading. 
</P>
<P>
The controversial selloff of the companies was the latest in Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher's sweeping privatization program and the third biggest after 
British Petroleum and British Gas. Water utilities in Northern Ireland and 
Scotland were not included in the offer. 
</P>
<P>
The $8.4-billion (5.25 billion pounds) flotation had 5.7 orders for each share 
offered. Delighted government officials hailed the demand for the stocks as a 
reaffirmation of popular capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
It was at one time the most unpopular of Thatcher's privatizations because 
feelings ran high about putting the water authorities in private hands. 
</P>
<P>
But an attractive offer price, a promise of lucrative dividends and generous 
incentives, coupled with easy payment, turned what some analysts had predicted 
would be a potential flop into a roaring success. 
</P>
<P>
Northumbrian Water Group was the star performer, surging to $2.72 (1.70 
pounds), compared to the $1.60 (1 pound) price at which the government sold 
each share. 
</P>
<P>
Other water companies made 64 cents (40 pence) or so on paper for their new 
owners, but many investors could not take profits immediately because share 
certificates will only be sent out Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Any purchaser of the new shares can trade them before he or she receives the 
certificate.

VITAMIN D MAY BE CANCER FIGHTER, UCSD STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maintaining high blood levels of a certain Vitamin D compound might reduce the 
risk of developing colorectal cancer by as much as 80%, according to results of 
a joint study conducted by UC San Diego's School of Medicine and Johns Hopkins 
School of Hygiene and Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
Colorectal, or colon, cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the 
United States, with more than 150,000 new cases and 61,000 deaths reported each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The risk of developing colon cancer seems to be "strongly related to sunlight 
exposure and dietary sources of vitamin D," according to UCSD Professor Cedric 
Garland, principal author of the study described in the Nov. 18 issue of The 
Lancet, a British medical journal. 
</P>
<P>
Garland on Tuesday cautioned against consuming large amounts of vitamin D in 
pill form because the vitamin is toxic in high doses. The specific vitamin D 
compound described in the study could best be increased by drinking fortified 
milk and eating fish such as tuna and salmon, Garland said. 
</P>
<P>
The research described in The Lancet article drew cautious optimism Tuesday 
from the medical community. 
</P>
<P>
The findings are "not yet supported by any other groups at this time," 
according to Dr. Paul Goldfarb, a past president of the San Diego unit of the 
American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to think that eating (healthy foods) and leading a moderate life 
could reduce the risk of colon cancer," Goldfarb said Tuesday. "But what people 
need to understand is that, in the here and now, the way we find colon cancer 
is . . . (through) physical examinations. The ACS recommends that Americans 
begin having colon examinations at age 50." 
</P>
<P>
Cancer Society guidelines suggest that Americans can best avoid colon cancer by 
maintaining appropriate body weight, exercising regularly, drinking alcohol in 
moderation, and increasing the consumption of fruit, vegetables and whole 
grains. 
</P>
<P>
"A paper like this does draw attention to the possible role of vitamin D in 
colon cancers," said Diane Birt, a nutritional biochemist at the University of 
Nebraska Medical School's Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer. "But it's 
only preliminary evidence, and it's important to remember that vitamin D is 
extremely toxic, especially for youngsters and infants. 
</P>
<P>
"Given (the ACS guidelines), what Garland is suggesting falls within a normal, 
healthy diet," Birt said. 
</P>
<P>
Garland said the research was based on blood samples drawn from 25,620 healthy 
men and women in 1974. The blood was frozen until this year, when researchers 
thawed samples from 34 patients who developed colorectal cancer and 67 
"control" volunteers who had not developed cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who developed colon cancer were deficient in vitamin D," Garland said. 
"The laboratory data provide the most direct, conclusive evidence to date, and 
make an exceptionally strong case for the protective effects of vitamin D." 
</P>
<P>
"The next step would be clinical trials" to document the vitamin D compound's 
role in reducing the risk of colon cancer, Garland said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd put people who have had colon cancer on vitamin D and see, if over the 
next few years . . . they have a lower incidence of recurrences, complications 
and deaths," Garland said.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: DESPITE TARNISHED IMAGE, COLOR NANCY HUNTER GREEN IN DEL 
MAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is early morning after Nancy Hoover Hunter's conviction for tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
I am in Seagrove Park in Del Mar, in front of a plaque "in grateful 
appreciation" of Hunter's "tireless efforts to preserve Del Mar's open space" 
during her years on the City Council, 1974-82. 
</P>
<P>
I am interviewing joggers and power-walkers to see if support for Hunter has 
dimmed. My small survey shows that it has not. 
</P>
<P>
Before her trial, a Del Mar newspaper ran the headline, "Some Say Hunter Can 
Get Fair Trial." That seems to sum up seaside opinion: She's one of us, and now 
they're after her. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that several people who were fleeced in the J. David &amp; Co. swindle 
live in Del Mar does not seem to have sullied the civic mood. Nancy was a 
"green," a right-thinking environmentalist. 
</P>
<P>
I remember her as a peripheral figure -- in truth, more central than we knew -- 
when her friend and beneficiary, the current talk-show host, ran for mayor. She 
seemed aloof and dreamy. 
</P>
<P>
Later, I read in Don Bauder's tale of J. David, "Captain Money and the Golden 
Girl," that she had smashed Jerry Dominelli's head against a wall during a 
lovers' quarrel. Appearances can be deceiving, I figured. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it that our local malpractitioners -- medical, political or financial -- 
always seem to retain a core of loyalists? 
</P>
<P>
The woods are full of people who feel the ex-mayor was railroaded. Their 
numbers are thinning, but you'll still find some who say C. Arnholt Smith was a 
great man brought down by panicky federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
It's always good for a smug laugh when we read about some politician in New 
Jersey being reelected from behind bars. You'll usually see a mention that the 
locals love him because he improved trash collection. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Hunter case provides a San Diego corollary: We'll forgive anything if 
you bring us open space. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy's Littered Exit Trail 
</P>
<P>
Take our sheriff. Please. 
</P>
<P>
* Sheriff Duffy gets mixed marks for his "You won't have John and his burglar 
alarm to kick around anymore" speech. 
</P>
<P>
Duffy said anyone who trusts newspapers also "believes in the tooth fairy and 
that professional wrestling is real." Professional wrestling not real? 
</P>
<P>
You can bet Duffy wouldn't have said that if he still needed votes in East 
County. Is this how he repays 20 years of faithful support, by mocking a 
cherished belief? 
</P>
<P>
* Duffy also libeled Canis auereus by referring to his would-be successors as 
"jackals who haven't the courage to kill their own prey but rely upon others to 
provide them something to feed upon." 
</P>
<P>
Those are good fighting words but rather poor zoology. Check your encyclopedia. 
</P>
<P>
Jackals have gotten a bum rap. They're major predators of antelopes and other 
jungle things. 
</P>
<P>
The notion that jackals are only scavengers is just a media myth. Surely the 
sheriff can sympathize. 
</P>
<P>
* Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache has gotten his Christmas wish. 
</P>
<P>
Hours before Duffy announced his pullout, Roache had mailed Christmas cards 
with a drawing of a fireplace and nearby Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
Attached to the tree is the note: "Dear Santa, Please bring San Diego County a 
new sheriff in 1990. It's time for a change." 
</P>
<P>
It Wasn't a Party Line 
</P>
<P>
Oops, wrong number. 
</P>
<P>
One reason the Republican Party pulled back from Carol Bentley late in the 
campaign was that a phone poll of several hundred Republicans showed strong 
support for Lucy Killea and her pro-choice views. 
</P>
<P>
The logic was, hey, if the rank-and-file are deserting Bentley, why should the 
party get bloodied by expending more political capital in her behalf? 
</P>
<P>
When Bentley lost by a mere 1,300 votes out of 121,000 cast, it left 
Republicans wondering if a last-minute infusion of money, troops and luminaries 
could have tilted the election in her favor. 
</P>
<P>
Now it turns out there was a problem with the poll that had convinced the party 
that Bentley was a big loser and not worth the extra effort. The voters being 
called were Democrats, not Republicans. Operatives are trying to figure out how 
such a snafu happened.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN DIES OF FUMES FROM INDOOR BARBECUE GRILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 24-year-old man died of apparent carbon monoxide poisoning after inhaling 
fumes from a barbecue brought inside a Van Nuys apartment after a birthday 
dinner, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was identified as Hugo Fontela of Los Angeles, said Bob Dambacher, 
spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office. He was found dead about 
7 p.m. Sunday in a bedroom of the apartment in the 14000 block of Delano 
Street, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Alfonso Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Fontela had been celebrating the birthday of a friend, Teodorico Torres, 28, 
the night before with a barbecue chicken dinner on the patio of Torres' 
apartment, Rodriguez said. Torres and his roommate, Guadalupe Rodriguez, 28, 
brought the barbecue inside about 11 p.m. and left it in the kitchen, Sgt. 
Rodriguez said. Torres told police that he checked and thought the coals were 
extinguished when the three men went to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
When Rodriguez and Torres awoke Sunday evening, they found Fontela dead, police 
said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ARGENTINE ARRAIGNED IN MONEY LAUNDERING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Argentine gold trader suspected of laundering $500 million in cocaine 
proceeds for a Columbian drug cartel has pleaded not guilty to charges that he 
funneled the drug profits through Los Angeles jewelry wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Silvio Vivas, 39, was arraigned in U.S. District Court Monday on 
conspiracy and drug charges contained in separate indictments alleging that he 
and 32 other individuals and a Miami corporation ran an operation described as 
the largest of its kind ever uncovered by U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge William D. Keller ordered Vivas held without bail. Vivas 
was extradited from a Uruguay jail Friday and flown to Los Angeles. He had been 
in custody since Feb. 22 when, at the request of the FBI, he was arrested by 
the Uruguay National Police.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN FOR YEAR-ROUND SCHOOL IS DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bowing to pressure from angry parents, the Newhall School Board voted this week 
to delay for at least two years the start of year-round schooling at one 
elementary school in the fast-growing district. 
</P>
<P>
The trustees originally voted May 8 to start year-round schooling at Meadows 
Elementary School in Valencia in June, 1990. At the time, district officials 
said other schools would be switched to a year-round schedule as necessary to 
accommodate growing enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
But this week the trustees voted 3 to 2 to delay the change at least until 
July, 1992, to study other ways to cope with added enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 parents attended this week's meeting. Several speakers said 
year-round schedules would disrupt children's friendships and make family 
vacations impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Under year-round scheduling, traditional summer vacations are eliminated and 
vacation periods occur throughout the year. Students often are divided into 
three or four "tracks" that attend class on a rotating basis, with one group on 
vacation while the others are in school.

HUNTER TO REMAIN IN JAIL; NEW TRIAL IS ORDERED; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: A FEDERAL JUDGE HAS MOVED UP SENTENCING TO FEBRUARY. UNTIL THEN, THE 
FORMER DEL MAR MAYOR, CONSIDERED A FLIGHT RISK, WILL REMAIN BEHIND BARS. 
</P>

<P>
Nancy Hoover Hunter, sent to jail without bail after being convicted of four 
counts of tax evasion, will remain in custody pending her formal sentencing 
next year, a San Diego federal judge ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam, who presided over Hunter's eight-month 
trial on 197 counts of federal tax evasion and fraud, affirmed his order 
directing her to await sentencing in jail, reiterating that he is concerned 
Hunter might flee. 
</P>
<P>
However, the judge moved the date of Hunter's sentencing up two months, to Feb. 
20 instead of next April. He also ordered that Hunter face a new trial 
beginning that same day on the 192 counts that are central to the case against 
her but that stymied jurors despite 15 days of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears (Hunter) lived in a tinsel world, a make-believe world, for a 
number of years," Gilliam said. "Slowly, that world is being taken apart." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, 51, a former Del Mar mayor, wore a stained jail-issue khaki jumpsuit 
and frequently dabbed at her tears with tissues while she took notes at the 
90-minute hearing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter faces as much as 20 years in prison, or five years on each of the four 
counts of tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
The case against Hunter stemmed from her role as a top executive in the La 
Jolla investment firm J. David &amp; Co. from 1979 to 1984, when its checks 
began to bounce and nervous investors forced the firm into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
In all, investors lost about $80 million in the J. David affair, a giant Ponzi 
scheme in which prosecutors alleged that Hunter played an active role. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found Hunter guilty of tax evasion in connection with her personal tax 
returns for the years 1980 through 1983. It acquitted her of aiding and 
abetting in the filing of a false J. David partnership return in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The 192 other counts, primarily conspiracy and fraud, involved Hunter's 
purported involvement with the Ponzi scheme. Prosecutors charged that Hunter 
created false documents both to lure investors to J. David and then to lull 
them into staying put while the firm headed toward bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Those 192 were the counts on which the jury deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Monday's jury verdict, Gilliam sent Hunter, who had been free 
on $100,000 bail, to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center to await 
sentencing, which he originally set for April 16. In making that decision, he 
said he thought she was a flight risk, citing evidence in the case of her 
ability to travel around the world and to "live comfortably." 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's session, defense lawyer Robert Brewer tried to negotiate an 
arrangement under which Hunter could be released. 
</P>
<P>
The judge could raise Hunter's bail, require her to wear an electronic 
monitoring device or make her check in twice a day with the court, Brewer 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, Brewer said, had shown up for every court appearance since she was 
indicted in November, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant U.S. Atty. S. Gay Hugo, the lead prosecutor in the case, reminded 
Gilliam, as she had Monday, that Hunter's family has considerable wealth. 
Producing a list of the family's property holdings, she said that Kenneth 
Hunter owns 26 properties worth millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-year prison term would keep Hunter in jail for most of the rest of her 
life, Hugo said. And, because "money was no object" to Hunter or her family, 
she could easily flee to another country without giving up her family or her 
life style, Hugo said. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam, as he had Monday, sided with Hugo, saying Hunter had not shown in a 
"clear and convincing" way, as the law requires, that she would not flee. He 
ordered her returned to the Metropolitan Correctional Center but, because of 
that decision to keep her in jail, moved up the sentencing hearing, to Feb. 20 
from April 16. 
</P>
<P>
Brewer said he planned an immediate appeal of the judge's decision to the 9th 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

PLANNERS HEED PICUS, REJECT WARNER RIDGE 
</P>

<P>
A City Council committee voted Tuesday to recommend that a controversial Warner 
Ridge office project be rejected and the land rezoned for houses. 
</P>
<P>
The council's Planning and Land Use Management Committee voted 2 to 1 against 
the $150-million project in light of a recommendation against it by City 
Councilwoman Joy Picus, and a public hearing Tuesday at which some Woodland 
Hills residents sharply criticized it. 
</P>
<P>
The issue next goes to the full council, which is expected to consider it next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Normally the council heeds the wishes of the council member in whose district a 
development is proposed. 
</P>
<P>
Picus, whose district includes Warner Ridge at the northeast corner of De Soto 
Avenue and Oxnard Street, said developer Jack Spound's project was 
ill-conceived and would be out of scale with the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
She argued that De Soto should be maintained as the boundary between Warner 
Center's commercial development on the west side and residences to the east. 
</P>
<P>
In voting to reject the project, Councilmen Michael Woo and Hal Bernson said 
they were influenced by Picus' position, especially regarding allowing 
commercial development east of De Soto. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert Farrell, the lone dissenter, said he was persuaded to vote 
for Spound's project by the fact that it had been approved by both a city 
hearing examiner and the city Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners had praised the nine-building, 810,000-square-foot project as a 
"quality development" that would have generous amounts of open space and 
measures to reduce traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
An angry Spound said that the council, if it rejects the development, will be 
sending the "dangerous message" that a project can be turned down "on the whim 
of a single council member whose motives are purely political." 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, five residents of a condominium complex east of De Soto 
supported the office project. 
</P>
<P>
They endorsed Spound's proposal because it would create a landscaping buffer 
near their condominiums. They said they preferred the offices to the 100 or 
more houses that would be allowed under Picus' rezoning proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But more than a dozen opponents, including leaders of the Woodland Hills 
Homeowners Organization, said the project would intensify what one member 
called a "quagmire of traffic" in and around Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Murley, representing the Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assns., 
sarcastically suggested that Spound be required to "double- or triple-deck" 
nearby streets to offset the traffic his development would generate.

PANEL OKS $2 BILLION PROJECT FOR CHATSWORTH; 
</P>
<P>
PORTER RANCH: THE PLAN SENT TO THE CITY COUNCIL CONTAINS SOME BUT NOT ALL THE 
CONCESSIONS SOUGHT BY MAYOR BRADLEY. 
</P>

<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson steered a $2-billion development 
proposal for the Porter Ranch area through a key council committee Tuesday 
after conceding some -- but not all -- of the changes Mayor Tom Bradley said 
were needed to avoid the mayor's veto. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning and Land Use Committee voted 2 to 1 to send the proposal -- which 
would be the largest single project in the city's history -- to the full 
council after Bernson inserted changes providing for some "low- or 
moderate-income" housing in the development. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he would not go along with two other major recommendations by 
Bradley, reducing office parking and integrating neighborhood stores into 
residential areas instead of segregating them in a commercial area. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said his changes to the 1,300-acre proposal for the hills north of the 
Simi Valley Freeway in Chatsworth "address the questions that were raised by 
the mayor . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But it was unknown whether the slightly modified project would satisfy the 
mayor. Bradley aide Jane Blumenfeld said she could not comment without more 
time to review Bernson's changes. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said he expects the development could be considered in January by the 
full council, where it will require 10 votes for passage because of the mayor's 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Friday, Bradley outlined 10 recommendations that included 
allocating 20% of the project's housing to low- or moderate-income families, 
spreading out the project's neighborhood-oriented retail stores into its 
residential area and cutting its office parking in half to encourage 
ride-sharing and use of public transit. He wanted environmental measures such 
as tree planting, recycling, composting and use of reclaimed water. Bradley 
also urged some form of transit system within the project and asked for two 
school sites to be set aside instead of one. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said Tuesday that "some of his suggestions have merit and should be 
incorporated, while others are already included . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal by Beverly Hills developer Nathan Shapell is for 2,195 
single-family houses, 1,200 townhouses and a commercial complex of nearly 6 
million square feet, including 10-story office buildings and a regional mall 
the size of the Northridge Fashion Center. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson proposed Tuesday that 20% of the housing in the townhouse area of the 
project -- and not the single-family estate area -- "be made available to 
persons and families of low and/or moderate income." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said a transit system was already conceptually included in the 
proposal, but he inserted a requirement that plans for a privately funded 
transportation system be submitted to city officials before much of the 
commercial development could be built. 
</P>
<P>
But Bernson would not reduce office parking, saying Porter Ranch would not be a 
"highly urbanized" area with access to mass transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said he would not put small commercial centers into the residential 
areas, saying that would create undesireable "mini-malls." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson included some provisions for use of reclaimed water and tree planting. 
But he said the project should not be singled out for environmental programs 
that would eventually be imposed citywide. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson agreed to require the Porter Ranch developer to set aside a junior high 
school in addition to the elementary site already in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson and Councilman Michael Woo voted for the proposal. Councilman Robert 
Farrell voted against it.

DEVELOPER NOMINATED FOR PARK BOARD; 
</P>
<P>
MOUNTAINS: CRITICS SAY PETER KYROS HAS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST BECAUSE HIS FIRM 
IS NEGOTIATING A LAND SWAP WITH THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Developer Peter Kyros, whose company's plans to build in the Santa Monica 
Mountains involve a crucial land swap with the National Park Service, is under 
consideration as a board member of a Park Service fund-raising auxiliary, 
officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Kyros has not been formally nominated to the board of the Santa Monica 
Mountains Parklands Assn., but his name has been suggested by David Gackenbach, 
superintendent of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and he 
attended the board's monthly meeting last Wednesday as an observer. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-member board is expected to make formal nominations before voting to 
replace two resigning members at a meeting Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the idea say Kyros, a general partner of Potomac Investment 
Associates, could be an ideal resource to the association, with the money and 
connections to help the foundering group meet its goals of acquiring and 
preserving parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Dennis Washburn said he favored Kyros' joining the board because 
he believed "the more cooperation with developers, the better." 
</P>
<P>
But critics say Kyros' membership on the board would present a conflict of 
interest because his plans for developing Jordan Ranch in eastern Ventura 
County require Park Service approval. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks to me to be more than a little collusive," said Jill Swift, outgoing 
association president. "This is just an example of what goes on behind the 
scenes." 
</P>
<P>
Margot Feuer, who was a member of the former advisory commission to the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, said, "I am really quite distressed 
about what I see as a major conflict of interest. The park service is dealing 
with this man on an exchange." 
</P>
<P>
Potomac Investment Associates of Maryland holds the option to buy Jordan Ranch, 
a 2,308-acre parcel of oak-dotted meadows and panoramic views just west of the 
Los Angeles County line. The property is owned by entertainer Bob Hope, who 
over the years has rejected proposals that he donate or sell all or part of the 
land to the Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
Potomac Investment wants to build 1,152 homes and a PGA Tournament golf course 
on the site, and crucial to those plans is a four-lane access road that would 
connect the development to the Ventura Freeway by cutting through Cheeseboro 
Canyon Park. 
</P>
<P>
The developer has proposed that the National Park Service swap 60 acres of 
parkland for the road in return for about 800 acres of Jordan Ranch, much of it 
in the upland meadow known as China Flat. 
</P>
<P>
Gackenbach's office is expected to make its recommendation on the trade to the 
Park Service's headquarters in Washington, sometime next fall or winter, after 
environmental impact reports have been completed and reviewed and the Ventura 
County Board of Supervisors votes on the project. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Gackenbach acknowledged that he proposed Kyros and 
several other developers as potential members of the association's board, 
mainly because the group has been unsuccessful in raising funds and could use 
patrons with clout. 
</P>
<P>
He said he made the suggestions at an October board meeting during a discussion 
of recruiting new members. He suggested that involvement with the parklands 
association could make developers "more attuned to what we're doing and what 
we're trying to accomplish," and help the national recreation area at a time 
when little federal money is available for acquiring and preserving parklands. 
</P>
<P>
But Gackenbach said that if Kyros' place on the board would generate 
controversy, he would not push it. 
</P>
<P>
Kyros said he would like to serve on the board if chosen, but that "the last 
thing I want to do is be in conflict or cause some internal controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"I really do believe the time has come for the private sector members who are 
the park's neighbors to come together and offer support for the park," Kyros 
said. "I feel I can help the park whether I am on the board or not." 
</P>
<P>
Kyros and Gackenbach said Kyros' presence on the board would present no 
conflict because the group's sole purpose is to raise funds for the mountain 
recreation area and has no authority over Park Service policies or decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Swift and other critics, however, noted that the parks superintendent attends 
most meetings, and that the association operates out of the national recreation 
area's headquarters in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Parklands Assn. was formed about three years ago, 
largely as a replacement for the dismantled Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area Advisory Commission.

CALABASAS ASKS COUNTY TO OK 2ND PROPOSAL FOR CITYHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Backers of cityhood for Calabasas, encouraged by what they believe will be a 
rosier revenue picture for their second incorporation bid, on Tuesday asked a 
county agency to consider their proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The Calabasas Cityhood Committee's earlier incorporation effort was rejected in 
February, 1988, by the Local Agency Formation Commission, because the 
commission's staff estimated that the proposed city would be $450,000 in debt 
after its first year in operation. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood committee vice president Doris LaViolette said Tuesday that the new 
bid for cityhood adds sales tax-generating commercial areas along Agoura Road, 
which were not included in the earlier proposal, and two car dealerships have 
been built along the Ventura Freeway. She said the population and property 
values in the area also have grown since the earlier incorporation effort. 
</P>
<P>
"The revenue picture is better this time around," said LaViolette, who 
presented documents required to initiate the incorporation process to LAFCO, 
which will rule on the matter. She said the committee is hoping the commission 
will approve the proposal in time to place it on the November, 1990, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO executive officer Ruth Benell said the commission staff will research the 
anticipated revenue of the proposal and balance them against the cost of 
replacing services now provided by the state and county. The commission will 
then hold public hearings to consider the issue. If LAFCO endorses the 
proposal, it then would have to win voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
LaViolette said the proposed 14-square-mile city would be bordered on the east 
by the city of Los Angeles; on the west by the city of Agoura; on the north by 
the Ventura County line; and on the south by the Malibu Creek State Park. 
</P>
<P>
The boundaries would also include a 550-house residential tract, proposed by 
the Irvine-based development company owned by Jim Baldwin. The cityhood 
committee reached a compromise with Baldwin, which called for him to reduce the 
number of houses he wanted to build by about two-thirds in exchange for the 
committee's backing of his project. Baldwin also agreed to lobby LAFCO in favor 
of cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
LaViolette said the proposed city would have about 8,500 registered voters and 
about 26,000 residents.

BUILDER FINED $47,000 FOR HIDING CAMPAIGN FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fair Political Practices Commission on Tuesday imposed a record fine of 
$47,000 against Griffin Homes for making campaign contributions through its 
employees and failing to disclose itself as the source of the money. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty, approved by a 4-0 vote, represents the largest fine by the 
commission in its 14-year history for violations involving hiding or 
"laundering" campaign contributions, spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. 
</P>
<P>
One of Southern California's largest developers, Griffin Homes had originally 
agreed to pay $26,500 in a proposed settlement of its case with the 
commission's staff. 
</P>
<P>
Its violations, according to the commission, included 22 laundered campaign 
contributions totaling $3,280, which were made between 1985 and 1988 to 
candidates including Moorpark Councilman Bernardo Perez and Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
But at its meeting last month, the commission rejected that fine as too low and 
characterized the builder's violations as "very serious." Commission chairman 
John Larson later said, "I'm sick and tired of the developers buying city 
councils. We've got to make a stand." 
</P>
<P>
The higher fine was adopted Tuesday without comment, Michioku said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Griffin Homes, sales and marketing vice president Marion 
Kiesling, said in a prepared statement that the company had "worked diligently 
and expeditiously with the state Fair Political Practices Commission to get 
this matter behind us." 
</P>
<P>
"While the amount of the contributions was small, only $3,280, we recognize the 
importance of upholding the regulations of the Fair Political Practices 
Commission and agree to pay the fine levied against Griffin Homes." 
</P>
<P>
The commission released its findings against the Calabasas builder in a report 
issued Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the recipients of the contributions generally did not 
know that Griffin Homes had supplied the money. An exception was Antonovich, 
who last year accepted $300 from a man he later learned was a Griffin employee, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's investigation found that Perez received five contributions of 
$99 each during an unsuccessful bid for the Moorpark City Council in 1987. At 
the time, the report noted, Griffin Homes was seeking permits from the Moorpark 
City Council to build 494 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Perez has denied knowing the source of the money.

YOUTH FITNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest your article "State Students Make Weak Showing in First 
Fitness Test" (Part A, Nov. 15) concerning the physical performance of 
California schoolchildren. The Department of Education is to be commended for 
providing a preview of what may be a very alarming picture of our children's 
comprehensive physical health status. 
</P>
<P>
The department's tests are instructive on physical performance of our 
schoolchildren, but a more complete evaluation of health and fitness must be 
undertaken. Recent studies in selected school districts show that risk factors 
such as obesity, poor nutrition and smoking are more evident in today's 
children. Since these factors are higher today, our children have a greater 
chance of early cardiovascular disease. 
</P>
<P>
Your readers may be interested in knowing about my legislation, AB 293, which 
establishes state guidelines on physical health and fitness. These guidelines 
will be developed through a comprehensive, physical health assessment program 
conducted by the California State University and the University of California 
medical schools. Upon completion, the guidelines will be distributed to the 
Department of Education for curriculum development and teacher training. The 
state guidelines will show our commitment to the growth of our children's minds 
as well as the health of their bodies.

WATER CONTRACTS FOR FARMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' editorial "Not Exactly a Watertight Deal" (Dec. 1) suggests that the 
federal government provide water to California farmers under "temporary 
contracts" while environmental impact studies are pending, studies which, by 
your own estimate, could take three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
To understand the reality of such a suggestion, next time you apply for a 
mortgage to buy a home, try telling the lender that you are "temporarily 
employed." Then, tell the lender that there is a study under way which may 
adversely impact your employment. Just for good measure, tell the lender that 
there is likely to be litigation over that study. That is the very situation 
farmers and local communities would find themselves with temporary water 
service contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Department of the Interior officials renewed the water contracts of 28 
irrigation districts because they are obligated to do so under law. The 
department is absolutely correct in stating that, if environmental impact 
studies indicate that policies should be altered, those alterations can be 
implemented when the studies are complete. 
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that in an earlier editorial The Times reminded us that the 
President's Council on Environmental Quality had recommended an EIS be done 
before contracts are renewed. It is interesting that the chairman of the 
council is now calling Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan's decision "a sensible 
balancing between environmental concerns and the need to provide water." 
</P>
<P>
If The Times truly wants to see environmental restoration, it should recognize 
Lujan's call for an initiative to restore the San Joaquin River as a move in 
the right direction, because it signals a willingness to enhance the valley's 
environment without punishing farmers and valley communities.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN GUILTY OF MURDER IN BURGLARY RETALIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Long Beach man was convicted Tuesday of murdering a Van Nuys man and trying 
to kill the man's girlfriend in retaliation for a burglary. 
</P>
<P>
A Van Nuys Superior Court jury deliberated one day before finding Dean Kennedy, 
30, guilty of all charges against him. The charges, first-degree murder for 
financial gain and attempted murder, carry a maximum sentence of life in prison 
without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Judith Meisels Ashmann scheduled sentencing for 
Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Phillip H. Rabichow said Kennedy hired two men to kill 
Thomas Wilson, 35, and Susan Yee, 32, both of Van Nuys, on Dec. 23, 1987. 
Wilson was shot twice in the head and once in the stomach. Wilson died; Yee was 
shot but recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, the owner of a window tinting business, was involved in illegal 
activities with Wilson involving credit cards, Rabichow said. Wilson 
burglarized Kennedy's home of a $35,000 check and some credit cards, 
prosecutors said. An angered Kennedy hired John Young, 28, of Long Beach and 
Kitiona Paepule, 22, of Paramount to kill Wilson and provided a gun and 
silencer, Rabichow said. 
</P>
<P>
Young, who pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to life in prison 
without possibility of parole, testified against Kennedy. Paepule's trial is 
pending.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTELOPE VALLEY SCHOOL DRIVERS VOTE TO STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Employees of the school bus agency that serves eight Antelope Valley school 
districts voted Tuesday to authorize a strike, complaining about stalled 
negotiations and proposed reductions in benefits. 
</P>
<P>
School bus drivers, mechanics and office workers at the Antelope Valley Schools 
Transportation Agency, which carries about 17,000 students daily, voted 90 to 
17 in favor of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
They set no specific strike deadline, said Sharon Cottee, president of the 
employees' union. 
</P>
<P>
Agency workers are angry about proposals that would give management the ability 
to unilaterally change drivers' work hours, delete guaranteed two-hour minimum 
pay when they are called to work and substantially cut sick-time benefits, said 
Cottee, a driver for five years. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to take some things away from us that we've had since the 
beginning," said Cottee, president of Chapter 652 of the California School 
Employees Assn. The union group has represented agency employees since it was 
formed in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The agency is operated by the Antelope Valley Union High School District and 
seven elementary districts: Palmdale, Lancaster, Westside Union, Keppel Union, 
Wilsona, Hughes-Elizabeth Lakes Union and Gorman. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's three-year contract with its employees expired at the end of June. 
The union was asking for a 10% pay raise, and the agency had offered only 5.5%, 
but Cottee said pay was not a major issue of the dispute.

A MENU FOR DEFENSE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America's defense budget is likely to shrink by $50 billion to $100 billion 
over the next 10 years, and could fall even further without hobbling the 
Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Some military analysts think the budget will be cut to measure, reflecting 
strategic decisions about possible threats to national security of the next 
generation that will be different from those of the Cold War, and will require 
different forces to fend them off. More analysts expect budget cuts to move 
along paths of least resistance, preserving expensive technologies designed for 
the next generation of superpower confrontation. The armed forces and Congress 
usually make common cause in shielding high-technology systems and the jobs 
they support. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the pattern of cuts, they probably will start at least by holding the 
Pentagon budget level at about $300 billion for a number of years and force the 
Pentagon to swallow annual inflation. This is about what President Bush is 
proposing for the next fiscal year, ending in October, 1991, and would mean 
annual reductions of between $10 billion and $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Reductions also will be real and not illusory, making them quite different from 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's much-discussed and misunderstood cut of $180 
billion. Cheney's dollar numbers represent the amount that it would take to buy 
everything in the Pentagon's last five-year plan, a plan that no longer applies 
to a world in which communism has collapsed in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
All proposals for defense-budget cuts start with the assumption that the 
Pentagon could carry out its missions without loss of needed firepower at lower 
budget figures. A survey of analysts led Fortune magazine to conclude last July 
that the Pentagon could be ready to meet any likely threat 10 years from now 
with a budget one-third smaller than the present level of $300 billion a year. 
A study for the Brookings Institution in Washington last month concluded that 
the Pentagon could get by on even less by then, about $160 billion. Most of 
these analyses assume a swing in emphasis from a mission of slugging it out in 
a ground and nuclear war over Europe to smaller regional conflicts in which 
Americans would be forced to intervene to defend allies. 
</P>
<P>
The figures did not fall out of some ivory tower. What distinguishes them from 
Pentagon estimates is that they are antiseptic proposals, untainted by 
interservice rivalries and the real world of defense logrolling between the 
White House and Congress. For precisely that reason the Brookings analysis, for 
instance, is being taken quite seriously in Washington circles. These 
alternative defense budgets cannot and should not be dismissed from the defense 
budget debate just because they float into the exercise from the outside. The 
Brookings study was done by William W. Kaufman, who started analyzing strategy 
and forces for the nuclear era at the RAND Corp. in 1950, served with six 
secretaries of defense and began writing alternative defense budgets after he 
left the Pentagon. He knows his field in such detail that he can brief at any 
length on how his version of U.S. forces would perform using only notes on a 
single 3x5 card. He was one of the analysts that Fortune surveyed. So was 
Lawrence Korb, a sub-cabinet officer in Ronald Reagan's Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Fortune's survey would reduce the defense budget to about $200 billion, taking 
the biggest single chunk from the Army to reflect the diminished threat of a 
major war in Europe. Reports that the Army's plans to turn itself into a global 
flying squad to put down regional conflicts are drawing Marine Corps opposition 
(on the ground that it already has that mission) is just a hint of the domestic 
battles that defense cuts will bring. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear forces would be negotiated down from 13,000 to 4,000 weapons for an 
annual savings of $15 billion. Kaufman's analysis calls for the same number of 
nuclear weapons on the premise that there are only 2,000 targets worth hitting 
in the Soviet Union and that two weapons for each is enough. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman's lower budget would also include conventional arms reductions in 
addition to cuts in expensive weapons programs. He would cancel the Navy's 
Trident II submarine, the C-17 combat cargo plane, the single-warhead Midgetman 
missile and plans to put 10-warhead MX missiles on railroad flatcars to make 
them mobile. 
</P>
<P>
Gross budget figures do not help defense industries or defense workers much 
when they are trying to figure out how peace in Europe will affect them 
personally. That requires detailed information on what kinds of troops and what 
kinds of weapons systems will be cut, the kind of information the Pentagfon 
still has not produced. But gross figures can be useful in trying to analyze 
the overall effect on a region with as big a share of the defense contracting 
budget as Southern California.

COLD PROMPTS OPENING OF SYLMAR SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Temperatures that dipped near freezing this week prompted the opening of the 
San Fernando Valley's first city-operated temporary shelter for homeless 
families with children, but few families have used it so far, shelter 
organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter, set up Sunday night at the Army National Guard Armory in Sylmar, 
is able to house 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
But none showed up Sunday, and only two spent Monday night there, said Nancy 
Bianconi, director of housing operations for L.A. Family Housing, which is 
under contract with the city to run the shelter and other homeless facilities 
during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Shelter operators said that as of 8 p.m. Tuesday, three families had decided to 
spend the night in the armory. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in the Valley were expected to dip to the 30s and low 40s Tuesday 
night and tonight, the National Weather Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
The shelter was opened to comply with a new city policy under which most 
homeless families in the Valley and Westside are accommodated in shelters on 
cold nights instead of receiving vouchers to stay in motels. 
</P>
<P>
The voucher system was too costly and denied homeless families many of the free 
services that are available in shelters, Bianconi said. Homeless single adults 
and couples are not affected by the new policy and may continue to seek shelter 
in armories and other facilities as they have in the past, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At a Van Nuys armory that accommodated an average of 115 homeless single adults 
and couples on cold nights last winter, only 10 people showed up Sunday night 
and there were about 25 boarders Tuesday night, Bianconi said. 
</P>
<P>
An organizer at the Van Nuys armory said word that the shelter was open 
appeared to be spreading, as more than 40 people showed up by about 7:30 p.m. 
Tuesday. They were sleeping on cots in the gymnasium and would receive a hot 
dinner and breakfast, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bianconi said one reason for the lower numbers was the National Guard's policy 
of requiring advance approval for television news to visit the shelters. The 
policy, which she said was enacted this year, has stifled media coverage of the 
shelter program and resulted in reduced awareness of the shelters among 
homeless, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the National Guard could not be reached for comment Tuesday 
evening.

SKID ROW: NOT NEW, AND IT WON'T GO AWAY; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESSNESS: IT'S NOT JUST AN ALCOHOL OR MENTAL-ILLNESS PROBLEM; SOME STREET 
PEOPLE CAN'T RETURN TO THE WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLANCY IMISLUND, Clancy Imislund is managing director of the Midnight 
Mission in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Skid Row has always been an inner-city version of a desert island, the home of 
the ultimate dropout from a world whose demands have become emotionally 
overpowering. For some of its inhabitants, the ability to cope was lost along 
the way, and some never were able to live in the structure called society. 
</P>
<P>
Society is confronted here with men and women whose surface problems appear to 
be homelessness or alcohol or drugs or mental disarray, but whose basic 
emotional discord goes much deeper. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the current political rhetoric, it's not a new condition, nor is it a 
result of different government administrations or economic swings. Skid Rows 
are present in one form or another in every major urban area in the world, and 
have existed for many generations. For example, the three largest Skid Row 
facilities in Los Angeles were started well before World War I. 
</P>
<P>
Endless studies, dozens of major social experiments, hundreds of agencies and 
the expenditure of many millions of dollars have had no significant effect in 
ending this most perplexing example of homelessness. In fact, the situation is 
arguably worse today than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
To compound the problem, most of the men and women living in these dreadful 
conditions seem to be extremely reluctant to participate in any form of 
rehabilitation or recovery that requires a major effort on their own part. In a 
sense, this is the paradox of Skid Row: People who have lost the emotional 
ability to help themselves can only be helped if they try to help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The net result has been intermittent periods of frustrated aid and benign 
neglect from government, with the day-to-day care efforts coming primarily from 
local missions and social agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly enough, there have been some positive results in cases where a 
controlled situation can be enforced. At the Midnight Mission, for example, 
every employee on our staff has come to us from Skid Row at one time or 
another, and many are today working at levels that would have once been 
impossible for them. A strict work-ethic atmosphere enables these people to 
regain the self-worth to live in a stressful world. 
</P>
<P>
It's a long procedure for some and many fall back into their old lives, but we 
know that it is successful. Not only because of the 70 clean, clear-eyed people 
on our payroll, but also because of a significant group of "alumni" who have 
made the transition to living in the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
As an indication of the success of this work ethic, the state for several years 
has operated a regular employment office in the Midnight Mission, the only 
installation of its type in the entire state system. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, we serve almost 1,700 meals a day, and most go to people who 
will live and die on Skid Row without ever being able to break the 
psychological barrier that exists at the edge of this dreary area. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously there are no simple answers, or they would have been found long ago 
by dedicated people, but there are a few things that are essential if we're 
going to begin any meaningful change in this community of human desperation. 
</P>
<P>
These include halfway houses with adequate counseling and guidance facilities 
for Skid Row's mentally ill, and more effective drug enforcement by local and 
federal agencies, since crack cocaine is almost easier to obtain here than 
cigarettes. We also need live-in drug rehabilitation facilities for addicts, 
without the current 6- to 18-month waiting period, by which time the addict is 
in prison or dead. We need more facilities for women and anything that will 
also help street children, who are currently all but unserved. There is a 
dearth of help for the Spanish-speaking homeless immigrants now flooding our 
back streets and alleys. 
</P>
<P>
These are some of the more obvious needs. There are others that are less 
visible. We must reevaluate the Welfare and General Relief system on Skid Row. 
An amazing number of young and healthy people support their drug habits with 
welfare while they live on the streets and prey on others, and we must provide 
an escape hatch for the long-term alcoholics who live and die on these streets, 
perhaps in the form of a facility such as the county's old farm at Saugus, 
where "hopeless" street drunks could be sent for up to 180 days of fresh air, 
sunshine, good food, simple jobs, cleanliness and the assistance of Alcoholics 
Anonymous. When this program closed some years ago, the best chance to legally 
move a street drunk out of Skid Row for a chance for physical and mental 
recovery disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Such programs would be only a beginning. But that's where all journeys start.

CATHOLIC COMMENT ON ISSUES ISN'T MEANT TO BE POPULAR; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: AMERICANS CHEER WHEN THE CHURCH CALLS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND HISS WHEN 
IT PREACHES ON SEX. BUT IT'S ALL PART OF THE SAME FABRIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARTHUR A. LORD, Arthur A. Lord, a producer for NBC News in Burbank, has 
covered Pope John Paul II's visits to foreign countries since 1979. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many Americans, including me, get an uneasy feeling when religious leaders 
involve themselves in political issues. The most recent and obvious examples 
are the denial of Communion to candidate (now state Sen.-elect) Lucy Killea by 
San Diego's Roman Catholic Bishop Leo T. Maher because of her pro-choice stand 
on abortion; and Los Angeles Archbishop Roger M. Mahony's statement advising 
gay men not to use condoms to prevent AIDS, but rather to abstain from sexual 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, the advice from the pulpit did not have the desired effect. 
Killea, considered a long shot before Bishop Maher's edict, catapulted into the 
national spotlight and won the election. Mahony's statement, which flew in the 
face of worldwide health programs encouraging the use of condoms, drew 
widespread criticism and anger. 
</P>
<P>
There may be a tendency to compare these episodes with some country preacher 
railing against strong drink or Jerry Falwell telling his flock to vote only 
for candidates who support Christian principles, but that is not the case here. 
Falwell and the country preacher are individuals, shooting from the hip. Maher 
and Mahony are following a carefully thought-out theological position that 
comes from the Vatican and is continually taught by the Pope. 
</P>
<P>
When Pope John Paul II visited Mexico in January, 1979, it was the beginning of 
a pastoral, diplomatic and political initiative that was without precedent in 
the history of the Catholic Church. Since that first trip abroad, the Pope has 
covered more than 80 countries, including two visits to the United States, 
drawing huge crowds, intensive media coverage and warm television pictures that 
are transmitted worldwide. But the Pope is not running for office. He has a 
mission and a message for the faithful and the clergy. 
</P>
<P>
His first visit to Poland, in 1979, demonstrated that the Communist government 
in Warsaw could not crush the religious fervor of the Polish people. On his 
second visit, he held a surprise meeting with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and 
convinced the authorities to lift martial law. That act was a strong link in 
the chain of events that eventually led to the election of a democratic 
government in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983 he visited Nicaragua and raised hell with several priests who had taken 
posts in the Sandinista government. In El Salvador, he condemned the right-wing 
death squads. In Haiti, he publicly admonished Jean-Claude Duvalier for his 
exploitation of that poor country. And upon his departure he instructed lay 
people and clergy to carry on his message. 
</P>
<P>
The issues addressed by the Pope vary with the geography. In Africa, for 
example, it's monogamy -- should a man be allowed to have more than one wife? 
The Pope says no. In Central America, it's human rights. In North America, for 
some strange reason, it's all sex-oriented -- birth control, abortion, sex 
before marriage, divorce and celibacy in the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
Most Americans would probably applaud what the Pope did in Poland, Nicaragua 
and Haiti. They would also approve the actions of Cardinal Jaime Sin, the 
archbishop of Manila, who was instrumental in the overthrow of Ferdinand 
Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
It is somewhat hypocritical, then, for Americans to feel that it is commendable 
for the Catholic hierarchy to try to effect social change in all those other 
places, but it is taboo for them to do it here. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican's activism is understandable. The Pope, as a young man growing up 
in Poland, was acutely aware that during World War II, Pope Pius XII did 
virtually nothing to prevent the Nazi slaughter of Jews, Slavs, Poles and other 
"undesirables." 
</P>
<P>
Catholic priests around the world have a clear mandate to speak out on issues 
the church deems important. Public censure, as in the Lucy Killea affair, will 
not deter this activity. 
</P>
<P>
Church doctrine on such volatile issues as abortion, birth control and sexual 
habits may be unpopular to many Americans, including American Catholics, but it 
is clearly correct in the minds of those who are committed either by their 
faith or their position to spread these teachings.

BOLD POLICY IS MADE, AND INVESTORS YAWN; 
</P>
<P>
ARGENTINA: PRESIDENT CARLOS SAUL MENEM HATCHED AN AMBITIOUS ECONOMIC PROGRAM 
WHEN HE WON OFFICE. LACK OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT MAY RUIN IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JORGE CASTANEDA, Jorge G. Castaneda is a graduate professor of political 
science at the National University of Mexico in Mexico City. He is in South 
America as part of a lengthy regional study.

<TEXT>
<P>
After barely five months as president, Carlos Saul Menem has run into 
Argentina's traditional unmovable obstacle: the sheer intractability of the 
nation's problems. Menem's ambitious economic program, highly touted abroad but 
deeply controversial in Argentina, is in trouble. Worse still, political 
signals from the Argentine electorate are far from comforting. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as he moved into the presidential palace, Menem broke with many canons 
of his Peronist legacy. He drew up an economic plan known here as the Plan BB, 
for Bunge y Born, the giant grain conglomerate from which his new economic team 
was drawn. The plan included opening the economy to imports and foreign 
investments, privatization of large chunks of the state-owned sector, cuts in 
consumer and industrial subsidies and stabilization of the exchange rate after 
an initial devaluation, together with moderate wage increases and substantial 
price hikes. The immediate aim was to control inflation, then running at a 
triple-digit rate. The long-term objective was to make the Argentine economy 
grow again, essentially by handing it over to the private sector, in consonance 
with similar strategies under way in Mexico and Chile. 
</P>
<P>
On paper, the Menem-Bunge y Born match seemed to be a winning combination. The 
new president had the electoral mandate and the political legitimacy stemming 
from his Peronist heritage. The grain firm has close ties with the rest of the 
Argentine business community and, equally important, with international 
financial circles. But like many other economic blueprints in Latin America 
today, this one rapidly encountered two underlying, virtually unmanageable 
problems. One comes from below, the other from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The attempt to dismantle a significant part of the Argentine welfare state -- 
which has survived several military dictatorships and a flurry of conservative 
policies in the late 1970's -- has produced tremors in the working class. 
Wildcat strikes by railroad workers and a split in the national labor union 
along pro- and anti-Menem lines are among the first warning signs of 
grass-roots discontent. The election of extreme right-wing Gen. Antonio Domingo 
Bussi as senator from Tucuman, a mid-sized city in the interior, rocked the 
Establishment that had hoped the Radical and Peronist parties could maintain 
their tidy two-party arrangement. More important, the election of a socialist 
mayor in Rosario, the nation's second-largest city, where food riots erupted in 
June, dealt a serious blow to Menem, who had carried that erstwhile Peronist 
bastion with a wide margin in the presidential vote. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond the limits that Argentina's electorate and unions can set on Menem's 
modernization drive, the main obstacle resembles the one confronting other, 
similar attempts in Latin America: The domestic private sector and the foreign 
business community simply do not seem interested. Last week the Argentine 
government was forced to decree new price increases (of more than 50%, for 
instance, for gasoline) and a 34% devaluation of the austral because of a new 
spurt of inflation in November and another run on the central bank's reserves. 
By early December, despite an adequate trade surplus and a virtual suspension 
of payment on its debt service, the government was losing $50 million a day. 
Instead of bringing money into the country -- the intent of the deal with Bunge 
y Born -- the Argentine private sector was still sending it out. One can 
privatize state-owned industries and sharply cut back the state's role in the 
economy only if there is somebody willing and able to buy what is being sold. 
</P>
<P>
Latin American private investors, with the possible exception of those in 
Brazil and Chile, are requiring political and economic conditions to bring back 
their flown capital that no government can realistically meet. So presidents 
and finance ministers plunge into economic feats of daring that must have 
massive private-sector funding, to succeed, only to find that the money stays 
in Miami, Los Angeles or New York. They then look to foreign creditors or 
investors, and discover that in the age of perestroika, Europe-'92 and the 
Pacific Rim, Latin America (including Mexico) is not the most exciting 
investment in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Menem's program of economic renewal has not yet foundered. Discontent from 
below and indifference abroad are both still manageable, and the jury is still 
out on the free-market economic policies that he and others are experimenting 
with. But the dangers posed by diminishing most Argentines' standard of living, 
at least in the short run, or, if the program fails outright, continued 
stagnation due to under-funding, are real.

Reaching Out: The Museum of Contemporary Art says it will use a new $250,000 
National Endowment for the Arts challenge grant to establish an outreach 
program to take contemporary art into the neighborhoods of Los Angeles. "We 
will work with artists and educators and community leaders . . . the program is 
a very major decision on MOCA's part to really involve itself with our 
neighbors," said Vas Prabhu, the downtown museum's director of education. Also 
receiving an NEA challenge grant is the Huntington Library, which was awarded 
$100,000 to establish a fund for art conservation projects. Both institutions 
must raise $3 in matching funds for every federal dollar given. DANIEL CERONE

A Clarification: Inquiries by the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center 
have apparently averted a threat that contents of the State Jewish Museum in 
Prague, Czechoslovakia, would be sold at auction in London by Christie's. The 
possibility of such a sale were first reported last month, prompting the

Motor City Blues: Film maker Michael Moore says pressure from General Motors 
caused the Detroit Institute of Arts to cancel the Jan. 11 premiere of his film 
"Roger and Me," a critically-hailed documentary that mocks GM Chairman Roger 
Smith. Moore said the cancellation was "an act of censorship," but the 
institute's director, Elliott Wilhelm, said the action was taken because Warner 
Bros. couldn't guarantee that Moore would attend the opening of the film, which 
shows how GM cutbacks have hurt Moore's hometown of Flint, Mich. Smith is on 
the board of trustees of the DIA Founders Society and he and his wife are major 
contributors. GM also makes cumulative contributions of $100,000 or more.

L.A. PHILHARMONIC CHAMBER SOCIETY AT GINDI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS

<TEXT>
<P>
The handsomely constructed program offered by the Los Angeles Philharmonic 
Chamber Music Society at Gindi Auditorium on Monday was an occasion for taking 
pleasure in the music itself, without the distracting presence of big-name 
performers and the high expectations -- and frequently, disappointments -- they 
engender. 
</P>
<P>
It was an evening to savor Poulenc, Faure and, to a lesser extent, Prokofiev. 
</P>
<P>
Oboist David Weiss, bassoonist David Breidenthal and pianist Alpha Hockett 
Walker set the tone by flicking out Poulenc's 1926 Trio in a neatly balanced 
reading, responsive to the composer's wit and unconcerned with whether his 
lyric statements are sentimental or parodies of sentimentality. A big tune is a 
big tune, and they projected the whopper in the middle movement with becoming 
breadth. 
</P>
<P>
Faure's C-minor Piano Quartet ended the evening on a different Gallic note, 
surging, sighing and singing rapturously in the hands of pianist Armen 
Guzelimian -- as stylish and forceful a chamber pianist as this part of the 
world offers -- and an exceptionally polished Philharmonic string ensemble 
consisting of violinist Mitchell Newman, violist Evan Wilson and cellist Barry 
Gold. 
</P>
<P>
The concert's problems were concentrated at its midsection, in Prokofiev's 
duskily gorgeous String Quartet in B minor. 
</P>
<P>
Led with slapdash brilliance, at breakneck tempos by violinist Mischa 
Lefkowitz, the composer's chamber masterpiece was rudely cuffed about in its 
first movement and came unglued in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Second violinist Yun Tang was able to sustain the frenetic pace without damage 
to her sweet, firm tone and violist Ralph Fielding stayed the course with honor 
largely intact. But cellist Stephen Custer buckled under the strain, while 
Lefkowitz proved his own as well as the ensemble's most potent adversary, 
forcing his tone mercilessly and playing havoc with intonation. 
</P>
<P>
The ensemble did settle down to a coherent account of the slow, exquisitely sad 
finale. But a third of Prokofiev's quartet isn't enough.HERBERT GLASS

FEEL-GOOD NIGHT WITH ROGERS' 'CHRISTMAS,' 'JULIE AND CAROL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two feel-good specials arrive tonight. The first, with Kenny Rogers, is 
synthetic, but the other one actually lets you feel good without feeling 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
The second and more successful of the shows is "Julie and Carol: Together 
Again" (10 p.m., Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42). Taped in June at the Pantages 
Theatre, it has no particular connection to the holidays. Yet any day is a 
holiday when Julie Andrews and Carol Burnett get together. 
</P>
<P>
An undemanding, anxiety-free holiday, that is. "Julie and Carol" doesn't offer 
biting comedy or sensational music, but it's greater than its parts. The stars 
are so likable that their glow warms up the coldest TV tube. 
</P>
<P>
This is the duo's third televised outing, following shows at Carnegie Hall 
(1962) and Lincoln Center (1971). 
</P>
<P>
They do a middle-aged rap routine, "Mama's All Right," which shows off their 
dexterity -- and their legs. Then they sit down for tea in Bob Mackie's 
frilliest dresses -- a scene that soon degenerates into raucous slapstick, 
allowing them to poke fun at the image of their undying friendship that's so 
evident in the rest of the show. 
</P>
<P>
Next up is a once-over-lightly medley of tunes from the last two decades, 
followed by a parody of "Phantom of the Opera," country &amp; Western style. 
Burnett is as funny as ever in the dual roles of a country diva with a towering 
hairdo and the mysterious Phantom. 
</P>
<P>
The show's opening and closing use Stephen Sondheim's rousing "Old Friends," 
from "Merrily We Roll Along," without giving credit. Minus the medley tunes, 
the rest of the music was written by producers Ken and Mitzie Welch. Jeff 
Margolis directed, with musical numbers fluidly staged by Kevin Carlisle. 
</P>
<P>
Preceding "Julie and Carol" is "Christmas in America: A Love Story" (9 p.m., 
Channels 4, 36 and 39), which is like a glossy, hourlong camera commercial 
(though in fact the sponsor is K mart). A photographer (Kenny Rogers), on the 
eve of a museum showing of his work that happens to coincide with the Christmas 
holidays, recalls his past pivotal Christmases. 
</P>
<P>
The first flashback takes him to boyhood, when his father finally started to 
act like a father -- with the gift of a camera. Next, he recalls how he courted 
his future wife by taking pictures of her. 
</P>
<P>
Then we see how she died while he was away shooting pictures (OK, maybe this 
chapter wouldn't fit so well into a camera commercial). Finally, he reconciles 
with his own son (Kenny Rogers Jr.), after the young man -- himself a new 
father -- finally goes to see the photo exhibit, which includes family 
pictures. 
</P>
<P>
To his credit, Rogers Jr. performs his underwritten role well, and the show has 
a professional sheen. Eric Till directed from a script by Earl Hamner Jr. ("The 
Waltons") and Donald Sipes. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Christmas connection is extremely tenuous. The production isn't much 
more than a chance for Rogers to show off his son and his photos. 
</P>
<P>
At least he doesn't try to play himself in his first two flashbacks. Nor does 
he sing, except in a Dolly Parton-written title tune over the closing credits.

MTV OFFERS RAPID-FIRE RETROSPECTIVE OF '80S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the 1980s were just like one long rock video to you, full of 
rapid-succession sound bytes with a musical overlay, then "MTV's Decade" -- a 
two-hour retrospective premiering on the cable network tonight at 9 -- will 
seem just the appropriate capper. 
</P>
<P>
"You might call it the Awareness Generation," says upbeat interviewee Jesse 
Jackson, looking back through rainbow-colored glasses. Meanwhile, the 
rapid-fire pace of the dizzying two hours makes clear that its producers don't 
expect anyone in the MTV generation to have anything resembling an attention 
span, aware or no. 
</P>
<P>
Produced by MTV News, the narrationless special is full of interview clips of 
interesting folk (Eric Bogosian, John Malkovich, Don Henley) and vacuous celebs 
(George Michael, Tina Turner) alike, all getting about 3 to 10 seconds at a pop 
to utter witticisms about the decade -- quips that tease more than they 
illuminate. A byte is more than you need of Roseanne Barr's banality, but Spike 
Lee, like him or not, deserves more. 
</P>
<P>
Segments on AIDS and racism are dropped in alongside those on such cataclysmic 
topics as the selling out of rock stars; all of them work better as musical 
montages than as information. For wisdom, the show even resorts to Aerosmith's 
Steve Tyler repeating his unseen interviewer's questions: "Is AIDS God's way of 
maybe telling us we're doing something wrong? I don't think so," he muses, 
blankly. At least TV-savvy folk like Sandra Bernhard ("The difference between a 
freedom fighter and a terrorist is whether I agree with that person's cause or 
not") get some zingers in in their alloted seconds. 
</P>
<P>
There's also some self-mythologizing about MTV's own part in the historicity of 
the decade, though with a couple of amusing opposing viewpoints: "It's really 
been a horror, because I really hate that kind of MTV edit where there's a cut 
every two seconds," says Spike Lee. Wonder what he will think of this special, 
which operates on very nearly the same principle. 
</P>
<P>
The program repeats Sunday at 2 p.m., and airs Dec. 21 and 24.

ROBINSON LIKES HIS CALLS, NOT RESULTS; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: COACH REFUSES TO BACK DOWN ON FAKE FIELD GOAL AND WON'T BENCH KICK 
RETURNER RON BROWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pinned in a corner, first by the San Francisco 49ers, then by some inquiring 
media minds, Ram Coach John Robinson lashed back Tuesday, again defending a 
fake field goal call and denying a fourth-quarter collapse that cost the Rams a 
17-point lead and Monday night's game, 30-27. 
</P>
<P>
With his team teetering on an emotional ledge, Robinson rushed to the forefront 
to take on all challengers. The Rams didn't choke in Monday's game, he 
insisted, even if two fumbles in the last 6 minutes 27 seconds led directly to 
two 49er touchdowns and the devastating loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, instead, lost with poise and dignity, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson stood by his call for the fake field goal and defended kick returner 
Ron Brown's second deadly fumble in two weeks. He also talked about rebounds 
and comebacks, and a possible rematch with the 49ers in the NFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no time or reason to allow yourself to get discouraged," Robinson 
said. "If you are discouraged, and go in the tank, you've got to let someone 
else go to the playoffs. . . . We've got a great chance. We've got a chance to 
go to the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
If it seems only human nature to commiserate after an emotional outpouring, 
Robinson isn't accepting it. Look forward, not back. The glass is half full. 
</P>
<P>
"It's also human nature to get (ticked) off, play hard and come back and win," 
Robinson countered. "We get to choose what human nature we want. We're not 
compelled to feel sorry for ourselves. We played the best we could. It was a 
hell of a football game. It was one of the most exciting three hours I've ever 
spent in my life. And anyone who was there and didn't get caught up in it is 
just a fool." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of fools, that's what Robinson considers anyone who still 
second-guesses his decision to fake a 21-yard field goal try on fourth and goal 
at the 49ers' four with a 17-3 lead and 3:22 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Holder Pete Holohan, of course, was stopped short of the end zone. The 49ers 
took over and scored two plays later on a 92-yard pass play, Joe Montana to 
John Taylor, which cut the Rams' lead to 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams ended up losing by three points, the mathematical difference of the 
field goal not attempted. 
</P>
<P>
"I know several of you were critical of the call," Robinson said, echoing his 
sentiments of Monday night. "But I think you're wrong. . . . It was an 
excellent call, based on the information we had, and we came within six inches 
of it working. I had thought about it right before the start of the game. I 
talked to both players (Holohan and kicker Mike Lansford) on the sidelines 
before the play. I had anticipated it two plays before, had it ready to go and 
ran it." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson also insisted again that the game was never in hand, even as his 
quarterback, Jim Everett, stood over center at the 49ers' four-yard line with a 
10-point lead and seven minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
There, Doug Smith's center snap stuck in the mud and San Francisco recovered 
the fumble. 
</P>
<P>
"No, we didn't have them beat!" Robinson said. "No we didn't! When you have 
them beat is when you have more points and there's no time left. To assume that 
a lead at a certain point was safe, I can't accept that, and never did during 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing we did was get them inside their own five. How can I not say 
it was bad to fumble the ball on their three? We go down to the three (four, 
actually) and some strange thing happened. Doug Smith's concentration didn't 
slip. It was a freak thing that happened." 
</P>
<P>
The other crucial blow was Brown's fumbled kickoff, which gave the 49ers the 
ball at the Rams' 27 with 6:15 left. 
</P>
<P>
That's two blunders in two weeks for Brown at the most inopportune time, but 
Robinson said he's not going to pull Brown off the return team. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the thing you have to do when something goes wrong with a player is to 
get him back playing good," Robinson said. "Unless there's something that he 
can't come back from. Individuals don't lose games. I cannot ever accept that. 
I never will." 
</P>
<P>
So where do the Rams go from here? To the playoffs as a wild card, most likely. 
Despite Monday's loss, the Rams are in a strong position, although playing host 
to a wild-card game now seems less likely. 
</P>
<P>
If the playoffs began today, the Rams, 9-5, would play the New York Giants, 
10-4, in the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams can clinch a wild-card spot with wins over the New York Jets here 
Sunday and at New England on Christmas Eve. They can also qualify at 10-6, if 
either Washington, 8-6, or Green Bay, 8-6, loses again, or if either 
Philadelphia or the Giants lose twice. 
</P>
<P>
At 10-6, the Rams win head-to-head tiebreakers with Green Bay or Washington but 
lose a three-way tie with the Packers and Redskins, Green Bay getting the nod 
because of a better conference record. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The left knee injury Bill Hawkins suffered will not require immediate surgery, 
the Rams reported, but the rookie from Miami will be lost for at least three 
weeks, effectively ending his season unless the Rams progress through the 
playoffs. Hawkins has a partially torn ligament and his knee will be 
re-examined after "two to three weeks of rehabilitation." 
</P>
<P>
The injury leaves the defensive line ragged. Rookie Brian Smith, a linebacker 
who spent the first 13 weeks on injured reserve, will move into the right 
defensive end spot. The Rams have already lost starters Doug Reed (ankle 
sprain) and Mike Piel (dislocated elbow), although the club says Piel could be 
back for the New England game in two weeks. To replace Hawkins, the Rams will 
either activate rookie linebacker Mark Messner this week or go outside for 
help. . . . Ron Brown now has half as many fumbles, two, as receptions, four, 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Ellard's return to the lineup after missing two weeks with a hamstring 
strain was not awe-inspiring. He caught two passes for 38 yards against the 
49ers. "The leg was bothering him the whole game," Coach John Robinson said. 
"He was very limited in his role." . . . Quarterback Jim Everett might have 
clinched the second Pro Bowl spot behind Joe Montana with his 239-yard, 
two-touchdown effort Monday night. Everett put some distance between himself 
and his closest competitor, Green Bay's Don Majkowski. Everett, who ranks 
second behind Montana in the NFC with a 91.5 rating, leads the NFL with 3,856 
yards and 26 touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE RAMS BY THE NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
HIGHLIGHT 
</P>
<P>
JOE MONTANA 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco 49er quarterback proved quite convincingly Monday night he 
isn't ready to five up his title as 1) the National Football League's best 
quarterback or 2) the League's best at bringing his team from behind in the 
games's final minutes. Playing with a flak jacket, bruised ribs and the pain 
deadened by a shot of Novocain, all he did was throw for a career-best 458 
yards by completing 30 of 42 passes. Two of those were intercepted, but Montana 
kept his team's chances alive by making game-saving tackles. In the game's 
final 13:34, he completed 8 of 9 passes for 183 yards and two touchdowns to 
bring his team back from a 27-10 deficit.

<P>
Record-setting defensive back Tim Manning of Trabuco Hills High School and 
multi-talented lineman Oscar Wilson of Santa Ana head the list of selections 
for The Times' 31st All-Orange County football team. 
</P>
<P>
Manning led Trabuco Hills to the Southern Section Division VIII championship 
and capped an impressive, three-year career by intercepting his 24th pass to 
establish a county record. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson became the first defensive player honored as a first-team selection for 
three consecutive years since the teams were introduced in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Manning made a successful transition from wide receiver to quarterback this 
season, replacing graduated senior David Lowery. Manning passed for 2,200 yards 
and 17 touchdowns and rushed for 559 yards as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
He also emerged as one of the county's best defensive backs as a sophomore, 
intercepting 10 passes and continuing his record pace with 10 more as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
Manning's athletic feats aren't limited to the football field, however. Last 
year, he was a starting guard on the Trabuco Hills' basketball team that won 
the Southern Section 3-A title and advanced to the state Division III 
championship game in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's presence on the defensive line helped Santa Ana win three consecutive 
Century League titles. He became the first underclassman to win the county's 
lineman of the year award as a junior and could become only the second player 
to win either the back or lineman of the year award twice. Myron White of Santa 
Ana Valley was named back of the year in 1973 and '74. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro, runner-up to Division III champion Paramount, had three players 
honored on the first team: the pass-catch combination of quarterback Steve 
Stenstrom and wide receiver Rob Johnson and offensive tackle David Cuttrell. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson follows his brother, Bret, who was a two-time selection at quarterback 
in 1986 and '87 and was the county's back of the year as a senior. Rob Johnson 
is the only underclassman selected to the first team. 
</P>
<P>
Three members of the South Coast League -- Capistrano Valley, El Toro and 
Mission Viejo -- dominate the teams. El Toro placed five players, Capistrano 
Valley was represented by three and Mission Viejo had two players honored. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Psaros, who helped lead Capistrano Valley to the county's mythical 
championship, moves up to the first team this year after being honored as a 
second-team selection last season. Capistrano Valley also placed wide receiver 
Dave Poltl and defensive back Jeremy Brion on the second team. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time Division VI champion Corona del Mar placed two players -- linebacker 
Jerrott Willard and defensive back Warren Johnson -- on the first team. 
</P>
<P>
The backfield includes Stenstrom, fullback Brian Pizula of Sunny Hills and 
tailback Coy Collins of Loara. Collins rewrote the record book at Loara and 
Pizula became the school's single-season rushing leader at Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The offensive line is one of the biggest in the 31 years the teams have been 
selected, with first-team selections Ryan Motherway, Darren Correll, Chris 
Coons and Cuttrell weighing a total of 1,220 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Four underclassmen -- Poltl and Brion of Capistrano Valley, tackle Brian 
Pearsall of Villa Park and Fullerton linebacker D.C. Olsen -- were named to the 
second team. 
</P>
<P>
The teams were chosen after the county's 58 coaches were polled and ballots 
returned. Players were selected regardless of their class. The back, lineman 
and coach of the year awards will be announced at 9 a.m. Sunday during a 
ceremony at the Anaheim Hilton and Towers Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The players named to the first team, their parents and coaches will be invited 
to the brunch, with Stanford Coach Dennis Green as guest speaker. Each player 
will be given a certificate and a plaque. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Dwyre, The Times' sports editor, will present the Glenn Davis trophy to 
the outstanding prep player in Southern California. Former Servite star Derek 
Brown was the recipient of the award last year.

QUARTERBACK 
</P>
<P>
STEVE STENSTROM 
</P>
<P>
EL TORO, 6-2, 195, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Stenstrom completed 178 of 270 passes for 2,830 yards and 25 touchdowns. 
Stenstrom's passing yardage total is the fifth highest for a season in county 
history. He completed 66% of his passes, but was intercepted five times in four 
playoff games. Stenstrom had a two-year passing total of 4,604 yards. He's 
being recruited by Stanford, Oregon and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
RUNNING BACK 
</P>
<P>
COY COLLINS 
</P>
<P>
LOARA, 5-8, 155, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Collins rewrote Loara's record book in three years, establishing career marks 
for yardage (3,011), carries (435), touchdowns (30) and average per carry 
(6.9). Among the single-season school marks he established this year were: 
yardage (1,680), touchdowns (20) and average per carry (8.6). He has the 
school's longest touchdown run (95 yards) and punt return (83 yards). 
</P>
<P>
RUNNING BACK 
</P>
<P>
BRIAN PIZULA 
</P>
<P>
SUNNY HILLS, 5-10, 195, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Pizula, named the most valuable player of the Freeway League, rushed for 1,483 
yards and 21 touchdowns. Sunny Hills' only defeat came when Pizula injured his 
shoulder. He is a blue-collar worker who runs with power at his fullback 
position. Pizula also exceled at linebacker for Sunny Hills, which allowed an 
average of 5.5 points per game. He also is a three-time league champion 
wrestler at 165 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
CENTER 
</P>
<P>
CHRIS COONS 
</P>
<P>
ESTANCIA, 6-2, 220, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
A three-year starter, Coons was one of the key players in Estancia's rise from 
2-8 in 1987 to 7-3-1 in 1988 and then 10-1 in 1989. He was an all-league player 
for two years and was named to the National Football Foundation's 
scholar-athlete team as a junior with a 4.2 grade-point average. Coons' 
teammates voted him as the team's top lineman for two consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
OFFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
RYAN MOTHERWAY 
</P>
<P>
MATER DEI, 6-4, 255, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Motherway, a three-year starter for Mater Dei, was consistently graded by his 
coaches at 90% or better for his blocking technique. Motherway is the youngest 
of three brothers to play on the Monarchs' offensive line, following Tom (Class 
of 1984) and Mike ('86); both went on to play college football. Ryan started 
last year on a line that weighed a combined 1,295 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
OFFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
TOM COWEN 
</P>
<P>
WESTERN, 6-5, 240, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Cowen, a two-way performer, was named the lineman of the year in the Orange 
League. He compiled some impressive numbers defensively, getting eight sacks 
and causing four fumbles, but college recruiters project him as an offensive 
tackle because of his height, quickness and balance. Cowen has a 3.0 
grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
OFFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
DAVID CUTTRELL 
</P>
<P>
EL TORO, 6-5, 245, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Cuttrell blossomed into a bona fide college prospect as a senior after 
extensive off-season weight training following a junior year in which he 
struggled. He weighed 10 pounds 13 ounces at birth and fits the 
larger-than-life image of his hero, John Wayne, with his imposing size and 
strength. He also excels in the classroom with a 3.1 grade-point average and 
1,070 Scholastic Aptitude Test score. 
</P>
<P>
OFFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
DARREN CORRELL 
</P>
<P>
SUNNY HILLS, 6-2, 260, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
The right guard played a major role in the success of Sunny Hills' ground game. 
One of the quickest linemen in the county, Correll was equally adept at pulling 
or straight-ahead blocking for talented runners Brian Pizula, Ken Overby and 
Mike Sullivan. Sunny Hills did not emphasize the pass, but Correll is also an 
efficient pass blocker. He's being recruited by Oregon, Cal State Fullerton and 
Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
TIGHT END 
</P>
<P>
BRIAN HIGGINS 
</P>
<P>
EDISON, 6-1, 195, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins established a school record for passes caught in one season, catching 
63 for 860 yards and three touchdowns. He broke Rick Justice's mark of 58 
receptions set in 1985. Higgins had his best games against two of the best 
teams in the Southern Section. He caught nine passes against Capistrano Valley, 
the county's No. 1 team, and eight passes against Fontana, the Division I 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
WIDE RECEIVER 
</P>
<P>
DOUG WEAVER 
</P>
<P>
FOUNTAIN VALLEY, 6-1, 180, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Weaver was the only returning starter off Fountain Valley's 1988 Division I 
championship team. He caught 45 passes for 742 yards and five touchdowns as a 
junior. This season, Weaver caught 54 passes for 863 yards -- averaging 16 
yards per reception -- and scored 10 touchdowns. He set a school record for one 
game with 14 catches for 229 yards against El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
WIDE RECEIVER 
</P>
<P>
ROB JOHNSON 
</P>
<P>
EL TORO, 6-4, 195, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is the second family member to earn all-county honors, following 
brother Bret, who was back of the year in '87. Rob started at defensive back as 
a sophomore and moved to receiver this season. He caught 65 passes for 1,107 
yards -- averaging 17 yards per reception -- and 10 touchdowns. He caught nine 
passes for 145 yards in the Division III title game. 
</P>
<P>
KICKER 
</P>
<P>
MATT LOGAN 
</P>
<P>
LA QUINTA, 6-2, 185, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Logan's 50-yard field goal against Los Amigos was the longest in the county 
this season. He also kicked a 49-yard field goal and was successful on 12 of 17 
attempts. Logan kicked four field goals in the Division VI playoffs, including 
a 45-yarder against La Mirada in the semifinals. Logan's 12 field goals ties 
him for ninth on the county's all-time list. He also made 32 of 35 conversion 
kicks.

DEFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
OSCAR WILSON 
</P>
<P>
SANTA ANA, 6-3, 235, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being double teamed most of the season, Wilson was an impact player who 
dominated at nose guard or defensive end. He was a major force in Santa Ana's 
17-14 upset victory over Loyola, recording four sacks, batting down a pass and 
forcing a fumble. He also showed his versatility in his final prep game, 
catching a 48-yard touchdown pass. Wilson was an all-league basketball player 
as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
DAMON PSAROS 
</P>
<P>
CAPISTRANO VALLEY, 6-0, 210, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Few played harder or with more determination than Psaros during his three-year 
career as the Cougars' nose guard. He often doubled as a fullback in goal-line 
situations, but his strength was pass rushing. Psaros' quickness and 
aggressiveness allowed him to routinely beat opposing linemen who were 
sometimes bigger. Psaros was a second-team selection as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
MARK SLYMEN 
</P>
<P>
MISSION VIEJO, 6-3, 245, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Slymen was the co-captain of the best defensive team in the county, recording 
eight sacks at tackle. Mission Viejo had four shutouts this year and was 22-4 
over the past two seasons with Slymen in the lineup. Mission Viejo advanced to 
the Division III semifinals two consecutive years. He was a first-team 
all-league selection in the South Coast League for two seasons in a row. 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
HARTWELL BROWN 
</P>
<P>
LOS ALAMITOS, 6-4, 240, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was a force at defensive end for the county's top-ranked team in the 
preseason. He combined speed and strength to overpower opponents. Brown's size 
potential has been attractive to major colleges. One of Brown's most impressive 
statistics came off the field, however. He scored 1,410 on the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
LINEBACKER 
</P>
<P>
GREGG CLAPPER 
</P>
<P>
MISSION VIEJO, 6-1, 210, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Co-captain of the county's best defensive team, Clapper was a three-year 
starter with a reputation for being one of the hardest hitters in the county. 
Mission Viejo compiled a 33-6 record in three seasons with Clapper in the 
lineup. Clapper was a starter on the Diablos' 4-A division championship soccer 
team as a junior and is undecided whether he will play soccer or football in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
LINEBACKER 
</P>
<P>
DAVID McLEOD 
</P>
<P>
MARINA, 6-0, 205, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
McLeod is the only first-team selection who played for a team with a losing 
record. He set single-season school records for total tackles (129), lead 
tackles (82) and assists (47). McLeod also had six sacks and caused eight 
incomplete passes. He was named the defensive player of the year in the Sunset 
League even though Marina finished 3-7, after going 0-10 last season. 
</P>
<P>
LINEBACKER 
</P>
<P>
JERROTT WILLARD 
</P>
<P>
CORONA DEL MAR, 6-2, 215, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Willard was overshadowed by all-county linebacker John Katovsich. 
This year, Willard became his team's defensive leader and helped Corona del Mar 
shut out three of four playoff opponents. He was a linebacker by trade, a 
running back by request and a kicker out of necessity, but he managed field 
goals of 47, 45 and 43 yards. Corona del Mar was 23-3-2 with Willard in the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
LINEBACKER 
</P>
<P>
SCOTT STRINI 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE, 6-2, 215, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Orange had won only 18 games in this decade prior to this season, when the 
Panthers emerged with a 10-3-1 record. Strini, a three-year starter at outside 
linebacker and offensive guard, helped Orange advance to the Division VIII 
championship game; it marked the school's first appearance in a football 
championship in 60 years. Strini's older brother, Joe, started for Orange in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE BACK 
</P>
<P>
DOUG CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
<P>
HUNTINGTON BEACH, 6-2, 195, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham ranks with Danny Thompson and Jason McGehee as the top running backs 
at Huntington Beach in this decade. He exceled at strong safety, where he had 
six interceptions. He also played wide receiver and quarterback during his 
three-year career. He rushed for 812 yards and scored 14 touchdowns as a 
senior. 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE BACK 
</P>
<P>
TIM MANNING 
</P>
<P>
TRABUCO HILLS, 5-11, 165, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Manning became the county's career interception leader with 24 when he picked 
off a pass against Orange in the Division VIII championship game. He broke 
David Hill's mark of 23 set from 1982-84 at Mission Viejo. Manning also played 
quarterback, passing for 2,200 yards and 17 touchdowns to lead Trabuco Hills to 
its second consecutive Division VIII title. 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE BACK 
</P>
<P>
WARREN JOHNSON 
</P>
<P>
CORONA DEL MAR, 6-2, 175, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson intercepted 15 passes in his two years as a starter, helping Corona del 
Mar win consecutive Division VI championships. He had five interceptions in 
four playoff games as a junior, and caught 37 passes for 564 yards as a senior 
despite missing two games. Johnson also was a starter on the school's 
basketball team that advanced to the 3-A division title game last season.

Santa Fe Railway to Start Delivery Service: Santa Fe Railway has formed a 
partnership with J. B. Hunt Transport, an Arkansas trucking company, to make 
door-to-door shipments in the Los Angeles and Chicago areas. The partnership, 
to be called Quantum, is directed at shippers of high-value merchandise, such 
as china or furniture, who do not normally ship by rail. Santa Fe said it 
expects Quantum to earn a profit immediately and to bring in $90 million in 
revenue in two to three years.

President Bush will travel to Cartagena, Colombia, in mid-February for a drug 
summit with three South American leaders, but his stay will be limited to just 
a few hours because of security concerns, an Administration official said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be identified, said Feb. 15 has been tentatively 
selected for the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has said he wants to go to Colombia to demonstrate his determination to 
face down the drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-month-old drug war between the Bogota government and the country's 
cocaine barons escalated with the Dec. 6 truck bombing that killed 63 people 
and wounded more than 650 in Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
The drug cartels have been blamed for that explosion and for the deaths of 111 
people two weeks ago, when a Colombian passenger jet was blown up.

The Philippine House of Representatives today voted President Corazon Aquino 
emergency powers for 90 days to help her rebuild the economy and thwart further 
coup attempts. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate, expected to approve a similar bill, postponed its vote for a day 
after the opposition sparked a marathon debate on a provision that would allow 
Aquino to take over public utilities and related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The two chambers are to present a joint bill to Aquino, who is expected to sign 
it into law this week. 
</P>
<P>
The law would grant Aquino, who this month survived the sixth coup attempt 
against her, powers to seize firearms, take over public utilities, fix prices, 
regulate power supplies and confiscate hoarded food. 
</P>
<P>
The lower house denied Aquino some of the wider authority she had requested, 
including the power to ban strikes and suspend labor laws and an open-ended 
provision that some legislators said would have given her lawmaking powers.

O.C. GETS SECOND MALATHION SPRAYING; MORE BEING PLANNED

<P>
With the second malathion spraying in Orange County history successfully behind 
them, county agricultural officials today were awaiting word from the state on 
a schedule for future sprayings in its northern areas. 
</P>
<P>
At about 11:15 p.m. Tuesday, three specially equipped helicopters finished 
spraying hundreds of gallons of pesticide mix over about a 9-square-mile area 
of Orange County that included parts of La Habra, Brea and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural officials now plan to spray there as many as a dozen times to try 
to halt the spread of the crop-destroying pest. The spraying was prompted by 
the discovery of a pregnant Mediterranean fruit fly Nov. 17 in a trap set in a 
Brea guava tree. 
</P>
<P>
The northern area likely will be sprayed once every three weeks during the next 
few months, with spraying coming more frequently as the weather warms in the 
spring. A schedule for spraying around the Southland could come from the state 
this week, local officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents have questioned assertions by agricultural officials that the 
malathion mix poses no health risk. But most elected officials in the affected 
area have voiced support for the multi-spraying approach and, unlike Los 
Angeles County, no formal opposition has developed.

CENTRAL AMERICA: NO EVIDENCE THAT CONN. WOMAN HELPED HIDE WEAPONS, PRESIDENT

President Alfredo Cristiani said today that an American accused of storing 
weapons for leftist rebels will be released from prison because there is no 
evidence that she helped conceal the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani said that Jennifer Casolo, 28, of Thomaston, Conn., will probably be 
released later today and deported Thursday but that she will be asked to remain 
available as a witness in the case. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cristiani told a news conference that he thought Casolo probably had 
in fact cooperated with rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front, who launched a major urban offensive in San Salvador last month. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani said she is being released only because of lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I am morally convinced that Miss Casolo is guilty," Cristiani said. 
</P>
<P>
The president said he had not been pressured by the government of the United 
States to order Casolo's release. The United States is a key financial 
supporter of the rightist government in its war with the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) said earlier today that he had been told in 
telephone conversations with Salvadoran officials, including Cristiani, that 
Casolo will be released and expelled from the country by Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Cristiani "informs me that the judge in her case has ultimately concluded the 
charges against Jennifer were not fully supported by the evidence, and that she 
could not thus be fairly prosecuted under Salvadoran law," Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo went to El Salvador in 1985 to work for Christian Education Seminars, a 
group that organizes tours for Americans to learn about the 10-year-old civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo and two Salvadoran friends were arrested Nov. 26 after a police raid on 
her house in San Salvador. From the walled garden behind the house, police 
said, they uncovered 103 mortar grenades, 213 blocks of dynamite, 405 
detonators, 150 feet of slow-burning fuse and 21,945 rounds of ammunition for 
Soviet-made automatic rifles.

A Navy submarine successfully launched a Trident 2 missile today without 
interference from Greenpeace anti-nuclear protesters who had threatened to 
enter the safety zone, the Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
The launch from the submerged nuclear submarine Tennessee was the second 
straight successful undersea firing of the Navy's newest and deadliest nuclear 
weapon. Two of the first three submarine tests failed explosively. 
</P>
<P>
A 60-foot Greenpeace ketch, the Mondeivitano, was on the scene but did not 
attempt to enter a safety zone after the Navy warned it to keep away, the Navy 
said. On Dec. 4, a Navy ship damaged a Greenpeace vessel with 25 protesters 
aboard by bumping it and using fire hoses to pour water down the smokestacks, 
stopping the engines.

Young Muslim men celebrated the militants' release by shooting off firecrackers 
in Srinagar, the summer capital of India's northernmost state of Jammu-Kashmir, 
which borders Pakistan. About 3,000 people shouted anti-India slogans and waved 
the national flag of Pakistan, which has fought three wars with India over 
Kashmir.

Sayeed, 22, was abducted at gunpoint Dec. 8 as she was going home from her job

<P>
The ruling Communist Party in Bulgaria, responding to increasing popular calls 
for change, today renounced its leading role in running the country and ousted 
disgraced former leader Todor Zhivkov and two former Politburo members. 
</P>
<P>
The official BTA news agency said a meeting of the party's policy-making 
Central Committee decided to ask the National Assembly to repeal two clauses in 
the constitution that empower the Communists with the "construction of an 
advanced socialist society." 
</P>
<P>
"The Bulgarian Communist Party renounces its leading role in society and 
state," BTA said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Central Committee decided to expel Zhivkov, along with his son 
Vladimir and Milko Balev, who were widely regarded as close Zhivkov allies and 
architects of his hard-line policies, the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The announcements came on the third day of the Central Committee meeting in 
Sofia that has convened under new leader Petar Mladenov to discuss its response 
to further calls for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's ruling Communists, eager not to lag behind in the whirlwind of 
change sweeping Eastern Europe, followed similar moves by East Germany and 
Czechoslovakia in voting themselves out of power. 
</P>
<P>
BTA said the proposal to repeal the two clauses of the constitution will be put 
to the Communist-dominated National Assembly at a session Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The two clauses read: "The Bulgarian Communist Party is the leading force in 
society and in the state" and "The Bulgarian Communist Party heads the 
construction of an advanced socialist society in the People's Republic of 
Bulgaria in close cooperation with the Bulgarian Agrarian Party." 
</P>
<P>
With today's dismissal, Zhivkov, who ruled Bulgaria for 35 years, loses all 
authority in the Communist Party. Ousted as party leader and head of state last 
month, he was expelled from the Central Committee in a second party clean-out 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
His 37-year old son Vladimir was responsible for the party's Culture 
Department. He and Balev were jettisoned from the Politburo in the November 
purge. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats in Sofia said the fact that the Zhivkovs and Balev had now 
been expelled from the party means they could go on trial.

Poland and Hungary today outlined their economic reforms at a meeting with 24 
Western nations that are coordinating aid to prevent Eastern Europe's reforms 
from being derailed by economic troubles. 
</P>
<P>
In separate presentations, Polish Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski and 
Gyula Horn, his Hungarian counterpart, said their countries were creating 
market-oriented economies. 
</P>
<P>
Also, they said, they will soon conclude talks with the International Monetary 
Fund for financial rescue packages that would free extra Western loans and help 
in easing their huge foreign debts. 
</P>
<P>
In return, the IMF insists that both countries adopt sound economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our most important aims is to shape a healthy . . . enterprise 
structure," Horn told the foreign ministers of the donor nations, including the 
United States, the 12 European Community countries, Japan, Canada and 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Skubiszewski detailed efforts to "demonopolize" the Polish economy "by opening 
wider the doors to free enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
Hungary and Poland have been at the forefront of the democratic changes 
reshaping Eastern Europe. Poland has the East Bloc's first non-Communist 
premier, and Hungary has opened its borders, promised multiparty elections and 
formally disbanded the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said both East European officials were questioned by several 
delegations about details of their economic reform programs and the measure of 
support they have in Warsaw and Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the first between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and his 
23 counterparts since President Bush and other world leaders suggested an aid 
program for Eastern Europe at a summit meeting in Paris in July. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama said today that the talks were "of 
great significance." 
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely important to remove . . . the economic hardships which 
confront Poland and Hungary and to enhance the smooth implementation of the 
economic reconstruction and development so that budding reform in the two 
countries will develop unimpaired and finally bear fruit." 
</P>
<P>
Nakayama said his government was prepared to offer $150 million to an economic 
stabilization fund for Poland as soon as the Warsaw government reaches an 
agreement with the IMF. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington today, the White House announced that the United States will put 
up $200 million toward a $500-million temporary loan for Poland as it awaits 
economic help from the IMF.

S.C. FIRM FINED $580,000 FOR ILLEGAL HIRING; 
</P>

IMMIGRATION: THE LEVY AGAINST PIEDMONT QUILTING IS THE LARGEST ON RECORD UNDER

Federal immigration authorities today levied a record $580,000 fine on a South 
Carolina textile company accused of hiring scores of illegal aliens, including 
children as young as 12. 
</P>
<P>
The administrative fine for Piedmont Quilting Corp. of Walhalla, S.C., is the 
largest under the 1986 law that contains criminal and civil penalties for 
knowingly employing illegal aliens, the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's announcement came a day after the company and 11 employees and 
executives were indicted in Greenville, S.C., on federal criminal charges 
related to the hiring of 117 illegal aliens from Mexico and Peru. 
</P>
<P>
The administrative fine covers the employment of 85 illegal aliens, the INS 
said. The fine also covers the company's failure to comply with procedures to 
verify that more than 400 employees were not illegal aliens, it said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is in defiance of the congressional mandate to prevent illegal aliens 
from obtaining employment in this country," INS Commissioner Gene McNary said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
McNary said the agency's action "should be a clear sign to those who have any 
doubts that the Immigration and Naturalization Service is strongly committed to 
enforcing the employer sanctions" in the 1986 law. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents raided the company last July in what was called the biggest 
crackdown on the employment of illegal aliens outside south Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Piedmont Quilting's attorney said the illegal aliens presented the company with 
false documentation in order to get hired.

U.S. retailers' sales rebounded in November, the government said today in a 
report analysts saw as showing stronger than expected Christmas buying and less 
chance of a recession.

The 0.8% increase, the biggest in four months, "clearly signals that the 
economy is resilient," said Richard W. Rahn, chief economist for the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce. "Fears of a poor Christmas retail season should abate with 
this report." 
</P>
<P>
"It's clearly stronger than was expected," said David Jones, an economist with 
Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a New York government securities dealer. "As long 
as spending holds up, there's no threat of a recession." 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that sales rose to a seasonally adjusted $144.6 
billion in November after plummeting 1.3% in October, when they were driven 
down by skidding automobile sales. The October sales were revised after 
originally being reported to have fallen 1%. 
</P>
<P>
Many economists were expecting only a weak improvement in November since unit 
car sales fell again in that month. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group in Washington, said the 0.5% 
increase in the automotive category probably reflected an increase in prices, 
not sales. Excluding the auto category, the report was even more positive, 
showing a 0.9% advance. 
</P>
<P>
Jones suggested a shift in Christmas present buying patterns might have 
contributed to the November strength and might mean more moderate growth this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting more and more spending in the last week of November and less in 
the first weeks of December," he said. "The way to measure the Christmas season 
now is to average the November and December spending patterns." 
</P>
<P>
And Shaber added, "It's taken a lot of price-slashing to get those sales. So 
even if dollar sales are decent this Christmas, it's unclear whether the 
profits will be so great." 
</P>
<P>
Retail sales account for about one-third of the nation's economic activity. 
David Wyss, senior financial economist for DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass., 
said the stronger November report caused him to boost his estimate of overall 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Wyss said if strong sales continue in December, the gross national product 
could increase at a 1% rate in the final quarter of the year instead of the 
0.5% he had been predicting. 
</P>
<P>
"This relieves the worries that the fourth quarter could turn into a negative 
quarter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not all analysts were as upbeat, however. Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at 
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York, pointed out that sales in both 
September and October had been revised downward. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we are going to have a recession, but it is still iffy," 
Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
There had been concern that Christmas spending would be held back by a slowing 
economy, reflecting Federal Reserve policy of holding down inflation by 
tightening credit. 
</P>
<P>
But even sales of durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to last at least 
three years -- posted a 0.7% gain after falling 3% in October. These sales 
often are affected by the Fed's interest-rate policies because many are 
financed by loans.

Belgium's Sabena S.A. said today it is setting up a new airline company with 
two other European carriers, British Airways and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Sabena S.A., the holding company for the Belgian carrier, will own 60% of the 
new company, to be called Sabena World Airlines. British Airways and KLM will 
each own 20% of the new business venture and each will pay $54 million for 
their stake, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
British Airways said the new corporation will create the "first truly European 
airline." 
</P>
<P>
The new company will link the operations of the three airlines into a tight 
network allowing same-day round-trip travel between 75 European cities around 
the new Euro-hub center at Brussels' Zaventem International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The new corporation will not affect the existing structure and operations of 
the three European airlines, nor will it result in layoffs at Sabena, the 
Belgian carrier said.

McDonald's Corp. said today that more than 25,000 Muscovites have responded to 
a single help-wanted ad in a newspaper seeking to fill 630 crew positions at 
the chain's first restaurant in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The McDonald's restaurant on Pushkin Square is scheduled to open Jan. 31. It 
will be the fast-food giant's largest operation, seating 700 people indoors and 
another 200 outside and is expected to serve more than 15,000 customers a day. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow-McDonald's, a joint venture of McDonald's Restaurants of Canada Ltd. and 
the Foodservice Administration of the Moscow City Council, plans to eventually 
open 20 restaurants in the Soviet Union.

<P>
A McDonald's spokesman said that so far, 550 crew members have been hired for 
the Moscow operation. The crew will begin training next month after an 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
The company said that in recent weeks, it conducted more than 3,100 interviews 
-- seven days a week, 10 hours a day at McDonald's Moscow office. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's said the applicants have varied backgrounds, ranging from housewives 
re-entering the work force or seeking their first job to students from Moscow

A TOUGH CHALLENGE IN 'MORNING';

Erik Sorenson recently became the second executive producer that "CBS This 
Morning" has had since its debut Nov. 30 two years ago. He has what some 
consider the morning version of "Mission Impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Like its previous incarnations, the two-hour program remains a distant third in 
ratings against NBC's "Today" and ABC's "Good Morning America." Like his 
predecessors on past and current CBS morning shows, Sorenson is expected to 
change that. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's impossible," says Sorenson, 33, a former vice president of 
KCBS-TV in Los Angeles. "I think it's tough, though." 
</P>
<P>
Recent Nielsens contained a ray of hope for the CBS reveille team of Harry 
Smith and Kathleen Sullivan. The ratings were up two-tenths of a point from 
those of the previous November. 
</P>
<P>
To improve on that, Sorenson, plans some changes: a different musical 
arrangement of the show's theme music; more ratings-boosting travel, and what 
he calls "more visual variety." 
</P>
<P>
He is also trying to get "name" contributors on various topics, among them 
Chicago-based movie critic Gene Siskel, best-known from the syndicated "Siskel 
&amp; Ebert" film review series. He has also hired two new full-time staffers, 
features reporter Wayne Freedman and, from KCBS, entertainment reporter Steve 
Kmetko. 
</P>
<P>
And, in a move that got his show some publicity last week, he hired CBS Sports 
reporter Greg Gumbel, the brother of "Today" co-host Bryant Gumbel, to do 
sports segments. 
</P>
<P>
But Sorenson doesn't think his show will get a swarm of disaffected "Today" 
viewers next month when Jane Pauley yields her co-host chair there to Deborah 
Norville. 
</P>
<P>
He theorizes that ABC's "Good Morning America" would be the chief beneficiary 
of any "Today" viewer defection simply because it has been on since 1975 and, 
like its NBC rival, is a place of relative stability. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Sullivan and Smith will continue as anchors all next year on "CBS This 
Morning," Sorenson immediately replied, "Yes."

JUDGE DENIES FREEDOM TO OBSESSED FAN

Freedom was denied to a mental patient described as a fan obsessed with Cher, 
Sheena Easton and Olivia Newton-John who also told police he killed his 
8-year-old stepbrother. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Nau, 34, was ordered Monday to remain at Elgin State Mental Health 
Hospital, where psychiatrists have diagnosed his condition as mentally ill and 
violent. He can reapply for release in two months. 
</P>
<P>
The man who led police to the shallow grave where the body of his stepbrother 
was buried reportedly suffers from delusions about fancied relationships with 
Hollywood stars. 
</P>
<P>
Letters written to celebrities that were intercepted by hospital personnel were 
introduced at the release hearing where Judge Philip DiMarzio declared Nau a 
danger to himself and others. 
</P>
<P>
Gavin de Becker, a Hollywood security consultant to the stars, said he is 
relieved by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Nau has never been convicted of a crime, though he admitted to police that he 
killed his mother's stepson, Denis Gerken, 8, with an ax on Aug. 8, 1984, near 
Antioch, in Lake County, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
He subsequently led police to the ax and to the shallow grave in a cornfield 
where the boy was buried. His confession was ruled inadmissible as evidence on 
the grounds that he was insane when he gave it. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's ruling was based on evidence from the 1984 killing, as well as 
psychiatric testimony and letters written by Nau to female movie and television 
stars that have been intercepted by mental health officials. 
</P>
<P>
Nau imagines that he has relationships with Newton-John, Cher, Easton and other 
Hollywood stars, mental health officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Employees of De Becker's Studio City agency kept tabs on Nau from 1981 until a 
few weeks before the killing, even secretly watching him at public appearances 
of Easton and Newton-John, the consultant said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tim O'Neil, the Kane County assistant state's attorney who has handled Nau's 
case since he was sent to Elgin, said that under state law Nau may file again 
for release in 60 days.

Americans are watching an average of almost seven hours of television a day, 
according to the Nielsen Report on Television 1989 released today. 
</P>
<P>
Women tune in more than men, situation comedies are the favorite viewing 
material and Sunday remains the most watched night of the week. 
</P>
<P>
The average number of hours viewed per day in the 1987-88 television season was 
six hours and 55 minutes, Nielsen reported, compared to seven hours and five 
minutes the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen also reported: 
</P>
<P>
*There are 90.4 million U.S. households that own at least one television set, 
double the number of households owning sets in 1960. Of these, 97% own color 
sets and 63% own two or more sets. 
</P>
<P>
*The average TV household can receive 27.7 channels. 
</P>
<P>
*Households that viewed television most were those with three or more people, 
those that subscribe to pay cable and those with non-adults. 
</P>
<P>
* After sitcoms, the most-watched programs were feature films, second, and 
general drama, third. Women made up the largest segment of the viewing audience 
in prime time as well as for network news. 
</P>
<P>
* The drop in viewer interest in presidential nominating conventions and 
Election Night coverage declined again in 1988, when combined viewing time was 
five hours and 48 minutes, compared to 14 hours and 12 minutes in 1976.

LIZ SMITH: 'DICK TRACY' BEATTY DOES A COP-OUT ON 'MISERY' 
</P>

CHANGES: Warren Beatty was supposed to do Rob Reiner's new movie, "Misery," but 
the star and director of the coming "Dick Tracy" has now backed out. He will be 
replaced by James Caan . . . and Kim Basinger was supposed to follow "Batman" 
with a movie for 20th Century Fox, a first independent project there by Leonard 
Goldberg, with screenplay by "Rainman" Oscar winner Ron Bass, to be directed by 
Joe Ruben. However, "Sleeping With The Enemy" is not to be for Kim it now 
seems, and Fox is negotiating with Julia ("Steel Magnolias") Roberts to take 
over the leading role.

THE UNITED NATIONS has often been criticized since its founding in 1945 as not 
being progressive enough, not taking enough stands on issues and, in general, 
being a fairly useless body of delegates. However, something exciting and long 
overdue may be happening soon at the United Nations. Rumor has it that Kenya's 
U.N. ambassador, Michael George Okeyo, is being groomed to take the top spot of 
secretary-general. If this happens, Okeyo would become the first ever black 
head of the world body. 
</P>

JODIE FOSTER is bringing considerable excitement to the office of Secretary of 
Labor Elizabeth Hanford Dole these days. Not that Dole's office isn't always a 
hotbed of important doings, but having an Oscar-winning actress on the premises 
does goose things up. Jodie is in Washington filming Orion's thriller, "Silence 
of the Lambs," wherein she plays an FBI recruit, tracking down a serial killer. 
Dole's inner sanctum was selected as the set for the office of the director of 
the FBI because of its dramatic, cinematic view overlooking the U.S. Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
This Jonathan Demme film also stars Anthony Hopkins as a psychopath aiding 
Jodie in her search for the killer. And Roger Corman, the veteran film director 
and producer of all those great Vincent Price horror films, will appear in 
"Silence of the Lambs" as the head of the FBI. (A scary thought for sure, 
though not nearly as scary as the director we actually had at the FBI for 
years.) 
</P>
<P>
"LBJ: The White House Years" by Harry Middleton, director of the LBJ Library, 
will be published this spring by Abrams to coincide with a series of gala 
"homecomings" and forums for LBJ intimates to take place in Washington, D.C., 
and Austin, Tex., in April, May and June. The book is a true insider's 
perspective of the LBJ Presidency. The cumulative effect of Middleton's 
incisive text and the hundreds of photographs, by chief presidential 
photographer Yoichi Okamoto, show how the White House functioned during LBJ's 
tumultuous era of war and radical social change. 
</P>
<P>
Middleton's positive approach is in contrast to Robert Caro's coming second 
volume on Johnson also due this spring. Caro takes a far more jaundiced view of 
the controversial President. Lady Bird Johnson's former press secretary, Liz 
Carpenter, says of Middleton, "He knew LBJ intimately, so it's an honest 
portrayal -- on all sides. His book is an insider's view."

SIMON McCORKINDALE, that terrific British actor, and James Brady, that terrific 
American journalist and author, have agreed on an option deal for Brady's 
elegant 1977 best seller, "Paris One." This was Brady's first novel, his baby, 
which has since been published in a dozen editions around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Actor McCorkindale sees "Paris One" as a four-hour television movie. I guess 
James must see it that way, too.

little girl because she had lice. Needless to say, this was terribly 
humiliating for my child. 
</P>
<P>
I took her to the doctor immediately, and he prescribed an anti-lice rinse 
called Nix. He said one treatment would be sufficient, and we wouldn't have to 
worry about combing nits out of her long curly hair. 
</P>
<P>
But when she went back to school, I got another call from the school nurse. She 
made me take my daughter home again, because she discovered nits. I tried to 
explain about the treatment we had used, but she insisted that no child could 
be allowed in school with nits. 
</P>
<P>
I spent hours trying to comb nits out of my girl's hair, while she sobbed that 
it hurt. Why wouldn't the school nurse believe the doctor that removing the 
nits wasn't necessary? And if this ever happens again is there any easier way 
to get the nits out? I refuse to cut her hair. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: If the school has a no-nit policy, the nurse probably had no choice, 
although there was no need for her to be insensitive to your daughter's 
feelings. The doctor was right when he said that any nits left after treatment 
with Nix Creme Rinse (permethrin) would die upon hatching and pose no danger to 
other children. 
</P>
<P>
When nit removal is required, however, you might want to consider a new product 
called Step 2 (GenDerm Corp.). It contains formic acid in a creme rinse that 
helps loosen the adhesive holding lice eggs on the hair shaft, making them a 
little easier to remove. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Every time I see my doctor and have my blood pressure taken, it is high. He 
wants me to take medicine, but when I measure my blood pressure at home with a 
digital machine, it is perfect. 
</P>
<P>
I know my machine is accurate because I had the doctor check it. But why would 
my blood pressure vary so much? 
</P>
<P>
A: You may be suffering "white-coat hypertension." That means your blood 
pressure goes up in the presence of your doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers are debating whether people like you need treatment. Many believe 
that blood pressure medicines are unnecessary in such a case and may pose a 
risk of side effects.

Three-time world boxing champion Jeff Fenech of Australia entered a hospital 
today to undergo hand surgery in an attempt to save his career, trainer Johnny 
Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
Fenech, unbeaten in 24 fights and the current World Boxing Council 
featherweight champion, has been troubled by painful hands throughout his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
He broke bones in both hands during a title defense against Marcos Villasana of 
Mexico in April and again injured his right hand last month when outpointing 
Mario Martinez of Mexico in a super-featherweight title elimination bout. 
</P>
<P>
Fenech, 25, hopes to fight for a fourth world title early next year. He 
previously held the International Boxing Federation bantamweight and WBC 
super-bantamweight titles. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said the operation would involve the lengthening and possible 
reconstruction of tendons in Fenech's right fist and would be performed by 
specialist Dr. Bruce Shepherd on Thursday.

WOMAN UMPIRE GIVEN HEAVE-HO AFTER SEVEN YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LITKE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pam Postema never wanted to be a cause, and now she won't be a big-league 
umpire either. Stalled at the threshold of Triple-A for seven tumultuous years, 
she has been handed her walking papers by baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I got my evaluation, and the only thing it said was that I ejected too many 
people," Postema said in a telephone interview Tuesday night from Phoenix, 
where she was back at her off-season job driving a UPS delivery truck. "That, 
and that my attitude went downhill at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too bad. I would have been good for the game. I have a lot of integrity 
and I wouldn't have embarrassed anybody, that's for sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I could understand it if they said I wasn't good enough, or I wasn't strong 
enough on the balls and strikes, or I couldn't handle the bases, or whatever. 
But this was just outrageous, and it tells me they've got to be reaching." 
</P>
<P>
Postema, 35, came into the business in 1978 as only the third woman umpire in 
professional baseball, and four years later became the first promoted past 
Double-A. 
</P>
<P>
She always insisted she cared not for pioneering the women's cause, but neither 
did she let her sex get in the way. Postema's tenure in the game was marked by 
many of the incidents common to members of the fraternity -- she was spat on, 
cursed at and had a collarbone broken because a young catcher mishandled a 
fastball -- and a few that were not. One night someone left a frying pan 
waiting for her at home plate, and she was occasionally the victim of sexual 
innuendo. 
</P>
<P>
But she kept her cool throughout. Her departure robs baseball of one of its 
more colorful and feisty arbiters and leaves 29-year-old Theresa Cox, who 
worked last year in the Arizona Rookie League, as the only woman umpire in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the game, I liked umpiring and I really thought it should be my life. 
That's why I stuck it out," Postema said. "And I still think I can do the job 
as well as anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm bitter right now and I don't want to brag, but if I couldn't make it, I 
don't see how any woman can." 
</P>
<P>
Postema's prospects for a ticket to the big leagues seemed strongest in the 
last two years, when she worked spring training games under the watchful eyes 
of Ed Vargo, a former umpire who is director of umpire supervision for the 
National League. 
</P>
<P>
Vargo declined comment when reached today at his New York office. 
</P>
<P>
Postema said she was informed that officials of both the National and American 
leagues decided during the recent winter meetings that she was judged 
unsuitable for the majors this season. 
</P>
<P>
Because it was the third straight year she fell into that category, she was 
given her release to make room at the Triple-A level for another prospect. Half 
a dozen other Triple-A umpires, all of them men, were similarly released in 
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"The job of minor-league umpire is in no way intended to be a career," said 
Randy Mobley, who heads the American Assn. circuit, in which Postema worked 144 
games last season. "It's a means to an end, the end of which is to become a 
major-league umpire." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Lawrence, director of the major leagues' Umpire Development Office, did not 
comment directly on Postema's situation. But when asked what his office looks 
for in a big-league umpire, he replied: "The No. 1 thing is handling 
situations" -- what the rest of us call arguments. 
</P>
<P>
"That deals directly with one's maturity," Lawrence said. "Very close behind 
that is consistency in calling balls and strikes, and handling the plays at the 
bases. Then technique, voice and so on. 
</P>
<P>
"But handling situations is at the top of the list, showing force without being 
arrogant," he concluded. "Because the umpire holds the ultimate weapon of 
rejection." 
</P>
<P>
Postema conceded that the news did not come out of the blue. And she was well 
aware that openings at the big-league level are few and far between because 
umpires no longer have a mandatory retirement age and those who have suffered 
the deprivations of the minors -- low pay, abusive ballplayers and demanding 
schedules -- are reluctant to step down once they've hit the comparatively 
plush big time. 
</P>
<P>
"I never regret anything I say or do, because at the moment, I really believe 
it," Postema said. "It's the way I've lived my life and always have. I endured 
a lot, but it was a great experience that I'd never want to take back."

SCHEMBECHLER TO QUIT AS COACH AFTER ROSE BOWL; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE WINNINGEST ACTIVE BIG-TIME COACH IS EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE 
HIS DECISION TO HIS WOLVERINE PLAYERS TODAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Bo Schembechler, big-time college football's winningest active coach, will step 
down for medical reasons after Michigan plays USC in the Rose Bowl, sources 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler, 60, will turn the Wolverines' program over to assistant Gary 
Moeller. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler will remain as Michigan's athletic director, a post that was added 
to his title in 1988 after Don Canham reached the mandatory retirement age of 
70, said the sources, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler was out of his office early today. He was to meet with his players 
in the afternoon. A news conference was scheduled for 5 p.m. EST. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler told a university sociology class Monday that he would never sit 
in the coach's office of the $12.5-million Center of Champions. The building, 
to be completed next autumn, will house the football program. 
</P>
<P>
He also told the students that Moeller would be the next coach. 
</P>
<P>
Heart attacks in 1970 and 1987 resulted in open-heart surgery, and 
Schembechler's physicians have urged him to slow down ever since. The decision 
was made easier because the Michigan football program is riding the crest of 
two consecutive Big Ten championships. 
</P>
<P>
It also was becoming necessary because Associate Athletic Director Jack 
Weidenbach, who has been in charge of daily operations of the department while 
Schembechler tended to football duties, is nearing retirement age. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Schembechler said he decided to make the announcement now 
because he wants prospective recruits to know who the coach will be. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler leads all coaches in NCAA Division I-A with a record of 234-64-8 
after 21 years at Michigan and six at Miami of Ohio. He is fifth on the 
all-time list and needs only four more victories to match his mentor at Ohio 
State, Woody Hayes. Schembechler is the winningest coach in Michigan history at 
194-47-5. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler never has had a losing season. Fifteen of his 21 Michigan teams 
have been ranked in the top 10 nationally. The 1985 team finished No. 2 after 
beating Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The only honor that has eluded Schembechler is the mythical national 
championship. The Wolverines began the 1989 season ranked No. 1 but lost their 
opening game to Notre Dame before reeling off 10 straight wins. They are ranked 
No. 3 and have only a slim chance of slipping past Colorado and Miami in the 
final Associated Press poll after the bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
"If you think that my career has been a failure because I have never won a 
national title, you have another think coming," Schembechler said a few days 
before beating Ohio State in the final regular-season game this season. "I have 
never played a game for the national title. Our goals always have been to win 
the Big Ten title and the Rose Bowl. If we do that, then we consider it a 
successful season." 
</P>
<P>
The New Year's Day game against USC will be Schembechler's 10th Rose Bowl and 
third in the last four years. The Wolverines (10-1) earned their second 
consecutive Big Ten title this season and 13th in Schembechler's career. 
</P>
<P>
Moeller, 48, has been an assistant to Schembechler for 18 years. He rejoined 
the Wolverines' staff in 1980 after three years as coach at Illinois, where he 
was released after compiling a 6-24-3 record.
