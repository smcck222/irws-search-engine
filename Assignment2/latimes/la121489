LITTLE BY LITTLE, A SMALL CITY SHOWS A BIG HEART IN ITS QUAKE RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Undaunted by the destruction that the Oct. 17 quake dealt it -- and with the 
help of some Southern California groups -- the small agricultural town of 
Watsonville is shaking off the dust and climbing to its feet. 
</P>
<P>
It has been rough for the 29,500 people of Watsonville -- one person was 
killed, about 80 were hospitalized and 195 homes were destroyed. But this 
working-class community includes some stout-hearted people. 
</P>
<P>
I should know. From the age of 5 until I left for college 13 years later, I 
attended school, shopped, went to Mass, worked and laughed with these people. 
Watsonville was my stomping ground. Even today, when Los Angeles gets me down 
and I feel the need to escape, I return to my hometown, where almost every 
street and face recalls warm memories. 
</P>
<P>
Watsonville -- a city known for its frozen-food processing plants -- is nestled 
between the hills of Mt. Madonna and the Pacific Ocean, about 16 miles south of 
Santa Cruz. Its population is about 50% Anglo, 40% Latino; the rest are Asians, 
blacks and American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
When I returned home a week after the 7.1 earthquake, I found that it had dealt 
Watsonville a tremendous blow. 
</P>
<P>
About 850 people, mostly poor Latino laborers, slept in tents that the city and 
the National Guard pitched in parks throughout the city. St. Patrick's Catholic 
Church, an enormous red-brick structure built in 1903, was heavily damaged, and 
church officials said it will ultimately be demolished. Some residents whose 
homes were severely damaged set up house in tents on their front yards and 
cooked meals on portable barbecue pits. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Latinos displaced by the quake had been living in aging apartments 
and run-down houses on the south side of town. Many of them had little to lose, 
but lost what little they had. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Ramirez, who was forced out of his two-room apartment, just shrugged as 
he watched two children run around in the mud in a vacant lot across the street 
where he and his family had pitched a tent for shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what God commands," he told me in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
But within weeks after the destructive quake, Watsonville began to show signs 
of recovery and -- in some cases -- the return of some normalcy. The number of 
people sleeping in tents in local parks and in three shelters began to 
diminish. 
</P>
<P>
Colleen McQuillan, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Watsonville, said the agency 
placed some people in hotel rooms until they could find other shelter. She said 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency also provided about 100 trailers that 
people could use on a semi-permanent basis. 
</P>
<P>
A group of Latino activists in Watsonville provided counseling for 
Spanish-speaking residents at a clinic called Salud Para La Gente, McQuillan 
said. Some of the people who sought help at the clinic lived through the 1985 
Mexico City earthquake and retained horrible memories of the experience, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been coordinating mental health workers to let people talk about their 
fears and anxiety," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a month after the quake, almost everybody had returned to work, she 
said, and school buses had been rerouted to include stops at the shelters and 
makeshift tent cities. 
</P>
<P>
What overwhelmed most people, she said, were the donations and gestures of 
support for those living in tents and shelters. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just amazing how many people were concerned about the kids in the 
shelter," McQuillan said. 
</P>
<P>
Among those making contributions to Watsonville's recovery were a group of 
music students from Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson, who raised money by 
selling cassette tapes of original music they recorded. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-song cassette, titled "Answering the Call," included funk, 
Christian-oriented and progressive rock music. Students at the university 
expected to raise about $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
One campus official said the university chose to assist Watsonville because 
"Dominguez Hills is one of the smaller campuses in the (Cal State) system, and 
we decided to adopt one of the smaller cities damaged by the quake." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) and some other Latinos helped 
collect about $1,000 in donations and filled a 60-foot-long truck with 
everything from pots and pans to blankets and baby food. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Malone, a spokesman for Polanco, said that "obviously there is a common 
heritage here" and added that the goal of the relief drive was for "Latinos to 
help Latinos." 
</P>
<P>
For many, the quake drew a heavy emotional toll. 
</P>
<P>
My dad -- a strawberry farmer who came to this country as a day laborer almost 
30 years ago -- said that many Mexican workers who were displaced by the quake 
had become frustrated trying to find a permanent house and returned to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
But he said tractors and other heavy equipment had begun the process of tearing 
down the most heavily damaged buildings in the city's downtown commercial strip 
-- much of which was built in the early 1900s -- to make way for their 
replacements. 
</P>
<P>
"Little by little," he said, "the city is getting better."

C. ALMARAZ, 48; CHICANO ARTIST OF URBAN SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carlos Almaraz, locally acclaimed Chicano artist praised for his murals and 
drawings of urban fantasies over the last two decades, has died of 
complications of AIDS, his lawyer announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Amy Nieman said Almaraz, 48, died in his sleep at 11:30 p.m. Monday at 
Sherman Oaks Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Almaraz, who preferred to be known as a Chicano rather than Hispanic or Latino, 
began his career as one of "Los Four," a quartet of friends from UC Irvine who 
painted with spray cans, combining the popular folk art of the East Los Angeles 
barrio with what they learned about art in college. His compatriots were Robert 
de la Rocha, Gilbert Lujan and Frank Romero. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Almaraz was known as "Charles" rather than the Latino "Carlos," 
but was the most openly political of the four and gained a reputation for his 
angry political iconography, campaigning for Latino grape workers' rights, and 
for fighting for the dignity of fellow Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of a 1974 exhibit of the group's work at Los Angeles County Museum 
of Art, Almaraz said he opposed quality or permanency in art and did not expect 
his -- done in spray or house paints -- to endure. 
</P>
<P>
"Using quality as a basis for art benefits museums, collectors and investors, 
not artists," he told The Times. "I now have $3 in my pocket borrowed from my 
grandmother. Too many artists arrive broke at their own opening." 
</P>
<P>
Questioned about his anti-Establishment, anti-material views, he said simply: 
"I love people more than art." 
</P>
<P>
Almaraz became more materially successful, however, perhaps in spite of 
himself, selling his works through galleries such as the Jan Turner Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
He regarded himself as less militant in recent years, but retained his wariness 
of institutions. During a Latino art exhibit at the county Museum of Art 
earlier this year, the first since that of "Los Four" in 1974, he told a Times 
interviewer: 
</P>
<P>
"They're not interested in Hispanic art. It's like the song, just 'Another 
op'nin' another show.' This is supposed to appease the peasants. People will be 
quiet for another 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Almaraz was one of nine Latino artists commissioned for the Los 
Angeles Bicentennial to paint for viewers at the Craft and Folk Art Museum. He 
depicted a mural of a mural on the side of the Hotel Figueroa with a blazing 
pile of junked cars leaning against a tilting city hall. 
</P>
<P>
Examining an exhibition of 30 Almaraz drawings in brilliant color at the 
Adrienne Simard Gallery in 1981, Times art critic Suzanne Muchnic observed that 
"his art has grown better over the years. . . . Tentative color fields and 
primitive drawing have meshed and developed into a personal style that is 
intensely expressive and self-assured. 
</P>
<P>
"Almaraz delivers messages of doom without making them seem immediately 
threatening," she said. "He accomplishes that by setting a dreamlike atmosphere 
and by using ingratiating color. Ghostlike figures arising from mad dogs, 
bloodless car crashes and cancer-causing TV sets are observed as if they belong 
to someone else's universe or to a nightmare that is, after all, only a dream." 
</P>
<P>
Almaraz is survived by his wife, Elsa Flores Almaraz; a 6-year-old daughter, 
Maya; his parents, Rudolph and Rose Almaraz, and a brother, Rudy Almaraz. 
</P>
<P>
Nieman said a private memorial service is planned. She said the family asks 
that donations be made in the artist's honor to Milagros AIDS Project, 741 S. 
Atlantic Blvd., Los Angeles, Calif., 90022.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN IS CONVICTED IN SLAYINGS OF 2 NEIGHBORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A woman was convicted Wednesday of second-degree murder in the fatal shootings 
of two neighbors, including a 6-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
Leeann Welch, 32, also was convicted of three counts of attempted murder. She 
faces a maximum state prison term of 48 years to life when she returns to court 
in Compton on Jan. 9 for sentencing. Her co-defendant and boyfriend, reputed 
gang member George Carter Jr., 30, is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 17 on 
first-degree murder charges. Carter is accused of being the gunman in the 
slayings. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Larry Walls said the fatal shootings occurred a day after 
Welch and her daughter became involved in an argument with members of the 
Salvador Saucedo family. The next day, April 17, 1988, Welch led Carter to the 
Saucedo home, which was sprayed with 22 rounds from an AK-47 assault rifle. 
Killed were Saucedo, 39, and his daughter, Irma, 6.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ALHAMBRA MAY EXEMPT BINGO FROM SMOKING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to a drop in attendance at bingo games sponsored by a local church 
and temple, the Alhambra City Council Monday night voted to consider exempting 
such games from the city's ban on smoking in public places. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for St. Therese Church and Temple Beth Torah said that shortly after 
the Alhambra smoking ban took effect in July, attendance at their fund-raising 
bingo games began tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed ordinance, bingo games conducted on private property and 
sponsored by religious groups or charitable organizations would qualify for the 
exemption. Also, bingo sponsors would have to install smoke reducers in the 
ceiling and provide smoke-filtering ashtrays. If the bingo room has more than 
40 players, at least 25% of the seats must be reserved for nonsmokers. A final 
vote on the exemption is scheduled Jan. 8.

<TEXT>
<P>
Southland motorists have been caught in traffic jams caused by spills of 
brassieres on the Santa Ana Freeway, a dead whale on the San Diego, currency on 
the Hollywood and a boat on Culver Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes a nightly distraction. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Dayton of Metro Traffic Control recently noticed that each night 
something seems to be hypnotizing east-bound Pomona Freeway drivers near 
Ontario and gumming up traffic all the way back to Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
The cause? A decorated house lit up like, well, a Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
Think of the legendary cruising spots in Southern California: Hollywood 
Boulevard, Whittier Boulevard in East L.A., Ventura Boulevard in the Valley 
and. . . . 
</P>
<P>
First and 2nd streets in Long Beach? 
</P>
<P>
Well, the residents of 1st and 2nd streets apparently think so, even though the 
affluent neighborhood seems to be crowded with cars only during the annual 
Fourth of July celebration nearby. Whatever, the locals persuaded the City 
Council to authorize signs that declare that "three times past same point 
within four hours is cruising." 
</P>
<P>
And two times past the same point within four hours is running an errand, which 
has not been outlawed even in this upscale part of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
And four times past the same point in one hour is being lost. 
</P>
<P>
Enforcement could require the creation of a new kind of cop: an officer 
standing on a corner watching all the cars go by. Don Jackson, are you filming 
this? 
</P>
<P>
And, now, eau de skunk: 
</P>
<P>
One of the newest items in UCLA's student store is Rapel, a vial of synthetic 
skunk juice that can be attached to clothing and punctured in the event of a 
sexual assault. The idea, as you might imagine, is that the attacker will be 
turned off by the resulting smell. 
</P>
<P>
Rapel, which costs $19.95, also comes with a vial of a substance that washes 
the skunk smell off the victim. 
</P>
<P>
Rapel distributor Victoria Barackman told the Daily Bruin that UCLA is the 
first university in the nation to carry the product (another first for L.A.!). 
</P>
<P>
Sales, however, have been slow -- eight packages in the first week. 
</P>
<P>
A bookstore worker blames peer pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Our recent piece on George Tirebiter, USC's famed canine mascot of the 1940s, 
mentioned that his origins were murky. 
</P>
<P>
USC grad Marlene Iverson of Rancho Palos Verdes has more details. 
</P>
<P>
"From 1936 to 1946 I lived in a house on the corner of 34th Street and Hoover, 
across from old Bovard Field," she writes. "Tirebiter's original name was 
Prince. His owner was a neighborhood kid called Bobo. Prince was a free spirit 
spending his days running up and down Hoover, chasing cars and biting tires." 
</P>
<P>
Iverson recollects that Prince's master was killed in an auto accident around 
1945. 
</P>
<P>
And so, the USC campus became the home for the animal that USC grad Douglas 
Hays fondly recalls as that "mangy, deranged, psychotic mutt." 
</P>
<P>
Thus completes the first chapter of "Tirebiter: The Early Years." 
</P>
<P>
In the heart of darkness: 
</P>
<P>
Mindy Berman, the after-hours spokesperson for the Department of Water and 
Power, briefed a Times reporter on Tuesday night's power outage that affected 
the Westside Pavilion as well as the apartments of about 500 Westside tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"That includes me," she added. 
</P>
<P>
The conscientious Berman kept working in her house, with the aid of a 
flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
Robert White, Norwalk's 6-foot-7, 290-pound city councilman, says, "I'm kinda 
country." So he had an earthy response Wednesday regarding a proposal for the 
city to spend $60,000 on a public relations firm to spruce up Norwalk's image: 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should be doing things in-house instead of out-house."

DOGS SEIZED DURING INVESTIGATION OF DULZURA DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department will consider seeking criminal charges if a 
preliminary investigation indicates that Roy Johnson, 69, of Dulzura, was 
fatally mauled by roving dogs, a spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's body was discovered in rural Dulzura about 9 a.m. Tuesday by an 
off-duty police officer who shot and killed one of two dogs that were "growling 
and baring their teeth" while circling Johnson's body, sheriff's spokesman John 
Tenwolde said. 
</P>
<P>
It was uncertain who owned the dogs. However, deputies subsequently seized four 
other dogs found at the nearby house of Charles Duarte, who later surrendered 
two more dogs, Tenwolde said. 
</P>
<P>
The Duarte family is "cooperating with investigators," Tenwolde said. 
</P>
<P>
The department will conduct a criminal investigation if it is determined that 
Johnson died as a result of an attack by dogs, Tenwolde said. "A lot of 
questions need to be asked before we can speculate about what the outcome is 
going to be." 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy was not yet completed Wednesday, but Johnson suffered "extensive 
injuries," Tenwolde said. A neighbor who saw the body described it as 
"unbelievable. . . . He appeared to have been eaten alive. That's the only way 
to describe it. He was eaten alive." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors were left "numb" in the wake of the apparent attack, said Carol Lane, 
a Dulzura resident. She said roaming dogs had not been a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was a "gentle man" who took care of pigs and horses at a ranch near 
where he was killed, said Charlotte Holcomb, 79, a longtime Dulzura resident. 
</P>
<P>
The dog wounded by the police officer is being treated by the San Diego County 
Animal Control Department. The department has locked up the six dogs collected 
from the Duarte property.

5 ARRESTED IN SHOPPING CENTER DRUG LAB RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's narcotics investigators arrested five men 
Wednesday and confiscated equipment and chemicals capable of producing about $2 
million worth of illegal methamphetamine, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators also seized three cars, three car phones and $2,200 in cash 
during searches at a Lancaster laboratory and a Chatsworth motel and a public 
storage facility, Sheriff's Sgt. Terry Judge said. Deputies discovered the lab 
at a Lancaster shopping center in the 2000 block of West Avenue J, after they 
noticed an open door while responding to a report of a suspicious person in the 
mall at 1 a.m., Judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested on suspicion of manufacturing a controlled substance were Nicholas 
Tombros, 23, of Simi Valley; Brandon Ricketts, 22, of Chatsworth; Walker 
Jonson, 22, of Sepulveda; Christopher Walsh, 24, of Northridge; and Robert Lee, 
22, of Chatsworth, Judge said. All were being held at the Sheriff's Antelope 
Valley Jail, he said.

L.A. BUS LINK TO ANTELOPE VALLEY GETS COUNTY OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A new commuter bus service from the Antelope Valley to downtown Los Angeles and 
the San Fernando Valley responds to the demands of commuters burdened by 
worsening traffic congestion and longer drive times, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale and Lancaster city officials said they hope the $1.2-million, one-year 
pilot program approved by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Tuesday 
bolsters efforts to encourage commuting alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major concern in our community," said Lancaster spokeswoman Nancy 
Walker. "One of the top issues is traffic, and that includes the Antelope 
Valley Freeway." 
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 of the valley's more than 200,000 residents work in the Los 
Angeles Basin, officials said. Rush-hour traffic snarls along the mountain 
route of the Antelope Valley Freeway and four-hour round trips have become 
commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
The program scheduled to begin in early January will offer two initial bus runs 
from Palmdale to the downtown Los Angeles business district, said Greg Kelley, 
transit manager for the county Public Works Department. It will cost $5 one 
way, with a monthly pass costing $145, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tentative morning departure times are 5:05 a.m. and 5:50 a.m., with arrivals 
downtown at 6:45 and 7:35 a.m. Buses traveling the afternoon routes will leave 
downtown at 4 and 5:05 p.m. and arrive in the Antelope Valley at 6:10 and 7:25 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley route will begin in February, Kelley said. It will 
probably exit the San Diego Freeway at Rinaldi and make stops on Sepulveda, Van 
Nuys and Ventura boulevards and Parthenia Street, said Ron Carter, vice 
president of Antelope Valley Bus, which is slated to provide the service. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando Valley fare will be $4.50 one-way, with a $135 monthly pass, 
Kelley said. Fares will pay for more than half of the $1.2-million program 
cost, with $450,000 coming out of state transportation funds. 
</P>
<P>
A "park-and-ride" lot at 6th Street East and Tri-Star Way near the Lockheed 
plant in Palmdale is the only designated departure point, with a Lancaster 
location still to be chosen, officials said. The number of runs may increase 
depending on the amount of ridership, Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
A county survey drew about 600 responses from interested commuters, Kelley 
said, and Carter said he received numerous calls Wednesday inquiring about the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale spokesman Steve Buffalo said the affordability of homes in the 
Antelope Valley has some residents driving to jobs in the South Bay, Long Beach 
and Orange County, which are grueling commutes of more than 100 miles in one 
direction. Car and van pools encouraged in Palmdale and Lancaster have 
increased over the past years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot program will show to what extent commuters are willing to leave their 
cars behind, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this new service is going to tell us a whole lot," Carter said.

KEY COALITION BACKS SUBWAY EXTENSION AT RAIL HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A formidable coalition of San Fernando Valley business and homeowner group 
leaders expressed support Wednesday for extending the Metro Rail subway from 
North Hollywood to the Sepulveda Basin instead of a controversial plan to build 
a cheaper but longer light-rail system to Warner Center. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the coalition, formed from groups that fought one another vigorously 
for three years before compromising six months ago, spoke at the first of two 
public hearings Wednesday on Valley rail options. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was conducted by the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, 
which is building a countywide network of rail lines and plans to select its 
next rail project as early as March. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of the hearing was a recently completed environmental impact report 
on 10 San Fernando Valley rail options -- each with a different combination of 
technology and track placement either above or below ground -- along two 
cross-Valley routes. 
</P>
<P>
The routes under study are the southern shoulder of the Ventura Freeway from 
Universal City to Warner Center, and a Southern Pacific rail right of way that 
crosses the Valley from North Hollywood to Warner Center parallel to Chandler 
and Victory boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
Both routes were studied as extensions of the downtown-to-North Hollywood Metro 
Rail subway and as light-rail lines at ground level, in a shallow trench or in 
a deep trench. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report studied the possibility of ending the rail line on both 
routes in the Sepulveda Basin, where travelers bound for the West Valley would 
transfer to buses. 
</P>
<P>
Rail planners and others had expected some desertions from the coalition after 
the environmental report found that the subway from North Hollywood to Encino 
would cost $1.3 billion, about twice what the commission will have available to 
spend during the coming decade on its next rail project. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, a bare-bones light-rail system from North Hollywood to Warner 
Center could be built for $1 billion, according to consultants who prepared the 
environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
The higher cost for the subway "means we may have to wait until after the turn 
of the century before the system is in operation," said Kurt Hunter, president 
of the North Hollywood Homeowners Assn. and a subway supporter. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said, that "doesn't mean we shouldn't build it. This is a system 
that will last 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
The Metro Rail extension to the Sepulveda Basin is the "most cost-effective 
alternative" of the 10 studied, said Gerald Curry, a Warner Center attorney 
representing the Woodland Hills Chamber of Commerce. "It's also the least 
disruptive to neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the heavy support for a subway, a majority of the 100 people attending 
Wednesday's hearing kept up the pressure on the commission, opposing any 
aboveground rail line in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
They cheered vigorously as speaker after speaker warned that an aboveground 
light-rail line would bring noise, ground vibrations and traffic congestion to 
single-family neighborhoods along both routes. 
</P>
<P>
Also represented at the hearing were homeowner group leaders from Van Nuys, 
Reseda and Encino who oppose any rail system, arguing that such lines cost too 
much, never meet ridership projections and are so expensive to operate that bus 
maintenance will suffer. 
</P>
<P>
Former U.S. Rep. Bobbi Fiedler contended that rail construction funds should be 
used instead to improve bus service. 
</P>
<P>
If any rail system is built in the Valley, she said, it should not be a costly 
east-west route but should be constructed along San Fernando Road in the 
low-income northeast Valley, "where we already know there are people who need 
and will support public transit." 
</P>
<P>
The commission will again take testimony on the report at 10:30 a.m. and at 1 
p.m. Sunday at North Hollywood High School, 5231 Colfax Ave.

EL SEGUNDO PLANS TO SUE L.A. OVER SEWAGE PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Segundo city officials said Wednesday they will file a lawsuit against the 
city of Los Angeles alleging that its sprawling Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant 
is a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
At a special meeting Tuesday night, City Council members voted unanimously to 
begin collecting affidavits from residents to back up the city's contention 
that the plant poses serious health and safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Los Angeles, under federal court order, is updating and 
expanding the plant. 
</P>
<P>
"We're proceeding to go to court, period," said Councilman Jim Clutter. 
"Frankly, we have gotten tired of trying to work with them." 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo officials said it could take 30 to 60 days to prepare the lawsuit. 
The only thing that would prevent their taking legal action would be if Los 
Angeles solves the odor, noise and other problems caused by Hyperion that have 
long plagued El Segundo residents, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are confident, from everything we know, this lawsuit can be successful and 
will be of benefit to citizens being touched by bad health and odor problems," 
El Segundo City Atty. Leland Dolley said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Councilman Scot Dannen: "David wouldn't be willing to go up against 
Goliath" unless he had thought he would win. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Engineer Robert Hori said some of the foul smells will 
disappear as the court-ordered expansion now under way at the plant continues. 
He said he did not know what effect a lawsuit would have on the expansion work. 
</P>
<P>
If a suit is filed, "I think our attorneys would have to look at it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Furuta, a Hyperion engineer who attended the Tuesday night meeting, 
acknowledged that there have been longstanding odor problems at the plant. 
However, he said, Hyperion officials have been trying to reduce them. 
</P>
<P>
For years El Segundo and Los Angeles have had a rocky relationship because of 
complaints from residents about the plant. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo homeowners living on the bluffs above the plant maintain that 
despite Hyperion's promises, the odors have actually grown worse. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, some homeowners on the bluffs alleged that their homes had been 
damaged by constant vibrations caused by construction crews operating 
bulldozers in the expansion project. More than 20 property owners subsequently 
filed claims against Hyperion. Los Angeles has settled at least seven of those 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
And last month, more than 200 residents took to the streets to protest 
Hyperion's proposal to build a row of 105-foot-tall sewage treatment tanks at 
the plant. The tanks, known as digesters, would block ocean views and breezes 
and drive down property values, the residents contend. 
</P>
<P>
Hori has emphasized that a final decision on whether to build the giant 
digesters has not been reached. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents who live near Hyperion were quick to support the lawsuit. "I 
think it's great. I think it's about time," said Sandi Teleso, who lives about 
500 feet from the plant. "We have been totally disregarded by the city of L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Hyperion officials, attempting to improve relations with residents, have rented 
an office in downtown El Segundo and hired an ombudsman to assist them in 
handling complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Besides authorizing collection of the affidavits, council members instructed 
the city's staff to meet with the Environmental Protection Agency to determine 
what changes can be made in Hyperion's construction to minimize the impact of 
the work on El Segundo residents.

HARBOR BOARD OKS CONCEPT OF SAN PEDRO OFFICE COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners took several important steps 
toward approving construction of an office complex on port-owned property in 
downtown San Pedro Wednesday, but nevertheless declined to give its full 
commitment to the project. 
</P>
<P>
By a 4-0 vote, the board accepted a conceptual master plan for the development, 
ordered an environmental impact study and authorized port officials to pay a 
consultant as much as $879,000 over the next three years to help oversee the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
But the board members -- particularly Commissioner Ronald Lushing -- made it 
clear Wednesday that they are not yet convinced the development should be built 
on the scale outlined in the master plan, which was drafted by yet another 
consultant who received $204,000 for the work. 
</P>
<P>
The plan envisions a heavily landscaped, two-block complex that would encompass 
the port's current headquarters, a new visitor center and a new 11-story office 
building that would be occupied jointly by port employees and tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The complex, which would force the abandonment of a portion of Palos Verdes 
Street, would be the last major project in San Pedro's downtown redevelopment 
area. The 200,000-square-foot office building would be roughly the same size as 
the Sheraton Hotel now under construction a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
Lushing, however, said he wanted more information on whether there is a market 
for that much additional office space in San Pedro. He successfully pressed the 
board to agree to review the scope of the project before an architect is hired 
to design it. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me," Lushing said, "that all of us need to decide, before it goes 
to an architect, what the project should be." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the meeting, Chief Harbor Engineer Vern Hall said the 
port staff intends to use the master plan as a guideline for the "maximum 
project" the port would build. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said the new consulting firm, URS Consultants Inc., will provide the port 
with architectural and engineering expertise. Although the port does have 
architects and engineers on its staff, Hall said they are unaccustomed to 
building commercial developments and in any case would not have the time to 
devote to the proposed office complex. 
</P>
<P>
He said the commissioners' decision to withhold final approval of the master 
plan should not affect the port's efforts to find an architect to design the 
project and that he expects an architect will be selected by next April. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioners' reluctance to give their full backing to the master plan was 
a disappointment for San Pedro's business leaders, who for years have been 
pushing the port to develop the vacant parcel across the street from Harbor 
Department headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
After the commissioners' vote, Leron Gubler, executive director of the San 
Pedro Peninsula Chamber of Commerce, said the business community's "gravest 
concern is that we get a commitment to this project." 
</P>
<P>
Gubler said the additional office space is essential to the rebirth of downtown 
San Pedro. He noted that some corporations have left the community for Long 
Beach because there was no place for them to expand. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is create a corporate climate here," Gubler said. "In 
order to do that, you've got to create a critical mass. We want to get enough 
business in here so that we don't lose business." 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the port office building have been kicking around since 1983, when 
the Harbor Department paid the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency $4.3 
million for 2.6 acres of property in the Beacon Street Redevelopment Area, an 
urban renewal effort launched by the CRA in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
The property, which fronts Harbor Boulevard, adjoins a parcel the port already 
owned. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the CRA and the port called for the Harbor Department to 
select a developer and submit basic plans for the parcel by Aug. 7, 1984. After 
numerous deadlines came and went, the port selected a Hollywood firm as a 
developer, only to ditch that company in August, 1988. At that time, the port 
declared it would build the office tower itself. 
</P>
<P>
The current timetable calls for construction to begin in the spring of 1992 and 
to be completed in the mid-1990s.

BURBANK TAKES STEP FOR GROWTH CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Burbank City Council has voted to adopt new design standards for apartment 
and condominium buildings despite protests from residents and developers. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 2 late Tuesday to tentatively approve the design 
standards recommended by the city Planning Department. Council members Mary Lou 
Howard and Tim Murphy cast the dissenting votes, saying the council should take 
more time to evaluate the proposed requirements. 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to take a final vote at its meeting next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Measure One, a controlled-growth ordinance passed by voters in February, calls 
for the council to establish design standards to force developers to reduce the 
size of large residential buildings and make them more compatible with their 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
But many residents complained that the proposed standards will not protect 
their single-family neighborhoods, which they say are besieged by traffic, 
pollution and noise from development. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not getting what we voted for," said Raymond Lambert, 62, a member of 
the Burbank Rancho Homeowners. "They're making this a developer's paradise." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the design standards include limiting the height of new apartment 
buildings to 23 feet if they adjoin single-family neighborhoods. The same 
buildings would have to be set back the same distance from the street as the 
adjacent houses; construction would be limited to 60% of a lot's area, and at 
least 25% of a lot would have to be landscaped. 
</P>
<P>
Lambert and several other members of the Burbank homeowners' group said the 
council should limit the number of building permits issued. They said the city 
also should tighten controls on commercial and industrial development, which 
are not addressed in Measure One. 
</P>
<P>
Some developers argued that the standards are too stringent and will cause 
rents to skyrocket and property values to drop. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Thomas E. Flavin, however, defended the design standards. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people who voted for Measure One wanted to put a stop to all 
residential development," Flavin said. "I think they wanted fewer projects and 
less density. I think these design standards are the first step in that 
process."

LITTLE LEAGUES PROTEST TRAVEL TO PLAY BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 15 Hawthorne parents and Little League coaches have criticized the city 
for a renovation project at Holly Park that has forced about 75 teen-agers on 
five teams to play on another field. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches and parents from the Holly Park Little League on West 120th Street 
said the project begun in October is replacing a regulation-size baseball 
diamond and two smaller softball fields crowded together at Holly Park with two 
upgraded softball diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling Jones, a Little League official, said 13- to 15-year-old players in 
the junior and senior divisions use a diamond that is 90 feet from home plate 
to first base. The new softball diamonds will be 60 feet from home to first. 
Younger Little Leaguers can play on the smaller fields. 
</P>
<P>
"Does the city of Hawthorne have any sensitivity to the youth?" asked Jones, 
who said the contractor doing the work estimated it would cost $3,780 to 
convert one of the softball diamonds to the size required for older Little 
Leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
Several parents said they now drive their teen-agers to Jim Thorpe Memorial 
Park, 14100 S.Prairie Ave. They also complained that some children get home 
after midnight because the Holly Park league games begin after the Jim Thorpe 
Little League games are completed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's fair," said Ella Parker, the mother of a player. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the two softball diamonds are being installed to 
accommodate a growing number of adult softball leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Steve Andersen on Monday asked that the Parks and Recreation 
Commission investigate the complaints and try to accommodate the Little League 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want you to get the wrong impression because we are with you," he 
said. Hugo Martin

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE DORN'S SUPPORTERS RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 60 community leaders and residents from throughout Los Angeles County 
vowed this week to organize a protest to return Los Angeles Superior Court 
Judge Roosevelt Dorn to Inglewood Juvenile Court. 
</P>
<P>
Dorn was transferred to the Criminal Courts in downtown Los Angeles by Superior 
Court Presiding Judge Richard Byrne amid allegations that Dorn was favoring 
certain court-appointed attorneys. Dorn has denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Among Dorn's supporters at a community meeting Monday night in Los Angeles were 
Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent, the Rev. Anthony Sanders of the Inglewood 
Police-Clergy Council and Warren Valdey, president of 100 Black Men of Los 
Angeles. Several parents said Dorn saved their children by intervening early 
before they committed crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Dorn has been both lauded and criticized for his use of a state law that allows 
parents to petition the court to take charge of their unruly children even 
though the children have broken no laws. Critics say he has put juveniles in 
custody for the most minor infractions.

Five arson fires, including one at a Catholic elementary school, were set early 
Wednesday in different parts of the San Fernando Valley, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported, and no evidence has been found to indicate that the 
fires are related, said Pat Marek, spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire 
Department. None of the fires appears to be related to a series of small 
rubbish and tree fires deliberately set in Reseda last week, Marek said. 
</P>
<P>
The first fire was reported about 12:39 a.m. Wednesday at a two-story Studio 
City office building in the 12000 block of Ventura Boulevard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several small fires had been set on the first and second floors. The fire, 
which caused more than $45,000 in damage, was put out in about 30 minutes, 
Marek said. 
</P>
<P>
A fire was reported about 1:20 a.m. in Panorama City at St. Genevieve's 
Elementary School in the 14000 block of Roscoe Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, put out in about 15 minutes, caused more than $13,000 damage, Marek 
said. Evidence was found indicating that the fire had been deliberately set, 
Marek said. 
</P>
<P>
A 3 a.m. brush fire in Woodland Hills blackened 10 acres before it was 
controlled by firefighters and three helicopters, Marek said. 
</P>
<P>
The brush fire near the 20800 block of West Mulholland Drive was extinguished 
in less than an hour, Marek said. 
</P>
<P>
Two small brush fires broke out about the same time in the Topanga Canyon area 
about a mile away, said Deputy Richard Edwards of the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The fires charred less than one acre near Topanga Canyon Boulevard and Summit 
to Summit Motorway and were quickly extinguished, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said no arrests have been made.

MOBIL HARVESTS GOOD WILL FROM TOURS AT REFINERY

<P>
With refinery officials calling it an unqualified success, a series of public 
tours of the Mobil Oil Corp. refinery ended Saturday in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people took the tours, which were run on four different 
Saturdays and one Sunday. The tours, originally set for only two Saturdays, 
were expanded to accommodate all the people who requested reservations, Mobil 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Word of mouth did have an effect, and people were calling up to ask when they 
could come, when we hadn't even mailed anything to their neighborhood yet," 
Mobil spokesman Barry Engelberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil eventually mailed tour invitations to every household in the city, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The tours were part of Mobil's campaign to show off the refinery's good side. 
In 1987 and 1988, the refinery suffered a series of accidents in which three 
workers were killed and more than a dozen seriously injured. The city has asked 
a court to give it additional powers to regulate the refinery, and in March 
residents will vote on whether to effectively ban hydrofluoric acid, a highly 
toxic chemical used at the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
About 420 attended the tour Saturday. Mobil officials said that, beyond the 
numbers, they were surprised at the level of interest among the visitors. Many 
participants would spend more than two hours looking at special exhibits after 
finishing their 45-minute bus tour around the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry S. McCreery, who has lived a few blocks from Mobil for the past 19 years, 
said he took the tour with his family Saturday to dispel their fears about 
occasional noises, smells and emissions coming from the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"I already felt there wasn't as much need for concern as everyone was saying," 
said McCreery, who works at a hazardous waste management firm. "There's so much 
hype about toxicity, and we wondered what Mobil was doing here." 
</P>
<P>
The participants toured the facility's maze of machinery and along the way were 
given Mobil's Frisbee-style disks, coasters and drinking containers and even 
Mobil-manufactured plastic bags in which to carry it all. About a dozen 
employees distributed literature and answered questions on refinery operations. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil spent about $25,000 to conduct the tours. Torrance officials rejected 
their original plan to stage a festive, $200,000 open house on a single 
weekend. The city refused to issue permits Mobil needed for temporary 
structures, electrical wiring and crowd control. City officials said they were 
worried about having as many as 12,000 visitors on refinery grounds. 
</P>
<P>
One woman said Saturday to Mobil officials that she went on the tour because 
she wanted to "hear what you had to say that the city didn't want me to hear." 
</P>
<P>
Engelberg said Mobil will continue to offer small, private tours for community 
groups.

FUR COATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everyone has a right to wear a fur coat. However, before purchasing that fur, 
everyone has an obligation to be fully informed of how a fur coat is made. I 
can assure you that after viewing, personally or by videotape (with sound 
intact), how one captures, raises and skins an animal, one would think twice 
about wearing a fur coat. After all, we are suppose to be intelligent beings. 
</P>
<P>
Let's keep the fur where it belongs-on the animals.

NAVY, GREENPEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article "Navy Foils Greenpeace Ship to Fire Trident 2" (Part A, Dec. 5) 
seems to mark a new era in the U.S. military. Since the Soviets are no longer 
"the enemy" and the armed forces are no longer sure whom they are training to 
fight, a new enemy must quickly appear. 
</P>
<P>
But your article scarcely mentioned why Greenpeace confronted the Navy 
submarine. Why indeed is the Defense Department committing scarce tax dollars 
to the Trident missile system, when the overwhelming majority of the American 
people do not support such pork-barrel waste of our resources? 
</P>
<P>
I commend the courage of the staff of Greenpeace for bringing to the attention 
of the American people that we must shift our understanding of military 
balance. As I see it, "the enemy" is now our own dangerously wasteful weapons 
programs and the excessive pollution and destruction of land and sea caused by 
the testing and deployment of unneeded nuclear and other weapons systems.

A STUDY IN PLEASANT SURPRISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nobody expects the bottom to fall out of U.S. defense spending. Cuts will come 
gradually. But even if Washington took a terrible swift sword to the Pentagon 
budget, Southern California would not be devastated. In fact, if some defense 
savings were invested in space projects, the region would be better off with 
less defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
These are among the pleasant surprises in a study of the consequences of an 
immediate one-third cut in defense funds, an extreme and unlikely scenario. The 
study, admittedly broad and of little use, say, to a defense engineer deciding 
whether to take on a bigger mortgage, was conducted by a team of researchers at 
the Southern California Assn. of Governments. Led by economist Gordon Palmer, 
the team analyzed defense activities in five counties -- Los Angeles, Orange, 
Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura. Other analysts have come to similar 
conclusions about San Diego County's ability to absorb defense cuts. 
</P>
<P>
The report was not specific on space projects, but many are lined up for 
funding. An Earth Observation System would monitor the planet's vital signs 
from orbit. Observatories would be built on the dark side of the moon for 
astrophysicists to take readings of outer space. A more distant project is a 
joint American-Soviet manned mission to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Short as it may be on practical advice to defense workers, the study does make 
a case that Southern California need not panic over peace. It also delivers 
timely warning that Southern California can no longer depend on luck and a nice 
climate that enabled it to survive earlier cuts in defense spending. California 
must make certain its job retraining and economic development programs are 
fully funded and ready to step in to help defense workers who need it. 
</P>
<P>
The study arbitrarily assumed cuts in defense from about $300 billion to about 
$200 billion and projected the effect on jobs by 1995. Its conclusion: The 
region could not create the 1.3 million new jobs that would exist if defense 
spending stayed level but would have to get by on 1.1 million new jobs by 1995. 
Further, there might be more than 1.3 million new jobs if some defense savings 
were shifted to space programs. That is scarcely doomsday data. 
</P>
<P>
The record of defense firms trying to transfer their high-tech talent to the 
commercial sector is not good. Rohr Industries tried and failed to build a 
better subway car. Boeing had a bad experience building urban people movers. 
But it can be done. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Rockwell International -- with Chairman Donald R. Beall 
calling signals -- has cut its dependence on Pentagon contracts from upwards of 
50% to just over 25% by diversifying into non-defense fields. When Rockwell's 
B-1 bomber contract ended, 18,500 workers lost jobs. Some were retrained for 
Rockwell's non-defense jobs. Some moved to other aerospace companies that had 
new defense contracts, a pattern of musical chairs in aerospace that would 
taper off, if not stop, with a smaller defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
But Rockwell also demonstrated that a shortage of engineers, which has 
concerned industry for years, can cushion them from unemployment as defense 
work winds down. Further, Beall argues, the country will need to turn its 
engineers and skilled workers loose on building and rebuilding highways, 
bridges, canals, harbors, schools and whatever else it takes to build and 
deliver the goods that America needs to compete in the new world economy. 
</P>
<P>
New symptoms of what the end of the Cold War will mean to Southern California 
appear almost daily. Tuesday Robert W. McNamara, defense secretary to 
Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, and Lawrence J. Korb, an 
assistant defense secretary during President Reagan's trillion-dollar Pentagon 
buildup, agreed that the United States could still strengthen its security with 
a defense budget half the size it is today. 
</P>
<P>
Barring setbacks that could result from breakdowns in Soviet and East European 
reform, considerations of world commerce will reclaim center stage from the 
Cold War and military economics. Consumer-oriented industry, competition and 
trade will dominate strategy just as missiles have for 40 years. Southern 
California will be an integral part of that change. 
</P>
<P>
The region cannot reject the chance of upheaval in transition. Sacramento and 
local governments must be prepared to help defense industries feel their way 
into a new future. But it must dwell less on the past and more on the challenge 
and opportunity of a future with Europe at peace.

SELF-SERVING SUPERVISORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisors are trying to settle a voting-rights lawsuit 
against them out of court. But the 3-2 vote in favor of the settlement reflects 
their bitter division over a proposed settlement that fails to satisfy anyone 
involved except the three men who voted for it to protect their political 
hides. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed by the U.S. Justice Department, which claims that 
supervisors violated the Voting Rights Act when they reapportioned their 
districts in 1981, deliberately dividing the county's large Latino population 
among three districts. The Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund 
and the American Civil Liberties Union later joined the case. Under the plan, 
more Latinos would be in Pete Schabarum's district, which already includes some 
heavily Latino cities in the eastern county. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Schabarum voted against the plan. So did Mike Antonovich, who 
fears the county may be forced to pay some of the attorneys' fees run up by 
MALDEF and ACLU -- something he should have thought of when the supervisors 
first began dragging their feet on a lost cause. The trio that approved the 
plan, Deane Dana, Ed Edelman and Kenneth Hahn, did so because they want to keep 
their secure districts and they don't like the often abrasive Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Latinos have been excluded from the board is a wrong that must be 
corrected. But when 8 million people are governed by a tiny clique of five 
politicians, no one is well-represented. 
</P>
<P>
So before approving the proposed settlement, U.S. Dist. Judge Robert V. Kenyon 
-- whose powers of persuasion have gotten the complex case this far along 
towards resolution -- should push the supervisors to consider alternatives, 
particularly expanding the board to seven or nine members. That would give them 
all a chance at political survival. More importantly, it would give all county 
voters a chance to elect a more representative board.

FOR WORLD OF THE '90S, A RETURN TO SQUARE ONE;

DEFENSE: THIS HISTORIC MOMENT SHOULD PROVIDE OUR IMPETUS TO DEVELOP FROM 
SCRATCH A PENTAGON BUDGET BASED ON EMERGING THREATS AND OPPORTUNITIES.

<P>
With the Soviet empire crumbling, we are probably witnessing as profound a 
change in the international system as that which occurred at the end of World 
War I, when the Soviet state was born, or at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Although the transition will be harder, since the Cold War has been one of the 
verities of our age, the obvious implication is that we should be approaching 
the questions of defense policy afresh. It is a time for zero-based defense 
budgeting, for rejecting premises that were the basis of policy for the past 40 
years and developing instead an entirely new budget and plans based on emerging 
threats and opportunities. Yet the Administration is considering adjustments of 
a few percent from current levels, arguing that we must be cautious about major 
changes in policy and programs because of a possible reversal of trends in the 
Soviet Union, and that we must maintain strength in order to negotiate 
effectively with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
The first argument demands serious consideration. One can envisage three 
trajectories for the Soviet world. A best case would have perestroika 
succeeding and the Soviet Union emerging as a major constructive force on the 
international scene. A worst case would have the Soviet empire disintegrating 
into a congeries of feuding, unstable states and ethnic groups. But the case of 
greatest concern to the Bush Administration is one of retrogression, in which 
the empire is held together under an authoritarian, xenophobic leadership that 
is committed to repression at home and dependent on military strength for 
influence abroad. 
</P>
<P>
We can discount the last vision. While there will surely be backsliding in the 
Soviet Union, significant retrogression can only contribute to instability and 
an increased likelihood of the triumph of chaos. Moreover, the immediate 
troublesome effects of a victory of Soviet conservative elements would likely 
be internal. In the world at large, the "correlation of forces" is now so 
overwhelmingly favorable to the West as to virtually preclude adventuristic 
expansionist or interventionist policy by any rational Soviet leadership. 
</P>
<P>
What of the Administration's other argument? One should always be suspicious of 
claims that new weapons programs are needed so that the United States can 
effectively negotiate arms control and disarmament pacts. Here one should ask 
what is most likely to lead to significant restraint or reductions in Soviet 
military efforts: bargaining from strength, or unilateral actions on our part 
that the Soviet leadership might see as offering them a plausible rationale for 
cutting programs judged redundant, irrelevant or too costly? 
</P>
<P>
In the current climate of uncertainty, zero-based budgeting ought not imply 
total disarmament. Considering the implausibility of the threats that have 
dominated national security planning since the 1950s -- a disarming attack 
against the United States and/or a large-scale attack against Western Europe -- 
we need reductions of 50% to 75% in force levels and budgets and great 
restraint with respect to most new programs. 
</P>
<P>
The case for "modernization" of our strategic nuclear forces can be dismissed. 
The possibility of a deliberate attack against us, already seemingly 
infinitesimal, is hardly likely to be reduced much by our acquisition of new 
systems, nor can one imagine how such weapons could contribute to reducing the 
likelihood of, or the damage from, local conflict arising from instability in 
and around the Soviet empire. 
</P>
<P>
In the same vein, we should not be asking what is needed to cope with an attack 
on Europe or prolonged worldwide conflict with Warsaw Pact forces, but rather 
what role conventional military force can play in peacekeeping and in coping 
with localized conflict that might threaten world peace and our interests. The 
implications are for substantial reductions at least in forces committed to 
NATO defense and to the maintenance of sea lines of communications. Considering 
that the Soviet Union is now turning inward, and that the determining factor in 
our sad experience in Southeast Asia was not inadequacy of military force, 
major reductions in force projection and interventionist capabilities are 
indicated as well. 
</P>
<P>
With the possible exception of providing more economic support for the 
reformers in Hungary and Poland -- and maybe soon elsewhere in the East -- it 
is hard to imagine opportunities for initiatives that would be more 
meaningfully responsive to the realities of the '90s than a truly radical 
rethinking of U.S. defense needs.

HONG KONG: THE FOCUS ON VIETNAMESE AVOIDS THE BIGGER PROBLEM OF HONG KONG 
RESIDENTS FLEEING THE CHINESE TAKEOVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

International Affairs in London and editor of The Pacific Review.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States and Britain are arguing about refugees, but the row is over 
the wrong refugees. Britain is determined to forcibly return about 40,000 
Vietnamese who fled to Hong Kong, while the United States wants Hong Kong to 
let the refugees stay if they will not agree to return home voluntarily. (On 
Tuesday, Britain suspended the forced repatriation for a week.) 
</P>
<P>
The British believe that the U.S. government, which treats Mexicans and 
Haitians in a similarly rough way, has little ground for such criticism. And by 
focusing on the Vietnamese, the United States avoids facing the far more 
complex problem of the likely flood of Hong Kong residents fleeing the colony 
as the 1997 Chinese takeover approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the massacre in Beijing's Tian An Men Square in June, Britain has 
quietly been trying to stir up support among allies for cooperative measures to 
ensure the stability of Hong Kong, or failing that, to cope with the expected 
surge of those seeking refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has raised the matter at the European and 
Commonwealth summit meetings and has sought American help on both a bilateral 
basis and as a member of the Industrialized Democracies. The consistent 
response, when stripped of its diplomatic drapery, is that "this is a problem 
of British colonialism and you had better sort it out yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Although London might expect such cynicism from many Europeans, not to mention 
other Commonwealth members who had to wring independence from Britain, it is 
the U.S. attitude that seems most shortsighted. If anything, because of its 
major investment in Hong Kong, the United States has an even greater stake in 
its stability and success and stands to gain the most from any plan to take in 
Hong Kong refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Bush Administration's overture to Beijing last weekend, many in 
Washington seem willing to stand tough against the repressive Chinese regime. 
For that reason, it is all the more surprising that Washington is not willing 
to take a leading role in providing an "insurance policy" for the people of 
Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Britain is looking for an international agreement whereby the developed world 
will pledge to take in Hong Kong residents who want to leave when the next 
crisis of confidence erupts. It is hoped that such a promise will not only help 
ensure China's good behavior, but will give the people of Hong Kong the 
confidence to stay at home and make the economy work. Even at current levels of 
emigration (mostly to Canada and Australia), Hong Kong will lose so many of its 
professionals that the economy will fail rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
The success of an insurance policy for Hong Kong residents is not merely a 
matter of immediately offering extra passports to the colony's 5.7 million 
residents. To do so now would turn the stream of professionals seeking a more 
secure life into a flood of people unwilling to wait for the next crisis. 
Unless the insurance policy is framed so that it can only be activated after a 
crisis has begun, it will only ensure the immediate collapse of Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is no exact model for such a complex arrangement. Similarly 
unique conditions faced the developed world in the late 1970s, when refugees 
flooding out of Vietnam overwhelmed the Southeast Asians who were the first 
port of call for the "boat people." As a result, the United States led an 
international effort in 1979 to hold a conference in Paris to arrange an 
orderly departure program that included a Vietnamese government agreement to 
regulate the flood of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Vietnam was a special case for the United States. But refugees from 
Hong Kong will also be special, for like the Jews escaping Nazi Germany in the 
1930s, these will be the most highly skilled and talented refugees in the 
world. As detailed studies in Canada and Australia show, they are only an 
economic burden for a short period and quickly become a boost to the local 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when the attention of most of the developed world is focused on the 
epochal events in Europe, it is not surprising that few are thinking about the 
fate of Hong Kong. But at a time when so many millions are breaking free of 
communist rule, it would be particularly deplorable if we let millions of 
others slip back under the control of the much nastier Chinese version of 
communism. 
</P>
<P>
There is still some hope that if the United States could join with Britain in 
arranging an international conference to make arrangements and pledge 
immigration quotas for Hong Kong, then confidence in the colony might be 
bolstered sufficiently to withstand the next crisis. It does not take a 
particularly talented crystal-ball gazer to see that when China heaves in 
political convulsions after the death of its leader Deng Xiaoping, Hong Kong 
will be severely rattled.

Then, if the worst happens and the Hong Kong economy shudders and collapses, 
the flood of boat people or jumbo-jet refugees would have someplace to go. 
Under such dire circumstances, the United States and the developed world will 
not have to deal with anything like 5.7 million refugees. But those they do 
take in will be the best "exports" that China could ever send.

CHILE AND LIBERTY RECONCILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The following is excerpted from an editorial in La Epoca, a major daily 
newspaper in Chile. The translation is by Times correspondent James F. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 A nightmare will soon be left behind. Long years in which we Chileans treated 
each other like enemies. Some of us were good, others were bad; some had truth 
and reason; others, lies and violence. Some had power, others asked for pity. 
Since the enemy had to be destroyed, he was jailed, he was tortured, he was 
humiliated, he was obliged to live in fear. He was exiled and banished and 
killed. To the shame of our history, and to the pain of so many millions, 
hatred prevailed over love for so long; unjustifiable events came to be nothing 
more than censored news. A profound scar runs through the soul of Chile. 
</P>
<P>
We Chileans will vote (today) so that we do not repeat the past two decades. So 
that dogmatism never again prevails over tolerance. So that the rights of man 
are as sacred as a mother's love. 
</P>
<P>
Things will be different in the future because the world has changed and we 
ourselves have changed. There is a piece of us in many nations of the world; 
there are those who left out of fear and do not return today because of their 
love for the land that welcomed them. But they will know, at least, after this 
vote they have awaited for 16 years, that they are wanted, that there is, once 
again, a political road that makes room for all Chileans. 
</P>
<P>
Every man of this land, every woman, the young and the old know how this 
election was brought about. They know that it flowed from a struggle for 
freedom by those who did not acknowledge past defeats. 
</P>
<P>
Chileans now want . . . accords that unite and put an end to the victories that 
divide. 
</P>
<P>
The pains of yesterday demand from politicians the talent to offer bridges and 
not the ability to raise walls. Chile wants to embrace the cause of concord. A 
very few want to practice violence; other fools want to prolong the oppression. 
They are the ones who fear peace, who invested in and profited by encouraging 
hatred. But all the rest will depend on this peace for everything from civil 
tranquility to the healthy march of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The changes in Chile coincide with what is happening in many parts of the 
world. Curtains, walls and barbed wire are falling. The symbols and the leaders 
of ideologies that frustrate liberties are falling. It is the end of a century 
in which anguish is being traded for hope. 
</P>
<P>
(Today) we will vote for liberty. A people will walk free who refused to break 
their chains by force, for love of the human being who was their jailer. They 
will ask the jailer not to look back, either. 
</P>
<P>
And after the vote will come the reconciliation of Chile.

PILOT PROGRAM TESTS FEASIBILITY OF RECYCLING SAN DIEGO'S ORGANIC WASTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pilot program testing the feasibility of converting organic waste such as 
leaves and tree clippings into mulch for use in city parks and along freeways 
will begin Friday in three San Diego communities. 
</P>
<P>
Called the Greenery Curbside Pick-up Program, the program affects 14,000 
households in Del Cerro, Grantville and San Carlos. Residents are being asked 
to participate in the program by separating their "green" waste from other 
waste and placing it on the curb for collection. 
</P>
<P>
City officials predict that 300 tons of mulch -- about 25 full trash trucks -- 
will be collected monthly during the pilot program. The communities normally 
use 125 trash trucks a month, said Ellyn Hae, the city's recycling coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
If the effort succeeds, it will be expanded citywide within the next four 
months, according to Marlene Mariani of the city's Waste Management Department. 
</P>
<P>
The city hopes to save landfill space by reusing the tree and shrub clippings, 
lawn cuttings and other organic material. These now compose 15% to 25% of San 
Diego's residential waste. The collected green waste will be converted into 
mulch by two tub grinders at the Miramar landfill just north of Kearny Mesa. 
The mulch will then be used in planted areas in parks, recreational areas and 
areas bordering freeways. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot project, the first of its kind in the county, will determine the 
level of participation that can be expected citywide and the tonnage that will 
be diverted from the landfill, said Mariani. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is very anxious to get some kind of recycling program in the 
community," Mariani said. "One of the things that this pilot project will do is 
give a fairly decent estimate of how much participation we can expect." 
</P>
<P>
The program, which has no definite ending date, will use existing garbage 
trucks and personnel for the pickups. City officials could not provide figures 
on the cost of the pilot project, saying those costs will be computed as the 
project continues and all costs are being absorbed into the existing budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We will compare the cost (of the program) versus the diversion rate from the 
landfill," Mariani said. "When you look at green materials making up 15% to 
25%, it's costing a lot in terms of capacity in the landfill." 
</P>
<P>
It is projected that the Miramar landfill, the city's only solid waste 
landfill, will be full by 1998, said Mariani. That's an improvement over the 
1995 projection issued a year and a half ago before the Waste Management 
Department was formed. 
</P>
<P>
The department's goal is to recycle 25% of the city's annually generated 1.3 
million tons of garbage by the year 1992 using the greenery collection and 
other recycling programs, and to push Miramar landfill's closing date back to 
the year 2005. 
</P>
<P>
The greenery collection program is similar to one started in Seattle early this 
year that has generated almost 11,000 tons of mulch. 
</P>
<P>
Mariani said the amount of greenery recycled will depend on the area and the 
time of year. She expects the time before the holidays to be slow, but said 
recycling should pick up once people begin to dispose of their Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
The city will continue the Christmas tree recycling program begun last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year the city collected about 45,000 (trees), and this year we hope to go 
above and beyond that to 50,000," said Mariani. 
</P>
<P>
The county's Solid Waste Department also will run a Christmas tree program. A 
hot line run by the organization I Love a Clean San Diego gives drop-off sites 
for the trees. The toll-free number is 1-800-237-2583. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the two programs plan to recycle as many as 100,000 dead trees, 
affecting all six of the county's landfills, which Mariani said are already at 
"crisis levels."

CLIPPERS SHUT DOWN THE PISTONS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: L.A. HOLDS ON FOR 83-79 VICTORY DESPITE MISSING SEVEN OF EIGHT 
FREE THROWS DOWN THE STRETCH.

<P>
The bad boys were wearing white. 
</P>
<P>
The home whites. The Clippers, picking up technical fouls quicker than 
victories of late, got two more in the third quarter Wednesday night against 
the Detroit Pistons, the supposed bullies of the basketball world who did 
manage a double technical of their own in the closing minute. 
</P>
<P>
By then, things had really turned upside down: The Clippers, who have four 
technicals in the last two games, not counting illegal defense calls, beat the 
defending NBA champions, 83-79, before 13,041 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't selective in our big wins here," Coach Don Casey said. "All our wins 
are big wins." 
</P>
<P>
This one didn't come easily. 
</P>
<P>
"We just came out and competed," Clipper forward Ken Norman said. "That's what 
we needed to do, forget all the damn excuses. We don't have an outside shooter. 
We didn't have all our players. Tonight, we proved we don't have to do anything 
to win but compete for 48 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Blue-collar, bad boy style. 
</P>
<P>
And, for a change, after losses in their last three close games, the Clippers 
claimed a victory. Not that they didn't help make it closer than necessary, 
missing seven of their last eight free throws down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Two attempts -- both misses by Ron Harper -- came when Detroit's Isiah Thomas 
was ejected on a double technical with 42.8 seconds left and the Pistons 
trailing by four after arguing with referee Don Vaden. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I played tonight, it wouldn't have mattered anyway," said Thomas, who 
made six of 22 attempts with three assists and three turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers (7-12) took the biggest lead of the fourth quarter, 82-77, on 
Harper's desperation three-point basket with 2:02 to play and the shot clock at 
two. That proved to be an insurmountable lead in an ending that lasted longer 
than some winning streaks. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like two weeks to me," said the Clippers' Danny Manning, who scored 
15 points to tie Harper, Gary Grant and Norman for the team high. 
</P>
<P>
No one, however, was complaining. 
</P>
<P>
"It can last an hour if we're going to win," Norman said of the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, the Clippers played at Portland and the Pistons were at Denver. 
The offenses, or at least the shooting touches, obviously didn't make the trip 
to Los Angeles, because it was nonstop non-offense the entire way. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the offensive slowdown came six years to the night the Pistons 
and Nuggets set the NBA record for the highest-scoring game, a 186-184 Detroit 
victory in triple overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, the Clippers (42.7% from the field) and Pistons (30.8%) couldn't 
even reach 186 together. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wednesday was a good day from the start for the Clippers. Norman 
returned after a two-game absence with tendinitis in his right knee and a sore 
right hand, and Charles Smith was back after one game out with sprained tendons 
in his big right toe. The team also gained an additional 10 minutes per game 
from Manning, who met with Dr. Stephen Lombardo and was upgraded to 30 minutes 
per contest. Another examination is set for next Wednesday, when the 
restrictions might be lifted completely. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news is they're back," Casey said of Norman and Smith. "The realistic 
news is that they're not 100% yet. That's what you have to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
Smith was in the opening lineup. But Norman, wearing a blue protective sleeve 
on the knee for at least a few games, was on the bench in favor of Manning. No 
matter. Both had significant contributions as the Clippers led for most of the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
Manning made five of his first eight shots en route to 12 points, the only 
player on either team to reach double figures by halftime. Norman scored eight, 
but the Clippers trailed at intermission, 38-37. 
</P>
<P>
They were ahead, 33-27, with 7:16 left before going cold. Points 34 and 35 
didn't come until Smith's layup with 2:56 remaining. By then, the Pistons 
trailed by a point. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been worse had Detroit shot better than 28% (seven of 25) in the 
second quarter, and 30% (15 of 50) for the half. 
</P>
<P>
The sluggish offense continued almost without relief. The Pistons (14-7) began 
play averaging 104.1 points a game, the Clippers 102.1, but neither reached 50 
until 6:04 remained in the third quarter. That gave Detroit a two-point lead, 
but the Clippers tied it again, 50-50, 19 seconds later on a layup by Smith. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the third quarter, the Clippers led, 61-57, thanks to a 6-1 surge 
in the final 1:44. Two of the Pistons' points in that period on the Clipper 
technicals, one when Manning slammed the ball to the ground in disgust of a 
non-call and the other when Ken Bannister yelled at officials from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter, the Clippers fell into a tie four times, but never 
trailed. 
</P>
<P>
So on a night when no one shot well and the Clippers missed what could have 
been crucial free throws, they did, more than anything, hold together. And when 
someone asked Casey afterward who stood out, his answer was quick in coming. 
</P>
<P>
"The team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Joe Wolf missed his third consecutive game with a sprained muscle in his lower 
back, but said he may return Saturday against Denver. . . . The Pistons had 12 
turnovers against the Clippers, who remain among the league's best at forcing 
turnovers.

NICHOLLS HAS A FULL DAY AS KINGS WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

HARTFORD, Conn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bernie Nicholls got four goals Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
He picked up one in the morning when he got up, one when he went down in the 
evening and two more to help power the Kings past the Hartford Whalers, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
Confused? It gets worse. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls' goals were spread over two countries, four days and 12 hours. He got 
two goals off his stick, one off his skates and one off a teammate, Wayne 
Gretzky, who quietly tied yet another league record Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Totally lost now? 
</P>
<P>
So apparently were the officials in Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
That's where Nicholls' weird tale began last Sunday. The Kings beat the 
Nordiques that day, with Nicholls slapping in a goal in the final second. 
</P>
<P>
But after reviewing a tape of the game, Quebec officials decided that the puck 
was deflected off the stick of Gretzky, who was standing by the net. So they 
took the goal away from Nicholls. 
</P>
<P>
But after a further review by NHL officials, Nicholls was given the goal back 
Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always nice," he said, "to wake up in the morning and have a goal." 
</P>
<P>
His second one, which came early Wednesday night at the Hartford Civic Center 
Coliseum, he could have easily done without. 
</P>
<P>
With the Kings ahead on Gretzky's first-period goal, his 14th, Whaler center 
Ron Francis brought the puck up the right side in the second period on the 
power play and fired it off goalie Kelly Hrudey. The puck rebounded and came to 
rest just outside the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls, trying to get it out, stepped on it. 
</P>
<P>
He went down as if he'd landed on a banana peel. And the puck went in. 
</P>
<P>
Francis, really just an innocent bystander on the play, got credit for his 14th 
goal at the 10:10 mark. 
</P>
<P>
"I just stuck my skate out," Nicholls said. "I don't think it would have 
counted if it had been at the other end." 
</P>
<P>
But down at the other end, Nicholls got two that did count, his 23rd and 24th 
of the season, temporarily moving him into the league lead. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls' first goal, a perfect slap shot from the left circle at 15:01 into 
the upper left-hand corner of the net on the goalie's glove side, gave the 
Kings a 2-1 second-period lead. 
</P>
<P>
But the Whalers, winners of four of their last five games and six in a row over 
the Kings in this building, came back to tie the game with 48 seconds to play 
in the period. 
</P>
<P>
Right winger Kevin Dineen, threading his way through King defenders, scored a 
short-handed goal, delighting the crowd of 13,932. 
</P>
<P>
Dineen raced down the ice on the right side, faked out Larry Robinson, cut 
left, losing Nicholls, then got past defenseman Steve Duchesne near the goal 
and flipped the puck in. 
</P>
<P>
"Too bad," Dineen said later in the locker room, "that it went for naught." But 
the goal didn't go unappreciated, even by the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
"Wasn't that a beauty?" said King Coach Tom Webster. "I stood up and cheered 
myself and I'm not supposed to do that." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings came back on the ice and took just four shots on goal in the final 
period, but connected on three of them to win comfortably, boosting their 
record to 16-12-3. 
</P>
<P>
Duchesne wristed in the first from the left post for his ninth goal at 3:20 on 
a pass from Steve Kasper. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls got the second at 9:09 on a slap shot from the blue line. 
</P>
<P>
And Luc Robitaille got the third at 15:32, to tie him with Nicholls at 24 
goals, on an easy 10-footer at the left post after a perfect pass from Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
"You know if you get open, he's going to get you the puck," Robitaille said of 
Gretzky. "He's the best in the world. He makes everybody's job easier." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's assist gave him at least one in 17 consecutive games. That ties an 
NHL record first set by Gretzky in the 1983-84 season and then equaled by his 
then-teammate at Edmonton, Paul Coffey, two seasons later. 
</P>
<P>
"If I get another one next game, great," Gretzky said. "If not, I'm tied with a 
good friend of mine. I'm not going to loose any sleep over it." 
</P>
<P>
Understandable. The greatest scorer in NHL history, he's already done 
everything in hockey. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not everything. 
</P>
<P>
He's never had a day quite like Bernie Nicholls had Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Two King right wingers left the game in the second period with injures. Mikko 
Makela, upended by Hartford's Adam Burt, suffered a bruised shoulder. The 
Kings' Dave Taylor was sidelined with a pulled groin muscle. . . . Kelly 
Hrudey, the Kings' goalie, faced 27 shots, stopping 25. The Kings took only 25 
shots against Whaler goalie Peter Sidorkiewicz . . . The NHL career of center 
Todd Elik lasted just one line shift. At least for now. Brought up from the 
Kings' American Hockey League farm club in New Haven Monday to replace the 
ailing Bernie Nicholls, the 23-year-old Elik made a brief appearance against 
the Montreal Canadiens. But Elik was sent back Wednesday after it was 
determined Nicholls would not miss any ice time . . . Nicholls has a bruised 
ankle, bruised knee and pain in the lower back. But Wayne Gretzky, his closest 
friend on the team, taped an aspirin to Nicholls' knee in practice and declared 
him fit.

LAKERS HAVE PLENTY LEFT TO ROUT HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

MIAMI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orlando Woolridge, at last, returned from his knee injury. Mychal Thompson sat 
out with a sore heel. Mark McNamara finally had a chance to shed his sweats and 
start at center. And, the more high-profile Laker starters were able to punch 
out early and relax for a change. 
</P>
<P>
That could only mean that the Lakers were facing the Miami Heat, not the NBA's 
worst team, but the one the Lakers have dominated like no other. 
</P>
<P>
After beating Miami by an average of 33 points last season, the Lakers hammered 
the Heat in their first meeting this season, 102-75, before a sellout crowd of 
15,008 Wednesday night at the Miami Arena. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers (16-5) had reason to feel good about the way they dominated and 
their intensity after playing four games in six nights. But more important to 
the team were the return of Woolridge after missing 20 games because of 
arthroscopic knee surgery, the loss for at least one night of Thompson and the 
inspired play of seldom-used McNamara. 
</P>
<P>
On the same day that Woolridge was activated, after having bone fragments 
surgically removed from his right knee on Oct. 17, Thompson was so badly 
hobbled by a recurrence of an old heel injury that he was forced to miss a game 
because of injury in two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers carried on, though. They did not need to be at full strength against 
the 5-17 Heat, which has few strengths even with a complete roster. The Lakers 
led by eight points at halftime, then finished off Miami in the second half. 
James Worthy led the Lakers with 21 points, and Magic Johnson had 18 points, 10 
rebounds and eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
But, as was the case in all four Laker meetings last season against Miami, this 
was a night for the less well-known Lakers to earn playing time and 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
It also gave Coach Pat Riley reason to contemplate how he will use his reserves 
when Woolridge, who had seven points, two rebounds and four fouls in 15 
minutes, works his way into condition and back into the substitution pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he probably will use nine players, one or two players more than in 
previous seasons. Riley said he wants to continue giving significant playing 
time to reserve center Vlade Divac, who had 12 points and seven rebounds 
Wednesday night, backup point guard Larry Drew as well as sixth man Michael 
Cooper and Woolridge. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can use all nine," Riley said. "One of the problems we've had in 
second halves is that we just don't have our legs. We've got some age out there 
now -- not exactly chronologically, but in terms of wear and tear -- and I'd 
love to develop a real solid second unit with Orlando, Vlade, Larry Drew and 
Coop or maybe Byron (Scott) as the shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to have it so we can go five or six minutes giving Buck (Magic 
Johnson) and James some rest. Rarely do you see this team without (both) Magic 
and James on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
This was one of those nights, mostly because the Heat succumbed so easily at 
the first sign of Laker dominance. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' big lead, which swelled to as many as 33 points in the fourth 
quarter, enabled Riley to play Woolridge liberally. Both Riley and Woolridge 
say it may be more than a week before he is back in game condition. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge, however, was encouraged by his effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the knee) felt great," Woolridge said. "Obviously, I don't have my game 
legs on yet. But the only way to get in shape is to keep playing. It'll come. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I fit in to this team the way I was last season. They need me for 
rebounding and defense and shot blocking. But I want to add some scoring this 
year. I'm looking to be more offensive-minded, going inside and strong to the 
basket." 
</P>
<P>
Even with Woolridge still a little tentative underneath and Thompson sitting 
out, the Lakers had a 48-32 rebounding edge and limited the Heat to 41.7% 
shooting. Except for Rony Seikaly, who had 15 points and 11 rebounds, the Heat 
mostly shot from the perimeter. As a result, the Heat attempted only nine free 
throws; the Lakers 24. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson played the second half of Tuesday night's victory in Charlotte with 
the bursitis in his left heel acting up. He limped noticeably in the fourth 
quarter of that game and did not suit up Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Though saying he feels constant pain, Thompson said he hopes to play Friday 
night, when theLakers meet the Celtics in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be out long, because I'll lose my game edge from playing," 
Thompson said. "You know, I'm so close to the Bahamas that maybe I'll ask Riley 
if I could stop by and step my heel in those therapeutic waters." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's absence left Riley with the choice of starting either Divac or 
McNamara. He chose McNamara because of Divac's penchant for early foul trouble 
and because starting Divac would disrupt the Lakers' substitution pattern. 
</P>
<P>
So McNamara it was. 
</P>
<P>
As the third-string center, McNamara had previously played only 22 minutes this 
season. Most of his time has been spent trying to stay in playing shape, 
helping Divac with low-post moves and learning Serbo-Croatian, Divac's native 
tongue. 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday, McNamara played 20 minutes. Though he made only three of nine 
shots and had eight points, McNamara had six rebounds and played well 
defensively against Seikaly. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be hard for Mark," Riley said of the center's limited playing time. 
"But he's handling it well. He understands the role." 
</P>
<P>
And, what is that role? 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody would rather play," McNamara said. "But I've tried to learn what you 
need to do to be a good third-string center. I have to stay in shape, be ready 
to play in case something like tonight happens. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I'm an insurance policy. (The Lakers) made that clear to me when 
they re-signed me. I have an ego, but it's one of my life's goals to be 
competitive and strive for goals without being egotistical. So, I can accept 
not playing. I like this situation." 
</P>
<P>
It definitely could be worse for McNamara. He could play for the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
To make room for Orlando Woolridge on the roster, the Lakers waived rookie 
forward Mike Higgins, who played only 18 minutes in six games. He scored one 
point and had one rebound. "Probably the biggest reason we let (Higgins) go was 
that he didn't have a position," Coach Pat Riley said. "He was a little small 
(6-foot-9, 220 pounds) for strictly being a power forward. I think Mel 
(McCants) is a truer player for that spot." 
</P>
<P>
Riley said Charlotte got the better of Wednesday's trade that sent former Laker 
Kurt Rambis from the Charlotte Hornets to the Phoenix Suns for forward Armon 
Gilliam. Rambis gives the Suns the rebounding power forward they had sought, 
while Gilliam is a physical, high-scoring forward who had feuded with Tom 
Chambers in Phoenix. "I don't know what (Gilliam's) practice habits are, but he 
can flat out play in the low post," Riley said. "That's a hell of a trade for 
Charlotte. But Rambis gives (the Suns) boards." . . . Former Laker Billy 
Thompson led the Heat with 17 points, mostly from outside. Rony Seikaly was the 
only other Miami player to reach double figures.

DORSEY OVERCOMES ADVERSITY AND REACHES 4-A FINAL AGAINST CARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It began in early September as a 49-team chase for the two City Section high 
school football championships and now, after 13 weeks of regular-season and 
playoff competition, four teams remain to play for titles in the 3-A and 4-A 
Divisions Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A title game, Carson (10-1) plays Dorsey (8-3) at El Camino College. 
And in the 3-A final, Franklin (12-1) plays Garfield (10-1-1) at East Los 
Angeles College. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, the defending 4-A champion, defeated Crenshaw last Friday, 58-7, 
advancing to its ninth consecutive title game. The Colts dropped Kevin Hicks, 
Crenshaw's standout tailback, for losses totaling 18 yards in his five carries. 
They scored three defensive touchdowns. Carson has outscored two playoff 
opponents, 89-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts were expected to be a finalist, but Dorsey has had a roller coaster 
season. The Dons were considered a strong contender to dethrone Carson for the 
City title but lost two of their first three games. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth game, against San Pedro, Kevin Copeland, Dorsey's best player, 
collapsed and died, apparently of an undetected heart problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons responded to adversity and won eight of their last nine games, losing 
only to Carson in that stretch, 19-8. 
</P>
<P>
In the playoffs, Dorsey defeated Reseda Cleveland, Palisades and Woodland Hills 
El Camino Real. In their 20-7 semifinal victory over El Camino Real, the Dons 
were led by defensive back Kenya Smith, who returned a punt 80 yards for a 
touchdown; and tailback Lamont Warren, who rushed for 163 yards in 19 carries, 
scoring twice. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey's offensive and defensive line play is a major reason the Dons will be 
making their first championship game appearance since 1982, when they defeated 
Locke for the 3-A title, 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
Key linemen on offense have been center Marlon Lewis, guard Ronald Lewis and 
sophomore tackle Cedric White, who have opened holes for running backs Warren 
and Larry Edmonds and quarterback Chris Cook. 
</P>
<P>
Warren, a speedy junior, has rushed for 1,170 yards and scored 20 touchdowns. 
He has caught 20 passes for 203 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Lamont is an outstanding player who has to do well for us to win," Dorsey 
Co-Coach Paul Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
On defense, Dorsey has outstanding linemen in seniors Demetrick Watts, Hosea 
Velasquez and John Blair. Senior Tamecus Peoples, who set a school record with 
11 sacks this season, is a standout at linebacker and Gregory Burns, Spencer 
Ray and Smith are solid in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
In Dorsey's regular-season loss to Carson, the Dons intercepted five of Armin 
Youngblood's passes and were inside Carson's 20-yard line four times but could 
score only six points. Crenshaw Co-Coach Robert Garrett, whose Cougars were 0-3 
against the two finalists, said that Dorsey will have to control the ball on 
offense to defeat Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"Carson is a quick-scoring team, one that can score from anywhere," Garrett 
said. "It is important for Dorsey's large offensive line to match up with 
Carson's quickness. Both teams' defenses are evenly matched, but Dorsey is more 
limited on offense than Carson. The less time Carson has the ball, the better 
off Dorsey will be." 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A final, Franklin is a familiar playoff team. The Panthers won the 3-A 
Division championship in 1986 and '87, and reached the semifinals last season. 
Franklin has a 43-5 record in the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
In the playoffs, the Panthers have beaten Huntington Park, Gardena and South 
Gate, the defending 3-A champion. In their 28-6 semifinal victory over South 
Gate, the Panthers handed the Rams their first loss in 25 games, with 
quarterback Santiago Alvarez throwing his 48th and 49th scoring passes of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin's opponent, Garfield, will be making its third championship game 
appearance of the 1980s. The Bulldogs won the 2-A Division title in 1982 and 
lost in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Garfield won the Eastern League title but was unseeded going into the playoffs, 
with Venice, South Gate, Westchester, San Pedro and Franklin rated higher. But 
once in the playoffs, the Bulldogs defeated Wilson, San Pedro and came from two 
touchdowns behind to defeat Locke, 40-14. 
</P>
<P>
With the 3-A final being held at East Los Angeles College, Garfield will be 
playing its seventh game of the season on that school's artificial turf. But 
Coach Steve Robinson downplays any advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not have any advantage when we play there because we don't practice 
there," Robinson said. "If we have any edge, it is psychological because to us, 
it is no big deal." 
</P>
<P>
One Garfield player who has excelled on the East Los Angeles College turf is 
junior running back Hilario Espinosa. He has rushed for 2,061 yards this season 
and, in two games against Locke this season at East Los Angeles College, he 
scored seven touchdowns and rushed for 482 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Two major prep boys' basketball tournaments began this week with many of the 
top teams in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The third annual Los Angeles am/pm tournament started Monday with the first 
half of the 32-team tournament playing at Los Angeles City College and Woodbury 
University in Burbank. City power Manual Arts, the defending champion, opened 
play this week along with Pasadena, last year's runner-up, and Dorsey and 
Washington. The final will be played Friday at Woodbury. 
</P>
<P>
Next Monday, the tournament's second bracket of 16 teams will begin play at 
Long Beach City College and Wilmington Banning High, with the final set for 
Dec. 22 at Long Beach. The top teams in that group include Pasadena Muir, 
Fremont, Santa Barbara, Compton Dominguez and Carson. The overall final will be 
Dec. 26 at the Forum before the Lakers' game against the Sacramento Kings. 
</P>
<P>
The 18th annual Tournament of Champions also began this week at Ocean View High 
School with 16 teams, among them Long Beach Poly, Los Angeles Loyola, Santa Ana 
Mater Dei, Capistrano Valley and Inglewood Morningside. The final will be 
played Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
A youth basketball coaching clinic will be held Saturday at Artesia High School 
from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. with several local college coaches scheduled to speak.

<P>
EVEN COACH SURPRISED AT NATIONAL VOLLEYBALL TITLE FOR CS BAKERSFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Rubio said that when he was named women's volleyball coach at Cal State 
Bakersfield three years ago, he was simply hoping to be competitive with 
national-caliber teams by this season. 
</P>
<P>
In his wildest dreams, Rubio admitted, he could have never envisioned that his 
team would win its first NCAA Division II championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Roadrunners won the title Saturday, beating top-ranked Cal State Sacramento 
in three consecutive games in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
"The year before I came here, the team had won only one game in conference, and 
when I got here I set myself a goal of wanting to compete for a national 
title," Rubio said. "But this, by far, surpasses all of those goals." 
</P>
<P>
The Roadrunners finished the regular season only 17-15 and in fourth place in 
the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The team didn't have the best record in postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield, ninth in the final Division II poll, had never advanced beyond the 
Division II regionals and had lost to UC Riverside in regional play the 
previous season. 
</P>
<P>
"All year long, from an athletic standpoint, I knew we had the talent to win," 
he said. "Even last year, after we lost to Riverside in the regional, I knew we 
had the talent to win the title. But we know that it takes more than athletes 
to win a title." 
</P>
<P>
Rubio said it did not disturb him when the team did not get off to a fast start 
in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a master plan at the start of the season," he said. "We knew that we 
had to be peaking at the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
But Bakersfield appeared to have peaked after dropping its final regular-season 
match to conference champion Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Rubio called a team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We had lost to Riverside and we just were not very competitive . . . and it 
was disappointing," he said. "The next day we knew we'd be in the playoffs and 
we had a team meeting and decided what direction we wanted to head. 
</P>
<P>
"We still knew we could win a national championship. We just went out after 
that meeting and it was very positive." 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield wasn't expected to last past its first match Dec. 1 against 
Northridge, a perennial Division II power. But the Roadrunners' prospects 
improved significantly when they were selected to play host to the regional 
playoff. 
</P>
<P>
"We had beaten them up here earlier in the season, and we felt like we could 
beat them (again)," Rubio said. 
</P>
<P>
Rubio, a former player and volunteer assistant coach at Northridge, watched his 
team defeat the Matadors in three games to advance to the Division II Elite 
Eight championship tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Bakersfield had the worst record of any team in the Division II 
playoffs, the school was chosen to the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"In the NCAA Division II, it doesn't matter what the school's record is," Rubio 
said. "It goes down to dollars and cents. Our choice was by far the most 
economical (for the NCAA) of any of the schools." 
</P>
<P>
He said playing at home was an important factor in the team's success. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the nice things about being the home team is you can go through your 
regular routine and prepare as you normally would for a home game," Rubio said. 
"When we played West Texas State (in the quarterfinals), we were very nervous 
before we started and our home crowd just lit us up." 
</P>
<P>
The Roadrunners defeated West Texas State and Florida Southern to advance to 
the championship against Cal State Sacramento. Sacramento, which went into the 
game with a 40-4 record, had defeated Bakersfield twice in the regular season, 
and Rubio said his team was eager to face the Hornets in the final. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield fell behind, 7-0, in the first game before taking control. The 
Roadrunners won in three games, 15-10, 15-1 and 15-13. 
</P>
<P>
The Roadrunners were led most of the season by middle blockers Valerie Cowan 
and Rachel Morton and setter Tami Jurgensen. But Rubio said it was probably the 
improvement of his three other starters -- left-side hitters Michelle Richard 
and Evelyn Sefuiva and right-side hitter Kim Fairchild -- that transformed the 
team into a Division II champion. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest surprise early in the women's basketball season has been 
the success of Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Under second-year coach Van Girard, the Toros have a 7-2 record. That's already 
more victories than they had all last season, when they finished 6-19. 
</P>
<P>
Girard had coached a winning program at Lynwood High before arriving at 
Dominguez Hills. He coached Lynwood to the Southern Section 4-A title in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
After watching the Toros struggle in his first season, Girard added five high 
school recruits to this season's squad. Five of the team's nine players are 
freshmen, and three of them are starters. 
</P>
<P>
Leading has been 6-1 center Yvonne Vanlandingham, who averages 12.7 points and 
8.5 rebounds. Other freshman starters are point guard Allison Krause and 
forward Denise Slater. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the only one-sided defeat was a 64-43 setback against West Texas State 
-- an NCAA Division II power -- in November. The team will be tested when it 
opens California Collegiate Athletic Assn. play Jan. 12 at Cal Poly Pomona, 
which has won or shared all eight conference titles. 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
An era ended at Cal Lutheran when longtime coach Bob Shoup was fired as 
football coach last week. Shoup, the school's only head coach, coached the 
Kingsmen for 28 years -- fourth longest among active college coaches -- and had 
a 185-88-6 record and 13 National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 
titles. He also coached the school to its only NAIA title in 1971. The team was 
3-7 this season and had not had a winning season since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The UC Riverside women's volleyball team, which won the California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. title and reached the NCAA Division II Elite Eight tournament 
last week, has put outside hitter Sheri Benson, middle blocker Jill Daniels and 
setter Regina Carbajal on the Division II All-American first team, selected by 
coaches. Middle blocker Kathleen Dixon of Cal State Northridge also made the 
first team, and middle blockers Valerie Cowan and Rachel Morton of Cal State 
Bakersfield were named to the second team. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive tackle Robert Morris of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo has been named a 
College Division I Kodak All-American by the American Football Coaches Assn. 
The 6-foot-5, 270-pound junior, a transfer from Boise State, had earlier been 
named Western Football Conference defensive player of the year . . . Paul 
Gabriel of Cal Poly Pomona, who was 114-91 in six years as coach of the women's 
volleyball team (16-18 this season), has resigned.

Integrated Resources Inc.: The financial services firm announced a 
second-quarter loss of $1.04 billion due to failing businesses and cheap asset 
sales in a bid to avoid bankruptcy. In the same period a year ago, the New York 
firm earned $12.8 million. Revenue in the current period totaled $70.6 million, 
down 38% from last year. The company said the loss exceeded a previously 
anticipated $600-million decline mainly because of substantially lower than 
expected proceeds from the sale of its core businesses to Los Angeles-based 
Broad Inc.

SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Average and median prices of existing San Diego area houses continued to level 
off in November, a sign that the overheated local housing market of earlier 
this year is cooling off. 
</P>
<P>
According to a survey of its members by the San Diego Board of Realtors, the 
average November price of a resold home in the San Diego metropolitan area was 
$209,467, a 9% increase from the $191,649 average price in November, 1988. 
Since April, however, when the record average price of $217,802 was set, the 
average price has essentially remained flat. 
</P>
<P>
The November median price, or price at which half of all existing homes sold 
for a higher price and half for less, was $178,500. Since April, median resale 
prices have fluctuated between $175,000 and $180,000. The San Diego board 
includes member brokers in San Diego, La Mesa, Chula Vista and El Cajon. 
</P>
<P>
The current interest rate on fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages is about 9.75%, said 
Rick McGill, residential lending manager at Great American Bank, down about a 
quarter percentage point from October. The drop has not sparked a discernible 
increase in loan demand however, he said.

PATENT DISPUTE IN KNIFE RIGHTS HAS A BITTER EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
They can skin a deer, cut through metal and safely shave off a man's beard. But 
the one thing these knives can't do is cut through layers of an acrimonious 
legal dispute between their El Cajon-based manufacturer, Buck Knives, and its 
former business partner, Phrobis Cos. of Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
The crux of the dispute is the patent rights to three hot-selling sporting 
knives that are manufactured by Buck. Those rights are the subject of two 
bitter lawsuits, a $19-million antitrust and patent suit filed by Phrobis 
against Buck and a $13-million suit filed by Buck alleging breach of contract 
and fraud by Phrobis. 
</P>
<P>
At stake is a significant portion of the $350-million domestic knife market, of 
which Buck, with $40 million in annual sales, is one of the nation's leaders. 
The knives, known as the XLTi titanium lockblade, the FieldMate sawback-edged 
knife and a commercial version of the Army's M9 Field Knife bayonet, are priced 
between $45 and $130. 
</P>
<P>
Phrobis, founded in 1982 by Charles (Mickey) Finn, does not manufacture knives 
or anything else, but conducts research and development on a variety of 
survival tools and weapons. Finn, a former delicatessen owner, has been a 
weapons consultant and adviser to the Navy, Army and other government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Phrobis' attorney, Robert Wrede, who filed the antitrust suit against Buck 
Knives in U.S. District Court in September, said the issue that the courts must 
decide is whether Buck was engaged in "a pattern of anti-competitive conduct 
that was designed to destroy Phrobis as a viable competitor." 
</P>
<P>
"What Buck did," he alleged, "was hold itself out as the source of all these 
inventive products. The real problem is they were usurping (Phrobis') 
reputation unto themselves for their own economic advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Buck, who 10 years ago became president of the company his grandfather 
started in 1945, flatly denied those charges. 
</P>
<P>
"There's absolutely no grounds for that argument," he said. "I would help 
(Phrobis) become a competitor. There's so much room out there that there's no 
reason to keep someone out of the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
When Charles Buck and Phrobis founder Finn entered into a business partnership 
in 1984, neither man foresaw the problems to come. Finn had an idea for an 
underwater knife that could be used by the Navy SEAL teams. Needing a way to 
manufacture it, Finn called Charles Buck, whose 450-employee plant in El Cajon 
is now capable of turning out 12,000 knives a day. Soon thereafter, the two men 
entered into the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The result of that initial business venture was BuckMaster, a 12 1/2-inch 
hollow-handled survival knife capable of cutting through wood, metal and ice, 
which sold for $160. The knife was an immediate success. About 50,000 
BuckMasters sold in 1985, the knife's first year on the market, thanks in part 
to the prominent role a similar survival knife played in Sylvester Stallone's 
popular Rambo movie "First Blood." 
</P>
<P>
The following year, Buck agreed to manufacture another knife designed by Finn, 
a super-strong folding knife with a 3 3/4-inch blade and a high-tech handle 
made of lightweight titanium. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't until their third and most lucrative deal, a $15.6-million 
contract to produce 315,600 12 1/4-inch bayonets for the Army, that the 
partnership between Buck and Finn began to fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
Finn's company, Phrobis III Ltd., had won a bid against five competitors to 
supply the Army with a modern multipurpose bayonet, and had chosen Buck as the 
subcontractor to manufacture it. But the partnership began to unravel after 
Charles Buck and Finn disagreed over the proper price for the bayonet. 
</P>
<P>
Buck officials now claim that Finn, in order to win a larger profit margin for 
himself, misled Buck into lowering its price as the manufacturing 
subcontractor. 
</P>
<P>
But Phrobis attorney Wrede alleged that Buck officials simply became greedy. 
After promising to make the knives at an agreed-upon price, he said, Buck 
demanded a higher payment, leaving Phrobis with no choice but to accept it or 
back out of its contract with the Army. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the growing dispute between Buck and Phrobis, the Army received all of 
its bayonets. Charles Buck claims, however, that Phrobis never paid for 15,600 
of the knives and thus owes his company $613,689. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 13, Phrobis filed a lawsuit against Buck, detailing more than a dozen 
complaints of its own dating back to the companies' earliest business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Among the complaints are allegations that Buck's FieldMate, XLTi and commercial 
M9 bayonet are all based on Phrobis designs in violation of Phrobis' patent 
rights. The lawsuit also claims that Buck delayed bringing Phrobis' knives to 
market in a timely manner, to make more money on its own knock-off versions of 
those knives. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking $19 million in damages, the Phrobis lawsuit also accuses Buck of fraud, 
economic duress, breach of contract, unfair competition, trade libel, 
monopolizing the knife market and interfering with Phrobis' business 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Buck responded to the charges by filing an 84-page counter-complaint against 
Phrobis declaring Phrobis' patent rights invalid and unenforceable. The 
FieldMate, which Phrobis claims is a knock-off of its own BuckMaster, "is 
nothing like the Buckmaster," Buck's attorney, Alexandra Mahaney, said. The 
licensing agreements on the other knives, she added, are invalid. The 
$13-million countersuit -- comprising $3 million in compensatory damages and 
$10 million in punitive damages -- also accuses Phrobis of breach of contract, 
fraud, intentional misrepresentation and antitrust violations. 
</P>
<P>
Both lawsuits face several months of discovery proceedings. No trial date has 
been set.

AIRLINE FAILS TO TAKE OFF FROM PALOMAR; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: PAN AM COMMUTER SPUTTERS, FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION 
WITHOUT EVER FLYING FROM NORTH COUNTY TO LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A small airline that won approval from the San Diego County Board of 
Supervisors last August to provide commuter flights between Palomar Airport in 
Carlsbad and Los Angeles International Airport has entered bankruptcy 
proceedings before service could begin. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County-based Resort Commuter Airlines, which contracted with Pan 
American World Airways and used the name Pan Am Commuter, was expected to offer 
up to six non-stop flights a day and trade upon North County's growing commuter 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Service was to begin on Sept. 25, but Palomar Airport Manager Rick Severson 
said Wednesday that Pan Am Commuter didn't pay its $750-a-month rent and failed 
to arrive with staff or equipment despite frequent promises. 
</P>
<P>
"From September until mid-November, they kept saying they'd start next week or 
next month," Severson said. "They never flew one flight out of here." 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors awarded the firm a two-year permit Aug. 22 to run the 
40-minute flights from Palomar, but Severson said the airline never paid its 
bill. The airline was very weak financially and went bankrupt, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy filing was confirmed Wednesday by Bill Crilly, vice president of 
operations for the airline. "The company, Resort Commuter, filed Chapter 11 on 
Nov. 17. There is no immediate plan to start service from Carlsbad," Crilly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Crilly said the company is seeking financial backing to rekindle the service, 
but so far nothing promising has developed. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement months ago about commuter service drew considerable interest. 
"Our telephones were ringing at a rate of 10 to 20 calls a day. There are a lot 
of people out there who want a commuter service," Severson recalled. 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, the only such flights available between San Diego County and 
Los Angeles originate from Lindbergh Field near downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Severson said space remains at Palomar for a commuter service, but "we have 
nobody interested now in pursuing it." He said Pan Am Commuter's demise marks 
the seventh time since the airport opened in 1960 that a proposed commuter 
service has failed to materialize or an existing commuter operation has gone 
out of business. 
</P>
<P>
The latest failure is especially disappointing, he said, because North County 
growth has finally provided enough commuters to support such a service. 
</P>
<P>
However, the fate of Pan Am Commuter isn't mourned by everybody, especially 
Barbara Donovan, a member of the Palomar Airport Committee and a former member 
of the Carlsbad City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan said Wednesday that she was "shocked" to learn about the bankruptcy but 
elated that residents near Palomar Airport will be spared what she had 
predicted would be increased noise and air traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of problems with noise generating from the airport. I thought 
Pan Am would be opening the door" to more air operations at Palomar, Donovan 
said. Last June, she was on the losing side of a 6-4 airport committee vote 
that recommended approval of the Pan Am Commuter permit to county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Donovan said she also suspected that Pan Am Commuter mechanics would disturb 
airport neighbors by revving airplane engines during routine maintenance. "It 
is a loud, protracted sound. It is most annoying," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Donovan acknowledges that there are many potential air commuters in 
North County, she believes the area must be protected, even if it means 
traveling to Lindbergh Field for flights. "There probably is a need, but we 
don't have to be all things to all people. If people need to go to L.A., let 
them go to San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
But commuter service from Palomar has supporters who insist that strict 
operating conditions would minimize noise or disruption. 
</P>
<P>
Severson said that, under Pan Am Commuter's now-canceled permit, flights would 
have been limited to between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., quieter turbo-prop planes with 
no more than 30 seats would have been used, and special routes would have been 
flown to avoid residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am World Airways officials did not return a phone call Wednesday, so it 
could not be immediately learned how the bankruptcy has affected the company's 
relationship with the commuter airline.

SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES

<P>
 Brunswick Corp. said Wednesday it plans to sell its San Diego-based Advanced 
Materials Technology Center, a unit of its defense division that is involved in 
the development of so-called Stealth aviation technology. 
</P>
<P>
Brunswick's AMTC facility employs 40 people in a 30,000-square-foot plant in 
the Miramar Road area, general manager Ray Buttram said. The unit is being sold 
because the development of its technology requires an investment that is not 
"compatible" with the company's other businesses, Buttram said. 
</P>
<P>
Based in Skokie, Ill., Brunswick is best-known as a manufacturer of pleasure 
boats and marine engines. The company's other San Diego operation, called 
BioTechnetics, is researching therapeutic and commercial applications of 
monoclonal antibodies.

JACK SMITH: THE LITTLE CHAMPION SPEAKS AND EVERYONE LISTENS

<P>
Dreams of self-fulfillment, and the determination to realize them, are not dead 
in our children. 
</P>
<P>
I was reassured of this the other morning as one of five judges of a 
competition among 20 fourth-grade pupils who gave brief speeches on the 
subject, "Hold Onto Your Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
The competition took place in a large meeting room of the Radisson Hotel in 
City of Commerce. It was full of parents and teachers. Most of the children 
were 9 years old. Each had won a competition in his or her own school. A box 
had been placed on the podium for the children to stand on, so that their heads 
and shoulders would show above the lectern. Some almost didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
Half the 20 pupils competing were from 10 schools in the Santa Ana Unified 
School District, half from the "Los Angeles 10" -- the 10 schools in the Los 
Angeles City School District with the lowest test scores. We were to select 
three winners. 
</P>
<P>
The judging system was complex. We had to grade each pupil 1-5 in various 
categories (diction, control of body, gestures), then add the totals. My fellow 
judges were actress Julie Carmen; Yolanda Miro, hostess of "Tu Musica"; Dr. 
Samuel Mark, director, Office of Civic and Community Relations, USC; and actor 
Carlos Palomino, former world welterweight boxing champion. 
</P>
<P>
I had expected a painful morning. I was astonished at the poise, language and 
persuasive skill of every child. My ear was tuned for grammatical errors; I 
didn't catch one. Most U.S. senators couldn't have done as well. 
</P>
<P>
Almost without exception the children never faltered in their presentations. 
Most knew them by heart. One or two used prompt cards. Most kept unwavering eye 
contact with the audience. Their voices betrayed no nervousness. Hardly any 
fell into singsong. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously they had been well-rehearsed by devoted teachers. Even their gestures 
appeared on cue. Rarely did one grope for words. I had no doubt that their 
teachers had helped them with their grammar, but that's what teachers are for. 
In the audience, I suspected, those teachers held their breath. Finally, we 
judges turned in our papers for tabulating. In the interim, radio star Jay 
Thomas passed out certificates to the teachers. Ronald McDonald, the clown, 
entertained. Julie Carmen's 3-year-old son wandered onto the stage. McDonald 
asked if he was in the Cub Scouts. Yes, the boy said. "How long have you been 
in the Cub Scouts?" 
</P>
<P>
The lad thought it over. "Uh . . . uh . . . a long time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After lunch the winners were announced. Omar Paez of Martin Luther King Jr. won 
first prize. Amanda Fults of Wilson won second; three girls, Nykia Smith of 
McKinley Avenue, Paula Armstead of 97th Street, and Patricia Tyler of 96th 
Street, tied for third. McDonald's Operators Assn. of Southern California, the 
sponsor, awarded $1,000 to Omar, $500 to Amanda, and $250 each to Nykia, Paula 
and Patricia. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech Omar said he wanted to be a "medical engineer scientist" so he 
could make people well; Amanda said she wanted to be "an astronaut, like Neil 
Armstrong and Sally Ride; I want to explore space." Nykia said she wanted to be 
an actress and a teacher. Paula said she wanted to be a lawyer, then marry a 
doctor and have her first child. Patricia also wanted to be a lawyer and to 
"bring about a crime-free world." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward I obtained a copy of Omar's speech. It read, in part: "I want to be a 
medical enginear because I have understude that a medical enginear scientest 
descovers new antedotes for diferent decises. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
I was relieved. So the kids were human after all. 
</P>
<P>
At the end, Minerva Perez of KTLA, emcee of the contest, gave Omar a hand up to 
the box on the podium and invited him to say a few words. His head barely 
showed above the lectern. He might have been the shortest person in the 
contest, but I had been impressed by his jaunty carriage and aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
He looked at the audience. Suddenly he lost his poise. He said, "I don't know 
what to say." 
</P>
<P>
His face contorted. Perez helped him down. Behind the lectern the tears came. 
But in a minute he was back on the podium, facing the audience. 
</P>
<P>
What the heck, Omar, it's nothing to be ashamed of. I'll bet Carlos Palomino, 
the former champ, has cried. 
</P>
<P>
So have I.

Hotelier's new home: Single occupancy, three meals, no balcony. Only $26 a day. 
That would be the average cost to taxpayers for each day Leona Helmsley could 
spend in Danbury Prison Camp in Connecticut. Helmsley is free on bail pending 
an appeal of her August conviction. Danbury is reportedly like a college 
campus, with no fences and unlocked rooms.

Long Story: Even when Louisiana's colorful Gov. Earl Long was cavorting with 
stripper Blaze Starr, he came home at night, his widow says. Blanche Long, 87, 
discussed Long's romps (re-created by Paul Newman and Lolita Davidovich in the 
movie "Blaze") with the press. "He was down there on Bourbon Street a lot, (but 
he) would be right at home that night. You know how men do that sort of thing, 
don't you?" Historians agree Starr was not the love of Long's life, because he 
also saw other women at the time. "What with the drugs he was taking, the 
liquor and the cigarettes, he was almost impotent, and that's why he was 
grabbing these young women," said historian Morgan Peoples.

Jackpot: Col. Jack Waters of the Salvation Army announced that because his

Foods, have read about the First Lady's donation and decided to give Waters a 
$100,000 check.

AND 'AFTER THE WALL,' WHAT OF SOCIALISM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was delighted to read the extremely incisive, well-written "After the Wall" 
(Dec. 6). It did an excellent job of addressing a question that various family 
members and I have been batting around for several weeks, namely how Marxist 
professors are reacting to the worldwide celebration of communism's collapse in 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
My cousin, a philosophy professor in Orange County, reports that his extreme 
leftist colleagues are basically laying low and maintaining a conspicuous 
silence.

'BABY BOOMERS' NEXT STEP' ELICITS MIXED RESPONSES

Linda Roach Monroe's article gives a good description of what women in their 
40s have to look forward to. 
</P>
<P>
I wish that Monroe had done more investigating into the hormone replacement 
therapy available to menopausal women. The source of estrogen, which the 
pharmaceutical community calls "natural," is pregnant mares' urine. While this 
is fine for horses, it does very little for human females. 
</P>
<P>
I am one of these unlucky women who was placed on replacement estrogen as a 
result of a hysterectomy. This surgery, which turned out to be without basis, 
has ruined my life forever. My gynecologist did not tell me that some women 
cannot tolerate hormone replacement therapy. In any dosage, I experience 
hypertension, edema, nausea, rapid heartbeat and lethargy. I never had these 
symptoms before. 
</P>
<P>
In the Monroe article, it states that, "Fortunately, estrogen replacement 
therapy can relieve many problems associated with these forms of early 
menopause. . . ." I'm afraid that this does not apply to post-hysterectomy 
patients.

Some Freaks by David Mamet (Viking: $16.95; 182 pages). 
</P>
<P>
Admire David Mamet and you'll get your head bitten off, or at the very least, a 
cigar in the face. 
</P>
<P>
There he is on the book jacket, glowering from his car window, half his face in 
shadow. If you are a cop who'd stopped him for a broken tail-light, you'd 
return to the cruiser and radio for back-up. If you are his wife, you'd take 
the garbage out yourself, and make sure not to walk between him and the TV set. 
</P>
<P>
Such, more or less, is the image suggested in this assorted collection of 
articles, addresses, musings and rumbles. Mamet is virtually a poet of the 
theater, drawing a musical sweet haplessness out of his sharpies and dummies. 
He doesn't thank you to say so. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a card-carrying member of the ACLU and the NRA and I never signed up to 
be sensitive," he writes in a piece about playing poker with the boys. 
</P>
<P>
Attending a convention of counterinsurgency groupies sponsored by Soldier of 
Fortune magazine, he frets that his Oxford shirt and blue jeans will mark him 
as "another wussy Eastern intellectual with a marvelous gift for dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
He takes part wholeheartedly, shooting off a pistol and entering the pugil 
stick contest. He knocks his first opponent into the swimming pool, and is 
knocked over by the second, though not before overpowering him in the 
preliminary ritual scream. 
</P>
<P>
"Lovely people," he writes of the conventioneers, even if he doesn't agree with 
some of their ideas. "But then I don't agree with some of my own ideas and seem 
powerless to rid myself of them." And he adds that they "seemed to love the 
idea of America in much the same way that someone else might love the idea of 
the Theater -- that is, as a perfect institution." 
</P>
<P>
By rights, that last half-phrase would qualify as sensitive, and maybe 
brilliant. But Mamet, one of our authentic theater artists, may have made his 
bed but he will not be caught dead lying in it. In these assorted pieces, he 
hacks away at any hint of enshrinement. 
</P>
<P>
He tells the Signet Society at Harvard -- he must have jumped at the chance to 
perform the lion in a den of sensitive Daniels -- that if he became an artist 
it was not mainly because of talent or message. Perhaps it was "to accommodate 
and embrace a deviant personality which was not going to be employed 
elsewhere." If you're a left-handed plumber, in other words, you do left-handed 
pipe-bends. 
</P>
<P>
It can be as tedious for an artist to flaunt his hairy chest as his hair shirt. 
Mamet's art, in any case, does not principally lie in writing such occasional 
pieces as are collected here in "Some Freaks." Many are as rough in workmanship 
as in message; there is a lot of sounding off and putting the feet up. It makes 
the feet feel good, but readers aren't feet. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from eight or nine pieces too slight or ephemeral to survive collecting, 
Mamet usually has something worthwhile, or arresting, or bruising to say. He is 
witty and idiosyncratic for part of the trip. The trick is to get off in time. 
The stop after idiosyncrasy is sententiousness. 
</P>
<P>
Mamet's notes on being a first-time film director -- "House of Games" -- nicely 
distinguish those things a director can do from those he should submit to. 
Sometimes, a general's job is simply to be seen on his white horse. Mamet 
writes of stepping ceremonially up to the viewfinder for each shot -- at this 
stage, the real responsibility belongs to the cinematographer -- and 
ostentatiously reversing the bill on his cap. 
</P>
<P>
Discussing acting for TV, he advises the performer to do little. The script 
will furnish the characterization, he writes. Acting technique should aim "to 
render the actor sufficiently uninflected to allow the audience to accept him 
in a multiplicity of roles." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the pieces denounce what Mamet sees as the tendency of American Jews to 
downplay their Jewishness. Reform Judaism, in particular, he calls "religion in 
a plain brown wrapper, the selling point of which was that it would not 
embarrass us." 
</P>
<P>
He argues that American Jews are dedicated to speaking up for civil rights and 
social equality for all minority groups except their own. Young Jewish women of 
his generation, he writes, flocked to enroll in Black Studies programs. And 
their friends and families, he adds, "supported them in their support of Black 
self-love at the same time we supported them in surgically recarving their 
faces so that they would look less 'Jewish.' " 
</P>
<P>
There is a brutal wit here -- it sounds like Jackie Mason -- but it seems a 
partial view, to say the least, and considering the backlash among Jewish 
voters to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, partly outdated. 
</P>
<P>
It is also hard to know what he means when he laments that Jewish houses look 
like Yankee houses and have no visual identity. What would a specifically 
Jewish house look like? What, for that matter, would a specifically Catholic 
house look like? If you want to be fundamental about it: like tents, both of 
them.

MISS MANNERS: A REASON FOR REVENGE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- For several months I wooed an attractive young lady. I had 
not won her, however (nor had we had one of those annoying, awkward, modern 
"little talks"), when I began to sense a distinct chill. After a few 
inconclusive weeks, I reluctantly decided to stop calling her. Unfortunately, 
but not surprisingly, she stopped calling me as well. 
</P>
<P>
Within a week, both intuition and hard evidence began piling up, revealing that 
she was making a serious play for my brand-new roommate. He seems quite 
receptive, too. 
</P>
<P>
I run into her about once a week, and I have to live with him. I'm pretending 
nothing has happened, but this is unsatisfactory. What would be a more 
appropriate response -- a fit of outraged bellowing or some more devious 
revenge? 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Miss Manners regrets to inform you that you are responding 
correctly. That knowledge should gratify you, but she realizes that it would be 
infinitely more satisfactory if she told you to rig paper bags full of water to 
fall over them on the sofa, and to write nasty remarks about them on the 
neighborhood walls. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that one does not retain an option on former romantic partners. 
Unpleasant as it is to see another more favored than you, and at close hand, 
nothing they have done merits your being unpleasant. Pretending you don't care 
is the only polite stance. 
</P>
<P>
This does not preclude dignified revenge. Most love affairs come to an end if 
you wait long enough, and there may be some satisfaction for you in observing 
this. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- What do you say to people who tell you what they want you 
to get them for Christmas, when you have no intention of getting them anything? 
</P>
<P>
My sister-in-law has been doing this. My husband and his sister have never 
exchanged gifts for any occasion. Suddenly this year she has started telling me 
things like, "You could get me this or that for Christmas -- I know y'all can 
afford it." 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Your sister-in-law wants to change that policy, but perhaps 
you had better make sure she isn't thinking of just changing half of it. 
</P>
<P>
You could say "Oh, do you think we should start exchanging presents?" or "You 
know, we've never exchanged presents, so you ought to be telling that to Santa 
Claus, not me."

YOUR WHEELS: DON'T DRAIN BRAKE FLUID ROUTINELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I recently read that it is advisable to change brake fluid every year 
or 30,000 miles. The reason is that apparently water can accumulate in the 
fluid over time and affect the safety of the brakes. Do you agree? -- E.L.S. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It is true that brake fluid has an affinity for water and readily 
absorbs it. Unlike many fluids in your car's mechanical system, brake fluid is 
not a mineral oil. It is a polyglycol, a synthetic material broadly related to 
the alcohol family, and mixes well with water. 
</P>
<P>
Brake fluid performs the important job of transmitting the braking force from 
your brake pedal inside the car to the brakes at the wheels. Under tremendous 
pressure, the fluid is forced through small tubes to the wheels, where the 
fluid actuates tiny pistons that push the brake pads and shoes against rotors 
and drums. The resulting friction stops the car. 
</P>
<P>
Water contamination of brake fluid causes two problems. First, it can cause 
spongy brake action, in which the pedal does not seem to reach a firm stop. 
This is the result of water and air compressing inside the fluid lines, which 
does not occur with brake fluid. It also results from the water boiling, which 
can occur because brake temperatures can reach 1,000 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The other problem caused by contamination of brake fluid is that the water 
corrodes the internal parts of the hydraulic system. Most often, the brake 
master cylinder and wheel cylinders or calipers can become internally corroded. 
That causes both internal and external leaks, which will eventually deplete the 
system of fluid or cause loss of hydraulic pressure, a very serious safety 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
For all the problems that contaminated brake fluid can cause, however, many car 
manufacturers do not list changing of brake fluid in owners' manuals as 
required maintenance. In some cases, the service is recommended as optional in 
the technical shop manuals used by garage mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with changing brake fluid as a routine service is that it is 
becoming a much more involved and complicated procedure on newer brake systems, 
and if it is not done properly, it will cause a lot of other problems. 
</P>
<P>
Product Test 
</P>
<P>
One of the most common complaints about cars from readers involves engine ping 
-- that annoying knock from under the hood when the engine doesn't seem 
satisfied with the octane rating of the gasoline you have purchased. 
</P>
<P>
I recently wrote a column about a new product produced by Chevron and called 
Pro-care Clean-up. Its main ingredient is Techron, a proprietary substance that 
is supposed to remove engine deposits, reduce the octane requirements of an 
engine and relieve ping. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a product test, I circulated bottles of Clean-up among a variety of 
motorists with older cars and asked for their opinion of the product. It was 
mostly favorable, with many people saying it seemed to reduce engine knock. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of a 1982 Honda Accord with more than 100,000 miles on his car 
reported that ping was noticeably reduced after treatment with Clean-up. But 
another Honda owner who has a Civic said it did not do anything for his car. 
</P>
<P>
The product improved the performance of a 1982 Volvo (with 100,000 miles on it) 
that has needed premium fuel for the last several years. "I noticed some 
improvement in performance, particularly acceleration, after using Pro-care. 
Also, hesitant starts were reduced," the owner said. 
</P>
<P>
A 1980 Subaru owner reported that her car "knocked and pinged something awful." 
After a one-tankful treatment, the problem was reduced somewhat, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of a 1974 MGB with severe engine ping reported that his car was 
helped initially, but that after a couple of tankfuls of gasoline without the 
treatment the clatter had come back, though not as badly as before.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: POSSIBLE TO HEAR DURING SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Recently, I underwent surgery in our local hospital, and 
later I told my husband that I recalled the doctors and anesthesiologists 
discussing the scores of a ballgame while I was under the knife. My husband, 
who is a doctor, laughed at this and told me I couldn't possibly remember 
anything. Could I have just imagined this? -- C.J. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR C.J.: Of course it's possible that you may have imagined it, or you may 
have heard this conversation before you were fully anesthetized. It's also 
possible, however, that some part of your brain recorded such a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
New studies have given credence to the idea that patients who are completely 
anesthetized can still register some of what goes on around them. This is 
significant information because it indicates that patients may comprehend 
enough of what is said during surgery to affect the course of their recovery. 
They may respond to positive comments and negative comments may upset patients 
long after surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The ability of patients to learn under anesthetic was revealed in a study by 
researchers at Cambridge University where patients were given information about 
a number of odd facts and later when questioned on the topics scored 
significantly higher than would be expected. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My 22-year-old daughter has an annoying, alarming habit of 
buying out department stores. We're not poor, but if she continues to use her 
credit cards with such abandon, we soon will be. What really irritates me is 
that she buys things she doesn't need or use. My late wife told me about the 
joys of buying, but why buy what you don't need? I've talked with my daughter 
about this. She agrees with me, but she doesn't change. What's wrong? -- P.W. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR P.W.: Some people use shopping as a way to escape from their problems. If 
they're depressed, they rush to a department store and buy a new dress, new 
shoes or new coat. Such purchases are usually unrelated to need -- at least, 
not the need of clothing. They are closely related to emotional needs. This 
kind of misuse of shopping is dangerous because this can quickly develop into 
an addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Buying something -- anything -- becomes a quick fix in much the same way a shot 
of drugs is a fix for a junkie, or placing a bet relieves anxiety for a 
compulsive gambler. Whether the addiction is to food, drugs, alcohol or 
shopping, the relief it gives is only temporary and does nothing to solve the 
real problem. 
</P>
<P>
Addicts typically suffer from loneliness, a feeling of emptiness and a low 
sense of self-esteem. I suspect that your daughter would profit from some 
professional counseling.

'GLORY' AN EPIC OF WANTING PROPORTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Glory" (at the Cineplex Odeon Century City) is an eloquent, heart-tugging 
Civil War epic about the first black infantry regiment to march off to battle 
for the Union. And epic is the word. Not since John Ford has a film maker 
created such dramatic large-scale Civil War battle scenes in a major theatrical 
film. 
</P>
<P>
However, without its fresh focus on the role of the black soldiers in the Civil 
War, "Glory" would seem old-fashioned in its unabashedly sentimental conflict 
between good and evil. What makes it as rousing as it is is our awareness that 
the Civil War was far from a decisive victory for blacks; it was more like the 
first round in a struggle for freedom and equality that continues more than a 
century later. 
</P>
<P>
"Glory," which is a touch self-congratulatory, eschews the ironic for the 
heroic, even though much of what it depicts is inherently, even cruelly ironic, 
especially in the spectacle of men who, among their first acts as free men, 
volunteered to pay for their freedom with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
Written with fervor by Kevin Jarre from various sources and directed 
passionately by "thirtysomething" co-creator Edward Zwick, "Glory" proceeds 
confidently in straight-ahead fashion with some astute observations along the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew Broderick stars as an actual Boston Brahmin abolitionist, Col. Robert 
Gould Shaw who, though wet behind the ears, doesn't flinch when he is asked to 
lead the 600-man 54th Massachusetts Voluntary Infantry, the first black Civil 
War unit. Broderick gives a flawless performance as this quintessential 
Victorian idealist, a prim, diminutive man with a Van Dyke beard, who has to 
dig into himself to find the reserves of courage and leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick shows us Shaw's growth, his learning how to temper his reflexive 
severity as he gains self-confidence. Keeping him in perspective is his less 
serious, less focused -- but no less decent -- friend, Maj. Cabot Forbes, 
played by a very likable Cary Elwes. 
</P>
<P>
The film makers wisely devote the first of the film's two hours to the 
regiment's training in a camp in Massachusetts. As the irate Shaw finds he must 
combat racism that delays uniforms, rifles and even shoes for his black 
soldiers, we learn to know a group of them. They are: Trip (Denzel Washington), 
a bitter, cynical young field hand from Tennessee; Rawlins (Morgan Freeman), a 
quiet, older man, a natural leader and peace-keeper; Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy), a 
sweet-natured, sharp-shooting innocent from South Carolina; and Thomas Searles 
(Andre Braugher), a Boston intellectual and freed man who is best friends with 
Shaw and Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
Shaping the men up is their Irish sergeant-major (John Flinn) who insists, not 
quite convincingly, that he is tough on blacks not because he is a racist but 
because he wants them to have a chance at surviving. There are unbilled 
appearances by Jane Alexander as Shaw's mother, the recipient of many of his 
letters, and Raymond St. Jacques, a dignified Frederick Douglass. 
</P>
<P>
These actors, starting with Washington and Freeman, are distinctive and 
involving. Braugher's Searles, however, is one of the film's primary strengths, 
as he tries desperately to meet the psychological as well as physical rigors of 
his predicament. Braugher's Searles is nicely balanced by Cliff DeYoung's 
nasty, corrupt Union colonel, a racist who exploits the war for profit. 
</P>
<P>
As it proceeds to its magnificent climactic battle sequence in Charleston 
harbor, "Glory" reminds us that the Civil War was fought for many reasons. At 
the same time the film, like "Cry Freedom" and "A Dry, White Season," feels it 
must tell of a black struggle from the perspective of a sympathetic and noble 
white. For all that is commendable about "Glory," you nevertheless wish you 
were experiencing it from the perspective of Trip, a man who gets put down 
constantly for telling the truth, but who is obliged by the script to shape up 
and get swept up in the film's selfless heroism, just like everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
Denzel Washington, a born star still waiting for that breakthrough part, brings 
an anguish to Trip that seems to go beyond the role itself. At times Trip seems 
a bit too contemporary in his militance, but then he is not as focal, not as 
developed as he might be. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkable as a period piece and for Freddie Francis's vivid cinematography, 
"Glory" (rated R for battlefield violence) is an impressive accomplishment for 
a director whose only previous theatrical film was the yuppie comedy "About 
Last Night . . ." Although "Glory" is splendid for what it is, it does leave us 
wanting more.

'NEWCOMERS' A SHOWCASE FOR 12 L.A. ARTISTS;

ART: THE ARTISTS ARE MINDING THEIR MANNERS IN BARNSDALL PARK EXHIBITION, BUT

"Newcomers 1990," on view at the Municipal Art Gallery at Barnsdall Park 
through Jan. 7, is a sort of debutantes' ball for emerging artists -- and, as 
at any ball, everyone makes a good appearance here. 
</P>
<P>
Coolly assured and thoroughly professional, these artists stand poised to make 
the leap into the big time -- and the fact that many of them simply rework and 
refurbish ideas and techniques that originated with other artists shouldn't 
prove to be a problem. Abiding by the rules of the salon only increases one's 
collectibility, and these artists clearly understand that it doesn't pay to be 
outrageous or unconventional. 
</P>
<P>
Selected over a two-year period from more than 1,000 portfolios reviewed by 
curator Marie de Alcuaz Kish, "Newcomers 1990" showcases work by 12 artists in 
or around their 30s who have yet to have major solo exhibitions in Los Angeles. 
Half are native Californians, two emigrated here from West Germany and one 
hails from the Virgin Islands. Kish brought a fair hand to her job as curator, 
and the show evidences no personal biases or central theme, nor is there any 
trace of regionalism in this wildly diverse show. Handsomely installed with a 
generous selection of work by each artist, it's a mixed bag that includes 
several different modes of art-making currently considered viable. 
</P>
<P>
The most notable generalization one can make about this art is that it's 
remarkably disengaged. In keeping with the current trend towards cocooning, 
most of these artists eschew any dialogue with current events, choosing instead 
to retreat into private worlds of personal obsessions and symbols. Much of the 
work is hermetic and self-referential, and none of it is particularly joyful. A 
cloud of anxiety hangs over most of the art on view here. 
</P>
<P>
Greeting one in the entrance gallery is Rudy Mercado's "Battle of Washita 
River, Nov. 1868," a living diorama chronicling one of the many savage battles 
waged in the extermination of the American Indian. Involving 800 figures, 500 
horses and 75 tepees molded by the artist in non-drying clay at 5/8-inch scale, 
the piece is executed in six stages; each Monday the artist advances the action 
of the battle by reshaping the figures. It's certainly an informative piece and 
quite an impressive technical feat; however, it seems as though it rightly 
belongs in a historical rather than an art context. 
</P>
<P>
Ute Gruenwald, one of two German artists in the show, explores the theme of the 
harvest as a metaphor for the merging of the natural and the manufactured. Her 
three massive canvases on view -- two aerial views of crops, one of a bubbling 
pot of lentils titled "Boiling Soup" -- put one in mind of Anselm Kiefer; 
there's an impacted, emotional density and a sweeping scale to Gruenwald's 
grand landscapes that's distinctly Kieferesque. Christel Dillbohner, also from 
Germany, works with multiple panels and a palette knife to create heavily 
impastoed images that refer to symbols and architectural elements common in her 
native country. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar formalist vein, Steffani Bailey fashions colorfully painted 
geometric constructions out of oil paint on wood (they're vaguely evocative of 
Frank Stella), while Jacci Den Hartog creates reductive sculptures from 
industrial materials. Her "Model of the Universe" -- six rubber hoses suspended 
from the ceiling dangling black rubber balls -- is like a high-tech Maypole. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey E. Yoshimine provides the peak moments of the show with a series of 
harrowingly intense figure studies. Like Francis Bacon, Yoshimine interprets 
the human form as a bloodied battleground where emotional states are manifested 
in flesh. Sculpting in wax, wire and wood, he fashions freakish forms -- a hand 
that's grown a tiny head, a head trailing an arm like a tail -- that threaten 
to degenerate into the realm of cheap thrills. His paintings, however, are 
another matter -- they're considerably more balanced and subtle. Rendering 
physically anguished forms in a stunningly graceful painting style, he creates 
images of enormous power. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Jon Boyle inhabits a similarly dark realm. Working with vine charcoal on 
paper, Boyle explores the terrors of childhood and the strangling protection of 
parental love. Set at night, usually in a sunless forest choked with vines that 
threaten to engulf the human figures who wander there, his large 
black-and-white drawings are rife with Freudian implications; any form of 
intimacy is invariably interpreted as being fraught with danger. In "Tunnel of 
Love," for instance, a pair of lovers in a rowboat drift ever deeper into dark, 
devouring oblivion. We've all had dates like that, Kevin, and we know where 
you're coming from. 
</P>
<P>
Gavin Lee combines lead sculptures with palladium photographic prints (whose 
tones are warmer and softer than normal silver prints) to create haunting 
reliquaries. As in work by Christian Boltanski (who also builds shrines for his 
photographs), this is essentially a highly emotional form of portraiture, and 
Lee's photographs -- faded images of Asian men and women -- are awash in a 
sense of loss and melancholy. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view are mixed-media paintings exploring biblical themes by Margaret 
Kelley, dopey photo portraits shot at the Renaissance Pleasure Faire by Dennis 
Olanzo Callwood, a series of paintings by Anne Hutton that pay homage to modern 
conveniences (and exploit Ed Ruscha's basic recipe of stenciling words on 
subtly painted fields), and an ambitious mixed-media installation by Michael 
Arata. All of these artists are ripe for the plucking, so expect to see them on 
the local gallery circuit soon.

BLACKS CONSIDERING BOYCOTT OF STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the black community are talking about a boycott against XHRM-FM 
(92.5), making thinly disguised accusations of racism against the Mexican 
owners who last month booted black entrepreneur Willie Morrow from his 
controlling role with the radio station. 
</P>
<P>
For almost 10 years, Morrow represented the Mexican-based station in San Diego, 
paying a monthly fee to the Mexican owners, Radio Moderna Mexicana. He 
programmed specifically to the black community, primarily playing contemporary 
rhythm and blues, rap and funk music. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Radio Moderna Mexicana dropped Morrow and took control of the 
station after Morrow failed to pay his monthly fee for two months. Morrow said 
he didn't pay because the owners didn't help him through financial hardships 
caused by equipment problems. 
</P>
<P>
The owners switched the music format to a contemporary-hits format and dropped 
several of the programs, including a Sunday Gospel show, that were geared to a 
black audience. XHRM was the only station in San Diego specifically targeting 
the black community. 
</P>
<P>
In a Nov. 20 article in the San Diego Union, station owner Luis Rivas Kaloyan 
was quoted as saying: "Willie Morrow programmed to a very narrow audience -- 
black people. We don't want a black station; we want a good station that 
appeals to everybody. We had to step in and save the reputation of the 
station." 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the black community viewed Kaloyan's words, oft-repeated in the 
San Diego Monitor News, the weekly paper Morrow publishes, as borderline 
racist. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Union quoted him accurately, this guy has no respect for the feelings 
of the black community," said Harold Brown, head of the Black Economic 
Development Task Force. "I think it sends one hell of a message to the black 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Kaloyan, who said he has been misquoted and misinterpreted, said his problem 
was solely with Morrow, not the black community. He says Morrow programmed the 
station to the black community to further his political power in the community 
and to promote his line of hair-care products. 
</P>
<P>
Morrow, Kaloyan says, consistently represented himself as the owner of the 
Mexican-based station, which was particularly galling to Kaloyan and his 
family, which owns the station. He accuses Morrow and his compatriots of 
purposely misquoting him and spreading false stories. 
</P>
<P>
"The only issue here is we got rid of the guy" because he didn't meet financial 
obligations, Kaloyan said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Kaloyan issued a press release detailing his longstanding problems 
with Morrow, including charges of bounced checks and misappropriating 
promotional merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
"The quality of the management and staffing has been a continuous problem over 
the years," Kaloyan wrote. "Some merchandise was wrongly sold by Mr. Morrow and 
(his company) for their personal gain. There were also indications of illegal 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
Reached Wednesday, Morrow denied any wrongdoing and said the monthly payment of 
$55,000 was made every month until October. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to say I never bounced a check," Morrow said. "I'm not going to 
say anything to that one way or another." 
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his position that equipment problems, specifically damage to the 
station antenna caused by a storm, ruined the station's cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
Kaloyan said the station's programming under Morrow's leadership was too 
narrowly focused, which limited the station's success. 
</P>
<P>
"The black community is only 7% of San Diego," he said. "To have a successful 
business you can't just identify the station to the black market. You have to 
consider the Hispanic and white listeners too." 
</P>
<P>
The station's new "Power" format, Kaloyan said, includes many of the "urban" 
hits that were a staple of XHRM's old format. Stations carrying similar formats 
are among the ratings leaders in such major markets as New York and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to get away from our responsibility to the black community," 
Kaloyan said, adding that he is attempting to talk to black leaders to smooth 
over differences. 
</P>
<P>
It might not be easy to appease some of Morrow's fellow black leaders, who see 
this as another in a long list of recent slaps endured by blacks in San Diego, 
including the 1987 decision by voters to revoke a city decision to rename 
Market Street after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The Black Economic Development Task Force's Brown said leaders in the black 
community are discussing what actions against XHRM might be appropriate, 
including a boycott against advertisers or a civil-rights march. 
</P>
<P>
In a story in the Monitor News, the Rev. George Stevens, an aide to Rep. Jim 
Bates (D-San Diego), called for members of the community to turn off the 
station. He stopped far short of accusing the station owners of having racially 
oriented motives for switching the station format, but he said their decision 
"does have a negative impact on the African-American community." 
</P>
<P>
He wants an agreement that would reinstate Morrow, as well as the old 
programming format. Brown also said Morrow should be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Morrow said he is not involved in any of the community efforts against XHRM. 
But the Nov. 30 edition of the Monitor News devoted its front page to Kaloyan's 
quote from the Union, reproduced in large bold print below a cartoon depicting 
two men in sombreros, one accepting money from a black and the other speaking 
into a microphone. Several articles have been devoted to the subject as well. 
</P>
<P>
On Page 2 of the same edition, Editor Richard (Tip) Calvin wrote, "Stop 
listening to, stop advertising on a station that does not believe that Black is 
Beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
The cover of the Dec. 7 Monitor carried the banner headline, "Advertisers 
Supports (sic) negative racial slur: Community Outraged." 
</P>
<P>
The Monitor is "trying its best to be neutral," Morrow said. "But it's tough 
when someone makes statements like that." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Menard, formerly the Harrigan half of the popular morning radio team of 
Charlie and Harrigan, was hired by Kaloyan to be XHRM's new general manager at 
the beginning of December. He left a week later to return to a traffic 
reporting service, although he says he left on cordial terms with Kaloyan. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason it (the switch in formats) was perceived as them abandoning 
the black community," Menard said. "From my close conversations with Luis, I 
can say that definitely was not the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"To try to make this a racial issue . . . does not hold any water or any kind 
of validity."

Ailey Recalled: Dancer-choreographer Alvin Ailey was remembered for his 
innovations and artistic passion as a modern dance pioneer Tuesday night by 
about 100 friends and relatives during a 1 1/2-hour funeral service at the 
First Baptist Church of Artesia. The modest ceremony followed a memorial in New 
York last Friday attended by 5,000. Mourners included Jasmine Guy, co-star of 
NBC's "A Different World," who sang the hymn "His Eye Is on the Sparrow." "He 
believed that dance could and should reach everyone. Not through the eyes, ears 
and intellect alone but through the heart and gut as well," wrote Jennifer 
Dunning in the memorial notes. Ailey, 58, died Dec. 1 of a blood disorder. He 
was buried Wednesday morning at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier. The 
Associated Press said there were reports that Ailey had been treated for 
complications related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome during the last 
year. CLAUDIA PUIG

Get Him Off the Road: Bass guitarist John Taylor of the British rock group 
Duran Duran was banned from driving for 12 months and fined the equivalent of 
$400 Wednesday after he admitted drinking while driving. Prosecutor Debbie 
Churaman told Horseferry Magistrates Court that Taylor was stopped on his way 
home early Tuesday by police who saw him speeding and driving erratically 
through London. Taylor's lawyer, Nicholas Price, said the 29-year-old musician 
had worked until midnight Monday and had eaten nothing except a sandwich before 
driving to a party. "I have been very irresponsible," Taylor, 29, said after 
the court appearance. "It's no use blaming anybody else. You know what you are 
doing, and that's it. It was down to me." Duran Duran, an English pop group 
that attracted a large teen following with such hits as 'Hungry Like the Wolf" 
and "A View to a Kill," were an early MTV favorite.

NEA DISASTER RELIEF PACKAGE FOR THE BAY AREA; 
</P>
<P>
THE ARTS: AN EMERGENCY MATCHING GRANT IS DESIGNED TO HELP ARTISTS AND ARTS 
FACILITIES RECOVER FROM THE RAVAGES OF THE OCT. 17 EARTHQUAKE. 
</P>

San Francisco artists and arts institutions will share $550,000 in National 
Endowment for the Arts emergency funds in a matching-grant program announced 
Wednesday that will also include more than $1.6 million in private 
earthquake-relief monies. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual endowment grant is part of a total of $947,000 in emergency 
disaster relief grants announced by the agency. The rest of the money is 
earmarked for arts centers in South Carolina, Puerto Rico and the Virgin 
Islands that were damaged by Hurricane Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite assistance from federal, state and city agencies, the arts community 
in the Bay Area remains without significant resources for recouping its losses 
and beginning the recovery process," said endowment Chairman John E. Frohnmayer 
in announcing the emergency package. 
</P>
<P>
The endowment disaster relief package includes a proviso that $3 in non-federal 
money must be raised for every dollar of federal support. The provision -- the 
endowment's standard matching-grant criterion -- is intended to significantly 
increase the overall arts assistance. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, the federal arts disaster funds will be administered by the 
San Francisco Foundation, a private group that established the Bay Area Arts 
Recovery Fund in the wake of the October temblor. The Oct. 17 quake devastated 
many older buildings in the Bay Area that housed studio and living spaces for 
hundreds of artists, musicians and performers. 
</P>
<P>
Major contributions have already been received from a foundation operated by 
the owners of the Mervyn's and Target department store chains, the City of San 
Francisco and several local foundations. Christine Elbel, coordinator of the 
arts recovery fund, said the California Arts Council is also helping to raise 
money and that arts officials hope to be able to distribute a total of $2.2 
million, beginning sometime next month. 
</P>
<P>
Elbel said three major areas for arts assistance have been targeted: the 
American Contemporary Theater in San Francisco; Santa Cruz County, the 
epicenter of the quake; the rest of the Bay Area, including San Francisco and 
Oakland. The American Contemporary Theater sustained $1 million in operating 
losses because of major structural damage to its theater, forcing the company 
to move all productions in its next two seasons to alternate quarters. The 
temblor occurred just as ACT was preparing for the sold-out final weeks of 
"Right Mind," by writer-producer-director George Coates. 
</P>
<P>
Elbel said the bulk of the new federal and private money will be channeled to 
individual artists and performers and to small and mid-sized arts 
organizations. Large, established Bay Area arts institutions -- including the 
region's major museums, the San Francisco Opera and other major arts centers -- 
apparently have the greatest ability to raise their own recovery funds, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Margie O'Driscoll, liaison for the arts to San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, said 
the overall earthquake relief package "is really quite a fantastic gesture." 
</P>
<P>
O'Driscoll said the funds would play an especially important role in helping 
individual artists and performers who have difficulty meeting rigid criteria 
for Small Business Administration loans. 
</P>
<P>
Endowment funds earmarked in several categories for arts centers hurt by 
Hurricane Hugo include $200,000 would be earmarked for the City of Charleston, 
S.C., office of cultural affairs, and $100,000 for the South Carolina Arts 
Commission. Smaller amounts were earmarked for arts centers in Puerto Rico and 
the Virgin Islands.

IT ISN'T TOO LATE TO INVITE FRIENDS TO SHARE A HOLIDAY MEAL . . . IF YOU SETTLE 
FOR A SIMPLE MENU.

<P>
At last! Everything is in place. The house is decorated to your satisfaction 
with the family's favorite glitter and Christmas ornaments; it smells of pine 
boughs and spicy holiday-scented potpourri and looks wonderfully warm and 
welcoming. But, now that it's all ready to be admired, there's no one around to 
enjoy it but you and yours. 
</P>
<P>
Bummer! 
</P>
<P>
So have a party. Not a big party, mind you. It's a little late to be planning a 
major do-it-yourself production before the holidays. But there's plenty of time 
to share some Christmas cheer and good, simple food with close friends, if you 
choose a menu based on easily prepared foods. 
</P>
<P>
With old-fashioned home cooking enjoying a resurgence in popularity, simple 
meals are in fashion these days. Meat loaves, potatoes, stews and other solid, 
dependable foods are definitely trendy. And most of these wonderful, old-style 
foods are now as much at home on a party table as glitzy hummingbirds' tongues 
used to be. 
</P>
<P>
There are many advantages to this trend toward simpler, less complicated meals. 
Most recipes for foods of this sort call for ordinary, readily available 
ingredients. What makes them special depends on you. How daring are you when it 
comes to varying the seasonings, and how creative are you in presenting them? 
</P>
<P>
Consider meat loaf, for instance. It doesn't have to start with hamburger, and 
it doesn't have to be baked in a loaf pan. Instead, make it with ground lamb 
and season it with water chestnuts, oregano and a hint of green chile. Then 
gussy up your presentation by forming the mixture into a crescent shape and 
baking it with a batch of potato rounds seasoned with garlic. In just about an 
hour you'll have an upscale meat and potatoes meal that should delight family 
and friends alike. 
</P>
<P>
Another meat and potatoes meal that uses familiar ingredients Grandma would 
easily recognize is a ham and sweet potato combination that sports some 1989 
seasonings and techniques. The ham is used in a sweet-and-sour stir-fry sauce 
that is spooned over baked sweet potatoes. It's an easy, no-fuss main dish that 
visually whets the appetite when you invite your guests to the table. 
</P>
<P>
Another simple party dish that's sure to please company is our Sole and 
Macadamia Roll-Ups. Ground macadamia nuts and green onions are used as a 
filling for the rolled-up sole fillets and additional nuts are sprinkled on 
top. The result is a wonderful quick and easy main dish that is suitable for 
many an occasion.

THE BUTCHER: BEEF TENDERLOIN IS CENTERPIECE OF ELEGANT MEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At this time of year newspapers and food magazines are filled with ideas for 
marvelous holiday meals large enough to feed a small army of friends and 
family. It occurs to me, however, that there is a large and growing number of 
us who are not going to be cooking for a crowd. There are also, I'm equally 
sure, a large number who -- even during the holidays -- don't want to spend all 
day in the kitchen. For those in either category, here is a little easy 
elegance for holiday dining. 
</P>
<P>
I think there is no more simple cut of meat in the world to work with than a 
piece of beef tenderloin. Even the tenderloin of an old bull would melt in your 
mouth, so you don't have to worry about what to buy. 
</P>
<P>
Nor should you worry much about how to cook it. It's hard to go wrong. Simply 
grilled or roasted rare beef served with red wine and a few sliced tomatoes 
makes a great meal. Tenderloin even makes a delicious dish served raw. It's 
called carpaccio. Simply slice beef tenderloin very, very thin, arrange the 
slices on a plate and dress them with a good olive oil, a squeeze of lemon, a 
grind of coarse black pepper and a grating of Parmesan cheese. A great dish for 
a first course. 
</P>
<P>
But for an easy, elegant holiday meal for two or four people, buy a 
well-trimmed, two-pound piece of beef tenderloin and stuff it yourself. The 
best part of the tenderloin for stuffing is the part the French call the 
chateaubriand. 
</P>
<P>
Here are a couple of ways to do it, neither of which should take you more than 
30 minutes in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
MUSHROOM-ONION STUFFED BEEF TENDERLOIN 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 to 2 pounds beef tenderloin 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
4 to 6 pearl onions 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup beef broth 
</P>
<P>
4 to 6 small button mushrooms 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon flour 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup red wine 
</P>
<P>
Make horizontal cut in 1 side of tenderloin and flatten out. Be careful not to 
cut entirely through meat. Leave about 1-inch hinge. Pound meat to overall 
thickness of about 3/4 to 1 inch. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
Peel and parboil pearl onions in beef broth until just tender. Reserve broth. 
</P>
<P>
Cut mushrooms in half or quarters, depending on size, and saute in 1 tablespoon 
butter in heavy skillet until just tender. Place onions and mushrooms at 1 end 
of beef so when rolled up, stuffing will be in center. Roll up jelly-roll 
fashion and tie with string at about 1-inch intervals. 
</P>
<P>
Add remaining butter to same skillet in which mushrooms were sauteed and brown 
meat well on all sides. Transfer to roasting pan and roast at 475 degrees 15 to 
20 minutes for medium rare. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkle flour into mushroom pan and cook, stirring over medium heat, until 
nicely browned and mixed well with all pan drippings. Pour in reserved beef 
broth and red wine. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce has reduced and thickened. Slice 
stuffed tenderloin into 1/2-inch thick slices and serve with sauce. Makes 2 to 
4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Serve with rice or barley pilaf. 
</P>
<P>
STUFFED BEEF TENDERLOIN 
</P>
<P>
(Italian Style) 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 to 2 pounds beef tenderloin 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Coarse ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 hard-cooked egg 
</P>
<P>
1 egg, lightly beaten 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon capers 
</P>
<P>
2 to 3 anchovy fillets, minced 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
1 bunch spinach, chopped 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons brandy 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup beef broth 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
Make horizontal cut in 1 side of beef tenderloin and flatten out. Be careful 
not to cut entirely through meat. Leave about 1-inch hinge. Season to taste 
with pepper. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Mash hard-cooked egg in large bowl and add beaten egg, capers, anchovy fillets, 
garlic and chopped spinach. Mix thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
Spread spinach-egg mixture over meat. Roll up jellyroll fashion and tie with 
string at 1-inch intervals. 
</P>
<P>
Heat olive oil in heavy skillet over high heat and brown meat well on all 
sides. Transfer to roasting pan and roast at 475 degrees 15 to 20 minutes for 
medium rare. 
</P>
<P>
Add brandy to skillet in which meat was browned and cook, stirring over medium 
heat, to loosen any particles in bottom of pan. Add beef broth and continue 
cooking, stirring occasionally, until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly. 
</P>
<P>
Stir in butter just before serving to finish sauce. Slice stuffed tenderloin 
and serve with just enough sauce on each slice to moisten. Makes 2 to 4 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Serve with rich, creamy risotto.

BACK TO BASICS: TO MASH, RICE OR WHIP -- PONDERING THE OPTIONS OF POTATO 
PREPARATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it comes to mashed potatoes, there is little consensus about what is 
correct or incorrect. The answers to such questions as what is the best utensil 
to use for mashing the spuds and whether they should or shouldn't have lumps 
are strictly a matter of personal preference. 
</P>
<P>
What does make a difference, however, is the variety used for mashing. Of the 
two basic types of potatoes -- waxy and nonwaxy -- the latter are best suited 
for this procedure because of their low sugar and high starch content. 
</P>
<P>
If placed in a solution of one of pound salt in one gallon of water, waxy 
potatoes will float, while more dense nonwaxy potatoes will sink to the bottom. 
Unfortunately, this is not a very practical test to conduct while shopping at 
the supermarket, so generally speaking, rely on the thick-skinned potatoes such 
as russets to be nonwaxy. 
</P>
<P>
Select potatoes that are firm, free from large cuts, growth cracks and 
sprouting eyes. Avoid any with green tinged skins. 
</P>
<P>
According to "The Whole Potato Catalog," a publication of the Potato Board, 
potatoes to be mashed may be either boiled or steamed: 
</P>
<P>
"To Boil: In a heavy saucepan with tight-fitting lid, cook potatoes in about 
one inch of boiling, salted water until fork-tender. Whole, 30 to 40 minutes; 
cut-up, 20 to 25 minutes. (If lid doesn't fit tightly, water may boil away so 
check occasionally and add more water if necessary.) 
</P>
<P>
"To Steam: Place wire rack on bottom of a kettle or large saucepan and add 
water to just below the level of the rack. Bring the water to a boil, add 
potatoes and cook, tightly covered, until fork-tender. Whole, 30 to 45 minutes; 
cut-up, 20 to 30 minutes. (Check occasionally to see if water should be added, 
if lid is not tight fitting.)" 
</P>
<P>
Most people prefer to peel potatoes before cooking, however this step can be 
done afterwards, or when using a ricer may be eliminated to save time. During 
boiling, pieces of nonwaxy varieties tend to slough off and the potatoes lose 
their shape. Once cooked, boiled potatoes should be drained well before 
mashing. 
</P>
<P>
Milk, evaporated milk, half and half or cream may be used when mashing 
potatoes. Whatever the choice, it should be heated; adding cold liquid cools 
the potatoes and tends to make them gummy. 
</P>
<P>
The more liquid used, the more creamy and thinner the end product. The amount 
needed also varies depending on the potatoes -- soil, climate and fertilizer 
used during growth all have their effects. Softened butter or margarine, salt 
and pepper are optional additions. 
</P>
<P>
Use a potato masher, electric mixer or ricer to mash the potatoes. Following 
are techniques for using each device. 
</P>
<P>
POTATO MASHER: Press the tool into the potatoes in a downward motion, forcing 
them through the cutting grid. Gradually add milk, butter and salt and pepper 
to taste, beating with the potato masher, fork or wire whisk until light and 
fluffy. 
</P>
<P>
ELECTRIC MIXER: Begin by mashing the potatoes slightly with the stationary 
beaters. Turn the mixer on low speed and whip to the desired consistency, 
gradually adding milk, butter and salt and pepper to taste. 
</P>
<P>
RICER: Place the boiled potatoes in the perforated cylinder, then squeeze the 
long handles together to force the contents through the ricer holes. Let the 
rice-like pieces mound in the serving dish. Gradually add milk, butter and salt 
and pepper to taste and beat the potatoes with a fork, spoon or wire whisk 
until light and fluffy. 
</P>
<P>
Most sources agree that mashed potatoes are best served immediately. If they 
must be held, spoon into a buttered casserole and smooth a light film of cream 
over the top. Keep warm in an oven heated to 250 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Another technique is to set the pan of finished potatoes in a larger one of hot 
water. Cover with a towel to absorb the steam.

THE VEGETARIAN: LAYERED PATE ADDS UP TO FESTIVE, FLAVORFUL DISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
I've often been tempted by the multitiered vegetable pates displayed in delis, 
only to find that their beauty belies blandness and monotony, that it is simply 
impossible to taste one layer from another. 
</P>
<P>
In this version, neither the creamy layer of spinach nor the next of 
Sherry-spiked mushrooms nor the third, a sweet and tangy blend of apricot and 
carrot, dominate. Instead, the layers harmonize in a dish that is festive in 
flavor and style. You can streamline preparation by having all the ingredients 
set out before you start and by washing skillets and bowls after each layer so 
they're ready to go for the next.

HINTS FROM HELOISE: BURNED FINGER TEACHES LESSON ON MICROWAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: We all love our microwave ovens and wouldn't trade them for 
anything, but, as the old saying should go, "Familiarity breeds complacency." I 
fell victim to this and wanted to warn others, especially mothers with small 
children, to be alert to the different pattern of heating that results from 
microwaves. 
</P>
<P>
I heated a toaster pastry in the microwave oven and left it for 20 seconds as 
recommended on the box, but the pastry was still cool. However, it broke as I 
lifted it from the plate and a piece of the filling hit my finger. The filling 
was red hot. Hot enough, in fact, to cause a second-degree burn, with a 
blister, that was painful for about three hours even with ice held on it. 
</P>
<P>
I was lucky that it broke and burned only my finger. It could have been much 
worse had I taken a bite. The directions on the box clearly state "Caution: 
Fillings may become very hot." Because I'm so used to heating things in the 
microwave, though, I didn't pay any attention. 
</P>
<P>
Please remind everyone that foods heat differently in microwave ovens than they 
do in toasters or conventional ovens, so pay attention to instructions and 
warnings to avoid burns. 
</P>
<P>
 -- LEARNED LESSON, 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 
</P>
<P>
DEAR LEARNED: Sorry you learned your lesson with a burned finger, but I 
appreciate your reminding all of us that whether you've been using a microwave 
for two months or 10 years, you still need to pay attention to directions and 
precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I have an easy way to save money on coffee. I make the first pot 
in a drip coffee maker with the regular amount of ground coffee. I leave the 
grounds in the pot, and then for the second pot of coffee, I put half the 
normal amount of ground coffee on top of them and brew as usual. 
</P>
<P>
For the third pot, however, I throw everything out and start all over. Economy 
is great, but if you carry it too far you lose fresh coffee flavor. And that is 
what we drink it for. 
</P>
<P>
 -- ESTHER, Red Oak, Iowa 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I love apples and want to buy plenty of them while they're on 
sale, but I'm not sure how to keep them. I don't want to try canning; will 
freezing work? 
</P>
<P>
 -- SANDRA, Seattle 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SANDRA: You bet. Apples freeze well for later use in pies, sauce and 
cooked dishes. Just peel, core and slice them, sprinkle with lemon juice or 
ascorbic acid (available at the grocery or supermarket) to keep them from 
turning brown, and put them in freezer containers or plastic freezer bags. Pack 
them in specific quantities, like 1-cup, 2-cup and 3-cup packs, so you'll have 
pre-measured amounts when you're ready to use them. Toss in the freezer, then 
use with your favorite recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I've found that kitchen utensils can serve many more purposes 
than those they were designed for. I use my pastry blender to chop hard-boiled 
egg yolks for deviled eggs. And an old pastry brush with a long handle does a 
super job of cleaning out the deep lint trap in my dryer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- NANCY, Shelbyville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: When I bake a pie, the edges of the crust burn, yet when I cover 
them with foil, it (the foil) falls off. Is there a better way? 
</P>
<P>
 -- SUSAN, Baltimore 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SUSAN: Here's an easy-as-pie hint. Simply cover the pie completely with 
foil and securely crimp the edges under the rim of the pie plate. Next, 
carefully cut out the center of the foil, leaving the top of the pie exposed. 
</P>
<P>
The foil doesn't pop off the edges of the crust and you can enjoy the pie. 
</P>
<P>

COCONUT ADDS A LUSCIOUS TASTE TO FESTIVE CAKES FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON

after the holidays. Each of the cakes includes coconut, but there the 
similarity ends. 
</P>
<P>
Prize Coconut Cake incorporates the coconut into the batter, as well as using 
it for the crowning touch. Lemon Butter Cream Frosting, a basic frosting with 
grated lemon peel and juice, adds a just-right tartness to complement the cake. 
</P>
<P>
Chopped sweet cooking chocolate, coconut and raisins add moistness and texture 
to Chocolate-Coconut Pound Cake. A Sweet Chocolate Glaze further emphasizes the 
rich, chocolate goodness of the cake. 
</P>
<P>
After baking and cooling Pina Colada Cake, a warm glaze of crushed pineapple 
and rum is spooned over before the coconut-and-orange section garnish is added.

or with a coconut garnish.

HOLIDAY SOUFFLE IS QUICK, EASY, ELEGANT DESSERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GILLINGHAM, Gillingham is a free-lance writer and a food stylist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talk quick and easy cooking and the mind doesn't exactly eye a souffle. Too 
bad, it could. 
</P>
<P>
You are just too busy this time of year, even if you do think a high-rise 
dessert is exactly what holiday guests would like to finish off dinner at your 
house. Too bad, you could do it. 
</P>
<P>
Even when I have the tree to trim, gifts to wrap, kids to talk to, cookies to 
bake and company coming, my mind doesn't mind eyeing the idea of serving 
individual Chocolate-Espresso Souffles for dessert. I know, I've done it. 
</P>
<P>
I've baked them for Christmas, for New Year's Eve, for Tuesday's dinner, for 
important guests, for children, for big people and just for me. It's that 
simple and delicious. 
</P>
<P>
The secret is, because these souffles don't depend on fragile stiffly beaten 
egg whites for success, they can be mixed several hours ahead of time and 
refrigerated until ready to bake. 
</P>
<P>
Each souffle gets a light dusting of sweetened instant espresso powder as soon 
as it comes from the oven. If you've a mind to bake them before the holiday 
season ends, you might want to perch a holly leaf atop or alongside each 
souffle to add a seasonal touch. 
</P>
<P>
You could say the recipe is a piece of cake if it weren't a souffle. 
</P>
<P>
CHOCOLATE-ESPRESSO SOUFFLES 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup espresso coffee 
</P>
<P>
6 ounces semisweet chocolate 
</P>
<P>
5 eggs 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
8 ounces cream cheese, cubed 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon instant espresso powder 
</P>
<P>
Combine espresso and chocolate in small saucepan and place over low heat until 
chocolate is melted, stirring to blend. Remove from heat and cool slightly. 
</P>
<P>
Combine eggs and cream in food processor or blender and process to mix. With 
machine running, slowly pour in cooled chocolate mixture. Add cream cheese, few 
cubes at time and process until smooth. Pour into 6 buttered and sugared 
6-ounce souffle cups. (At this point, souffles can be covered and refrigerated 
up to several hours.) 
</P>
<P>
Bake on center shelf of oven at 350 degrees about 20 minutes or until edges are 
set but centers are still slightly soft. (If souffles were refrigerated, bake 
additional 5 minutes.) 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, combine powdered sugar and espresso powder. As soon as souffles are 
done, remove from oven, place each on individual dessert plate and shake some 
sugar-espresso mixture through sieve on top of each souffle. Serve immediately. 
Makes 6 servings.

Since no one can predict just when guests will show up during the Christmas 
season, it's always a good idea to have plenty of snacks on hand for impromptu 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
Spiced Walnuts will keep well for up to two weeks when stored in an airtight 
container. These flavored nuts, accented with the exotic flavors of cumin and 
curry, also make great gifts. Pack them securely in glass jars or canisters and 
tie with a holiday bow. 
</P>

SPICED WALNUTS 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>

<P>
1 tablespoon ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>

THE SHRINES OF BUDDHA; 
</P>
<P>
TEMPLES: BUDDHISTS ARE VISITING HIGHLAND PARK SANCTUARIES TO COMMEMORATE THE 
PURIFICATION OF BUDDHA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Except for the colorful paper lanterns and large statue of the mother of Buddha 
in its front yard, the narrow house on North Figueroa Street in Highland Park 
hardly merits a second look. 
</P>
<P>
Such details might merely indicate Asian occupants. But the wooden bungalow in 
the 6800 block of Figueroa houses a Buddhist shrine. 
</P>
<P>
It is headquarters for the Pureland Lotus Community, an organization of 
Vietnamese Buddhists. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the only Buddhist sanctuary inconspicuously nestled among 
Western-style houses, apartments and small businesses in northeast Los Angeles. 
Down the street about two miles, at Figueroa and Avenue 52, is the Mystic 
Dharma temple. A few blocks west in the 900 block of Terrace 49, on Mt. 
Washington, is the Kanzeonji Zen house of prayer. 
</P>
<P>
The three temples represent divergent strains of Buddhism from Vietnam, China 
and Japan. This week the faithful of all three are visiting their shrines to 
commemorate one of Buddhism's most important events, the purification of 
Buddha. 
</P>
<P>
Although the rituals at each shrine may vary, worshipers usually come bearing 
offerings of flowers, fruits and pastry to put on an altar lightly clouded by 
the smoke of incense and candles. As the members gather, a priest leads the 
chant of prayers retelling the life of Buddha on earth. 
</P>
<P>
He was born Siddartha Gautama in India to a wealthy family. His deification in 
566 B.C., marking his attainment of enlightenment through meditation and 
rejection of materialism, is the event being celebrated this week. The Buddha's 
teachings first spread north through Asia over the next thousand years and came 
to the United States in the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Handbook of Denominations, the first Buddhist temple in the 
United States was consecrated in San Francisco a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 the Buddhist Churches of America said there were 250,000 followers of 
Buddha in America practicing in 62 temples, the largest of which is in Hacienda 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Last winter the Buddhist spiritual leaders gathered in Hacienda Heights' temple 
complex for the 16th conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhists. It was 
the first time that the biennial conference was held outside Asia. 
</P>
<P>
In America some temples are formed by immigrants as a part of their ethnic 
expression and others are established to spread the teachings of Buddha to new 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Ryugen Watanabe of the Kanzeonji Zen shrine is one of the Buddhist 
spiritual leaders who has reached beyond Asian followers. 
</P>
<P>
At the Kanzeonji Zen shrine, 34-year-old Watanabe and his followers sat all day 
Saturday in meditation before an altar that was donated by Japanese 
businessmen. Watanabe, who was born in Japan, said that 90% of his members are 
Caucasians. He has all of the shrine's literature printed in English to 
encourage membership from all backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Pureland Lotus and the Mystic Dharma, on the other hand, are oriented 
toward immigrants who speak Vietnamese and Mandarin Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
Thich Duy Tin, an apprentice priest, said most of the members of the Pureland 
Lotus shrine are Vietnamese from Monterey Park, which has a population that is 
slightly more than 50% Asian. 
</P>
<P>
Lily Lee, a worshiper, said the Mystic Dharma temple caters to Los Angeles 
worshipers originally from mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said the priest who usually presides over the monthly services was in Hong 
Kong to oversee the construction of two gigantic statues for the temple, which 
is on property the Buddhist congregation bought from a Christian church about 
nine years ago. Because he could not return in time for the purification 
services, worshipers conducted their services with a tape-recording of the 
ritual chants, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said that up to a hundred worshipers would attend the big services 
conducted in the main sanctuary. Otherwise, about 10 members come to the 
monthly services in the basement of the fenced two-story building. 
</P>
<P>
It is largely coincidence that Highland Park has become home to three Buddhist 
shrines. The Pureland Lotus and Mystic Dharma, whose congregations are widely 
dispersed, merely found the right buildings at the right price. 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe, who ties his waist-length hair in a ponytail, said that it was no 
coincidence that he established his shrine in northeast Los Angeles. He said 
divine guidance informed him that Mt. Washington was one of the holiest 
mountains in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I didn't like Los Angeles at all," he said. His first home here 
was a car, but then a friend asked him to watch the house on Mt. Washington. 
The friend never came back. Eventually, Watanabe bought it and started his 
teachings in 1983. It was also through unforeseen circumstances that Watanabe 
and his followers bought the house across the street from the shrine for a yoga 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many people were attending my yoga class, and it was crowded here," he 
said. "I had been praying to Buddha to tell me what to do. Then one day, a real 
estate man knocked on the door and asked if I knew of anyone who wanted to rent 
the house across the street." 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe said he and his disciples make incense, body oils, meditation cushions 
and greeting cards to support the temple. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned through meditation that I have been doing this for many lives," 
Watanabe said. "I want to help the world. It hurts me so much to see what is 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
He said he came to America in the 1960s after a friend told him of a prediction 
saying that world peace will be attained when a tribe of American Indians 
receive Buddha's teachings from two holy men from the East. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that might be me," he said.

It is the best of times and the worst of times for 83 emotionally damaged boys 
and girls in the children's program at Camarillo State Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday decorations are going up in the dormitories and the toys collected 
by a half-dozen civic groups have begun to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming weeks, church choirs will pass this way to sing their Christmas 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
The Marines have come from Point Mugu with bags of goodies. Closer to 
Christmas, the Sheriff's Department will fly Santa in by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
For many of these young mental patients -- some of them just 8 years old -- it 
will be a happy season. 
</P>
<P>
But for others, according to the doctors and the social workers, it will be a 
time of special sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo State Hospital is one of only two state mental institutions in 
California that treats children. 
</P>
<P>
They come here from all over Southern California, but mostly from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest patient is 17, but the average age is about 12. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Chandlee is director of the children's program at Camarillo. She and some 
of her key staff aides gathered last week to talk about the children there. 
</P>
<P>
They spoke about the lives the children led before they arrived in Camarillo, 
what life is like for them inside a mental hospital and the changes in mood and 
behavior that come at Christmas time. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the children have come from broken homes where there was serious drug 
or alcohol abuse, and 75% of them have suffered sexual and physical abuse, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Before they could be admitted to Camarillo State Hospital, they were passed 
around from foster homes to private residential treatment centers for disturbed 
children. 
</P>
<P>
But they proved to be too difficult to control, and the decision was made to 
place them in the most restrictive treatment environment available in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"They have conduct disorders," said Cyril Mathai, a Camarillo psychiatrist. 
"They come to us having been unmanageable in other settings. Some are 
depressed. Maybe 25% have tried suicide. Some are psychotic." 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the children are on some sort of medication, usually Ritalin, 
to help control their behavior, Mathai said. 
</P>
<P>
"One common thread that runs through the group is impulsivity," he said. "Our 
most common patient is one who is impulse-ridden and can't be controlled." 
</P>
<P>
Although some of the children at Camarillo have supportive parents who visit 
frequently and bring them home for visits at Christmas and other times of the 
year, the majority have little contact with their mothers or fathers at any 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of these children never had what you might consider a normal Christmas at 
home," Mathai said. "Some don't know what goes on at Christmastime elsewhere. 
It is a good time of year for them here. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids get all kinds of toys. The community is very generous," he added. 
"The staff works harder to make it a happy time. We try to make up for lost 
families." 
</P>
<P>
But there are some differences among the children in their reactions to 
Christmas that break down along age lines. 
</P>
<P>
"Among the younger kids, the mood is generally happier. They are jollier," 
Mathai said. "For older kids, there is the awareness that Christmas is a family 
time and that they are not with their families. So there is a difference 
there." 
</P>
<P>
As Mathai and other staff members spoke, some of the children played outside in 
a fenced playground area, two boys scuffling because one had tossed the other's 
hat over the fence. 
</P>
<P>
In the three 25-bed dorms that house the children, small groups clustered 
around television sets in the day areas or sat quietly by themselves as a 
visitor was escorted through the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The children's area at Camarillo is set well apart from the hospital areas that 
hold the 1,100 adult patients at the facility, roughly half of them mentally 
ill, the other half developmentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by hills, the setting is a peaceful one for children whose lives 
have been an unending horror story. 
</P>
<P>
"We talk about them as a group, and we put labels on them," said social worker 
Bonnie Behrens. "But the kids here are all real individuals. Some work real 
hard to overcome their problems. Some are really cute. Some are dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the kids are not in touch with their parents," she added. "If some of 
them go away at Christmas, it is a reminder to the others. They are a little 
moodier. It is not an easy time for them." 
</P>
<P>
The typical child patient at Camarillo stays for about 15 months, and is then 
judged ready to be placed in some less restrictive setting. Some, with parents 
capable of supporting them, ultimately make it home again. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to help the children at Camarillo develop to the point where they 
can ultimately go on to lead something approaching normal life outside an 
institutional setting. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo officials said there are no good statistics on how many make it and 
how many end up spending their adult lives in mental wards. Some of the kids 
will make it, others won't. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of our kids are completely cured," Mathai said. 
</P>
<P>
But Christmas at Camarillo is not a time when hospital officials choose to 
dwell on the harsh realities that confront them on a daily basis throughout the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
It is a time for the choirs to sing and the Marines to come and Santa to land 
by helicopter. And also a time when the most detached of mental health 
professionals can let their emotional guard down just a bit. 
</P>
<P>
"The staff empathizes," said Mathai. "There are times here when you have to be 
very firm. But this time of year you tend to give them an extra pat and a hug."

OXNARD PORT CONSIDERS COMPUTERIZED CARGO PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: IF BUILT, THE COMPUTERIZED SYSTEM CALLED OMNIPORT COULD -- AT A 
COST OF MORE THAN $80 MILLION -- TRIPLE THE 750,000 TONS NOW PROCESSED EACH 
YEAR IN VENTURA COUNTY.

Oxnard Harbor District commissioners this week enthusiastically embraced a 
proposal for an automated cargo-transporting system that could spin off more 
than 2,000 jobs and bring about $530 million into Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The system, which would be called Omniport Hueneme, would be one of five such 
computerized terminals in the nation. The project proposed by CMT Systems of 
San Francisco is estimated to cost between $80 million and $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Omniport is a modern, state-of-the-art installation," Commissioner Ray 
Fletcher said. "It's an unusual opportunity for the Port of Hueneme to join the 
vanguard." 
</P>
<P>
The district commissioners, who govern the Port of Hueneme, voted 4 to 0 to 
look further into the proposal. Commissioner Cecil Schnelle was absent. 
</P>
<P>
This fall the port completed construction of a $13-million wharf to expand 
services. 
</P>
<P>
But the Omniport system would allow the port to almost triple the 750,000 tons 
of cargo it currently processes each year. 
</P>
<P>
That would mean the port, constrained by its current boundaries and facilities, 
could dramatically increase its $4-million gross annual income. 
</P>
<P>
The Port of Hueneme now uses trucks with forklifts to transfer cargo to 
shipside, where special gear loads it. 
</P>
<P>
The computerized Omniport system would increase productivity by receiving 
cargo, storing it and feeding it to the ship at a uniform speed. 
</P>
<P>
The Port of Hueneme was chosen because it handles cargoes that are divided into 
relatively small units, such as lumber and fruit, for which the Omniport was 
designed. 
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the system could be in operation by 1995. But the project 
must pass a series of hurdles before it is brought before harbor commissioners 
for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
Backers must perform environmental assessments, win support from various 
government agencies and reach agreements with the Ventura County Railroad and 
the Del Monte Tropical Fruit Co., a primary port user for the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
However, Del Monte's terminal manager, James Dawson, sent the commissioners a 
letter which questioned whether Omniport is worth the cost. 
</P>
<P>
"I must insist the inconvenience and associated expense be reviewed," Dawson's 
letter said. 
</P>
<P>
The CMT proposal states that Oxnard Harbor District would pay 20% of the 
project's costs. The remainder would be borne by CMT. In return, CMT would own 
and operate the terminal, leasing land at the port from the harbor district. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners have not yet decided how they would finance the port's 
expenditure, said William Buenger, deputy executive director of the port. 
</P>
<P>
CMT is operating a similar facility in Houston that was completed in July, 
1989. It is scheduled to complete construction of a terminal in Napier, New 
Zealand, next month. 
</P>
<P>
The Omniport Hueneme project has been under consideration for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It means we have moved into the big time, and we will play a big part in the 
economy of Ventura County," Commissioner Bob Jennings said.

TRIAL REVEALS WEB OF FRAUD IN S&amp;L FAILURE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: WESTLAKE THRIFT &amp; LOAN THRIVED AT FIRST, BUT NOT UNTIL AFTER IT 
COLLAPSED DID TWO INVESTIGATIONS REVEAL THE FULL EXTENT OF THE FIRM'S 
QUESTIONABLE BANKING PRACTICES. 
</P>

<P>
It was among the fastest-growing savings and loan companies in the nation -- 
willing to gamble on its customers and eager to make loans many banks would not 
consider. 
</P>
<P>
The first years of the 1980s were a boom time for Westlake Thrift &amp; Loan of 
Westlake Village as it grew into a company of more than 100 employees and 
almost $100 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
Automobile loans were a company specialty. The word was out that Westlake 
Thrift virtually wanted to corner the car-loan market in Ventura County, and it 
almost succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
"They grew by taking a lot of low-quality loans. They were writing $64 million 
in auto loans a year," one government official said. "An 18-year-old kid with 
no credit could finance a new Cadillac through Westlake, and every car dealer 
in the county knew it." 
</P>
<P>
But something was drastically wrong. In July, 1988, Westlake Thrift went out of 
business. Federal regulators gave no reason for the collapse, and the exact 
nature of the company's many problems was not initially revealed. 
</P>
<P>
What was not disclosed at the time of the business collapse, however, was that 
much more than questionable banking practices was involved in both the rise and 
fall of Westlake Thrift. 
</P>
<P>
An FBI investigation already was well under way into allegations that at least 
one bank official was part of a large-scale fraud scheme involving millions of 
dollars in bogus loans -- some of them written to people who never even 
existed. 
</P>
<P>
This week the full story of Westlake Thrift's demise became clearer as the 
financial institution's former president, Steven Smith, 46, of Thousand Oaks, 
pleaded guilty in federal court in Los Angeles to charges of conspiracy, fraud 
and misapplication of bank funds. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Smith was entering his guilty pleas, the FBI and the U. S. attorney's 
office in Los Angeles were pressing forward with their inquiry into Westlake 
Thrift, as well as the activities of some officials of the thrift's parent 
company, United Community Bank of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
It is too early to say where the continuing investigation will lead, officials 
said. Already, however, court documents and interviews provide a detailed 
account of what went wrong inside one of Ventura County's most aggressive 
lending institutions. 
</P>
<P>
In sketching the anatomy of a thrift and loan collapse, federal officials begin 
the story with a man named Walter Vladovich, 55, a Riverside businessman who 
allegedly set out in the mid-1980s to build the largest chain of video stores 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Vladovich, the lead defendant in a 26-count federal bank fraud indictment 
returned in early December, has pleaded not guilty to all charges that he 
conspired with Smith and others to set up the phony loan scheme. He is awaiting 
trial in U. S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to Assistant U. S. Atty. David C. Scheper, Vladovich and Smith 
were the central figures in a fraudulent scheme in which $4 million in loans 
from Westlake Thrift were channeled into a Riverside company called Leader 
Video. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of sources said Vladovich, who also owned a mortgage firm called 
Pioneer Acceptance Corp. of Riverside, allegedly began his fraudulent 
activities in 1984 with a banker named Henry Schneider, vice president of First 
United Thrift and Loan of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Vladovich is accused of submitting false loan packages to Schneider for video 
store franchises that supposedly were going to be operated by some of his own 
employees and others. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, he sold some legitimate stores, then he coerced employees to submit 
paper work that they were buying the stores," one source told The Times. 
"Schneider helped him get 38 or 40 loans in all. Vladovich was the one actually 
making the payments and keeping the money." 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement between Vladovich and Schneider allegedly lasted about a year. 
Scheper said Vladovich received about $550,000 in loans and paid $15,000 in 
bribes to Schneider. Scheper said Schneider has agreed to plead guilty to three 
counts of conspiracy and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
First United ultimately was absorbed by a larger bank, however, and the loans 
to Vladovich were stopped in 1985. About that time, sources said, Schneider 
introduced Vladovich to Westlake Thrift officials. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting Smith, who then was a vice president of Westlake Thrift, 
Vladovich allegedly came up with a different scheme that involved obtaining 
$5,000 loan packages through Pioneer Acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
The loan packages were submitted to Westlake Thrift on behalf of individuals 
who supposedly were going to buy 48 video movies and video equipment with which 
to launch their own video store businesses -- a tiny inventory that alone would 
have warned off serious investors. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, according to federal officials, Vladovich initially enlisted 
applicants for the loans by telling them that he would give them $1,000 in 
video equipment for the use of their names and would make the actual 
$200-a-month loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, officials said, Vladovich kept the $5,000 loans from Westlake. 
They said it was made clear to most of those who signed up for the loan 
packages that they would not actually be getting 48 movies or the chance to 
open a store. 
</P>
<P>
As one source described it: "What Vladovich told customers was, 'I'm trying to 
go public on the New York Stock Exchange. To do that, I need 100 stores. I'm a 
wealthy man. I've got enough money to do it myself, but it's tied up. If you 
fill out the loan application, you won't have any problems. I'll make the 
payments for you and give you $1,000 worth of video equipment.' " 
</P>
<P>
According to Scheper, Vladovich and his salesmen processed more than 800 loans 
worth about $4 million. He allegedly used some of the money to pay himself a 
$1,800-a-month salary and to cover his business operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, the loan applicants were real people," one source said. 
"Some of the first people Vladovich contacted were California Highway Patrol 
officers in the San Bernardino area. He made a pitch to about 35 of them and 
got them signed up for the free video stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem was that the Highway Patrol people were asking too many 
questions," the source added. "They also were too demanding in terms of the 
kinds of free TVs and VCRs that they wanted. They were getting to be a real 
pain to do business with." 
</P>
<P>
For a while, another source said, the sales staff turned away from the Highway 
Patrol to Mexican workers. They asked fewer questions and were not as 
demanding. The cost of business was also less. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of giving them both a television set and a VCR, they just gave the 
Mexicans their choice of a VCR or a television," The Times was told. 
</P>
<P>
The salesmen working for Vladovich were Jerry Tulak, 29, of Ontario; George 
Loayza Sr., 52; and his son, George Loayza Jr., 25, both of Eagle Rock. Like 
Smith, all have pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges in connection with the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, a variety of sources said, Vladovich put heavy pressure on his 
sales staff to write an increasing number of loan applications. The pressure 
allegedly increased when Vladovich needed additional funding for another 
business venture, a novelty company called Bric-a-Brac. 
</P>
<P>
"The salesmen had signed up members of their families by this point, and 
Vladovich was making the payments for them," one source said. "They started 
going to shopping malls and getting names from shoppers. It reached the point 
where they would make up Social Security numbers and submit the loans for 
fictitious people." 
</P>
<P>
Westlake Thrift, meanwhile, still was enjoying its boom period. Smith was in 
charge of the loan deals with Vladovich, and everything still looked good on 
paper. Vladovich usually made his payments on time, and Smith was receiving a 
large annual bonus for the loans that went through his office. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not exactly clear when Smith knew these were bad loan packages," a source 
said. "By 1986, however, he knew that Vladovich was making the payments. In 
early 1987, he demanded a meeting, and Vladovich said he wasn't buying the 48 
movies that were supposed to be part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Smith told him that if he missed a payment, the loans would be cut off. 
Vladovich said that if he did, they would go down together and Westlake would 
lose more than $1 million in outstanding loans," a source added. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that confrontation, the indictment filed in U. S. District Court shows 
that the loan arrangement continued through the first half of 1987. Smith, 
however, began to distance himself from Vladovich, no longer personally signing 
the checks to Pioneer Acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, state banking regulators had begun to look at other questionable 
loan practices by Westlake Thrift. The district attorney's office in Riverside 
County also had begun asking questions about Vladovich's business activities 
there. And, in July, 1987, a Westlake Thrift official named Chet Adams gained 
access to the Vladovich files and blew the whistle internally to other bank 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
There was, sources said, a last-minute scramble to contain the damage already 
done to Westlake Thrift, which involved the purchase of all of Vladovich's 
businesses by the bank and isolating everybody connected to Smith's operations. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake Thrift was under siege by this point, however. Not only had the FBI 
investigation into criminal fraud begun, but the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp. was beginning an inquiry of its own that eventually led to the forced 
closure of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's relationship with Vladovich effectively was ended. But the banker 
continued on a course that was destined to add to his future problems. In late 
1987, according to this month's indictment, he compounded his troubles by 
misappropriating $24,500 in bank funds, allegedly giving $5,000 to a female 
acquaintance in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
While Vladovich still faces trial, and Smith and the others indicted so far 
have not yet been sentenced, the guilty pleas by Smith and Vladovich's former 
sales force already have led some law enforcement agencies to view the 
investigation of Westlake Thrift as "a classic takedown" in a bank fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
From the earliest stages, the FBI's Ventura County office had only one 
white-collar crime specialist, Theodore J. Boler, assigned to the Westlake 
case. Boler pursued the Smith-Vladovich connections for almost two years before 
the indictments were returned. 
</P>
<P>
"Bank failure cases, particularly those resulting from fraud, are enormously 
difficult to investigate and prosecute," said Gary Auer, special agent in 
charge of the FBI's Ventura office. "However, there is always an audit trail 
available and records that do exist which eventually make prosecution 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
While the investigation has not yet ended, Auer said he thinks the Westlake 
Thrift probe has significance because of what it reveals about the broader 
problems now confronting savings and loan institutions throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"This case is a classic example of the kind of fraud that has taken place 
throughout the country," Auer said. "It shows that this is not just something 
that happens to people in other places, but can take place right here."

COUNTY TO RENEW HUNT FOR LANDFILL OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the proposed Weldon Canyon site for a new landfill under fire from Ojai 
residents and its environmental impact report delayed, the Ventura County 
Regional Sanitation District plans to reopen a countywide search for a 
different site. 
</P>
<P>
The Regional District board was to vote on the matter this morning, but General 
Manager Wayne Bruce said he expected to get the nod to return next month with a 
plan to begin the search, which is estimated to cost $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The thrust of the district's involvement is to procure a publicly owned site 
for a very long-term future," Bruce said. A private firm, Waste Management of 
California -- which also runs the Simi Valley Landfill -- holds the lease for 
the Weldon Canyon property. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce did not name alternative sites, but he said they would likely be 
distributed throughout the county instead of concentrated in the county's west 
end. He said a consultant's report should be completed late next summer. 
However, Bruce said that if the Weldon Canyon environmental impact report -- 
now expected in spring or summer 1990 -- shows that it is the ideal site, the 
district likely would rethink its plans. 
</P>
<P>
"Partly, it depends on whether there is a need for more than one landfill in 
the county and whether there is a need for both public and private," Bruce 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai environmentalists have protested a landfill at Weldon Canyon, based on the 
air pollution that daily truck traffic and heavy machinery would generate. 
</P>
<P>
The district's move to find a new site comes just as requirements of a new law 
take effect. That bill invalidates the county's 1985 Solid Waste Management 
Plan, which named Weldon Canyon as the county's next landfill site. The bill 
also provides for a committee of elected city and county representatives to be 
charged with deciding where landfills should be built. In the past, county 
government had that responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 solid waste plan examined 38 potential sites and narrowed the final 
cut to six. Those included five canyons north of Ventura along Highway 33, all 
of which would contribute to air pollution in the Ojai Valley. The sixth site, 
Aliso Canyon, is northeast of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal to search for a new site does not affect Waste Management of 
California or its plans to continue working toward permits for the landfill, a 
process with which it has been involved for five years. 
</P>
<P>
"They have their agenda and we believe in ours," said Jim Jevens, Weldon Canyon 
project manager for Waste Management. 
</P>
<P>
The company already has invested $5 million in the potential site, including 
costs of the lease and the extensive environmental impact report. That report, 
once expected in January, now is delayed until at least April, and possibly as 
late as summer 1990, Jevens said. 
</P>
<P>
Three factors contributed to the delay, Jevens said. The most serious 
consideration is environmental impacts on the Ojai Valley. Jevens said 
methanol-fueled garbage trucks and heavy equipment at the site are now being 
evaluated to reduce some of the anticipated pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The new legislation also added some time to the process. Among its provisions 
is a requirement for cities to reduce their wastes by 25% by 1995 and 50% by 
2000. That may mean that Weldon Canyon would need a recycling or recovery 
center, and its impacts will have to be studied. 
</P>
<P>
Third on the list of delaying factors is the availability of a site near Weldon 
Canyon. That site, Hammond Canyon, which is about five miles from Weldon Canyon 
along Canada Larga, was disqualified in 1985 because its owners did not want to 
sell. But the new owners are now interested, Jevens said. Part of the

CITY-SPONSORED CARE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica is a step closer to having its first city-sponsored child-care 
center. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council approved the construction contract and will begin to negotiate 
with the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District to see if the schools are 
interested in operating the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The $298,100 center is to house 52 youngsters during its operating hours at 
Marine Park. It will be open to city employees, residents near the park, and, 
if space is available, the public. 
</P>
<P>
It will be subsidized by the city at annual rate of between $131,231 and 
$183,695, so low-income city employees will be able to afford the services. 
Monthly fees for each youngster will be between $400 and $600, with $100 and 
$200 subsidies available for low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
The center will displace some community groups that used the park's facilities 
for meetings. The city staff is attempting to accommodate the groups at 
different parks, a staff member said.

POOL HALL OPEN 24 HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recently renovated Hollywood pool hall, which was forced to close between 2 
a.m. and 5 a.m. under a disputed police regulation, will once again be open 24 
hours a day after the Board of Police Commissioners acknowledged that the rule 
was in conflict with the city's Municipal Code. 
</P>
<P>
At a Tuesday meeting, the commission rescinded the ruling that forced Jeff Bey, 
owner of Hollywood Billiards, to restrict his business hours in November. "The 
nice thing about this ruling is that they did admit it had kind of slipped 
through the cracks," Bey said. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Municipal Code was amended in 1982 to allow pool halls and bowling 
alleys to remain open all night, the police regulations still stated that such 
businesses must close during early morning hours. Normally, such changes in the 
Municipal Code, are reflected in other regulations after a short period of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Bey took his case to the commission last month after the Hollywood vice squad 
cited him for remaining open 24 hours. Bey had recently completed a year-long 
renovation of the once-seedy pool hall and was entertaining guests at a grand 
reopening when officers informed him he could not remain open all night. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Billiards had traditionally been open during all hours, and Bey said 
he felt he was being singled out for punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Bey argued at several commission hearings that changes at the pool hall, 
including outside lights and security patrols, actually improved the 
drug-ridden corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue, and that a 
24-hour presence would discourage crime in the area.

BUYOUT SPARKS MOUNTAIN OF HOPE; 
</P>
<P>
MOUNTAINEERING: EMPLOYEES OF VENTURA-BASED ROCK-CLIMBING GEAR COMPANY CELEBRATE 
THEIR PURCHASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unlikely business deal involving outdoorsmen turned entrepreneurs, 
employees of a Ventura-based mountaineering gear company pulled together a few 
million dollars to buy out their employer, forming a new company without a 
day's break in production or sales. 
</P>
<P>
Former Chouinard Equipment employees, now 51%owners of the new company, Black 
Diamond, celebrated the deal's culmination with a bash at company offices in 
east Ventura on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very committed group of employees," said Peter Metcalf, the former 
general manager at Chouinard and now president and chief operating officer of 
Black Diamond. "We had to overcome a lot of problems to do this. I feel very 
fortunate we were able to pull it off." 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 20, the employees signed agreements with Lost Arrow, the parent company 
of Chouinard Equipment, Patagonia Inc. and other companies that manufacture 
outdoor clothing and gear. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 30 was Chouinard Equipment's last day of operations, and Black Diamond 
took over Dec. 1, Metcalf said. 
</P>
<P>
The buyout follows last spring's surprise bankruptcy filing by Chouinard 
Equipment. That move was designed to protect the deeper pockets of Lost Arrow 
from four lawsuits that claimed faulty instructions on the use of Chouinard 
Equipment products was responsible for injury to climbers. 
</P>
<P>
Lost Arrow has declined to comment on the suits. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Cegelski, an investment banker with a Los Angeles firm, helped 64 employees 
who had very little cash put together a deal to buy Chouinard Equipment's 
assets, which Metcalf said were between $2.5 million and $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Chouinard Equipment, which manufactures technical rock-climbing gear such as 
pitons, carabiners, ice axes and chocks, the wedge-shaped pieces used to help 
climbers secure their positions, had sales of $7 million in the last fiscal 
year, Metcalf said. 
</P>
<P>
Cegelski called the deal an unusual arrangement that came together in the nick 
of time. 
</P>
<P>
"Small firms like this generally don't survive a Chapter 11," said Cegelski, 
who was in Ventura for the celebration. "The first thing that usually happens 
is that employees start leaving. We were very fortunate to bring this to the 
table in seven months; frankly I don't know that the business would have 
survived much longer." 
</P>
<P>
The deal Cegelski developed after seven months of negotiations allowed 
employees to take money from their 401K retirement accounts and roll those 
accounts over into a fund that purchased stock in Black Diamond. Those 
employees who had extra money, like Metcalf, also bought stock directly in the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
That amounted to just over 50%, to give the employees the controlling interest. 
Black Diamond also sold stock to "like-minded" investors, such as Naoe 
Sakashita, who heads a company coincidentally called Lost Arrow Japan, which 
has no relation to the Ventura company. Sakashita, a mountain climber of world 
renown, according to Metcalf, contributed substantially. Michel Beal, a French 
manufacturer of ropes for Black Diamond, also bought in. 
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the sale price was financed by a loan, Metcalf said. 
</P>
<P>
Lost Arrow and Patagonia will buy equipment from Black Diamond to sell at its 
retail stores, as it did from its subsidiary, but now it will buy on a 
competitive basis, said Lost Arrow spokesman Kevin Sweeney. The Black Diamond 
company employees, many of whom are friends or spouses of Lost Arrow employees, 
are now on their own, Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a completely separate company," he said.

FILM SHOWN AS FUND-RAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of 800 needy children are going to go "Back to the Future" Saturday at 
a holiday movie screening of of the futuristic comedy's sequel. 
</P>
<P>
The children, selected from schools and homeless shelters in the Venice-Santa 
Monica area, will be greeted at the theater by Santa Claus, who will present 
them with a new toy, said Alison Dockray of the Venice Family Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"Back to the Future-Part II" actress Lea Thompson will be on hand to greet the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
The event is a fund-raiser for the Venice Family Clinic. A donation of $25 
sponsors one child, with proceeds going to the clinic's pediatric program, 
Dockray said. Last year's program raised $40,000 for the clinic, which has 
provided free care to the poor and homeless since 1970, including more than 
3,500 children this year. 
</P>
<P>
Universal Pictures, Amblin Entertainment and the Cineplex Odeon Corp. have 
donated the movie and the theater. 
</P>
<P>
The film will be shown Saturday morning at the Cineplex Odeon theater at Santa 
Monica's Third Street Promenade. 
</P>

DEMOLITION FEES CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has directed the city attorney to draft a measure that would 
levy fees on developers who demolish older, less expensive motels and hotels in 
the city's coastal zone. 
</P>
<P>
The fee would be about $8,000 per room demolished. The money would be used to 
build new affordable lodging with rooms going for about $57 a night. 
</P>
<P>
The state Coastal Commission already imposes such a fee for projects brought 
before it.

BEVERLY HILLS COUNCIL TO VOTE ON GRAFFITI LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An ordinance authorizing the public services director of Beverly Hills to 
combat graffiti on public and private structures was introduced at Tuesday's 
City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance calls for city crews to remove graffiti from city or public 
agency facilities within three working days of its appearance. It also would 
authorize the city to remove graffiti from private property between seven and 
14 days of sighting if the owner has not eliminated the graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bernard Hecht said: "We've had graffiti in 80 public locations since 
December of 1988. That's a lot for any city, and it's surprising to see it in 
our city." He added that there had been about 300 incidents of graffiti on 
private property in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
The council will vote on the ordinance Jan. 9.

DEVELOPER NOMINATED FOR PARK BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developer Peter Kyros, whose company's plans to build in the Santa Monica 
Mountains involve a crucial land swap with the National Park Service, is under 
consideration as a board member of a Park Service fund-raising auxiliary, 
officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Kyros has not been formally nominated to the board of the Santa Monica 
Mountains Parklands Assn., but his name has been suggested by David Gackenbach, 
superintendent of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and he 
attended the board's monthly meeting last Wednesday as an observer. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-member board is expected to make formal nominations before voting to 
replace two resigning members at a meeting Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the idea say Kyros, a general partner of Potomac Investment 
Associates, could be an ideal resource to the association, with the money and 
connections to help the foundering group meet its goals of acquiring and 
preserving parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Dennis Washburn said he favored Kyros' joining the board because 
he believed "the more cooperation with developers, the better." 
</P>
<P>
But critics say Kyros' membership on the board would present a conflict of 
interest because his plans for developing Jordan Ranch in eastern Ventura 
County require Park Service approval. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks to me to be more than a little collusive," said Jill Swift, outgoing 
association president. "This is just an example of what goes on behind the 
scenes." 
</P>
<P>
Margot Feuer, who was a member of the former advisory commission to the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, said, "I am really quite distressed 
about what I see as a major conflict of interest. The park service is dealing 
with this man on an exchange." 
</P>
<P>
Potomac Investment Associates of Maryland holds the option to buy Jordan Ranch, 
a 2,308-acre parcel of oak-dotted meadows and panoramic views just west of the 
Los Angeles County line. The property is owned by entertainer Bob Hope, who 
over the years has rejected proposals that he donate or sell all or part of the 
land to the Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
Potomac Investment wants to build 1,152 homes and a PGA Tournament golf course 
on the site, and crucial to those plans is a four-lane access road that would 
connect the development to the Ventura Freeway by cutting through Cheeseboro 
Canyon Park. 
</P>
<P>
The developer has proposed that the National Park Service swap 60 acres of 
parkland for the road in return for about 800 acres of Jordan Ranch, much of it 
in the upland meadow known as China Flat. 
</P>
<P>
Gackenbach's office is expected to make its recommendation on the trade to the 
Park Service's headquarters in Washington, sometime next fall or winter, after 
environmental impact reports have been completed and reviewed and the Ventura 
County Board of Supervisors votes on the project. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Gackenbach acknowledged that he proposed Kyros and 
several other developers as potential members of the association's board, 
mainly because the group has been unsuccessful in raising funds and could use 
patrons with clout. 
</P>
<P>
He said he made the suggestions at an October board meeting during a discussion 
of recruiting new members. He suggested that involvement with the parklands 
association could make developers "more attuned to what we're doing and what 
we're trying to accomplish," and help the national recreation area at a time 
when little federal money is available for acquiring and preserving parklands. 
</P>
<P>
But Gackenbach said that if Kyros' place on the board would generate 
controversy, he would not push it. 
</P>
<P>
Kyros said he would like to serve on the board if chosen, but that "the last 
thing I want to do is be in conflict or cause some internal controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"I really do believe the time has come for the private sector members who are 
the park's neighbors to come together and offer support for the park," Kyros 
said. "I feel I can help the park whether I am on the board or not." 
</P>
<P>
Kyros and Gackenbach said Kyros' presence on the board would present no 
conflict because the group's sole purpose is to raise funds for the mountain 
recreation area and has no authority over Park Service policies or decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Swift and other critics, however, noted that the parks superintendent attends 
most meetings, and that the association operates out of the national recreation 
area's headquarters in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Parklands Assn. was formed about three years ago, 
largely as a replacement for the dismantled Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area Advisory Commission.

TRAIL ADDS BEACH ACCESS IN SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A trail affording hikers and equestrians coastal access to approximately 65 
miles of trails weaving through the Santa Monica Mountains will open Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A dedication ceremony and guided one-mile hike and ride by the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy and Point Mugu State Park will celebrate the 11 a.m. 
opening at the Ray Miller Trailhead in La Jolla Canyon, about a mile south of 
Mugu Rock on U. S. Highway 1. 
</P>
<P>
The trail meanders through the mountains along the La Jolla Ridge at no more 
than a 9% incline and connects with several other paths, including the newly 
created Backbone Trail, park officials said. 
</P>
<P>
This large network of trails, traversing the "backbone" of the Santa Monica 
Mountains, stretches from Will Rogers State Historic Park in Pacific Palisades 
to Point Mugu State Park. Approximately 85% of the 65-mile Backbone Trail is 
completed, with the remaining 20 miles to be finished next year. 
</P>
<P>
Point Mugu State Park covers 15,000 acres from Newbury Park to Malibu. For more 
information, call the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy at (213) 456-5046.

VENTURA SCHOOLS TO GET HIGH-TECH DIESEL BUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN McALPINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura Unified School District has been chosen to participate in a 
statewide pilot program that officials hope will take the belch out of school 
buses, the sting out of fuel costs and better ensure the safety of California's 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura district was one of 11 chosen for the first phase of the California 
Energy Commission's demonstration program, which was designed largely to test 
alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
The district is to receive eight high-tech diesel buses and four 
methanol-powered buses by June, 1990, replacing 12 older buses built before 
federal safety standards took effect in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The district will get the buses, valued at $123,000 each, free under the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
According to district transportation director Steve Penney, the new diesel 
buses, equipped with state-of-the-art features such as computerized fuel 
injection, will be used as an experimental control to test the efficiency of 
the methanol-fueled buses. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be testing them one against the other for emissions and fuel economy," 
Penney said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the district next spring will apply for inclusion in the program's 
second phase, which will entail experimenting with other alternative fuels, 
including natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
A clean-burning fuel made from natural gas or coal, methanol has been used for 
more than a year by Ventura County in a fleet of eight specially equipped Ford 
Escorts. 
</P>
<P>
Their use has reduced pollutants, said Chuck Thomas, an air quality specialist 
with the county Air Pollution Control District. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had no troubles with the methanol components," said Thomas. "They work 
just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said the cars' only drawback is that they require special refueling 
centers. Additionally, methanol provides just half the mileage per gallon of 
conventional gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
There currently are two methanol refueling sites in the county -- one in 
Ventura, the other in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The first two phases of the program will cost $60 million. It has already been 
appropriated from the federal government's Petroleum Violation Escrow Account, 
a fund created from fines paid by oil companies that overcharged their 
customers. An additional $40 million for the third phase has yet to be 
approved.

DOCTORS FIND HOSPITAL OWNERSHIP IS POSSIBLE CURE TO HEALTH-CARE ILLS

Dr. Joe Valoria felt confident that he was onto a good investment when he 
joined about 60 other doctors to buy out the financially floundering Lark Ellen 
Hospital in West Covina in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"All the doctors were excited about the opportunity to own a hospital," said 
Valoria, vice chairman of the all-physician hospital board. 
</P>
<P>
"They were admitting about four patients a day in that hospital when we took 
over," said Dr. Jesse Umali, a key player in organizing the group. In the first 
quarter of this year, the facility, now called Covina Valley Community 
Hospital, has almost doubled that figure. The number of investors has grown as 
well, from about 60 to more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when large health-care chains are divesting themselves of less 
profitable facilities, doctors have bought or entered into joint-venture 
arrangements at four other hospitals in the San Gabriel Valley within the last 
two years. West Covina Hospital and AMI-Glendora Community Hospital were bought 
by local physician groups this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors are attracted by potential profit, as well as the opportunity to have 
more influence on decision-making, and hospitals value physicians as the source 
of a steady stream of patients. 
</P>
<P>
"Joint ventures are the current vogue," said Bob Joiner, general counsel for 
Paracelsus Healthcare Corp. of West Germany, which owns 76 hospitals worldwide. 
The firm sold West Covina Hospital to 20 doctors in November. In 1987, it gave 
up a 49% share of Monrovia Community Hospital to SGV Healthcare Services Inc., 
a physician group formed by Valoria. 
</P>
<P>
"Doctors are one of the primary customers in the business," Joiner said, 
referring to the patients they bring in. "They can make a significant financial 
impact" as partners. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, "physicians in the old days would order every battery of 
tests possible. Under today's environment, physicians have to say how many they 
really need." 
</P>
<P>
Also, doctors who used to order expensive drugs start looking harder at generic 
equivalents that work just as well, Joiner said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every physician would like their hospital to have the latest in technology," 
said Ken Rappoport, vice chairman of Nu-Med Hospitals Inc., a 14-hospital chain 
that signed a joint-venture agreement in 1988 with about 30 doctors at Terrace 
Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
But in a joint venture, when physicians select equipment, they are more 
interested in making sure that it will be used enough to justify the cost, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are more receptive to suggestions that can be cost effective and are more 
concerned about quality of care because (their own hospital) becomes the only 
facility they use," Rappoport said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Terrace Plaza agreement was signed, patient admissions are up 10% and 
"fairly lucrative" outpatient surgeries are up 20% at the 95-bed facility, said 
hospital spokesman David Watkins. "The patient mix has improved considerably, 
with more commercial and private insurance-holders than (those on) Medicare or 
Medi-Cal," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Rappoport said: "There are physicians practicing there who were not before. 
Clearly, doctors are influential in bringing in other physicians" and their 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
But the changes don't happen overnight. And for Valoria and his colleagues at 
Covina Valley, it wasn't smooth sailing for quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
Valoria, who became the chief of medical staff at the 76-bed facility, 
remembers the nightmare of regulatory problems that the new owners had to 
straighten out. The hospital had lost its accreditation from the Joint 
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations in 1977, the year 
before the doctors took over, because of serious violations. It was not 
reaccredited until 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"We almost closed right away," Valoria said. "We lost and lost and lost (money) 
until 1984," when the doctors reaped their first dividends. 
</P>
<P>
But from 1985 through 1988, he said, the eight general partners who had each 
invested $6,000 to $8,000 in the $3-million purchase received an average of 
$155,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very profitable," Valoria said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Washington-based Federation of American Health Systems, only 
8% to 12% of physicians nationwide have ownership interests in health-care 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
But in California, "20% of hospitals are physician-owned," said David Langness 
of the Hospital Council of Southern California, adding that the number has 
increased in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
The boom in buying and selling of hospitals in California has been fueled by 
higher real estate and health care costs, as well as competition among the 
large number of hospitals here, said DeAnne La Rue, also of the 230-member 
Hospital Council. 
</P>
<P>
A record number of California hospitals closed in 1988, Langness said, and 52% 
of the hospitals in the state lost money. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills-based American Medical International Inc., which had announced 
that it would close AMI-Glendora Community Hospital in November, signed an 
agreement that month to sell the 165-bed facility to a group of more than 50 
local doctors. Escrow is expected to close Jan. 7, said hospital board Chairman 
Bill Raymond. 
</P>
<P>
The sale illustrates the reversal of a trend in which doctors had been doing 
the selling, said AMI spokeswoman Suzanne Hovdey. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, we were buying hospitals from doctors," she said. When profits started 
declining, however, the firm, which owns more than 70 hospitals, started 
selling them off in 1985. "Today we look for smaller health-care chains or 
doctors" to sell to, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar Fauni, management consultant for Covina Valley, said: "The key of the 
future is a marriage between doctors and hospitals. Hospitals need physician 
involvement to give them the economic incentive." 
</P>
<P>
Paracelsus and Encino-based Nu-Med have entered into such marriages of 
convenience with physicians at Monrovia Community Hospital and Terrace Plaza, 
respectively. The chains report that doctors who are co-owners develop a 
greater respect for the economics of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
But critics of doctor investment in hospitals say it could create a conflict 
between what's best for the patient and what's best for the doctors' 
pocketbook. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Cave, senior health policy analyst at Mercer Meidinger Hansen Inc. in Los 
Angeles, an employee benefits consulting firm, warns that doctors could find it 
difficult to practice objectively if they have an ownership interest. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time a physician is involved in financing as well as care, tremendous 
conflict of interest could occur," Cave said. Physicians have always realized 
that there's a lot of money to be made in health care, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Cave also said a doctor-owner would have an incentive to refer patients to his 
hospital even though it "may not have best quality for a given procedure." 
</P>
<P>
But Dan Maier, a spokesman for the American Medical Assn., argues that 
physician-owned hospitals are more acutely aware of -- and more responsive to 
-- community needs than a large corporation. 
</P>
<P>
"There are obviously cases of abuse, but the majority are legitimate and 
improve health care," Maier said. "It's natural for physicians to invest back 
into medicine; they just need ethical guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
Federal anti-kickback laws prohibit direct reimbursement to physicians for 
patients they refer to hospitals in which they have a financial stake. In 11 
states, including California, doctors are required to disclose their investment 
interests to patients. 
</P>
<P>
The doctors see their investment as a way to gain some control over the 
facilities they practice in. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jarnail Gugga was among the 20 physicians who bought West Covina Hospital, 
renamed Doctors Hospital of West Covina. "We bought it because we were 
disappointed with the quality of care," he said. "Besides, we had no authority 
over there." 
</P>
<P>
Although previously Gugga rarely sent patients to West Covina Hospital, he said 
he expects that his entire hospitalization load of about 20 patients a month 
will be admitted there once he moves his offices to Doctors Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"We can exercise quality control better," Gugga said, adding that the response 
time of nurses is better because the doctors are there watching them. 
</P>
<P>
Umali, who also spearheaded the Terrace Plaza partnership, said the reduction 
of corporate red tape in a doctor-owned hospital is refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
"If doctors run (a facility) and want equipment and renovations, you just go to 
the board, make appropriations and you have it. That's the beauty of a small 
organization," he said. "Doctors feel at home at a hospital they own."

LYNN RANCH GATE PLAN SPARKS A WAR; 
</P>
<P>
LIFE STYLE: A PROPOSAL TO ENCLOSE THIS RUSTIC ENCLAVE HAS FEUDING NEIGHBORS 
HIRING ATTORNEYS -- AND SLAMMING DOORS AND TELEPHONES. 
</P>

<P>
Lynn Ranch in eastern Ventura County has long been cherished by residents as an 
old-fashioned rural refuge from suburban sprawl with acre-sized lots. But in 
the past year, a dispute over enclosing the ranch behind guarded gates has 
divided neighbors, embroiling them in the aggravations of modern life many 
sought to escape. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, this thing has really polarized residents so that you've got 
real zealots on both sides," said resident Bill Kannow. "We were a real nice, 
rural community before this. Now people are taking stands against each other." 
</P>
<P>
Pro- and anti-gating committees have retained lawyers and published arguments 
and rebuttals. Thousands of dollars have been spent on legal fees and a traffic 
study. Doors have been slammed and phones hung up during the debate. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the 640-house development, which lies in an unincorporated pocket 
of Ventura County within the city of Thousand Oaks, will vote today, Friday and 
Saturday on whether to build gates at three entrances off Lynn Road, hire 
private security guards and assume financial responsibility from the county for 
maintaining nearly 10 miles of streets. 
</P>
<P>
Although guarded entrances have become fashionable, Ventura County officials 
said the Lynn Ranch proposal is unusual because it involves an established 
neighborhood in which membership is not required, and owners do not share 
common property, such as a clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Grant Brimhall, city manager of Thousand Oaks and a resident of Lynn Ranch, 
said he knew of no other established development in the area that had added 
gates and guards. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Braitman, executive director of the Ventura County Local Agency 
Formation Commission, said the Lynn Ranch proposal was unprecedented in Ventura 
County for its proposed takeover of public streets by a private group. 
</P>
<P>
"I feet gating would close if off and keep it from being the open and pleasant 
place it is now," said Brimhall, an opponent who has lived in the community 
nearly 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Even if most of the property owners vote in favor of the gating proposal -- and 
a yearly assessment that would start at $600 per parcel and could annually 
increase -- the Ventura County Board of Supervisors still would have to approve 
the streets' conversion from public to private use. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the voting are not expected to be made public until later this month 
because absentee votes are being accepted through Dec. 24. 
</P>
<P>
The ranch's tradition of independence could make it more difficult for the 
gating plan to win approval. Because it was developed in phases by various 
builders, the ranch includes 12 different tracts, each with its own set of deed 
covenants and restrictions. To put the proposal before the county supervisors, 
more than a simple majority of residents is required -- a majority of each 
tract must vote in the proposal's favor. 
</P>
<P>
Gate proponents interviewed cited crime as the major reason for enclosing the 
ranch, although a brochure promoting the plan also touted enhanced property 
values and protection against annexation by Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Pro-gating activists Susan Pavlik and Barry Sweet, who fled the San Fernando 
Valley for Lynn Ranch, both said they have been victims of crime. Pavlik said 
her house was burglarized almost a year ago while her family slept. Sweet 
complained of an attempt to steal his son's truck and of vandals who destroyed 
his mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
"It may not sound like much," said Sweet. "But when you spend $100 for a 
hand-painted, wooden mailbox, it gets expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Concern about crime aside, a housing- and community-development specialist at 
UCLA's School of Architecture and Urban Planning offered a deeper reason for 
the gating trend. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to do with a growing sense of loss of control in general, and a growing 
sense of chaos," said Allan Heskin, an associate professor of urban planning. 
</P>
<P>
"The desire to have some order and some control in your life is basic. I think 
it's more than simply bigotry or fear of crime. Everything is getting bigger. 
Everything is susceptible to change. People don't feel protected anymore." 
</P>
<P>
But loss of control is why residents Caroline and Fred Howse oppose the gating 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, who bought their home in Lynn Ranch 27 years ago, said that under 
the proposal, a newly empowered homeowners association board of directors would 
be able to raise annual maintenance fees and levy emergency assessments. 
Membership in the homeowners association would become mandatory instead of 
voluntary, they added, and the association could be held liable if anyone were 
injured on the ranch's streets or horse trails. 
</P>
<P>
Caroline Howse said she was stunned when a fellow resident casually explained 
that if a property owner couldn't pay, "we'll just put a lien on their house 
and collect when they sell or die." 
</P>
<P>
Kannow, an attorney and relative newcomer to the ranch, said he can easily 
afford the assessments but opposes gating out of concern for longtime residents 
who are older and on fixed incomes. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people here bought their homes 25 years ago, before values went up and it 
was a relatively inexpensive place to buy," he said. "There's no guarantee 
against special assessments. . . . It's unfair." 
</P>
<P>
Developed before Thousand Oaks became a city 25 years ago, Lynn Ranch is an 
island of 538 acres, surrounded by Thousand Oaks. Residents would like to keep 
it that way. Last year, a majority voted against annexation, despite the 
arguments of Ventura and Thousand Oaks officials that government services would 
improve without additional cost.

DEVELOPER FINED $47,000 FOR HIDING CAMPAIGN FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fair Political Practices Commission on Tuesday imposed a record fine of 
$47,000 against Griffin Homes for making campaign contributions through its 
employees and failing to disclose itself as the source of the money. 
</P>
<P>
The penalty, approved by a 4-0 vote, represents the largest fine by the 
commission in its 14-year history for violations involving hiding or 
"laundering" campaign contributions, spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. 
</P>
<P>
One of Southern California's largest developers, Griffin Homes had originally 
agreed to pay $26,500 in a proposed settlement of its case with the 
commission's staff. 
</P>
<P>
Its violations, according to the commission, included 22 laundered campaign 
contributions totaling $3,280, which were made between 1985 and 1988 to 
candidates including Moorpark Councilman Bernardo Perez and Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
But at its meeting last month, the commission rejected that fine as too low and 
characterized the builder's violations as "very serious." Commission chairman 
John Larson later said, "I'm sick and tired of the developers buying city 
councils. We've got to make a stand." 
</P>
<P>
The higher fine was adopted Tuesday without comment, Michioku said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Griffin Homes, sales and marketing vice president Marion 
Kiesling, said in a prepared statement that the company had "worked diligently 
and expeditiously with the state Fair Political Practices Commission to get 
this matter behind us." 
</P>
<P>
"While the amount of the contributions was small, only $3,280, we recognize the 
importance of upholding the regulations of the Fair Political Practices 
Commission and agree to pay the fine levied against Griffin Homes." 
</P>
<P>
The commission released its findings against the Calabasas builder in a report 
issued Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the recipients of the contributions generally did not 
know that Griffin Homes had supplied the money. An exception was Antonovich, 
who last year accepted $300 from a man he later learned was a Griffin employee, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's investigation found that Perez received five contributions of 
$99 each during an unsuccessful bid for the Moorpark City Council in 1987. At 
the time, the report noted, Griffin Homes was seeking permits from the Moorpark 
City Council to build 494 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Perez has denied knowing the source of the money.

JAMES CLAIMS FORMER POST AS COACH AT VENTURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF RILEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlike many coaches, Dick James does not believe that the Division I level 
always provides the best of coaching opportunities in college football. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore James, Ventura College's only head football coach in the 1970s, 
decided to forgo the big time at Stanford for the chance to return to Ventura 
last year as an assistant. And, after Phil Passno resigned last week, James 
reclaimed the head coaching position he left in 1979 to become Stanford's 
offensive line coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I have mixed emotions," James said. "I've been in this business long enough to 
see some very fine coaches step down, and that is difficult. But I'm also happy 
with the opportunity to lead a program." 
</P>
<P>
James led the Pirates to a 58-40 record and two Western State Conference 
championships from 1970-79 before moving on to Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great opportunity to get into the next level of coaching," James said 
of his ascension to the major-college ranks. "At the time, it was the right 
thing to do because you want to grow and develop professionally." 
</P>
<P>
James, 49, was Stanford's offensive line coach until 1983 and was the 
recruiting coordinator from 1983-87. He has worked with such players as John 
Elway, Darrin Nelson, and Brad Muster, all of whom play in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm grateful of those opportunities," James said. "I really enjoyed working 
with such quality people." 
</P>
<P>
James, however, did not enjoy his administrative position as recruiting 
coordinator, much less the hectic schedule and its attendant frequent-flier 
mileage. 
</P>
<P>
"I see myself as a teacher and a coach, and it was evident after five years of 
administrative work that I wanted to get back on the field," James said. "It 
was a chance to come home." 
</P>
<P>
James did that, taking over last season as Ventura's offensive coordinator. He 
was the offensive line coach this season, but when Passno resigned Dec. 4 after 
leading Ventura to a 7-4 record and its second bowl-game berth in seven years, 
James was immediately promoted. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked strictly at him," Ventura Athletic Director Jerry Dunlap said. "We 
wanted continuity in the program." 
</P>
<P>
James has already begun visiting high schools, organizing his coaching staff 
and developing strength and fitness programs. He said that he would have been 
content as an assistant but is pleased to again be in charge of a program. 
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoy the community and the level of football," he said. "There are 
some constructive things you can do to help at this level." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura won two WSC championships during Passno's tenure and won a 
school-record seven consecutive games at the start of this season. Passno, who 
was 38-33 at Ventura, will remain on the physical education staff and might 
continue to coach football if a position is appealing to him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm at a point in my career when I'm not interested in just doing anything," 
Passno said.

DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN ARRESTED IN CHURCH BURGLARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A young man was arrested in La Crescenta Tuesday night in connection with a 
burglary that may have been part of a series of break-ins at churches in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Police declined to give any details about the suspect or even to say exactly 
where he was arrested. His arrest resulted from the investigation of a burglary 
at a Montrose church in September. 
</P>
<P>
"He was traced through fingerprints that were found at the scene in Montrose," 
said Detective Jerry Starks of the Crescenta Valley Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The series of burglaries has involved vandalism, theft and, in one instance, 
arson. 
</P>
<P>
Thefts in the series occurred on Sept. 20 at the Church of the Nazarene in 
Montrose, on Oct. 23 at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in La 
Crescenta, on Oct. 28 at St. Bede's Church in La Canada Flintridge, on Nov. 25 
at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in La Canada Flintridge, and 
on Dec. 5 at the First Baptist Church in La Crescenta. 
</P>
<P>
Office machines, cash or both were taken from each of the churches involved. A 
fire was also set at St. Bede's, causing an estimated $5,000 in damage to the 
office, authorities said.

If The Times' 1989 Ventura County all-star team could take the field in the 
sameuniform . . . 
</P>
<P>
The team would reflect the defensive strength of the Marmonte League and the 
offensive explosiveness of the Channel League. Frontier League champion Santa 
Clara would play a major role and surprising Fillmore of the Tri-Valley League 
would contribute. 
</P>
<P>
The offense would specialize in a drop-back passing attack with quarterbacks 
Tim Gutierrez of Santa Clara and Jason Isaacs of Buena at the controls. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez is the county's all-time leading passer and ranks fifth on the 
all-time state list for passing yardage. The two-time all-county selection led 
Santa Clara to the Division VIII semifinals by completing 210 of 334 passes for 
2,939 yards and 18 touchdowns. Despite playing behind an inexperienced 
offensive line, Isaacs rewrote Buena's passing records, completed 143 of 244 
for 1,961 yards and eight touchdowns. Gutierrez threw only nine interceptions 
and Isaacs threw only 10. 
</P>
<P>
Several receivers could be sent out at once on patterns because the interior 
line would pass block so well. 
</P>
<P>
And what receivers they would be: Shawn Young of Channel Islands is the 
county's premier deep threat, averaging 24 yards a catch and scoring six 
touchdowns in a run-oriented offense. Tony Williams of Buena gets open quickly 
and runs well after he catches the ball. Williams, Buena's leading receiver 
while playing running back, had 44 catches for 540 yards and three touchdowns. 
He would fare well on a reverse as well, having rushed for 725 yards on 104 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
The running game would be explosive outside the tackles and powerful on 
short-yardage situations. In addition to the versatile Kwinn Knight of Santa 
Clara and the prolific Danny Taylor of Ventura, the team's kicker, Tory Cabral 
of Fillmore, and several players on the defense are also excellent running 
backs. 
</P>
<P>
Knight is the best ever in the county at finding the end zone, having scored 33 
touchdowns and four two-point conversions for 206 points. He rushed for 911 
yards in 140 carries and had 62 receptions for 660 yards. Taylor shattered 
school records while rushing for 1,554 yards in 226 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Cabral, the only junior on the first-team offense, helped Fillmore into the 
second round of the Division IX playoffs by rushing for a county-high 1,555 
yards in 188 carries. The junior scored 16 touchdowns, made 28 of 30 
point-after kicks and two of four field-goal tries for 130 points. 
</P>
<P>
The runners would be ushered by five tremendous offensive linemen. Two of them, 
Tim Dowler of Oxnard and Ted Lawrence of Santa Clara, are centers. The others, 
Joe Smigiel of Newbury Park, Reggie Nelinger of Thousand Oaks and Matt Eckman 
of Ventura, are tackles. Any of them, however, could make the adjustment needed 
to play guard. All are quick enough to fire out and catch a piece of a 
linebacker as well as powerful enough to turn a defensive lineman away from the 
hole through which a back is running. 
</P>
<P>
Dowler, a three-year starter, has teamed with Oxnard quarterback Johnel Turner 
since their youth football days. Lawrence, who also played youth football with 
his current quarterback, Gutierrez, exhibited exceptional leadership as well as 
consistent play. 
</P>
<P>
Smigiel and Nelinger, both team captains, specialize in pulling and leading 
backs downfield with devastating run blocks. Smigiel also scored two touchdowns 
on a tackle-counter play. Eckman, a two-way player, was the blocker Taylor ran 
behind for his toughest yards. 
</P>
<P>
If the all-star defense was able to take the field, not many introductions 
would have to be made. Only five teams are represented on the unit and Marmonte 
League champion Thousand Oaks boasts five first-team defenders. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Foster and Nick Ochoa of Thousand Oaks and Jeff Jay of Newbury Park are 
linemen, but all three are exceptionally quick and athletic. Jay, the Marmonte 
League Defensive Player of the Year, is a nose tackle who can beat a center at 
his own snap. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa, who led Thousand Oaks with 18 sacks, plays with a ferocious intensity. 
Foster, another emotional player, beats opposing linemen with a fast start and 
great leverage. Foster is also a bowling ball of a fullback who rushed for 531 
yards and led the Lancers with 13 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Martin of Thousand Oaks, the Marmonte League Player of the Year, leads a 
versatile linebacking corps that includes outside linebacker Bryant Taylor of 
Oxnard, Ryan Turner of Newbury Park and Scott Foster of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, a two-time all-county pick with enormous strength and deceptive speed, 
paced the Lancers in tackles from his middle linebacker position. 
</P>
<P>
The other three are rangy outside linebackers. Taylor can cover from sideline 
to sideline and is also a fine pass defender. In 10 games, the repeat 
all-county selection also rushed for 1,436 yards and 15 touchdowns in 228 
carries as the fullback in the Oxnard wishbone. 
</P>
<P>
Turner was the Panthers' big-play defender, and his interception in the fourth 
quarter of a playoff victory over Palos Verdes set up the winning touchdown. 
Foster, who also stars on the basketball court for Camarillo, is a rugged 
player equally adept at rushing the passer and defending the run. 
</P>
<P>
The secondary is highlighted by two repeat selections, Steve Rudisill of 
Thousand Oaks and Johnel Turner of Oxnard. Rounding out the defense are Tim 
Ross of Royal, the unit's only junior, and Jim Magallanes, a cornerback who 
proved difficult to beat. 
</P>
<P>
Rudisill, last year's Marmonte League Defensive Player of the Year, was a savvy 
member of a Thousand Oaks defense that posted five shutouts. His pass coverage 
and sure tackles from free safety prevented big plays. Rudisill, who had five 
interceptions, also played running back. 
</P>
<P>
Turner, who played safety and quarterback for Oxnard, is one passer who loves 
to hit. He enjoys defense more than offense, even though he scored 18 
touchdowns and rushed for 748 yards. He had three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Magallanes, a cornerback who loves to go after the ball, tied for the county 
lead with seven interceptions. He also played wide receiver and scored seven 
touchdowns on receptions and reverses. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, also a safety, is a second-year starter who is one of several talented 
Highlander underclassmen. He served as center fielder in the pass coverage, 
leading the team with four interceptions -- including one for a touchdown -- 
and is Royal's finest tackler.

AUTO SHOP CLEANS CARS TO THE LAST DETAIL; 
</P>
<P>
LIFE STYLE: STARTING WITH A MODEL A FORD, DETAILER BILL LARZELERE TURNED HIS 
ELBOW GREASE INTO A FULL-TIME CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Though some may view it as an exercise in redundancy, when Gene McCabe buys a 
new car, he takes it to Bill Larzelere's auto detailing shop to be cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
Larzelere is known as an ultra detailer. "A brand-new car looks like a piece of 
junk until Bill gets done with it," said McCabe, owner of Gene McCabe 
Productions, a Burbank film company. "He does a better job cleaning cars than 
most people do dressing themselves." 
</P>
<P>
"We even polish the backside of the gas and clutch pedals," said Larzelere, who 
opened his shop in 1975. "Car show judges look behind things, so for us it's a 
matter of covering 100% of the vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
A variety of polishes and preservatives are applied to a car's upholstery and 
dashboard, but Lemon Pledge furniture polish is Larzelere's favorite. Chrome 
and aluminum parts are buffed with a fine-grade steel wool. A car's underside 
also is cleaned, using plain soap and water. 
</P>
<P>
Larzelere said his patience for such work comes from a boyhood spent watching 
his father fix and restore race cars and boats. "Dad was kind of a 
perfectionist," Larzelere said. "Everything had to be right. There was never a 
compromise, never a thought of a cheaper part or an easier way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
To gain his father's recognition, Larzelere began assembling his own cars: 
first a Model A Ford at the age of 14 and later a 1941 Packard. As a teen-ager, 
he cleaned hot rods raced by high school seniors in exchange for borrowing the 
cars on dates. He eventually turned his elbow grease into a full-time career, 
working out of his home before opening his Burbank shop. 
</P>
<P>
After detailing a car's interior, Larzelere grinds out imperfections in 
exterior paint surfaces with fine-grade sandpaper. "See this paint?" he asked, 
pressing his face against the sparkling red hood of a 1955 Jaguar XK-140. "It's 
full of craters, pits and dirt. But to most people, it looks like a great paint 
job." 
</P>
<P>
Believing that cotton used in diapers is too rough for car surfaces, Larzelere 
prefers a cotton similar to that used in sanitary napkins to apply compounds, a 
hand glaze and, finally, carnauba wax. 
</P>
<P>
The waxing and polishing process is accomplished in eight steps, using short, 
cross-hatch and perpendicular strokes to apply the solutions. A portable 
fluorescent light is used to check for imperfections along the way. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill has a relationship with paint like nobody else," said Bruce Meyer, owner 
of Geary's, a seller of fine crystal, china and silver in Beverly Hills. Meyer 
hands over his 1930 Duesenberg and 1934 Packard to Larzelere before entering 
such car shows as the Concours d'Elegance held annually in Pebble Beach. "He 
knows exactly the right amount of pressure to apply almost by instinct," Meyer 
said, adding that some car owners spend from $10,000 to $40,000 for a paint job 
before taking it to Larzelere for polishing. 
</P>
<P>
The entire detailing process takes about 20 hours for an average car and from 
30 to 150 hours for a show car. The record was a needy Ferrari Daytona Spyder 
convertible, which took 1,200 hours, said Larzelere, who details about 10 cars 
each month, charging customers from $22 to $35 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Part-time help is hired during hectic periods, and Barbara, Larzelere's wife, 
does the shop's accounting, handles job estimates for potential customers and 
other minute tasks, such as handpainting emblems on Porsche hubcap ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
Larzelere prefers to have an unlisted telephone number since he is constantly 
overbooked because of customer referrals. The two-bay shop lies just beyond a 
faceless concrete wall, where cars in various states of assembly are scattered 
about -- all covered with dual jackets of plastic and canvas. 
</P>
<P>
Like most automotive shops, disorder is everywhere: Orphaned parts are piled up 
in corners, and stacks of paper work cover desks beneath framed photographs of 
antique cars. Three mutts, Shelby, Alice and Faith, lounge on worn carpeting, 
watching Larzelere as he inspects the finish on a 1973 Ferrari Daytona coupe's 
alternator. 
</P>
<P>
Opening several lockers packed with supplies, Larzelere reviewed the contents. 
Among them was an eight-ounce jar of carnauba wax, priced at $99.95. "It's 
quite good," Larzelere said, taking a whiff of the mixture, which was signed 
and numbered. "But it's hard to live with at that price." 
</P>
<P>
Perfectionist car owners who frequent his shop are known as "clean freaks," 
Larzelere said, admitting that the whole ball of car wax sometimes gets out of 
hand. A well-known Hollywood producer-director routinely inspects his car when 
picking it up from Larzelere, pointing out the difference between parts cleaned 
by Larzelere and those cleaned by the shop's assistants. "I made the mistake of 
letting him look at the car when it was up on the hoist," Larzelere said. "He 
saw some dirt around a bolt and said, 'Are you slipping, or is someone else 
working on this?' "

CANDY CANE LANE; 
</P>
<P>
EACH CHRISTMAS, A WEST VALLEY NEIGHBORHOOD GLOWS WITH GOOD CHEER AND MASSIVE 
WATTAGE

<P>
Asmall neighborhood, tucked beside the freeway in Woodland Hills, considers 
itself special. Newcomers are informed, before they move in, about "the 
tradition." 
</P>
<P>
So, on the first Friday in December, Rosemarie Rush was working in her front 
yard, winding silver garlands around the fence post, hanging colored lights. 
</P>
<P>
Rush recently moved into "Candy Cane Lane," an otherwise ordinary neighborhood 
that is famous for its lavish Christmas decorations. For 37 years, most of the 
houses in the area -- two blocks long and four blocks wide -- have joined in 
the holiday festooning. 
</P>
<P>
And in the weeks before Christmas, carloads of onlookers jam the streets as 
police direct traffic. People come to see the Model T hitched to a sleigh on 
Lubao Avenue, or the 19-foot-tall Santa Claus on Oakdale Avenue. They come to 
see lighted bells along Jumilla Avenue. On Penfield Avenue, the Pillar family 
has strung up $2,000 worth of lights, and a jukebox on the front lawn plays 
Elvis Presley's "Blue Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Candy Cane Lane has seen a lot of changes in four decades. Residents have died 
or moved away. But the tradition perseveres. 
</P>
<P>
"The people we bought this house from told us about it," said Rush, 53, trying 
to bring her yard up to snuff. "If you want to buy a house in this 
neighborhood, you buy into all the decorating." 
</P>
<P>
The six blocks that make up Candy Cane Lane lie directly south of Oxnard Street 
and west of Corbin Avenue. It is an upper-middle-class neighborhood of large 
homes on flat, half-acre lots. Many of the residents are in their 50s or 60s 
and have lived there 20 or 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
They tell stories of how it all began, in 1952, when some housewives cooked 
this scheme up in their kaffeeklatsch. Husbands were enlisted. 
</P>
<P>
"We all worked together," said Kip Northcross. "If someone needed something cut 
out of wood, they would go to the man down the street or to my husband, who had 
a band saw. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone pretty much went along with it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Each street was given a theme. Jumilla was Avenue of the Bells, and Oakdale was 
Candlelight Lane. Lubao was Candy Cane Lane, and Penfield was Caroler's Way. 
Winnetka Avenue was originally included but never participated much "because 
that street's just too busy," said Norm Murdaugh, 68, who lives on Jumilla. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish families who lived on these blocks put up blue and white lights and 
large menorahs. 
</P>
<P>
There were, and still are, other Los Angeles neighborhoods that decorate en 
masse. But Candy Cane Lane soon established itself as a premier holiday 
attraction in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The tradition peaked in the 1950s and '60s. It has faltered some since then. 
Among the original residents still alive and residing in the neighborhood, 
several said they are getting too old to put up extensive decorations. A 
majority of the homeowners still decorate, but not all the newcomers have 
joined the Christmas activities. 
</P>
<P>
And in the past couple of years, vandals have come late at night to tear down 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
None of this has stopped sightseers. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets more and more popular every year," said Sgt. Dennis Zine of the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic Bureau. "The traffic is phenomenal. 
It's one constant stream of cars." 
</P>
<P>
Retailers say that outside Christmas lights are coming back into vogue (see 
accompanying story on page N10). At Builders Emporium stores, sales have 
increased significantly over the past couple of years, said Carolyn Jacinto, a 
buyer for the chain. 
</P>
<P>
Murdaugh says that along Candy Cane Lane, people leave notes in the mailboxes, 
thanking residents for the decorations. 
</P>
<P>
So the people of this neighborhood keep at it. There is talk of a resurgence, 
of another era when absolutely every house will be decorated. 
</P>
<P>
The younger generation is taking the lead. Kip Northcross' son brings his 
children to decorate her house. On Jumilla Avenue, 22-year-old Tim Lopez 
struggles to erect the huge Santa his father bought 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a knee operation, so now I do it," Lopez said. "I always loved 
Christmastime here. It was like having Disneyland at home." 
</P>
<P>
And there are people like the Pillars, who moved to Penfield a little over a 
year ago. They have spared neither cost nor wattage in assembling what has 
quickly become recognized as one of Candy Cane Lane's most spectacular yards. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to keep putting up more lights," said Beau Pillar, whose wife's 
name is Cande. 
</P>
<P>
"We want everyone around here to get excited," he said. "We want to make Candy 
Cane Lane better than it ever was."

It happened 43 years ago, but Nicholas Royce is not about to forget the day he 
was inducted into the Army at Ft. Mead outside Baltimore. That was the day he 
learned about the tri-faith syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you Catholic, Protestant or Jewish?" the induction officer asked him. 
"None of them," Royce responded. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him I was Greek Orthodox," he recalled, "but the officer kept insisting 
that I had to fit into one of the three categories because that was all they 
recognized. Or I could be classified as an 'other.' That really irked me. 
</P>
<P>
"Eastern Orthodox Christians had died in World War II in defense of the 
Constitution, yet here we were being denied our constitutional rights of 
freedom of religion." 
</P>
<P>
By his own admission Royce, a 63-year-old former professional dancer turned 
film distribution executive, takes any slight of his religion as a personal 
affront. But the North Hollywood resident does far more than just stew over his 
hurts. 
</P>
<P>
His Army experience prompted him to start a nine-year lobbying effort that 
ended in 1955 when the Pentagon agreed to permit Orthodox Christians to have 
their own chaplains and official classification. Church leaders say Royce's 
effort also prompted Dwight D. Eisenhower to invite an Orthodox archbishop to 
participate in his 1957 presidential inauguration, the first time such an 
invitation had been extended. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Royce has engaged in a nonstop, one-man campaign to raise public 
awareness and gain official recognition for Orthodox Christianity. He continues 
to pester politicians into giving Orthodox clergy equal time at ceremonial 
occasions, arranges for Orthodox representatives to appear on radio and 
television religion talk shows and makes sure that Orthodox viewpoints are 
included in interfaith activities. 
</P>
<P>
He cajoles and, he also admits, sometimes annoys. But he's also persistent and 
his efforts have gained him wide recognition within his church and the 
interfaith community as well. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was not for Nick, Orthodoxy really wouldn't be recognized in the United 
States. His work has been to that extent," said the Rev. James T. Adams, dean 
of St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Los Angeles. "Nick gave the church 
visibility before anyone else in the church was even aware of the need for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
"Nick is my connection with the religious Greek community," added Robert M. 
Jones, Southern California regional executive director for the National 
Conference of Christians and Jews. "He's an excellent champion of his faith in 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
Royce works independently of his church's hierarchy. He holds no official 
position and receives no financial support from the church, even though he said 
that each year he spends "several thousand dollars" of his money on behalf of 
his faith. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to work alone," he said. "You have to satisfy too many people if you 
work on committees. That's why I could never be a priest." 
</P>
<P>
Royce's outspokenness is also directed at his church, which he believes is 
stuck in its ethnic past, and reluctant to accommodate American mores and face 
the social problems of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"Orthodoxy needs to be made relevant if it is to satisfy the real spiritual 
needs of our thoroughly Americanized congregants," he said. "Having a bishop 
look great in beautiful vestments isn't enough. He's got to be streetwise. 
</P>
<P>
"Our clergy believe in apostolic succession. So let them start to act like 
apostles and mix with the people." 
</P>
<P>
Statements like that have earned Royce the status of "church gadfly," said 
Andrew T. Kopan, a professor of education at De Paul University in Chicago and 
a founder of Orthodox Christian Laity, a national body of lay Orthodox. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't go through formal channels, and that doesn't endear you to the 
conservative elements in the church," Kopan said. "There are some members of 
the hierarchy who see Nick as a threat because he demands accountability." 
</P>
<P>
Despite that, Royce was awarded Greek Orthodoxy's highest honor accorded to lay 
people. In 1985, he traveled to New York where Archbishop Iakovos, the highest 
Greek Orthodox official in the Western Hemisphere, personally bestowed upon 
Royce the rank of Archon of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of the Order of St. 
Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
Royce, slightly built, white-haired and passionate when talking about his 
church, was born in Bethlehem, Pa., where his Greek immigrant parents ran a 
restaurant. When he was 6, the family moved to Baltimore and it was there that 
he encountered ethnic and religious prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a lot of 'Go back to Greece,' yet I was born in America. It tore me 
apart and I went home crying a lot," Royce said. "But my reaction to this was 
to immerse myself in the Greek Orthodox religion and Greek culture." 
</P>
<P>
Greek Orthodoxy is the largest of the various independent national branches of 
Eastern Orthodox Christianity that have taken root in the United States, 
accounting for about 40% of the nation's 5 million Orthodox believers (others 
include Russian, Ukrainian, Antiochian and Serbian Orthodox church members). 
</P>
<P>
About three-fourths of Southern California's 200,000 Orthodox Christians belong 
to the Greek church. 
</P>
<P>
Orthodox Christians, whose church split with Western Christianity in the 11th 
Century over political and theological differences, consider theirs the true 
church of the early apostles. Known for its incense-filled rituals and the 
beauty of its icons (painted images of Christ and the saints), Orthodoxy is a 
conservative faith bound in Old World traditions. 
</P>
<P>
Royce, however, is anything but traditional. 
</P>
<P>
Taught to dance by his older sister, he turned professional at age 14, despite 
family fears that show business would drain him of his culture and religion. 
"That's a problem we have in the Greek Orthodox world," he said. "There's a 
real fear that assimilation means the end for us as a people. I'm a perfect 
example of how untrue that is." 
</P>
<P>
Royce was known as "the Greek Fred Astaire in GI clothing" when the Army sent 
him on tours of military hospitals and bases. He appeared in nightclubs and 
theaters around the country with his own group, specializing in jazz and 
calypso dancing, and on the Ed Sullivan, Milton Berle and Kate Smith television 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
He settled in Los Angeles in the mid-1950s, ended his dancing career in 1960 
and tried banking and hosting TV and radio talk shows before going into film 
distribution. He works in Hollywood for a religious film production company. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after moving here, he also took on the self-appointed task of shaking up 
his church when he realized his own spiritual needs were unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted a church that was there for me seven days a week, not just on Sunday. 
I needed a forward-looking church that responded to issues and wasn't just a 
cocoon for immigrants," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, he noticed that Orthodoxy never seemed to be mentioned 
in the popular media. "Having been in show business, I knew the value of 
publicity," Royce said. "Since no one else was doing it, I just started 
contacting the media and sending out press releases and letters." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, though, neither the Greek or any of the other Orthodox churches 
had official public relations representatives. Not knowing who else to call, 
media people got in the habit of calling Royce. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, I wasn't your typical passive priest," he explained. "I was outspoken 
and the media likes that. So they kept calling. Some of the clergy got quite 
upset with me. They said, 'Who is he to do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
"Nick was sort of a legend in the church back in the '50s," Kopan said in a 
telephone interview from Chicago. "Before there was any organized public 
relations for the church, Nick was speaking or writing about Orthodoxy to 
anybody who would listen." 
</P>
<P>
Royce's prime concerns within his church revolve around what he sees as the 
need for a "good" English translation of the Greek Orthodox liturgy and his 
upset over "unimaginative" responses to such pressing social issues as 
interfaith marriages, AIDS, the homeless, drugs, nuclear weapons and the role 
of women. 
</P>
<P>
"The church has a moral duty to participate in solving social problems," Royce 
said. "I'd like to see some of our bishops work in a soup kitchen and visit 
hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
"Nick believes the Orthodox churches should come right out with positions on 
social issues like other faiths often do," said St. Sophia's Father Adams. "He 
believes the church is too slow to respond, and sometimes he is right." 
</P>
<P>
Royce also is involved in an international effort on behalf of the Orthodoxy's 
spiritual leader, Archbishop Dimitrios I, the Ecumenical Patriarch of 
Constantinople (Istanbul). Orthodox officials have charged Muslim Turkey with 
harassing the archbishop, and Royce has fired off hundreds of letters to heads 
of state and international organizations in an attempt to pressure the Turkish 
government into allowing the archbishop more freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"This may be his greatest contribution to the church," said Nikki 
Stephanopoulos, chief spokesperson in New York for the Greek Orthodox 
Archdiocese of North and South America. "Nicholas was way ahead of everybody in 
getting people to understand the situation." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of Royce's causes involve his religion, however. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, he became the first man to be accepted as a member of Women 
in Film, the third entertainment industry women's organization to grant him 
full membership. The others were American Women in Radio &amp; TV (Royce was 
the first male to serve on the board of the Southern California chapter) and 
the Hollywood Women's Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that women are being accepted in formerly all-male organizations, Royce 
said he is simply doing his bit to demonstrate that turnabout is fair play. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been an activist and maybe I'm a feminist. Besides, women have 
helped me during my life and I think I can help them by participating in their 
organizations," he said.

ASK THE VET: TENACITY NEEDED IN TREATING FELINE ACNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: My question is about a condition my cat has on her chin, namely little brown 
flakes. This started during the flea season last September. I just assumed the 
condition was caused by fleas. I was told it had to do with the hair follicles, 
too much oil. 
</P>
<P>
She was given an antibiotic and the following treatment prescribed: shampoo the 
area twice a day with Pyoben Gel shampoo, soak for 10 minutes, rinse thoroughly 
with fresh water, towel dry and then swab with rubbing alcohol. The treatment 
started Sept. 29 and continued through Oct. 6. The condition improved somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
I was told to continue the treatment once a day, which I have done every day 
since Oct. 6 and am continuing to do so. There is some improvement, some days 
no flakes and then they come back again. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a treatment you can recommend for this condition other than the above? 
Also, I was told plastic dishes can be the source of this condition. My cat has 
never used plastic dishes, only stainless steel. Her food is Science Diet 
Feline Maintenance for the past two years, and she is an indoor cat. 
</P>
<P>
Henriette King, San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
A: I certainly admire your tenacity and thoroughness in treating your cat's 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Such a condition is commonly called feline acne, although it is not related to 
the human condition. There are generally comedones or "black heads" on the chin 
and lower lips. The cause of the syndrome is not completely understood and 
varies from chronic skin disease to contact with irritants, such as a plastic 
bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Treatment of uncomplicated cases is exactly as you describe, cleaning the area 
with a keratolytic shampoo and the use of astringents such as benzoyl peroxide. 
Alcohol can become very irritating to the skin with long-term use. If the 
comedones become secondarily infected, antibiotics and hot packing of the area 
may help. 
</P>
<P>
It is unfortunate the recurrence of the acne is most common and such 
maintenance treatment is necessary. It would be beneficial to do some skin 
scrapings to rule out the possibility of a dermal parasite. A skin biopsy may 
be helpful in locating any secondary conditions or causes for the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Q: In the past two months, my cat has been vomiting his food within a few hours 
of eating. He tends to vomit the canned food more than the dry. 
</P>
<P>
I have tried several varieties of canned food, but he still seems to have 
problems keeping it down. The dry food doesn't seem to bother him as much. 
</P>
<P>
Should I stop the canned food and feed him only dry? Is there any medicine I 
can give him to help keep him from vomiting? 
</P>
<P>
Loren Baccus, Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
A: Your cat is apparently sensitive to the canned food, and medication may not 
help improve this situation. Canned foods may be too "rich" for him or he may 
have some difficulty in digesting the fats. 
</P>
<P>
You might try to make a list of canned foods that he is able to eat without too 
much difficulty and feed these in lesser amount with his dry food. It may be 
helpful to switch your cat to a prescription diet such as C/D or K/D from your 
veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
If your cat continues to vomit with the above changes, an examination will be 
necessary to make sure there are no other gastrointestinal problems.

<TEXT>
<P>
The bells on Edward Shenk's cows call out from up the hill, their choppy tune 
carried faintly on a breeze drifting through leaves of poplar and maple. 
</P>
<P>
A muddy road leads toward the sound, emerging from the trees into a grassy 
hollow where the cows dawdle in the sunlight amid a sprawl of discarded wooden 
packing crates. Sitting at the far end of the clearing are a slouching old barn 
and a red and yellow house trailer. The cows, spotting a visitor, trot away in 
alarm. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Shenk's little farm in the hills near Cumberland, also known as 
Moonshine Hollow. 
</P>
<P>
Shenk makes whiskey here, or used to until a few months ago, when five state 
revenuers for the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Enforcement Unit walked out of the 
woods one rainy Tuesday afternoon to stop the whole thing. They poured out his 
bubbling barrels of mash -- which Shenk's hogs quickly lapped up -- and 
disconnected the propane tank from the four burners beneath his 60-gallon 
copper pot still. 
</P>
<P>
Shenk had cleverly placed the rig inside one of the weathered gray packing 
crates near the barn, and he had lined up the plastic barrels of mash inside 
the trailer. But the state agents were wise to the camouflage. They had crawled 
through the woods around the clearing during two weeks of surveillance and knew 
exactly where to look when they approached Shenk. 
</P>
<P>
"One of them walked up," Shenk said. "He showed his badge and said, 'Do you 
know what we're after?' And I said, 'Hell, yes, I know what you're after.' " 
</P>
<P>
Shenk paused. Wanting to be neighborly about all this, he added: "They were 
very polite, a friendly bunch of people. They laughed and joked the whole 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The agents can usually afford to be polite these days. The old days of 
moonshine shoot-outs are as good as gone, and raids have become so rare that 
they are curiosities. A state police officer who got wind of the raid on his 
scanner wheeled up the muddy road to see the show, and two of the five agents 
were on hand mostly to look and learn. 
</P>
<P>
That's because Shenk is literally part of a vanishing breed, said Marvin Bond, 
a spokesman for the tax enforcement unit. "A lot of the old guys who do this 
are dying off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe, Shenk said. Then he added, with a twinkle in his eye: "There are 
more people doing this than you'd think." 
</P>
<P>
Shenk pleaded guilty recently in Allegany County District Court to charges of 
manufacturing illicit whiskey and possessing untaxed alcohol. He could have 
been fined up to $10,000 and sent to jail for up to five years on each count. 
But Judge Paul J. Stakem levied only a $500 fine and a suspended six-month jail 
sentence and put Shenk on unsupervised probation for two years. 
</P>
<P>
At 55, despite a penchant for chain-smoking, Shenk probably has more than a few 
good years left should he ever decide to re-enter the business. Though his 
right hand is twisted and crippled, his tanned, crinkled face shows that he 
still spends plenty of time outdoors, and the mud and grime on his clothes and 
boots attest that he still slogs through the muddiest of fields to get the 
chores done. 
</P>
<P>
Shenk comes by the trade honest. His father took up moonshining in the hills of 
Page County, Va., when Shenk was as young and frisky as the young calves on his 
farm. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 2 or 3," Shenk said. "He taught me how when I was 14 or 15." 
</P>
<P>
Shenk got two pieces of advice from his dad: "Never sell to a stranger, and 
always make good whiskey. If it's no damn good, nobody will want to drink it." 
</P>
<P>
In the days of Shenk's childhood, whiskey making was booming all over the 
Southeast. One bunch in Kentucky in the 1930s was even so brazen as to come 
howling out of the hills one evening, guns firing, to bust up a tent revival 
where a prohibitionist was railing against the evils of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
In 1937 alone, federal agents seized 3,406 stills in the region that included 
Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and North Carolina. Volume dropped off in 
World War II with the shortage of manpower and the rationing of sugar. 
</P>
<P>
But after the war, business picked up again, so much so that it seemed ready to 
grow into a well-organized concern that would squeeze out the Edward Shenks of 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
W. T. Benson, then director of Maryland's alcohol tax unit, complained in 1948: 
"You don't have your old-time mountaineer type of bootlegger anymore except in 
the back hills of South and North Carolina. . . . The operators today are 
slick. They can make liquor faster than ever. They use powerful cars to make 
their deliveries and get in touch with each other by short-wave radio." 
</P>
<P>
But Benson's prediction proved premature, although the moonshine business 
remained strong into the late 1960s. State agents found stills just about 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
But the rapid rise of sugar prices in the 1970s put the business mostly back in 
the hands of the small-timers, who insist that they are in the trade for 
quality, not quantity. And even the gasohol-inspired era of the late 1970s -- 
when the Mother Earth News was teaching anybody who cared to learn how to brew 
their own alcohol for fuel -- failed to trigger another boom. 
</P>
<P>
"We had feared what was going to happen with gasohol was that a whole new 
generation of people would come up with this stuff," Bond said. "But that 
really hasn't happened. The reason probably is that drugs are so much more 
profitable." 
</P>
<P>
During all this time, Shenk has made moonshine in several places. A few years 
back, he bought a fine-looking copper still in North Carolina. He ran it for a 
while in his house in Cumberland, then moved it last winter up to the little 
farm that he rents. He learned later from the landlord that during Prohibition, 
the place was called Moonshine Hollow. 
</P>
<P>
Shenk couldn't have made much money on his moonshine. The capacity of his 
still, which he fed with rye mash, was about 39 gallons a week. At an asking 
price of $20 to $25 a gallon, that would provide a gross income of about $780 a 
week. The cost of sugar, rye and glass jugs cut deeply into that. 
</P>
<P>
So, then, why make whiskey at all? "I just made it for certain guys in 
Cumberland," Shenk said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, "there is a market for this," Bond said. "Some people swear they prefer 
the taste." 
</P>
<P>
Does Shenk like the flavor? "Never drinked a drop in my life," he said. "Never. 
I'd tell how good it was by looking at it. . . . The only way you can tell if 
it's potent or not is to put some in a spoon and see if it burns with a blue 
flame." 
</P>
<P>
Brewing up a batch is not difficult, Shenk said, just time-consuming. "But you 
got to know what you're doing. If you don't have a nice copper outfit, you're 
in trouble already. Too much poison stuff." 
</P>
<P>
That is because some moonshiners, apparently less concerned about quality 
control, have used such methods as adding lye to speed fermentation of the 
mash, or using an old car radiator, with its residual brew of chemicals, as a 
condenser. 
</P>
<P>
Such health hazards are the major reason that the state still seeks out stills 
because the loss of tax revenue is probably negligible. 
</P>
<P>
Shenk did make one concession to the shiftier methods, however. He placed the 
still amid his livestock, a device often used to help mask the ripe sour smell 
of moonshine in the making. 
</P>
<P>
So, in a sense, you might say Shenk's cows and hogs were unwitting accomplices 
in his scheme. The hogs took their complicity a step further as the designated 
devourers of the used-up mash. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, it was Shenk's strict adherence to his father's advice that got 
him into trouble with the law. A fellow he didn't know asked to buy some 
moonshine, and Shenk refused. The fellow got mad and tipped off the revenuers. 
</P>
<P>
So now, his still gone, Shenk concentrates on the livestock. Eyeing his newest 
calves, he rates one a potential prize-winner, but writes off the other as a 
hopeless scoundrel. 
</P>
<P>
The hogs, meanwhile, seem forlorn, subsisting on a new, more limited diet: no 
more mash in Moonshine Hollow.

MORNINGSIDE'S GIRLS GAIN REVENGE OVER WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Morningside High Lady Monarchs Coach Frank Scott said his team definitely had 
something to prove against visiting Washington High in the championship game of 
the Morningside Tournament Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
After watching his defending state champions and No. 1 team in the nation 
defeat the Lady Generals, 65-54, Scott said he was satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside's only loss during the summer was to Washington in the L.A. Games. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like to lose and we definitely don't like to lose at home," Scott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The game plan for Morningside was simple: Get the ball to preseason 
All-American selection Lisa Leslie. Once the 6-5 senior got her hands on the 
ball, she went to work collecting a game-high 38 points, including 22 in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
Washington had a tough time getting its offense on track early in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our main problem tonight was a combination of nerves and a tough game 
by Lisa Leslie," Washington Coach Phil Chase said. 
</P>
<P>
When Leslie wasn't scoring, she was clogging the middle, forcing the Lady 
Generals to take the majority of their shots from the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside enjoyed a 14-6 lead after the first quarter, with Leslie accounting 
for 12 points. It was much of the same in the second quarter as the Lady 
Monarchs built a 35-19 halftime advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Washington basically traded baskets with Leslie and Morningside in the third 
period. Leslie scored 14 of her team's 16 points in the period. The Lady 
Generals scored 17. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference from tonight's game and the game we played in the summer was 
that the level of intensity in this game was a lot higher," Chace said. "If we 
meet them in the state tournament, it (intensity) will be higher than tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside is 4-0 and Washington, the defending 4-A City champion, is 5-1.

CARSON GOES AFTER EIGHTH CITY TITLE

<P>
In all of Carson High's glorious football history, the Colts have won 
back-to-back L.A. City Section championships only once, in 1971 and '72, when 
Wesley Walker was a star receiver. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts will get another chance at 7:30 Friday night when they meet Dorsey in 
the 4-A Division final at El Camino College. A win would also give the school 
its eighth City title. 
</P>
<P>
But Carson must overcome an inspired Dorsey, and history. Since 1982, Carson 
has won the City Section championship in every even year, including last year's 
55-7 rout of Banning, and has been runner-up in the odd years. The Colts' only 
odd-year championship was in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Carson could have ended their odd-even history by beating 
Granada Hills, but the Highlanders upset the Colts, 27-14. 
</P>
<P>
"We give the other teams a chance every other year," Coach Gene Vollnogle said. 
</P>
<P>
This year Carson seems to have the best chance. The Colts (10-1) have not lost 
since their opening game, a 24-23 setback at Bishop Amat. In the following 10 
games, Carson has outscored its opponents, 383-49, including a 28-9 defeat of 
Dorsey in the seventh game. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Armin Youngblood has completed 117 of 229 passes for 2,306 yards 
and 30 touchdowns. Wide receiver Michael Ross has caught 46 passes for 862 
yards and 15 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the attention has been focused on Youngblood and Ross, which is fine 
with Vollnogle. "I hope they forget about Tydus Winans," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Winans has caught 22 passes for 545 yards and five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Center Raul Nieto has set the example for an outstanding offensive line that 
has protected Youngblood. "The offensive line has really improved," Vollnogle 
said. "They're not standing around killing grass any more, they're hitting 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Nkosi Littleton leads the Colt defense, which has scored eight 
touchdowns, a school record. 
</P>
<P>
But the real heroes on defense are on the line, according to Vollnogle, 
finishing his 27th year at the school. "I can't believe how much they've 
improved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive ends Marcus Long and Bob Tuitau, both juniors, and defensive tackles 
Isiah Hall and Jason Savaaetase have anchored a defense that has allowed only 
three rushing touchdowns and 292 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey (9-3) enters the final with several motivational edges. "They've got a 
lot of things going for them," Vollnogle said. "It's their first 4-A 
championship (appearance), and we beat them once this year. They've got nothing 
to lose; they can open it up. They can try different things. And if it doesn't 
work, it doesn't matter, because nobody expects them to win." 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey has never beaten Carson in nine meetings dating to 1971, including an 
emotional 14-13 loss in last year's playoffs, which was also a rematch. A 
Carson win would give the Colts four victories over Dorsey in two years. 
</P>
<P>
The Dorsey players are also fighting for the memory of senior receiver Kevin 
Copeland, who collapsed during the Dons' game with San Pedro on Oct. 6 and died 
of heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey is led by junior running back Lamont Warren, who has rushed for 770 
yards and 20 touchdowns. Quarterback Chris Cook has thrown for 805 yards and 
nine touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore offensive tackle Cedric White (6-4, 250) and senior Demetrick Watts 
(6-0, 260) are formidable blockers. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey linebacker Tamecus Peoples has 11 sacks, a single-season school record. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's game marks Carson's 13th appearance in the City championship and its 
ninth straight. Yet, it never gets old for the man who has been coaching at 
Carson since the school opened in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no problem for me to get excited," Vollnogle said. "If I didn't get 
enthusiastic about it, then I would retire."

SWITCH FAILS; POMONA TO TRY HUMANE SOCIETY AGAIN

<P>
After abandoning a plan to buy animal control services from an entrepreneur 
whose last venture was shut down by the Internal Revenue Service, the City 
Council voted this week to reopen negotiations with the nonprofit Pomona Valley 
Humane Society. 
</P>
<P>
But the city and the Humane Society are still at odds over the cost of the 
service, and unless a new agreement can be reached, the society plans to stop 
serving Pomona at midnight on Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The society has been picking up stray dogs and cats in Pomona for 40 years. The 
City Council began looking for an alternative after the organization raised its 
rates nearly 30%. Last month, the council voted 3 to 2 to contract with a 
business that would incorporate animal-control services into a proposed 
one-stop pet center, offering pet supplies, a veterinarian clinic and other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The Companion Animal Care Center proposal would have cost the city $210,000 a 
year and the center would have kept an additional $180,000 in dog-license and 
other fees. Under that proposal, the city would have paid $85,000 less for 
animal-control services than the Humane Society had requested for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Steward, head of Companion Animal Care Center, said the city lost 
interest in contracting with him after publication of stories that ignored "the 
good points" of the proposal and focused on the IRS in Denver shutting down his 
previous business over nonpayment of payroll taxes. Steward, who attributed the 
tax problem to mistakes by a bookkeeper, said he withdrew his offer after city 
staff members told him that the city was no longer interested in it. It was 
only after reporters questioned city officials about Steward's tax problems 
that they began to back away from the contract. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council unanimously instructed the city staff to negotiate a new 
agreement with the Humane Society, it also voted 3 to 2 -- with Mayor Donna 
Smith and Councilman Mark A. T. Nymeyer dissenting -- to solicit other offers 
for animal control services at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Before considering the issue at its meeting Monday night, the council took the 
unusual step of refusing to hear any discussion from the audience. The council 
normally listens to anyone who wants to speak on any item on its agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Nymeyer said the issue had already been thoroughly aired, and Councilwoman Nell 
Soto said she could not imagine that anyone would have anything new to say on 
the subject. The motion to reject public comment was adopted 4 to 1, over the 
objections of Mayor Smith, who said: "If this passes, I think it stinks." She 
said that in more than four years on the council, she could not recall another 
occasion when public comment had been prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant said public participation was 
foreclosed because members of the audience were poised to attack Nymeyer, who 
is running for the state Assembly, and Bryant, who is the target of a recall 
campaign. "They were looking for a forum to cut up Nymeyer and me," Bryant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Keith A. Johnson, attorney for the Humane Society, attempted to speak to the 
council, but was thwarted. Afterward, he said that he wanted to tell the 
council that the Humane Society is willing to talk about a new agreement but 
that the negotiating "needs to be from both sides -- not the city dictating to 
the Humane Society." 
</P>
<P>
The council instructed the city staff to obtain an agreement that spells out 
the level of service to be provided and establishes a system for accounting for 
the expenditure of public funds. Until a new agreement is reached, the city 
will continue paying the Humane Society for service at its current rate, 
excluding the $66,000-a-year increase sought by the society. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson said the Humane Society has notified the city that it will not 
continue service at the old rate after Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The Pomona Valley Humane Society serves Claremont, Chino, Diamond Bar, La 
Verne, Montclair and San Dimas, in addition to Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
Until this year, the society computed the cost of its animal control services, 
deducted the revenue collected from dog licenses and other fees and then 
divided the remaining costs among the cities. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the society began calculating revenue and costs separately for each 
city, leading to major cost increases for Pomona. The society contends Pomona 
has so many stray animals that it requires more service than neighboring 
cities, and many of its residents are unwilling or unable to pay for dog 
licenses, keeping revenues low. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new formula, Pomona is being asked to pay $294,900 a year for 
services that cost Claremont $31,735, La Verne $24,288, and San Dimas $28,661. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bryant said the Humane Society arrived at its payment formula by 
"listening to these small pumpernickel towns around us." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Smith said the city should immediately try to reach an interim agreement 
with the Humane Society to assure service after Dec. 31. But Bryant said he 
believes the Humane Society is legally obligated to continue serving Pomona 
under the 1950 agreement in which the city gave the Humane Society an acre of 
land for its animal shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The 1950 agreement says that the property "together with all buildings and 
improvements" will revert to the city if the Humane Society "does not operate 
and function pursuant to the purposes for which it was founded and 
incorporated." Humane Society officials said that, because the society plans to 
continue caring for animals, it will retain the property even if it stops 
serving the city of Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
But Patrick Sampson, who recently retired as city attorney, wrote a memorandum 
last year saying that the city could regain the property, if the Humane Society 
stopped providing pound and animal control services to Pomona. Sampson based 
his opinion on a document that carried out the deed transfer two years after 
the 1950 agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant said the city could insist that the Humane Society live up to the terms 
of the 1950 agreement, which calls for it to provide animal control services in 
return only for dog license fees. But Bryant said neither the city nor the 
society have abided by that agreement and he is willing to give the society 
additional funding. The question is how much. 
</P>
<P>
William Harford, executive director of the Humane Society, said it would be 
difficult to reduce the cost of service to Pomona, but it might be possible to 
offset some of the cost with higher revenue. Harford said he would not propose 
any increase in the city's dog license fee, but he has ideas for other ways of 
raising revenue that he would like to discuss with the city. 
</P>
<P>
Harford said he hopes an agreement can be reached soon. "It's time to put this 
puppy to bed," he said.

ALHAMBRA GIVES SMOKING BINGO PLAYERS A BREAK; 
</P>
<P>
FUND RAISING: CATHOLIC CHURCH AND JEWISH TEMPLE LOST MONEY AFTER CITY BANNED 
SMOKING IN PUBLIC, SO THEY PERSUADED OFFICIALS TO REVERSE DECISION FOR BINGO 
GAMES.

ALHAMBRA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
St. Therese Church and Temple Beth Torah share a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Bingo. Or more specifically, bingo and smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the city's smoking ban went into effect in July, the two religious 
organizations have been struggling with declining attendance at their formerly 
lucrative, weekly bingo nights. 
</P>
<P>
At least half of the bingo players smoke at the games, said temple bingo 
chairman Sam Schiffman. The Alhambra ban prompted smokers to take their 
business elsewhere. Wekly attendance tumbled from about 190 players to 130, and 
the temple needs 150 players to break even, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were people who were regular players," Schiffman said of those who left. 
"It hurts. We had a three-month period when we did not make any money for the 
Temple." 
</P>
<P>
At St. Therese, which sponsors bingo games on Thursday nights to raise money 
for the St. Therese School, attendance fell in half, down to just 60 players, 
said principal Paul McLaughlin. Consistently losing money on the bingo games in 
recent months, the church is on the verge of ending its bingo nights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council decided Monday night to come to the rescue, voting to 
introduce an ordinance that would exempt bingo nights sponsored by religious or 
charitable groups from the smoking ban. The exemption would apply only if the 
games aren't in city-owned buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed ordinance, bingo sponsors would have to install smoke 
reducers in the ceiling and provide smoke-filtering ashtrays. If the bingo room 
has more than 40 players, at least 25% of the seats must be reserved for 
nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance, scheduled for a final vote Jan. 8, is an attempt to 
solve what apparently is a problem unique to Alhambra. "We're the only city 
that I've heard of that's come up against this," said Philip Hofmann, a 
management assistant for the city. 
</P>
<P>
In Pasadena, which adopted a smoking ban in 1984, smoking isn't permitted at 
bingos, but there have been no complaints about the restriction, said Mel Lim, 
an environmental health specialist for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena enforces its ban only after complaints, Lim said. Alhambra officers, 
in contrast, have been actively enforcing the ban. 
</P>
<P>
At least 52 of the state's 456 cities have adopted smoking restrictions in 
recent years, but it is not known how many specifically restrict smoking at 
bingo games or how many are adopting exemptions to ease their bans, said Lucy 
Hogan, a research librarian for the League of California cities. 
</P>
<P>
Some cities with general smoking bans, such as Beverly Hills, have been 
loosening restrictions gradually. For example, smoking was originally banned in 
all restaurants but is now allowed in a restaurant's cocktail lounge and bar, 
said City Clerk Jean Ushijima. 
</P>
<P>
For Temple Beth Torah, the Alhambra Council's decision Monday is a mixed 
blessing. Although allowing smoking would attract more players, Schiffman said, 
a change in policy would be yet another adjustment for bingo organizers, who 
have been advertising their "100% no-smoking games" as a positive aspect. He 
said the strategy has attracted some nonsmoking players. 
</P>
<P>
But for St. Therese Church, the council's decision is a relief. Proceeds from 
the games bring in about $18,000 a year, or 5% of the school's budget, 
McLaughlin said. The money has been used to start a kindergarten and also funds 
scholarships and computer equipment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The games are also an important social outlet for many senior citizens, 
McLaughlin said. Frequently, players show up two hours before the games start 
just to chat with friends, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We still are trying to build our business back up," McLaughlin said, adding 
that city officials have indicated the smoking ban would not be actively 
enforced now that an exemption has been proposed. But having lost so many 
regular players, he said, the task will not be easy.

NEW CRACK FUELS OPPOSITION TO GARVEY RESERVOIR

Metropolitan Water District of Southern California officials say they have 
almost remedied the flooding from the 41-acre Garvey Reservoir in Monterey 
Park, which damaged two homes on Fulton Drive. 
</P>
<P>
But Monterey Park officials are continuing to oppose the reopening of the 
reservoir, particularly since a second crack near its base was found this week 
about 1,000 feet from the first one.

2 OFFERS TO BUY LAND ON PLAZA TURNED DOWN BY COMPTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week turned a cold shoulder to two buyers offering 
millions of dollars for land that has been empty for years in the Compton Auto 
Plaza along the Artesia Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Complaining that the price was not right, the council Tuesday rejected a 
$3.7-million offer from a Mack Truck franchise that wants to develop a sales 
and service facility on about 12 acres. 
</P>
<P>
A few moments later, the council rejected an offer by a group of community 
activists to pay $5 million in cash for 24 acres in the plaza. The council 
previously had turned down the group's request to turn over the land for free 
for a development of moderately priced owner-occupied townhouses. 
</P>
<P>
The truck sales and service operation, proposed by Universal Mack Sales and 
Service Inc., was rejected by Mayor Walter Tucker and Councilwomen Patricia 
Moore and Bernice Woods, who objected to selling the land below its appraised 
value of $4.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
They also expressed concern over Mack's proposal to make a $1-million down 
payment and pay the rest over 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Maxcy Filer and Jane Robbins pressed for the sale, saying the 
proposal would generate jobs and tax revenues for the financially strapped 
city. 
</P>
<P>
"That land has been vacant for at least 20 years. This is the best proposal we 
have had on that land," Filer said. Robbins argued that the sales tax revenues 
that would be generated by truck sales were more important to the city than 
receiving cash up front for the land. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, Mack also said it would build a $2.5-million sales and 
service facility that would serve as security in case the company defaulted on 
its payments to the city. But that part of the proposal failed to sway the 
majority. The city has already taken possession of two empty auto buildings 
from dealers who closed, defaulting on their city loans. 
</P>
<P>
In its proposal, Universal Mack also offered to guarantee sales tax revenues to 
the city, making up the difference if revenues fell short of projections. 
</P>
<P>
No projected revenues were listed in the proposal before the council Tuesday, 
but the Universal Mack franchise in the last three months has recorded about 
$20 million in sales at the two sales and service operations that it wants to 
move to Compton, company President W. W. Hall told the council. Those sales 
would have generated about $200,000 in sales tax revenues in Compton, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Universal Mack wants to move sales and service operations in Los Angeles and 
Signal Hill to the Compton site. 
</P>
<P>
After the council vote, City Clerk Charles Davis, speaking as a private 
citizen, blasted the council decision. He pointed out that Universal Mack was 
offering to pay $1 million in cash up front, while the city still is waiting to 
collect on land it sold at a discount last year in another redevelopment 
project, the proposed Northside Shopping Center a block north of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not got one penny for that land, even though we probably put $10 
million into clearing it," Davis said. "Here we have a developer who was ready 
to tender $1 million today." 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment Director Cynthia Coleman said in an interview after the meeting 
that the city spent far less than $10 million to clear the land, where 
construction of a K mart store is scheduled to begin, possibly in March. She 
said she did not remember the exact amount. 
</P>
<P>
The Redevelopment Agency staff also had recommended that the council reject the 
Universal Mack proposal. Coleman said it is clear that the City Council is not 
willing to sell land at discount prices, a common practice among redevelopment 
agencies trying to lure businesses to their cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not looking at writing down any land," Coleman said. "The agency is 
looking toward achieving fair market value." 
</P>
<P>
Woods and Moore, who joined Tucker in rejecting the proposal, were voted into 
office earlier this year after city officials drew heavy criticism from 
residents for selling land for less than its appraised value. Referring to the 
Mack proposal, Woods and Moore said they were opposed to "giving away" land. 
</P>
<P>
Moore also called the proposal a piecemeal approach that would involve only 12 
of the remaining 24 acres to be developed at the plaza. She pointed out that 
the council agreed this summer to work on a comprehensive plan to develop the 
24 acres, and said it would consider such new uses as an electronics sales park 
and an entertainment center. 
</P>
<P>
Mack representatives said after the vote that they will hold further 
discussions before deciding whether to make a new offer. 
</P>
<P>
The council's rejection of the housing proposal was nothing new for the South 
Central Organizing Committee (SCOC). The community activist group had been 
trying to persuade the council for months to set aside the land for 
construction of 600 townhouses that would be sold to working families for about 
$60,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have repeatedly rejected the idea, contending the commercial 
land is the city's most valuable asset, and that a housing development would 
not generate jobs or tax revenues equal to the services that the city would 
have to provide for a housing development. 
</P>
<P>
"We said no to housing and that's it as far as we're concerned," Councilman 
Filer said. 
</P>
<P>
But SCOC representatives are scheduled to meet today with the redevelopment 
staff for further discussions, said SCOC spokesman Larry Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
He described the $5-million offer as a starting point for negotiations. He also 
said the group might consider another site, if one were made available. Some 
city officials have mentioned alternate sites, but the city has never formally 
raised that possibility, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
When Compton opened its auto plaza in 1978, it envisioned a 66-acre car mall 
with as many as two dozen dealers to supply the economically depressed 
community with a steady stream of sales tax dollars. Within two years, though, 
city officials began scaling back their plans, conceding that Compton could not 
compete with auto malls in neighboring cities. Compton never attracted more 
than four dealerships to the mall, so it began looking for other ways to use 
the land. Some of it was set aside for the new Compton Lazben Hotel and 
convention center.

HOTEL'S FEES IN DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dispute between the city and owners of the Huntington Hotel over $420,000 in 
development impact fees will be negotiated by the Board of Directors. 
</P>
<P>
The Gemtel Corp., which is remodeling the main building at the 83-year-old 
hotel, maintains that the company owes only $128,627 in development impact 
fees, instead of the $548,357 assessed by the city for new construction. 
</P>
<P>
Gemtel officials said the hotel is entitled to an exemption granted under the 
city's impact fee ordinance for reconstruction of buildings damaged by natural 
catastrophes. The main building at the Huntington Hotel was never built to 
withstand earthquakes and was seriously weakened during the 1987 Whittier 
Earthquake, Gemtel officials said. Thus the building had to be destroyed for 
public safety, they argued. 
</P>
<P>
The board directed Gemtel to pay $1.2 million in other fees owed the city and 
hold the disputed $420,000 in an escrow account until the issue is resolved.

COUNCIL CALLS FOR BALLOT MEASURE ON POLICE SURTAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council, which has frequently discussed the need for more police, is 
taking steps to draw up a ballot proposal that asks Long Beach voters to 
approve a property tax surcharge to pay for an additional 75 police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Although a task force studying ways of paying for more police officers has not 
yet made any recommendations to the council, the council this week asked city 
staff members to prepare the ballot measure. It would come before the council 
within the next month for a vote, and if approved, would be placed on the 
ballot sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
The 650-member Police Department has long complained that it is seriously 
understaffed, although a private consultant's report last summer concluded that 
the department could solve many of its staffing problems without hiring more 
officers if it changed some of its personnel policies. Those personnel changes 
are now the subject of negotiations with the police union.

Pasadena Planned Parenthood will receive $50,000 from the city to help continue 
its operations, which suffered a cut of $114,000 in state funds after Gov. 
George Deukmejian lowered the state family planning budget by two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
The city money will be paid over two years. The board directed its Sacramento 
legislative advocate to lobby for restoration of state funding so the money can 
be repaid to the city.

Planned Parenthood was one of three social service agencies with budget 
shortfalls to receive special allocations. Day One, an anti-drug abuse program,

ASSEMBLYMAN HILL DROPS PLAN TO HELP LAME DUCK COUNCILMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE CHANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), under heavy criticism for saying he might 
seek legislation to extend the terms of three Diamond Bar City Council members 
if one of them agrees not to un against him, apparently has dropped the idea, a 
city official said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Forbing said an aide to Hill informed him last Thursday the 
assemblyman had abandoned plans to sponsor the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's proposed legislation was the council's last hope of averting a required 
municipal election in April for council seats held by Councilmen Gary Miller, 
Gary Werner and Forbing. 
</P>
<P>
Hill and his aides didn't respond to several telephone messages left at his Los 
Angeles and Sacramento offices this week. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a technicality in state law, the three councilmen -- elected in 
March -- can't complete their two-year terms without the special legislation. 
</P>
<P>
So now Diamond Bar officials, already $52,000 in debt to the county for the 
city's last election, are preparing to set an April 10 election date. The 
council is expected to vote on the matter at its Jan. 2 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Diamond Bar City Atty. Andrew Arczynski said he has contacted 
the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office about Hill's statements, 
reported last Thursday in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said in an interview last week he wouldn't introduce legislation to extend 
the councilmen's terms by one year unless Miller agrees not to run against him 
for the seat vacated by the resignation of state Sen. William Campbell 
(R-Hacienda Heights). 
</P>
<P>
Hill has announced plans to seek Campbell's job, and Miller is considering 
running. 
</P>
<P>
An extended term would help Miller because he wouldn't have to choose between 
running for the state Senate and City Council. Although state law doesn't 
prevent him from entering both races in the same year, Miller has said he would 
give up a council reelection campaign in 1990 if he decides to run for the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Arczynski said he wanted the district attorney to know about Hill's remarks. "I 
don't know if it's a crime, but it sounded like a quid pro quo to me: 'I'll do 
something for the city of Diamond Bar if one of the council members doesn't do 
something against me,' " Arczynski said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
However, Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district attorney, said no formal 
complaint has been filed against the assemblyman. 
</P>
<P>
Forbing said he spoke with one of Hill's aides in Sacramento on Thursday and 
learned the assemblyman had abandoned the proposal "because of the information 
in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Miller and Forbing had lambasted Hill for saying he would make 
Miller's candidacy a factor in whether to propose legislation. Miller accused 
Hill of "letting personal politics get in the way," while Forbing said the 
assemblyman was "holding us hostage." 
</P>
<P>
Hill responded to the criticism by saying: "It's just practical politics." 
</P>
<P>
The assemblyman made similar comments during a Nov. 30 breakfast meeting in 
Diamond Bar with Forbing and Werner, Forbing said. "He said, 'I'm not sure 
(about legislation) because Gary's thinking of running. If Gary decides not to 
run, I'll submit it,' " Forbing said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of surprised and said (Miller's candidacy) shouldn't make a 
difference," Forbing continued. "(Hill) said, 'That's politics.' " 
</P>
<P>
City officials had lobbied Hill to sponsor legislation, in the form of an 
amendment to an existing bill, that would lengthen the terms of Forbing, Miller 
and Werner. The three won't be able to serve full two-year terms because of the 
timing of Diamond Bar's incorporation as a city. Because voters approved 
cityhood in March, state law requires an April, 1990, municipal election so 
terms of the council members will be staggered, even if that means shortening 
the terms of some of them. The three lowest vote-getters in March must run 
again in April. council members. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Phyllis Papen and Councilman Paul Horcher, the top finishers in the 
city's March election, don't face reelection until 1992 and aren't directly 
affected by the extension controversy.

LOW-INCOME APARTMENTS HERALD NEW AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

PASADENA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Balloons and banners decorated the three newly built, low-income apartments at 
Villa Street and Raymond Avenue known as The Villa Parke Homes. Officials 
clustered outside, talking of tax-credit financing and corporate investors like 
Arco, the Chevron Corp., Transamerica Corp. and Levi Strauss &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
But inside, three women ignored the speeches. Faces beaming, they traipsed 
room-to-room, inspecting the apartments they would soon call home. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just walking all over your carpet, girl," one woman joked to tenant 
Margie Crockett. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Heard, another tenant, became serious for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm living with my sister and paying $300 for me and my two kids in one room," 
Heard said. "So, this is a blessing." 
</P>
<P>
The victim of a stroke 1 1/2 years ago, Heard, 35, said her ill health halted 
her nursing career and forced her family to live on welfare payments of $580 a 
month. The move into the three-bedroom apartment -- for which she'll pay $198 a 
month -- symbolizes a new beginning for her. 
</P>
<P>
It also symbolizes a new beginning for the city, which helped finance the nine 
units. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a model for the kind of low-income housing we want to do in the future," 
said Bill Reynolds, director of Pasadena's Housing and Development Department, 
at the open-house celebration Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Villa Parke buildings were designed to resemble the architecture of the 
Craftsman-style homes in the neighborhood. They are a radical departure from 
the city's previous venture into low-income housing: the crime-plagued 313-unit 
Kings Village housing project in the northwest. 
</P>
<P>
More small-scale housing projects like Villa Parke, that blend with the 
neighborhood, are planned. Yet, housing officials admit that providing 
low-income housing in Pasadena is like trying to fill the Arroyo Seco with 
teaspoonfuls of soil. 
</P>
<P>
The city will need 1,466 low- and moderate-income housing units in the next 
five years, according to estimates by the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments. But the city's five-year, $13.2-million housing plan calls for 
only 665 units. 
</P>
<P>
"Most jurisdictions don't pay much attention to (the association's estimates) 
because their estimates don't relate to the realities of the housing market," 
said Pasadena's Housing Administrator Leslie Lambert. "Most housing plans 
explain to the state why cities won't meet their goals." 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena's explanation includes lack of vacant land in its urban environment, 
the high cost of land and construction and past moves by the Reagan 
Administration to end the flow of federal dollars to fund new, low-income 
housing construction. 
</P>
<P>
But advocates of low-income housing say the explanation should include a 
history of ignoring low-income housing needs. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, the city just kind of hid its head in the sand as far as low-income 
housing," said Saundra Knox, director of Neighborhood Housing Services. Instead 
of initiating projects, the city merely waited for developers to volunteer with 
housing, Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics believe city officials followed a policy in the past of ignoring 
low-income housing needs in the northwest, where most of the city's minorities 
live, to preserve areas of low-cost land that could be developed into business 
parks, said community activist Don Wheeldin. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some fears now, especially in the black community, that if the 
growth management initiative is overturned, businesses will move into the 
northwest where the land is cheapest and the people are most vulnerable," 
Wheeldin said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's growth management initiative, passed by the voters in March, puts 
limits on new residential and commercial construction in the city for 10 years. 
It is being challenged in court by the Chamber of Commerce and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeldin believes the city is still failing to meet its low-income housing 
responsibilities. But Knox said Pasadena has become more active in pursuing 
affordable housing, partly because of new state requirements. 
</P>
<P>
And given the obstacles, housing administrator Lambert said the city has made 
significant progress in providing affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's phenomenal what the city has provided in the last five years," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
A change in the state redevelopment law four years ago required Pasadena and 
other cities to spend 20% of redevelopment tax revenues on low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the nine new units, Pasadena has 515 low-income rental units. They 
include the 313 units at Kings Village along Fair Oaks Avenue, 150 units in the 
Concord Senior Housing Apartments at 275 E. Cordova St., and 52 units set aside 
in three separate apartment complexes totaling 260 units built by developer Tim 
Cantwell. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city provided loans for 16 low-income buyers at the 80-unit 
Villa Marengo Townhouse Project in the 500 block of N. Marengo Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, the city plans to oversee construction of 315 units and 
rehabilitation of 330 units of low- and moderate-income housing. Some of those 
projects include 144 units in the former YMCA building downtown, now being 
remodeled, 44 units in a proposed rehabilitation of the old police building and 
19 units in three small, separate townhouse projects like Villa Parke. 
</P>
<P>
The city also will work with Neighborhood Housing Services to provide $4.4 
million in rehabilitation money, which includes city and federal dollars, to 
northwest residential property owners for rehabilitation. Part of the money is 
earmarked for development of the 15-block area there called the Lincoln 
Triangle. 
</P>
<P>
Also essential to the city's progress, Knox said, has been Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
"She opened up people's minds a little more," Knox said. "She contributed a lot 
in City Hall toward the awareness of the kinds of things that could be done." 
</P>
<P>
Villa Parke Homes are an example of increasingly sophisticated financing 
methods used by housing advocates and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
The city provided a $310,000 loan to the Los Angeles Community Design Center, 
one of more than 25 nonprofit corporations in Los Angeles that specialize in 
designing and operating low-income projects. 
</P>
<P>
Integral to the project's construction was $560,000 provided by the California 
Equity Fund, another nonprofit corporation that sells tax credits from 
low-income housing projects to corporations seeking to reduce their tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
The tax credits, available since the 1986 federal tax reform bill, have helped 
create more than 100,000 units of housing nationwide and 10,000 in California, 
said Anita Landecker, a California Equity spokeswoman. Generally, the tax 
credits provide about one-third of total project construction costs, she added. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing left now in terms of raising federal development money is tax 
credits," Lambert said, emphasizing their importance. Earlier this month, 
Congress reluctantly approved a one-year extension of the credits, which were 
supposed to expire this year, but not without cutting the amount available for 
the credits by 25%. 
</P>
<P>
Housing advocates will have to lobby Congress next year for another extension, 
but Lambert won't be among them, at least, not on behalf of Pasadena. In 
January, she leaves her Pasadena post for a job with the Los Angeles Community 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
In her five years with Pasadena, Lambert, who also serves as a Santa Monica 
Planning Commission member, said the city has made a turnaround in its 
commitment to low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
"Pasadena is every bit as progressive in housing as Santa Monica is," she said. 
But, she added, "You need an advocate in this position."

WEST HOLLYWOOD CARD CLUB BACKERS REFUSE TO GIVE UP PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAY EVANS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supporters of a referendum for a legalized gambling club in West Hollywood 
insist the proposal is "absolutely not dead," despite the City Council's 
refusal to approve a request for the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
The council, caught in the cross-fire of opposition from residents and a 
well-organized campaign by proponents, voted unanimously Monday night to reject 
a request for a referendum that would have allowed gambling on all legal card 
games at Cavendish West Hollywood, a private bridge and rummy club at 9255 W. 
Sunset Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
But Cavendish general partner Philip Marks said Tuesday that the proposal is 
"absolutely not dead." He said Cavendish proponents may seek to have the issue 
placed on the 1990 ballot by petition or may submit a new plan to build the 
club on the city's shabby east end. 
</P>
<P>
Cavendish officials say the city would have received more than $6 million a 
year in fees from the business. They spent months lobbying the City Council and 
local AIDS and seniors groups, which could have received some of that money. 
</P>
<P>
Council members appeared unprepared for the vociferous opposition and pleas for 
support of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain issues in politics that are moral issues, and it is 
difficult to have a rational debate," Councilman Steve Schulte said after the 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"What politician wants to get in front of all that?" Schulte said, referring to 
the several hours of heated testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Cavendish officials seemed surprised at the council's unanimous rejection of 
the referendum after the months-long lobbying effort. Lobbyist Bruce Decker 
said the group had been up-front with council members during individual 
meetings, and that they were cautiously optimistic before the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it was unnecessarily hasty. We have demonstrated a willingness to 
work with residents and with the city in revising the proposal so that it would 
be more acceptable," Decker said. 
</P>
<P>
Plans presented to the council focused on converting the dowdy bridge and rummy 
club into an upscale Las Vegas-style casino. But Cavendish officials Monday 
night took a different approach, suggesting that all aspects of the plan would 
be flexible, including location and hours of operation, provided voters 
approved an ordinance to allow gambling in the club. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of the opposition to the Sunset Strip club came from residents of 
the nearby Sierra Towers apartment complex in West Hollywood, who had been 
bused in on what some were calling an "anti-gambler's special." There were also 
impassioned pleas from residents of nearby Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Though much of the testimony targeted the more mundane issues of parking and 
traffic problems that could result from a nightly influx of a possible 500 
out-of-town gamblers that the club could accommodate, many questioned the 
"moral turpitude" that gambling would bring to West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"In their proposal, they quote a psychiatrist who says gambling is a part of 
every known society. Well, so is prostitution and so is murder," said Barbara 
Lazaroff, part owner of Spago, an upscale restaurant in West Hollywood, who 
spoke at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Card clubs in several Los Angeles-area cities, including Bell and Commerce, 
have been beset with crime and corruption problems since opening in the early 
1980s. Such cities turned to legalized gambling to shore up treasuries depleted 
by tax-cutting Proposition 13 in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
As more clubs were approved, however, increased competition led to decreased 
profits, leaving some card-club cities with losing hands. In addition, the 
large amounts of money involved led to corruption among some city officials. In 
the early and mid-1980s, 14 people in Bell and Commerce, including three city 
councilmen and a former mayor, were convicted of or pleaded guilty to charges 
of bribery and racketeering involving card clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Located in the heart of the upscale Westside, West Hollywood has long attracted 
the interest of card club operators seeking to cash in on affluent patrons from 
Beverly Hills and the San Fernando Valley. Operators of card clubs in Southeast 
cities, such as Commerce, estimate that up to 30% of their customers come from 
the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
Since incorporation in 1984, gambling proponents have periodically dealt out 
card club proposals to West Hollywood officials and to City Council candidates, 
hoping to find a way into the lucrative Westside market. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those deals have folded quickly. During the 1986 elections, two current 
council members, John Heilman and Helen Albert, openly scoffed at the idea of 
allowing gambling in the city. But Cavendish lobbyist Decker said recent 
discussions with council members indicated that at least three of them, 
including Heilman, might be willing to put the issue to a vote. In addition to 
the continuing contact with elected officials, Cavendish lobbyists also 
conducted a precise campaign directed at more than 85 local service groups 
hoping to sell the idea, holding meetings with more than 20 of them. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those efforts appeared to have paid off Monday night. The proposal 
received the endorsement of the Los Angeles Shanti Foundation AIDS support 
group, an influential voice in a city with a population that is more than 35% 
gay. 
</P>
<P>
"Can any of us look into our consciences and reject this kind of proposal?" 
said Mallory Freeman, past director of Shanti Foundation. "It is going to be 
harder and harder to raise money for AIDS." In addition, the proposal appeared 
to have the support of many residents of the city's poorer east side, some of 
whom said they would welcome the club on their side of town. East-side 
residents played a pivotal role in the recent defeat of a proposal to build a 
civic center in West Hollywood Park, arguing that the city needs to pay more 
attention to its poorer half. 
</P>
<P>
Investor Marks, a New York resident who also operates legalized gambling aboard 
two cruise ships, said Monday's testimony indicated that much of West Hollywood 
would support the club. 
</P>
<P>
"A small, vocal minority really got up and controlled that meeting. I don't 
think they expressed the thoughts of the people of West Hollywood," Marks said. 
"We have an education job to do in this community. We are not ogres. We are 
business people."

AZUSA PACIFIC ROLLING BUT FACES TOUGH FOE IN CHAPMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Off to one of its best starts in recent years, the Azusa Pacific University 
men's basketball team figures to receive a difficult test when it plays host to 
Chapman at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific, an NAIA team, enters the game with a 5-2 record and Chapman, an 
NCAA Division II squad, is 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman is coached by Bob Boyd, who is in his first year with the Panthers and 
has a 27-year coaching record of 456-309, including stints at USC and 
Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
Two standouts for the Panthers have been 6-4 sophomore forward Roger Middleton 
and 6-4 junior swing man Von Shuler. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa split two games against Division II teams last week, dropping a 77-70 
decision to Cal State Dominguez Hills before edging San Francisco State, 67-64. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars are headed by center Pat McMann, a sophomore transfer from Northern 
Arizona and a former Diamond Bar High standout who averages 18.2 points, and 
junior forward Matt Burns, a junior transfer from Green River Community College 
in Washington (18.1 points). 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars visit struggling Pomona-Pitzer at 9 p.m. Saturday. The Sagehens 
entered the week with a 3-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
After splitting two games in Northern California, the Cal Poly Pomona men's 
basketball team returns home against North Central College of Illinois at 7:30 
p.m. Saturday at Kellogg Gym. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos, 4-4, defeated College of Notre Dame in Belmont by 80-74 Saturday 
before dropping an 80-69 overtime decision to Cal State Hayward in Hayward. 
</P>
<P>
North Central, an NCAA Division II team, entered the week with a 4-1 record. 
The Cardinals are led by 6-6 center Mike Patterson, who averages 16.3 points 
and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona has been sparked by junior forward Terry Ross (6-6), who is averaging a 
team-leading 20.4 points and 11.7 rebounds. Other leaders are junior guard 
Chancellor McCobb (6-3), who averages 19.1 points, and senior forward Jim 
Skinner (6-4), who averages 11.2. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos also start junior Rafael Vargas (6-7) at center and sophomore D.J. 
Norman (6-1) at guard. 
</P>
<P>
The Azusa Pacific women's basketball team will try to extend a five-game 
winning streak when it visits Pomona-Pitzer at 7 p.m. Saturday at Voelkel 
Gymnasium in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Pacific is 6-1 and Pomona-Pitzer, which has won its last three games, is 
5-2. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa, in the middle of nine road games in a row, is coming off road victories 
over Redlands (57-38) and La Verne (69-55) last week. The Cougars have been led 
by 6-2 center Amy Walters, who scored 33 points and grabbed 13 rebounds in the 
victory over La Verne, and 5-10 forward Holly Ingersoll. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona, which defeated the Master's, 77-53., last Saturday, is paced by 
guard/forwards Anne Backus and Caryn Cranston (both 5-10) and 6-1 forward 
Dereka Pedersen. Cranston is the team's leading scorer and Backus is tops in 
rebounds and assists. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Gabriel, coach of the Cal Poly Pomona women's volleyball team since 1984, 
has announced his resignation to pursue an NCAA Division I coaching position. 
</P>
<P>
In six seasons at Pomona, Gabriel posted a 114-91 record, including a 16-18 
record this season. The Broncos finished fifth in the California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. this season although the team was ranked in the Division II top 
20 most of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel's teams were ranked in the Division II top 20 in five of his six 
seasons. The Broncos made the playoffs three times, including fifth-place 
finishes in 1984 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul has put a great deal of time and effort into the success of the Bronco 
program," Athletic Director Karen Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
"We accomplished many of our goals and fell short on others, but I leave with a 
positive feeling toward the overall experience," Gabriel added. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven San Gabriel Valley teams are in the final Kinney California State High 
School Cross-Country Rankings. 
</P>
<P>
Maranatha of Sierra Madre, San Marino and Webb of Claremont are listed in both

ALHAMBRA SLASHES CITY SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

ALHAMBRA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time this year, the city is slashing expenses of municipal 
agencies, including the Police and Fire departments, and increasing certain 
municipal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Following another midyear budget review, the City Council on Monday voted 
unanimously to approve cuts totaling $294,267 in 12 departments. 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, the council slashed expenditures by $422,000 to help balance 
the general fund budget, which pays for services such as public works, police, 
fire, and the library. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the council also increased the fee levied on each new residential unit 
for the construction of parks. The fee, effective immediately, soared from $50 
to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Even with that increase, the fee would be below average, City Manager Kevin 
Murphy said. He said a survey of 32 other Southern California communities 
showed that the average park fee is $1,186 a unit. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy told the council his staff would have recommended the increase 
regardless of the city's financial problems, because Alhambra's old fee was so 
low. 
</P>
<P>
The city's latest financial troubles were triggered by a combination of 
problems, including a $400,000 shortfall in sales tax revenue; a $250,000 tile 
repair project at Almansor Court, a city-owned restaurant and banquet hall, and 
the Alhambra Community Hospital's failure to make rent payments to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1974 as part of an $11.2-million redevelopment project, the hospital 
building is owned by the Alhambra Redevelopment Agency, which leases it to the 
city. The city subleases it to the Alhambra Hospital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The 157-bed hospital, at 100 S. Raymond St., has been a financial problem for 
the city ever since it accumulated $4.3 million in debts and declared 
bankruptcy in 1981. Two years later it made arrangements to begin paying back 
rent to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, however, the hospital began missing its $103,000-a-month 
payments to the city. The hospital corporation subsequently began negotiating 
with a group of doctors interested in buying the facility, but negotiations 
foundered because the buyers were having trouble arranging financing for the 
$13.6-million deal. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's delinquent rent payments have made it more difficult for the 
city to repay a 30-year bond issue that financed the hospital's construction. 
It also has complicated financing for other city projects, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Mary Louise Bunker said she was concerned about the $113,000 cut 
in the police budget, but Murphy said it would not reduce services to the 
public. Police Chief Russell Siverling said the department will postpone buying 
new computers and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Barbara Messina said the city will restore all the money cut as soon as 
the hospital's financial problems are resolved. But Murphy said he didn't know 
when that would be.

PROBLEMS FLOW INTO AMAZON; 
</P>
<P>
WHILE WORLD CONCERN FOCUSES ON BRAZIL, THE HEADWATER AREAS OF THE ANDES FACE 
EVEN MORE THREATENING DEVASTATION. 
</P>

ATAHUALPA, Ecuador 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like the waters cascading from the Andes Mountains, problems and hopes are 
pouring downstream into the Amazon jungle basin from the highlands that give 
life to the world's mightiest river. 
</P>
<P>
All along an immense crescent from Venezuela through Colombia, Ecuador, Peru 
and Bolivia, covering a distance of more than 3,000 miles, the Amazon finds its 
strength. Nearly one-third of the Amazon Basin lies in the rim of Latin 
American countries surrounding Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
While world concern homes in on Brazil's struggles over the development and 
conservation of its rain forests, the countries whose waters feed the river are 
attempting, more quietly, to cope with equally daunting dilemmas. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in several ways the array of problems facing the headwaters of the 
Amazon is more complex, and more threatening, than in Brazil itself. 
</P>
<P>
While the Brazilian settler's trek westward from the Atlantic can mean a 
2,000-mile journey, the reverse migration from the Pacific side of the 
continent rarely is longer than a few hundred miles. With limited open space 
and exploding populations, these poor, indebted nations see their Amazon 
interior as an escape valve and a potential economic salvation. 
</P>
<P>
But the Andes plunge down into jungle so suddenly -- with elevation changes of 
12,000 feet or more within a few dozen miles -- that problems like erosion and 
river-silting from deforestation take on frightening proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Conversations with dozens of officials, scientists and residents in the region 
underscore a web of crises at the headwaters: The rush to develop oil reserves 
has opened up hundreds of miles of roads, bringing a crush of settlers and land 
speculation; illegal coca fields on steep hillside jungles in Peru and Bolivia 
feed erosion, and cocaine processing pollutes rivers with tons of illegal 
chemicals; restive native Indians are chafing over relentless encroachment, and 
deforestation is proceeding at a dizzying pace. 
</P>
<P>
The conflicts result in part from the delicate landscape in the countries where 
the Amazon is born. Tiny highland brooks form the river's most tender veins. 
The headwaters then plummet down jagged canyons through fragile cloud forests 
that are among the world's wettest climates and richest ecosystems. 
</P>
<P>
The waters already have swelled into powerful rivers by the time they descend 
from the eastern Andes slopes into tropical rain forest -- as much as 1,000 
miles before joining the Amazon's main artery in the relatively flat jungle 
across the border in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
The mountains feed the rivers a rich diet of minerals, which leach into the 
soils downstream on the lowland river banks during flooding. That makes the 
land relatively attractive for farmer-settlers, in contrast to the often poorer 
jungle soils in Brazil. The geography also has left deposits of oil, gold and 
other riches in the jungles at the foot of the mountains -- all magnets for 
development. 
</P>
<P>
With a hodgepodge of sometimes conflicting and often ill-enforced policies in 
hand, governments surrounding Brazil are attempting to control the rapid 
colonization and exploitation of their Amazon regions. At the same time, their 
awareness of ecological hazards is haltingly taking hold. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists, a growing force in these countries, are waving danger flags. 
They are also moderating their anti-development stance into a more realistic 
approach of sensible, controlled development. 
</P>
<P>
"The crises in the economy and the environment are closely linked here, and 
people are beginning to realize it," said Antonio Brack Egg, a leading Peruvian 
ecologist. "We have abused, looted our resources to a terrible degree. We have 
cleared 8.5 million hectares (21 million acres) of the Amazon in Peru, and 6 
million hectares are abandoned. We must make that land productive instead of 
clearing more. What we desperately lack is planning." 
</P>
<P>
Peru and Ecuador face the gravest threats. Peru has 16% of the basin, the 
largest outside Brazil, and the basin makes up 60% of Peru's territory. Roughly 
10% of the 300,000 square miles of the Peruvian basin has been cleared of 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
Ecuador, though far smaller than Peru and containing just 2% of the basin, 
confronts a comparatively greater array of pressures, in part because its 
population density and growth rate are the highest in the region. In search of 
space and a future, its people eye the vast expanse of green below the 
mountains. Only about half of the Ecuadorean basin remains forested. 
</P>
<P>
Road Was Lacking 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, there was no road along the south bank of the Napo River, one 
of Ecuador's major Amazon tributaries. Jungle native families of the Huarani 
and the Quijos Quichua tribes hunted and farmed a few acres, and colonists -- 
usually poor Indians themselves from the Andes highlands -- pushed downriver 
from Puerto Napo, their progress slowed by the lack of transport other than 
outboard-powered dugout canoes. 
</P>
<P>
When the 25-mile dirt road was opened from Puerto Napo to Ahuano, hundreds more 
settlers followed. They were ceded 125-acre tracts by the colonization program. 
The Huarani fled to the interior, and the Quijos Quichua quickly sought to 
legalize their traditional holdings, with mixed success. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a sudden patchwork of bare-bone farms, reached by lumbering buses 
that come three times a day. Loggers are felling 2-foot-diameter hardwood 
trees. Thousands of acres of virgin rain forest have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Tapuy, a native who runs the 50-pupil primary school in the newly 
constituted village of Atahualpa, said, "The colonists have brought more 
advanced agricultural techniques, which is positive, but they also teach us 
crime, social conflict. They exploit, they take the land by force, they don't 
pay. The natives know how to exist on the land without destroying it." 
</P>
<P>
He said the 300 families, mostly natives, carefully chose the name for their 
town: Atahualpa was the 17th-Century Inca leader who resisted capture by the 
Spanish colonists in Peru. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no room here for more colonists," Tapuy said. "We are already seeing 
some erosion." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed to a bare patch on a cleared hillside where a landslide had 
occurred. "Civilization is arriving," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many Got Land Titles 
</P>
<P>
Between 1964 and 1982, 12,838 settlers and 4,343 natives received land titles 
in the Ecuadorean Amazon. Many more applications, which usually take years to 
process, are in the works. 
</P>
<P>
A major source of anger for the natives, and for conservationists and planners 
in Quito, the capital, is the principle that underlies the development program. 
The law once required settlers to clear 80% of their land in two years to win 
ownership. The rule has been eased, but the concept still prevails in practice. 
Thus, the natives who use the forest without cutting it down are penalized, 
while settlers who arrive and clear land for farming are awarded title more 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
Further encouraging deforestation is the timber-harvesting policy, which 
determines royalties on the amount of wood actually cut, rather than the 
harvestable volume on a given tract. 
</P>
<P>
Both the land title and timber policies "have had a devastating impact on 
tropical forests in the provinces of northwest and Amazonian Ecuador," said a 
study conducted for the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID). 
Although environmental laws are numerous, "the problem in Ecuador is an 
inconsistent and uncoordinated application. . . . The result is a myriad of 
legal conflicts brought on by conflicting jurisdictions, ill-defined policies, 
unclear objectives and the failure to systematically apply even the best of 
environmental laws." 
</P>
<P>
Flavio Coello of the forestry protection program in the Agriculture Ministry 
said land speculators buy up tracts, sell the logging rights and report figures 
far below what they actually cut. 
</P>
<P>
"For lack of a clear political policy, we haven't been able to stop it," he 
said. "The ownership of land in this country is in chaos." 
</P>
<P>
Coello has just four park guards to protect the entire Yasuni National Park, 
which covers 2.5 million acres in the Amazon basin. "To try to enforce control 
there would be like trying to empty the sea," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coello said colonization has already begun along the edges of Yasuni, but he 
added: "We can't blame the colonists with their 50 hectares. The fault lies 
with the government and its failure to impose order. It's as if they are in a 
trance." 
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's Amazon boom coincided with the discovery and exploitation of major 
oil reserves in the early 1970s, and few people suggest that an impoverished 
country can or should ignore such a vital source of income, even in national 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
Coello, however, expressed anger at the government oil company and several 
foreign firms, including Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum, whose 
exploration block includes a corner of Yasuni Park. He said the firms have 
refused requests to provide minimal assistance to pay for guards and research 
that would prevent oil exploration from leading to deforestation. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, he said, Conoco has agreed to provide substantial aid after 
suffering international criticism for its planned road into Yasuni for oil 
production. 
</P>
<P>
David Neill of the Missouri Botanical Garden, who has worked in Ecuador's 
jungles for four years, said that Conoco, Union Oil of California and Petro 
Canada all are supporting scientific research during their oil exploration, but 
others have not come forward to help. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Ortiz, an ecologist who advises AID, estimated that about 300 miles of 
roads have been built since the early 1970s, mostly for jungle oil production, 
"without consideration of Indian interests, the environment, anything." 
</P>
<P>
Roads are far easier to build in jungle areas nearer the Andes than Brazil 
because the rivers bring down gravel deposits needed to keep the roads from 
becoming impassable. Farther downstream, gravel is unavailable, and it must be 
hauled in for road-building at high cost. So road development and colonization 
have been easier near the headwaters of the Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
Deforestation is occurring in Ecuador at a rate of 2.3% a year, costing up to 
850,000 acres a year, including 187,500 acres of virgin forest, according to 
the study done for AID. 
</P>
<P>
For those charged with development in the region, however, roads are the 
solution. Asked to name the No. 1 priority for the Napo River area, land title 
office secretary Juan Leonardo Mera said: "Highways. This is the fundamental 
basis of growth. With roads, the people work harder, plant more yuca, coffee, 
and the costs drop because they can take out their products." 
</P>
<P>
The land title office, one of six in the Amazon, approves about 200 new titles 
a year. Of the total 1.43 million acres in its area, the office has carved up 
834,000 for development, while 307,000 acres are set aside as protected zones. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Romo, an Agriculture Ministry land analyst, said the timber industry, not 
the small colonist, is the real villain in deforestation. 
</P>
<P>
"They can clear 50 acres in two months, and they have no programs of 
forestation. Then the destruction starts, the soil weakens and erosion sets 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Romo's department recently began a program to provide residents with seedlings 
to reforest fields. 
</P>
<P>
Army Takes Role 
</P>
<P>
Hugo Ramiro Landazuri, governor of Napo province, said the government is using 
the army at checkpoints to control colonization, stop land speculation and 
reduce frictions between natives and settlers. The Napo region, with a total 
population approaching 300,000, has grown so fast that it was split into two 
provinces this year: Napo itself, with the capital at Tena, and Sucumbios to 
the north, with the capital in the oil town of Lago Agrio. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said he opposes further colonization, preferring to focus on 
better use of the land already cleared. "We also have hydroelectric potential 
(and) we have marble and gold. These can be developed carefully. 
</P>
<P>
"The natives believe that the whites and mestizos (mixed-race people) are 
invading and taking their land," he said. "But it is also necessary that the 
poor Ecuadoreans from the highlands have a chance to thrive. We are a small 
country, and we need to grow." 
</P>
<P>
For the natives, such talk merely suggests further encroachment. Ruben 
Calapucha, a 28-year-old leader of the provincial Indian federation 
representing about 25,000 natives in the Napo area, reminded a visitor: "The 
land is our culture, our essence, our history, our survival." 
</P>
<P>
The native group is less concerned about colonists than the land agency and 
large companies. "We say that if a foreign company comes in and takes away our 
riches, then we at least want those companies to meet the many needs of these 
communities -- putting up schools, community centers, health clinics. We want 
the government to make these things part of the contract, Calapucha said." 
</P>
<P>
Even the save-the-Amazon movement has indirectly hurt the natives, Calapucha 
said. "They say this is the lung of the world, so they have created reserves 
where they won't give us titles. But we have been here for generations!" 
</P>
<P>
The population in the Amazon areas of Peru and Ecuador has surged at nearly 
double the national rate in the last 15 years, with the greatest growth right 
at the foot of the Andes and on the slopes of the mountains. That growth, and 
the discovery of oil in the late 1960s in both countries, nourished the 
off-and-on dream of conquering the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
One of the primary architects of the dream was former Peruvian President 
Fernando Belaunde Terry, who envisioned a highway, never built, through the 
western Amazon from Colombia to Paraguay. The concept reflected the importance 
of the Amazon to the countries whose mountains create it. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Belaunde's road would have passed through highland jungle and cloud 
forest on the slopes of the Andes. One portion of the road was built, through 
Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, with disastrous consequences. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent flight over the valley in a police helicopter, a visitor saw 
hundreds of plumes of smoke rising from the floor and precipices as farmers 
cleared new fields. If the past pattern holds, much of the space will be 
devoted to coca fields. 
</P>
<P>
The Upper Huallaga is the largest single source of the leaf used to make 
cocaine. Estimates of coca plantations there range as high as 450,000 acres, by 
far the largest crop in the Peruvian Amazon. Because it is illegal, although 
largely unmolested, coca is grown on the least suitable terrain, according to 
Marc J. Dourojeanni, a professor at the National Agrarian University in Lima. 
</P>
<P>
Bolivia, which contains about 12% of the Amazon basin, is the No. 2 coca 
producer after Peru, with much of its uplands jungle similarly affected. 
Colombia is a far smaller coca grower and under less jungle settlement 
pressure, but it has major cocaine-refining operations. 
</P>
<P>
Dourojeanni said in a report that coca fields alone may have caused 10% of 
Peru's deforestation in the Amazon in this century. 
</P>
<P>
"Ecologically, coca is located in some of the most fragile life zones of the 
country, some of which are the least apt for agriculture," he wrote. Coca is 
grown between 2,000 and 6,500 feet on unterraced hills, extremely susceptible 
to erosion. Some erosion is gradual, with up to 300 metric tons of soil washed 
away each year per 2.5 acres. Some is catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
Fatal Landslides 
</P>
<P>
Deadly landslides kill dozens, and sometimes hundreds, of people each year in 
Peru's valleys, often blocking roads for days. 
</P>
<P>
Coca growers use herbicides that wash into rivers, but far worse is the 
discharge of chemicals used in the refining process -- as much as 57 million 
liters of kerosene and 32 million liters of sulfuric acid per year in Peru. 
</P>
<P>
Two national forests and several parks have been partially invaded by coca. 
</P>
<P>
Dourojeanni noted that coca is being adapted to grow at lower altitudes, and 
new road construction could "disperse the coca growers through the entire 
Amazon region," just as the construction of the Jungle Highway in the Upper 
Huallaga by Belaunde brought coca to that area. 
</P>
<P>
As in Ecuador, Peruvian environmentalists blame conflicting policies and lack 
of government control. And many insist that the consequences of problems at the 
origins of the Amazon threaten its entire course to the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always harping about the lowland jungle and Brazil, but the cloud 
forests are twice as important," said Tony Luscombe, an American ecologist who 
has lived in Peru for years. "When you take off the trees, you start the 
erosion, which causes flash floods and clogs the rivers. Things are happening 
here with a vengeance, and nobody's raising a voice." 
</P>
<P>
Luscombe said oil companies are already having trouble moving materials by 
barge in some areas because silting from erosion had reduced river depths. 
</P>
<P>
"The government is giving incentives to get people roaring off into the jungle 
to avoid having to solve the problems in the sierra (mountains), where they 
originate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Caillaux Zazzali, president of the Peruvian Society of Environmental Law, 
complained that the Amazon Treaty signed by countries in the region has merely 
become a device to fight off industrialized countries who oppose Amazon 
destruction. He said the treaty needs teeth imposing obligations on each member 
and "forming the basis for planned and balanced development." 
</P>
<P>
If Peru pollutes upstream and thus hurts Brazil, the Brazilian government 
should be empowered under the treaty to force a response, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gustavo Suarez, technical director of Peru's Foundation for the Conservation of 
Nature, said that while Peru has taken steps to protect its forests through a 
national plan for sustained use, a contradictory law was passed in January 
pushing colonization and industrial development of the lowland jungle. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Suarez said, the government has ignored the repeatedly demonstrated 
fact that the paltry soils are unsuitable for cattle ranching and monoculture, 
or single-crop farming. With the new policy, "it is very probable that new 
areas will be opened for the cultivation of coca and drug-trafficking, 
especially after the colonists encounter impoverished soils and cannot sustain 
themselves any other way." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, to the relief of the environmental lobby, the government has set 
up a commission, including non-government and native groups, to draft a broader 
strategy for Amazon development. 
</P>
<P>
In the far southeastern corner of Peru, the Madre de Dios River region contains 
some of the richest and most diverse virgin rain forests of the Amazon. In the 
first expanse of flat jungle after the mountains and hills have subsided, 
immense trees form a canopy so thick that no photographs can be taken in the 
constant dusk below. 
</P>
<P>
Tree roots branch out like flukes 30 feet from the trunks of the largest trees. 
Native people know how to drink water from tree fruit and use wood chips as 
insect repellent. On the grounds of the riverside Cuzco Amazonico Lodge, an 
estimated 120 mammals roam, and one visiting scientist counted eight species of 
bats. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Dominguez, the lodge manager for the last 10 years, said growing 
eco-tourism has helped encourage protection of the Amazon by generating badly 
needed foreign income. But he worries about settlers who are pushing up against 
his borders. And he worries about the gold dredgers now appearing on the river. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I won't be alive, but someday. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez trailed off, leaving unspoken his fears for the future.

'PREEMIE' SURVIVAL LAGS, COULD STIR ABORTION DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There has been little improvement over the last seven years in the survival of 
the smallest and most premature babies, according to a study published today 
that may stoke the debate over the ethics of second-trimester abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The study found that about one in five infants born before 25 weeks' gestation 
-- or weighing less than about 26 ounces -- survived between 1985 and 1988. 
That rate was no better than the survival rate of similar babies born between 
1982 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
That rate was unchanged despite increasingly aggressive attempts to keep such 
newborns alive, the researchers found. But the average time until death rose 
from 73 hours to 880 hours among those infants transferred to neonatal 
intensive care. 
</P>
<P>
"Thus, although survival has not appreciably altered, in some instances we 
further postponed death by the futile continuation of respiratory support," the 
authors wrote in a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The findings, from Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in 
Cleveland, add new data to the debate over fetal viability -- the critical 
point at which an infant could survive outside the womb and at which the state 
may intervene to block an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
But the findings also raise questions about the ethics and economics of going 
to great lengths to salvage tiny infants unlikely to live: Amid attempts to 
control health care expenditures, is it right to try against the odds to save 
those babies? 
</P>
<P>
"This is a cutting edge issue," said Dr. Ezra Davidson, chairman of the 
department of obstetrics and gynecology at Drew University in Los Angeles. 
"(It) really poses a lot of ethical and medical problems in making a correct 
and comfortable decision." 
</P>
<P>
The researchers, Maureen Hack and Avroy A. Fanaroff, compared the cases of 98 
infants weighing less than 750 grams, or 26.4 ounces, delivered at McDonald 
Hospital for Women between mid-1982 and mid-1985, to 129 similar infants 
delivered between 1985 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The infants in the first group had been born after an average of 24.2 weeks' 
gestation. The average in the second group was 23.5 weeks. Babies of that 
weight and prematurity represent about 0.5% of all babies born in the United 
States, physicians said. 
</P>
<P>
The survival rate in the early 1980s was 20%. In the latter period, it was 18%. 
The rates were basically unchanged despite the fact that the percentage of 
infants resuscitated rose from 38% to 47% and the rate of Cesarean sections 
rose from 12% to 19%. 
</P>
<P>
(Physicians say Cesarean sections may be used in these cases in hopes of 
protecting fragile infants from the trauma of vaginal delivery. But the 
procedure pits the surgery risk to the mother against the benefit to an infant 
unlikely to survive.) 
</P>
<P>
"Thus, despite a tendency to perform more Cesarean sections and active 
resuscitations, no improvement in the survival of babies with lengths of 
gestation below 25 weeks or birth weights under 750 grams was observed," the 
researchers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
They said the probability of survival was even worse in the case of infants 
born after less than 24 weeks' gestation and weighing less than 600 grams. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers also tracked the development of some of the babies up to 20 
months after birth. They found that four out of 18 studied in the first group, 
and seven out of 14 in the second group had "moderate-to-severe 
neurodevelopmental impairment." 
</P>
<P>
The impairment ranged from blindness to paralysis and abnormal development of 
tissue. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the small numbers involved, the researchers were cautious about 
drawing conclusions from that sample. But they described the "trend toward an 
increase" in handicap "of serious concern." 
</P>
<P>
Asked Wednesday about the findings, opponents of abortion emphasized the fact 
that one in five infants had lived. They also noted that one infant survived 
after just 22 weeks' gestation -- two weeks less than the 24-week minimum often 
cited for viability. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the right to abortion emphasized the finding that survival among 
infants born at less than 25 weeks had not improved. They said that confirms 
their current position that viability generally occurs after no less than 24 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is considered significant because the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 
1973 that the state's right to regulate abortion -- by intervening to protect 
life -- begins at the point of viability. The court estimated that a fetus 
could survive after 24 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, they had a 22-weeker," Dr. John Willke, president of the National Right 
to Life Committee, said in a telephone interview Wednesday. "To all those 
distinguished scientists with their absolutism, well, say no more." 
</P>
<P>
"The one-in-five rate doesn't change my thinking or feeling about late 
second-trimester abortions," said Barbara Radford, executive director of the 
National Abortion Federation. "I do think it's really interesting that the 
survival rate hasn't changed in that decade." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, said the study's significance extends far beyond abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Al Jonsen, a professor of ethics in medicine at the University of Washington 
School of Medicine, said the findings raise the question of whether the science 
of saving premature babies has perhaps reached "some sort of physiological 
lower limit." 
</P>
<P>
The barrier to survival may no longer be simply the traditional problem of 
insufficiently developed lungs, he said. It may now be what Jonsen called "a 
complex of physiological under-development" and "the illness of not being 
finished." 
</P>
<P>
Jonsen said the findings raise two related, but separate, ethical questions: 
</P>
<P>
"Is it justifiable to continue research into salvaging babies at the lower end 
of the scale?" he wondered. "What about rescue efforts? Can we legitimately 
exclude the whole class of babies under a particular weight and gestational age 
from therapeutic rescue efforts?" 
</P>
<P>
The study's authors suggested their findings would be useful in guiding health 
care providers and administrators in making medical policy decisions, and also 
in counseling parents with "unrealistic expectations" about the ability of 
medicine to keep alive an immature infant outside of the womb.

PANEL OPENS A LOOPHOLE FOR POLITICAL JUNK MAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The state's campaign watchdog commission on Wednesday created a loophole in a 
voter-approved ban on mass mailings at public expense by allowing elected 
officials to mail unlimited numbers of "meeting notices" right up to election 
day. 
</P>
<P>
In reaching its decision, the Fair Political Practices Commission unanimously 
overruled its own staff, which in a memo to commissioners complained that the 
new regulation "contains very broad language . . . which could lead to abuse." 
</P>
<P>
The vote by the five-member panel was immediately attacked by one of the 
authors of Proposition 73, which imposed a flat-out ban on mass mailings at 
public expense. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra, an author of the 1988 
initiative, complained that the new regulation would also undermine the 1974 
Political Reform Act, which for 15 years has effectively barred incumbents from 
using mass mailings from the time they file for reelection up until election 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission is thumbing its nose at the will of the voters who have clearly 
spoken, in two statewide initiatives, that they don't want to pay for political 
junk mail," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
However, an FPPC spokesperson defended the decision, arguing that the 
commissioners were simply trying to interpret Proposition 73's ban on mass 
mailings in a way that would allow government to continue to contact citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"What the commission has tried to do is have the mass mailing restriction apply 
in a common sense way," said the FPPC's Sandra Michioku. 
</P>
<P>
If the five-member commission had not acted to broaden the ban by regulation, 
Michioku said, "an unintended result would have been to ban the sending out of 
tax bills and welfare checks." 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson complained that the new regulation created a "massive loophole." 
</P>
<P>
"When voters passed Proposition 73, they thought they were voting to eliminate 
outrageous political puff pieces mailed at taxpayer expense," Johnson said. 
"These so-called meeting notices are a well-known campaign tactic and have no 
business being paid for by the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
Until the passage of Proposition 73 in June, 1988, there were no restrictions 
on mass mailings at public expense except during election periods. Even then, 
incumbents could mail out official notices to constituents, but with 
restrictions on the types of mailings and how prominently the incumbent's name 
could be displayed. 
</P>
<P>
The new rule allows an incumbent officeholder to decide to hold a meeting on an 
issue and then send out thousands of notices to constituents, urging them to 
attend. The regulation does put restrictions on how often and prominently the 
elected official's name can be displayed on the notice. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC's Michioku said that the meeting notice exception was requested by 
local government officials, who wanted to be able to meet with constituents on 
such controversial issues as toxic waste. She said that commissioners have 
pledged to review their decision if they see evidence that elected officials 
are abusing the meeting notice rule.

FT. BRAGG -- 2 WOMEN ARE THE RIGHT STUFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
FT. BRAGG, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the 1940s the two women have been the mainstays of this quaint, isolated 
Northern California coastal town, an hour's drive from the nearest four-lane 
highway. One, a radio announcer, is the sounding board, and often the 
conscience, of the community. The other has headed up Paul Bunyan Days, Ft. 
Bragg's biggest annual event, since its inception on her ranch half a century 
ago, and keeps it going by sheer force of will. 
</P>
<P>
Both women are up in their years. Gertrude White, the rancher, is a lively 95. 
She looks and acts years younger. Eloise Keller, the radio announcer, known 
affectionately by townspeople as Aunt Elly, chooses not to tell her age. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of its isolation, Ft. Bragg has many traditional aspects no longer 
found in many other towns as America changes," noted Brooks Mencher, 33, editor 
of the weekly Ft. Bragg Advocate-News. The newspaper, like the town, is 100 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
"Eloise Keller and Gertrude White," Mencher added, "are prime examples of the 
unique flavor of our small community." 
</P>
<P>
Aldo (Moose) Mattiuzzo, 59, lifelong logger who is 6 feet 4 and weighs 380 
pounds, observed that "most of the town grew up with these two ladies. 
Everybody goes to Gertrude for advice and everybody calls Elly when she's on 
the air and talks about anything they want to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
Mattiuzzo's sentiments are echoed throughout Ft. Bragg, population 5,500, a 
place where fishing and a sawmill are the two biggest enterprises and the 
downtown business section is turn-of-the-century, one- and two-story frame 
buildings jammed together. 
</P>
<P>
For 40 years Aunt Elly has been on the air five days a week over KDAC, Ft. 
Bragg's AM station where ads go for $15 a minute and 12,000 listeners tune in 
for 50 miles up and down the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Some days I feel 105. Other days I feel 35," said the tiny, bent-over, 
gray-haired radio personality. She doesn't sound a day over 35 on the air. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know Elly's age. When I bought KDAC in 1960 she came with the 
station," said KDAC's owner, Charlie Stone, 66. The Art Deco radio building on 
a hill overlooking town has two Flash Gordon lightning bolts painted over its 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Eloise Keller has an hour-long talk show every morning at 9 and a half-hour 
interview show at 5:30 in the afternoon. When people call in they never give 
their names, but Elly knows most of them anyway by their voices. She never gets 
rattled, feels everybody is entitled to an opinion. Callers phone in to discuss 
everything from recipes to international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent morning a woman with parakeets tweeting in the background called 
about caring for the less fortunate. "Her parakeets always chirp along with 
her," said Keller. A logger called from a pay phone. Traffic could be heard in 
the background. 
</P>
<P>
A retired teacher phoned to talk about El Salvador and the president of the 
local Republican Women's Club called to talk about communism. 
</P>
<P>
"Elly," said the Republican lady, "Don't ever forget: When shrimps learn to 
whistle, communism will die.". 
</P>
<P>
"Elly has touched the lives of everyone around here," said the radio station 
owner. "She has campaigned for more things in this town. When Ft. Bragg needed 
a new hospital, Elly went on the air and campaigned for the hospital until we 
got it. When the Fire Department needed a new ladder truck, it was Elly who led 
the drive to get it. The fire chief drove out to the station to give her the 
first ride in the truck." 
</P>
<P>
A wall at the radio station is filled with plaques honoring Keller, one from 
every organization in town, several statewide awards for special radio programs 
she produced. For years she read children's stories over the air. That's when 
they started calling her Aunt Elly. 
</P>
<P>
She had never broadcast anything in her life when she called KDAC in 1949 to 
compliment the station for a women's program it aired shortly after she moved 
here from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul Singer was manager of the station at the time. He told me the lady doing 
the show devoted to women's issues had left the station that day and he was 
looking for someone to take her place. He told me he liked my voice and asked 
if I would do it. That was on a Friday. I went to work for the station on 
Monday and I have been here ever since," Keller recalled. 
</P>
<P>
For 60 years Gertrude White has been caring for dairy and beef cattle (20 head 
of beef cattle at present) on her 70-acre ranch. For 50 years she has operated 
a riding stable and taught horsemanship. She has a stubborn streak. She won't 
let anyone take her picture. 
</P>
<P>
White rode a horse every year in the Paul Bunyan Days parade, the popular event 
she started, until she was 90. The horse she owned at the time died and she did 
not get another one. She has been riding on the fire truck in the parade ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
All through the 1930s, '40s and '50s, Ft. Bragg received most of its milk from 
the dairy owned and operated by this hearty ranch woman. She has led and been 
the cook and chief bottle washer on an annual three-day trail ride sponsored by 
her riding club for the last 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
She shows up at almost every function in town, especially when there is a 
dance. "I'm considered the best dancer in Ft. Bragg and there are a lot of good 
dancers here," she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"I do as I damn well please and I have no intention of slowing down," she said. 
She has been a widow for years. She told of owning 24 cars in her lifetime, the 
first an Overland in 1912. He last six have been Cadillacs. 
</P>
<P>
"My present car is a 1976 Cadillac with 28,000 miles. The original tires are 
still on it. I think I will keep it for a while. I haven't had a ticket or an 
accident in my life. I took my driver's license test (again) last year and my 
license was renewed for four years," White said. She lives by herself in a 
weather-beaten old farmhouse overlooking the sea.

SCORES OF IDEAS FLOW FROM STATE'S 'EDUCATION SUMMIT'

Participants in California's "education summit" hurtled through a crash course 
in agenda-setting Wednesday, offering up scores of ideas for fixing the public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
The ideas, in the form of recommended courses of action, were pounded out in 
two days by seven committees of California educators, parents, business leaders 
and legislators. When refined and distilled over the next two to three weeks, 
they will form the basis of a plan for California's schools over the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
The final recommendations of the 300-member summit group also will be forwarded 
to Gov. George Deukmejian, who will include them with the ideas he will take to 
Governor's Task Force on Education when it reconvenes in February. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that many of the ideas are controversial or costly, state Supt. of 
Public Instruction Bill Honig told summit participants Wednesday that he needs 
some consensus on what course to take. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could put (all of the committees' recommendations) into practice, we'd 
be a lot better off in California," Honig said, "but some of them are going to 
be controversial, and I'd like to hear your views." 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of some of the recommendations: 
</P>
<P>
* Decreasing the level of adult illiteracy by 5% each year over the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
* Integrating such community services as welfare and public health with the 
school systems to help children with "outside" problems that keep them from 
learning. 
</P>
<P>
* Spending $50 million a year on beefed-up math and science programs. 
</P>
<P>
* Extending the teachers' work year to provide for planning and staff 
development. 
</P>
<P>
* "Dramatically" increasing efforts to recruit minorities into the education 
profession at all levels. 
</P>
<P>
* Revamping testing methods in several ways, including making student 
assessments more closely tied to "real-world" skills. 
</P>
<P>
When workshop leaders summarized their group's ideas at the end of the summit, 
they sparked sometimes lively debate. 
</P>
<P>
And they drew an uncharacteristically passionate plea from Leonard Britton, 
superintendent of the massive Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that children at many of California's urban schools are staggering under 
overwhelming burdens of poverty, overcrowding, gangs, drugs and limited 
proficiency in English, Britton urged the group to press for more funds. 
</P>
<P>
"I encourage you and the governor to speak up for all the children in this 
state," Britton said to cheers and applause. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what we need to do," said San Jose teacher Claire Pelton, leader of 
the workshop on teacher preparation and recruitment. "It's a question of 
developing the political will to jump those barriers." 
</P>
<P>
Participants worked furiously to plan recommended strategies in the seven 
areas, which were based on the broad outlines drawn at the first-ever national 
summit on education last fall. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the workshop discussing ways to restructure schools broke into 
subgroups and pasted on the walls of their conference room large, hand-lettered 
outlines of their agendas and issues to be decided. 
</P>
<P>
Joan-Marie Shelley, president of the San Francisco Federation of Teachers, said 
she was "pleasantly surprised at the extent of agreement reached by a very 
diverse group of people. . . . It seems to be a process that is working 
surprisingly well." 
</P>
<P>
California's "Teacher of Year," Janis T. Gabay of Serra High School in San 
Diego, said she, too, was pleased at the number of good ideas that came out of 
her workshop on getting high school students ready for college or the 
workplace. But she acknowledged the difficulties of coming up with plans that 
work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
Over the next two to three weeks, state education officials will distill 
recommendations for improving public schools from the ideas put forth at the 
education summit. The recommendations will be forwarded to Gov. George 
Deukmejian, who will take them to the national Governors' Task Force on 
Education when it reconvenes in February. The governors' group is working on 
specific national goals and strategies for achieving them, as called for by 
President Bush and the governors last September.

Muslim separatists freed the daughter of a Cabinet minister Wednesday after the 
government released five of their jailed comrades, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Rubaiya Sayeed, daughter of Home Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, was taken to a 
friend's home in this northern city two hours after the militants were freed 
downtown, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Rubaiya Sayeed, 22, was flown to New Delhi later and met at the airport by her 
father, mother, brother and sister. 
</P>
<P>
Young Muslim men celebrated the militants' release by shooting off firecrackers 
in Srinagar, summer capital of India's northernmost state of Jammu and Kashmir, 
which borders Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
About 3,000 people shouted anti-India slogans and waved the national flag of 
Pakistan, which has fought three wars with India over Kashmir since both 
nations gained independence from Britain in 1947. A cease-fire line monitored 
by the United Nations separates the state into Indian and Pakistani territory. 
</P>
<P>
Rubaiya Sayeed was abducted at gunpoint Friday as she was going home from her 
job at a Srinagar hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The Kashmir Liberation Front, which demands secession from India of the mainly 
Muslim state, claimed responsibility for the abduction. Its chairman said the 
group might try other kidnapings in its campaign against the Hindu-dominated 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The kidnapers had threatened to kill their captive if their colleagues were not 
freed. 
</P>
<P>
Sayeed is the first Muslim to head the Home Ministry, which is in charge of 
internal security. The appointment was seen as part of Prime Minister 
Vishwanath Pratap Singh's efforts to appease Muslims, who bore the brunt of 
Hindu-Muslim riots that claimed more than 300 lives this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The kidnaping was the first crisis for Singh, a Hindu who took office Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Sayeed said that solving the militant campaign in Jammu and Kashmir is the 
government's "No. 1 priority program." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a complete collapse of law and order in the state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The freed militants included Abdul Hamid Sheik, a top leader of the Kashmir 
Liberation Front. Sheik, who was wounded in a clash with police last month and 
arrested, was taken by ambulance from a Srinagar hospital and handed over to 
his organization. 
</P>
<P>
The Kashmir Liberation Front, formed in 1965, wants Jammu and Kashmir, India's 
only Muslim-majority state, to become independent or part of predominantly 
Muslim Pakistan.

ECONOMIC CRISIS SEEN AS THREAT TO ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT; 
</P>
<P>
SOUTH AMERICA: CURRENCY IS DEVALUED IN AN EFFORT TO STEM THE TIDE. THE WHITE 
HOUSE REACTS CAUTIOUSLY.

<P>
Argentina has plunged into an economic crisis that analysts here fear could 
ultimately threaten the stability of the government of its new Peronist 
president, Carlos Saul Menem. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden decline of the Argentine economy over the past several days has 
reportedly led to incidents of civil unrest. Railroad workers began a 
nationwide strike Wednesday. There were reports of bus-burnings and other 
violence in Buenos Aires and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
The economic situation appears to be worsening almost by the hour. Capital 
flight has intensified sharply. Wages are running out of control. Inflation is 
wreaking havoc. Food prices soared between 25% and 200% after an easing of 
price controls last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, in a last-ditch effort to stem the tide, the government devalued the 
Argentine currency by 35%, from an official exchange rate of 650 australs to 
the dollar to 1,000, and by Wednesday it was trading informally at 1,350. 
</P>
<P>
The increasing instability has alarmed some U.S. policy-makers and private 
analysts, who fear the turmoil is becoming so deeply rooted that it is 
threatening the Menem government. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Treasury official is due in Buenos Aires this week, ostensibly as part 
of a trip that includes visits to several Latin American countries. Some 
analysts expect Menem to seek a short-term loan from the United States to help 
head off any run on Argentina's dwindling reserves. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, the Bush Administration appears to be reacting cautiously. The 
White House National Security Council and intelligence agencies are reported to 
be following the situation closely, but the White House has yet to authorize 
any action. 
</P>
<P>
The chaotic situation is the culmination of a steady deterioration in the 
economy since early last summer, when Menem assumed power early from President 
Raul Alfonsin, who was the first democratically elected Argentine president in 
modern times. 
</P>
<P>
A wage-and-price control program that held wages down more firmly than prices 
eventually cost Menem the support of organized labor, which split over whether 
to continue cooperating with the new government. When labor balked, capital 
flight mushroomed and the austral plunged. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden collapse of the past several days followed Menem's declaration last 
weekend of a moratorium on servicing domestic debt. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, government officials scrambled desperately to try to enlist the 
support of business, labor and the country's disparate political parties in 
forging a new social compact. e But it was facing an uphill fight. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina has not been totally without Western help. On Nov. 13, the 
Washington-based International Monetary Fund approved a $1.4-billion loan to 
Buenos Aires. Less than two weeks later, the country's central bank president 
resigned, charging interference by Menem aides. 
</P>
<P>
Menem's initial program also was endorsed by the Bush Administration, which 
hailed it as a step in the right direction. However, Argentina still has not 
qualified for help under the Brady Plan, the new debt-reduction program 
outlined by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. 
</P>
<P>
An Argentine effort to reduce government borrowing by converting inefficient 
state-owned industries to private firms also has foundered. Argentina has not 
paid interest on its loans from U.S. and other foreign banks in 20 months, and 
is now about $5 billion in arrears. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina repeatedly has promised the IMF that it will reduce government 
spending. Its latest agreement with IMF pledges to slash the nation's budget 
deficit to 1.25% of the country's total output next year, from 16% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But as late as last August, the budget deficit as a percentage of national 
output had increased from its 1988 level, and analysts here say it appears to 
be headed even higher in the face of the current turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Alan J. Stoga, international economic analyst for Kissinger Associates, notes 
that December and January usually are quiet months politically because it is 
the vacation season. "The toppling of Alfonsin's government actually began in 
February," Stoga said. 
</P>
<P>
But the situation is deteriorating so rapidly that many analysts believe Menem 
may not have the luxury of the traditional December-January hiatus and will 
have to act quickly or face a serious threat to his ability to govern. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got to break the circle and regain credibility," Stoga said Wednesday. 
"It's do-able, but very difficult."

EAST BLOC: CENTRAL COMMITTEE ALSO OUSTS DISGRACED LEADER TODOR ZHIVKOV AND HIS 
SON.

<P>
The ruling Communist Party, responding to increasing popular calls for change, 
Wednesday renounced its leading role in running Bulgaria and expelled disgraced 
former leader Todor Zhivkov and two former Politburo members. 
</P>
<P>
The official BTA news agency said that the party's policy-making Central 
Committee met and decided to ask the National Assembly to repeal two clauses in 
the constitution that empower the Communists with the "construction of an 
advanced socialist society." 
</P>
<P>
"The Bulgarian Communist Party renounces its leading role in society and 
state," BTA said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Central Committee decided to expel Zhivkov, his son Vladimir, and 
Milko Balev, who was Zhivkov's private secretary for many years. The latter two 
were widely regarded as close Zhivkov allies and architects of his hard-line 
policies, the news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The announcements came on the third day of the Central Committee meeting in 
Sofia, convened under new party leader Petar Mladenov to discuss its response 
to further calls for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's ruling Communists, eager not to lag behind in the whirlwind of 
change sweeping Eastern Europe, followed similar moves by the East German and 
Czechoslovak Communist parties in voting themselves out of power. 
</P>
<P>
The official news agency said the proposal to repeal the two clauses of the 
constitution would be put to the Communist-dominated National Assembly at a 
session today. 
</P>
<P>
The two clauses read: "The Bulgarian Communist Party is the leading force in 
society and in the state" and "The Bulgarian Communist Party heads the 
construction of an advanced socialist society in the People's Republic of 
Bulgaria in close cooperation with the Bulgarian Agrarian Party" -- the last a 
reference to the only other officially sanctioned party here. 
</P>
<P>
With today's dismissal, the 78-year-old Zhivkov, who ruled Bulgaria for 35 
years, loses the last of his Communist Party identity. Ousted as party leader 
and head of state last month, he was expelled from the Central Committee in a 
second party house-cleaning last week. 
</P>
<P>
Zhivkov has come under increasing attack for alleged mismanagement, corruption 
and dictatorial rule. In this drab workers' state, he has been accused publicly 
of living lavishly in 13 opulent official residences and six hunting lodges. 
Officials have said the buildings will be turned over to the public. 
</P>
<P>
His 37-year-old son Vladimir was responsible for the party's culture 
department. He and Balev were jettisoned from the Politburo in the November 
purge. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats in Sofia said the fact that the Zhivkovs and Balev have now 
been expelled from the party means they could go on trial. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party has been buffeted by personnel and policy changes since 
Mladenov took over, but opposition groups are seeking further reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Bowing to demands, Mladenov promised Monday to hold free parliamentary 
elections, talk with the opposition and end the party's guaranteed monopoly on 
power. 
</P>
<P>
But many opposition activists still want the entire Central Committee to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Bulgarian Radio said Petar Dyulgerov, president of the 
official trade union, had asked to be relieved of his position as a non-voting 
Politburo member. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether Dyulgerov, also regarded as a Zhivkov ally, would 
retain his Central Committee membership. 
</P>
<P>
But the radio later said Mladenov had refused Dyulgerov's resignation, telling 
the plenum, "It is not expedient for the party to accept his proposal at the 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
A number of Central Committee members, including Foreign Minister Boyko 
Dimitrov, have also called for a further cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing at the moment that can help the people to trust the 
party is to clean its ranks of active supporters of the command-administrative 
system," one of the members, Boris Tsvetkov, told the plenum. 
</P>
<P>
As the Central Committee meeting drew to a close, a crowd estimated by Western 
reporters at 60,000 gathered in the plaza outside to show support in a rally 
sponsored by the party. Signs hoisted above the throng read, "A Bulgarian 
Communist Party of Untainted People" and "Together With the Bulgarian Communist 
Party for New Democratic Communist Socialism." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, outside the Alexander Nevsky Orthodox Cathedral, about 2,000 people 
applauded a speaker from the Agrarian Party, which has long taken a back seat 
to the Communists. "Today we end this semi-existence," the speaker declared. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, more than 50,000 people demonstrated in Sofia, chanting calls for 
reform and dialogue between the Communists and the opposition. It was the 
largest pro-democracy display since the Communists consolidated power in 1946.

PRAGUE NEGOTIATORS AGREE TO RESTRUCTURE PARLIAMENT 
</P>

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a further retreat for Czechoslovakia's once-dominant Communist Party, 
negotiators for the nation's major political forces agreed late Wednesday on a 
plan to restructure the nation's Parliament, potentially depriving dozens of 
Communist lawmakers of their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, struck in a series of back-room meetings between leaders of the 
Communists, the main Civic Forum opposition group and several smaller political 
parties, appears to reject a Communist plan, floated Tuesday, for the nation's 
president to be chosen by a national election rather than by the Federal 
Assembly, the Czechoslovak Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The Communists had proposed the direct nationwide vote as a way of blocking the 
presidential candidacy of opposition leader Vaclav Havel. Opposition groups had 
favored a vote in Parliament over a national election because the Communists 
retain a massive organizational edge over them, particularly in provincial 
areas outside Prague. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition strategist Jan Urban said Wednesday that "basic agreement" has been 
reached on a deal but that further negotiations will be needed before a final 
package could be announced, possibly as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
But, Urban said, the Communists had agreed to engineer the resignations of 
perhaps as many as a quarter of the members of the Parliament, which is 
dominated by loyal party functionaries. The newly created vacancies will be 
filled by delegates appointed by party leaders in consultation with the 
opposition. Those delegates will serve until elections are held in the spring 
or early summer. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring is designed to ensure that hard-line Communist lawmakers no 
longer can delay or block reform legislation proposed by the government. The 
changes would also allow the Parliament to proceed with the presidential 
election in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
The presidency has been open since Communist President Gustav Husak resigned 
Sunday after swearing in the nation's new government -- the first in four 
decades not controlled by the Communists.

Havel remains the favorite for the presidency. The two other men who have most 
actively sought the job, former Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec and Alexander 
Dubcek, the leader of the nation's 1968 reform movement, were both effectively 
ruled out last week when all parties agreed that the presidency should go to a 
non-communist and a Czech. Adamec is a party member and Dubcek is a Slovak, as 
is the country's new prime minister, Marian Calfa. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth candidate, Cestmir Cisar, who served as a senior official in Dubcek's 
government, has mounted a campaign but appears to have generated little 
support. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum leaders, however, would not rule out on Wednesday the possibility 
that they would agree to accept a compromise candidate other than Havel as part 
of a package to restructure the legislature.

DEBT SWAPPING FURTHERS CONSERVATION CAUSE IN FORESTS OF ECUADOR, COSTA RICA AND 
BOLIVIA 
</P>

<P>
Latin America's huge foreign debt, a crushing burden in every country, has 
brought a Midas-like windfall for nature conservation in three small nations 
seeking to protect their tropical rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
Ecuador, Costa Rica and Bolivia have swapped tiny portions of their debts for 
foreign investment in environmental projects, most of them aimed at saving the 
region's jungle areas. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, the hard cash donated from abroad has had an impact far out of 
proportion to the initial investment, thanks to the multiplier effect of such 
swaps. 
</P>
<P>
The concept has some built-in dangers for the debtor countries, principally the 
risk of fueling inflation and jeopardizing broader debt renegotiations, so the 
programs are unlikely to reach a major scale. Still, they are already funding 
some substantial environmental projects. 
</P>
<P>
Ecuador, which has signed swaps worth $10 million in debt, and Costa Rica, at 
$11 million, are by far the biggest nature dealers. Bolivia's program is far 
smaller, at $650,000, but it has funded a major expansion of the Beni Biosphere 
Reserve, an important flood plain for the Amazon basin. The swaps involve a 
minuscule fraction of Latin America's $400-billion-plus total debt. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1988, Costa Rica arranged donations from a range of international 
environmental groups for an initial $547,000 to buy $3.3 million in debt, 
reflecting the market's discount value of the debt. Further programs have 
followed, and more are planned. The interest from the bonds purchased with the 
funds is being used to protect Costa Rica's natural parks, which include tracts 
of Central American rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's Nature Foundation, an influential non-governmental organization, has 
coordinated the effort here. The first swap, involving the purchase of $1 
million of debt, took place in March, 1988, and a second package worth $9 
million more was completed this year, with "investments" by the World Wildlife 
Fund and Nature Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Cash donations of well under $2 million bought the whole $10 million worth of 
debt because of the discount offered by banks eager to unload unpaid debt. The 
bonds purchased pay interest twice a year, and with Ecuadorean rates at 36% 
annually, the return will be substantial. 
</P>
<P>
The income next year will fund programs including a ecological data bank; 
protection of national parks, including the Galapagos Islands, Amazonian areas 
and endangered cloud forests on the slopes of the Andes, and training and 
education programs. 
</P>
<P>
"This covers our needs for protected areas for the next eight to 10 years," 
said Gonzalo Oviedo, who handles debt swaps for the Nature Foundation. "But in 
my opinion, at least for the foundation, the debt-swap chapter is already 
practically closed." 
</P>
<P>
Oviedo said the government is concerned about the inflationary impact of such 
swaps because they increase the amount of local currency in circulation. The 
dollars never actually reach Ecuador; foreign donors pay foreign banks that 
hold the debt, and the Ecuadorean government then issues matching bonds in 
local currency -- a form of printing money. 
</P>
<P>
Another risk is political: By accepting the notion of such swaps, the 
government may prejudice its ability to renegotiate its foreign debt on 
favorable terms. Oviedo said that swapping debt is an acknowledgment that it 
should be paid in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, to pay their debts, poor nations often are forced to adopt 
export-oriented policies that produce severe environmental damage, Oviedo 
argued. Deforestation, for example, can result from logging, agriculture and 
oil exploration fueled by the need to generate export earnings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Nature Foundation believes it is absurd to pay the debt," Oviedo said. "I 
believe that in a few years, there will not even be any point in negotiating on 
the debt, and swaps will become meaningless. But in the meantime, we might as 
well seek ways to generate resources for nature conservation."

An anti-crime initiative that sparked debate over whether it threatens the 
right to abortion was certified in Sacramento for the June statewide ballot. 
Secretary of State March Fong Eu said the proposed crime victims justice reform 
act got 665,162 valid signatures, almost 70,000 more than needed. The 
initiative, backed by Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.), is opposed by Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp, a Democrat and possible rival of Wilson in the 1990 
gubernatorial race. Van de Kamp says a provision removing the right-to-privacy 
guarantee could be used to repeal legal protection for abortions. Wilson 
disagrees.

The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld denial of political asylum to an 
Egyptian citizen who said he was persecuted at home by Muslims because he is a 
Coptic Christian. Amir Ghobrial had told the Board of Immigration Appeals of 
being stoned at age 14 by Muslims and of being beaten while a university 
student. He testified that Christians in Egypt fear attending church and 
wearing crosses, and their churches are sometimes bombed or burned. However, 
the court ruled that "Evidence of widespread tensions and generalized violence 
between Muslims and Christians in Egypt does not establish a well-founded fear 
of persecution."

As many as 600 underground tanks in the Fresno area are leaking and city 
workers are identifying the contents of 100 of those to determine if they pose 
any threat to ground water, officials said. "Some of them could contain 
chemicals that contaminate the ground water, and some could contaminate the 
soil," said Martin McIntyre, the city's water quality supervisor. About 3,000 
underground tanks are buried in the Fresno area, most of which are storage for 
gas stations or processing tanks for dry-cleaners, McIntyre said. The area 
around the tanks is monitored for any of 90 chemicals, including the pesticide 
DBCP and a dry-cleaning solution. Chemicals believed to have leaked from the 
tanks have been found in 108 of the city's 235 water wells in the last year, 
McIntyre said.

A Texas appeals court set aside the conviction of Death Row inmate Clarence Lee 
Brandley, more than two years after a judge ruled the black man was unfairly 
tried in the slaying of a white teen-ager. Brandley, 38, spent nearly nine 
years on Death Row. He was convicted of the 1980 strangulation and rape of a 
teen-ager at Conroe High School, where Brandley was a janitor. The court said 
the state's investigation of the slaying led to a trial that lacked "the 
rudiments of fairness" and ordered Brandley released to the custody of the 
Montgomery County sheriff for a possible new trial.

The U.S. Department of Energy has made an unprecedented decision to release 
plutonium production figures covering 1944 to 1960 at the Hanford nuclear 
reservation in Richland, Wash. The data had been requested by a panel of 
scientists overseeing a study of possible health effects from past radiation 
releases at Hanford. Figures on the production of plutonium, a key ingredient 
of nuclear weapons, have long been among the nation's most closely guarded 
secrets because it was thought they could help an enemy determine the size of 
the nation's nuclear stockpile.

Ex-Marine Oliver North spent a second day in court sparring with prosecutors in 
an effort to avoid testifying in the Iran-Contra trial of his ex-boss, retired 
Rear Adm. John Poindexter. Judge Harold Greene, who has scheduled Poindexter's 
trial to open Jan. 22, did not rule on whether North will be required to 
appear, but exchanges in court suggested North would be compelled to testify. 
Of Poindexter's nationally televised testimony to a congressional committee, 
North said: "He was the only one of all the witnesses at the hearing who didn't 
hang Ollie North out to dry." North says his perceptions of the secret 
arms-and-aid scandal were influenced by Poindexter's July, 1987, testimony.

Internal Revenue Service tax packages that are being mailed to millions of 
Americans contain instructions to pay the special surtax for Medicare's 
catastrophic health care program even though Congress repealed the surtax 
retroactively, Rep. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los Angeles) said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Roybal asked the IRS and the Social Security Administration to send out a 
special mailing advising taxpayers to ignore the line calling for calculation 
of the surtax, which would have been owed by Medicare beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS forms were printed before Congress voted last month to repeal the law. 
President Bush signed the repeal legislation Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply concerned that the basic forms still instruct Medicare 
beneficiaries to pay the . . . surtax and will confuse many Medicare 
beneficiaries," Roybal said in a letter to IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"While I understand that you are planning public service announcements . . . I 
am concerned that this may be inadequate," Roybal wrote to Goldberg. "I would 
suggest that you, along with the Social Security Administration, consider 
sending information directly to Medicare beneficiaries notifying them of the 
repeal."

HARTWIG SHIPMATE DEFENDS HIM AS NO 'SUICIDAL FREAK'

Gunner's Mate Kendall L. Truitt told Congress on Wednesday that former crew 
mate Clayton M. Hartwig was no "suicidal freak" and did not cause the explosion 
that killed Hartwig and 46 other sailors on the battleship Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Truitt accused the Navy of using "a big cover-up" to thwart theories that the 
shipboard explosion was accidental rather than caused intentionally, "most 
likely" by Hartwig, as the Navy has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Nicholas Mavroules (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Armed Services 
subcommittee on investigations, also has been critical of the Navy's report. 
And at the end of the hearing he told Vice Adm. Joseph S. Donnell III, "You've 
pointed your finger when there's that little chance" that the explosion was 
accidental. 
</P>
<P>
"Wouldn't you have been better off to say we don't know?" the congressman 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
Donnell said the Navy believes "we do know" that Hartwig most likely caused the 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Truitt said Hartwig was not told until the morning of April 19 that he was 
going to be positioned at center gun in the No. 2 gun turret, "so there would 
have been no time for planning" a suicide explosion. He said Hartwig had once 
talked of suicide, but Truitt said he did not take him seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Truitt said his own theory is that the blast was caused by a defective 
hydraulic rammer -- the piece of equipment used to shove the powder bags up 
against the projectile in the huge gun. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had had a problem with a rammer on the left gun in the No. 2 gun 
turret about a year earlier, describing it as behaving like a transmission 
stuck between neutral and drive. He theorized that the rammer might have 
"suddenly taken off," putting too much pressure on the propellant. 
</P>
<P>
He also maintained that gunpowder on the Iowa had been stored in high heat, 
that the cans were not airtight, and that "you could smell ether" when entering 
a powder storage area. Truitt said the fact that the crew mates working closest 
to the center gun had not gone through the exercise together before "may have 
been a contributing factor" in the blast. 
</P>
<P>
Questioned about his personal relationship with Hartwig, Truitt said they had a 
basically strong friendship, with occasional quarrels. Under questioning, he 
denied that they had ever been homosexual lovers. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy's official report on the Iowa accident made no mention of a possible 
homosexual link between the two, although there had been earlier news reports 
that Naval Investigative Service agents were pursuing such a theory.

SOVIET SCIENTISTS TO VISIT 2 KEY 'STAR WARS' LABS;

A delegation of top Soviet scientists, led by the chief negotiator at the 
strategic arms reduction talks in Geneva, will arrive Friday in Southern 
California for an unprecedented tour of a sensitive "Star Wars" research 
facility near San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets' two-day visit to Orange County will be shrouded in secrecy. Except 
for a brief picture-taking session when the 10-member delegation touches down 
at the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station at El Toro, neither the press nor the 
public is invited to take part. 
</P>
<P>
"This is essentially an extension of the (Geneva) talks," a senior Bush 
Administration official said Wednesday. "Those talks are confidential between 
the two governments." 
</P>
<P>
Three senior U.S. officials discussed the week-long Soviet visit to the United 
States at a briefing Wednesday, but they spoke on the condition that they not 
be identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to touring TRW Inc.'s Strategic Defense Initiative research 
facility on Saturday, the Soviets will spend two days early next week at the 
Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where other SDI research is in 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
Also known as "Star Wars," the SDI program would create a partial shield 
against incoming nuclear ballistic missiles in part by stationing powerful 
lasers and other high-tech weaponry on rockets and satellites. The Soviet Union 
in recent years has been conducting similar research. 
</P>
<P>
At the TRW Capistrano Test Site, located on 2,000 acres of unincorporated land, 
the Soviet scientists will inspect a powerful chemical laser. 
</P>
<P>
Currently in the early stages of development, the laser eventually could be 
enlarged and installed on a space-based platform to test its ability to detect 
and destroy incoming ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads. Such tests 
are planned for the middle to late 1990s, according to the Strategic Defense 
Initiative Organization, the Defense Department unit that oversees the project. 
</P>
<P>
At the Los Alamos laboratory, the Soviet delegation will examine a project to 
develop rocket-mounted devices that would generate powerful beams of atomic 
particles intended to either identify or destroy incoming missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Neither project is classified, but this is the first time that Soviet 
scientists will be permitted to inspect the SDI laboratories where American 
scientists are working and the hardware they are working on, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet visit is scheduled to begin less than two weeks after the United 
States laid on the table in Geneva a proposal for a new Defense in Space 
Treaty. The proposed treaty is an attempt to set ground rules for development 
of space-based defense systems. 
</P>
<P>
A key element of the U.S. proposal is reciprocal laboratory visits, in addition 
to mutual observation of tests, annual data exchanges and joint briefings, one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
The tour of the two SDI research units, another official said, is intended to 
demonstrate to the Soviets how reciprocal visits might work. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that visits to laboratories are essential if the sides are to gain 
an early and wide window into each other's research activities," the official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet official who will lead eight scientists and a Soviet Foreign 
Ministry official on the two SDI tours is Ambassador Yuri Nazarkin, head of the 
Soviet delegation to strategic arms and space defense talks in Geneva. The 
negotiations include both weapons in space and the strategic arms reduction 
talks (START). 
</P>
<P>
The American invitation was extended last September by Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III during a meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The Soviets so far have not invited American 
scientists to visit any of their space defense research facilities. 
</P>
<P>
As originally proposed by President Ronald Reagan in 1983, SDI would have 
shielded the nation with an impenetrable blanket of space-based defenses.

NAVY WARNS OFF GREENPEACE BEFORE SECOND SUCCESSFUL TRIDENT LAUNCH

The crew of the nuclear submarine Tennessee successfully launched a Trident 2 
missile Wednesday after the Navy warned Greenpeace anti-nuclear protesters to 
stay out of the safety zone, the Navy reported. 
</P>
<P>
The launch was the second straight successful undersea test-firing of the 
Navy's newest and deadliest nuclear weapon, keeping it on track for deployment 
next March. Two of the first three submarine tests failed. 
</P>
<P>
The Tennessee was cruising submerged in the Atlantic about 50 miles offshore 
when the 44-foot, $26.5-million missile burst out of a launch tube, broke the 
surface, ignited and hurled a dummy warhead to an undisclosed ocean target 
several thousand miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy reported several minutes later that the test was successful. 
</P>
<P>
"Another great day for the Navy," said Vice Admiral Roger F. Bacon, commander 
of the Atlantic submarine fleet. 
</P>
<P>
A 60-foot Greenpeace ketch, the Mondeivitano, briefly penetrated the launch 
safety zone but withdrew after a Navy ship warned it to move away. As a 
precaution, six Coast Guard cutters patrolled the perimeter of the 5,000-yard 
safety area around the submarine. 
</P>
<P>
"We made our point that we have a right to protest in international waters," 
Greenpeace spokeswoman Shannon Fagan said. "We will take our fight to Congress 
in an effort to have this missile system canceled. The world can no longer 
afford the waste of precious resources on weapons of mass destruction like the 
Trident 2." 
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace protesters tried to halt a Trident 2 launch on Dec. 4 by sending the 
190-foot vessel MV Greenpeace, with 25 people aboard, into the Tennessee's 
safety zone. A Navy ship intercepted the vessel and damaged it by repeatedly 
bumping it and using fire hoses to shoot water down the smokestacks, stopping 
the engines.

OLDENBURG IS CONVICTED OF 1 FRAUD COUNT

<P>
A U.S. District Court jury convicted financier J. William Oldenburg Wednesday 
of one count in a $26.5-million savings and loan fraud case but deadlocked on 
six other counts and was dismissed by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Joseph Russionello contended in the five-week trial that Oldenburg 
bilked the since-failed State Savings of Salt Lake City, which he controlled, 
by causing the thrift to buy a 363-acre Richmond, Calif., land parcel for $26.5 
million in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The parcel was owned by another Oldenburg firm, Investment Mortgage 
International, of San Francisco, which was in financial trouble. The property 
had been acquired in 1979 for about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The jurors convicted Oldenburg, 51, who once owned the Los Angeles Express of 
the now-defunct U.S. Football League, of the single count and told U.S. 
District Judge F. Lynch that after four days of deliberations, there was no 
reason to continue seeking unanimous agreement on the other counts. 
</P>
<P>
The single count was for knowingly making a false entry in the minutes of a 
meeting of State Savings' board of directors. The entry was said to be false 
because it omitted a reference to $10 million transmitted to Oldenburg's San 
Francisco firm as part of the real estate transaction. 
</P>
<P>
After they were dismissed, jurors Walter Threadgill of Pinole and Tami Mirner 
of Martinez said the jurors split 9 to 3 for conviction on all single remaining 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
They said the minority was not persuaded that in his various transactions 
Oldenburg had the intent to defraud. 
</P>
<P>
With a 9-3 vote, Russoniello said there was "a strong probability" he will seek 
a retrial on the six deadlocked counts. On the one-count conviction, Oldenburg 
faces a possible five-year prison term and a $10,000 fine. The judge set Feb. 9 
for sentencing.

The U.S. Navy blew up china, but it wasn't an international incident. 
</P>
<P>
A Christmas gift of fine English china was blasted into small pieces after 
officers on this Atlantic Ocean island suspected that the box in which it was 
delivered carried a bomb, the base commander said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Security guards became suspicious when Tiller Ming, 70, a delivery man for the 
prestigious Bluck's store, sped onto the base Saturday and, they said, threw 
the package out. 
</P>
<P>
"We could not identify the box without moving it, so we placed a device next to 
it to neutralize it. Unfortunately in doing so we broke the china," said Capt. 
Joseph Phelan, commanding officer of the base. 
</P>
<P>
Bluck's spokesman Peter Darling denied that Ming had done anything wrong during 
the delivery. "He couldn't get past the sentry because the base was closed," he 
said.

STUDENTS REGRET BUT WON'T RETRACT ANTI-ISRAEL ARTICLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editors of the student newspaper at Orange County's Saddleback College, under 
fire for publishing an opinion piece that attacks Israel, vowed Wednesday not 
to bow to pressure for a retraction from administrators and local Jewish 
leaders who said the article was anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members of the Lariat, however, have agreed to print a two-paragraph 
"editor's note" in today's edition of the weekly that expresses "regret (over) 
any emotional distress (the) commentary and illustration have caused." 
</P>
<P>
Lariat Opinion Editor Lee McCormack said that aside from the editor's note, the 
staff was standing behind the piece on First Amendment grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not apologizing for anything," McCormack said. "We are just regretting 
the fact that we seemed to offend a lot of people. But I guess people can 
interpret (the editor's note) as an apology." 
</P>
<P>
Students, Jewish residents and top administrators, including the college 
president, have condemned the article and political cartoon by journalism 
student Michael S. Boren, charging that the piece was anti-Semitic and lacked 
understanding of Jewish history and culture. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this piece showed extremely poor taste and we were extremely offended 
by it," said Elizabeth Gale, Orange County director of the Anti-Defamation 
League of B'nai B'rith. "It's disturbing to see a student publish something 
that is full of inaccuracy." 
</P>
<P>
Richard J. Sneed, chancellor of the Saddleback Community College District, said 
the editor's note does not go far enough, and has hinted that district 
administrators may consider changes in the school's highly regarded journalism 
program. Sneed did not rule out the possibility that the Mission Viejo school's 
award-winning newspaper could lose its funding. 
</P>
<P>
The article, under the headline "Israel Enters Nuclear Arms Race," was harshly 
critical of Israel for stockpiling nuclear warheads. It also charged that 
Israel is a "fanatical government" that "will resort to any means to protect 
their religious claim on (Palestine)." 
</P>
<P>
The piece ended by stating that if Israelis "are indeed God's chosen people . . 
. it would seem that God might have made a better choice." 
</P>
<P>
The article was accompanied by a political cartoon that depicted a Hanukkah 
menorah tipped with singing nuclear warheads instead of candles. The smiling 
warheads, which are engraved with Stars of David, are singing: "We Wish You a 
Happy Holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
Since the article and cartoon were published in the Dec. 7 edition, 
administrators of the 23,000-student college said they have received more than 
100 calls from people who complained that the opinion piece was anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Boren, 26, said he was not prepared for the immense outcry over 
his work. 
</P>
<P>
Boren has received numerous awards for his illustrations, which he said are 
often controversial, "but not like this." 
</P>
<P>
While the writer-artist said he is "sorry if I offended anyone," he also said 
that he stands by his article and cartoon.

Gilbert "Sweet Sensation" Baptist of San Diego will face Tony Powell of Miami 
in the main event at the El Cortez Convention Center tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The first of seven fights, beginning at 7:30 p.m., is the last card of the year 
at the downtown hotel and could be the last ever because overcrowding in 
downtown courtrooms has caused the San Diego Judicial District to shift some of 
its workload to the convention center. 
</P>
<P>
The six-bout undercard features seven local boxers. Undefeated in three fights, 
Tom "Bomber" Brown of Chula Vista will face Mike Powell of San Diego in his 
professional debut. San Diego's Brad Powell (2-1) takes on Spring Valley's Gil 
Jacobs (1-1). 
</P>
<P>
Other fights include: Campo's Randy "Cowboy" Leaks (9-2) vs. Las Vegas' Donald 
Stephens (6-2); San Diego's Jorge Rivera (14-9) vs. Los Angeles' Vicente Lopez 
(7-1); Barrio Station's Rojelio Perez (3-2) vs. Mexicali's Jose Luis Vasquez 
(6-4); Los Angeles' Charles Kirk Young (2-2) vs. Mexico City's Roberto Gonzalez

Fortin (6-feet-5, 270 pounds) was an All-WAC second team selection this season. 
</P>
<P>
WATER POLO 
</P>
<P>
Two players and the coach were honored with postseason awards for UC San Diego, 
which enjoyed its finest season ever.

Jason Brown was named to the NCAA All-American second team, and Jason Vance was 
selected honorable mention. Brown, a junior who plays the two-meter position, 
led the Tritons with 81 goals and set a school record by drawing 85 opponent 
ejections. He was the only player chosen from a non-Division I school. 
</P>
<P>
Denny Harper was named coach of the year by the Western Water Polo Assn. for 
the second consecutive year. UCSD won its second consecutive WWPA title and 
earned an automatic berth to the NCAA Tournament where the Tritons finished

DOWNTOWN PRISON GETS FINAL OK; 
</P>
<P>
CORRECTIONS: STATE ACTION MEANS CONSTRUCTION COULD START IN SUMMER. BUT 
OPPONENTS VOW TO BLOCK THE FACILITY WITH A LAWSUIT.

<P>
State officials Wednesday gave final approval for construction of a prison on 
the edge of downtown Los Angeles, but opponents of the planned medium-security 
lockup immediately vowed to go to court to block the project. 
</P>
<P>
Corrections Director James Rowland said construction of the 1,450-bed prison 
could begin as early as summer. He promised that the $147-million prison would 
be a "good neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
"Residents will be able to take pride in this facility," Rowland said in a 
statement. "We look forward to a long and cooperative relationship." 
</P>
<P>
But there were no signs of cooperation Wednesday -- only more of the anger and 
distrust that have characterized the five-year fight over the project. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic Assemblywoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, who represents the southeast 
corner of downtown where the 20-acre prison site is located, said Rowland's 
action is "not the end" of the controversy. She said opponents would file suit 
in Superior Court within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
"The process has been unfair and illegal," Roybal-Allard said. "The state has 
totally ignored the impact that the prison is going to have on the community." 
</P>
<P>
Aurora Castillo, a spokeswoman for Mothers of East L.A., a grass-roots group 
that has fought the prison, said state approval of the facility was never in 
doubt because state officials "had no intention whatsoever of listening to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
"I think this whole thing is a farce," she said. "We have opposed the prison 
with respect and dignity and we will continue to do so. We do not want our 
community turned into a penal colony." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian proposed the prison in 1985, citing the fact that Los 
Angeles County accounts for about 40% of state prison inmates but has no 
prison. The facility is to be built on an industrial lot near Washington 
Boulevard and Santa Fe Avenue.

The fate of the Los Angeles prison is tied to a similar facility planned for 
Lancaster. The two projects were linked after Democratic lawmakers from Los 
Angeles complained that Republican constituents in rural parts of the county 
ought to accept an equal share of the prison burden. 
</P>
<P>
Under a legislative deal worked out, neither prison could be occupied until 
construction has begun on the other, said Mike Van Winkle, a spokesman for the 
Corrections Department. 
</P>
<P>
Van Winkle said plans for the Lancaster site are moving smoothly and should be 
completed soon. He also said the department is confident the Los Angeles prison 
plan could withstand a legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done everything by the book, everything that has been asked of us by 
the Legislature and the special legislation that was passed for this project," 
he said.

DANA SHOWS NEW IMAGE IN REDISTRICTING VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: HIS PLAN PROVIDES ELECTION SECURITY FOR HIMSELF AND THREE COLLEAGUES 
AT THE EXPENSE OF SUPERVISOR PETE SCHABARUM. THE MOVE STRENGTHENS DANA'S 
ALLIANCE WITH THE LIBERAL WING OF THE BOARD.

Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana has emerged as the power behind the 
scenes in the redistricting plan submitted to a federal court Wednesday as a 
possible settlement of a lawsuit seeking to increase Latino political clout. 
</P>
<P>
Dana, sometimes working alone and sometimes with the county's political 
consultant, drafted the plan that provides political security for himself and 
three colleagues at the expense of his one-time mentor, Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum. And, by casting the tie-breaking vote for the plan, Dana 
strengthened an alliance he has often forged with the board's liberal minority. 
</P>
<P>
"Soft-spoken, quiet Deane Dana turned out to be a pretty wily politician," said 
Robert Naylor, former state Republican Party chairman. 
</P>
<P>
The plan places Schabarum in a new, predominantly Latino district that may be 
difficult for him to hold. Dana benefits by exchanging Democratic areas such as 
Compton and Malibu, now in his district, for Republican strongholds in 
southeastern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Dana acknowledged that alternative plans could have hurt him politically and in 
seeking to develop his own plan, he said, "I wasn't going to shoot myself in 
the foot." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was the subject of a two-hour, closed-door meeting in court 
Wednesday between attorneys for the county and the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Judge David V. Kenyon told reporters that the parties "are still 
working on this matter. . . . They have agreed not to discuss this matter 
(publicly) because it could harm their work." Another meeting has been set for 
next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, the U.S. Justice Department and two civil rights groups have 
accused the supervisors of drawing their district lines in such a way as to 
preclude the election of a Latino to the five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
Two Latino politicians who have expressed interest in running for the county 
board offered mixed opinions Wednesday on whether the plan is likely to settle 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre said the county's proposal creates 
a good opportunity for a Latino candidate and should be accepted with minor 
revisions. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) said the map leaves out areas with high 
Latino voter turnout, such as Montebello and Pico Rivera. "I don't think the 
courts are going to accept that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Latino politicians generally agreed that the proposal was an important 
and positive step in the year-long legal dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Although the suit was closely followed in the Hall of Administration, Dana said 
Schabarum showed no interest in the remapping until a week ago. Dana said he 
and Schabarum were driving back together to the county Hall of Administration 
from a Coliseum Commission meeting when Schabarum began "asking me what's going 
on with this redistricting?" 
</P>
<P>
"I said, you know, we really are going to have to do something . . . to satisfy 
the judge, or he will probably come out against us," Dana said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Schabarum criticized the proposed settlement, saying that he and 
the Republican Party were sold out by Dana, a fellow Republican. Schabarum 
vowed to have the party pressure Dana into reconsidering his vote. The board is 
officially nonpartisan. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum, who was out of town Wednesday, could not be reached for comment. But 
his spokeswoman, Judy Hammond, said, "We want people to let him (Dana) know how 
upset they are that he put his own self-interest above the party's interest. 
This isn't just a Pete Schabarum-Deane Dana personality issue. 
</P>
<P>
"This may result in a liberal majority on the board." 
</P>
<P>
Dana's decision to vote with liberal Supervisors Ed Edelman and Kenneth Hahn in 
presenting the plan to the court was no surprise to political insiders. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Clayton, state civil rights representative for the League of United Latin 
American Citizens, added, "Dana has been battling Schabarum at the board for a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum helped elect Dana in 1980, and the two formed a conservative alliance 
on the board with Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Dana has taken more moderate positions, teaming up with liberal 
supervisors on issues such as increased funding for social programs. 
</P>
<P>
Dana insisted that he has not abandoned his Republican philosophy and often 
votes with Antonovich and Schabarum on a number of issues, such as private 
contracting of county services. 
</P>
<P>
The combative Schabarum has increasingly found himself isolated from his 
conservative colleagues -- to the point where Schabarum dispels the notion that 
a conservative majority exists any longer on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Some state Republican officials said they doubt that GOP pressure will have any 
effect on the supervisors' decision. 
</P>
<P>
Naylor said Dana is "viewed as an independent force" who did not rise to power 
through the party structure and many GOP officials might be reluctant to get 
involved in what is viewed as a "local sandbox fight."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUS SERVICE WILL OFFER ALTERNATIVE TO 
COMMUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new commuter bus service from the Antelope Valley to downtown Los Angeles is 
scheduled to begin in early January, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale and Lancaster city officials said they hope the $1.2-million, one-year 
pilot program approved by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on 
Tuesday will bolster efforts to encourage commuting alternatives. About 40,000 
of the Antelope Valley's more than 200,000 residents work in the Los Angeles 
Basin, officials said. Rush-hour traffic snarls along the mountain route of the 
Antelope Valley Freeway and four-hour round-trips have become commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
The initial bus service will offer two runs from Palmdale to the downtown Los 
Angeles business district, said Greg Kelley, transit manager for the county 
Public Works Department. It will cost $5 one way, with a monthly pass costing 
$145, he said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FEWER STUDENTS WALK OUT IN DRESS CODE PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new dress code at Peary Junior High School in Gardena triggered a walkout by 
nearly 180 students Tuesday, but the protest appeared to have lost some steam 
Wednesday when only 11 students walked out. 
</P>
<P>
Principal Alvin L. Hayes Sr. said he saw the students leaving the campus at 9 
a.m. Wednesday. He said they were joined off campus by four other students who 
had not reported to school. 
</P>
<P>
The new dress code, which went into effect Monday, was imposed by the school's 
leadership council, a 16-member group that includes faculty, parents, community 
members, a student and the principal. 
</P>
<P>
A previous dress code barred gang-oriented clothing in general, but the new 
rules specifically prohibit items such as hats, hair nets, bandannas, gloves, a 
single earring and gang colors. Students who walked out argued that the rules 
limit their personal freedom.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. FACES SUIT OVER HYPERION SEWAGE PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Segundo city officials said Wednesday that they will file a lawsuit against 
the city of Los Angeles alleging that the sprawling Hyperion Sewage Treatment 
Plant is a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
The city contends that the plant poses serious health and safety problems for 
residents living near it. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo officials said that it could take 30 to 60 days to prepare the 
lawsuit, which would come at a time when Los Angeles is under federal court 
order to update and expand the plant. The only thing that would stop the city 
from taking legal action would be if Los Angeles solves odor, noise and other 
problems caused by Hyperion that have plagued El Segundo residents, they said.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAPD CAPTAIN NAMED DOWNEY POLICE CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Police Department captain has been named the new chief of the 
Downey Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
D. Clayton Mayes, 47, a Downey resident, was approved for the job Tuesday night 
by the Downey City Council. Mayes, a former member of the Downey School Board, 
was selected over former Pomona Police Chief Richard M. Tefank, the runner-up 
of six finalists for the job. Mayes, who will be paid about $80,000 a year, 
replaces Chief Pete Stone, who retires Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Mayes joined the LAPD as an officer in 1964 and has been a captain since July, 
1979. He is the commanding officer of the department's burglary/auto theft 
division, which has about 60 detectives and officers, department spokesmen 
said. He has a master's degree in public administration.

SOME BELIEVE PLAN FOR ADDING 3RD AREA CODE IS A WRONG NUMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the upscale magazine Beverly Hills (213) was created six years ago, its 
editors never dreamed that the swanky city's area code would be changed to 310. 
</P>
<P>
But Pacific Bell and GTE California be damned, editor Susan L. Warner declared 
Wednesday. The change in area codes for Beverly Hills and dozens of other Los 
Angeles County communities announced a day earlier will have no impact on the 
name of her 50,000-circulation society and fashion weekly. 
</P>
<P>
"We are Beverly Hills (213), we are not Beverly Hills (310)," sniffed Warner. 
"(This is) a successful publication. We've gone beyond the reason for first 
choosing our name." 
</P>
<P>
Warner, however, seemed in a distinct minority Wednesday as businessmen and 
officials of communities directly impacted by the area code switch-over 
pondered the impact of the phone companies' decision. 
</P>
<P>
Bothered that they were given no input, officials in several cities that will 
now be bisected by two area codes said they are considering legal or 
legislative remedies. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a state of shock," said City Manager Claude Booker of Bell Gardens, a 
southeast Los Angeles County community where one third of the residents will 
have 213 as their area code and the rest will have 310. "We will have to 
evaluate it and decide if we want to fight them." 
</P>
<P>
In West Hollywood, which will be sliced in half at La Cienega Boulevard, Mayor 
Abbe Land said that unless Pacific Bell officials reconsider, "we will explore 
avenues including legal avenues." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, whose district also includes 
portions of the San Fernando Valley served by the 818 area code, said: "They 
should have discussed this with us in advance." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said that it made more sense to keep the Miracle Mile, Beverly 
Hills, Century City and Westwood together under one area code than Westwood and 
Long Beach, which will both be in the 310 area code. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to filing lawsuits against the phone companies, the cities say they 
have the option of seeking special state legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"A whole range of things could be considered," said Inglewood City Manager Paul 
Eckles, whose city will be split between 213 and 310 area codes. "Legal action 
is certainly one. Getting some kind of special legislation to restrict the 
phone companies to do this is another." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the state Public Utilities Commission, which regulates rates 
charged to phone customers, said the agency does not interfere with phone 
company decisions to split area codes. 
</P>
<P>
In the plan due to take effect in February, 1992, a U-shaped portion of Los 
Angeles County, stretching from Malibu south to Long Beach and east to 
Whittier, will be incorporated in the new 310 area code. Downtown Los Angeles 
and some surrounding communities, such as Hollywood and Montebello, will remain 
in the 213 area code. 
</P>
<P>
Phone company officials said the split is necessary because they are running 
out of phone numbers for Los Angeles due to the region's bustling economy and 
increasing reliance on such new technology as fax machines and cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
In all, eight communities will have customers in both area codes, phone company 
officials said. They added that there was no need to consult local officials 
because they were determined to make their decision based on technological 
factors rather than geopolitical guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Their primary concern, they said, was to split the 213 district into two 
regions of similar projected growth so that any further area code subdivision 
can be postponed as long as possible. 
</P>
<P>
By doing so, Los Angeles becomes the first major city in the nation to have 
three area codes. The 310 area code will also be the first that divides a major 
city along artificial boundaries rather than by geographic or political 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
When the 818 area code was introduced to Los Angeles in 1981, the phone company 
chose a north-south division that coincided neatly with the ridgeline of the 
Santa Monica Mountains. In San Francisco; Dallas; Newark, N.J.; Boston, and 
Chicago -- where area codes have been split up in the past few years -- the 
integrity of city boundaries were maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Bell media relations manager Kathleen Flynn said that the new Los 
Angeles division is different because Los Angeles itself is different. 
</P>
<P>
"Has any city grown and changed as much as Los Angeles?" she asked. "And we 
have so many surrounding communities that make up the global and nebulous term 
that is Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Countered Yaroslavsky: "What's the old story about Los Angeles being a series 
of suburbs looking for a city? I think this is a reflection of that 
characterization. 
</P>
<P>
"No question about it, it's almost as if it doesn't matter where you draw the 
line to the phone company."

'PRIEST OF PORN' IS ARRESTED; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: SUSPECT WANTED IN LOS ANGELES IS ARRESTED IN SPOKANE, WASH. POLICE SAY 
HE LED A RING THAT PRODUCED CHILD PORNOGRAPHY. 
</P>

<P>
A former Roman Catholic priest sought by Los Angeles police on child 
pornography charges has been arrested by sheriff's deputies in Spokane, Wash., 
authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
John Bauer, 53, who Los Angeles police said led a four-man ring that produced 
pornographic videos of boys in Hollywood and Mexico, was arrested late Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Bauer is being held without bail on federal charges that he 
fled California to avoid prosecution. He probably will have an extradition 
hearing next week. 
</P>
<P>
Spokane County sheriff's deputies stopped Bauer and a friend on an interstate 
highway on the outskirts of the city, said Sheriff's Detective Mark Henderson. 
A source had informed deputies that Bauer was in town for a day and was 
apparently headed to Seattle, Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer may have gone to Spokane -- where years ago he ran an adult bookstore -- 
to borrow money, police said. Bauer's companion, who deputies identified as "a 
long-time friend," was not arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said Bauer told authorities that he had been "bouncing around" 
several Western states and Mexico since he fled Los Angeles following a 
drug-related arrest in August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
That month, Los Angeles police served Bauer with a search warrant and 
confiscated marijuana plants and more than 100 videotapes from his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Police then arrested Bauer on marijuana cultivation charges and he was released 
on $1,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities later reviewed the tapes, which showed Bauer and three other men 
committing sex acts on boys, ages 8 to 14, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time police realized that the videos contained evidence that 
incriminated Bauer in a child pornography ring, the former priest had fled Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer is charged with production of child pornography, conspiracy to produce 
and distribute child pornography and conspiracy to commit child molestation. 
</P>
<P>
The three other men were charged on the basis of evidence contained in the 
tapes. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the three -- David Negrette, 26, of Huntington Beach, and Jerry 
Houchens, 49, of Santa Ana -- were arrested in March. Negrette is currently on 
trial on child molestation charges in Orange County. The others await trial. 
</P>
<P>
Police are still searching for the fourth member of the alleged pornography 
ring, Victor Feliciano, 29. 
</P>
<P>
Bauer -- referred to as the "Priest of Porn" in a 1984 interview published in 
Chic magazine -- was an altar boy in the fourth grade and later led a Montana 
parish as an ordained priest, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1963 and 1970, Catholic Church officials tried unsuccessfully to have 
Bauer removed from the priesthood. After opening a lucrative adult bookstore in 
Bozeman, Mont., he was finally dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he continued to wear his priestly garments and introduce himself 
as Father Bauer, police said. In calling attention to his businesses -- which 
eventually spread to Washington and included a sex shop called Miss Kitty -- he 
became "quite a media figure," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't shy of publicity," the detective added.

HAHN SAYS BRADLEY SHOULD HAVE NO ROLE IN RITTENBERG PERSONNEL CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing "unique and extraordinary circumstances," City Atty. James K. Hahn said 
Wednesday that Mayor Tom Bradley should be disqualified from deciding whether 
to discipline City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg, a central figure in the 
controversy over the mayor's personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley had requested a Personnel Department inquiry into Rittenberg's 
performance last July after a series of disclosures about possible 
irregularities involving city deposits placed in Far East National Bank, for 
which Bradley was a paid consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn said in a written opinion that the city's Board of Referred Powers -- a 
panel of five council members -- should hear the Rittenberg case, instead of 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of your own personal involvement in some of the events . . . members 
of the public may well question your objectivity," the opinion said. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn issued the opinion at the request of Bradley, who last week asked that he 
be disqualified from the Rittenberg case, because the mayor or his staff may be 
called as witnesses in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Hahn, Bradley said, "The plain fact is that, because of my 
relationship to parts of this matter, any action I might take concerning the 
report would be questioned." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said that any action he took "might be seen as too lenient or too harsh 
and as motivated by self-serving reasons." 
</P>
<P>
It was Rittenberg's decision last March 22 to invest $2 million in Far East, 
without competitive bidding, that thrust him into the middle of a controversy 
over Bradley's relationship with the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley had telephoned Rittenberg on the morning the money was deposited, but 
both men deny that the mayor attempted to influence the decision. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's office received the Personnel Department report on Rittenberg last 
week, but the envelope has remained sealed while Hahn's office reviewed the 
matter, according to Bill Chandler, Bradley's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, Bradley would preside over a personnel matter, 
recommending -- depending on the contents of a report -- either no action, 
disciplinary sanctions or firing. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach Rittenberg for comment Wednesday were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, a member of the Board of Referred Powers, said 
Wednesday that the situation is "unprecedented" and that the board will now 
have to design a procedure for dealing with personnel matters.

<P>
"It's going to be awkward," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
The board was set up to act in place of city officials or commissioners who 
have a conflict of interest on a specific issue. 
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the City Council's Finance Committee, Yaroslavsky has presided 
over a number of hearings on Rittenberg's investment policies and the handling 
of the Far East deposits. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never come to a conclusion about what I think should happen to 
Rittenberg," Yaroslavsky said. "I think we can be fair, and I think we have to 
be fair." 
</P>
<P>
The contents of the Personnel Department report have not been publicly 
disclosed and will remain private throughout any hearings by the Board of 
Referred Powers, Yaroslavsky said. It is not known whether the report 
recommends any disciplinary action, he added. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the crazy Civil Service rules of this city, it is possible to commit a 
wrongful act and not be punished for it," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
The other council members on the board are Richard Alatorre, Ruth Galanter, Hal 
Bernson and Joan Milke Flores.

TEACHERS BACK NON-MEMBERS' UNION FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY BANKS, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District have voted overwhelmingly 
to require non-union teachers, counselors, nurses and librarians to pay the 
union a service fee, amounting to about $350 a year, to work in the district. 
</P>
<P>
About 22,000 of the district's 35,000 credentialed employees -- union members 
and non-members -- cast secret ballots in the monthlong vote. The final vote 
was 14,362 to 7,009. Votes were counted Wednesday by the state Public 
Employment Relations Board, which will decide the amount of the fee and when it 
will begin. 
</P>
<P>
United Teachers-Los Angeles represents about 23,000 of the district's teachers, 
but the union bargains for salaries and benefits for all the district's 
credentialed employees, which includes counselors, librarians and nurses. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, UTLA has been required to represent both members and those who 
chose to be non-members equally, with members' dues paying for everything," 
said Catherine Carey, union spokeswoman. "We think the vote assessing a service 
fee to non-members is only fair." 
</P>
<P>
Union members pay dues amounting to 1.5% of a beginning teacher's salary -- 
about $400 a year. Non-members would pay about 90% of that, which has been 
deemed the cost of providing contract negotiations and other representational 
services, but not lobbying or recruitment activities. A recent state Supreme 
Court ruling barred teachers' unions from using the fees over teachers' 
objections for political activities. 
</P>
<P>
The "agency shop" fee proposal was approved 5 to 2 by the school board in 
September, on the grounds that it is not fair for non-union members to benefit 
from collective bargaining agreements without having to contribute dues to the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
The fees will add about $1.8 million to the union's annual $5-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only will we have more resources to assist members and non-members now, 
but we think this will unify the bargaining unit," Carey said. 
</P>
<P>
Relations between union and non-union teachers were acrimonious during last 
spring's nine-day strike, when many non-union teachers crossed picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing before the board on the issue of service fees in September, 
several teachers spoke out against the fees, saying they should not be forced 
to support a union they disagree with. 
</P>
<P>
But union members complained that those teachers were getting a "free ride" by 
reaping the benefits of the contract the union negotiated -- granting teachers 
a 24% raise over three years -- without having to contribute to the union.

Heroin addicts far outnumber all other drug users admitted to state-funded drug 
treatment programs in Orange County during each of the past six years, although 
the number has decreased slightly each year after reaching a peak in 1985. At 
the same time, however, the percentage of all admissions who are heroin users 
has declined steadily since 1983.

JIM MURRAY: BOOMING OR NOT, SHE'S EASILY THE BEST AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is not characteristic of me to offer advice to (quasi)rival publications, 
not even my alma mater, Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
But, it has come to my attention, the magazine is casting about for its annual 
sportsman of the year cover and candidates are coming from all over. 
</P>
<P>
I have one for them, the individual I would like to see on the cover of the 
last issue of the year. 
</P>
<P>
It's a West German tennis player who may be the best ever to play the game. 
Fair-haired, cat-like, No. 1 in the world. Hits the ball with the booming 
authority of the born slugger, has this long sweeping stride and is the 
most-feared competitor in the game today. Never throws a racket, curses an 
umpire, describes the host country as "the pits" or acts the spoiled brat. 
Never talks much at all. Just smiles. And wins. 
</P>
<P>
Boris Becker? Who said anything about Boom-Boom? 
</P>
<P>
No, my candidate for sportsman of the year is a fraulein, the other half of the 
umlaut entry in the world of pro tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Becker is good. But he's not one set better than anybody playing his game. 
</P>
<P>
Steffi Graf is. There are those who think she's a set better than anyone who 
ever played her game -- Helen Wills Moody, Mo Connolly, Martina Navratilova, 
Chris Evert, Billie Jean King, Margaret Court. She is better than any of them 
in the view of longtime tennis coach and scholar Vic Braden. "She hasn't even 
begun to scratch the surface of her talent," Braden insists. "She just stands 
at the baseline and beats your brains out. The only time she comes to the net 
is to get the check. As soon as she needs some other strokes and other parts of 
the game, she'll get them." 
</P>
<P>
She is only 20 years old. She has earned $5,251,345 on a tennis court. She won 
83 of 85 matches she played this year. Of the 16 tournaments she entered, she 
won 14 of them and was a finalist in the other two. She has won seven of the 
last eight Grand Slam events (French, U.S. and Australian opens plus Wimbledon) 
and was a finalist in the other. 
</P>
<P>
She looks more like a Rhine maiden than an athlete. You imagine the Lorelei 
looked like this. Or it's a face right out of Grimm's Fairy Tales. She was born 
in a gingerbread house. You want to ask her whatever happened to Hansel. 
</P>
<P>
She is as German as a glockenspiel. And fittingly, she plays this kind of 
Wagnerian game, full of crashing crescendoes, heroic passages, lyric 
transitions. She attacks. She doesn't have quite the tenacity of a Billie Jean 
or the stately elegance of a Helen Wills. She's a pouncer. She leaps on a 
mistake like a leopard on a waterbuck. 
</P>
<P>
If Orel Hershiser won 83 of every 85 games he pitched, there'd be no question 
who'd be Sportsman of the Year every year. If a golfer won 14 of every 16 
tournaments he entered, including all the majors or even three out of four, 
he'd be a statue in every clubhouse in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Age 20 is a little young to be a figurehead for an entire industry. At 20, 
you're supposed to be barely out of teeth braces and Michael Jackson records. 
Steffi Graf is a world figure and she doesn't even wear lipstick yet. 
</P>
<P>
Is it a drag? 
</P>
<P>
"It's all right if you like what you're doing -- and I like what I'm doing," 
insists Graf, in Los Angeles to play a Michelin challenge match with her No. 4 
pursuer, Zina Garrison. "I have good surroundings. I feel good about what I 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Does she find the responsibility a bit sticky -- the lack of privacy, the 
demands on her time? "Well, I've had 2 1/2 years to get used to it," she says. 
"I've been No. 1 for that time. And I just grew into (the role). I know what my 
responsibilities are, what's expected of me, what my obligations to tennis and 
the public are. 
</P>
<P>
"In Europe, I'm more instantly recognized, but I'm more left alone. They say, 
'Oh, it's Steffi!' But they don't bother you for autographs while you're 
eating. Here, they are not so considerate." 
</P>
<P>
How does West Germany react to having not one but two international sports 
heroes in Becker and Graf? Who's seeded No. 1 in their little tournament there? 
</P>
<P>
"We are equal in attention," Graf shrugs. "I don't think about it really. I am 
not in competition with Boris Becker. My focus is Martina or Gabriela 
(Sabatini)." 
</P>
<P>
Graf has been the best player in the world since the day at Wimbledon in the 
final in 1988 when she stopped Martina's win streak of 47 matches there -- 
three short of Helen Wills Moody's Wimbledon record. 
</P>

But she admits there is a double standard in tennis. Could she, she is asked, 
indulge in the luxury of orbiting a racket into the stands, scorching the ears 
of a chair umpire with a collection of epithets more suited to the cab of a 
truck than a center court? Graf smiles. "I don't think it would be so good," 
she admits. "For me or the game." 
</P>
<P>
Does she not feel like exploding at times? Graf nods. "I have a temper," she 
agrees. "I get angry when a call is wrong. But I control it, just as I control 
the rest of my game. Tennis requires concentration." So does anger.

For Steffi Graf, life has a net in it. She is either on a baseline or an

Illustrated, that she should be on their cover as sportsperson of the year. One 
thing is sure: Her record of success will outmeasure anyone else who may make 
it.

RACING BOARD SPURNS POSITIVE COCAINE TESTS;

HORSE RACING: PROCEDURES ARE ATTACKED BY ASSEMBLYMAN AFTER SECOND SET OF 
SPECIMENS IS THROWN OUT.

Fifty to sixty race horse urine specimens that contained traces of cocaine will 
be ignored because they do not provide the standard of proof required by the 
California Horse Racing Board, legislators were told during a joint hearing of 
the Assembly and Senate Governmental Operations committees here Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the CHRB, on advice of the state attorney general's office, 
dropped accusations against several prominent trainers whose horses had yielded 
similar positive tests. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Norman Hester, head of the board's official tester, Truesdail Laboratories, 
confirmed the long-rumored additional positive tests in response to a question 
from Assemblyman Richard Floyd (D-Bellflower). 
</P>
<P>
Hester added, however, that the data provided by tests did not conform to the 
new guidelines set up after accusations against Wayne Lukas, Laz Barrera and 
three other trainers were dropped last May. 
</P>
<P>
Said Dr. Dennis Meagher, the racing board's equine medical director: "There's 
no point in going through the same trauma again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time these probably would have gone on to the accusation stage as 
well. But there's no justification in going forward when we know they do not 
meet the (new) required standards of proof. 
</P>
<P>
"All you can really say about those tests was that they were suspect and 
exhaustively tested," Meagher added. 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour hearing focused on a critical look at the operation of the CHRB 
staff and its executive secretary, Leonard Foote. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd, who calls himself an advocate of the $2-bettor, painted a picture of 
disorganized staffing, questionable contract practices, inept handling of 
post-race urine samples and confused investigative priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a definite indication that management on the CHRB stinks," Floyd 
said. "I see a lack of care, a lack of responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Foote disagreed. "Naturally, I think some of the things he (Floyd) said were 
misinterpreted or incorrect. It would be inappropriate to respond now, however. 
Although I do hope to be able to do so in the proper setting." 
</P>
<P>
The criticisms aired by Floyd were either prompted by committee witnesses or 
made after the session. He saved his loudest salvos for what he saw as shoddy 
sealing and labeling of post-race urine samples. 
</P>
<P>
According to Susan Grantham, senior CHRB investigator and the board's custodial 
observer at Truesdail, her repeated memos to Foote's office regarding cracked 
seals and peeling labels were ignored until late this year when she was finally 
allowed to take bids on better quality materials. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, there's nothing worse than messing up potential 
evidence," Floyd said. "How can we have a deterrent drug-testing program when 
defense lawyers can come in laughing at the evidence?" 
</P>
<P>
Foote said that a special sealing tape was required to meet the specific needs 
of glass containers that are often handled in both frozen and unfrozen states. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't until recently that 3M Company actually invented a tape to our 
specifications," Foote said. "Unfortunately, when we received it, the tape was 
improperly labeled, causing a further delay." 
</P>
<P>
Backed by testimony from Ingrid Fermin, CHRB medication steward, Floyd 
questioned what he called a preoccupation among CHRB investigators with 
financial complaints and keeping bookmakers away from the track. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how they can do their jobs sitting in the offices doing paper 
work, or chasing down bookmakers outside the race track," Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
"They belong on the backstretch, maintaining a high profile. Deterrent does not 
just mean a testing lab. It means investigators out and about." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd pointed out that the racing board's contract for the electric carts that 
serve as track transportation for staff personnel and investigators was awarded 
to a firm owned by Albert Foote, Len Foote's brother. 
</P>
<P>
Len Foote said he had had nothing to do with the cart contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I have disqualified myself from the awarding of all such contracts," Foote 
said. "That is handled strictly by the business office of administrative 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
Floyd vowed that there would be some changes made in the CHRB staff. 
</P>
<P>
"What it looks like is that the members of the racing board have turned over a 
lot of power to Foote and his people," he said. "He's been there a long time, 
and he's become some kind of czar, to the point where we hear things like, 'Len 
Foote's board.' That's not the way things should be run."

Mark Carrier said Wednesday that he will stay at USC for his senior season of 
football, and while Junior Seau is undecided, he said he is also inclined to 
remain in school. 
</P>
<P>
Carrier, a consensus All-American strong safety, and Seau, an outside 
linebacker and the Pacific 10 defensive player of the year, have been 
considering making themselves available for the NFL draft in April. 
</P>
<P>
NFL observers say they would be first-round choices if they forsake their final 
year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Carrier will be a fifth-year senior next season, having redshirted as a 
freshman. Seau is currently a junior, having lost his freshman season of 
eligibility because of the Proposition 48 academic rule. 
</P>
<P>
USC will play Michigan in the Rose Bowl game on New Year's Day. MAL FLORENCE

Byron Scott and Michael Cooper, who said that they had engaged in Tuesday 
night's fight with Charlotte Hornet center Stuart Gray strictly to protect 
Laker teammate James Worthy, nonetheless were fined by the NBA office 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Scott was fined $2,000 and Cooper $1,000 for "adding to the escalation of the 
altercation," according to Rod Thorn, the NBA's vice president of operations. 
Gray was fined $5,000 and suspended for a game for fighting with no fewer than 
five Lakers. Worthy was fined $500 for pushing Gray. 
</P>
<P>
Laker players were told of the fines before Wednesday night's game against the 
Miami Heat. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to pay it," said Scott, who also was fined $500 after being the 
third player in a pushing incident between Magic Johnson and Phoenix's Kevin 
Johnson on Nov. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Said Cooper: "I guess it's justified. There's nothing we can do about it. (The 
league) has made a stand about fighting." 
</P>
<P>
Added Worthy: "It's justice." 
</P>
<P>
Gray, according to Thorn, was fined and suspended for "initiating an 
altercation with James Worthy, throwing a punch and brawling." He will sit out 
Charlotte's game tonight at Washington. SAM McMANIS

NEWSWIRE: BASEBALL RELEASES FEMALE UMPIRE POSTEMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 13 years of toiling in the minor leagues in an effort to become the first 
female umpire in the majors, Pam Postema was released by baseball officials, 
she said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Postema, 35, the third female umpire in professional baseball, became the first 
to be promoted to triple A, where she remained for eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the game, I liked umpiring and I really thought it should be my life 
-- that's why I stuck it out," Postema told the Associated Press in a telephone 
interview from Phoenix, where she works as a driver for United Parcel Service. 
"And I still think I can do the job as good as anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm bitter right now and I don't want to brag, but if I couldn't make it, I 
don't see how any woman can." 
</P>
<P>
Her departure leaves Theresa Cox, who made her debut last year in the Arizona 
Rookie League, as the game's only female umpire.

PARRISH'S 'NEW LOOK' SAME AS OLD: HE SIGNS 3-YEAR DEAL WITH ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After taking a new look at his options, Lance Parrish decided the view is best 
from right where he is. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish, granted "new look" free agency last month as an offshoot of baseball's 
second collusion case, signed a three-year contract with the Angels Wednesday 
worth $6.75 million. The 33-year-old catcher, who was the foundation of the 
pitching staff's outstanding performance last season, earned a base salary of 
$1 million and added $210,000 in bonuses this year. He hit .238 in 124 games 
with 17 home runs and 50 runs batted in, and his .993 fielding percentage was 
tops among catchers playing more than 95 games. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish will receive a $500,000 signing bonus and salaries of $1.75 million in 
1990, $2.25 million in '91 and $2.25 million in '92. He may have undermined his 
leverage by publicly saying he wanted to stay with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I hurt my own case, but I wasn't too concerned about that," said 
Parrish, who waived his right to free agency when the Angels acquired him from 
Philadelphia in October of 1988 but was awarded another chance by arbitrator 
George Nicolau. "I felt the Angels treated me very fairly. I never was 
concerned about cutting myself short. They realized I could talk to other 
clubs. Some clubs had shown interest in me early, but the Angels were very 
earnest in their decision to talk with me and get it done."

INNOVATION: U.S. SHOULD WELCOME THE BEST, BRIGHTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the young Albert Einstein appeared today as a Caltech grad student who 
wanted to make his career in America, he probably couldn't get a green card. 
</P>
<P>
Unless Albert had a guaranteed job or friendly relatives here, back he would go 
to Europe -- no ifs, ands or buts. But he's a genius?! Doesn't matter -- our 
country has an immigration policy that deliberately discriminates against 
people with brains and skill. 
</P>
<P>
Roughly 650,000 people a year are granted legal immigration status in this 
country. Less than 6% are admitted on the basis of expertise -- such as a 
Rupert Murdoch. Family connections or political oppression matter most. Our 
immigration system is so messed up that an aspiring immigrant's knowledge and 
entrepreneurial drive are virtually irrelevant to the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
"We're surprisingly unaccommodating to business-related immigration," says 
Arthur C. Helton, who teaches immigration law at New York University. 
</P>
<P>
That's crazy. From its earliest days, this country's leadership in technical 
innovation has depended on a flow of brilliant immigrants looking for a chance 
they could never get at home. We entered the Industrial Revolution in 1789 when 
Samuel Slater escaped to Rhode Island from England with plans for textile mills 
tucked securely in his head. Without emigres from Hitler's Europe, America 
wouldn't have built the atomic bomb and established primacy in the physical 
sciences. And (ironically) without the Werner von Brauns, we would have no 
space program or man on the moon. Computer technology? Our lead can be traced 
to immigrants such as An Wang and Intel's Andrew Grove. Asian immigrant 
entrepreneurs, often relying on school or family ties to keep them in this 
country, are now reshaping California's high-tech industries. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake: Innovation comes from immigration. And yet, since legislation 
in 1965, our policy has ignored that heritage. "Our immigration policy 
certainly isn't dedicated to the entrepreneur," says Peter H. Loewy of 
Fragomen, Del Rey &amp; Bernsen, a Los Angeles-based law firm handling 
corporate immigration. For the past 20 years, we've paid far more time, money 
and attention to illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
It's time to change focus. If you believe that our global competitiveness 
depends on our "human capital," then we've got to consider an immigration 
policy that's designed to attract the world's brightest. 
</P>
<P>
Elitist? You bet. The point is not to turn one's back on the huddled masses 
yearning to breathe free but to also be pro-active and extend a welcome to 
immigrants with intellectual capital and ambition. Why shouldn't we offer the 
best of both worlds -- a refuge for the world's oppressed and an opportunity 
for the world's gifted? 
</P>
<P>
Recent events give real urgency to that question. Margaret Thatcher's Britain 
has turned its back on Hong Kong, a nation filled with entrepreneurs and 
hard-working professionals who fear what China has in store. The best-selling 
new magazine there is called Emigrant. Why should Vancouver get the creme de la 
creme of Hong Kong's business class? Canada makes immigration far easier than 
we do. This country needs the sort of dynamism that these immigrants could 
provide. Let's welcome them. 
</P>
<P>
Look at Eastern Europe. There are hundreds of thousands of scientists and 
engineers, both superbly educated and technically proficient, in Hungary, East 
Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia. Yes, dramatic market reforms are under way. 
But does anyone honestly believe that a Hungarian engineer with a great idea 
will get venture capital? Or that West Germany will cheerfully absorb all the 
engineers that East Germany has to offer? Emigration is limited but possible. 
Why shouldn't these highly trained people look to the United States to enjoy 
the risks and benefits of a market economy? What's more, why shouldn't we 
encourage this as a matter of policy? 
</P>
<P>
It's not as though West Germany and Japan -- our leading economic rivals -- 
want to compete with us for all this talent and brains. They're historically 
immigrant-averse. Great. Let's go with our strength. We know how to cope with 
immigration; we know how to provide a chance to those from other lands. Let's 
use immigration policy as a tool to enhance our competitiveness in cutting-edge 
technologies and not primarily as a source of cheap labor. Let's send a message 
to the world that we value the skilled, educated and hard-working mind -- and 
that we're prepared to reward it with the gift of opportunity and citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't put any barriers in place for those who can meaningfully 
contribute to our economy," says National Science Foundation Director Erich 
Bloch, a German immigrant. "We only hurt ourselves when we do that." 
</P>
<P>
The Simpson-Kennedy Immigration Act of 1989 -- which overwhelmingly passed the 
Senate this summer -- is a small but important step in recognizing the 
strategic economic importance of immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
The bill -- which goes to the House next year -- marks the first shift away 
from the purely family-centered immigration policy of the past 25 years by 
adding 104,000 new slots for immigrants who can bring special skills to this 
country. Half those slots go to companies hiring professionally trained foreign 
nationals. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also sets up a point system for evaluating "independent immigrants," 
and, as in Canada, confers legal status on foreign entrepreneurs who set up 
businesses that employ at least 10 Americans. Capitol insiders say the bill has 
a shot. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration, mum thus far, would be smart to make Simpson-Kennedy 
its own and champion merit-based immigration. It's a natural for the "Education 
President." Go an extra step: Give people with master's degrees and Ph.Ds in 
science and engineering automatic green cards. Let's be a magnet for technical 
talent in Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
A possible brain drain? We'll see. Our universities educate some of the finest 
minds in the world. What's wrong with keeping a few more of them here after 
they graduate? Other countries will recognize that their emigres will want to 
maintain ties and trade with their homelands. 
</P>

MANUFACTURING: A BACKLOG IN COMMERCIAL AIRLINE ORDERS MAY HELP OFFSET DECLINES 
IN DEFENSE WORK. BUT PAYROLLS AND PROFITS ARE EXPECTED TO SHRINK.

The aerospace industry will lose an estimated 27,000 jobs nationally and suffer 
a 13% decline in profits in 1990 but will post record sales on the strength of 
commercial aircraft production, according to a report by the Aerospace 
Industries Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The report indicates for the first time the magnitude by which commercial work 
will help cushion anticipated declines in defense work at least in the near 
term. The trade association projected that sales of commercial transport 
aircraft will jump 68% to $23.5 billion in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for major reductions in defense orders, stemming from easing tensions 
in Europe, have rocked the industry in recent weeks. Officials are still 
attempting to understand which companies will be affected and how steeply the 
defense budget will drop. 
</P>
<P>
So far, analysts agree that no catastrophic blow to the industry is in sight 
for two or three years, but a painful consolidation will take place during the 
1990s to eliminate excess capacity. The extent of the downsizing will depend on 
decisions over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the industry is enjoying a historic boom in commercial work. 
The backlog of firm orders for airliners, not including options and other 
conditional agreements, reached $82 billion in 1989 -- an amount equal to an 
entire year of Pentagon procurement. Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, the two U.S. 
producers, have committed all of their production capacity through the early 
1990s to fill existing orders and have some orders booked past the turn of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Don Fuqua, president of the Washington-based trade group, said in an interview 
that the strong commercial outlook should help the industry absorb declining 
military orders at least for the next several years. But he was cautious about 
the longer-term outlook, predicting that defense spending would decline 
throughout the 1990s, not just in the first half as many industry optimists are 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not minimize the impact on our industry of the defense spending cuts we 
know are coming," he said in a speech Wednesday. "We are braced for heavy 
weather, particularly among those . . . companies most deeply committed to 
defense work." 
</P>
<P>
He added that the group expects "a moderate decline in real, inflation-adjusted 
sales volume." 
</P>
<P>
Total aerospace industry sales are expect to increase 5.6% during the year to a 
record $120.6 billion, and an even larger 14% gain is projected for 1990, the 
report said. Gains in commercial aircraft and a smaller increase in spacecraft 
production are expected to fully offset declines in missiles and military 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Aerospace industry employment is now 1.32 million Americans, virtually 
unchanged from last year. The civilian aircraft industry, which includes 
subcontractors, has added 35,000 jobs during the year and the military aircraft 
industry lost 14,000 jobs. Similarly, missile contractors were down 12,000 jobs 
and a category of leftover products was down 11,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
By occupation, the ranks of production workers grew by 8,000 jobs while 
scientists and engineers were net losers of 6,000 jobs in 1989. Next year, both 
groups will shrink. 
</P>
<P>
It may seem contradictory that sales will continue to increase and employment 
decrease. The reason is that the work force at commercial companies have 
already been built up, but increases in deliveries of aircraft have not yet 
occurred. For example, McDonnell Douglas plans to boost deliveries and sales of 
its MD-80 series of aircraft by one-third over the next several years with its 
existing work forces. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing has plans to increase the production rates of every one of its 
commercial aircraft lines. Its sales also were depressed this year by a lengthy 
strike at its Seattle plants that curtailed deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
Fuqua cited recent surveys that show a potential need for 8,500 new airliners 
over the next 15 years, an astronomical number that would boost production far 
higher than levels in the 1980s. The projection is based on a doubling of world 
aircraft traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The association, which has long complained that the Pentagon has provided for 
inadequate profits in weapons contracts, noted that the aerospace industry 
posted profit margins on sales of just 3.7% in 1989, "lower than similar ratios 
for all U.S. manufacturing industries."

U.S. POSTS BEST TRADE FIGURES IN NEARLY 6 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
TRADE: THE SHRINKING DEFICIT IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE DOLLAR'S RISING VALUE. BUT 
THE RED INK MAY STAY AT A HIGH LEVEL THROUGH THE '90S.

The United States recorded its best trade performance in almost six years from 
July through September as the deficit in the broadest measure of trade shrank 
29% to $22.69 billion, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the current account deficit narrowed by $9.4 
billion from a second-quarter imbalance of $32.08 billion, reflecting a big 
jump in the overseas earnings of U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
But economists discounted the huge swing, saying it did nothing to change their 
view that America's trade deficit will remain stuck at a high level through 
most of the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is the most 
important trade statistic because it measures not only trade in merchandise but 
also trade in services, the category that includes investment earnings between 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
For the third quarter, the services category registered a surplus of $8.72 
billion after posting a $1.66-billion deficit from April through June, the 
first services deficit in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
But the services swing from deficit to surplus was attributed almost totally to 
changes in the value of the dollar. In the third quarter, the dollar was 
declining, meaning that the profits U.S. companies earn in foreign currencies 
were worth more when they were translated into dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, a rising dollar had eaten into the profits Americans 
companies were earning in foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
The big swing in services helped offset a small increase in the merchandise 
trade deficit, which climbed 0.7% to $27.75 billion in the third quarter, and a 
rise in foreign aid and pension payments, the other category of the current 
account, which climbed to $3.66 billion, an increase of 27%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts forecast that the merchandise trade deficit will remain at stubbornly 
high levels in coming years and predicted that the services account will dip 
permanently into deficit sometime early in the 1990s, reflecting the fact that 
the United States is now the world's largest debtor nation. 
</P>
<P>
As residents of a debtor nation, Americans hold less in overseas assets than 
foreigners hold in U.S. assets. America's net debtor position stood at $532.5 
billion at the end of last year and is expected to worsen by an additional $100 
billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
That means that more and more U.S. wealth must be transferred into foreign 
hands in the form of interest payments and profits earned by foreign companies 
doing business in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The net debtor number is clearly moving in the wrong direction," said David 
Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill. "We are still borrowing money from 
overseas, and that means that our interest payments to foreigners will be going 
up." 
</P>
<P>
At the start of this decade, the United States was running surpluses in its 
current account because earnings from American investments abroad were enough 
to offset perennial deficits in merchandise trade. 
</P>
<P>
But as Americans transferred billions of dollars into foreign hands to pay for 
merchandise imports, the investment cushion shrank rapidly and disappeared 
altogether in 1985.

New FHA Cap May Aid Many Californians: The number of California home purchasers 
who could be eligible for FHA financing could increase by as much as 57% when 
the FHA limit is increased to $124,875 from $101,250 in selected counties early 
next year, according to La Jolla-based Dataquick Information Systems. 
Statewide, a total of 127,670 homes were bought with mortgages of $101,250 or 
less from January through October. A total of 200,022, or 56.7% more, were 
bought with mortgages of $124,875 or less.

AT&amp;T Wants to Use Soviet Satellite: American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. 
proposed increasing telecommunications circuits between the United States and 
the Soviet Union by using the Soviet Intersputnik satellite system. Telephone 
traffic between the two countries rose more than 140% in the past two years in 
part because of improvements in the telecommunications network, the New 
York-based company said. But demand still far exceeds existing capacity, it 
added. AT&amp;T said its proposal, which would require approval by the Federal 
Communications Commission, could triple telecommunications capacity between the 
two nations.

Former NTT Chairman Pleads Not Guilty: The former chairman of Nippon Telegraph 
&amp; Telephone pleaded not guilty to taking bribes in the Recruit 
shares-for-favors scandal, one of the biggest to rock Japan. "I myself have 
never done any favors for Recruit," the local media quoted Hisashi Shinto as 
saying. Tokyo prosecutors charged Shinto with receiving stock in return for 
favors while he headed NTT, the world's largest company in terms of the value 
of its outstanding shares. Shinto admitted that he received unlisted shares 
from the Recruit Co., but he told the court he did not see the stock as a 
bribe.

GTE Agrees to Cash Settlement: GTE Corp. has accepted $4.5 million from Home 
Shopping Network as a cash settlement that ended a $100-million damage award 
against the television retailer. The two sides announced in November they had 
reached an undisclosed settlement, but the dollar amount became public through 
filings to the Florida Public Service Commission. GTE has said its legal costs 
exceeded the settlement. The PSC has to determine whether those costs should be

Shareholders Group Sues First Interstate: A class-action suit has been filed 
against First Interstate Bancorp, alleging that the bank holding company misled 
shareholders about the faltering financial conditions of two of its banks. The 
suit specifically charges that bank executives misled "thousands of persons who 
purchased shares in First Interstate Bank" between Jan. 18, when the company 
reported 1988 fourth-quarter earnings of $144 million, and Dec. 7, when the 
company said it would add $400 million to its loan reserves, mostly for 
problems at its Texas bank.

GOLD PRICES FALL AS SOVIETS SNUB RUBLE REFORMS 
</P>

<P>
Gold futures prices fell sharply Wednesday on New York's Commodity Exchange as 
the Soviet Union rejected reforms that many investors had hoped would lead to a 
gold-backed Soviet currency. 
</P>
<P>
Futures prices of silver and platinum also plunged, frustrating speculators in 
the increasingly volatile precious metals markets. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures fell $9.80 to $10.80, with the contract for delivery in December 
settling $9.80 lower at $408.10 an ounce; silver finished 12.8 to 13.8 cents 
lower on the Comex, with December at $5.544 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures sank $13.70 to $14.10, 
with the January contract settling at $504.70 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
From mid-October through late November, gold soared from near $360 an ounce to 
almost $420, partly on ideas that the economic changes sweeping Eastern Europe 
would include a move by the Soviet Union to back its currency, the ruble, with 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
Such a move would greatly increase the ruble's value on the world market, where 
it is now almost useless, facilitating trade with other countries. 
</P>
<P>
A gold-backed ruble apparently was not discussed by the Soviet Parliament 
Wednesday, but they rejected other radical economic reforms, disappointing gold 
traders who had hoped for some strong indication of change, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst James Steel of Refco Inc. in New York said the gold selloff also 
appeared linked to reports that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev had threatened 
to resign. The report "has shaken confidence in people who bought gold" on 
speculation of Soviet reform, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $411.25 an ounce from $417.50 
Tuesday. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold slipped to $411.00 an ounce from $416.75. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.08 to close at a bid $414.73 an ounce.

Stock prices posted modest gains Wednesday, extending Tuesday's sharp rally, 
but closed off their session peaks as profit takers braked the advance. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, up more than 16 points at mid-session, 
closed with a 8.96 gain at 2,761.09. On Tuesday it climbed 23.89 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of New 
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 791 up, 734 down and 496 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders drew some encouragement from the Commerce Department 
report that retail sales rose 0.8% in November, the biggest increase in four 
months, reflecting the start of the holiday gift-giving season. Economists had 
expected a 0.2% rise. 
</P>
<P>
That eased a few worries on Wall Street that slackening consumer spending might 
be increasing the chances of a recession in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
But open-market interest rates rose following the news, and investors still 
seemed to be cautious about the outlook for the economy in 1990 and the 
prospect that corporate profits might continue to lag. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers also noted that the market bogged down after the Dow Jones industrial 
index moved within striking distance of the record closing high of 2,791.41 it 
reached on Oct. 9, before it took a 190-point drop four days later. 
</P>
<P>
Energy stocks were mixed in active trading, running into some resistance after 
their recent rally inspired by cold weather in many parts of the United States 
and forecasts of higher oil prices in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Among the volume leaders, Baker Hughes rose 1/8 to 26 7/8, Exxon dropped 1/2 to 
50 3/4, Amoco lost 3/4 to 54 7/8 and Texaco was down 7/8 at 56 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
In the blue chip industrial sector, Philip Morris rose 1/4 to 43, American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph gained 1 1/2 to 46 5/8, Coca-Cola added 3/4 to 80 1/4 
and Du Pont rose 1 to 124 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
But leading computer and technology issues were weak, apparently depressed by 
year-end tax selling. International Business Machines dropped 1 1/8 to 95 7/8 
and Digital Equipment was down 2 3/8 at 82 5/8, trading at its lowest levels in 
more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
UAL fell 8 to 168 3/4 as hopes diminished for emergence of a new deal to 
replace the buyout plan by an employee-management group that was dropped this 
fall after it ran into financing problems. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume rose to 184.66 million shares, up from 176.82 million on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, stock prices climbed to new closing highs, piercing the 38,000 mark 
on the Nikkei index, in moderate trading buoyed by foreign buying buying on the 
index. The 225-share Nikkei average soared 258.89 points to a record 38,062.42. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks also closed higher in moderate trading on London's Stock Exchange, as 
the market took its cue from a buoyant Wall Street. At the close, the Financial 
Times 100-share index was up 22.7 points, or 1%, at 2,386.2.

Bond Prices Are Mostly Higher 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were mostly higher after traders dismissed the large jump in 
November retail sales in favor of revised figures for the previous month, which 
pointed to an economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department's bellwether 30-year bond rose 3/32 point, around $1 
per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which declines when the price rises, fell to 
7.88% from 7.89% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The retail sales report initially sent bond prices lower as traders feared a 
resumption of stronger economic activity would diminish chances the Federal 
Reserve would lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices tend to rise in periods of economic softness because investors tend 
to turn to long-term, fixed-income investments such as bonds. The Fed also 
typically lowers interest rates to stimulate the economy, which also pushes 
prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
Prices rose Wednesday after traders focused on the Commerce Department's 
revised downward revision for October retail sales. The department said sales 
plummeted 1.3% in October, instead of the 1% originally reported. 
</P>
<P>
"It implies that there may be similar downward revisions to November, and 
therefore that the consumer is really weakening and the economy is really 
weakening," said analyst Kathleen Camilli at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was at 
8.563%, up from 8.438% late Tuesday.

The dollar finished mixed against other major currencies in choppy, hectic 
dealings after rebounding overseas. 
</P>
<P>
In currency trading, Zlatko Glamuzina, chief currency dealer at the New York 
office of Banco di Sicilia, likened Wednesday's trading to "a tug of war 
between the bulls and the bears." 
</P>
<P>
"The bulls would like to see the dollar go up and they say it has reached its 
bottom, but the bears are trying to pull it lower and seem to be winning the 
battle overall," Glamuzina said. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar got a boost from rumors that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
had resigned, although they were swiftly denied by the Soviet Embassy in 
Washington, currency dealers said. Also supporting the dollar were reports of 
intervention by some central banks to push down the value of the surging West 
Germany mark, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Putting a damper on the dollar, however, was speculation that the Federal 
Reserve was easing interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
fell 0.77 Japanese yen to close at 143.70 yen. It traded at 144.13 yen in 
London, and at 144.05 yen in New York, up from 144.00 yen late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was stronger against the British pound. Sterling bought $1.5955 in 
London, down from $1.6027 Tuesday, and $1.6000 in New York, down from $1.6085 
late Tuesday.

Heating Oil Gains for 11th Session 
</P>
<P>
Heating oil for near-term delivery rose for the 11th straight day, while 
livestock and meat futures advanced and grains and soybeans were mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
January heating oil futures surged on the New York Mercantile Exchange 
following the American Petroleum Institute's report late Tuesday of an 
unexpectedly large reduction in U.S. stocks of petroleum distillates last week. 
Extremely cold weather in Europe and the United States have kept demand for 
heating oil strong. 
</P>
<P>
Other energy futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent lower to 12 cents higher, with 
January at $20.77 a barrel; heating oil was 0.60 cent lower to 0.66 cent 
higher, with January up 0.66 cent at 67.96 cents a gallon, and unleaded 
gasoline was 0.10 to 0.20 cent lower, with January at 51.93 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Livestock and meat futures ended mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange with 
most of the strength centered in the pork belly pit, where prices rose sharply 
in a technically inspired rebound from recent steep losses.

CHRISTMAS BONUSES ARE BEING REPLACED BY INCENTIVE PLANS

Performance-based incentives increasingly are taking the place of year-end 
bonuses when employers decide who's been naughty or nice at holiday time. 
</P>
<P>
Although bosses who substitute incentive programs for traditional holiday 
bonuses risk being called Scrooges, the trend actually reflects the Santa Claus 
principle of rewarding "good," meaning productive, behavior, says consultant 
Paul Muller. 
</P>
<P>
"Bonuses, like salary, are no longer being treated as an entitlement," said 
Muller, director of Midwest compensation consulting for Ernst &amp; Young, a 
New York-based consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect, management now is saying, 'To the extent that you help us be 
successful, we'll help you be successful,' " Muller said Wednesday in a 
telephone interview from his Chicago office. 
</P>
<P>
The move away from holiday bonuses coincides with a trend toward fewer employee 
and retiree benefits -- especially in the health insurance area -- and lower 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
But Muller said the elimination of year-end bonuses is motivated more by 
management's desire to increase worker productivity than by cost cutting. 
</P>
<P>
While U.S. employers are becoming less generous with bonuses, their Japanese 
counterparts are growing more so. Japanese companies ordinarily pay bonuses 
twice a year, in summer and before the new year. 
</P>
<P>
Employees at 291 Japanese companies got winter bonuses this month averaging 
$4,870, up 7.3% from last year and the biggest increase in nine years, the 
Japanese Federation of Employers Assn. said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
An association official in Tokyo attributed the increase to business prosperity 
in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Compensation experts said traditional year-end bonuses in the United States 
typically represent 5% to 6% of annual pay for hourly workers and 10% to 15% 
for middle managers and executives. 
</P>
<P>
Muller had no statistics to support his contention that year-end bonuses are 
disappearing. But other experts said a trend toward incentive-based 
compensation was apparent. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a great deal of increase in the use of variable pay . . . tied to 
some performance measures," said Frank Belmonte, a compensation consultant with 
Hewitt Associates in Lincolnshire, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Kurisu of Strategic Compensation Associates in Los Angeles said Christmas 
bonuses are "kind of an anachronism" and are rarely found in large 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
But at companies where year-end bonuses have been traditional, Belmonte said, 
workers often expect them -- and management may feel obliged to hand them out 
-- even if the company has not had a particularly good year. 
</P>
<P>
"When you consider eliminating it, it's not an easy thing to do," he said. 
"It's a very emotional issue." 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, employers planning to replace the annual giveaway with an 
incentive-based program should give employees plenty of advance notice and 
spell out clearly the performance goals they will have to meet to qualify for 
incentive pay. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't eliminate it and say nothing," Belmonte said. "Eliminate it and do a lot 
of communication and explanation."

JOB-HUNGRY MUSCOVITES TURN TO MCDONALD'S

<P>
McDonald's Corp. said Wednesday that more than 25,000 Muscovites have responded 
to a single help-wanted ad in a newspaper seeking to fill 630 crew positions at 
the chain's first restaurant in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Applications are continuing to filter in, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The McDonald's restaurant on Pushkin Square is scheduled to open Jan. 31. It 
will be the fast-food giant's largest operation, seating 700 people indoors and 
200 more outside and is expected to serve more than 15,000 customers a day. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow-McDonald's, the joint venture between McDonald's Restaurants of Canada 
Ltd., a unit of Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's Corp., and the Foodservice 
Administration of the Moscow City Council, plans to eventually open 20 
restaurants in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said that so far 550 crew members have been hired for the Moscow 
operation. Staff will begin training next month and will earn $2.25 (1.5 
rubles) an hour, to be increased after three months, based on productivity. 
</P>
<P>
The company said that in recent weeks, it conducted more than 3,100 interviews, 
seven days a week, 10 hours a day at McDonald's Moscow office. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's said the applicants have varied backgrounds, ranging from housewives 
re-entering the work force or seeking their first jobs to students from Moscow 
University. About 20% said they know two languages. 
</P>
<P>
As of Sept. 30, McDonald's had 10,873 restaurants worldwide, including 2,763 
outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"McDonald's has spent a lot of time and money on developing an international 
presence, which now represents about 30% of its business," said analyst Richard 
Pyle at Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood. "The Moscow venture should help them bear 
some fruit from the investment." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that considering an average sale at McDonald's is about $2.50 to 
$3, the Moscow outlet may generate $13.7 million annually. The typical 
McDonald's unit brings in about $1.6 million in yearly revenue, they said.

A QUIET BEACH

<TEXT>
<P>
The sea laps endlessly onto the rock-bound beaches of Kobe, Japan, where Nobuko 
Nabeshima was born -- and lived until she was 20. 
</P>
<P>
"The water had a strong power; it soothed me as I grew up and I walked close to 
it all the time," Nabeshima says. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, 10 years after she left, Nabeshima thinks of those rocky, 
seaweed-filled beaches whenever she longs for home. 
</P>
<P>
Especially at New Year's, which she says is "a very big family-get-together day 
in Japan, just like Thanksgiving and Christmas in America." 
</P>
<P>
When she moved to West Los Angeles, just minutes from the shore, Nabeshima said 
she realized the beaches weren't at all like home. "At Santa Monica or Venice, 
the beaches are just sand. It doesn't even smell like the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
Then she discovered Zuma, where "there are rocks and seaweed and an ocean 
smell. And the configuration is more like home." 
</P>
<P>
Nabeshima, a linguistics student and part-time intern at a sound studio, says 
she has "very many good friends in Los Angeles," and always gets more holiday 
invitations than she can handle. "But somehow, I would rather be alone at Zuma 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I like that it's the Pacific Ocean. So at the end of it is Japan. I sometimes 
think I can almost see my homeland on a clear day. And just to think that this 
water may have touched my beach at home, that it goes back and forth to my 
land" makes her feel less homesick and more "in touch" with home. 
</P>
<P>
Nabeshima says, "When I feel the need, I usually go (to Zuma) at early morning 
or twilight. And I just sit. I bring a pot of hot coffee and my radio so I can 
listen to my favorite baroque music." 
</P>
<P>
At New Year's, especially, she gets up early in the morning and "it's just me 
and my car all alone on the Pacific Coast Highway. There's no traffic at that 
hour on New Year's Day. In Japan right now, it's the snowy season. But here it 
is the most beautiful time of year." 
</P>
<P>
Late afternoon at Zuma, she says, offers "the most beautiful sunsets you will 
ever see. The sun goes down right over the ocean. A lot of people in Los 
Angeles don't even notice; they say Los Angeles has no seasons. But they're 
wrong. You can see the change of season by the sunset. In summer, it goes down 
over a totally different place." 
</P>
<P>
Nabeshima says she "really appreciates" the beauty of Zuma. "When you're very 
upset, it's fabulous medicine. When you're homesick, it energizes you and makes 
you feel whole. That repetition, the come-and-go of the tides, gives you power, 
because that is basically our lives. A day comes and it goes. It is not a 
boring thing at all. Uniqueness can be found in common things." 
</P>
<P>
And a trip to Kobe can be found on the Zuma strand. BETTIJANE LEVINE

COPING: HOLIDAYS MEAN DEPRESSION FOR MILLIONS. A DATING SERVICE BOOKLET OFFERS 
COMMON-SENSE IDEAS FOR DEALING WITH IT.

<P>
The Christmas season that many spend 11 months anticipating each year can be a 
dreadfully slow, painful time for others who find themselves alone. 
</P>
<P>
The time between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day can be especially hard for 
some of the 72 million American adults who are single, widowed or divorced. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanksgiving marks the official beginning of the holiday season, and 
unfortunately, it marks the unofficial beginning of the holiday blues for 
millions of people," says Jeffrey Ullman, founder and president of Great 
Expectations, a Los-Angeles-based national video dating service. 
</P>
<P>
Ullman's company has put together a booklet offering 40 suggestions on how to 
overcome seasonal depression -- one tip for each day from Thanksgiving Day 
through New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestions in "A Singles Guide: 40 Days/40 Ways to Beat the Holiday Blues" 
are not outlandish. The most unusual suggestion is learning how to use 
chopsticks (Day 11) and the most daring could be making a list of personal 
accomplishments in the last year (Day 38). 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the ideas are based on common sense, the kind that eludes 
people when they dwell on their problems. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the suggestions are comments from experts who offer their theories 
on the causes of holiday blues and suggestions on how to keep from being 
trapped in a slump during what should be a happy time of year. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Warren Farrell, the author of "Why Men Are the Way They Are," 
writes that holiday depression may be triggered by stimuli such as Christmas 
songs that make people think of traditions that can no longer be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
"Holiday blues haunt us because the ritual etches itself on our unconscious 
mind," he says. "When something is left out like a cherished family member, it 
feels like looking at a puzzle with a piece missing. 
</P>
<P>
"The piece that is missing haunts us to such a degree it often prevents us from 
enjoying the puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
Farrell suggests starting at least one new ritual that fits current and most 
likely future circumstances. He says simpler traditions, like getting friends 
and children together to pull taffy or make tamales, are easier to repeat year 
after year. 
</P>
<P>
Farrell and Peter McWilliams, also quoted in the booklet, suggest one of the 
best ways to cope with the holiday season is to realistically expect some 
amount of depression. 
</P>
<P>
"Treat the holidays like news of a new flu: Build up your immune system, plan a 
counteroffensive," Farrell says. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara De Angelis, a therapist and the executive director of the Los Angeles 
Personal Growth Center, says overindulging may be a physiological cause of 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
"The more alcohol, sugar and heavy food you ingest, the more strain you produce 
on your body and the higher your chances of feeling depressed and fatigued and 
getting a bad case of the holiday blues," De Angelis says. 
</P>
<P>
"Enjoy with moderation, but remember that a treat isn't a treat if you feel ill 
or dull after eating it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
While the booklet offers many ideas that include family or friends, it also 
validates the idea of time spent alone during the holidays. A solo walk in the 
woods or at the beach can be as important as having friends over to decorate a 
Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Stewart, international president of Parents Without Partners, a 
support group for single parents, encourages seeking the support of friends and 
family to survive the season, especially if it is the first without a loved 
one. 
</P>
<P>
"Do not pass up any invitation to parties or other social gatherings. Keeping 
your calendar full will not give you the time to dwell on depressing emotions," 
Stewart says. 
</P>
<P>
The booklet is available free through clubs, churches and other nonprofit 
organizations or from Great Expectations, "Holiday Blues," 11040 Santa Monica 
Blvd., Los Angeles, Calif. 90025.

PARTIES THE TIFFANY WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Loring, senior vice president and design director of Tiffany &amp; Co., 
has written his fifth book, "Tiffany Parties" (Doubleday, $60), chronicling 
some of the most lavish events of the decade, from the Reagans' last White 
House state dinner -- decorated with peach-colored rose trees -- to Patricia 
Kluge's birthday party at the Waldorf-Astoria Grand Ballroom in New York, awash 
with 1 million flowers. Like the stores he represents, Loring has become 
synonymous with taste and style. He recently talked about his new book. 
</P>
<P>
Question: Who puts on the best parties? Charities? Corporations? Tycoons? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: It's charities in general. There are more important minds at work. A 
big charity fund-raising ball will have an honorary chairman -- usually a 
public figure -- who probably is not going to do any real work on the party but 
will put her stamp on it. There will usually be two co-chairmen who actually do 
the most work. Then there is a committee of at least a dozen social ladies who 
will work, too. That's 14 major minds and personalities focused on this one 
party. A private party has one mind focused on it. It could turn out very well, 
but the chances are that 99% of the time it won't turn out as well as the party 
done by the chair ladies and their committee. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Has entertaining on a grand scale become grander? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, entertaining has become better designed and more exciting. People have 
always entertained on a grand scale, but it was uniform and stereotyped until 
the '80s. In this decade, party designers, florists and caterers brought an 
entirely new look to entertaining that wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What exactly have these professional party people brought to the table? 
</P>
<P>
A: They brought a sense of fantasy that takes a party into an area where it 
belongs, a world where all realities of daily life are suspended. Now you find 
yourself in a magic palace, which is invigorating and restful and gives people 
an opportunity to behave in a different way than they would with the cares and 
aggravations of daily life surrounding them. In the old days, big parties 
tended to be costumed. Well, the costume party is obviously a thing of the 
past. Now it's the rooms themselves that are costumed. 
</P>
<P>
Q: It used to be that people made a party great -- is it the environment what 
matters now? 
</P>
<P>
A: People definitely make a party great, but people behave in a more 
interesting way if they're surrounded by a fanciful environment. 
</P>
<P>
Q: When you enter a party, what do you notice first? 
</P>
<P>
A: I notice the people first and the decoration almost at the same time. Less 
tangible is the feel of the place, if there is a sense of event in the air. If 
a party is successful, everyone is electrically charged. If you walk into a 
party and feel people have skimped either in the guest list, the decoration, or 
the guests themselves have skimped on their clothing and jewels, you're not 
going to have a very exciting time. Those are not the successful parties that 
make all the money for charities and cultural institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Does that mean that simple parties are doomed these days? 
</P>
<P>
A: We're not talking about simple parties. Having three friends in for dinner 
is wonderful in its own way. Our subject is grand parties. And you absolutely 
simply cannot have a simple charity ball. You can choose to have a simple 
theme. In New York, we might have a Western theme for a party, and everyone 
whoops with laughter as the great social ladies walk in with Paul Bunyan 
lumberjack shirts and blue jeans and cowboy boots. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are some parties distinctly Los Angeles or New York or Dallas? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think we're pretty homogenized nationally on these things. Remember, all 
of the flowers from one part of the world are transported to the other in a 
matter of hours by plane, and everybody with modern communication is aware five 
minutes later of what everyone else did. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Since your interest is obviously china, silver, crystal -- Tiffany products 
-- how do party 
</P>
<P>
givers deal with those items in a hotel or public place? 
</P>
<P>
A: You don't expect a dinner of 800 served on fine porcelain. You expect things 
that will survive an industrial dishwasher. No one I know has 800 of anything. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Did the Reagan years truly influence social style? 
</P>
<P>
A: I certainly think so. The Reagan White House, with all the beautiful dinner 
parties, was a kind of green light for people to think about the big party as 
an American phenomenon and something that could be used to raise money for big 
institutions, just as it was used to bring glamour and dignity to the 
Washington government. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about the Bush style? 
</P>
<P>
A: The Bush style is a more relaxed, all-American, homey style than the 
Reagans'. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How did your editor Jacqueline Onassis' touch show up in the book? 
</P>
<P>
A: She was a great help to me in identifying which public buildings were the 
most important ones to represent, and also her rightful, constant insistence 
that the book's theme be on the use of public spaces for fund-raising events. 
She, as I, leaned toward parties where there was some real magic in the event, 
and it wasn't simply a massing of chairs and tables. We both leaned away from 
parties where there was a major flaw that called you back to reality. This was 
a credit to all of the women who produced these parties. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What would your ideal party be like? 
</P>
<P>
A: My own preference is for parties given in architecturally extraordinary 
environments. Almost every city has a library or museum or even the stage of a 
theater that is an exceptional piece of architecture. I prefer that to a tent 
pitched in a public park. It lacks the drama. To give a party in a hotel 
ballroom misses a lot of the flavor of the great American party. The party we 
did for the publication of the book took place in the Metropolitan Club, a 
great Stanford White room. It's a great masterpiece of American architecture, 
and it's a space in constant use for raising funds. I also liked the party we 
photographed in Union Station in Washington, D.C. Who would have thought of 
giving a party in a train station? I liked the architectural underpinning to 
the whole event. It's a solid structure to build a party on. It's exciting to 
go into what I call palaces of the people, and it's exciting to go to a palace 
for a party, even if that palace is a train station.

A MIDWESTERN CANYON

For the most part, Amy Wooley likes California. "I came here 10 years ago from 
Ohio, and I'm a California girl," she says. "I love the ocean -- walking on the 
beach near Malibu, picking up seashells, listening to the waves. They make a 
great background for writing songs." 
</P>
<P>
But about this time of year she finds herself yearning for the crisp, wintry 
atmosphere of a Norman Rockwell Midwest Christmas. And she knows where to find 
a facsimile. 
</P>
<P>
"I know this sounds crazy, but when you drive through Topanga Canyon Pass, 
there is one little green section with a stream and trees -- pines and maples 
with leaves that change colors with the seasons. It's just the shortest 
stretch, and it's not Ohio, but it gives me a homey feeling. That's where I've 
been sneaking off to these last few weeks, when I'm in the holiday mood." 
</P>
<P>
For Wooley, a songwriter-composer who completed her bachelor's degree in music 
composition at UCLA this year, the little Topanga stretch of pines and maples 
recaptures her favorite Christmas ritual memory -- bringing home the tree. 
</P>
<P>
"It reminds me of the Rocky River Valley in Ohio where we used to drive home in 
our station wagon after buying our tree on Christmas Eve. Daddy was a school 
teacher, and we had a big family -- five children. So we would wait until 
Christmas Eve, when the trees were marked down, and then buy the biggest one we 
could find, usually a spruce. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we would drive the long way home to Lakewood through the valley. It was 
fun because we were all in the car together with the tree, singing carols. My 
family is all musical and we sing in harmony. 'Silent Night' was a biggie with 
us because it has great harmony. 'Joy to the World' is my favorite. My mother's 
favorite was 'O Little Town of Bethlehem.' All the kids liked 'The First Noel' 
because you get those high notes at the end. 
</P>
<P>
"Our happy times were being together in the station wagon. I don't have any 
better memories: It was Christmas, we were happy, we were kids. That was it, 
boy!" 
</P>
<P>
Wooley recorded one solo album as a performer but is concentrating on 
composition. She is writing a pop opera based on Steinbeck's "Grapes of Wrath." 
And because she recently started teaching music at the Neighborhood Nursery 
School at Westwood Hills Congregational Church, she is interested in children's 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're real focused on Christmas right now, and I wrote one song -- a descant 
for 'Silent Night' called 'Peace on Earth.' I play the guitar, and the kids 
love it. So once again, I'm singing harmony with kids -- my Christmas 
favorite." CONNIE KOENNEN

LATE-NIGHT REVERIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For Parisian-born costume and fabric designer Rolande Guizart, the holiday 
season calls up memories of bustling streets, crowded cafes and fairy-like 
window displays offering the delectable ingredients of the traditional French 
midnight dinner, the reveillon, served on Christmas and New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
To capture that ambience in Los Angeles, Guizart drops in at Santa Monica's 
Boulangerie, a big French Basque cafe, restaurant and deli. 
</P>
<P>
Tucked away from freeways and palm trees, the cafe is planted with greenery, 
offers a tempting mix of wine and food and buzzes with morning conversations. 
"It's a little piece of France," says Guizart, who likes to watch the comings 
and goings of families, the nods and smiles of couples and the frowns of 
intellectuals behind their newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody hurries you on your way," says Guizart, who lingers over a morning's 
cappuccino and croissant, prolonging a relaxing moment between business 
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
The deli combines a number of French food shops and their specialties -- the 
boulangerie for bread, the patisserie for sweets, the charcuterie for pates and 
catered hors d'oeuvres. Through an archway Guizart eyes the delicacies of a 
typical French reveillon. 
</P>
<P>
"In France, the holidays mean the reveillon," says Guizart, who points out that 
whether rich or poor, her compatriots will spend their money on that feast. 
Oysters, foie gras and turkey stuffed with chestnut dressing are served in 
successive courses, accompanied by champagne and topped with the traditional 
cake, the buche de Noel. Made in the form of a Yule log, the buche is decorated 
with tiny figures of a woodsman, forest elves and mushroom sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
For Guizart, buying a buche in Los Angeles is rediscovering a symbol of the 
season's magic. "When I was in Paris, I could stand in front of the food shop 
windows for hours at Christmas. They were so fabulous, they made you want to 
eat even when you weren't hungry." ELIZABETH VENANT

A MOUNTAIN ESCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vicky Panossian fled Beirut eight years ago to escape Lebanon's endless civil 
war, leaving her father, mother and a sister behind. The claustrophobia of 
staying inside to hide from the shelling and the fear of being shot by snipers 
when she ventured outside, drove her to Canada. A few months later, she came to 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her powerful reasons for leaving Lebanon, Panossian, an Armenian 
Christian, says she misses her family and her homeland. And over the years the 
gulf of separation from her family -- as well as the long-gone, easy-going ways 
of pre-war Lebanon -- has come to seem especially wide during the holidays, she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"The feeling of belonging is so important, and I didn't know that until I came 
here," she explains, noting that her aging parents prefer the known dangers of 
Beirut to the uncertainties of sprawling Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
To fill the emotional gap, Panossian, who works for an oil company, has tried 
to replace the friendliness and family closeness of her best Lebanese years 
with the American vision of the Christmas landscape -- snow-covered ground, 
brisk days, clear starry nights and the cozy warmth of a forest cabin in the 
California mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm substituting that (family) warmth with the snow and the stars in the sky," 
she says. "I guess you try to create an inner atmosphere because you don't have 
that togetherness . . . You can have some kind of peace with nature." 
</P>
<P>
That's been her solution for two Christmases, and she plans a similar retreat 
this year. It will also be a welcome break from the hyper-pace and emotional 
grayness of city life. 
</P>
<P>
"In Los Angeles you don't have time to complete your feelings," she says. "You 
don't have time to even miss someone." GARRY ABRAMS

CELEBRATION IN A PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chestnuts roasting on an open flame do it for some people. But for Isaac 
Urquidi, it's the scent of roasting pine nuts that takes him back to 
Christmases past. 
</P>
<P>
Half Mescalero Apache and half Basque, Urquidi's family celebrated the season 
as a Christian holiday and in traditional Indian fashion. 
</P>
<P>
It was the family's Apache roots that led them each year to a river bank lined 
with cottonwoods near the small eastern Arizona mining town in which they 
lived. 
</P>
<P>
There, they and other Apache families celebrated winter ceremony, with 
traditional "give-away" gift exchanges, prayers to Mother Earth and the cooking 
of tamales, meats, chilies, corn tortillas, corn soups and pine nuts on an open 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
"The smell of pine nuts, even to this day -- even thinking about it right now 
-- reaches my senses, and I feel a little bit homesick," said Urquidi, a social 
worker with the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Cazabat, a Creek Seminole from Oklahoma, was raised a Methodist, but her 
parents also passed on traditional Indian ways. Now she works as a banking 
automation consultant, and she too encounters a nostalgia of blended traditions 
this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Like many American Indians from distant cultures who live in this polyglot 
megalopolis, Cazabat and Urquidi will counter their homesickness by joining up 
to 5,000 other Indians in Bell Garden's Ford Park on Saturday for the fifth 
annual Childrens' Christmas Party. 
</P>
<P>
The party is dedicated to children of the Indian community, and includes such 
non-Indian touches as Santa Claus and elves. Afterward, the adults will throw 
themselves a pow wow with traditional dancing and food. For Cazabat, the 
highlight is conversing with people in her Creek language. "It's like taking a 
quick trip home," she said. BOB SIPCHEN

AN EARLY MIDNIGHT

<P>
Just before 4 p.m. on New Year's Eve, Linda Hall of Santa Monica will join many 
of her fellow Britons in ringing in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Noisemakers in mouths, colorful hats on heads, they will count down the seconds 
to the magic hour, and will join in singing Auld Lang Syne. 
</P>
<P>
Because that is when it will be midnight in the land of their roots. They will 
be at Ye Olde King's Head in Santa Monica, a pub that for 16 years has served 
as a reunion center for many of the estimated 60,000 British passport holders 
and 300,000 to 500,000 Britons who live in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
"In England, everybody goes to a local pub, not just for eating and drinking, 
but to catch up on the gossip and to socialize," said Hall, an executive 
secretary and British citizen who has lived here with her husband, John, for 
six years. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want a plumber to fix your place, you can either find one at the pub, 
or else somebody will be there who knows of a good one." 
</P>
<P>
Such typical British gathering places, Hall said, aren't at all like the usual 
American counterparts: "Here (bars) are usually dark. A man goes there and sits 
in a dark corner, slugs a few martinis, and goes home to face his wife." 
</P>
<P>
She said she and the others at the King's Head like to spend time perusing the 
newspapers brought in by British flight crews, and left around for anyone to 
scan. Some throw darts, some browse the overseas soccer scores that are posted 
and some drink British beer and eat bangers (sausages) for a taste of home.

AIDS WRITERS LOOK AT STRATEGIES TO DEAL WITH A WARY SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
WRITERS: DIFFERENT APPROACHES ARE NECESSARY FOR TV, FILM AND THEATER, WRITERS 
AND DRAMATISTS GUILD MEMBERS REPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mount a panel discussion titled "Writing About AIDS," match a playwright with 
movie and TV writers, and the results aren't necessarily what one would expect. 
</P>
<P>
Held Monday at the Writers' Guild West headquarters and sponsored by the 
Writers Guild and the Dramatists Guild (and moderated by the guild's president, 
David LeVine), the seminar might have led some to expect a how-to discussion on 
writing the ideal AIDS drama. What they heard instead was how writers tackle a 
socially controversial subject, write their script, run them through very 
different media gauntlets -- and find how some media are more accepting of 
sensitive material than others. 
</P>
<P>
"Dealing with stories about AIDS is really about dealing with a system," said 
Carl Sautter, who scripted an episode of "Trapper John M.D." that addressed 
aspects of the disease. "The key for writers is to know how to work within the 
system that exists. There's always someone meddling with the script. It's not 
that the system won't deal with AIDS. It's wary of any tough subject." 
</P>
<P>
Sautter was actually referring to two systems: television and the networks, 
pincered by the dual censors of sponsors and the ubiquitous standards and 
practices overseers; and movies and the studios, where a relative lack of 
censorship is mitigated by financial concerns brought about by big budgets and 
bigger career risks. 
</P>
<P>
There is a third system, the theater, represented on the panel by William 
Hoffman, author of one of the first AIDS-themed plays, "As Is." 
</P>
<P>
Sautter, "Midnight Caller" supervising producer Stephen Zito and Ron Cowen and 
Daniel Lipman, co-scenarists of the Emmy-winning AIDS drama, "An Early Frost," 
related the obstacles to getting their stories on the air -- ranging from 
network skittishness over suggestions that elderly female characters could like 
the gay characters, to pressures from AIDS advocacy groups that their concerns 
not be left on the cutting room floor. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman told a different story. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote 'As Is' out of a despair that no one was talking about how my friends 
were dying," he said, "and the writing literally stopped any suicidal 
tendencies I felt. I wanted to hit people below the belt with this, so I 
expected trouble from (producers and theater management). But there was none -- 
just the opposite. I hated writing it, and the only reason I finished it was 
hearing the supportive reactions from workshop and preview audiences. They 
would say, 'You're kicking us in the guts, but keep doing it.' " 
</P>
<P>
That's how theater works, when it's working well. "The TV writer," Cowen said, 
"is writing for Wichita, not off-Broadway New York. It was too important to get 
the message out about this disease, so if we inserted an early scene with two 
men in bed together, you would hear the channels clicking across America. 
</P>
<P>
"Dan (Lipman) and I were terrified of AIDS when we started our research. We 
were so ignorant, and so were the patients we interviewed. One guy was positive 
that he got the disease from a dirty glass in a bar. So we couldn't assume that 
an audience knew about AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Contradicting the notion that theater audiences are aware of AIDS-related 
issues, Hoffman added that he, too, wrote his play "for people who didn't know 
about the disease." 
</P>
<P>
LeVine and his guests, recognizing the mass media's responsibility to expand 
public awareness of the epidemic, lamented the lack of TV and movie dramas 
addressing the issue. "Instead of dealing with gay men," Cowen said bitterly, 
"they put out dozens of stories about hemophiliac kids, who make up a tragic 
but very small number of AIDS cases. I think these programs and the people who 
do them are disgusting, since they send out two wrong messages: that gays are 
responsible for AIDS, and that it's not safe to get blood." 
</P>
<P>
As for the next big AIDS drama, Hoffman suggested the stories of AIDS 
activists. "They're one of the most exciting movements in the U.S. A few, 
committed people have actually changed government policy (on drug research to 
curb AIDS). It's a great story of our time, and it's under-reported."

PANEL OFFERS LITTLE DIRECTION ON DRAMATURGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The title of the second Dramatists' Guild symposium Tuesday at Theatre West was 
"How to Use a Dramaturg." But get a few dramaturgs together and the discussion 
is likely to gravitate to the question of what they actually do. 
</P>
<P>
Few people know. In the first place, as panelist Grant Moran, a film and 
television writer with a long history of dramaturging, pointed out, the word 
itself, inherited from the German, is off-putting. All those hard consonants. 
</P>
<P>
In the second, it "gives you a variety of functions," said Stephen Weeks, 
literary co-manager of the Los Angeles Theatre Center. So many, that they're 
nebulous at best. 
</P>
<P>
Moderator Peter Stone, president of the guild, tried to anchor the job 
description. He cited one that viewed the dramaturg as the person who 
"champions the text . . . represents and sometimes justifies the writer to the 
director." It never got more specific. 
</P>
<P>
The dramaturgs, it emerged, see themselves as everything -- from hand-holders 
to the playwright (Moran and Susan Vaneta Moran who co-directs the Women's 
Project at LATC and once served there as dramaturg) to liaison officer, adviser 
and peacemaker, but always a job that's "intimate," "sensitive," "complex," 
"reactive" and never, never, that of a rewriter. 
</P>
<P>
That is the sympathetic view. 
</P>
<P>
Things got tougher when Stone mentioned knottier issues. What does a dramaturg 
do if a theater or director alters a script in a major way without a writer's 
permission? Where is the dramaturg's allegiance then? 
</P>
<P>
The answers were less satisfying. Moran merely asserted it was an improper 
thing for a theater to do. Another panelist suggested that "firing the director 
is an option" (to which Stone retorted: "Well, it's a drastic solution, but 
popular with playwrights."). 
</P>
<P>
Fundamentally, though, Stone did keep the session focused on the nuts and bolts 
of a dramaturg's work, outlining the differences between literary managers 
(more focused on sniffing out good plays) and dramaturgs (the hands-on players 
who work one-to-one with playwrights on new writing). 
</P>
<P>
Jose Cruz Gonzalez, project director for South Coast Repertory's Hispanic 
Playwrights Project and director of the comedy group, "Latins Anonymous" (now 
at LATC), and Armando Molina, a member of "Latins Anonymous" and some-time 
dramaturg, showed that working improvisationally is yet still another ballgame. 
Actors and director/dramaturg doing the writing together is a kind of elaborate 
buddy system predicated on everyone's willingness to give and take. 
</P>
<P>
As a whole, though, the emphasis by the panel was on presenting too saintly an 
image of the dramaturg as a benevolent, non-interfering, enlightened friend in 
court -- a view Tuesday's small audience did not refute, but seemed to keep at 
arm's length during a brief question-and-answer period. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, a droll image of the dramaturg as seat belt emerged -- protective 
for the playwright on his or her wild ride, but its enforcement often resisted 
by directors. 
</P>
<P>
If the word dramaturg creates a gathering storm in some playwrights' minds, let 
them ponder a coming new breed of middleman known as the psychoturg or drama 
therapist. No confusion over those job descriptions. A subject, Stone said, for 
the next symposium.

FANS ACCEPT TURN OF EVENTS ON 'BEAUTY, BEAST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN and SUE MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All through the summer, loyal fans worried and wrote letters protesting CBS' 
placing "Beauty and the Beast" on hiatus for retooling. They worried about 
pregnant "Beauty" Linda Hamilton leaving the show to have her baby. They 
fretted over the producers' decision to stress action over romance to woo the 
male viewer. Most of all, they worried that CBS would never bring "Beauty and 
the Beast" back at all. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday night, the "Beast" was back -- with a two-hour season opener that 
killed off Linda Hamilton's character, featured much violence and mayhem and 
proved that chaste romance can't last forever as Catherine gave birth to a 
child fathered by Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that, as CBS warned, "it's not a fairy tale anymore," however, 
fans appeared Wednesday to have accepted the changes with little protest. 
</P>
<P>
CBS reported "no more calls than usual" following the episode, and Witt-Thomas 
Productions received no immediate protest, said co-executive producer Paul 
Junger Witt. 
</P>
<P>
"We did our best to explain what the situation was, and to reassure (fans) that 
the essence of 'Beauty and the Beast' would be retained. . . . We honestly 
don't think we compromised," Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
Fans, for the most part, agreed. None contacted by The Times on Wednesday 
objected to the end of Catherine and Vincent's chaste status. And only one of 
those interviewed, Donna Koich, 44, of Warminster, Pa., criticized the new, 
more violent Vincent as "a furry Incredible Hulk." 
</P>
<P>
"I was well-pleased," said Stephanie Wiltse, 35, of Albany, N.Y. "You have 
Romeo and Juliet, except that Romeo survives, and there's a child. I don't 
think the violence was gratuitous; there was a balletic feel to it." 
</P>
<P>
Kimberly Hartman, 33, of Fullerton remained eager to see how the story will 
develop, but wished that Catherine and Vincent had gotten married before 
consummating their relationship, in the tradition of mythic fables. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Hamburg of North Hollywood did not mind Catherine and Vincent's getting a 
little closer: "It was getting almost contrived that they could go for two 
years without even a kiss," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But she doesn't want Vincent to fall in love with another woman this season. 
"I'm going to have a major problem with this, after they set up Catherine as 
being his life, his soul," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The program garnered a 13.3 rating (about 12.2 million homes) and 24% of the 
available audience. Last season "Beauty and the Beast" averaged a 10.6 rating 
(9.6 million homes) and an 18 share.

IS THERE A RATINGS DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE?; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: CBS GIVES 'ISLAND SON' A NEW TIME SLOT, MOVING IT FROM TUESDAY TO 
THURSDAY.

"There are strange, large forces at work in this business of getting a show on 
the air," Richard Chamberlain mused. 
</P>
<P>
The very civilized Chamberlain -- lunching on the Hawaiian fish mahi mahi in 
the noonday sun, immaculate in crisp casual clothes in coordinated shades of 
mint green -- would not be so impolite as to blame anyone for the fact that his 
new CBS medical series, "Island Son," is foundering in the Nielsen ratings. It 
ranks 61st among 85 network prime-time series this season. 
</P>
<P>
The closest Chamberlain comes to pointing a finger is to note that the series, 
which marks the former Dr. Kildare's return to TV as a physician, had somehow 
veered off course as a result of the aforementioned strange, large forces -- 
and that the show's producers are now struggling to get it back. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can ever blame anything on anyone else," Chamberlain said 
evenly. "Well, maybe once in a while -- but it doesn't do any good. I mean, I 
could say a few things that weren't handled just right, but then, there are a 
few things that I didn't handle just right either." 
</P>
<P>
Although declining to offer specifics, Chamberlain said the first episodes of 
the show were rush jobs due to delays and illnesses among the cast and crew. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, in an effort to improve its fortunes, "Island Son" gets a new 9 p.m. 
time slot, moving from Tuesdays at 10. Although some might call the new 
position a death slot opposite NBC's popular comedies "Cheers" and "Dear John," 
Chamberlain said he prefers it. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a stronger lead-in ("48 Hours") and lead-out ("Knots Landing")," said 
the veteran actor, who also serves as executive producer of the series. 
</P>
<P>
That's not the only change afoot. As quickly as new scripts can be written, 
Chamberlain said, the show will widen its focus beyond the hospital walls to 
better utilize the show's lush Hawaiian setting. 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain's Dr. Daniel Kulani will also widen the scope of the show with more 
house calls, and his ex-wife will show up to stir up a little trouble in his 
personal life. 
</P>
<P>
He has not yet gotten the green light from the network, but Chamberlain hopes 
the show not only will move outside the hospital, but also will focus more on 
traditional island medical techniques than on modern medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people will find it much more interesting when we are dealing with 
genuine Hawaiian issues, and much more with the personal problems and dramas of 
the regulars," he said. "I think what is no longer wildly interesting to people 
is pure medical stuff: 'It's your gall bladder, ma'am.' " 
</P>
<P>
He also believes that, despite the failures of Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van 
Dyke in their return to series television last season, they want to see 
familiar faces -- provided they have the right vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the show, the energy and the person," he said. "There's not a rule in the 
book that can't be broken with the right energy, the right concept." 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain said that, as executive producer of his show, he must avoid the 
trap of fashioning his own character as a white-coated hero in the mold of the 
Dr. Kildare character he played from 1961-66, particularly in the wake of more 
realistic medical shows such as "St. Elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people in the audience long for that 
simplicity, but I don't think they quite believe it anymore," he said. 
"Ideally, I'd like to see him (Dr. Kulani) as a man on the brink of a lot of 
discovery. . . . I see him as somewhat driven, which makes trouble with his 
relationships. I want to see him more and more in a position where he has to 
learn something, rather than teaching some kind of moral lesson."

PEOPLE: UCI COURSE ZEROES IN ON WOMEN'S ROLE IN WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's clear, says Juliet MacCannell, that women at home are in as much danger as 
soldiers in the field if a nuclear or conventional war were to erupt. 
</P>
<P>
And that's one of the reasons that the UC Irvine associate professor is 
teaching a course entitled "Women and War" in the English/comparative 
literature department. 
</P>
<P>
"Some truths can only be taught in literary form," said the Irvine resident, 
who holds degrees from UC Riverside and Cornell University. "And I've been 
interested and very concerned in the deep transformation in the arrangement 
between the sexes." 
</P>
<P>
MacCannell, director of women's studies, said she has an interest in the "grand 
social movements" in the world and that includes what would happen in the event 
of a war. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone would become a soldier at home even if it is a conventional war," 
said MacCannell, an author and world traveler who rarely takes a trip for the 
fun of it. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of years ago, I took a cruise for a week where I could relax, and I 
remember that trip very clearly," she said. "It seems as if I'm constantly busy 
now and I really don't like that. Everyone needs time to relax." Her class, 
which may be unique in the academic establishment throughout the country, has 
attracted 40 students, most of them women. 
</P>
<P>
"We get into some lively discussions," said MacCannell who, flies to the Bay 
Area on weekends to be with her husband, Dean MacCannell, a professor at UC 
Davis. "It's a stimulating class, and it has its own kind of excitement." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the discussions are motivated by reading 10 novels and textbooks that 
define the role of women during a time of crisis. She said it gives students a 
look at their possible participation if a conflict were to arise. 
</P>
<P>
The books relate male roles during wartime, but some describe the role of women 
during the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
MacCannell noted that in World War II, when men went off to fight in combat, 
women were prepared for their role such as "Rosie the Riveter" and others who 
helped build fighting machines and raise money for the war effort. 
</P>
<P>
She tells her students that they are part of a generation whose roles could be 
different if another war were to occur. 
</P>
<P>
However, she feels that if students taking the course understand the linking of 
women and war, it could help avert another one. 
</P>
<P>
Besides teaching in college all her adult life, MacCannell has written two 
books. Her third effort, "The Regime of the Brother," a study of literary texts 
from the 18th Century to the present, will be published next year. 
</P>
<P>
Before deciding on teaching, MacCannell had thoughts of becoming an artist "but 
I had a very inquiring mind and probably wouldn't have been happy," she said. 
"I have a more critical than creative mind, and in the long run, I made the 
right move." 
</P>
<P>
But she added: "It's interesting that I started thinking the other way." 
</P>
<P>
During the holiday season, it's always fun to hear Santa Claus when he uses the 
ham radio call letters WD6 BPT at St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center 
in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
He identifies the station as Whiskey Delta 6, Bed Pan Trainer. 
</P>
<P>
The medical facility has had a ham radio since October, 1977. It was donated to 
the hospital by the wife of a ham operator who died, coincidentally at a time 
when April Moell, the hospital's director of occupational therapy, had just 
received her ham license. 
</P>
<P>
She set up a Rehab Radio program to help patients with speech skills, 
coordination, socializing and to expand their attention span. 
</P>
<P>
It was also used to direct heavy equipment to certain locations in San 
Francisco after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Ray, 10, of Fountain Valley and a student at Roch Courreges Elementary 
School, writes for Bare Essentials, a kid's monthly newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
She just got her biggest scoop. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very nice man and was talking like a regular, normal human being," 
she said of her 30-minute interview with Ronald Reagan in Century City.. 
</P>
<P>
She had written the former President months ago asking for the interview, which 
she said touched on a number of subjects. 
</P>
<P>
And as a final gesture, she said, Reagan played Taps on his harmonica. 
</P>
<P>
"He said it was the only song he really knew how to play," Eleanor observed. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- Dr. Kent Wright, an El Toro equine veterinarian, was picked

UC IRVINE FALLS FLAT IN COLORADO; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: STILL WITHOUT THEIR TOP TWO POINT GUARDS, ANTEATERS FIND NO 
RELIEF IN A 98-83 DEFEAT.

<P>
Football fever has swept across the University of Colorado campus. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Bowl is only 2 1/2 weeks away and locals can't wait until the No. 
1-ranked Buffaloes play Notre Dame for a chance to win the national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's why only 2,234 watched Colorado play UC Irvine Wednesday in the 
11,199-seat Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, maybe the folks in Boulder have seen Irvine play this season. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine, hobbled by injuries to its point guards, couldn't keep pace with 
Colorado and lost, 98-83. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters (1-5) are off to their worst start since the school began playing 
basketball in 1965. Colorado is 7-1 and off to its best start in years. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine didn't play any better a mile high than it has at sea level this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters' offense was sluggish, they committed a season-high 24 turnovers, 
13 in the first half, and they shot less than 50% from the field for the third 
consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our offense is not executing anything right now," said Jeff Herdman, 
who led Irvine with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't blame that all on injuries. (We're doing) nothing. It's 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Rod Palmer missed his second game in a row with a sprained knee. 
Backup Ben Rishwain is sidelined by a broken index finger. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine missed Palmer dearly, but neither Herdman, who also had 13 rebounds, nor 
Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan would use it as an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts us," Mulligan said. "We're supposed to bring it up by committee. 
(But) they lose their poise and do whatever they want." 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan tried Mike Labat, a forward, and shooting guards Craig Marshall and 
Dylan Rigdon at point guard, but no one was effective. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had all those turnovers in the first half and they all seemed to 
result in baskets," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine stayed close until Colorado guard Stevie Wise hit a three-point basket 
that gave the Buffaloes a 29-20 lead with 6:12 left in the half. The lead grew 
to 44-31 by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Wise put the game out of reach by hitting three three-pointers to begin the 
second half, the last giving Colorado a 53-33 lead. The Buffaloes led by as 
many as 28 points late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Wise had 29 to lead Colorado. Center Shaun Vandiver added 16 and Rodell Guest 
13. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Colorado's press had something to do with the Anteaters' woes. 
</P>
<P>
Wise and fellow guard Reggie Morton swarmed the Irvine guards continually. Wise 
had two steals on the press early, setting the tone for the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't handle their press and couldn't get into our offense," Mulligan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado Coach Tom Miller also thought the press was a key. 
</P>
<P>
"We rattled them," Miller said. "Stevie and Reggie did a good job applying 
pressure. We couldn't sit back and let them dictate the tempo." 
</P>
<P>
Colorado had little trouble solving Irvine's zone defense in the first half. 
The Anteaters sagged in on Vandiver, who came into the game averaging 24.9 
points. 
</P>
<P>
That part worked fine. Vandiver did not dominate the middle, but when he got 
double-teamed inside he passed the ball outside to Wise for open jumpers. 
</P>
<P>
Wise made 12 of 17 shots, including five of eight from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew Stevie Wise could really shoot the ball," Mulligan said. "We tried a 
zone and tried man-to-man. We tried to stop Vandiver in the zone, but Wise kept 
knocking them down all night." 
</P>
<P>
It all added up to another trying night in what has already become a 
frustrating season for Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we've got to start playing harder," Herdman said. 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
Justin Anderson had 18 points, 13 in the second half, off the bench for Irvine. 
He made seven of 10 from the field. Rob Doktorczyk and Jeff Von Lutzow had 11 
each, the only other Anteaters in double figures. . . . Irvine plays host to 
San Diego State at 7:30 p.m. Saturday at the Bren Center.

PREP FOOTBALL ALL-STARS 1989;

SERRA AND CARSON PLACE FOUR PLAYERS EACH ON FIRST TEAM

<P>
An appropriate theme for The Times South Bay All-Star High School Football Team 
would be "To the victors go the spoils." 
</P>
<P>
Serra, which captured its first CIF-Southern Section football title Saturday 
with a 34-31 win over Lompoc in the Division VII final, and Carson, heading 
into the L.A. City Section 4-A championship game Friday night, dominate the 
all-star squad. 
</P>
<P>
Each placed four players on the 23-member first team, which will be honored 
Sunday at The Times High School Football Awards Brunch at the Anaheim Hilton. 
Stanford Coach Dennis Green is the guest speaker. 
</P>
<P>
Winners of the South Bay Coach, Back and Lineman of the Year awards will be 
announced at the 9 a.m. brunch. 
</P>
<P>
Serra, under first-year Coach Leo Hand, put the finishing touches on a 14-0 
season with a hard-fought victory over unbeaten Lompoc at El Camino College. It 
marked only the second time in the 1980s that a South Bay football team ended 
the year with a perfect record. West Torrance was 14-0 in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Serra is represented on the all-star team by fullback Dennis Gerard, tackle 
Kenny Thomas, linebacker Steven Johnson and safety Clayton Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
Carson (10-1) will try to win back-to-back L.A. City titles for the first time 
since 1972 at 7:30 p.m. Friday against Pacific League rival Dorsey (9-3) in the 
4-A Division final at El Camino College. The Colts have won four City 
championships in the '80s, seven overall. 
</P>
<P>
Carson players selected to the all-star first team are quarterback Armin 
Youngblood, wide receiver Michael Ross, linebacker Nkosi Littleton and 
cornerback Clayvand Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
After Serra and Carson, five schools placed two players each on the all-star 
team: Ocean League champion West Torrance, Bay League co-champions Hawthorne 
and Palos Verdes, Leuzinger and Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Bay topped all leagues with eight selections, followed by the Pacific, 
Ocean and Camino Real with four each. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the offense are wide receiver Eric Hansen of North Torrance, 
linemen Robert Ferkula of South Torrance, Kyle Holderman of Palos Verdes, Jim 
Justice of Leuzinger and Corey Miller of San Pedro, running backs Chris 
Alexander of Hawthorne and Robert Coulter of Rolling Hills and kicker Angel 
Andrade of Leuzinger. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the defensive unit is made up of linemen Jae Kim of West, Chris 
Maumalanga of Bishop Montgomery and Kenny Talanoa of El Segundo, linebackers 
Sione Mahe of Hawthorne and Jim Rudberg of Rolling Hills and defensive backs 
Mark Antrobius of Palos Verdes and Josh Moore of West. 
</P>
<P>
A closer look at the all-stars: 
</P>
<P>
WIDE RECEIVERS: 
</P>
<P>
Eric Hansen (North Torrance) -- The state's leading receiver at the end of the 
regular season, Hansen caught a South Bay-record 84 passes for 1,224 yards and 
six touchdowns in 10 games. His single-season total ranks eighth on the 
all-time Southern Section list. Said Coach Don Bohannon: "He was our offense." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ross (Carson) -- Entering Friday's L.A. City Section 4-A title game, 
Ross has 46 catches for 862 yards (19.2 average) and 15 touchdowns. He holds 
virtually every school receiving record, eclipsing past Carson stars such as 
Wesley Walker, Michael Wilson and Derek Hill, all members of NFL teams. Ross is 
known for his sure hands, leaping ability and knack for making catches in 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
OFFENSIVE LINEMEN: 
</P>
<P>
Robert Ferkula (South Torrance) -- Chosen the Ocean League Offensive Lineman of 
the Year, Ferkula helped pave the way for a productive running attack for the 
Ocean runners-up, who averaged nearly 200 yards rushing a game. 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Holderman (Palos Verdes) -- The top lineman and strongest player for the 
Bay League co-champions, Holderman was a standout two-way starter. "A tough, 
tough lineman," Coach Bill Judy said. "He's quick and constantly had to be 
double-teamed (on defense)." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Justice (Leuzinger) -- Rated the Olympians' No. 1 player by Coach Steve 
Carnes, the aggressive Justice anchored a line that helped Leuzinger average 
250 yards rushing a game and reach the quarterfinals of the Southern Section 
Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Thomas (Serra) -- The top lineman for the Southern Section Division VII 
champions, Thomas was a consistent performer at righttackle and helped Serra 
rush for more than 4,000 yards in 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Miller (San Pedro) -- Considered one of San Pedro's best blockers in 
recent years by Coach Henry Pacheco, Miller helped the Pirates capture the 
Southern League title with his steady play at center. 
</P>
<P>
QUARTERBACK: 
</P>
<P>
Armin Youngblood (Carson) -- A gifted athlete, Youngblood made the transition 
from running back to quarterback this season and has set several of the 
school's single-season passing records heading into Friday's championship game. 
He has completed 117 of 229 attempts (51%) for 2,306 yards and 30 touchdowns to 
lead the Colts to their ninth consecutive appearance in an L.A. City final. 
</P>
<P>
RUNNING BACKS: 
</P>
<P>
Chris Alexander (Hawthorne) -- Named the Bay League Co-Most Valuable Player, 
Alexander used his sprinter's speed (he placed fifth in the state 100 meters 
last spring) to rush for 1,133 yards on 122 carries (a 9.3 average) and score 
17 touchdowns, including a 99-yard kickoff return in the playoffs against San 
Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Coulter (Rolling Hills) -- The only junior on the first-team offense, 
Coulter led South Bay rushers during the regular season with 1,545 yards and 15 
touchdowns in 10 games. Coulter transferred from Texas late in the summer and 
quickly became the catalyst of Rolling Hills' offense with his trademark 
cut-back runs. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Gerard (Serra) -- Chosen the Camino Real League Most Valuable Player, 
Gerard led the South Bay in rushing with 1,920 yards and 28 touchdowns in 275 
carries. The hard-running fullback saved his best for last, gaining 239 yards 
and scoring two TDs in the Division VII championship game. 
</P>
<P>
KICKER: 
</P>
<P>
Angel Andrade (Leuzinger) -- The area's second-leading kick scorer with 50 
points, Andrade converted nine of 13 field goals, including a long of 46 yards, 
and made 29 of 33 extra points. He also punted for the Olympians. 
</P>

CARSON HIGH'S B TEAM COACH GOES OUT A WINNER; 
</P>
<P>
PREPS: FINIS IRVIN COMPILED A REMARKABLE RECORD OF 173-12-1 IN 24 YEARS OF 
COACHING LOWER-DIVISION FOOTBALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN LINDSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a lower-division football coach at Carson High for 24 years, Finis Irvin did 
not have much time to work on his antique cars or take his wife, Marilee, out 
during the season. But now there will be time for both. He has decided to 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin is going out on top. He guided this year's B team to a 9-0 record. During 
his 10 years as head coach, Irvin compiled a record of 173-12-1 and the highest 
winning percentage (.848) of any football coach at Carson. His teams had six 
first-place and three second-place finishes in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Originally Irvin planned to retire after the 1988 season. But he told varsity 
Coach Gene Vollnogle that he could help out if needed. As it turned out, he 
was. So, Irvin reluctantly agreed to take the job for one last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I've enjoyed being a coach here, but it's to the point where I'm enjoying my 
free time more than the coaching," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin usually helped coach the varsity team during the playoffs but this year 
is different. Instead of coaching the expanded varsity roster, which includes 
the best B team players, he is making sure that the paper work is in order for 
his successor. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I'm sorting through the old equipment and deciding what can be kept 
and what I need to order for next year," he said. "I mean for the new coach, 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
Working with his hands has always held a fascination for Irvin. In the last few 
years he has added a room to his house, built a larger garage and poured a 
cement driveway. Coaching had been getting in the way of those projects. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing about coaching was all of the non-coaching duties that I had 
to oversee," he said. "There was the physical fitness programs that we had to 
run to get the players in shape; checking records to make sure that the kids 
were eligible to play. 
</P>
<P>
"From mid-August to the end of December, I work on these things. There just 
isn't any time to relax." 
</P>
<P>
Not having enough time to work on his antique cars was the final straw for 
Irvin. With a 1934 Ford truck and a 1924 Chevy waiting for him at home, 
something had to give. Coaching was that something. 
</P>
<P>
As a boy, he helped his father restore cars, starting a love affair that hasn't 
stopped. His father would work on the engines and Irvin would work on the body. 
Sanding it down and banging out the dents to make it look like a new car were 
the favorite parts of his job. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a '32 Ford when I was a kid and that was a great truck," he said. "I'm 
still kicking myself for giving that one up. It was just getting too hard to 
find parts for it." 
</P>
<P>
Irvin, 49, will continue to teach biology at Carson. Juggling his duties in the 
classroom and on the field proved too time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, he lined the field on game day, a chore that took three class 
periods to complete. Students in his biology classes were expected to study in 
the bleachers each Friday as Finis, dressed in Carson Colt sweat shirt and 
shorts, went about his work on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really going to miss the dedication he put in with the students in the 
program,"Vollnogle said. "He really cared about the students on the team." 
</P>
<P>
In 1956, at the age of 14, Irvin first started playing football at Banning 
High. Vollnogle was the coach of the varsity squad there. Irvin said that it 
was one of the happiest times of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first time that I've ever seen a coach treat his players like a 
human, and that really impressed me," Irvin said. 
</P>
<P>
That experience was the reason Irvin changed his major at Cal Poly Pomona from 
engineering to physical education, with a minor in biology. He iked what he saw 
in Vollnogle's technique and decided to make coaching part of his career. 
</P>
<P>
After three years of coaching at several private schools, Irvin got together 
with Vollnogle again at Carson High and has been there ever since. 
</P>
<P>
The best part of coaching, Irvin said, was being at the game and controlling 
it. Every week was like a final exam for him and he wanted to do his best. 
</P>
<P>
Teaching the players fundamentals is a large part of winning the game, and it's 
what he stressed. Irvin liked to work with the younger kids and give them the 
footing they needed to play well. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to give it everything if you want to play well," he said. "Sometimes 
we would get out to the practice field at 3 p.m. and we would still be out 
there after dark running the same play." 
</P>
<P>
Money was not important to Irvin. He said he made about $1,000 for 10 weeks of 
work, which, he figured, came out to about 27 cents an hour for all the time 
the job required. 
</P>
<P>
The winning tradition at Carson has helped attract a large and devoted coaching 
staff on all levels. Four of the coaches are teachers, but the seven others are 
walk-ons who used to play at Carson or want to be part of a winning program, 
Irvin said. 
</P>
<P>
Vollnogle, varsity coach since the school opened in 1963, will retire after the 
1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin enjoys a style of coaching that allows him be the father figure. The 
assistant coaches discipline the players while he stays calm and collected. The 
B team runs the same basic plays as the varsity, so the transition is smoother 
when the players move up. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing that I've tried to teach the coaches is that once you're done 
yelling at the player it's over and you don't hold a grudge," he said.

ALL-VALLEY FOOTBALL TEAMS

OFFENSIVE BACKS 
</P>
<P>
Few players have overcome the anonymity of playing at a small school as 
dramatically as has Derek Sparks, Montclair Prep's junior running back. 
Although he competed for a team that plays at the lowest level in the Southern 
Section, few questioned his credentials. Last season at perennial City Section 
power Banning, he was named the state's sophomore player of the year by Cal-Hi 
Sports. Sparks emerged as the Valley's most productive back this season. He was 
the leading rusher with 1,944 yards and the leading scorer with 210 points on 
35 touchdowns. His 32 rushing touchdowns tied him for sixth place on the 
all-time Southern Section list. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most courageous performance of the season was turned in by Canyon's 
senior tailback, Chris Peery, who underwent surgery on his groin the week 
before the first game of the season. But with Peery back at full speed by 
mid-season, he helped the Cowboys overcome a 1-3-1 start and sweep to their 
seventh Golden League title in eight years. Peery, an All-Valley selection two 
years ago, rushed for 1,220 yards and was third in the area with 27 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy Coach Bob Francola had little trouble with play selection this season: 
Just give the ball to Ontiwaun Carter. The junior running back flourished under 
a demanding workload, leading Valley City Section rushers with 1,563 yards in 
an area-high 252 carries, and he missed parts of two games because of a thigh 
injury. Carter rushed for 1,190 yards as a sophomore and he has a two-year 
total of 2,763. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany's drive to the Division I playoffs after a last-place Del Rey League 
finish last season was piloted by the area's leading passer, Joey Rosselli. The 
senior left-hander, who also pitches for the baseball team, passed for an 
area-high 2,402 yards, completing 169 of 288 passes (58.7%) with 17 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RECEIVERS 
</P>
<P>
Canyon averaged 336 yards a game to lead area schools with a diversified attack 
that featured more than just Chris Peery up the middle. The Cowboys gained more 
yardage through the air than on the ground (2,289 yards to 2,080), and most of 
the damage was done by Clint Beauer. The senior dominated the area receiving 
ranks, catching an area-high 75 passes for 1,235 yards, nearly 500 more yards 
than his closest pursuer. 
</P>
<P>
Hart regained the Foothill League title behind the area's most versatile 
player. Hart senior Howard Blackwell rushed for 1,217 yards and 24 touchdowns 
and also caught 44 passes for 777 yards and eight touchdowns. With 32 
touchdowns and 194 points, Blackwell trailed only Derek Sparks for the area 
scoring lead, averaging 16.1 points a game. Counting 15 punt returns for 252 
yards, Blackwell handled the ball 228 times for 2,246 yards, an average of 9.8 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
One of the key factors in Crespi's 7-4 season was the play of Christian Fauria, 
whose brother Quinn was an All-Valley selection last season. Christian 
bolstered Crespi's defense as a defensive end but is best remembered for his 
play at tight end. Fauria had 57 catches for 664 yards and six touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OFFENSIVE LINEMEN 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys, a longtime doormat, surged to the Mid-Valley League title without 
benefit of an outstanding skill-position player. Instead, the Wolves dominated 
opponents along the line of scrimmage. Nobody in the league played better on 
either side of the ball than Edvin Babayova, who shared the league MVP award. 
</P>
<P>
Tim DeGroote protected quarterback Rob Westervelt, opened holes for Howard 
Blackwell and was named to the All-Foothill League team. Coach Mike Herrington 
calls the junior the best center in the school's history. 
</P>
<P>
After more than four decades without a playoff victory, Notre Dame recorded two 
this season. Only Montclair Prep and Thousand Oaks rushed for more yards than 
the Knights, whose running backs more often than not followed John DiSante 
through gaping holes into the secondary. Like DeGroote, DiSante returns next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy Coach Bob Francola patiently endured the mistakes that John Jones 
committed last season as a junior lineman because he knew he had a major talent 
on his hands. Francola's patience paid dividends a year later and now Division 
I college coaches are waiting to reap the reward. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
KICKER 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's Frank Diana slugged it out in the trenches on the offensive and 
defensive lines but still managed to convert all 15 of his point-after attempts 
and four of five field-goal tries. Coach Steve Landress calls Diana, an 
All-City soccer selection last season, one of the school's best athletes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE BACKS 
</P>
<P>
Some have argued that the area's most valuable player in '89 is Sylmar's Jerome 
Casey. The senior rushed for 1,447 yards and caught 14 passes for 378 yards to 
account for 1,825 yards in total offense in just 10 games. Not bad numbers for 
the Valley Pac-8 Conference's best defensive player. As a defensive back, he 
led Sylmar with 70 solo tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills fielded the best defense among area City teams, allowing only 
157.9 yards a game. The Highlanders dominated offenses with the area's best 
defensive skill-position players. Leading the Granada Hills effort in the 
secondary were Leon Glasgow and Derrick Stewart. Glasgow shared the team lead 
in interceptions with three and also gained 471 yards in 94 carries and scored 
six touchdowns as a running back. Glasgow will be pursued by Division I 
recruiters, but the good news for Highlander fans is that Stewart is only a 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham missed the playoffs despite a 5-3-1 overall record but no blame can 
be directed toward Danny Larson. The senior quarterback-defensive back led area 
City passers, completing 118 of 231 (51.1%) for 1,445 yards with 12 touchdowns 
and eight interceptions. Larson, the Mid-Valley League co-Player of the Year, 
made as strong an impact in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Grant claimed honors as the area's most surprising team, sweeping to the East 
Valley League title. Although Grant featured balance, the show belonged to 
Marlowe Lewis, who shared the league's MVP award with Casey. As Grant's 
quarterback, Lewis rushed for 759 yards and passed for 805 more. But his future 
in college lies with his defensive prowess. 
</P>
<P>
No player made a bigger impression in the first week of the season than Notre 
Dame's Errol Small, who rushed for 213 yards in the Knights' opening win over 
Alemany. Small finished the season as the area's fourth-leading rusher (1,467 
yards) despite playing regularly as the Knights' best defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LINEBACKERS 
</P>
<P>
El Camino Real's stunning upset of Granada Hills in the City quarterfinals 
focused attention on one of the area's overlooked players. Senior Jamal 
Anderson anchored the Conquistadore defense and fueled the team's 
ground-oriented attack. Anderson punched enough holes in defenses to rush for 
1,153 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills' loss to El Camino Real also spoiled Brett Washington's bid for a 
number of school rushing records. The burly fullback, who also anchored the 
team's defense, rushed for 1,156 yards for a two-year total of 1,772. Luckily 
for him and Granada Hills, he returns next year. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando stumbled to a 5-6 record and lost in the first round of the City 
playoffs. But when the Tigers built a five-game win streak, they did it with 
defense. At the center of that effort was Vincent Hall, who also doubled as 
fullback. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEFENSIVE LINEMEN 
</P>
<P>
Taft lost many key players from last year's West Valley League championship 
team to graduation, but Gregory Bernard returned and led the Toreadors to a 
second consecutive title. He dominated on the line and shared the league's MVP 
award with Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
The accomplishments of Notre Dame's Owen Taylor mirrored those of Bernard. 
Taylor led Notre Dame to its second consecutive San Fernando Valley League 
title and was named the league's best lineman.

SUPERSONICS WANT A TROUBLE-FREE HOME

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hottest commodity in the NBA has a home with a leaky roof, a scoreboard 
that malfunctions because of power shortages and plumbing that backs up 
frequently. So the tenants pay attention when out-of-towners mention shiny new 
buildings, lucrative deals and relocation all in the same breath. 
</P>
<P>
A little more than a month into the season, the Seattle SuperSonics have almost 
as many suitors as victories. They come, apparently unsolicited, offering part 
or all income from parking and concessions and the possibility of luxury 
suites, none of which the team has now. They come offering a quality arena, 
which the Sonics don't have, either. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to tell the fans yelling at me that we just rent the building," team 
President Bob Whitsitt said of the Seattle Coliseum, the SuperSonics' home, 
sub-par excellence. "We would like to fix the leaks. We wish the scoreboard 
would work all the time. We wish the toilets wouldn't back up." 
</P>
<P>
So the SuperSonics listen to the proposals from Memphis, from Cincinnati, which 
would like to put a team just across the river in Kentucky; from Anaheim, San 
Diego, Toronto, Kansas City, Mo., Columbus, Ohio, and nearby Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
Team officials have worked for three years to get a new building. Owner Barry 
Ackerley bought seven acres next to the Kingdome to build his own arena, but 
the baseball Mariners balked because of traffic and parking problems when 
schedules run together in the spring. King County owns the dome. Guess who won 
the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Cynics might suggest that the SuperSonics are floating the rumors of outside 
interest to better their own deal at home, but everyone from Ackerley on down 
has made public statements about wanting to stay. 
</P>
<P>
But will they? 
</P>
<P>
Whitsitt, encouraged by the recent election of Mayor Norm Rice, who as a 
councilman seemed in favor of a new arena, stays clear of probabilities and 
percentages. He does, however, say that this is the season for a decision. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't just keep saying, 'Well, maybe next year it'll work out,' " Whitsitt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So they listen. 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics' lease runs through the 1994-95 season, but they could buy 
their way out for $1.5 million. The deadline for filing to move for 1990-91 is 
March, and a majority of the NBA's 27-member board of governors is needed for 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
Sympathy for the team runs deep. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner David Stern said recently: "I don't want to speak for the board of 
governors, but I do know most people in Seattle and around the league agree 
that vast improvements must be made." 
</P>
<P>
Built in 1962 for the World's Fair, Seattle Coliseum is the league's fifth 
oldest and, with a capacity of 14,250, third-smallest arena. And in the three 
years the SuperSonics have been trying to get a new arena, the place hasn't 
exactly aged gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
"They could have at least fixed the roof," Whitsitt said. 
</P>
<P>
It says a lot about the type of season New York's Patrick Ewing is having when 
people are talking nonstop about how much he has improved, after averaging 21.2 
points and 8.8 rebounds in his first four years. 
</P>
<P>
Some claim it's his shooting, impressive in itself considering that Ewing began 
the season shooting 53.1% during his career. Others point to his passing. 
Whatever. The one thing many seem to agree on is that Ewing, with Akeem 
Olajuwon's preseason setback after developing blood clots in his leg, has 
passed the Houston Rockets' three-time all-NBA selection and become the best 
center in the game. 
</P>

"It was definitely Akeem, and not just for one year," Laker Magic Johnson said. 
"It was Akeem the last three or four years. Now, it's definitely Patrick 
Ewing." 
</P>
<P>
So, maybe it doesn't matter if Olajuwon is healthy or not. 
</P>
<P>
"(Ewing) is just going out and kicking butt," said Seattle's Michael Cage. 
"It's that simple. And he plays like he has that attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Ewing has 32 points or more in seven games already, and in five recent outings 
he has scored 41, 29, 32, 32 and 26 points. Second in the league in scoring and 
blocked shots as of Saturday, at 29.3 and 3.42, respectively, he is shooting 
56% and averaging 9.8 rebounds. Teammate Charles Oakley is among the rebounding 
leaders with 12.3. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no sense in me even trying to describe how good he is," Knick guard 
Mark Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
Other reviews: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sacramento Coach Jerry Reynolds: "He was always a great defensive player 
and a very good offensive player. But he became a great offensive player. He 
shoots the ball almost as well as anyone from 15 to 18 feet." 
</P>
<P>
 -- New York forward Kenny Walker, a close friend: "Patrick always had a good 
work ethic. Every time I see him, he's more and more intimidating, and he 
spends more time before practices perfecting moves. I've never been around a 
guy this mentally tough to improve his game." 
</P>
<P>
Ewing gets all the exclamation points, but give an assist to Stu Jackson. After 
taking over for Rick Pitino as coach, Jackson shifted the emphasis from a 
wide-open, three-point-shooting attack to a more controlled half-court offense. 
Ewing became the centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
Be it ever so humble . . . 
</P>
<P>
Charles Barkley of the 76ers skipped the Dec. 5 game against the Knicks at 
Madison Square Garden with the flu. It was an especially disappointing trip to 
miss. 
</P>
<P>
"They're really into basketball," Barkley said. "I like playing in places where 
they're really into the game. So apparently, I don't like playing in Philly." 
</P>
<P>
When Blair Rasmussen, a center with an 8.8-point average, got $17.5 million for 
seven years from Denver, more than a few people were surprised. Bertram Lee and 
Peter Bynoe, the Nuggets' new owners, were among them. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, that deal got the Lee-Bynoe early days in the NBA off to a dubious 
start: 
</P>
<P>
 -- General Manager Pete Babcock signed the contract on behalf of the club. 
</P>
<P>
 -- President John Spoelstra, brought in over Babcock by Bynoe and Lee, was in 
on the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Majority owner Robert Wussler, who wants to maintain a low profile, was at 
least kept informed. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone apparently knew of the deal except Bynoe and Lee, who were busy 
completing the takeover from Sidney Shlenker. Spoelstra told Babcock and agent 
Herb Rudoy that he was keeping the new owners updated. Apparently he wasn't. 
Bynoe and Lee later asked Rudoy to cut the deal to $10 million for five years. 
</P>
<P>
"They tested me, I suppose, to see if I was born yesterday," Rudoy said. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, in its original form, was announced six days after it had been 
signed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the internal management of the team is something we can improve, 
something we will improve, something we must improve," Bynoe said. 
</P>
<P>
Big men need not apply: When Denver played Golden State Nov. 28, the lineup had 
a short-term approach, with none of the players on the court during one stretch 
taller than 6-feet-7. The Nuggets had 6-7 Bill Hanzlik, 6-3 Fat Lever, 6-4 Todd 
Lichti, 5-10 Eddie Hughes and 6-6 Walter Davis. The Warriors countered with 6-7 
Chris Mullin, 6-5 Mitch Richmond, 6-5 Sarunas Marciulionis, 6-2 Winston Garland 
and 6-foot Tim Hardaway.

IRVINE REJECTS LAGUNA LAUREL RELOCATION PLAN

City officials said "no thanks" to the Laguna Laurel project Wednesday, soundly 
rejecting a proposal to relocate the Irvine Co.'s controversial, 3,200-home 
planned community from pristine Laguna Canyon to their city. 
</P>
<P>
"I liken it to a garbage barge of a development in search of a port," Irvine 
Mayor Larry Agran said. "If those of us in Irvine are reluctant to provide one, 
that's understandable." 
</P>
<P>
The move dealt a stiff blow to Laguna Beach officials and environmentalists who 
have fought for more than a decade to keep the houses out of the hills and 
slopes that make up Laguna Canyon. Laguna officials had hoped that moving the 
development to Irvine would be a satisfactory solution all around. 
</P>
<P>
But after a closed meeting Wednesday with officials from Laguna Beach, Irvine 
Councilman Cameron Cosgrove emerged and said flatly: "Irvine is completely out 
of the picture as far as taking the development." 
</P>
<P>
So for Irvine Co. officials, it is back to the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that what it obviously means," said Larry Thomas, an Irvine Co. 
spokesman, "is that we need to sit back down with officials of Laguna Beach to 
determine if they have any other alternatives that would satisfy them that we 
could consider." 
</P>
<P>
Just weeks ago, the proposal to move the development from Laguna Canyon into 
Irvine was heralded as a major breakthrough for opponents of the 2,150-acre 
project, which would include a golf course, a shopping center and a school, in 
addition to the 3,000 or so homes. Now, all sides agree, Irvine is out of the 
picture and there are no counteroffers on the table. 
</P>
<P>
Yet opponents of the project played down the damage Wednesday, saying that the 
meeting was only another step in what is expected to be a lengthy negotiation 
process involving the two cities, the developer and the county. Pinning their 
hopes on an upcoming visit by Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif), Laguna Beach 
officials said they would explore the possibility of obtaining federal funds to 
purchase the canyon for open space. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you have to see this as part of the overall negotiations," said 
Elizabeth Brown, president of Laguna Greenbelt Inc., one of several 
environmental groups battling the project. "The Irvine Co. put some conditions 
on their offer that were impossible, and everyone knows they are impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"People come to the negotiating table with certain positions. . . . What is 
important is the sincerity with which everyone approaches the discussions and, 
at this point, I don't think any of the three parties is doing this just for 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
A Cranston aide in Washington said Wednesday that obtaining federal money to 
buy the canyon may be nearly impossible. Ten years ago, the senator introduced 
a $38-million bill that would have preserved the canyon area as part of a 
national park, but it died in committee. 
</P>
<P>
"There just hasn't been a lot of money in recent years in terms of land 
acquisition," said Cranston aide Kathy Lacey. "For the whole nation, the 
federal government only designated $68 million, so as you can see, it's not a 
top priority in the Administration's mind." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. officials who crafted the offer at the request of Laguna Beach 
expressed surprise at the outcome of Wednesday's meeting. "The only indication 
we had was that Laguna Beach Mayor Lida Lenney had expressed on several 
occasions that the city of Irvine would be more receptive then it has been," 
Irvine Co. spokesman Thomas said. "I would only say that we were surprised it 
was rejected out of hand with apparently no discussion." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas added that with the outcome of Wednesday's meeting, the company will not 
pursue the Irvine option. 
</P>
<P>
"Any alternative that would involve the city of Irvine would have to involve 
the elected leadership of that city," Thomas said. " . . . I think the door has 
been shut pretty firmly." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach officials, who had urged their Irvine counterparts to support the 
proposal, said that they had not been aware that Irvine planning regulations 
would effectively require voter approval of a development of Laguna Laurel's 
size. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed," Lenney said. "But I did not know before this meeting that 
the city of Irvine had a general plan amendment that has locked them in in such 
a way that they could not change without a vote of the people." 
</P>
<P>
About 16,000 acres of open space surrounds Irvine, including land in Bommer and 
Shady canyons on the southern edge of the community, which borders Laguna 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine officials have ruled out locating the project in any of those areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no place for 3,200 homes other than places currently set aside as open 
space, and there is no way we're going to give that up," Cosgrove said. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Irvine and Laguna Beach officials called for further 
discussions with the Irvine Co. and the county. "With the city of Irvine and 
the cooperation of the Irvine Co., they can bring the county to the table and 
there may be others that come in to help us, be they at the state level or in 
local jurisdictions," said Laguna Beach City Councilman Robert F. Gentry. "We 
all need to work together to preserve one of the most precious resources in 
California," he said, referring to Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, county officials, who have already granted tentative approval to the 
project, said that they have no plans to enter in the negotiations even though 
there is strong public interest in the issue. Protesters have doggedly picketed 
Irvine Co. chairman Donald Bren's home and a protest march through Laguna 
Canyon drew an estimated 7,000 people. Last month, protesters were gearing up 
to appear at a County Planning Commission meeting on the development when the 
Irvine Co. requested a sudden postponement so that it could negotiate further 
with Laguna Beach officials. 
</P>
<P>
"All of this energy should have been directed not only at the Irvine Co. but at 
the county before this thing became a reality," said Orange County Board of 
Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley. "I don't see any discussions. I would 
probably go to the City Council if I were invited, but I'm not sure what our 
participation would be at the present time."

NEWBORN BABY 'NOEL' DOING WELL AFTER SHE'S DISCOVERED IN GUTTER 
</P>

<P>
A newborn baby girl was found abandoned in a residential neighborhood Wednesday 
by a man who spotted the infant lying in a cardboard box in a street gutter. 
</P>
<P>
The child, who had been wrapped in two blue acrylic blankets, is in good 
condition at Samaritan Medical Center-San Clemente, and is being treated there 
for hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
She is white, has dark hair and dark eyes, is 19 inches long and weighs 5 
pounds, 10 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
Nurses at the hospital named the baby Noel in honor of the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
"She was cold and she was hungry," said Vicki Sweet, the hospital's director of 
emergency services. "As we warmed her up and gave her fluids, she started to 
fuss a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of Noel marks the fourth time this year -- and the third in the 
past two months -- that a newborn has been found abandoned in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The baby was found about 8:15 a.m. in the 100 block of Avenida Dolores, an 
older section of the city. A doctor at Samaritan gave Baby Noel the middle name 
Dolores in honor of the street. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whose identity was withheld, told police that he was picking up his 
morning newspaper when he saw the small cardboard box lying in a gutter about 
50 feet from his house, near the sixth green of San Clemente Municipal Golf 
Course. As he approached the box, he heard a baby's cry. And when he looked 
inside, he found the baby, with part of her umbilical cord still attached. The 
man then took the infant inside his house and telephoned police, said San 
Clemente police investigator Bart Massey. 
</P>
<P>
"The scary part is where the baby is found -- in a gutter," said San Clemente 
Fire Department spokesman Jack Stubbs. "This is not a doorstep delivery, which 
some of them are." 
</P>
<P>
When paramedics arrived at the scene, the baby was in stable condition. The 
baby fell asleep in the paramedics' truck on the way to the hospital, Stubbs 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Her temperature was a little low when she first came in," said hospital nurse 
Carol Harrison. "But now she's warm." The baby spent the afternoon sleeping 
comfortably in an incubator. 
</P>
<P>
"The baby is very, very good, doesn't cry much, eats well," said hospital 
spokeswoman Kathy McInerney. 
</P>
<P>
"Noel Dolores" was the talk of the day at the medical center. The infant 
attracted hospital staffers who gazed at her as she slept among about half a 
dozen other newborns in the maternity ward nursery. 
</P>
<P>
"She's so sweet, she's so beautiful," Sweet said. 
</P>
<P>
The baby will remain in an isolation nursery at the hospital for three days, 
and then be transferred to Orangewood Children's Home for abandoned or 
neglected youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Police so far have no leads, but a neighbor reported seeing a blue sedan 
driving slowly down the street about 15 minutes before the discovery. Massey, 
however, said that it is common for drivers to go slow in that area.

ARTS IMPRESARIO PAINTS TRACTS AS FUTURE 'TRASH'

<P>
The talk was hardly the type normally heard in the boardroom of the Hon 
Development Co., but then Peter Sellars, the impish arts impresario with the 
punk haircut, had never attended one of its executive sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing the powerful development company's top brass, Sellars, known for his 
ability to shock, predicted that in as few as five years, housing tracts like 
those blanketing much of modern suburbia would amount to "just trash, just 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
People who inhabit the "usual uninteresting series of tract homes . . . have 
some sort of strange blankness in their lives," he told executives of Hon and 
Foothill Ranch Co., its subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
"The bad side of the American suburban existence," continued the nationally 
recognized stage director of highly unorthodox theater and opera productions, 
"is alcoholism and loneliness because the basic suburban daydream is to wall 
yourself up in your castle and then there's nothing between you and your liquor 
cabinet." 
</P>
<P>
Hon and Foothill, however, are creating an unusual master-planned community in 
Saddleback Valley that, if all goes as intended, will teem with public artworks 
and offer performing arts festivals. Sellars, director of the 1990 Los Angeles 
Festival of the arts, was invited to Hon's office here Wednesday to give his 
advice as details of the project are being ironed out. 
</P>
<P>
And, by all accounts, he made a hit. 
</P>
<P>
"L.A. is blessed to have you," said Gerald E. Buck, Hon executive vice 
president. And Sellars had nothing but praise for what Hon is endeavoring to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill Ranch, the company's $2-billion, 2,700-acre planned community to be 
developed over the next 10 to 15 years in South County, is expected to include 
3,900 housing units, commercial and industrial development, a 1,100-acre park, 
a fire station, a library and schools. 
</P>
<P>
Hon also wants to make art a part of daily life at the urban village with the 
Foothill Ranch Urban Arts Program. Through fees the company is charging most 
builders of the community's homes and businesses, several millions of dollars 
will be generated for up to 200 public artworks to be sprinkled throughout the 
development, and for arts education and live festivals. 
</P>
<P>
The arts program is particularly unusual, perhaps unique in California, a state 
public art expert has said, because its fees-for-art are being imposed by Hon, 
a private developer, rather than a government agency, which is typically the 
case. Hon, developing some of the land itself, will also contribute funds for 
art. 
</P>
<P>
"Wow," said Sellars, 32, gazing at a map of Foothill Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"Congratulations," he told Buck, an art collector who had the idea for the art 
program. "A lot of people have thought very well of this." 
</P>
<P>
Hon's effort to work against the cookie-cutter style of planned communities to 
"give a place character is tremendous," Sellars said. "This (is) one way to 
combat the image of this area as a wasteland." 
</P>
<P>
Sellars, an iconoclast who is highly regarded in the arts community, 
nonetheless had plenty of suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
To create a strong sense of community -- instead of the isolated, alienating 
life style of much of suburbia -- Sellars said Hon should commission artworks 
that make people interact: "Art that's hard to understand, that's confused and 
that generates passion and controversy so a discussion goes on and you move 
beyond the passivity that's indicative of most developments." 
</P>
<P>
Interaction with non-Western cultures is another road to vital community life, 
said Sellars, who has vowed to include only arts from countries that "touch the 
Pacific" and have "no European works at all" in next September's 
multidisciplinary Los Angeles Festival. "We need to rub shoulders with people 
different from ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Many recent immigrants to Orange County, particularly from Southeast Asia and 
Latin America, are "master artists unfortunately working as maids and chefs," 
he said. Integrating them into the community and employing them as artists 
would "make a tremendous difference in the quality of everyone's life and give 
a sense of justice to people in their new-found country." 
</P>
<P>
Architecture that is designed collaboratively with artists -- a plan Hon 
already has in mind -- will ensure the worth and longevity of Foothill Ranch, 
Sellars also said. 
</P>
<P>
"Involve craftsmen and artists in every dimension of the building plans so that 
art is inseparable from what is finally made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the lasting cultural presence of Florence, Italy, and other great 
European cities, he asked: "One hundred years from now, in 10 years, in five 
years, what are these tract developments going to be? Just trash, just 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
While three residential developers of Foothill Ranch have already agreed to pay 
several hundred thousand dollars in art fees, Buck said after Sellars' talk 
that he is "stumped" on how to persuade them to build more individualistic 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
By way of solution, Sellars said: "You have to appeal to the businessman not 
just as a businessman, but as a human being, and ask them, 'Do you realize what 
you're bringing into the world and do you care about it?' "

<P>
About 15 state employees picketed outside the Fairview Developmental Center on 
Wednesday to protest what they consider inadequate staffing levels at the 
state's seven facilities that house developmentally disabled patients. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the California Assn. of Psychiatric Technicians, which represents 
more than 750 employees at the Fairview center, the protest was the third in a 
series of demonstrations aimed at increasing public awareness of what the group 
calls a "serious health problem." 
</P>
<P>
"We deal with very delicate clients that need intense supervision and care," 
said Jay Salter, president of the state association. "We are unable to give 
that kind of care because there just aren't enough bodies to do so." 
</P>
<P>
The association members complain that they are routinely forced to supervise as 
many as 14 clients -- and sometimes more -- at a time by themselves, and often 
work 12- to 16-hour days because of state budget cuts that drastically reduced 
the number of technicians at each center and allowed vacant technician 
positions to remain unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
The association also stressed that its complaints were directed toward "Gov. 
Deukmejian and the state Department of Finance and not the Fairview 
administration." 
</P>
<P>
"We are certainly in agreement with their stand," said Bamford Frankland, 
deputy director of the state Department of Developmental Services. "The state's 
budget cuts have left us with an extremely tight situation that we hope will be 
corrected with the new fiscal year." 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) and Assemblyman Nolan Frizzelle 
(R-Huntington Beach) were invited to the protest but did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the state laid off 400 temporary workers at developmental 
centers, 80 of whom worked at Fairview. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked at Fairview for about 12 years and have witnessed the steady 
decline in the amount of care and attention we are able to give," said 
psychiatric technician Paul Jacobs of Orange. Jacobs said he fears being 
injured while working alone with the patients. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when I am alone and have to lift a client that weighs more 
than I do," Jacobs said. "It is reasonable for two people to do it for the 
worker's safety and the client's. . . . There are many injuries that result 
from that type of thing or from when clients fight with one another and you 
have to break it up by yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about patient care have been fueled by recent state investigations 
into several patient deaths attributed to negligence at the developmental 
centers. The last of 14 statewide public hearings on the state's care of the 
mentally retarded is scheduled for Feb. 23 in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
Several incidents in which patients were left unattended at the Fairview center 
were detailed in a report by the state Department of Health Services licensing 
and certification division after a recent inspection. The center was also 
criticized for its lack of programs geared toward teaching the patients 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
Fairview employees say cutbacks resulted in the discontinuance of many programs 
that were meant to teach patients how to better care for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of these problems, we really aren't able to give them what they need," 
Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
The association plans to hold protests at each of the seven development centers 
and will demonstrate next in Porterville in Tulare County. ALLISON SAMUELS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: 10 MORE MALATHION SPRAYINGS POSSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the second malathion spraying in county history successfully behind them, 
county agricultural officials are now awaiting word from the state on a 
schedule for perhaps as many as 10 more dousings in North County. 
</P>
<P>
About 11:15 p.m. Tuesday, three specially equipped helicopters finished 
spraying hundreds of gallons of pesticide mix over about a nine-square-mile 
area of Orange County that included parts of La Habra, Brea and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural officials now plan to spray that same area, around the site where 
a pregnant Mediterranean fruit fly was trapped Nov. 17 in a Brea guava tree, as 
many as a dozen times in all to try and halt the spread of the crop-destroying 
pest. 
</P>
<P>
The aggressive new spraying policy has caused rumblings among some North County 
residents, who question assertions by agricultural officials that the malathion 
mix poses no health risks. 
</P>
<P>
But most elected officials in the affected area have voiced support for the 
multi-dose approach and, unlike Los Angeles County, no formal opposition has 
developed here. 
</P>
<P>
Under a preliminary schedule prepared Wednesday by state officials, the North 
County area, unlike some other Medfly-infested regions around the Southland, 
will not be re-sprayed until the beginning of January at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
But local officials are still awaiting word from the state on sprayings for 
January and beyond. That may come within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The North County area will likely be sprayed once every three weeks in the 
winter, with the aerial applications coming more frequently as the weather 
warms in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Agricultural Commissioner James Harnett said residents in the 
target areas will be mailed notices for future sprayings. That was not done for 
Tuesday's application, causing some confusion among residents who weren't sure 
when or whether their homes would be sprayed. 
</P>
<P>
But Harnett nonetheless defended the decision not to put out notices for the 
Tuesday event, saying that: "You would have to have your radio off and not read 
the paper to be totally surprised by the spraying." ERIC LICHTBLAU

SANTA DEBATE FINDS PROFS POLES APART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Claus works at the North Pole to avoid taxes and regulations, delivers 
his toys in the dark of night to elude Customs agents and is a master of the 
free enterprise system, a college professor jokingly asserted Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
His management style "would make the Japanese blush with envy," declared Don 
Booth, professor of economics at Chapman College during a mock college debate 
on the topic, "Santa Claus: Entrepreneurial Genius or Capitalistic Spy?" 
</P>
<P>
On the Santa-as-spy side: "Haven't you ever wondered how Santa flies around 
without setting off Russian radar?" queried Robert Slayton, a history professor 
at the college. In fact, he alleged, St. Nick's "Stealth Sled" is little more 
than a spy plane financed by the U.S. Department of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Slayton argued, the image of Santa as a kind and gentle 
philanthropist is bunk. 
</P>
<P>
The jolly man in the red suit exploits his workers and discriminates against 
children with different religious or ethnic backgrounds, Slayton told about 60 
students who attended the debate. 
</P>
<P>
Through extensive research, Slayton said, he discovered that Santa operates a 
sweatshop type of organization, where workers toil many hours for scant wages 
and minimal benefits until they are very old with long white beards. "The 
working conditions are terrible!" he shouted. 
</P>
<P>
Slayton argued that by giving his loot to some children and not others, Santa 
discriminates against those with different beliefs and cultures. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa has corrupted Christmas, made it the symbol of class warfare," he said. 
"Moral values have been replaced by materialism and the slogan has changed from 
'Good will to all,' to 'What did you get?' " 
</P>
<P>
But Booth was unswayed by his colleague's presentation. Santa "should be 
revered as a creative, rugged individual" and a role model for business 
executives worldwide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa's entrepreneurial success can be traced to his management style, Booth 
explained. "Working for Santa is such a pleasure that most people do not ask 
for any salary other than the joy they bring to others." MATT LAIT

FUNDS ALLOCATED FOR CARE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council, working to keep a Chapman College day-care center open, voted 
to allocate $30,000 to help relocate the center to a site properly zoned for a 
child-care facility. 
</P>
<P>
School officials had planned to close the center Friday because it is in a 
residential area not zoned for it. Relocation costs made it prohibitive for the 
college to move the center, which can serve 30 children. 
</P>
<P>
"With this vote and show of support from the city, I can now rescind my 
decision to close the center," Chapman College President Allen E. Koenig said. 
"I am most appreciative of the outpouring of support for the center by faculty, 
students, neighbors and members of the Orange City Council." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Smoller, associate professor of political science and parent of a child 
served by the center, led the fight to keep the center open. After the vote he 
said: "I'm happy . . . this is one of those political decisions in which 
everyone is going to win. It represents a new spirit of cooperation between the 
college and the surrounding community." 
</P>
<P>
Acting as the Redevelopment Agency, the council allocated the $30,000 so that 
the Child Study Center could move from its current location at 485 and 489 N. 
Center St. to a new campus site at 525 N. Center. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the city funds, the center received $5,000 from the Orangewood 
Children's Foundation and $1,000 from Chapman College Town and Gown, plus 
$10,000 worth of carpet, cement, tile and other such gifts from parents and 
local businesses. MATT LAIT

FIRE-SPRINKLER LAW PASSED BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A law requiring sprinklers to be installed in new buildings was passed this 
week by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Under the local ordinance, approved unanimously by the council, all new homes, 
apartments and commercial buildings must have fire sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ingrid McGuire expressed reservations over the law, saying that 
the sprinklers would drive up the price of a new home by $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I am somewhat concerned that the additional requirements . . . will make it 
more difficult for people to buy new housing," McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
The city had received a letter from the Orange County Building Industry Assn. 
urging that the law be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
The sprinklers are "probably not popular with developers," said Councilwoman 
Judy Curreri, "but we have a responsibility to do things that are helpful to 
the quality of life." FRANK MESSINA

TEACHERS PICKET IN CONTRACT DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY MARCANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ocean View School District teachers picketed Harbour View Elementary School on 
Wednesday over stalled contract talks and threatened to expand the picketing to 
other schools. 
</P>
<P>
Union representative Dane Shepard said the main issue in the dispute is the 
distribution of state funds under Proposition 98, which requires the state to 
allocate a percentage of its annual budget for schools. 
</P>
<P>
The district, which receives $59 per student in Proposition 98 funds, has 
offered each school $12 per student, Supt. Monte McMurray said. The remaining 
$47 per student "is on the table for salary increases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Shepard contended that the district has other sources for salary increases 
and should give the entire $59 per student to schools for classroom use. 
</P>
<P>
"We want that (Proposition 98) money to go directly to the classroom," Shepard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The union has also asked the district to increase its annual contribution to 
the teachers' health and welfare plan by about $900 per teacher, to a total of 
roughly $4,300 per teacher. The district is offering $375 a year more per 
teacher, McMurray said. 
</P>
<P>
Shepard said teachers "are actually getting a salary reduction because they 
have to pay out of pocket" for medical coverage, Shepard said. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides are scheduled to present their cases before a state mediator on Jan. 
11, Shepard said. TONY MARCANO

PARRISH SIGNS FOR 3 YEARS WITH ANGELS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: FREE AGENT CATCHER, 33, DECIDES TO REMAIN IN ANAHEIM WITH A CONTRACT 
WORTH $6.75 MILLION. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After taking a new look at his options, Lance Parrish decided the view is best 
right where he is. 
</P>
<P>
Parrish, who was granted "new look" free agency last month as an offshoot of 
baseball's second collusion case, signed a three-year deal with the Angels 
Wednesday worth $6.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old catcher, who was the foundation of the pitching staff's 
outstanding performance last season, earned a base salary of $1 million for 
1989 and added $210,000 in bonuses. He hit .238 in 124 games with 17 home runs 
and 50 RBIs, and his .993 fielding percentage was tops among catchers who 
played more than 95 games. 
</P>
<P>
Under his new contract, Parrish will receive a $500,000 signing bonus, a salary 
of $1.75 million in 1990, $2.25 million in 1991 and $2.25 million in 1992. He 
may have undermined his leverage by publicly saying he wanted to stay with the 
Angels, but he knew he wouldn't have been as happy anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I hurt my own case, but I wasn't too concerned about that," said 
Parrish, who waived his right to free agency when the Angels acquired him from 
Philadelphia in October, 1988, but was awarded another chance by arbitrator 
George Nicolau. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the Angels treated me very fairly. I never was concerned about cutting 
myself short. They realized I could talk to other clubs. Some clubs had shown 
interest in me early, but the Angels were very earnest in their decision to 
talk with me and get it done." 
</P>
<P>
Had his batting average not faded late last season -- he hit less than .190 
after Aug. 5 with only two home runs -- Parrish might have done even better 
financially; his contract is not among baseball's top 10 in average annual 
value. But Parrish, who attributed the decline to injuries he suffered in a 
collision with Milwaukee's Glenn Braggs, has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very fortunate the way things turned out," said Parrish, who graduated 
from Walnut High School and lives in Yorba Linda. "Guys that are coming off 
real, real good years are going to get big money, guys like Mark Langston and 
Kirby Puckett, and if I would have had the kind of year I feel I'm capable of, 
maybe I would have gotten more. But I have no complaints." 
</P>
<P>
Nor do the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a leader, and once you mention the word leader, that says it all," said 
Dan O'Brien, the club's senior vice president of baseball operations and the 
chief negotiator in the final stages of the deal. "The tempo and the concept of 
the game revolves around the catcher, and Parrish is a real leader for us 
there." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien said the Angels never feared losing Parrish, but were "concerned" about 
keeping him happy. "We wanted him to stay and he wanted to stay, and that makes 
it a little easier," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
The status of another prominent free agent, American League most valuable 
player Robin Yount, remains unchanged. General Manager Mike Port said he has 
not spoken with the Brewers' center fielder for nearly two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It was left on the basis that Robin has some decisions to make and we're not 
inclined to be intrusive," Port said. "It's not the type of situation where 
you're going to change his emotions." 
</P>
<P>
Port repeated that the Angels have not made Yount an offer and scoffed at a 
report in last week's New York Post that quoted an unidentified scout as saying 
the Angels had proposed a $27-million package that included a $5-million 
signing bonus and a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
A county circuit judge in Milwaukee is hoping Yount will give more weight to 
sentiment than money: a plea to the city's children by judge Charles Schudson 
has resulted in 6,000 letters from youngsters urging Yount to remain with the 
Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
Team president Bud Selig said Monday that he did not expect a decision from 
Yount this week.

<P>
Organized confusion reigns in the El Dorado High School gymnasium on a recent 
afternoon. The 32-team, two-day El Dorado wrestling tournament is in full 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
Wrestlers of all shapes and sizes crowd the bleachers, awaiting their matches. 
Others are in action on the six mats that cover the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Coaches holler encouragement from the sidelines in a strange language. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK. Rotate. Now." 
</P>
<P>
 "Slide, you've got nothing to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 After the matches the coaches spend a moment or two with their wrestlers, 
giving praise to the winners and offering consolation to the losers. 
</P>
<P>
Then it's off to another mat to watch another wrestler, in another weight 
division, compete. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Werschke, Katella High School coach, is in the midst of all of this, 
shouting, praising and encouraging just as he has since 1972, when he first 
started to coach wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
And -- as he sits against one wall intently watching one of his charges -- in 
the back of his mind he wonders how he can possibly leave it all behind. 
</P>
<P>
He has tried twice and has been unsuccessful twice. 
</P>
<P>
Werschke, 44, announced his retirement in 1986, saying he wanted to devote more 
time to teaching math and to his family. 
</P>
<P>
But the administration at Katella couldn't find a suitable replacement for the 
following season and wondered if Werschke couldn't, possibly, maybe, see if he 
might come back to coach the team again, lest it disband for lack of a 
qualified coach. 
</P>
<P>
So Werschke agreed to return. 
</P>
<P>
He coached two more seasons, watched the Knights win the competitive Empire 
League championship, and saw two of his wrestlers -- Chris Mollkoy and Joe 
Pastorello -- win state championships last season. 
</P>
<P>
Then he decided it was as good a time as any to retire again. 
</P>
<P>
The administration came calling again, wondering if, gee, well, you know, could 
he possibly do it one more season? Again they couldn't find a replacement and 
rather than have the program fall apart, couldn't he continue to coach? 
</P>
<P>
Werschke said yes, but that this was it. And so it is. Werschke will quit after 
this season is over, suitable replacement or not. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll miss the kids," he said. "I'll miss the closeness with the wrestlers." 
</P>
<P>
Quitting has been a difficult decision, to be sure. After the administration 
asked Werschke back the second time, he called all 60 wrestlers in the Knights' 
program and asked how important wrestling was to them. All 60 said it figured 
highly in their plans. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't stay away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for him to say no to those kids," said Marianne Werschke, his wife. 
"Wrestling is not in his blood. The kids are. When it comes down to it, he's 
afraid the program won't be there for the kids if he's not there." 
</P>
<P>
Werschke wrestled in high school in his native Colorado, earning third place at 
the state tournament in the 127-pound weight class his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball was the sport he enjoyed coaching most. He only started coaching 
wrestling when his sons, Scott, 25, and Keith, 21, began wrestling as 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
He spent the first seven seasons as an assistant, then became the head coach 10 
years ago. In that time, Katella has won two Empire League championships. And 
in that time, he has been consumed by wrestling and by his wrestlers. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't have to take notes on each wrestler's match, spend a moment with 
them explaining what he has written and ask them to read the notes again for 
discussion later, but he does. 
</P>
<P>
It's the little things, important though they may be, that add up. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't very many shortcuts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the El Dorado tournament, Werschke was in constant motion, moving from mat 
to mat watching his wrestlers perform. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he caught a break. No Katella wrestler was scheduled to be in action 
for several minutes. And yet he still needed to watch a particular match. 
</P>
<P>
"My son Scott is the referee in this match," he told a visitor before settling 
in to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the wrestlers he coaches, Werschke did not offer a critique of Scott's 
performance. At least, not immediately. 
</P>
<P>
At times, such a hectic schedule has been a burden. And that's the primary 
reason Werschke plans to quit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to spend more time working on my profession (teaching calculus and 
algebra)," Werschke said. "I think I could do without staying inside a gym all 
weekend at a tournament." 
</P>
<P>
From now until early March, though, Werschke will spend countless hours in 
gyms. He's back for one final season, and Katella's got him.

RAMS DIG DEEP FOR DEFENSIVE LINE HELP; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: BRIAN SMITH, A ROOKIE LINEBACKER WHO WAS ON THE INJURED RESERVE 
LIST FOR SEASONING, WILL START AT RIGHT END AGAINST THE JETS SUNDAY.

<P>
The Rams are so desperate on the defensive line, they're not above reaching 
into cold storage for help. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Smith, the team's second-round choice from Auburn, was a nice little 
project on the back-burner, a lanky linebacker with a considerable future and 
wing span. The Rams drafted him last April, potted him, watered him, and hoped 
he'd someday grow into a National Football League player. 
</P>
<P>
Next Sunday wasn't what the team had in mind, but here comes Brian Smith, roots 
and all. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries to three defensive ends have forced the Rams to alter their long-term 
forecast, so much so that Smith will start at right defensive end against the 
New York Jets in the team's 3-4 alignment. He's the fourth starter at the 
position this season, following Shawn Miller (moved to left end after Doug 
Reed's ankle sprain), Mike Piel (dislocated elbow) and Bill Hawkins (partially 
torn knee ligament). 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't Smith a linebacker? That was last month. Desperate times warrant 
desperate measures. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes they say that's the best way to learn, if they just throw you right 
into the fire," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith played some defensive line in college, but it's a long way from Auburn to 
the NFL, especially when you're playing out of position. 
</P>
<P>
Smith spent the first 13 weeks on injured reserve with a wrist injury, a polite 
way of letting everyone know that he needed more seasoning. 
</P>
<P>
He checked into training camp at 6-feet-6 and 240 pounds, and the Rams pointed 
him to the cafeteria. The team says it was thinking of Smith as a defensive end 
all along, only they never got around to telling him. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, there was no indication," he said. "I was just going along during my 
time out, and Coach (John) Robinson kept telling me: 'Just get bigger, stronger 
and faster.' And that's what I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
Smith now weighs 265 pounds, a 25-pound increase since the summer. At least now 
he looks the part. But can he play the part? 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it's just getting out there and playing for a change," he said. "I've 
got a lot to learn, and I'm working overtime to learn everything." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Rams are in a playoff chase, which normally isn't the best time 
to break new players into the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
But they're out of options. Wednesday, the Rams worked out Sean Smith, an 
unemployed defensive tackle and former fourth-round choice of the Chicago 
Bears. All measures now are stop-gap. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said the team might activate linebacker Mark Messner off the 
developmental squad and play him at nose-backer in the Eagle defense or on the 
line as a stunting tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Messner is one of those "tweeners" -- players who don't fit in well at 
linebacker or lineman when you feed his numbers (6-feet-2, 255 pounds) into the 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
"But he drives us crazy on the field," Robinson said, complimenting Messner's 
instinctive abilities. "But you've got to move him. Moving, he's dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
As for Smith, the future is now. The Rams have been impressed with his growth 
during his injured reserve hibernation. By growth here, they mean weight. 
</P>
<P>
"He's gotten huge compared to what he was," defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur 
said. "He was a skinny kid when he got here." 
</P>
<P>
Now he's an NFL starter, if only a few years ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Someone wondered Wednesday whether John Taylor's touchdown receptions of 95 and 
92 yards against the Rams last Monday night were the result of poor defense or 
great individual effort by the San Francisco receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson explained: "If I'm running over to the refrigerator to get the last 
Coke and you try to tackle me, and you miss, and I get the Coke, is that bad 
tackling or did I make a great run for the Coke? I don't know. From our 
standpoint, we didn't tackle very good. If I was Taylor's agent, I'd say it was 
a brilliant run." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The team won't make a roster move on Bill Hawkins until Friday, when they can 
better determine how long he'll be out with the knee injury suffered in Monday 
night's loss. "No one quite knows whether his injury is a two-week injury or a 
two-month injury," Coach John Robinson said. If Hawkins could be available by 
the second round of the playoffs, assuming the Rams make it that far, the Rams 
would keep him on the roster, Robinson said. If not, Hawkins will go on injured 
reserve. . . . Some final words on Robinson's fake field goal call against San 
Francisco: "It's the first great call I've ever made that failed," Robinson 
said. . . . This week's opponent, the New York Jets, are in serious trouble on 
and off the field. Neither of the team's top quarterbacks, Ken O'Brien or Pat 
Ryan, practiced Wednesday. O'Brien, the starter, has a sore elbow and won't 
throw this week, Coach Joe Walton said. Ryan, the backup, suffered a concussion 
in Sunday's loss to Pittsburgh. "(Tony) Eason's the only healthy quarterback 
we've got," Walton said. . . . Off the field, Walton's job seems in serious 
jeopardy now that the team has publicly announced it is actively trying to hire 
New England Patriots' General Manager Dick Steinberg to run the Jets' front 
office. Walton said Wednesday he wasn't bothered by the speculation. "To the 
contrary," he said. "I'm not concerning myself at all about it."

<P>
HERDMAN BRUSHES UP ON HIS ATTITUDE THIS SEASON 
</P>

Jeff Herdman is, at the moment, leading UC Irvine's basketball team with an 
average of 15.8 points a game. He's also, at the moment, one of the few Irvine 
players complimented by Coach Bill Mulligan on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
With all this going for him, you would expect a happy Herdman, right? 
</P>
<P>
Not when Irvine (1-5 overall) is off to the worst start in the school's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
ever 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, Irvine lost to Colorado, 98-83, at Boulder. Herdman scored 20 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now is not a good time to talk to me," Herdman said Tuesday. "I was 
looking forward to this year. I thought we would do better. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think everyone is playing hard right now. . . . I think that everyone 
on this team wants to win, but I think they need to play harder." 
</P>
<P>
Tenacious play, in all areas of the game, has been Herdman's specialty this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I like Jeff Herdman a lot because he plays so hard," Mulligan said. "But 
sometimes, he can be a real pain. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Herdman, a 6-foot-6, 200-pound junior forward, did not start in Irvine's first 
exhibition game this season -- against High Five America -- because, Mulligan 
said, he was not coming to practice with cooperation on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"He had his own game plan -- the Jeff Herdman plan," Mulligan said. "He wasn't 
gonna run the offense; he was gonna run the Jeff." 
</P>
<P>
Although Mulligan used one of his favorite weapons -- loud, harsh and continual 
criticism -- to try to sway Herdman, it didn't seem to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I just let it go in one ear and out the other," Herdman said. "I don't really 
listen to what he says anyway. . . . I play for myself." 
</P>
<P>
Said Mulligan: "I went after him so bad, I was almost amazed that he didn't 
quit. I mean, he didn't pout or back off. It was like I was talking to the 
wall. He was not intimidated one bit. His reaction was, 'I'll show you.' " 
</P>
<P>
In the season opener, a 79-71 loss to the University of San Francisco, Herdman 
scored a team-high 21 points. He is the only Anteater to score in double 
figures in every game this season. 
</P>
<P>
Although Herdman was more of a shooter last year -- he led the nation in 
three-point field goal percentage (60.6%) in February and finished the season 
ninth nationally (51.2%) -- he has expanded his role. 
</P>
<P>
"(Last year), if they stopped my shooting, they stopped my game," Herdman said. 
"Now I'm a much better offensive rebounder. . . . Rebounding's just attitude. 
If you want to rebound, you can." 
</P>
<P>
Herdman's attitude -- some would call it intense or aggressive, others would 
just call it an attitude -- is one that has given him something of a fearless 
demeanor on the court. 
</P>
<P>
"My attitude is, I don't back down to anyone," he said. "I've been like that 
all along." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Herdman scored a career-high 29 points to lead Irvine to an 82-79 
victory at Fresno State. It was the first victory in 12 tries for Irvine at 
Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the only big-time shooter I ever had to go into Fresno and just dominate 
the game," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Herdman said he hopes such performances become more commonplace, but mostly, he 
hopes his shooting -- he's 41.3% from the field, 40.9% from three-point range 
-- gains some consistency. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I want to win," Herdman said. "That's what motivates me. That's what I want." 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan on the team's poor start: "We're struggling. That's obvious. I'm very 
frustrated, the players are very frustrated. Somehow we'll pull it together. . 
. . I'm sorry we're not playing better. I'm embarrassed. . . . It's the 
coaches' fault. I don't want to lay it on the kids. We need a win. We need a 
win so everyone can hug each other again." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Patton, Anteater men's tennis coach, has been asked if he would be 
interested in coaching a new professional tennis team starting in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Chip Powers, spokesman for Domino's Team Tennis, said arrangements are in the 
works to secure a host site in Newport Beach, possibly at the Newport Beach 
Tennis Club. A formal decision will be announced by Domino's Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The teams play a very short season, from July 10 through Aug. 11, so, Powers 
said, a college coach could easily continue his duties along with the Domino's 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"They just asked if I was interested, that's it," Patton said. "I said I would 
be interested." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the men's tennis team will be playing across the country during the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
All-American Trevor Kronemann, ranked fourth in the nation at singles, will 
play in the Citrus Bowl tournament at Orlando, Fla. Dec. 26. Other Irvine 
players are playing at Milwaukee, Palm Springs and Scottsdale, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Said Patton: "It's kind of like, I'm the Pope and I'm sending my missionaries 
around the country . . . This is kind of a full-scale national attack." 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
The women's basketball team (1-4) travels to Pepperdine for a nonconference 
game at 7:30 tonight, then to the University of San Francisco for a game 
Sunday. Jenny Lee is averaging 9.2 points a game to lead Irvine. . . . Senior 
All-American Brian Pajer qualified for the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
swimming championships in the 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 55.56 
seconds at the Cerritos Invitational last weekend. The Irvine men's and women's 
teams won titles at the three-day event.

REGIONAL ADVERTISING, MARKETING WORK SHIFTED TO IN-HOUSE BY CARL KARCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carl Karcher Enterprises has moved its regional advertising and marketing 
business in-house, a company spokeswoman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Parks, a spokeswoman for the Anaheim-based burger chain, said the 
decision resulted from an expansion of Karcher Enterprises that included a 
marketing department. Those marketing managers found themselves duplicating the 
efforts of the outside advertising agency, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The ad firm that has handled the Carl's account for 4 1/2 years -- New 
York-based Della Femina, McNamee WCRS -- will continue do the company's 
strategic planning, its marketing research and develop all of its TV and radio 
advertising and in-store materials, said Joseph Olin, a vice president with 
Della Femina in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of Carl's decision to handle regional marketing, Della Femina has 
laid off half of its 14 employees who worked on the $20-million account. "But 
we're still handling the company's business on a systemwide, brand and regional 
basis," Olin said. 
</P>
<P>
For the first three quarters of fiscal 1990, ended Nov. 6, Karcher Enterprises' 
net income has declined 13% to $14.5 million from $16.6 million for the 
comparable period last year. The company has blamed the lower net income on a 
decline in investment income and an increase in interest expense. 
</P>
<P>
Bringing the regional advertising business in-house, Parks said, "was a 
management decision to manage the costs of the agency more effectively." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Karcher Enterprises nor Della Femina would comment on how much the 
hamburger chain will save by taking over the regional advertising and marketing 
work. Compiled by Mary Ann Galante, Times staff writer

FEWER BOSSES ARE PRESENTING THEIR EMPLOYEES WITH YEAR-END BONUSES; 
</P>
<P>
PAY: THE TREND IS TO SUBSTITUTE INCENTIVE-BASED PLANS FOR THE TRADITIONAL 
AUTOMATIC CHECK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Performance-based considerations are increasingly taking the place of year-end 
bonuses as employers across the United States decide who's been naughty or nice 
at holiday time. 
</P>
<P>
Although a boss who substitutes an incentive program for the traditional 
holiday bonus risks being called a Scrooge, the trend actually reflects the 
Santa Claus principle of rewarding good -- i.e., productive, behavior -- says 
consultant Paul Muller. 
</P>
<P>
"Bonuses, like salary, are no longer being treated as an entitlement," said 
Muller, director of Midwest compensation consulting for Ernst &amp; Young, a 
New York-based consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
And Orange County employers are no exception. An informal survey this week of 
many of the county's largest employers -- and also of some of the smaller ones 
-- finds that holiday bonuses here are most likely to be in the shape of 
turkeys or in the form of a week off with pay. The Christmas check still 
exists, but it is rare. 
</P>
<P>
By and large, the county is in line with the rest of the nation in not giving 
employees something simply because it's the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
"In effect, management now is saying, 'To the extent that you help us be 
successful, we'll help you be successful,' " Muller said Wednesday in a 
telephone interview from his Chicago office. 
</P>
<P>
The move away from holiday bonuses is part of a trend toward fewer benefits in 
general for employees and retirees, especially in health insurance, often in 
light of lower corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
Muller said the elimination of year-end bonuses is motivated more by 
management's desire to increase productivity than to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
But some Orange County firms are bucking the trend. 
</P>
<P>
Beckman Instruments of Fullerton, for example, is one of the few large 
companies in the United States in which each of its domestic employees receives 
a cash bonus not tied to a profit-sharing or incentive plans. Company founder 
Arnold O. Beckman "has always considered the company and its employees a 
family," said Elke Eastman, a spokeswoman for the company, which has 6,000 
employees in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The dGWB advertising agency in Irvine will be handing out "substantial" cash 
bonuses, said partner Jim deYong, who describes it as "a Christmas tradition." 
The 30 employees there "all work hard, so we try to share our appreciation with 
them in the way it will be most appreciated," deYong said. 
</P>
<P>
But many -- if not most -- Orange County firms are are skipping yuletide 
gift-giving altogether. Knott's Berry Farm, for one, has no holiday bonuses, 
although it puts on a Christmas party for employees and their families. "We 
have a profit-sharing program that's unrelated to Christmas," said spokesman 
Stuart A. Zanville, "but we close on Christmas Day so employees can spend the 
day with their families." 
</P>
<P>
While U.S. employers are becoming less generous with bonuses, their Japanese 
counterparts are becoming more so. Japanese companies ordinarily pay bonuses 
twice a year, in summer and before the new year. 
</P>
<P>
Winter bonuses at 291 Japanese companies averaged $4,870 this year, up 7.3% 
over last year, the biggest increase in nine years, the Japanese Federation of 
Employers Assn. said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
An association official in Tokyo attributed the increase to the prosperity of 
business in that country. 
</P>
<P>
Compensation experts in the United States said the traditional year-end bonus 
in this country typically represents 5% to 6% of annual pay for hourly workers 
and 10% to 15% for middle managers and executives. 
</P>
<P>
Muller had no statistics to support his contention that year-end bonuses are 
disappearing, but other experts say a trend toward incentive-based compensation 
is apparent. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a great deal of increase in the use of variable pay . . . tied to 
some performance measures," said Frank Belmonte, a compensation consultant with 
Hewitt Associates in Lincolnshire, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Kurisu of Strategic Compensation Associates in Los Angeles said Christmas 
bonuses are "kind of an anachronism" and are rarely found in large 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
However, at companies where year-end bonuses have been traditional, Belmonte 
said, workers often expect them and management may feel obliged to hand them 
out even if the company has not had a particularly good year.

"When you consider eliminating it, it's not an easy thing to do," he said. 
"It's a very emotional issue." 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, employers planning to replace the year-end bonus with an 
incentive-based program should give employees plenty of notice and clearly 
spell out which goals must be met to qualify for incentive pay. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't eliminate it and say nothing," Belmonte said. "Eliminate it and do a lot 
of communication and explanation."

THE JANE FONDA OF THE COUCH POTATO SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
She might be called the queen of the Barcolounger Boogaloo. When Jodi Stolove 
broke her foot several years ago, the energetic Los Angeles dance instructor 
could not have known it would be the first step in a career move that would 
take her from the pas de deux to the Danse Derriere. 
</P>
<P>
Chair Dancing, as Stolove, 31, has christened her rhythmic exercise program 
that is performed in a seated position, has been been featured at recreational 
centers around Southern California. Kaiser Permanente's Panorama City medical 
center is now offering classes through Stolove for patients suffering from 
arthritis, diabetes, and other ailments that limit their freedom of movement 
and the corporation is planning to pick up the program for distribution to its 
other centers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
The man who produced Jane Fonda's Workout series thinks Stolove might have hit 
on something big for an aging population of Americans, who might like to take a 
seat after years of jogging and the injuries it can cause. 
</P>
<P>
"I could make Chair Dancing into the next popular and profitable exercise fad," 
Sidney Galanty wrote recently to Stolove. 
</P>
<P>
Chair Dancing consists of exercises and dance-like movements performed in a 
chair. Both the legs and arms are used in repetitive movements that simulate 
playing a trombone, swimming the crawl stroke, flapping the arms like a bird, 
and tapping the toes. Stolove says the regimen can boost an exerciser's heart 
rate to 140 beats per minute, which she explains is high enough to achieve 
aerobic benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, it has been an absolute miracle. I had become extremely sedentary," 
said Cara Mitchell, 59, of North Hollywood. A hundred pounds overweight and 
suffering from arthritis, Mitchell once needed 20 minutes to climb stairs. 
</P>
<P>
Now, although she must still pause on each step, the trip takes only five 
minutes and she has lost 40 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
While Stolove says her techniques are used "in both hospital and out-patient 
programs," she contends her exercises are not designed solely for the infirm. 
Executives at Kaiser take breaks from high-level meetings by flailing their 
arms around, according to her instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Raised in the other Hollywood, the one in Florida, the outgoing Stolove took 
dance lessons as a child. Though she now stands 5 feet 7 inches and weighs a 
lithe 122 pounds, when young she was ridiculed for being overweight. But she 
kept dancing, especially tap and ballet, and eventually shed the pounds. After 
graduating from high school, she enrolled in the dance program at the 
University of Michigan, where a fellow ballet student was Madonna, whom Stolove 
recalls as "kind of a wild character." 
</P>
<P>
She stayed long enough to obtain degrees in psychology and dance, then headed 
west to California, where she began teaching ballroom dancing at the University 
of Judaism in Los Angeles. Then in 1983, she broke her foot. 
</P>
<P>
"What does a dance teacher do with a broken foot?" she asked in an interview in 
a San Fernando Valley restaurant, where she demonstrated her techniques to the 
interested amusement of other diners. "I began out of necessity teaching my 
class sitting down." 
</P>
<P>
But she did not turn her serendipitous discovery of dance by the seats of the 
pants into a vocation until after she was hired by a cruise liner to lead an 
exercise class during a month-long ocean voyage to Australia. Because it was 
difficult to stand and exercise on a rocking boat, she sat down once more. 
</P>
<P>
"Each day the class got bigger," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
When she returned to the United States she commissioned a friend to write 
original Chair Dancing music and recorded an audio tape that she still sells. 
From its beginnings two years ago, the program has grown to the point where 
there are now a dozen classes each week taught by 10 teachers at synagogues, at 
homes for the elderly, and at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
She has even led some of Kaiser's top executives, including the heads of 
medical departments. "I always ask people to play," she said. "I thought they 
would stare at me like I was from another planet." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the executives in three-piece suits broke up in laughter and joined 
right in. 
</P>
<P>
The contract with Kaiser could be a big break for her growing business, she 
said. The medical corporation has even allocated $40,000 to shoot a videotape 
of the 45-minute exercise program. If Galanty is right, she could even become 
the Jane Fonda of the sofa set. 
</P>
<P>
Mei-Ling Scwartz, the administrator of the Health Education department at 
Kaiser's Panorama City facility, extols the program for its simplicity and its 
application for people with all sorts of medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get aerobic activities without going to a gym," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"All you need is your body and your chair." 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser offers a six-week series of classes at its Freedom From Fat center. 
Among the most impressed by the results is Mitchell, the woman with arthritis, 
high blood pressure and a weight problem. 
</P>
<P>
She wanted to exercise but could not leap around in a shiny leotard. Despite 
her weight, she had always looked younger than her years, but felt "like a 
woman of 80." Since exercising every night, her tendinitis has eased and her 
joints have loosened. "Now my insides are beginning to feel like my outside," 
she said.

THERE'S A HUMAN SIDE TO BUSTER POINDEXTER; 
</P>

MUSIC: ONCE SEEN AS THE CONSUMMATE LOUNGE LIZARD, HE SAYS HE NOW APPEALS TO ALL 
AGES, A POINT HE'LL GET TO PROVE TONIGHT AT HAMPTON'S IN SANTA ANA.

<TEXT>
<P>
When introduced to the world at large two years ago, Buster Poindexter -- 
a.k.a. David Johansen, former cross-dressing front man of the legendary 
proto-punk New York Dolls -- presented an alter-ego nearly as impenetrable as 
Paul Reubens' Pee Wee Herman. 
</P>
<P>
Talking with Johansen/Poindexter then, one would have thought him to be the 
complete lounge lizard, his barrage of mannered, gravel-voiced show-biz quips 
and hipster jargon suggesting that he subsisted on cocktail olives and spent 24 
hours a day living in an Amaretto ad while awaiting induction into the Rat 
Pack. 
</P>
<P>
The cover of the new Poindexter disc, "Buster Goes Berserk," depicts the 
dapper, pompadoured singer being forcibly expelled from a strip joint, his face 
a rictus of untempered glee. The album's generation-hopping, world-roaming 
music is no less pleasure-bent, following well in the tracks of his aptly 
titled 1987 dance hit, "Hot Hot Hot." 
</P>
<P>
The professional Poindexter, who performs at Hampton's in Santa Ana tonight, 
may remain a one-man party. But, in speaking from New York earlier this week, 
his persona seemed much more reconciled with day-to-day life. With less of a 
full-time rasp to his voice now, Johansen explained that although there had 
been moments when his loungier-than-life personality caused him confusion, it 
confused others more. 
</P>
<P>
"My favorites are the little kids. For some reason they, 3 to 5 years old, 
really love Buster Poindexter. I think they think of me as a cartoon character 
or something. Sometimes parents will introduce me to their kids, and they look 
at me like they're in shock that I'm a human being. They probably see my videos 
and categorize me in their little filing system along with Bugs Bunny." 
</P>
<P>
That's not bad company for a fellow who used to wear lipstick and spend 300 
days a year on the road, as he put it, "sitting in a van with a bunch of 
head-bangers." Today, Johansen says he appeals to audiences from tykes to 
grandparents, but says the heart of what he does remains unchanged from his 
rock days. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's pretty much the same vibe. Basically I'm doing the same thing, 
I'm just doing it with music that really turns me on. The show I do now elicits 
the same response, but I can do it for more people now, because when I was 
doing the Johansen thing I was kind of playing to an audience of my peers, so 
to speak. Now, I'm playing to all ages." 
</P>
<P>
Johansen is pulling his broader audience by creating an amalgam from such 
diverse influences as Louis Prima, Louis Jordan, Caribbean soca music, South 
American dance musics, vocal jazz, rock and R&amp;B. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm affected by everything," he said, "and I like different people for 
different things: Bobby Darin for the way he tied his ties, Amos Milburn for 
the way he sang." 
</P>
<P>
He regards the expansion of influences to be a normal part of growth. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're a kid you want to have your own music. It's part of coming out 
into the world. You don't want to listen to your parents' music, or even your 
older brothers and sisters' music. But after a while you've heard it all, so 
you want to hear more stuff, and that's when you start getting into everything 
else that's going on. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, that's the thinking people; there are people who are 40 who are still 
banging their heads against the wall. But there's so much music going around, 
and if you can appreciate it, it's one of the nicer things about the planet." 
</P>
<P>
On a planet where so many un-nice things also occur, with daily news accounts 
of massacres, governments gone amok and environmental disasters, does he feel 
there's a proper place for his brand of carefree, dance-happy music? 
</P>
<P>
"What place is there for it? Well, between 9 and midnight -- you know what I'm 
trying to say? 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice if everybody was hip and knew what was going on, and all the 
problems of the world could be solved. But they don't, and we have to survive 
in the meantime. There's a lot of people who are doing the good work as far as 
that stuff is concerned. As far as I'm concerned, musically speaking, I think 
it would mess up my whole scene to do that. If I came out like 'Buster does his 
Phil Collins Guilt Album,' I think that would be career-icide. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that I don't lend credence and support to all this kind of stuff. 
There are lots of things I do, and I'm not going to get on a jag about how 
altruistic I am. But as far as making a living is concerned, I'm an 
entertainer. I'm one of the guys that does pretty much the happy stuff. And I 
think there's enough value in that, in helping to remind people how it feels to 
be alive. What I'm into is, 'Lets get everybody into this room and dig each 
other and forget about the bull for a little while.' " 
</P>
<P>
Johansen said he doesn't know what the '90s will hold for him, or anyone. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking about that the other day because some cable TV network called. 
They're going to have all these artists on, saying what they think the next 
decade will be like. I asked, 'What's it pay?' They said there was a $1,000 
honorarium. I said, 'For $1,000, I've got nothin' to say. Give me $10,000 and 
I'll invent a position.' But I don't even know what's going to happen 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
One project he would like to get off the ground is a Buster Poindexter film. He 
has had support roles in a number of movies, most notably "Scrooged" with Bill 
Murray, and will appear in the upcoming "Tales From the Dark Side -- The Movie" 
in a comedy/horror segment with William Hickey. 
</P>
<P>
But he envisions a star vehicle, ideally "a musical where, say, (reggae star) 
Eek-A-Mouse is my sidekick, and I get too big for my britches and he, through 
his wisdom, shows me the way, and I fall in love with Sandra Bernhard. I met 
Wayne Newton in Tahoe. I'd like to get him to play my father." One thing 
Johansen said the '90s won't hold is a New York Dolls reunion. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't have any interest in that. People talk about it all the time: 
There's always some sleazy promoter that's saying 'I could make you kids a 
million bucks.' But to me that would be like going to Siberia. I want to do 
things that are musical. When I was in the Dolls I had a great time. I consider 
it my college days, we had a ball. But you have to carry on. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people, they elude themselves. If that helps them get through the day 
that's fine, but that's not the way I can live. I just want to embrace the 
possibilities, and chew them up and spit them out." 
</P>
<P>
 Buster Poindexter sings at 7:30 and 10:30 p.m. at Hampton's, 3503 S. Harbor 
Blvd., Santa Ana. Admission: $27.50. Information: (714) 979-5511.

DAUGHTER OF CHILD STAR TO AUCTION 'OZ' FIGURINES

DANA POINT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If all goes well for Lidia Penge of Dana Point, the past could very well be the 
ticket to a more prosperous future. 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, Penge, then 24, flew to New York to explore the contents of a 
warehouse that had been left to her and her sisters by their mother, MGM child 
actress Jackie Horner. Like a time capsule, the warehouse had been unopened 
since 1953. 
</P>
<P>
For Penge, the trip was more than a chance to dust off old family photo albums 
and rustle the pages of quaint diaries. It was a chance to get to know a mother 
who died when Penge was only 14. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that there were items that had been in storage for 30 years, but it 
was just too expensive to take time off, fly back to New York and go through 
the stuff," Penge said recently. "I couldn't afford it until 1983 when my 
husband (then fiance) loaned me $1,500 to fly back." 
</P>
<P>
Among the glass records, dusty furniture and old books and China she found in 
the warehouse, Penge discovered five hand-painted plaster figurines, each about 
11 inches tall, of characters from MGM's 1939 film classic "The Wizard of Oz": 
Dorothy, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, the Scarecrow and Professor Marvel. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother had always told my sisters and me about things she had in storage in 
New York," says Penge, "but we didn't know that the Oz statues were there." 
Penge shipped them home along with some other items and put them on a closet 
shelf. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, the warehouse burned to the ground taking with it all the 
items that Penge had left behind. "If we had waited three months longer we 
would have had nothing," she said. "No statues, no pictures, no records. No 
link to my past." 
</P>
<P>
Last September, Penge heard about the pair of original "Oz" ruby slippers that 
netted $165,000 at a Christie's auction in June of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Her interest piqued, she took the statues to the Christie's office in Beverly 
Hills where an "Oz" specialist, Rhys Thomas, determined their age and 
speculated on the role they may have played in the actual production of the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
According to Thomas, the one-of-a-kind figurines bear a close resemblance to 
the illustrations in Frank L. Baum's book and probably were made by MGM artists 
as prototypes for the film. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas dates them between May and October of 1938 -- after the historic change 
of the slippers' color from silver to the better-for-Technicolor ruby-red, and 
before the casting of Judy Garland (the Dorothy figurine has blond hair, rather 
than Garland's brunette). 
</P>
<P>
Christie's researchers believe that producer Louis B. Mayer's secretary, Ida 
Koverman, gave the figures to Horner, who starred in MGM films "Smilin' 
Through" (1941) and "Panama Hattie" (1942) and who appeared as a regular in the 
"Our Gang" comedy series before becoming a concert pianist. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to cash in on a wave of public interest brought on by "The Wizard of 
Oz's" 50th anniversary, Penge has put the statues on Christie's auction block 
where they will be offered today. Bidding is expected to begin at around 
$10,000, but Penge is hoping that the statues will bring in a considerably 
higher sum. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing with the ruby slippers," she noted, "is that they were old and worn 
looking. Our statues were carefully stored for 30 years, wrapped in newspapers 
in a cold, dry, cement room. They're in almost perfect condition." However, the 
years have left their mark on two of the statues: Professor Marvel and, to a 
lesser degree, Dorothy, suffer from flaking and chipped paint. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Penge hopes that the figures will fetch enough money that, once she's 
split the proceeds with her three sisters (and given Christie's its cut of 
10%), she and her husband, a sales representative for Dimension Cable Services, 
will be able to make a down payment on a house. 
</P>
<P>
"As much as we'd like to keep the statues and hand them down, a house will be a 
more practical heirloom than the statues," she said. "Fortunately, we were able 
to get enough items from the warehouse before it burned that there is still 
plenty left to pass on." 
</P>
<P>
The other items include a pair of Franklin D. Roosevelt dolls made during the 
Depression and presented to Horner by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and a pair 
of ornate, Chinese throne chairs complete with hand-carved dragons and birds.

JOSEPH N. BELL: YEARLY SEARCH FOR RIGHT TREE SAPS THE SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Myth has it that one of the more joyous family activities of the year is 
Picking Out the Christmas Tree. The myth persists in spite of a growing body of 
evidence that on the stress scale it is pushing income tax time, back-to-school 
nights and extended family reunions. 
</P>
<P>
I've been through the Christmas tree dodge for enough years to have learned a 
few tricks, and if by sharing them with you here I can save a family or two, 
then all of my Christmas tree stress will have been worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
There are five variables that have to be resolved in selecting a Christmas 
tree: (1) when to buy it; (2) what type of tree to get; (3) whether or not to 
shop around; (4) how large it should be; and (5) how much to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
And dealing with these variables are two very broad types of buyers: the Small 
and Cheap group and the Let's-Get-It-Over-With-at-Whatever-Price group. 
</P>
<P>
(There are, of course, a number of mutations of these two groups that 
complicate the picture, but if the adults buying the tree belong to the same 
basic group, it is much easier to deal with the five variables.) 
</P>
<P>
The advantages of buying a Christmas tree early are that the lots aren't 
crowded, there is a wide assortment of trees from which to choose, and you can 
get it over with well ahead of Christmas, thereby making it possible to restore 
family unity before the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
The main disadvantage is that the lot owners are still euphoric about making a 
big enough killing to retire for the rest of the year and their trees are 
priced accordingly. You may also find that trees purchased early begin to 
disintegrate by Christmas Eve, thereby causing a fire hazard. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Small and Cheap group will want to shop endlessly at this stage 
of the game trying to find a bargain, and even the second group is likely to be 
appalled at paying enough for a tree to take the family to Hawaii for 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
So my advice is to wait until six to 10 days before Christmas, when the lot 
owners are feeling a lot of anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
A plain, simple, straight-arrow evergreen is decidedly the type of tree to get. 
Anything else will -- and should -- be regarded as ostentatious and an effort 
to use the holidays for social climbing. Flocked trees and exotic types belong 
in the lobby of the Irvine Co. or South Coast Plaza, not in your living room 
where you will be required to think about how much it cost every time you pass 
through. This is not a place to keep up with the Segerstroms. 
</P>
<P>
Shopping around is probably the greatest single cause of disunity. 
</P>
<P>
In general, most women like to shop better than most men. As a result, men tend 
to say, "I like it fine" when asked for an opinion of a tree at the first lot 
visited. Because he says this about every tree he is shown, the impact of his 
opinion dwindles steadily -- especially as panic approaches when it becomes 
clear the family group is probably going to check out another lot or two. 
</P>
<P>
Children are the man's natural ally here because they are eager to get a tree 
and take it home. They also tend to want the most expensive tree on the lot. My 
advice here is for the man to play it cool. Don't fawn over the first tree 
offered; say "hmmmm" a lot, and appear to be studying the contours of each 
entry. Then, when the psychological moment arrives, come down enthusiastically 
for one tree, preferably a relatively cheap evergreen. This works reasonably 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Size, of course, depends on the room in which the tree will stand. 
</P>
<P>
I am reminded of an answer -- probably apocryphal -- that Abraham Lincoln gave 
when asked how long a man's legs should be. Said Lincoln: "They should be long 
enough to reach from his tail to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
Same way with your Christmas tree. You know you're not going to be able to sell 
one of those coffee table models -- especially with children around -- so give 
in gracefully on this one. Just make sure it isn't so tall that you have to 
trim it at either top or bottom. 
</P>
<P>
And, finally, the price. This is the second most frequent cause of disunity. I 
don't think men generally are any more anxious to be ripped off than women, but 
they have a much higher tolerance for buying convenience by taking an 
overpriced tree if the alternative is spending the rest of the afternoon 
looking for a bargain. This frequently leads to one or the other partner 
saying, "Well, all right, then you decide," and stomping back to the car. 
</P>
<P>
Beware of this ploy. 
</P>
<P>
It will lead to endless second-guessing as the tree is found to have unsightly 
bare spots once you get it home or drops its needles and droops well before its 
time. 
</P>
<P>
This warning also applies to what on the surface seems a positive solution to 
the Christmas tree problem: "This year, why don't you just go out and buy it 
yourself and then we won't have all these arguments." 
</P>
<P>
This is an obvious trap that throws all the responsibility for a defective tree 
on a single member of the family. Don't fall into it. Everyone should carry 
this load equally. 
</P>
<P>
One other thing to which you should be alert. 
</P>
<P>
You will always visit a house or two over the holidays with a lovely, shapely 
tree which you will admire aloud. And the host or hostess will say, "Yes, and 
we got it for $1.79 three days before Christmas and they even delivered it." 
</P>
<P>
The tendency at this point is to think of the $50 beauty drooping and dumping 
needles in your living room and covertly speculate on setting fire to your 
friend's tree. 
</P>
<P>
Reject this kind of thinking. They may quite well be fudging on the price, and 
besides, you did the best you could, under difficult circumstances.

$16-MILLION HOLOCAUST FUND EMBEZZLED

<P>
A leader of West Germany's Jewish community who died last year embezzled nearly 
$16 million in government funds intended for Holocaust survivors, according to 
a report released today. 
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by federal and Jewish officials, added that attempts to 
get the money back have been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
After the January, 1988, death of Werner Nachmann, the 62-year-old chairman of 
the Central Council of Jews in Germany, investigators found that he had run a 
massive embezzlement scheme involving reparations paid by the West German 
government. 
</P>
<P>
It is the largest scandal to hit West Germany's Jewish community and led to 
calls for greater supervision of governmental funds intended as reparations for 
Jewish survivors of the Nazi terror. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators found that Nachmann, as the supervisor of the bank accounts where 
the money was kept, had been routinely skimming off the interest for his own 
use. 
</P>
<P>
The council has sued a bank, which the report did not identify, to try to get 
the money back. Other attempts to recover it have been unsuccessful, according 
to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the money went into a failing textile business and other firms Nachmann 
ran, and at one point the council threatened to bring charges against his 
family and co-workers to get it back. 
</P>
<P>
Today's final report said, however, that there were no grounds for criminal 
charges against any other people. Most of the embezzlement took place between 
1981 and 1987, and the scandal led to the resignation of the council's general 
secretary in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The embezzlement is based on the one side on Nachmann's criminal actions and 
on the other on a lack of oversight," said the report released by Interior 
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and current Jewish Community chief Heinz Galinski. 
</P>
<P>
Galinski said in July, 1988, the affair had inflicted "the worst damage" on the 
West German Jewish community, which numbers about 36,000 people. About 530,000 
Jews lived in Germany when the Nazis took power in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
Galinski also has said the federal government in Bonn should have played a more 
active role in supervising the fund, which totaled $210 million. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, West Germany has paid more than $43 billion in various forms of 
reparations to survivors of the Holocaust and their families.

Electrical service was restored early today to all of the 2,200 homes and 
businesses in Mission Viejo that lost power when an underground electrical 
cable failed, a Southern California Edison spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The blackout occurred at 10:22 p.m. Wednesday evening. Most of the affected 
homes had their power restored within an hour, all within an hour and 45 
minutes, SCE spokesman Steve Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the load has been restored and we will be replacing the cable in the 
near future," he said. The rapid restoration of power was accomplished by 
switching circuits around the failed cable. 
</P>
<P>
The area affected was west of the San Diego Freeway, east of Madero Street, 
north of Los Alisos Boulevard and south of Alicia Parkway.

A nurse was convicted today of killing four patients by injecting them with a 
powerful drug in a scheme to revive them and look like a hero. 
</P>
<P>
A jury deliberated eight days before finding 27-year-old Richard Angelo guilty 
of murder in two deaths, manslaughter in one and criminally negligent homicide 
in the fourth. All four deaths occurred in 1987 at a Long Island hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo also was convicted of assault in connection with the deaths and on three 
counts of assault for giving injections to a patient who survived. He was 
acquitted of assault in connection with two other patients whose deaths could

Disgraced former East German leader Erich Honecker will have to leave his 
luxury home by February so that it can be turned into a center for the 
handicapped, a government spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said the secluded country compound at Wandlitz, where 
Communist bosses used to live in luxury, will be turned into a 400-bed 
rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the ailing Honecker, 77, and other former top Communist Party members 
now under house arrest will be evicted from the Wandlitz compound north of 
Berlin, Meyer said he assumed that "all will move out by February." 
</P>
<P>
Meyer told a news conference that the government is considering the creation of 
an "inquiry department" to examine allegations of fraud, corruption and abuse 
of office by former leaders. Honecker, who is reported to be very depressed, is 
among those accused and is expected to stand trial.

PROBE OF RAPE AT GOVERNOR'S MANSION IN S.D.

<TEXT>
<P>
A special prosecutor has been appointed to investigate a report of a rape at 
the governor's mansion at a time when apparently only Gov. George S. 
Mickelson's 17-year-old son was in residence. 
</P>
<P>
Mickelson said the investigation is causing agony for his family. 
</P>
<P>
The special prosecutor, Craig Kennedy, said Wednesday he expects the Pierre 
Police Department to complete its investigation into the rape report within the 
next few days. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy and other officials refused to discuss details of the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Police received a report on Nov. 30 alleging there had been a forcible rape at 
the mansion two days earlier. A statement on a police log sheet said: "Four 
boys at mansion raped her." 
</P>
<P>
The Republican governor was in Washington at a U.S. Department of Agriculture 
conference on Nov. 28. His wife, Linda, was in Texas at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The Mickelsons' son, David, a senior at Riggs High School, is the only other 
family member who is a permanent resident of the mansion. Two older children do 
not live in Pierre. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether David was traveling with either parent on Nov. 28, Mickelson 
press secretary Gretchen Lord Anderson replied, "We don't feel that where David 
was is relevant."

Parliament today postponed action on a motion to abolish the Communist Party's 
43-year-old monopoly on power, provoking an outraged response from more than 
20,000 pro-democracy demonstrators outside. 
</P>
<P>
Bulgarians had widely expected the legislature to approve a request by the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party to strike a clause from the 
constitution guaranteeing the party's leading role. 
</P>
<P>
After state radio announced the decision to defer discussion on the motion for 
a month, the thousands of protesters outside Parliament became angry. 
</P>
<P>
"We are here!" the demonstrators shouted in unison to the Communist deputies 
inside. "Come on out!" 
</P>
<P>
Officials justified the decision by citing a little-known law stating that any 
motion to change the constitution must be acted on not less than a month after 
it is made but no later than three months afterward. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the party's governing Central Committee closed a three-day 
meeting by voting to propose that Parliament strike two clauses from the 
constitution that enshrine the party's "leading role." 
</P>
<P>
If the proposal had been adopted by Parliament today, Romania and the Soviet 
Union would have become the only Warsaw Pact countries where the Communists' 
political supremacy is legally guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
At a Communist-sponsored rally Wednesday evening, about 60,000 people cheered 
Petar Mladenov, who heads the party, when he told them that the party had 
decided to scrap its guaranteed leading role. 
</P>
<P>
This has been a key demand of the opposition, for which thousands of people 
expressed support in recent days by joining in mass rallies. 
</P>
<P>
"Our glorious party doesn't need this (guarantee) anymore," Mladenov told the 
rally outside party headquarters. "Without it we can win."

SHEVARDNADZE TO SEE NATO HEADQUARTERS AT HIS OWN REQUEST

<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will make an unprecedented visit 
to NATO headquarters next week in a move symbolizing the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet foreign minister has requested that he be able to contact NATO 
during his visit to Belgium on Dec. 18 and 19," a NATO spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now trying to arrange for Mr. Shevardnadze to have a meeting with NATO 
Secretary-General Manfred Woerner on one of those two days." 
</P>
<P>
No Warsaw Pact minister has ever entered NATO headquarters and until recently 
the idea would have been dismissed as absurd. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the 16 NATO foreign ministers, on the first day of a two-day meeting, 
set aside a dispute between Greece and Turkey, clearing the way for the Western 
alliance to present a draft treaty on cutting conventional forces in Europe 
(CFE). 
</P>
<P>
The Warsaw Pact countries put forward their proposals at the CFE talks in 
Vienna today, several hours ahead of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known why Shevardnadze proposed the NATO visit. He is due to meet 
European Community foreign ministers in Brussels next Monday and to sign a 
trade agreement with the EC. 
</P>
<P>
A French official said the visit was discussed Wednesday evening at a dinner 
attended by the foreign ministers of Britain, France, the United States and 
West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be named, said the ministers decided that 
Shevardnadze would first meet Woerner and then confer with all 16 ambassadors 
to NATO headquarters in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
NATO diplomats said it was not immediately clear whether the 
Woerner-Shevardnadze talks would have a fixed agenda. "The visit has an obvious 
symbolic importance, though," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men are expected to discuss the changes sweeping Eastern Europe, the 
current state of arms control and East-West relations. 
</P>
<P>
The 16 ministers cleared the way for the NATO proposals on conventional-force 
reductions to be presented at Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
"A certain amount of time was spent reaching agreement on how we table the NATO 
draft in the CFE negotiations in Vienna which is being (presented) today, so 
that was settled," British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said. 
</P>
<P>
The draft was being held up because of a dispute between Greece and Turkey over 
whether to include the Turkish port of Mersin in the area for arms cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd said the row had not been settled but both Greece and Turkey had agreed to 
set it aside so that the draft treaty could be tabled on behalf of all NATO 
members. 
</P>
<P>
The Western proposal envisages cutting American and Soviet troops in Europe to 
275,000 on each side and scrapping thousands of tanks, big guns and aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The ceiling of 275,000 troops for each superpower was first proposed by 
President Bush in May. U.S. officials said then that it would involve a cut of 
30,000 men by the United States and 325,000 by the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey are at loggerheads over Mersin because it is the main Turkish 
port for reinforcing the Turkish-backed, self-declared independent enclave of 
northern Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
Greece wants the port to be included in the area for CFE reductions while 
Turkey wants to keep it out.

Cuban authorities refused to reconsider their decision, but agreed to accredit

Japan's steel exports in 1989 are likely to fall below 20 million tons for the 
first time in 19 years, the top official of the Japanese steel industry 
predicted today. 
</P>
<P>
Hiroshi Saito, president of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation and chairman of 
Nippon Steel Corp., cited sluggish exports to China following the events in 
Tian An Men Square last June as one of the major factors. 
</P>
<P>
He also said brisk domestic demand has compelled Japanese steel makers to 
refrain from exports, which bring them a slimmer profit margin than domestic 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's steel exports in 1988 totaled 23.65 million tons.

NORTHROP TO SELL CENTURY CITY OFFICES TO REDUCE ITS DEBT

Northrop Corp., whose value on the New York Stock Exchange has tumbled below 
that of the real estate it owns, plans to sell its tony headquarters complex in 
Century City, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to reduce our debt, we're actively looking at the sale of our 
non-operating assets," spokesman Tony Cantafio said in an interview published 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop is not the first aerospace company to try to cash in on real estate 
recently as prospects for defense work have dimmed. Last month, F-14 maker 
Grumman Corp. said it would redevelop nearly half its 500-acre headquarters on 
Long Island, N.Y., with a hotel, shopping center and offices. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop sent information packages to 10 prospective buyers on its two Century 
Park East buildings about a month ago, asking $247.5 million for them, Mike 
DeSantis, a vice president of the Cushman &amp; Wakefield real estate 
brokerage, was quoted by Copley Los Angeles Newspapers as saying. 
</P>
<P>
However, DeSantis said today that he had never estimated a price for the 
buildings.

NEW JAGUAR WILL GO 200 M.P.H. AND COST $587,000

British luxury car maker Jaguar said today that it will produce a new 
200-m.p.h. sports model to compete with Ferrari and Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
The Jaguar XJ220 will have a price tag of about $587,000 and production will be 
limited to an initial 220 cars, or at most 350 if there is enough interest. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar's chairman, Sir John Egan, announced the new car just two days after the 
$2.6-billion takeover of the company by Ford Motor Co. was finalized. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar unveiled a prototype of the XJ220 last year, but executives at the firm 
feared that it would never go on sale because flagging profits would prevent 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Customers are asked to put down an $80,000 deposit, and they will have to wait 
until 1992 before the models roll off the production line. 
</P>
<P>
The wait could be worth it. The Times of London estimated that collectors will 
be prepared to pay $1.6 million because of the tiny production run.

A former bodyguard for rap singer LL Cool J was convicted of raping a 
15-year-old girl after a concert in the Twin Cities in August. 
</P>
<P>
The Hennepin County District Court jury deliberated about 10 hours before 
issuing a verdict Wednesday night convicting Christopher Tsipouras, 22, Union, 
N.J., of first- and third-degree sexual assault. Judge Philip Bush set 
sentencing for Jan. 5, revoked Tsipouras' $100,000 bail and placed him in 
custody. State guidelines recommend a prison sentence of more than seven years. 
</P>
<P>
Tsipouras was charged with sexually assaulting the girl at a Bloomington hotel 
on Aug. 9. Two other members of the entourage -- singer David Parker and crew 
member Gary Saunders -- are awaiting trial on charges of sexually assaulting 
the girl later that night. 
</P>
<P>
The victim and a 16-year-old girlfriend had won backstage passes from a radio 
station.

ABC-TV has asked Universal Television to produce an hour pilot episode based on 
the film "K-9" for consideration as a TV series, the Hollywood Reporter trade 
newspaper said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The tried and true method of transforming hit feature films into TV series 
candidates already prompted CBS-TV to order 13 episodes of "Uncle Buck" from 
Universal for next year. 
</P>
<P>
"K-9," starring Jim Belushi as a cop whose partner was an expressive German 
shepherd, grossed about $40 million in the United States after it was released 
in April.

BUCHWALD'S SUIT COMING TO TRIAL

<TEXT>
<P>
Trial was scheduled to get under way today in a $5-million lawsuit filed by 
humorist Art Buchwald against Paramount Pictures over the film "Coming to 
America." 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit filed in November, 1988, the motion picture was 
inspired by and based upon a movie treatment written by Buchwald. 
</P>
<P>
The Pulitzer-prize winning columnist and author claims he created the concept 
in 1983 about a handsome, wealthy and spoiled young African king who comes to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The columnist claims the story line called for the king to lose his title and 
money to his brother in a coup, forcing him to live in an American ghetto and 
work in a fast-food restaurant. During his stay, he falls in love with a 
beautiful woman and makes her his queen when he is reinstated as the monarch of 
his country. 
</P>
<P>
But actor Eddie Murphy, who starred in the movie, has said he came up with the 
idea for "Coming to America," which grossed more than $128 million in 1988. The 
film is about an African prince named Akeem who comes to New York, lives in a 
slum, gets a job at a fast-food restaurant, meets the woman of his dreams and 
returns to his country, where he marries the woman.

'BATMAN' VIDEO DEFEATS 'E.T.' IN RENTAL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Warner Home Video's "Batman" has soared to new heights in the video rental 
business with 9.8 million transactions counted in two weeks, according to the 
New York research firm of Alexander &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
The film noir version of the comic book hero's clash with the Joker rang in an 
estimated $21 million in holiday rentals from its Nov. 17 release until Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Batman's two-week rental record eclipsed the previous high set by "E.T. The 
Extra-Terrestrial," beating the bicycle-levitating alien by "more than 3 
million turns," said Robert Alexander, the firm's president. 
</P>
<P>
Batman's velocity also helped carry the video industry to its best week 
overall, said Alexander, who counted 94.8 million video rentals for the week 
ending Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
The previous high was 91.8 million in rentals, set in the last week of 
November, 1988, when "E.T." was released. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to video sales, however, it appears that MCA Home Video's "E.T." 
probably will outperform "Batman." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts estimate that about 4.2 million copies of "Batman" have been sold to 
consumers, with about 1.3 million representing sales to video rental operators. 
</P>
<P>
Retailers indicated that "Batman" sales are about half the pace of "E.T."

PREGNANCY DOESN'T SLOW DOWN NBC NEWSWOMAN

<P>
She's 8 1/2 months pregnant. It's snowing. And she's just spent several hours 
on a train. Just exactly how is Mary Alice Williams feeling? 
</P>
<P>
"Fine," she answers in a voice octaves higher than her measured network news 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind the words. Her expression tells all. She rolls her icy blue eyes, 
wrinkles her nose and grimaces. It's an expression you'd never see on NBC, 
where Williams, 40, is a correspondent and substitute anchor. 
</P>
<P>
"These last couple weeks are really rough," said Williams, who was visiting 
Baltimore this week to to speak at the Maryland State Employees Conference. "I 
had made the commitment before I was pregnant, and you can't just back out. But 
we are pushing it." 
</P>
<P>
Her life has been in a state of flux for the past nine months since she 
accepted a position with NBC. The decision meant leaving the safe environs of 
Cable Network News, where she had worked for a decade and earned the title of 
vice president. Just weeks after beginning at NBC, she and her husband Mark 
Haefeli learned they are expecting a baby. And last month, "Yesterday, Today 
and Tomorrow," the controversial news show she co-anchored with Maria Shriver 
and Chuck Scarborough was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is predictable," she says wistfully. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' pregnancy came as a surprise since she had been told by doctors she 
couldn't conceive. 
</P>
<P>
Her initial reaction? "Shock and terror and elation," she says. 
</P>
<P>
She plans to work right up until going into labor and is uncertain how much 
maternity leave she will take.

WATTS TRIES SAVING 'HOMEROOM'

<P>
Parents and teachers in the Watts district vowed to petition ABC to save 
"Homeroom," a half-hour comedy series they say helps keep their kids in school. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which debuted in the fall, is being canceled because of poor 
ratings, said ABC spokesman Jim Brochu. 
</P>
<P>
"All we're saying is give the show a chance," said Jim Goins, who counsels 
school dropouts in the largely minority Watts area. He and other parents and 
teachers decided to petition the network after a meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not that many shows of color that deal with educational issues, and 
we're in a dilemma right now as far as having black male role models," Goins 
said. "Not everyone can be a Bill Cosby." 
</P>
<P>
"The Cosby Show," NBC's top-rated comedy, stars Bill Cosby as an upper-class 
doctor living in New York with his lawyer-wife and children. 
</P>
<P>
"Homeroom" stars Darryl Sivad as a man who gave up a lucrative job in 
advertising to teach fourth graders at an inner-city public school.

If Fernando Valenzuela leaves the Los Angeles Dodgers, it won't be to join the 
New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees said today that they are not interested in signing the free agent 
left-hander. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a lot of talk in the media concerning an apparent Yankee 
interest in Fernando Valenzuela, and that is simply not true," George Bradley, 
New York's vice president of player personnel, said in a statement. "The 
Yankees have never been interested in Valenzuela nor have we had any 
conversations with Fernando or his agent. Any information contradicting that is 
untrue." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Moss, Valenzuela's agent, said Wednesday that he expected a deal for 
the pitcher would be reached shortly. Valenzuela, 10-13 with a 3.43 earned-run 
average, earned $1.85 million last season. The Dodgers have offered him a 
one-year contract with an option year but he wants a guaranteed multi-year 
deal.

Montreal Expos owner Charles Bronfman said today he would consider selling the 
team but only if the purchaser agreed to keep the club in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos owner responded to a report in this week's issue of Sports 
Illustrated that said Bronfman wants to sell and that a Florida investment 
group in Orlando or St. Petersburg might bid for the franchise early in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking of selling, but not to just anyone," Bronfman said. "The most 
important thing for me is that the team stays in Montreal." 
</P>
<P>
The Expos have lost Mark Langston, Bryn Smith and Pascual Perez to free agency 
and replaced them with Joaquin Andujar, Oil Can Boyd and Dave Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
"The Expos are run by good baseball men," Bronfman said. "Don't worry, we'll be 
there this year and we'll be more competitive than some people have been led to 
believe."

ATTEND NCAA, COLLEGE PRESIDENTS URGED

<P>
An American Council on Education official today urged college and university 
presidents to attend the NCAA's annual meeting and support a proposal requiring 
colleges to disclose how many of their athletes graduate. 
</P>
<P>
James Whalen, president of Ithaca College who is completing his term as 
chairman of the ACE Board of Directors, said the NCAA meeting Jan. 7-9 in 
Dallas will "deal with issues vital to the future of our institutions." 
</P>
<P>
Whalen, in a letter to the presidents of about 840 NCAA schools urged them to 
support the graduation disclosure plan. 
</P>
<P>
Citing proposed legislation that would require such disclosure, Whalen said 
that if the NCAA does not adopt such a policy, "the Congress of the United 
States will do it for us." 
</P>
<P>
"Federal intrusion in this area would set a very dangerous precedent and would 
open a door that we will never be able to close again," said Whalen. 
</P>
<P>
The highest number of presidents ever to turn up at an NCAA meeting was 199, 
Whalen said, "and 25% participation is simply not enough." He said many 
presidents designate another person, usually the athletic director, to attend 
the convention. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the presidents recognize the need to participate actively in the NCAA, 
"we're making a very serious mistake and our credibility will be very, very 
poor," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The letter also asked for support of a proposal to shorten the football and 
basketball seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We genuinely believe that these are meaningful proposals, and that they 
represent real steps toward reform," Whalen said in the letter. "They are not 
the final answer, of course; but they are a good beginning, and they will be 
adopted only if we have the support of our colleagues." 
</P>
<P>
Whalen acknowledged that the presidents at many NCAA institutions have little 
control over their athletics departments and some have grown used to the extra 
revenue generated by the various programs. But, he insisted, "the president 
must take responsibility for all aspects of that institution, including 
athletics."

Jim Gott said he left the Pittsburgh Pirates to sign with the Dodgers because 
he didn't "need to be around negative people." 
</P>
<P>
Gott, who had 34 saves in 1988, said the Pirates' management made little effort 
to re-sign him and is skeptical he will recover from an elbow injury that 
forced him to miss all but one game last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved the time I spent in Pittsburgh. I loved the city. I loved the team, I 
loved playing there," he said. " . . . But the (team's) attitude was, 'We've 
made you an offer. It's not going to change. Take it or leave it.' 
</P>
<P>
"After all the good experiences we'd had in Pittsburgh, that hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Gott told the Johnstown Tribune-Democrat that the Dodgers, acting on the advice 
of arm specialist Dr. Frank Jobe, expressed confidence he can return in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"That confidence was important to me," Gott said. "In Pittsburgh, they were 
expressing a lot of doubt. A guy with two major injuries like I've had doesn't 
need to be around negative people. The Dodgers have been positive all the way 
down the line." 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tom Lasorda said that he will use Gott, Jay Howell and Alejandro Pena 
to close out games and that Gott's attitude was a major reason why the Dodgers 
signed him. 
</P>
<P>
"Tommy said they'd gotten away from having fun in the clubhouse last year, that 
they weren't loose enough," Gott said. "And he's depending on me to help do 
something about that." 
</P>
<P>
Gott will make $300,000 with the Dodgers and can earn an additional $700,000 if 
he is not on the disabled list 21 days after the season starts. The Pirates 
offered him $300,000 in base salary and $800,000 in incentives, but, Gott said, 
"some of the incentives were unrealistic."

Nadia Comaneci plopped down nearly $20,000 in traveler's checks on a Camaro 
convertible and shopped her way through clothing stores this week, sales clerks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Escorted by Constantin Panait, the married roofer who has accompanied the 
Olympic gold-medal gymnast since she fled Romania, Comaneci was staying in a 
$130-a-night suite at the Best Western Beachcomber Resort and Villas here 
through Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Martin, a salesman at Maroone Chevrolet here, said he sold Comaneci the 
Camaro, a black convertible automatic with gray bucket seats. 
</P>
<P>
She originally had her eye on a used Corvette, he said, but Martin -- on his 
first day as a salesman -- steered her toward the convertible. 
</P>
<P>
"She fell in love with it," he said. "In her country, all they have is stick 
shifts." 
</P>
<P>
Dealership manager Ken Pataki said Comaneci whipped out a wad of traveler's 
checks to close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
At a department store she got a 30% discount on a $184 dress, said Phyllis 
Paul, a clerk at the store. She also stopped at the cosmetic and shoe counters, 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
The stay at the hotel and some of the shopping spree and her bar tab were 
apparently paid by British tabloids, which sent writers and photographers to 
accompany Comaneci, hotel employees said.

L.A., WATER AGENCY FIGHT OVER SANTA CLARITA PARCEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angels official warned the Castaic Lake Water Agency Wednesday night that 
the city will fight any attempt by the agency to condemn 520 acres of 
city-owned land in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
C. William Mercer, chief administrative analyst with the city, leveled the 
warning as the water agency's board of directors considered a proposal to begin 
eminent domain proceedings to take possession of the defunct Saugus 
Rehabilitation Center. 
</P>
<P>
The water agency hopes to use about 60 to 80 acres of the old alcoholic 
rehabilitation center for a drinking water treatment plant. The agency's sole 
plant near Castaic Lake is nearing capacity, and the agency will need a second 
plant to serve the growing Santa Clarita Valley in two years, water officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council also wants parts of the Saugus property for a 
park, civic center and possibly an arts complex. 
</P>
<P>
Mercer said Los Angeles would not sell the entire property to the water agency, 
but would be willing to negotiate over the acreage needed just for the water 
filtration plant. Until September, he said, city officials assumed the water 
district was interested only in a small portion of the property. 
</P>
<P>
Mercer said Los Angeles wants to hold on to most of the site for its value as a 
bargaining chip in negotiations over opening a garbage dump in Elsmere Canyon 
just east of Santa Clarita. Under a tentative agreement involving the city and 
country of Los Angeles, the city would give a portion of the Saugus site to 
Santa Clarita if that city agrees not to oppose the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council has not yet opposed or endorsed the landfill or 
the city-county pact. 
</P>
<P>
In September, the water agency and the Santa Clarita Council agreed they would 
jointly try to acquire the rehabilitation center, with the water agency leading 
the purchase. The agency offered Los Angeles $15.8 million for the property, 
but Los Angeles officials said the bid was too low. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's board did not respond to Mercer's comments because its 
condemnation plans have been stymied, at least momentarily, by objections 
raised by the city of Santa Clarita and a civic group. Santa Clarita officials 
and the Santa Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment said the water 
agency should prepare a full environmental impact report before proceeding with 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Robert C. Sagehorn, the water agency's general manager, said the agency could 
not proceed with the condemnation proceedings until it resolves the issue of 
the environmental impact report. The agency staff should have a response to the 
request for such a report in the next few days, he said.

FROZEN MICROWAVABLE SNACKS: FOODS FOR MOOD RATHER THAN NUTRITION; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: AMERICANS ARE SPENDING MORE AND MORE ON THESE TYPES OF FOODS -- FROM 
LEAN POCKET SANDWICHES AND PIZZAS TO BROWNIES AND MILK SHAKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A joke floating around comedy clubs a few years ago concerned a then-overweight 
(but since slimmed-down) actress who stood in front of her microwave shouting, 
"Hurry, hurry." 
</P>
<P>
For the actress, and for most of the rest of us, speed is essential. Less 
significant to the actress, but more important to the rest of us, are the ways 
the pressures of a two-income family have shortened the amount of time most 
people spend cooking. 
</P>
<P>
The pressures have an impact in other areas as well, but nowhere do the 
hurry-up tendencies of daily life mesh with the possibilities of the microwave 
as well as they do in the area of frozen, microwavable snack foods. Although 
there are other choices when it comes to microwavable snacks, from popcorn to 
individual-serving soups, the frozen foods case is where folks in a hurry will 
find the greatest variety of quick snacks. 
</P>
<P>
There are no specific statistics on frozen, microwavable snacks -- the kind 
that, typically, come prepackaged in individual servings and can be prepared 
within minutes and eaten quickly and informally, using hands rather than the 
generally accepted polite utensils. 
</P>
<P>
But Americans have been spending more and more on frozen foods in general, and 
that would include microwavable snacks. Manufacturers are turning out 
everything from Lean Pocket sandwiches and pizzas to brownies and milk shakes. 
Most of these choices are goodies picked to suit a mood rather than a specific 
nutrition plan. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by the American Frozen Food Institute show that U.S. 
shoppers spent $9 billion more and ate 113 million pounds more frozen foods in 
1988 than they did during the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,510 new frozen-food products were introduced during 1988, and an equal 
number of new products were introduced during the past year, according to 
Steven Anderson, chief executive officer for the American Frozen Food 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
In our health-conscious times, a legitimate concern with microwavable snacks is 
their nutritional value, especially when compared with ready-made snacks or 
snacks prepared from mixes. 
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, most of the microwave products are, in my opinion, high in fat 
and in sodium in particular," says Tina Amato, a registered dietitian with the 
Allentown (Pa.) Health Bureau. "There are some better selections you can choose 
within each of the categories." Frozen soft pretzels or individual-serving 
vegetable packs rather than a Danish or sausage biscuits are examples. 
</P>
<P>
Amato suggested people avoid microwavable snacks that have no nutritional 
labels on them. Typically, only foods that make some type of health claim are 
required to display a label, which would provide information on the amount of 
fat, sodium and other health-related information. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers should also look at the amount of fat, measured in grams, and sodium, 
measured in milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
Any product with a single serving that registers more than 5 grams of fat or 
240 milligrams of sodium should be avoided, Amato says. Avoid palm oil (As a 
rule of thumb, palm oil is the least expensive of most commonly used oils, so 
if several oils, including palm oil, are listed, bet on the palm oil). 
</P>
<P>
Jayne Hurley, a registered dietitian with the Center for Science and Public 
Policy, said that tests were done comparing a microwavable cake mix to a boxed 
cake mix that someone would prepare at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Both are very fatty," says Hurley. "I don't know if you can make a case for 
them (microwavable snacks) being worse than prepackaged. They are certainly as 
fatty as those other products. There is no net positive or negative." 
</P>
<P>
Microwavable foods are "no worse than and no better than the ones you are 
whipping up at home. At home, you have more control over the ingredients. You 
can substitute skim milk instead of whole milk. You can cut fat and sugar. You 
have more control whenever you are making the food yourself," Hurley says. 
</P>
<P>
Will the sheer convenience of the microwavable food snacks pose problems for 
some? 
</P>
<P>
Hurley said they might. 
</P>
<P>
"When people are dieting, we recommend they only have foods in the house that 
need to be prepared," Hurley said. "So, if you want to binge on cookies and 
cake, you have to get eggs and milk out and make them. Chances are, you are not 
going to do that. The convenience of (microwavable foods) might lead to an 
increase in consumption for these kind of products." 
</P>
<P>
Judith Newman, a specialist on eating disorders at Pennsylvania State 
University's Ogontz Campus, says that the convenience of the foods will not 
matter much to the anorexic, who suffers from appetite loss. For the bulimic, 
or the binge eater, the quickness of the foods' preparation may in fact feed 
the food addiction. 
</P>
<P>
However, with extreme cases of binge eaters, Newman said, it is not uncommon 
for them to "eat frozen pastries or dough before it is cooked. They eat raw 
things. Once that drive comes over them to binge, the taste of the food or the 
texture of the food is really unimportant." 
</P>
<P>
Snacking has gotten a bad name, Hurley says, mostly because of the kinds of 
snacks people choose. Eating several smaller meals a day is no better or worse 
than eating the traditional three square meals, Hurley says. It is what is 
chosen that is important. 
</P>
<P>
Assigned to eat my way through the frozen-snack category and critique the 
choices, I found some winners as well as some losers. 
</P>
<P>
Celeste Vegetable Pizza-For-One: High in fat (26 grams) and high in sodium 
(1,260), the pizza would not get rave reviews from the dietitians but still got 
excellent remarks from an ad hoc committee of tasters. Vegetables were good and 
a crisping disk included in the package to help keep the crust crisp worked as 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
Acme Breakfast Sandwich: This version included sausage, egg and cheese on a 
biscuit. The biscuit was too floury for my tastes. But overall, it was equal to 
the kind of sandwich one might get out of a vending machine. Another category 
with alarming statistics. This brand contained 1,450 milligrams sodium and 29 
grams of fat. 
</P>
<P>
Lean Pockets Chicken Supreme: Of the non-sweet foods tested, this was tops for 
taste and nutrition. It was very low in fat (4 grams), but didn't offer any 
data on sodium content. The crust was crisp and the chicken stuffing was tasty. 
</P>
<P>
Oh Boy Stuffed Potatoes: Because these came two to a box, there was enough to 
put it before the tasting committee. One tester thought the potato was bland 
but passable. Another felt somewhat deceived by the box, which listed real 
bacon was included in the potatoes. She found only tiny bacon bits and also 
thought the potato was peppery, but not to a degree that would make the potato 
inedible. Each stuffed potato takes about four minutes to cook -- enough time 
to make one wonder if it wouldn't be far smarter to microwave a real potato and 
season to taste. 
</P>
<P>
Hormel New Traditions Cheeseburger: As might be expected, the fat content here 
is high (19 grams) and the sodium fairly high as well (550 milligrams). This 
brand requires only that the hamburger be defrosted for about 4 minutes, so 
folks with a microwave that doesn't have a defrost mode may have to guess as to 
cooking times -- a critical point when it comes to final quality. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Lee Classic Cheesecakes: At 200 calories, 14 grams fat and 150 milligrams 
sodium, these tasty treats (four individual snacks) exact a steep nutritional 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperidge Farm's Newport Hot Fudge Brownie: This is part of Pepperidge Farm's 
American Collection, and while the individual-serving brownie is kind to the 
taste buds, it is rather pricey. I paid $1.39 for it at a convenience store, 
but the item is discounted slightly at supermarkets. No nutritional data is 
provided; probably because a snacker is probably better off not knowing the 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Rachel's Double Chocolate Brownies: Rachel, bless her, is most likely on the 
Weight Watchers hit list. The 1-pound tray of frozen Rachel's (with walnuts) is 
too good to be sold without a license or a prescription. Worst of all, you can 
eat the brownies when still frozen (Rachel suggests it on the back of the box) 
for a different taste treat. There are no health claims on this box, and, 
therefore, a snacker has no idea just how good or how bad these things are for 
him or her, which might be a small blessing. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Lee Chocolate Fudge Cakes: These relatively dry cakes (six individually 
wrapped snacks) are better with coffee or tea than alone. They are of medium 
caloric content (190) and high in fat content (10 grams per). The sodium level 
was at a reasonable level (125 milligrams). 
</P>
<P>
Oregon Farms Carrot Cake: A fairly tasty, fairly moist carrot cake (cream 
cheese frosting with walnuts). Again, no nutritional information. For the 
calorie-conscientious among us, you can slice one or two pieces of the frozen 
cake and place the rest safely back in the freezer. The slices can be 
microwaved to thaw. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Lee Corn and Oat Bran Muffins: Both muffins come in packaging that allows 
the user to microwave one, or several. The corn muffins are tastier than the 
oat bran muffins, which are bland tasting. The oat bran muffins are also on the 
dry side. Of the two, the corn muffins had more fat per serving -- 13 grams, 
compared to the oat bran muffin's 8 grams. Also, they both were fairly high in 
sodium -- 330 milligrams for the corn, 320 milligrams for the oat.

POLL FINDS DESIRE FOR CAR-POOL INCENTIVES; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HALF OF WORKERS SAY THEY WOULD CONSIDER 
RIDE-SHARING IF THEY GOT A SUBSIDY AND A GUARANTEED LIFT HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MARTHA L. WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
A slim majority of employees who drive alone to work in Glendale might switch 
to ride-sharing if they were guaranteed a ride home in an emergency and paid a 
subsidy, according to a survey released last week by the Glendale 
Transportation Management Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of 5,092 employees at nine key Glendale work sites, conducted by 
Commuter Transportation Services, is the first comprehensive study of employee 
travel habits in the city. 
</P>
<P>
It found that almost 77% drive alone to work. But slightly more than half those 
surveyed -- 51.6% -- would consider ride-sharing, at least occasionally, if 
given the right incentives. 
</P>
<P>
The other 48.4% said they will not car-pool no matter what incentives are 
offered. Most of those said that they need a car for personal use before, 
during or after work or that they work irregular hours. 
</P>
<P>
The guaranteed ride home in the event of a family emergency or unexpected 
change in work hours is critical to persuading drivers to leave their cars at 
home, said Carol Redfern of Commuter Transportation. "People fear getting 
stranded." 
</P>
<P>
Of those who drive alone, 38% said they would consider car-pooling if they knew 
they had alternative transportation, such as a voucher for taxi fare. Redfern 
said a similar program has boosted the success of a ride-sharing program at 
Warner Center in the west San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 24% of the drivers said they would give up their car at least a 
few days a week if they were given monetary incentives by their company, such 
as extra pay, a discount on gasoline purchases or gift certificates. 
</P>
<P>
Other incentives that drew support were reserved parking spaces in the most 
desirable locations and free parking for car-poolers. Only 7% said they would 
consider switching if they had to start paying for parking that they now get 
free. 
</P>
<P>
More than 19% said they simply need help in finding partners. 
</P>
<P>
Commuter Transportation Services operates Commuter Computer under several state 
and local grants that are being used to encourage development of traffic 
management associations, which are employer organizations formed to combat 
traffic problems. It conducted the two-month survey and provided 
recommendations on implementing a ride-sharing program at no cost to the 
transportation association. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale association, a consortium of public and private employers, 
incorporated in October and has been awarded a $60,000 state grant to initiate 
a program to persuade lone commuters to get out of the driver's seat and to 
either walk, ride with others or pedal bicycles to work, said Tom Horne, city 
traffic and transit administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Association members include the city of Glendale and 17 other major employers, 
including Security Pacific Automation, Walt Disney Imagineering, Fidelity 
Federal, Glendale Federal Bank and the Glendale Galleria. 
</P>
<P>
At the association's meeting last Thursday, Redfern urged that the group take 
an active role in transportation issues at the local and state level. "With the 
names of the companies you have in this association, you have a lot of clout," 
Redfern said. "You need to get into an advocacy role." 
</P>
<P>
She suggested, for example, that the group could press for building code 
amendments that reduce the number of parking spaces required at new office 
buildings, forcing more employees to share rides to work by making it more 
difficult to find parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale association is one of about 50 cooperative groups that have formed 
nationwide in recent years -- partnerships between business and local 
government to help solve transportation problems associated with rapid urban 
growth, according to the Urban Transportation Monitor, a trade journal. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale group plans to mail letters within a few weeks to executives of 
several dozen other major employers, inviting them to take part. The cost of 
membership has not been determined, and an executive director must still be 
hired. 
</P>
<P>
However, all companies with 100 or more employees have been ordered by the 
South Coast Air Quality Management Board to submit plans by January to 
encourage ride-sharing among employees. More than half of the plans submitted 
to date have been rejected as inadequate, according to AQMD officials. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale association members hope to meet the stringent air quality standards 
by working together. Companies that fall short of the rules face potentially 
stiff fines, Redfern said. 
</P>
<P>
The next meeting of the association is 3 p.m. Jan. 18 at Glendale Federal Bank, 
401 N. Brand Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
GETTING TO WORK 
</P>
<P>
Workers were recently asked how they traveled to their jobs in Glendale. 
Responding to the survey were 5,092 employees.

SPECTRUM BROADENS AMONG ELITE TEAM'S REPRESENTATIVES; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: PERENNIAL POWERS DOMINATE SELECTIONS, BUT, IN BIRMINGHAM, GRANT AND 
VAN NUYS, THEY HAVE COMPANY FROM SCHOOLS IN UNFAMILIAR TERRITORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At first glance, The Times' 1989 All-Valley high school football team follows a 
pattern. The area's traditionally strong teams again dominate the selections. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills High, the only Valley school to win a City Section 4-A Division 
championship since 1975, placed three players on the first team along with 
Notre Dame, one of the area's oldest private schools. And Canyon and Hart, 
perennial Southern Section powers, each placed two. In addition, Kennedy had 
two selections on the 23-player first team. 
</P>
<P>
But a closer look reveals a subtle shift in power to previously weaker 
programs. For the first time in five years, City 3-A schools Birmingham, Grant 
and Van Nuys are represented on the first team, a reflection of their 
surprising success. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Montclair Prep, which plays in Division IX, the lowest level of 
competition among Southern Section teams, was represented for the first time 
since 1985 when Rich Swinton, who now plays at Washington State, was a 
first-team selection. 
</P>
<P>
Mountie running back Derek Sparks, the area's leading rusher with 1,944 yards, 
is joined on the team by Birmingham quarterback-defensive back Danny Larson, 
Grant quarterback-defensive back Marlowe Lewis and Van Nuys lineman Edvin 
Babayova. 
</P>
<P>
Babayova and Lewis led their teams to league titles; Babayova earned a share of 
the Mid-Valley League MVP and Lewis claimed co-MVP honors in the East Valley. 
Babayova, a dominant lineman on both sides of the ball, symbolized the Van Nuys 
season, leading a team with no skill-position stars to a 5-2 league record (5-5 
overall). 
</P>
<P>
Grant was the surprise team of the area. The Lancers started the season with 
seven consecutive wins, including a stunning 40-13 victory over traditional 
power Reseda, and finished with a 9-2 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Birmingham rekindled memories of its glory years in the 1970s with a 
respectable 5-3-1 record, and Larson led Valley City passers with 1,445 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The team comprises 16 seniors and seven juniors. Canyon tailback Chris Peery is 
the only repeat selection, but he skipped a year. 
</P>
<P>
Peery was an All-Valley selection two seasons ago when he also was named state 
sophomore player of the year by Cal-Hi Sports. 
</P>
<P>
First-team players and their coaches and parents are invited to The Times' 
football awards brunch, scheduled for 9 a.m. Sunday at the Anaheim Hilton. The 
winners of awards for coach of the year, back of the year and lineman of the 
year will be announced.

4 SENIOR BACKS RUN AWAY WITH HONORS ON SOUTHEAST TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Four outstanding running backs -- Ivan Wilson of South Gate, Charles Levy of 
Lynwood, Ron Papazian of Whittier Christian and Rudy Ramirez of Bell Gardens -- 
head the 1989 Times Southeast All-Star High School Football Team. 
</P>
<P>
Together, those four seniors ran for more than 4,000 yards this season. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier High, which won its first league title in more than 20 years, placed 
four players on the first team. South Gate and El Rancho each have three 
players on the team. 
</P>
<P>
First-team players from throughout Southern California will be honored at a 
breakfast and awards ceremony at 9 a.m. Sunday at the Anaheim Hilton, 777 
Convention Way. The featured speaker will be Stanford football Coach Dennis 
Green. 
</P>
<P>
The All-Southeast team: 
</P>
<P>
OFFENSE 
</P>
<P>
Memo Watkins, Bell Gardens, lineman -- "The finest pulling guard we have had in 
years," Bell Gardens Coach Dave Newell said of the 5-foot-11, 255-pound 
Watkins, who has good speed and a low center of gravity. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Andresen, Warren, lineman -- "He has the size, strength and determination 
to be successful," Warren Coach John Hennigan said of the 6-foot-4, 295-pound 
Andresen. Despite missing some games due to an injury, he repeated on the 
All-Southeast team. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Brown, Santa Fe, lineman -- A three-year starter, Brown is quick and 
strong at 230 pounds. He had 46 tackles, three sacks and two forced fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Rodriguez, Glenn, lineman -- A three-year letterman, the 6-foot-2, 
285-pound Rodriguez was the best blocker on Glenn's Suburban League 
championship team. As a center, he dominated an opponent's defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Rodts, Whittier, lineman -- A 270-pound senior guard, Rodts was the 
Whitmont League's most valuable offensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Maldonado, Montebello, quarterback -- The Whitmont League's offensive back 
of the year, Maldonado completed 113 of 189 passes for 1,579 yards and 15 TDs. 
He was the Oilers' captain. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Levy, Lynwood, back -- This 6-foot-2, 185-pound senior played in only 
six games but still ran for 584 yards, passed for 466 and returned kicks for 
238 yards. Levy had 4,935 total yards in his career. Many big colleges are 
recruiting Levy, who also plays basketball at Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Papazian, Whittier Christian, back -- This 6-foot-2, 220-pound senior, who 
is being recruited by USC, UCLA and Colorado, scored 35 touchdowns and gained 
1,475 yards on 226 carries. As a linebacker, he led the Olympic League in 
tackles. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Ramirez, Bell Gardens, back -- Only 5-foot-6 and 145 pounds, Ramirez had 
1,100 yards rushing and 475 yards receiving. He also set a school record by 
returning four punts for TDs. He was All-CIF in 1988 and is a repeater on The 
Times' team. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Wilson, South Gate, back -- "He scares everyone he plays," South Gate 
Coach Gary Cordray said of Wilson, a powerful runner who gained 1,290 yards and 
scored 19 TDs. Cordray said Wilson reminds him of former Chicago Bears runner 
Walter Payton. USC and Washington are among the schools recruiting Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Alvarez, California, wide receiver -- The 6-foot, 170-pound Alvarez used 
a great ability to focus on the ball while being tightly covered to catch 62 
passes for 750 yards and four TDs. Coach Tom Tereschuk said Alvarez is very 
disciplined in running patterns, has great hands and the ability to find the 
open field. 
</P>
<P>
Jessie Carrillo, El Rancho, kicker -- Last year's leading kicker in Southern 
California, Carrillo made 22 of 23 extra points and hit five of eight in field 
goals this season. His kicks won two overtime games. 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
Chris Emch, Whittier, lineman -- He was Whittier's defensive player of the game 
four times this season. He led the Cardinals in tackles for three years and 
used his 6-foot-8 height to block nine extra-point attempts, three field-goal 
attempts and two punts. 
</P>
<P>
Puna Peko, Whittier, lineman -- Peko moves up after making the All-Southeast 
second team last season. The 6-foot-2, 270-pound senior was the Whitmont 
League's most valuable defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Garcia, El Rancho, lineman -- At 5-foot-11 and 250 pounds, Garcia can 
bench-press 340 pounds. Because of his strength, he seldom was successfully 
blocked. He made the Whitmont League first team on offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cardona, La Mirada, lineman -- This 6-foot-4, 275-pound college prospect 
also made the All-Suburban League team. 
</P>
<P>
Kali Williams, Lynwood, linebacker -- Joe Hembrick, who coached Williams, said 
that Williams is "beyond his years in maturity." A three-year starter who also 
played running back, Williams was a sure tackler and the leader of the Knights' 
defense. The University of the Pacific is interested in Williams, but he is 
leaning toward attending Howard University. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Ozuna, El Rancho, linebacker -- "He has great instincts and does things 
you can't coach," El Rancho Coach Dick Shelko said of Ozuna, who had 66 tackles 
and also starred as a running back. 
</P>
<P>
Valentino Hanks, South Gate, linebacker -- An all-around athlete, Hanks led the 
Rams in tackles and also averaged 29 yards on kickoff returns and 13 yards on 
punt returns. He reads defenses very well. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Carter, Glenn, back -- Willie Norman, Glenn's coach, said Carter has the 
"ability to find the football and the end zone." The 6-foot, 170-pound senior 
had six interceptions, returning two for TDs. He also starred as a kick 
returner and wide receiver. He made the Suburban League's first team on offense 
and defense. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Stafford, Norwalk, back -- A junior, Stafford had seven interceptions, 
returning one for a TD. He also returned two kicks for touchdowns. Stafford 
played "center field" on defense and also excelled in man-to-man coverage. As a 
wide receiver, he caught 27 passes for 625 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Cortez, Montebello, back -- A 6-foot, 180-pound senior, Cortez had 33 
tackles and two interceptions as a defensive back and also caught 28 passes for 
777 yards as an All-Whitmont League wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Martinez, South Gate, back -- South Gate's captain, Martinez made 50 
tackles and always covered the other team's best receiver. He also played 
quarterback and was on special teams. He ran for a first down on a fourth-down 
play in two big games.

Photo, PREP ALL-STARS: This year's edition of The Times' Southeast All-Star 
High School Football Team is headlined by outstanding running backs from four 
area high schools: South Gate, Lynwood, Bell Gardens and Whittier Christian. 
Players on the first and second teams were announced today and will be honored 
at a brunch Sunday in Anaheim. ; Photo, Even when the Gahr High School defense 
was knocked down it held on, which was representative of Gahr's surprisingly 
successful season. In this fourth-quarter action, Danny Donisthorpe of Gahr, on 
ground, doesn't let go of Warren High's runner Derrick Brown. BARRETT STINSON /
