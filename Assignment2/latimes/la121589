INS STUDIES PLAN LIMITING IMMIGRANTS' WORK AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

In an effort to keep immigrants seeking asylum from clustering in a few areas 
of the country, the government is considering the legality of issuing work 
visas limiting where they may be employed, the country's top immigration 
official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The aim is to keep already overburdened cities, including many in California, 
from acting as an "economic magnet" to immigrants whose asylum applications are 
being processed, Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Gene 
McNary told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"We're exploring, at the present time, the legal authority to issue work 
permits on a geographical basis, which is to say that if somebody gets a work 
permit it may not be (valid) anywhere in the United States," he said. "It may 
exclude Miami or San Diego or areas that are overwhelmed at the present time." 
</P>
<P>
While McNary specifically mentioned San Diego, INS officials there say that 
relatively few people -- normally fewer than 100 a month -- apply for asylum in 
the area. That number jumped recently because of an influx of Guatemalans, but 
the numbers have been declining recently, said Rudy Murillo, an INS spokesman 
in San Diego. Most seekers of asylum, generally from Central America, pass 
through the region en route to Los Angeles and other immigrant job centers, 
Murillo said. 
</P>
<P>
"We just don't get that many asylum applicants," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McNary, who took office last month, said he has asked INS lawyers if the idea 
would be legal and whether legislation would be necessary to implement it. 
"They may find that it's impossible," he said. "But something should be 
possible, even if legislation is necessary. It makes sense to me." 
</P>
<P>
Local and state officials -- most notably in California, Florida and Texas, 
where immigrant groups are more likely to settle -- have complained to federal 
authorities that the expanding influx of immigrants in their communities has 
placed an unfair burden on their citizens' ability to pay for social services 
used by the immigrants. In the closing months of the Ronald Reagan 
Administration, federal officials detained Nicaraguan and other immigrants 
claiming asylum in an effort to dissuade others from following them to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy, if implemented, would affect only immigrants who are claiming 
asylum based on persecution in their home countries, a process that may take a 
year or more to resolve. Duke Austin, senior press spokesman at the INS, said 
that about 100,000 people would be affected annually if the idea were 
implemented. He said that INS officials haven't proposed any contingency plans 
to implement the idea. "We just haven't gotten that far on this yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While many immigration experts and officials of immigrant rights organizations 
strongly objected to the detention policy, they were reluctant to offer an 
opinion on McNary's proposal because it has not been formally announced. But 
some said the idea seemed unlikely to be practical, noting enforcement 
difficulties and the legality of limiting immigrants' freedom of travel. 
</P>
<P>
Francisco Garcia, director of immigration rights programs for the Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), said in Los Angeles that 
he welcomed the idea of moving away from the detention policy, but found 
problems with the idea of forcing immigrants to live in pre-selected places. 
</P>
<P>
"We very firmly believe that anyone in the process of adjusting their status to 
live in this country should be entitled to an automatic work authorization," he 
said. "But we should let the market dictate where people should work and live. 
I have grave concerns that this would prevent the free movement of people." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores said that, while she had not 
seen the proposal and thus could not evaluate it specifically, she felt the 
idea of directing the immigrants to areas where more work seemed to be 
available for them "might be beneficial . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"I'm talking about areas where there are more jobs than people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Henderson, an official with the American Civil Liberties Union in 
Washington, said that McNary's idea deserves study. But Henderson said his fear 
is that it would have "a troubling dimension. It could lead to potential 
restrictions on the right to travel, which would be a violation of their civil 
liberties." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Higgins, executive director of the Immigration Reform Law Institute, a 
Washington-based public-interest law firm that seeks to reduce the levels of 
U.S. immigration, said he doubted it would be possible to enforce such a 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
"On the practical level, I don't see how you could enforce residence," he said. 
"If a person is sent to Omaha, how could you stop him from moving a week later 
to Miami? I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Higgins said he saw merits in the idea because immigrants shouldn't be huddled 
in one place, causing an unfair burden on a city's social services. "But we're 
set up as a country not to enforce residence status," he said. "We don't have 
an internal passport system like the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, immigration officials encouraged agencies resettling a flood of 
Vietnamese and Cambodians to find sponsors around the country willing to find 
jobs and apartments for the refugees. The voluntary plan, which was intended to 
distribute the impact of resettlement to all the states, often faltered as 
refugees left their original sponsors to seek warm weather and a community of 
their fellow countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
McNary said that he had recently visited Miami and had seen that city coping 
with a large illegal alien population from Central America. He said that the 
medical, educational and other social services accept all the Nicaraguans. 
</P>
<P>
"In Miami, if there is anything bigger than their brain, it's their heart," he 
said. "They don't turn anyone away. Instead of saying, 'We don't want any more 
Nicaraguans in Miami,' they say, 'We want them all to have work permits.' " 
</P>
<P>
He said he met with Florida's two senators and community leaders who thought 
the work permit idea could be worked out as a solution to the problem. "We want 
to tell some people you can't just go to Miami or San Diego . . . you can work 
in some other part of the United States," McNary said. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to McNary's comments, Miami Mayor Xavier L. Suarez said in a 
prepared statement that he appreciated the commissioner's willingness to help 
his and other cities.

Huang Zhen, 80, a former Chinese envoy to the United States who helped plan the 
historic 1972 visit of President Richard M. Nixon. A native of eastern Anhui 
province who joined the Red Army in 1931 and the Communist Party in 1932, Huang 
was also a former minister of culture and ambassador to France, Hungary and 
Indonesia. Huang was ambassador to France from 1964 to 1973, although he was 
suspended from his post from 1967-69 while being criticized by leftist radicals 
during the Cultural Revolution. His official biography said Huang met with 
then-Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger to prepare Nixon's February, 1972, 
visit, which began the process of warmer U.S.-Chinese ties that led to the 
establishment of full diplomatic relations in 1979. From 1973 to 1977, Huang 
headed China's liaison office in the United States. He also served as president

SEA WORLD WHALE FIGHTS DEADLY ILLNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of Sea World's two adult killer whales has developed a rare fungal 
infection that is usually fatal, but veterinarians at the marine park 
cautiously expressed hope Thursday that an experimental drug will save its 
life. 
</P>
<P>
This week, park doctors say, Knootka, an 8,500-pound killer whale in her late 
20s, has become the first whale to receive itraconazole, an experimental drug 
that is approved for human use in Europe. Sea World has received special 
permission from the federal Food and Drug Administration to administer the 
drug, which park doctors believe is the most effective of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, systemic fungal infections have been fatal. That's what we're up 
against," said Sea World veterinarian Jim McBain. "But historically, there 
hasn't been a drug like this. Maybe we're entering a new era, or maybe we 
aren't. We're trying to be optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
Dan LeBlanc, the Sea World spokesman, concurred. "She could live an hour, she 
could live five more years," he said. "We just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
If Knootka were to die, she would be the third killer whale to die at Sea World 
since Baby Shamu was born last year. In August, 1988, just three days after the 
birth, the baby's father, Orky, died of natural causes brought on by old age, 
the park said. At about 30, Orky was the oldest killer whale in captivity at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last August, Baby Shamu's mother, 14-year-old Kandu, died in a freak 
injury caused when she attempted to dominate another female whale, Corky, 
during a performance. Since then, Corky has become a surrogate mother to Baby 
Shamu, also known as Orkid. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, keepers noticed that Knootka was lethargic and was shunning food. 
When blood samples revealed a high level of white blood cells, indicating 
infection, park doctors began to administer antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, when Knootka had not improved, McBain sent another blood sample to a 
laboratory in Oklahoma that specializes in the study of mycosis, or diseases 
caused by parasitic fungi. No sooner had that test come back positive than 
marine keepers noticed a small growth on Knootka's tongue. Technicians tested 
the growth and found it to be fungus. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears to be confirming our worst dreams," said McBain, adding that he 
believes the systemic fungal infection took hold because Knootka's immune 
system is weakening with age. According to McBain, female killer whales can 
live up to 40 years, while males generally live until age 30. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Watson, founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a marine mammal 
conservation group, disagreed with McBain's life-expectancy estimates and said 
he believes Knootka's captivity, not her age, caused the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The killer whale in the wild can live 60 or 70 years -- very comparable to a 
human. This one is not old," he said. "Life span in captivity is severely 
reduced because of the capture, the stress of living in a confined space, the 
unsanitary conditions. If you go through the statistics of the whales or 
dolphins that have died in captivity, most are due to infections." 
</P>
<P>
Other whale experts disputed Watson's views. 
</P>
<P>
"That's pure speculation on their part," said Dennis Kelly, a marine biology 
professor at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, who said the "age-question 
controversy" is being hotly debated. "Marine parks are a necessity. We are so 
ignorant of marine mammals that their only hope is that people will go to parks 
and become highly motivated to work for conservation of marine habitats." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Laurie Gage, the veterinarian at Marine World Africa USA in Vallejo and at 
the California Marine Mammal Center, a rehabilitation and release center for 
recovered animals, said, "People are ready to attack animals in captivity, but 
I'm sure animals in the wild have this same problem, and they don't get any 
care." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, McBain said, fungal infections of the type Knootka has contracted have 
been reported in the wild. He said they may be more common in marine parks 
because, in the wild, a sickly animal would die of a bacterial infection before 
it could develop the slower-acting fungal infection. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Knootka is convalescing in a pool of her own, while Corky and Orkid 
swim in another pool nearby. Doctors say the internal infection poses no danger 
to the other whales, but Knootka has been kept separate from the thriving 
1,100-pound baby because she has no experience caring for young whales. 
</P>
<P>
Twice a day, Knootka ingests 100 pink and blue capsules of itraconazole, which 
keepers craftily hide inside herring. Even with 50 times the daily human dose 
of the drug, McBain said, progress is likely to be slow. 
</P>
<P>
"Realistically, we won't know how we're doing until we're done," he said. 
"There are not enough of these cases around to compare." 
</P>
<P>
As much as possible, McBain said, keepers are preserving Knootka's normal daily 
routine. Up to eight times a day, they conduct regular training sessions, 
playing with her fins and blowing bubbles in the water. Never a consistent part 
of Sea World's twice-daily whale performances, Knootka has recently dropped out 
of the shows altogether. But, if she indicates she wants to perform in Shamu 
Stadium, McBain said, keepers will allow it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be a good sign," he said. "She needs to have a reason to feel 
better, and that kind of activity might be it." 
</P>
<P>
McBain added that, once word of Knootka's illness gets out, he is expecting the 
usual helpful get-well hints from animal lovers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have a thousand phone calls about giving yogurt to the whale, 
or vinegar and water," he said, laughing. "They're well-meaning, but we'd like 
to assure them we've got the best treatment going." 
</P>
<P>
Still, officials at the marine park have braced for the possibility of 
Knootka's death. One of the 12 killer whales in Sea World's three other parks 
might be moved to San Diego to replace Knootka if needed, they said. And so 
far, they have only purchased enough of the Belgian-made anti-fungal drug to 
last 30 days -- about $6,000 worth. 
</P>
<P>
"If we still have Knootka in two weeks, we'll continue to get more," McBain 
said. "Even under the best of circumstances, there are no guarantees."

BILBRAY SAYS MIRAMAR'S FATE NOT UP TO NAVY; 
</P>
<P>
AVIATION: THE COUNTY SUPERVISOR AND NAVY OFFICIALS EXCHANGED HEATED WORDS AT A 
MEETING ON ALTERNATIVE AIRPORT SITES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
In some of the most heated discussion yet over whether a new regional airport 
should be located at Miramar Naval Air Station, County Supervisor Brian Bilbray 
told Navy officials Thursday that the final decision will be made by civilians 
and not the military, which vehemently opposes moving from Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
"The Navy doesn't decide. . . . This is a civilian government, and Congress is 
the one that has the final say. It's Congress that controls the budget and 
controls base closings," Bilbray said. He added that, unlike the San Diego of 
the 1960s, the community in the '90s and in the next century won't "be 
dependent on every military" installation staying in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray made his comments at a meeting held by a San Diego Assn. of Governments 
policy advisory committee to discuss the results of a new $385,000 study that 
analyzed three airport sites as alternatives to congested Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
The report, released earlier this week, concludes that all three locations -- 
Otay Mesa, Miramar and a site east of the naval air station -- are technically 
superior to Lindbergh Field in that they can accommodate the region's annual 40 
million airline passengers expected by the middle of the next century. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has said it will not give up Miramar -- home of the well-known "Top 
Gun" fighter pilot school -- because it considers the base crucial to the 
training of pilots who must land on aircraft carriers. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the answer to airport (relocation) . . . the answer doesn't rest with 
the Navy or the military structure," Bilbray said. "It will be a political 
decision made by the Armed Services Committee" of Congress, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Navy doesn't have veto power over our elected officials. . . . The fact 
is, (Miramar) is the only option, and we all ought to be frank about it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray's comments brought a retort from Capt. Thomas R. Mitchell, the Navy's 
official representative on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that the budget comes from Congress . . . but (we spend) our 
budget pretty much how we please," Mitchell said. "You don't start at the top" 
in making cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people have the understanding of how this goes. . . . You can 
keep revisiting (the Miramar option) all you want . . . (but) if you think the 
will of San Diego will override the will of the country, I think you're 
mistaken," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Replied Bilbray: "You're the country?" 
</P>
<P>
A Navy captain at Thursday's meeting called the air station the Navy's best and 
possibly the best in all the military. The Navy estimates it would cost at 
least $8 billion to replace the sprawling facility of almost 24,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray, who said his father was a Navy pilot, as is his brother, maintains 
that Miramar is the region's only realistic choice as a long-term solution to 
crowding at Lindbergh, in part because pending residential and industrial 
development on Otay Mesa precludes the construction of a large airport at Brown 
Field there. 
</P>
<P>
"How long will we be diverted from biting the bullet?" Bilbray asked the 
committee, of which he is a member. "It really comes down to one option." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Larry Pearson, Miramar's commanding officer, forcefully made the case for 
the Navy staying at Miramar. He said that, unlike other military air bases that 
share facilities with civilian airliners, Miramar trains fighter pilots and 
others to land on aircraft carriers, and the base's runways are outfitted with 
special arresting gears. 
</P>
<P>
As part of training pilots for carrier landings, the Navy practices constant 
touch-and-go landings requiring steep takeoffs and sharp turns, procedures that 
would make mingling with civilian airliners dangerous and would impinge on Navy 
operations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pearson, who used a slide show to get his points across, also said that, 
because of global conflicts, there will be more, not less, pressure to use 
aircraft carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Those who want to use Miramar have argued that the Navy can move its operations 
to El Centro in the Imperial Valley, where it also trains pilots and conducts 
10% of its operations. But Pearson said the desert town is too small and not 
capable of accommodating Miramar's 37,000 people, including the military, 
civilians and their dependents. 
</P>
<P>
"The infrastructure just does not exist. Where will families dependent on two 
incomes find comparable employment?" Pearson asked. 
</P>
<P>
He detailed other reasons against El Centro, including longer flying times and 
more fuel consumption. Pearson painted a scenario in which young pilots 
undergoing carrier-landing training might get only one chance at landing on a 
carrier located off-shore and then be forced to leave the scene to get more 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
"If they have to go over the hill, they might have one look at the flight deck 
and" then they'd be gone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Bilbray said he had talked to pilots, "the people who fly the missions," 
and they aren't as concerned about losing Miramar as Pearson and other top Navy 
officials claim. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray noted that, during the last round of base closings approved by 
Congress, neither the Navy nor the Marine Corps was hit hard, but that things 
may be different as Congress looks at making more cutbacks in the military's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray said San Diego was much more dependent on the Navy in the 1960s, when 
questions were raised then about using Miramar as San Diego's major civilian 
airport. But San Diego is different now, he said, and moving an installation 
the size of Miramar won't harm the city in the '90s or into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego City Councilman Ron Roberts said that he found the Navy's argument 
compelling, that he too had talked to rank-and-file Miramar pilots and that 
they had told him the Navy's position is correct. Roberts, who has pushed for a 
dual-use regional airport split between Brown Field and Lindbergh, said it is 
clear the Navy won't move from Miramar or share it with civilian planes. 
</P>
<P>
That brought a response from Councilman Bob Filner, who said the committee is 
relying on information from only "one side." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think a propaganda approach from one agency (the Navy) is going to 
convince me?" Filner asked. 
</P>
<P>
Among other items in the 175-page report discussed at the meeting was that the 
cost of building an airport at East Miramar, estimated at $3.1 billion, 
excluding $276 million for road construction, might be so high as to put the 
site "out of consideration," according to Dan G. Haney, a senior manager for 
KPMG Peat Marwick, the consulting firm that helped prepare the report. 
</P>
<P>
The report also says that one way of financing a new airport is to redevelop 
Lindbergh Field with offices, hotels, retail stores and industrial buildings 
and use tax money generated from the development to pay for the airport. The 
report estimated that the San Diego Unified Port District could earn as much as 
$572 million a year from such a project. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Port District called that figure as much too high, perhaps by a 
factor of 10. An economist with the San Diego Assn. of Governments said the 
estimate is based on gross revenues and not net revenues, as the Port District 
calculated. 
</P>
<P>
The report will be considered today by Sandag's board of directors.

'THIS BAN'S FOR YOU' BRINGS CHEERS, JEERS AT BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kurt Burris was standing on the sand at Ocean Beach, holding a beer in his 
hand. When he heard that drinking on the beach might be illegal as early as 
next month, he grimaced. He said, "You're kidding." 
</P>
<P>
"This ban's for you" is one piece of legislation Burris can do without. But 
it's true: The San Diego City Council will soon be voting on a total ban on 
alcohol at city parks and beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't like it at all -- in fact, I would hate it," said Burris, 30, who 
lives in Pacific Beach. "They passed a law saying you can't drink beer on the 
beach after 10 (p.m.), and that didn't stop anybody. This won't either. When 
will they learn? This won't stop people from drinking. If that's the goal, they 
better try another route." 
</P>
<P>
J. J. Cihouski, who, with his wife, Nora, lives in a stately home on Sunset 
Cliffs Boulevard in Ocean Beach, favors the ban -- unequivocally, passionately 
-- but agrees with Burris that it probably won't make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to drink no matter what," Cihouski said, "and, they're going 
to make noise and cause problems. Still, I think it's a good idea, and I'm very 
much in favor of it." 
</P>
<P>
Cihouski's viewpoint was echoed by other beachfront homeowners interviewed 
Thursday in Ocean Beach, whereas Burris' views summed up the feelings of most 
beach-goers. One liquor store owner dependent on the business of beach lovers 
was adamantly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
Just about everyone interviewed had heard about the vote taken by a City 
Council committee, which recommended -- unanimously -- that alcohol be banned 
year-round at all city beaches and parks. 
</P>
<P>
The vote, by the five members of the Public Facilities and Recreation 
Committee, suggests that there is enough council support for passage when the 
issue comes before the nine-member council, probably next month. 
</P>
<P>
The ban is aimed at complaints of public drunkenness, crime and noise that have 
come from representatives of beach communities in recent years. As a beachfront 
homeowner, Nora Cihouski is one of those who feels the ban should have come 
sooner. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember this one evening, I guess it was 7 o'clock, when we heard this man 
screaming at the top of his lungs," she said. "He was threatening to jump off 
the cliff, and he was falling-down drunk. We have trouble with rowdyism and 
crowds on occasion, especially in the summer. I don't think a ban will solve 
the problem, but it has to help." 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the proposed ban was swift at most City Council offices Thursday 
afternoon. A spokeswoman for Councilman Ron Roberts, whose district includes 
Ocean Beach, said Roberts' office received 17 calls Thursday from people 
inquiring about the ban (some for it, others opposed). A spokeswoman for 
Councilman Bruce Henderson, whose district includes Mission Beach and Pacific 
Beach, said Henderson's office received about 12 calls. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Smith, 38, a massage therapist who lives in Mission Hills, comes to the 
beach three to four times a week to play volleyball. Like many of those 
interviewed Thursday, he sees the sins of a few as having "ruined a good thing" 
for many. 
</P>
<P>
"I really hate to see it happen here in Ocean Beach," Smith said, "because OB 
has done a lot to clean itself up. The area has really improved. I think the 
majority of people who come here, volleyball players and surfers especially, 
are responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"If they do ban it, here's what will happen -- 20% of the people will stop 
drinking at the beach, and the other 80% will figure out a way to sneak it in." 
</P>
<P>
Duff Patterson, 33, who lives in Point Loma, said the ban on booze at the beach 
is further evidence that San Diego is now very much a big city. He, for one, 
reacts to that with sadness. 
</P>
<P>
"I lived in L.A. for four years, and, as you know, they have it banned on the 
beaches up there," Patterson said. "The area between the border and Solana 
Beach has been about the only part of Southern California where you could drink 
on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Patterson remembers nights as a kid going to Point Loma High School when he and 
his buddies could gather around a bonfire at Ocean Beach and "stay up all 
night, drinkin' and talkin.' We didn't bother anybody, and they didn't bother 
us." 
</P>
<P>
"What happened is a lot of East County gang types started showing up at the 
beaches, ruining it for everybody. Legislation won't stop it, but they've tried 
everything else, so now, they've got to try that. I think the ban was 
inevitable; it's just sad it had to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Fejfar, 22, a Navy man from South Dakota, and Nebraskan Paula Heine, 20, 
both of El Cajon, said one of their happiest memories is the first time they 
ever saw a California beach at sunset, an event they celebrated at Ocean Beach 
with a glass of champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Sims, 31, a corrections officer from Spring Valley, was at the beach 
Thursday afternoon with his 4-year-old son. He's all for the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people would be against it until something happened to one of their 
kids, and then, they'll be for it too," Sims said. 
</P>
<P>
A lifeguard, who asked not to be quoted by name, said he is for it -- 
enthusiastically so. 
</P>
<P>
"Eighty percent of the rescues out here are alcohol-related," he said. "Last 
summer, a drunk Navy guy was out here surfing. He almost drowned, only because 
he was so damn drunk. It's getting worse and worse each year. 
</P>
<P>
"I also don't think it's going to be hard to enforce. We give out $65 tickets 
for people drinking from bottles, or drinking after 10 p.m., and that's seemed 
to work. I can't wait to start cracking down on the ban." 
</P>
<P>
Patrokolas Demaggio, who owns Pat's Liquor Store, just a beer-can's throw from 
the water at Ocean Beach, said he bitterly resents the ban because it may 
destroy his business. 
</P>
<P>
"The Navy guys buy heavy and then take it down the beach," said Demaggio, 
puffing a thick cigar. "It won't close me down, at least not right away, but it 
will hurt. I'm dependent on business from people who drink at the beach. But 
then, nobody listens to me anyway."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: UP AGAINST A BERLIN WALL IN SEARCH FOR THE FACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Christmas comes to San Diego. Or: Ich bin ein consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly Santa is everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
In Mission Beach, Santa rides a 10-speed and wears cutoffs. In Encinitas, Santa 
appears at a Ralphs store and gets a Brie break every hour. 
</P>
<P>
In Del Mar, Santa rides a red Kawasaki. He's a land appraiser delivering 
presents to real estate firms. 
</P>
<P>
I am at May Co. in Mission Valley. I have come to check on sales for a 
late-starting novelty: 1-ounce chunks of the Berlin Wall, $10 each, complete 
with tiny pouch and declaration of authenticity. 
</P>
<P>
The store is thick with shoppers. I hear the rocks before I see them. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, Gloria, there they are," Amy Sherwood, 76, who lives in Santee, says to 
her friend and neighbor Gloria Atkinson, 63. "It's a rock of history." 
</P>
<P>
Sherwood and Atkinson look but do not buy. Sherwood drifts off to inspect a 
Euroshaver with vibrating twin blades for her grandson, a Carlsbad contractor. 
</P>
<P>
That's common. What was once the coldest symbol of a divided Europe is now a 
come-hither item, luring shoppers who end up buying ties and bulky-knit 
sweaters and ski goggles. 
</P>
<P>
Marydell McQuillen, 37, office manager for a computer firm in Kearny Mesa, buys 
a rock for her husband. She bought one last week for her brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
"It's truly for the person who has everything," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
I ask a clerk how many rocks have been sold. I have bumbled into Checkpoint 
Charlie. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll have to talk to corporate headquarters in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
I sneak away and ask another clerk. This time I do not offer name, rank and 
affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
"Sales are good." 
</P>
<P>
"Who's buying the rocks?" 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly just average people." 
</P>
<P>
The clerk thereby fulfills the first rule of Christmas retailing: Give the 
reporter what he wants. 
</P>
<P>
Keep Reading . . . 
</P>
<P>
Here's some more. 
</P>
<P>
* Sagon Penn has changed his name, resumed his martial arts career and broken 
up with the woman who gave birth to his child. 
</P>
<P>
He also danced briefly with a male go-go group at Saxx, a nightclub in 
Southeast San Diego. G-strings only. 
</P>
<P>
* I said a Bush Light. 
</P>
<P>
The Volunteer Project, a nonprofit group that recruits and trains volunteers 
for social service projects throughout San Diego, has received a Point of Light 
award for community service from the President. 
</P>
<P>
* Libertarians don't win many elections, but they do have fun. 
</P>
<P>
Take Dennis Thompson, owner of a San Diego computer firm who is running for 
governor as a Libertarian. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson doesn't like Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp's proposal to tax candy. So 
he sent Van de Kamp a box of sourball candies to show his displeasure. No 
response yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably hear from his dentist," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Supremacy and 1st Amendment 
</P>
<P>
The Oregon chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is considering a 
request from Fallbrook white supremacist Tom Metzger for legal help in a damage 
suit filed against him in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
The suit claims Metzger's rhetoric incited three skinheads to beat an Ethiopian 
man to death in 1988. Metzger says the suit has a "chilling effect" on his 
First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was filed by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in New York 
and the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
Stevie Remington, executive director of the Oregon ACLU, says her group 
probably won't represent Metzger but might file a "friend of the court" brief 
in his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Remington is chagrined that news of Metzger's request leaked to Portland's 
Oregonian newspaper. She remembers how support for the ACLU nationwide dropped 
after it represented Nazis in Skokie, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
"We could take a hit again just like Skokie," Remington said. "But that 
shouldn't deter us: our client is the First Amendment, not Mr. Metzger."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SLAIN DRUG TRAFFICKER LINKED TO SYLMAR BUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A drug trafficker gunned down in Juarez earlier this month had ties to 
Colombia's Medellin drug cartel and was involved in a record cocaine bust in 
Sylmar, federal officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Roberto Najar, 28, was one of two men killed Dec. 1 in Juarez. 
Federal police commander Elias Ramirez said Najar was a close friend of accused 
Juarez drug lord Rafael Munoz, who is believed to have masterminded the 
shipment of 21.4 tons of cocaine seized Sept. 29 in Sylmar after being smuggled 
across the border from Juarez into Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Najar and another drug trafficker were killed in a gang-style slaying in Juarez 
in front of a home owned by a former federal officer. The other victim was 
identified as Najar's bodyguard, Oscar Rivera Nogeda, 38.

REPRIEVE IS GRANTED TO BELLY UP TAVERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Solana Beach residents complaining of headaches from live music at a 
neighborhood tavern will have to wait weeks -- possibly months -- for a 
solution to their problem, according to a state Alcoholic Beverage Control 
Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, ABC Director Jay Stroh rejected an administrative law judge's 
decision set down last month in the case of the popular Belly Up Tavern on 
South Cedros Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The judge had ruled that persistent noise problems from bands and rowdy patrons 
were sufficient cause to revoke the tavern's liquor license unless the owner 
agreed to conditions, including beefed-up security and possible building 
modifications, said Pete Case, an ABC administrator in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling stated that "it would be contrary to the public welfare and morals 
to allow the license to continue without the imposition of conditions," Case 
said. 
</P>
<P>
According to ABC guidelines, Stroh had 100 days to either follow the ruling or 
further consider the matter. On Thursday, he asked for written transcripts of a 
four-day public hearing into the case conducted in January. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if he found any fault with the judge's ruling," Case said of 
Stroh's decision. "But there might be some problems with the conditions. Maybe 
he didn't think they solved the problem overall." 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1988, two families living nearby the bar appealed to the ABC, claiming 
that noise from the bar and rowdy patrons created a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Hodges, who opened the 600-capacity tavern 15 years ago, has said that he 
could not afford to remain open if he were prohibited from featuring live music 
until 1 a.m. each night. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the complaints, he said he has taken several steps to keep the 
volume of the music down, has refused to book certain bands and may relocate 
some parking areas operated by the bar. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides have anxiously waited almost a year for some decision in the case. 
Stroh's announcement, however, effectively means the matter is still in limbo, 
Case said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still no winner, no loser," he said. "It's just another step in the 
process. It will be several weeks, if not months, before we decide this thing." 
</P>
<P>
Joan Higgins, a Belly Up neighbor who complained about the noise, said she is 
eager for some decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like it to be resolved either way," she said. "We never wanted to close 
down the Belly Up Tavern. Our only intention was to get a good night's sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Owner Dave Hodges said he was surprised at the judge's ruling and relieved that 
the ABC was taking another look at the case.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 16-YEAR-OLD CRITICALLY WOUNDED IN SHOOT-OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old boy was shot and critically wounded Thursday during a shooting in 
the Cadillac-Corning area of West Los Angeles that police said may have been 
gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
James Clements of Culver City was in extremely critical condition and on life 
support at Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Hollywood after being shot once in the 
head in the 2000 block of Corning Street shortly after midnight Wednesday, 
Detective Bill Humphry of the Los Angeles Police Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the shooting occurred after the driver of a car in which 
Clements was a passenger stopped to let out another passenger, and at least two 
men who were walking nearby opened fire into the vehicle. Another passenger, an 
unidentified 22-year-old man, was treated at another hospital for an arm wound 
and released. Police had no suspects Thursday.

POLICE OUTLINE 2ND SEPULVEDA BARRICADE ZONE TO STOP DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police officials and community leaders Thursday mapped out a plan 
to temporarily barricade a second Sepulveda neighborhood beset by drive-by drug 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which comes after police barricaded the nearby 12-square-block 
Columbus Avenue neighborhood last month to curtail narcotics traffic there, 
raises fresh questions about the effectiveness of cordoning off areas to fight 
drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, which would have to be approved by the City Council, a 
two-block section of Orion Avenue would be closed at Nordhoff and Parthenia 
streets by sawhorses that would be removed twice a day to allow 40 school buses 
from the local public school into the area. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is no organized opposition, critics have said the technique will 
simply push the narcotics trade into neighboring areas, forcing officials to 
set up an ever-escalating number of roadblocks. 
</P>
<P>
"If we start turning our cities into citadels by cutting off access to some 
streets, we will have diminished the basic rights of Americans in the name of 
fighting narcotics," said Abraham Abramovsky, a law professor at Fordham 
University in New York. "With the Berlin Wall going down in Europe, it seems 
rather ironic that walls are being erected around parts of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Police officials last month conceded that drug traffic had increased in the 
Orion Avenue neighborhood as a result of barricades thrown up around the 
12-square-block Columbus Avenue area, which is just four blocks west. But they 
said Orion Avenue already had an active drug trade and that closing it would 
not drive customers into single-family neighborhoods to the north and east 
because they would be too conspicuous there. 
</P>
<P>
"The buyers don't know where to go now, and our interest is to keep them off 
balance," said Capt. Mark D. Stevens, adding that police will continue to seize 
cars owned by drug buyers during undercover sweeps. Using federal forfeiture 
laws, police earlier this month seized 18 cars from cocaine buyers visiting a 
Canoga Park neighborhood and the Orion Avenue area. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said police will hold a public meeting in January to gauge residents' 
feelings about the proposed street closure. Thursday, he and other police 
officials met privately at the United Methodist Church in Sepulveda to discuss 
it with city transportation officials, firefighters and local school and church 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joel Wachs, who sent a representative to the meeting, said afterward 
that he will ask the City Council to approve the barricades on Orion Avenue 
early next year. Last month, the City Council approved the Columbus Avenue 
barricades at Wachs' request. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, residents of Orion Avenue would still be able to enter the 
neighborhood from Rayen Street. The barricades would be removed for 2 1/2-hour 
periods in the morning and afternoon to allow the 40 buses that pick up and 
drop off children at Langdon Avenue elementary school to continue using Orion 
Avenue, said Principal Dan Balderrama. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Kunz, a spokesman for Wachs, said drug buyers could conceivably enter 
Orion Avenue during periods when it is open to school buses, but they probably 
would not want to operate part time. 
</P>
<P>
Church and school officials at Thursday's meeting said they support the 
barricades, regardless of their impact elsewhere.

HUNTER DEFENSE REVEALS APPEAL STRATEGY IN COURT PAPERS URGING CLIENT'S RELEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Hoover Hunter, convicted earlier this week of federal tax evasion, has 14 
"solid" grounds for appeal, including the fact that her widely publicized trial 
was not moved out of San Diego, her lawyers argued in legal papers filed 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Urging a federal appeals court to release Hunter from jail pending formal 
sentencing, the lawyers argued that the "strength" of her appeal was just one 
of the reasons Hunter is no more of a risk to flee than she was before 
conviction Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers also claimed that it was "unfounded" to suggest that Hunter would 
flee, because she had been under indictment for more than three years but had 
not sought to leave the country permanently and sending her to jail during the 
holiday season is "cruel and smacks of punishment." 
</P>
<P>
"If Ms. Hunter were a flight risk, she would have departed . . . long before 
now," attorneys Robert Brewer and Richard Marmaro said in the brief, filed with 
the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The brief, in which the lawyers asked that Hunter be able to await her Feb. 20 
sentencing at home, essentially recounted the factors that failed to convince 
U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam that Hunter was not a flight risk. Gilliam 
sent Hunter to jail without bail immediately after her conviction on four of 
197 counts. 
</P>
<P>
However, the papers identified, apparently for the first time, the issues 
Hunter's defense team plans to attack when they file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Besides trial publicity, most of the 13 other grounds centered on errors that 
Gilliam, who presided over Hunter's eight-month trial, purportedly made, the 
attorneys said in the papers. 
</P>
<P>
The case against Hunter stemmed from her role as a top executive in the La 
Jolla investment firm J. David &amp; Co. from 1979 to 1984, when its checks 
began to bounce and nervous investors forced the firm to file for protection 
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
In all, investors lost about $80 million in the J. David affair, a giant Ponzi 
scheme in which prosecutors alleged that Hunter played an active role. The 
defense lawyers said Hunter was blinded by her love for the firm's founder, J. 
David (Jerry) Dominelli, and was unaware of any illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
The jury that convicted Hunter of the tax evasion counts also acquitted her of 
one other tax-related charge but deadlocked on the 192 counts that centered on 
her alleged involvement with the Ponzi scheme, a pyramid in which money from 
new investors is used to pay off earlier investors. 
</P>
<P>
The trial, which began March 28, is believed to be the longest-running criminal 
case in the history of the San Diego federal court. Hunter faces up to 20 years 
in prison, or five years on each of the counts. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam, Hunter's defense team said, could have moved the case out of San Diego 
to ensure a fair trial. And he could have sequestered the jury, should have 
dismissed a juror whom they said had outside contact during the trial, and 
should not have re-read jury instructions halfway through the panel's 
deliberations, the defense contended. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the lawyers maintained, Gilliam was too harsh in not allowing them 
to ask witnesses about certain issues, including Hunter's relationship with 
Dominelli. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers detailed several other technical mistakes they said Gilliam made 
and contended they brought up the "strength" of Hunter's appeal only because an 
appeals court may consider that in deciding whether someone is a flight risk. 
</P>
<P>
The attorneys also said that Hunter's conviction did not by itself make her so 
untrustworthy as to be kept locked up until her Feb. 20 sentencing. And the 
conviction was one of only two factors Gilliam discussed when ordering her to 
jail, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The other reason was Gilliam's statement that Hunter lied when she testified in 
October that she was innocent of related state charges, though she had entered 
a guilty plea in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
When Hunter said she agreed to the plea bargain because she didn't know if she 
had the energy to go through two trials, that wasn't lying, the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
Calling plea bargains a "fact of life in the judicial system," the attorneys 
said it was "difficult to understand" why Gilliam "refuses to accept the 
notion" that people sometimes plead guilty "to offenses they did not commit in 
order to end a case on relatively favorable terms." 
</P>
<P>
The 1986 deal -- in which Hunter admitted that she funneled money, allegedly J. 
David funds, to Roger Hedgecock's successful 1983 campaign for San Diego mayor 
-- brought Hunter fines and probation, but no jail time.

Nervous pageant contestants whisper among themselves as one woman walks to the 
microphone to answer questions from the judges. Radiant in flowing pink 
chiffon, she gives her best advice to young people today: 
</P>
<P>
"Get your education. Be honest. And do unto others as you wish to be done by. 
That's what my mother taught me when I was a child." 
</P>
<P>
For Mary Jane Rich and her fellow Carson pageant competitors, that was a long 
time ago. But it's what qualifies them for this new type of South Bay pageant, 
where senior citizens show that being young isn't everything. 
</P>
<P>
No tap dancing, juggling or opera singing under these spotlights. Audiences 
won't see a swimsuit all night. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the women -- and, in some rounds of the pageant, the men -- show 
examples of their best handicrafts, read original poetry, talk about their 
lives or just try to make the audience laugh. 
</P>
<P>
At the first of six preliminary rounds before the grand pageant in February, 
life experience won out. Carson Retirement Center's oldest contestant, 
84-year-old Estelle McGowan, took the tiara on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because you're a senior citizen doesn't mean you lose your talents," 
pageant coordinator Mary Lynn Ahsmuhs said. "You don't have to sing and dance 
to have a lot to offer." 
</P>
<P>
Ahsmuhs, a co-owner of the Beltone Hearing Aide Center in Torrance, said she 
recently moved to Los Angeles from Oklahoma, where retirement pageants are an 
elaborate, statewide tradition. 
</P>
<P>
The enthusiasm of the Oklahoma contestants prompted her to try this year to 
create a similar program in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"You really don't have to see performing talents. Hobbies are a God-given 
talent they can do with their hands," Ahsmuhs said. "All we ask is that they do 
something that shows their expertise." 
</P>
<P>
McGowan, a professional seamstress for more than 60 years, took the honors by 
showing off both her sunny personality and her colorful crochet projects. She 
sells her crafts but charges only what the yarn cost, "because I love to make 
people happy." 
</P>
<P>
During the group interview with judges before the pageant, McGowan was far from 
a picture of intense competition. Her salt-and-pepper hair neatly braided and a 
silk-flower corsage pinned to her favorite blue dress, she sat crocheting 
contentedly with yarn that flowed from a knitting bag she had made for the 
front of her metal walker. 
</P>
<P>
She stopped her needlework long enough to tell judges why she spends so much 
time with her crochet hooks and yarn. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't do nothing else, so it's a nice pastime," McGowan explained, laughing 
lightly. "I pray every morning for the Lord to let me do something useful, and 
people like these things, so I do this." 
</P>
<P>
During the pageant, McGowan, who is bent from arthritis, shuffled carefully to 
the microphone. She showed off the bright orange and pink blocks of an afghan 
in the making, purple and white booties and a pink butterfly refrigerator 
magnet. 
</P>
<P>
Carole Ware, activities director for the Carson Retirement Center, said it took 
some talking to get residents interested in the pageant. 
</P>
<P>
"At first they were saying, 'Beauty pageant? We're no beauties,' " Ware said. 
"We wanted to remind them they still have charm, they still have dignity. The 
things they used to do, they still can do." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, seven women agreed to participate. One become ill just before the 
pageant and had to drop out. 
</P>
<P>
The six at the pageant seemed a little perplexed by the fuss. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what I'm doing here. I don't have a talent but to laugh," 
60-year-old Dot Spindler, a retired bookkeeper, told the audience. 
</P>
<P>
The three judges -- Andrea Reeder, administrator of the Miss Torrance Pageant; 
Art Alvarado of Bay Harbor Hospital and Eric Bennett, an account executive for 
Senior World Magazine -- read recommendations from center staff members and 
chatted with contestants before making their decision. 
</P>
<P>
Ahsmuhs told them to rate contestants in the areas of hobby or talent, 
personality, contributions to their retirement center and life philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
When the time came to award the crown, there were none of the tears and squeals 
common to television beauty pageants. The winners were announced in traditional 
style -- runners-up first. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her modesty, Spindler won the second runner-up award -- a beauty 
makeover at a local salon. 
</P>
<P>
As first runner-up, Francis Lapham -- who told the audience about the porcelain 
and rag dolls she makes -- won a free dinner at Denny's in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
McGowan, the center's new queen, will enjoy a free dinner at Tony Roma in 
Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Contestants greeted the pronouncements with calm, pleased smiles but had little 
to say afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Five more preliminary pageants will be staged in the next two months at 
Huntington Retirement Center, Vermont Retirement Center, Torrance Retirement 
Center, Villa Sorrento and Pacific Inn in Torrance. The final pageant will be 
at Pacific Inn on Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
"We are starting out small, but we know this is going to catch on," Ahsmuhs 
said. "You can just see a gleam in their eye. They think, 'People are going to 
get to see and notice me because of what I've done in my life.' You can't match 
that."

CRITICAL OF FIRM WITH NO PERMIT, GADFLY HAS NO LICENSE FOR HIS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Lawndale Planning Commissioner Gary McDonald, a longtime city activist 
who last month publicly lambasted a local business for having no building 
permits, has operated his development consulting business for almost six months 
without a business license. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's license expired June 30, according to city officials, and he faces 
administrative fines and a possible misdemeanor charge. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his license, McDonald, who has announced his intention to run for 
mayor in April, said he will renew it. 
</P>
<P>
"I just forgot," he said. "I more or less put it off." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Sarann Kruse said McDonald, a longtime political opponent, should be held 
accountable for the violation. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. McDonald is the first one to criticize anyone who makes an honest 
mistake," Kruse said, but when McDonald makes a mistake, "he expects everybody 
to laugh it off because it's just Gary." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager Paula Cone said McDonald was sent a notice in May 
warning him that his license was about to elapse and another warning a month 
after it expired. 
</P>
<P>
Cone said operating a business without a license is a misdemeanor punishable by 
a fine of up to $1,000 and six months in jail. She said the city also charges 
violators 10% of the cost of the license for every month it is not renewed. 
</P>
<P>
That means the $74 license will now cost McDonald $111. 
</P>
<P>
During a City Council meeting last month, McDonald criticized the operators of 
Unified Schools of America because the automotive trade school had performed 
construction work on its Lawndale facility without obtaining building permits. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, who said he saw the construction work during a visit to the school, 
charged that it failed to meet city codes and endangered the occupants. 
</P>
<P>
"I was absolutely shocked at what I saw," he told the council. 
</P>
<P>
The school, in the 15000 block of Hawthorne Boulevard, opened its doors in 
October, defying a City Council decision to deny the school a business license. 
A week later, city officials issued two misdemeanor citations against the 
school for operating without a business license. The city has also cited the 
school for violations of the Fire and Building codes. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview this week, Councilman Larry Rudolph, a friend and political 
ally of McDonald, said many businesses in the city are operating without a 
license. "I don't think it's right to single anybody out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Rudolph added: "Gary McDonald shouldn't be treated any better or any worse" 
than any other violator. 
</P>
<P>
Cone said it is difficult to determine how many businesses in the city are 
operating without a license because many owners do not notify the city when 
they move out of town or close their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
She said the city usually fines violators but does not normally send inspectors 
to determine if a business is operating without a license. If city officials do 
learn that a business is in violation, she said, a misdemeanor citation is 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, an activist who is politically allied with the council majority, 
acknowledged that his failure to renew his business license provides fuel for 
his political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm negligent in getting a business license," he said. "But it's not that 
earth-shattering."

VOTE CLEARS WAY FOR HOUSES NEAR AIR FORCE TEST SITE; 
</P>
<P>
LANCASTER: THE CITY'S MOVE COULD ALLOW DEVELOPMENT UNDER NOISY FLIGHT PATHS. 
CRITICS SAY THAT COULD BRING TROUBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Lancaster City Council has unanimously approved proposals that may allow 
construction of 1,450 houses below flight paths of Air Force Plant 42, despite 
protests by Air Force officials and residents who call the proposals a 
blueprint for conflict. 
</P>
<P>
The housing developments still must go through several stages of planning 
review. But critics said Wednesday's vote could result in the problems that 
have plagued residential neighborhoods near airports nationwide: blight, noise, 
pollution and ongoing homeowner-airport battles. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen time and again around this country that houses and airports just 
don't mix," said Lt. Col. Mario Cafiero, commander of Plant 42, an Air Force 
manufacturing and testing site in Palmdale that shares its runways with the 
Palmdale Regional Airport. 
</P>
<P>
He warned in an interview that noise levels will increase as new military 
aircraft projects get under way and new commercial flights begin at the 
Palmdale airport next month. Cafiero estimated that there are between 200 and 
300 military flights a day out of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"In my eyes it is ludicrous to put the least compatible type of land right 
around the airfield," Cafiero said. "Why do we have to repeat those same 
mistakes?" 
</P>
<P>
But City Council members said they voted to amend the city's General Plan as 
requested by the developers of two housing developments because the proposals 
were modified to provide lower-density housing and open space in areas most 
affected by aircraft noise. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Lynn Harrison, who voted against the original proposals earlier this 
year, said she changed her vote because of the modifications. She and other 
council members criticized the Air Force for failing to complete a study that 
officials have said will provide evidence that noise has increased in recent 
years. The city is working with Air Force noise studies that are more than 10 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a potential that if the Air Force brings us new information we may 
have to amend our policies in this area," Harrison said Thursday. She said she 
would not hesitate to vote against residential construction in that case. 
</P>
<P>
Cafiero said the Air Force study should be complete in time to affect the 
outcome of that process. 
</P>
<P>
The General Plan amendments approved this week were proposed by Kaufman and 
Broad Land Co. which plans to build 1,120 houses on 400 acres, and developer 
Robert Sessler, who wants to build 330 houses on 108 acres. 
</P>
<P>
The adjacent developments would run along Avenue L between 20th Street East and 
35th Street East in Lancaster, about a mile north of Plant 42 in Palmdale. 
Flights at Plant 42 take off to the west but then turn and climb to the north 
and east over the proposed housing areas, Cafiero said. 
</P>
<P>
After the proposals were rejected in April, Kaufman and Broad proposed that 68 
acres in which noise levels exceed city-recommended standards be divided 
between parkland, commercial space and no more than one or two houses per acre. 
The rest of the area would allow up to seven houses an acre. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Kessler modified his request to designate 43 acres of low-density 
housing within the excessive noise zone. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Els Groves said the developers satisfied the council's concerns. 
"They have a right to develop their land unless there's strong evidence that 
there are going to be problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Cafiero and local residents said the modifications do not correct what they 
called the fundamental error of allowing residential development to go forward. 
Community activist Jack Wesesky said city officials are ignoring the potential 
for noise problems and the danger that a test aircraft could crash in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"They are permitting developers and speculators to do the planning for the 
city," he said. "They are totally ignoring the comfort and safety of the 
residents." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles and Burbank have had running battles for years with 
noise-protestingneighbors of LAX and Burbank Airport, bringing legal and 
political pressure to bear against the airports. In December, 1988, a state 
administrative law judge rejected an attempt by the city of Los Angeles to 
impose stricter noise controls on Burbank Airport, ruling that Los Angeles 
helped create its own jet noise problems by allowing construction of residences 
too close to the airport. The judge said the city displayed a lack of "rational 
planning and zoning."

MAN'S SURVIVORS GET $450,000 IN VERDICT OF DOCTOR NEGLIGENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys Superior Court jury Thursday awarded $450,000 to the widow and three 
sons of a man who died after a surgeon at Medical Center of North Hollywood 
allegedly failed to promptly treat a gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
The jury found Dr. Patrick A. Tripe guilty of negligence in the Dec. 18, 1983, 
death of Jesus Rocha, 42, of Sunland. Tripe was the surgeon on call at the 
hospital when Rocha died. 
</P>
<P>
Medical Center of North Hollywood two weeks ago agreed to pay $100,000 to 
Rocha's survivors in an out-of-court settlement, said Superior Court Judge 
Robert M. Letteau, in whose court the case was heard. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics rushed Rocha to the hospital after he was struck by a bullet from a 
passing car in a North Hollywood parking lot while Christmas shopping with his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
James J. Armstrong, attorney for Rocha's widow, Marta, and sons, Pierre, 
Enrique and Jesus Jr., told jurors that Tripe took 41 minutes to get to the 
hospital and then failed to order blood or make other efforts to save Rocha's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong said Rocha called for help and tried to disconnect emergency 
equipment so he could leave the hospital because he feared the quality of 
treatment he was receiving. 
</P>
<P>
Tripe was overheard by paramedics and other hospital personnel repeatedly 
asking if Rocha had insurance, Armstrong alleged. Rocha, who worked as an 
orderly at two hospitals, did have insurance, Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
Tripe's attorney, Julius Wachs, denied any negligence. He contended that Tripe 
arrived at the hospital within 25 minutes of being called but was unable to 
save Rocha because the man had already gone into cardiac and respiratory 
arrest.

INS SEPARATES 8 HUNGER STRIKERS, MOVES THEM FROM EL CENTRO LOCKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. immigration authorities, responding to a hunger strike by eight Central 
Americans jailed at the INS detention facility in El Centro, have moved the 
strikers to separate facilities in California and Arizona amid allegations that 
one of the men has been beaten and others have been verbally abused and denied 
blankets. 
</P>
<P>
The six Salvadorans and two Guatemalans are protesting INS plans to deport them 
to their native lands. All have applied for political asylum in the United 
States based on the likelihood of political persecution if returned to Central 
America, said Carmen Mejia, an El Centro paralegal who has represented several 
of the men. 
</P>
<P>
The migrants, none of whom has legal status in the United States, are citing an 
upsurge in violence in both nations to protest impending deportations. 
</P>
<P>
At least one of the strikers has claimed that he was beaten and several others 
have said that they were denied blankets as punishment last weekend, Mejia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Murillo, an INS spokesman in San Diego, denied any abuse of the men and 
said that separating them was "standard procedure" in such cases, a move 
designed to "diffuse" the possibility of problems. The blankets were not 
withheld but were only being washed for a day, Murillo said. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the carpeting was to their satisfaction," he said. "We have 
longstanding procedures that have worked before and will work again in these 
cases." 
</P>
<P>
Murillo contended that one of the men, Carlos Morales Jordan, a 32-year-old 
Guatemalan and alleged beating victim, may have feigned his purported injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Morales contends that guards beat him in a bathroom at the El Centro camp 
Monday or Tuesday, said Richard Garcia, executive director of Centro de Asuntos 
Migratorios, a Chula Vista-based legal firm that represents migrants. Morales, 
complaining of seizures, was taken Wednesday to the El Centro Regional Medical 
Center, where, according to the INS, no injuries were found. He was returned 
the same day to the El Centro detention facility, Mejia said. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department's Office of Inspector General for Investigations, a kind 
of internal affairs unit, is conducting a preliminary review of the beating 
allegations, said Ralph Paige, San Diego-based regional inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
In the past two days, four of the hunger strikers have been sent to San 
Diego-area INS lockups, two others have been sent to an INS facility in 
Florence, Ariz., and one has been sent to an INS jail in Inglewood, Calif. 
Morales, the alleged beating victim, remained in El Centro. 
</P>
<P>
The eight began their hunger strike Saturday and have refused solid food since 
then, said Mejia. They have been drinking water, she said. Several others who 
initially participated in the protest have since dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates at El Centro, which houses about 450 prisoners, more than one-quarter 
of them Central Americans, have launched hunger strikes periodically over the 
years. All of those being held there are unable to post bond as they await the 
outcome of immigration-related legal proceedings, including cases for 
deportation, asylum and other matters. Some of the hunger strikers are 
convicted felons who have already served their time in California prisons and 
were referred to the INS for deportation, according to Murillo, the INS 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of their protest is a longstanding complaint that the asylum 
process is heavily politicized and prejudiced against nationals from El 
Salvador, Guatemala and other U.S. allies. U.S. immigration officials 
vehemently deny the allegation, maintaining that the system is impartial. 
Asylum is a status that allows foreigners to remain in the United States rather 
than be exposed to persecution in their home nations, based on political 
beliefs, race, religion or other factors. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, according to INS figures, fewer than 4% of asylum applicants from El 
Salvador and Guatemala were actually granted asylum; the majority of applicants 
were ordered deported. The governments of both nations are right-wing and have 
friendly relations with the United States. By contrast, critics note that 
asylum applicants from Nicaragua and other leftist governments are more likely 
to be granted temporary residence status in the United States.

GUILD MEMBERS AUTHORIZE UNION-TRIBUNE STRIKE; TALKS LABELED HOPELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an emotional and contentious meeting Thursday night, members of the San 
Diego Newspaper Guild voted to authorize a strike against the Union-Tribune 
Publishing Co. after its leaders said that contract negotiations were hopeless 
in their bitter dispute with the newspaper company. 
</P>
<P>
George Flynn, a Guild negotiator, said 371 members voted to sanction a strike, 
while 103 opposed it. The vote authorized the union's bargaining committee to 
call a strike at 12:01 a.m. Dec. 23, if there is no progress in upcoming 
contract talks with management. A negotiating session is scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Union-Tribune Publishing Co. publishes the San Diego Union, a morning 
paper, and the San Diego Tribune, an afternoon edition. The papers' combined 
daily circulation is more than 374,000, and 411,000 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The 474 people who voted represent less than half of the union's membership. 
About 1,150 Guild members have worked without a contract since June, 1988, and 
have not had a pay increase in two years. The contract negotiations have been 
acrimonious, with the Guild singling out publisher Helen Copley for criticism, 
charging that she is determined to break the union. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the National Labor Relations Board accused the Union-Tribune of 25 
federal labor law violations. The allegations against the company are being 
heard in an administrative hearing. NLRB officials have also accused the Guild 
of unfair labor practices for filing grievances when six employees withdrew 
from the union and the company ended their dues checkoff. 
</P>
<P>
Guild members packed a meeting room at the Stardust Hotel and spilled into an 
adjoining lobby as they heard officials from their bargaining committee argue 
for strike authorization. Besides reporters, the Guild represents employees in 
the circulation and advertising departments. 
</P>
<P>
Although union leaders argued that Dec. 23 would be the best time to strike 
because the membership is well-organized now, several members expressed concern 
about their futures and wondered if a strike would be successful when there has 
been no progress at the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard anything that would guarantee us that we would win," one 
member said. "Why would a strike force management to give us a contract when 
they've consistently refused to negotiate?" 
</P>
<P>
Others wondered if the strike was being called too late to really hurt the 
company. They argued that a strike should have been called before Thanksgiving, 
when advertising revenue increases dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing we want to do is strike. . . . But we've got to let the 
publisher know that we're damn well prepared to do that," Guild President Ed 
Jahn said. 
</P>
<P>
Jahn and other Guild leaders called for a strike authorization without 
receiving assurances from other unions at the company that they would honor the 
strike. The typographical and mailers unions are also negotiating with the 
Union-Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
The typographical workers have been working without a contract since August, 
1987, and the mailers have worked without a contract since August, 1986, and 
have not received a pay raise since February, 1986. The pressmen's union 
reached agreement on a new contract last month with the Union-Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
Union-Tribune officials have prepared for a strike by having managers put out 
mock editions. Last week management promised to replace striking employees by 
advertising for replacement workers. The company reportedly began advertising 
for workers on Thursday in some East Coast papers.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW SCHOOL NAMED FOR MOFFETT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A school under construction in the unincorporated area of Lennox was named 
Moffett Elementary School this week by the Lennox Board of Education to honor 
Kenneth L. Moffett, who has been superintendent of schools in Lennox for 11 of 
the last 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally you're dead and gone" when they name a school after you, Moffett said 
Thursday. "I was embarrassed at first and then very pleased." 
</P>

The 55,000-square-foot school on Larch Avenue is expected to be completed next 
spring. It will replace Larch Elementary School, which will be demolished next 
year to make way for the Century Freeway. Construction costs, estimated at $8 
million to $10 million, will be paid by Caltrans, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The new school is being built partially underground to control temperatures and 
insulate it against noise from nearby Los Angeles International Airport. It 
will feature movable walls, an outdoor amphitheater and a rooftop parking lot.

AFTER LULL, NEW AND COLDER SANTA ANAS COMING TO TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The San Diego area will experience a brief lull in Santa Ana winds today, only 
to have a stronger, colder set of Santa Anas arrive Sunday night and Monday 
morning, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
"The Santa Anas are falling apart, becoming very, very weak, and a sea breeze 
is starting to come in, temporarily, through Saturday," forecaster Wilbur 
Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the lull in the Santa Anas, humidity will be up a little, but still 
low. As Sunday and Monday Santa Anas come, humidity will once again plunge." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Anas will be particularly chilly because of an influx of cold air 
from Canada, cold enough for the Weather Service to issue a frost advisory for 
Sunday night in the agricultural valleys. The cooling trend will last until 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures for the inland valleys will reach lows of 27 degrees and highs of 
65 to 70 degrees Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain areas will be cool this weekend, with highs hitting 52 to 57 degrees 
Friday and lows of 23 to 33 degrees all weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Desert regions can expect highs of 70 degrees Friday, falling a bit Saturday 
and Sunday, and temperatures as low as 30 degrees at night. Winds in the desert 
will reach 30 m.p.h. before the cold Santa Ana winds kick in Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Beach temperatures will reach 66 over the weekend, with inland coastal regions 
slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
High tides for the weekend will be under 7 feet, Shigehara said, but should 
cause no problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Winter is around the corner," said Shigehara. Winter officially begins at 1:22 
p.m. next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
It may, however, arrive a bit earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Monday should be a harbinger of winter, with temperatures in the mid-60s along 
the coast and upper 60s inland, and chilly winds," Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
It appears that this winter will be nothing unusual, he added, with 
temperatures and rainfall forecast to be about the same as last year.

ENLARGING THE COUNTY BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was pleased to note that The Times has taken a strong stand with regard to 
the long overdue expansion of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
A county as large and diverse as Los Angeles requires its supervisors to be 
responsive to and representative of its constituency. This is the reason I 
introduced ACA 12, which has already passed two committees and is on the 
Assembly floor. This legislation would prohibit any supervisor from 
representing more than 1 million people. 
</P>
<P>
I agree with The Times that the number of supervisorial districts must be 
expanded. The easiest way to do so would be to put this issue on the ballot 
where passage would require only a simple majority vote of the people in the 
county. For this measure to be placed on a statewide ballot, ACA 12 would have 
to pass both houses of our state Legislature by a two-thirds vote. This is very 
difficult to achieve, particularly because this legislation really only affects 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
If the choice is left to the people, I think equity and justice will be served.

ENLARGING THE COUNTY BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shout loud enough and long enough, the old axiom goes, and you can sell the 
people anything. That appears to be exactly what your editorial attempts. 
</P>
<P>
The gist of your message is that the five-member Board of Supervisors must be 
expanded to at least seven members, perhaps even nine. There was even a mention 
of the need for an elected executive. Your reasoning is that it would provide 
better representation. 
</P>
<P>
May I suggest a lesson in history and another in civics? First, the history. 
Four times schemes to expand the Board of Supervisors and/or to establish an 
elected executive have been put before the voters. The measures were defeated 
by the voters each time. 
</P>
<P>
As a footnote to the history lesson: It just might be that the voters do not 
view making government bigger as a panacea. 
</P>
<P>
And now for the civics lesson. 
</P>
<P>
If county government was the only local representation for 8-million-plus 
people, then your call for more supervisors might have merit. But there are 86 
elected city councils serving the vast majority of Los Angeles County 
residents. It is these bodies who determine local zoning laws, levels of police 
and fire protection, the amount of development, and many other vital issues 
within their boundaries -- not the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
County government is an umbrella organization responsible for such countywide 
areas as public health, mental health and welfare. There are added 
responsibilities in law enforcement, prosecution and the judiciary.

MOORPARK SETTLES SUIT OVER MOBILE-HOME LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Moorpark has agreed to amend a rent-control ordinance governing its 
only mobile-home park as part of an out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit 
challenging the law, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement also allows Villa del Arroyo Ltd., owner of the 240-unit park 
off Los Angeles Avenue, to impose a one-time rent increase this month averaging 
18% and to begin separate billing for water next year instead of including it 
in rents. Villa del Arroyo, which filed the $1-million lawsuit in February, had 
applied for the special increase independent of the issues raised in the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The one-time increase will raise rents to $330 to $375 a month, up from $279 to 
$320 a month, according to a summary of the settlement released by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to the proposed increases prompted about 200 park residents to 
attend a City Council meeting on Sept. 20. A spokeswoman for the park's 
homeowners association could not be reached for comment on the settlement 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert S. Coldren, a Santa Ana attorney representing the park's owner, said his 
client was agreeable to the settlement but not entirely satisfied. "We don't 
like government intrusion into private property rights in any form," Coldren 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Coldren said the decision to challenge the ordinance, which the city adopted 
after its incorporation in 1983, stemmed from the success of a similar case in 
Santa Barbara. In that case, he said, the owner of a mobile-home park won 
$315,000 in damages from the city of Santa Barbara after a rent-control limit 
on increases after resale was declared unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the outcome of the Santa Barbara case, Moorpark City Manager 
Steve Kueny said Moorpark's settlement could only save the city money in legal 
fees and potential damages. Under terms of the settlement, the city will pay 
only $10,000 over the next three years to help low-income tenants of the park. 
</P>
<P>
Amendments to the ordinance will allow rents to be raised each time a 
mobile-home space is sold, instead of limiting resale increases to no more than 
once a year or twice in five years. 
</P>
<P>
Another amendment will raise the cap on yearly rent increases to coincide with 
inflationary increases. If the national cost-of-living index increases by more 
than 7%, the landlord can impose a 7% increase plus two-thirds of the amount 
the index rose above 7%. The maximum increase allowed would be 14.3%. 
</P>
<P>
The changes will be adopted at the City Council's Thursday meeting, Kueny said.

ENLARGING THE COUNTY BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for pointing out in your editorial ("Why the Gang of Five Isn't 
Enough," Dec. 6) that the current redistricting options being considered by the 
Board of Supervisors do not go far enough. We agree that five people cannot 
adequately represent the 8.5 million people of Los Angeles County and that the 
board must be enlarged. 
</P>
<P>
We also believe that the current structure deprives Los Angeles County of 
effective, accountable leadership and promotes waste and inefficiency. The 
Board of Supervisors (whatever its size) should not carry all the executive and 
legislative power to run the $9-billion enterprise that is county government. 
The Constitution requires other levels of government to separate those powers 
so that the public good is protected by a series of checks and balances. A 
strong countywide elected executive officer would provide leadership and 
accountability, and an enlarged board would provide better representation and 
more thorough, public deliberation of the issues facing this, the most diverse 
and populous county. 
</P>
<P>
The League of Women Voters calls upon the Board of Supervisors to stop wasting 
tax dollars fighting the lawsuit and agree to a settlement that enlarges the 
board (nine would be better than seven). At the same time, the board should 
place on the ballot a change in the charter to establish an elected county 
executive.

ALL HUNG UP OVER AN AREA CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some people live by the book, others by the numbers. For the second category, 
the creation of a new telephone area code out of venerable old 213 seems to 
have caused some trauma. After all, many in the San Gabriel and San Fernando 
valleys felt rejected when they were kicked out of 213 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
When Pacific Bell and General Telephone announced last week that the entire Los 
Angeles County coast would be carved into a new 310 area code beginning in 
1992, the search began for social reasons or psychological consequences. What 
would it mean for Malibu and San Pedro both to be in this new sub-state? What 
was the political fallout of dividing West Hollywood between the two code 
areas? 
</P>
<P>
Patient telephone company personnel explained that the split was done purely of 
the numbers, by the numbers and for the numbers, with no discrimination 
intended. The technological explosion has outrun available digits. No one 
anticipated having to create a new area this soon, but the phenomenon of fax 
machines, paging devices and cellular telephones ate up numbers like a hungry 
Pac-Man. Pacific Bell cannot tell how many lines are devoted to fax machines, 
but there are 258,000 cellular phones now in use and paging devices have 
consumed 42 prefixes. 
</P>
<P>
If any Southlanders feel slighted by being turned out of good ol' 213, consider 
Oakland and the rest of eastern San Francisco Bay. They are being ejected from 
sophisticated 415 and given a 510 area of their own in 1991. Gertrude Stein's 
great line about Oakland will have to go. Now there is a there, there.

My family has always been proud of our Mexican and German heritages during our 
gatherings and special trips taken to the places where our family lived in 
Mexico and Germany. My father is proud of his heritage as many of us are, but 
has chosen not to wear it on his sleeve as The Times is suggesting. He hasn't 
had to. During the last two elections he has run unopposed in a district that 
happens to be largely Latino/Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
As he nears the end of his political life it would do well to look at his 
accomplishments over the last 25 years. Your paper has failed to do so over and 
over again. It is no wonder that people of high purpose, intelligence, caring 
and good strong values, like my father, do not seek public office or stay in it 
very long. Journalism such as your recent efforts breaks down the willingness 
to serve the people. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing full well what goes on in the county, and what it takes to politically 
survive there, I've seen races hard fought (Mike Antonovich) and lost (Baxter 
Ward, Yvonne Braithwaite Burke) due to the kind of representation that forces 
voters to think harder about their choices in county government. 
</P>
<P>
The people of the First District have spoken very loud over the last 18 years 
with their vote. He must be doing something right.

I appreciated the article "Lady Marine Takes Charge of Few Good Recruits" (Part

successful as men, without sacrificing their womanhood. 
</P>
<P>
However, I regret the fact that the writer put such effort into emphasizing the 
staff sergeant's gender. I think we should look at Ann Marie Wells' 
accomplishments as successes of a person, not of a female. If men and women are 
ever going to be treated as equals, we must stop concentrating on 
distinguishing between the sexes.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : COUNTYWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego County district attorney's office has decided to forward its 
investigation into Sheriff John Duffy's unreported outside income to the state 
Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Casey, a spokesman for the district attorney, said Thursday that, after 
many interviews and a review of state law, his office believes the 
investigation into Duffy's work as a private consultant should be conducted by 
the FPPC in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
In sending its case file to the state agency, Casey added, the district 
attorney has made no conclusions as to whether Duffy violated any laws by not 
disclosing the income he received as a consultant for private firms. 
</P>
<P>
"The only determination made at this point is that it's appropriate for them 
(the FPPC) to review it," he said. "We've talked to them about it, and they 
agree. Now, it's up to them to make any conclusions." 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office announced in October that it was reviewing state 
laws to see whether Duffy should have included the outside income in his annual 
Statement of Economic Interest forms. 
</P>
<P>
Although Duffy had in the past claimed he lived solely on his county salary, he 
later conceded working as a private consultant on law enforcement-related 
projects. But he has asserted that, because the work was performed for other 
government agencies, he was not required to disclose the income on his annual 
forms.

JERUSALEM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whom the gods would destroy they first tempt to resolve the Arab-Israeli 
conflict, Irving Kristol once observed. 
</P>
<P>
George Bush and James Baker should be extremely wary of the political quicksand 
into which they are attempting to lead Israelis, Egyptians and 
still-unidentified Palestinians. The probability is that Bush and Baker will 
fail in their attempt to promote an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue desired by 
neither Israelis nor Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has already strained Israeli trust and American good will. 
The White House's recent very public delay in granting a presidential 
appointment to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was an effort to pressure 
and embarrass Israel. The refusal of the United States to provide Israel clear 
and complete information about Egypt's responses to Baker's five points creates 
more mistrust. The extraordinary request by the United States that leaders of 
the Israeli opposition Labor Party be included in Israel's team preparing for 
talks in Washington was widely regarded as insulting. 
</P>
<P>
Why have Bush and Baker acted this way? Are they trying to demonstrate to a 
disbelieving Arab world that the United States is neutral between Israelis and 
the Palestinians? Do they want to intensify disagreement within Shamir's 
government in the hope that it will be replaced by a more tractable Labor 
government? Were they unable to get from Egypt a response to Baker's five 
points that would be minimally acceptable to the government of Israel? Is it 
possible that the Bush/Baker team, which is correctly sensitive to Mikhail 
Gorbachev's pride and Deng Xiao-ping's pride, does not understand that Israelis 
also are proud? 
</P>
<P>
Always poor, prospects for settlement have become even bleaker in the last 
year, complicated by the Palestine Liberation Organization's declaration of an 
independent state, by the withdrawal of King Hussein from a role in the West 
Bank, by the rise of Muslim fundamentalism and by the extension of Syria's 
power. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO declaration was intended to make an independent state the only 
alternative to Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. King Hussein's 
"divorce" from the West Bank underscored this narrowed choice by removing "the 
Jordanian option" for a Palestinian solution. But "the Jordanian option" was 
precisely the "solution" preferred by Israeli as well as West Bank moderates. 
Its removal weakened the case of Israelis ready to abandon "Judea and Samaria" 
to the right kind of neighboring power. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to present Yasser Arafat as the "moderate" solution was never very 
persuasive, either in Israel or the United States. The case for dealing with 
him declines further as his own power wanes. The spread of Muslim 
fundamentalism on the West Bank and in Gaza and the growing power of Arafat's 
principal rival, Syria's Hafez Assad, mean that Arafat is not in a position to 
guarantee peace -- even if he were inclined to do so. Events in Lebanon and 
Jordan have shown that in this area, tendencies to factionalism, extremism and 
violence are more powerful than Arafat or the Arab League. 
</P>
<P>
In Israel they're describing 1989 as the year the intifada turned on itself. 
The big development was inter-Arab violence, with the number of Palestinian 
"collaborators" hacked to death by other Palestinians variously estimated from 
118 to 160. Obviously these "collaborators" also testify to the PLO's problem 
in commanding the loyalty of all West Bankers. 
</P>
<P>
But there is an oasis of relative tranquility where Arabs and Israelis meet in 
peace if not in harmony. That is Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Life in Jerusalem is nearly normal. The intifada still calls the Arab merchants 
of East Jerusalem out on strike each day. The merchants respond. They close 
their shops at noon and do not reopen until the next morning. But the 
disruption of life is minimal. Street vendors have multiplied. Local 
inhabitants do their shopping in the morning. Schools are open. Public meetings 
are held. The streets are safer than those of most American cities. There were 
only 11 homicides in the first 11 months of this year, about half of them 
related to politics. 
</P>
<P>
The peace process that pacified Jerusalem is Mayor Teddy Kollek's endless 
effort and boundless commitment to provide basic municipal services and 
fairness to all of Jerusalem's inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
Even Kollek is concerned today about the future of this city he so passionately 
loves. Jerusalem is not mentioned in Baker's five points, he notes, but Arafat 
has said again and again that East Jerusalem must be the capital of a 
Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
It cannot be, Kollek vows. He is ready to give Arab citizens of Jerusalem their 
own schools, public services of all kinds and their own vote in municipal 
affairs. He respects their right to remain Jordanian citizens. He promises to 
accord Arabs all the rights a democracy guarantees its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
But even Teddy Kollek has his own non-negotiable demand. "We shan't give up any 
part of Jerusalem, not under any circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Most Americans are not neutral between the non-negotiable demands of Teddy 
Kollek and Yasser Arafat: The one is a paragon of democracy; the other is a man 
who opposes elections and proclaims himself "the sole representative of the 
Palestinian people." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe before Bush and Baker take on the Arab-Israeli conflict, they should 
practice on something easier, like settling the problem of Cyprus.

WHY NOT SELL AT THE LOCAL PHARMACY?; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: SINCE STRICTER LAWS AND TOUGHER ENFORCEMENT HAVE NOT CLEARED THE STREETS 
OF ADDICTS AND PUSHERS, IT'S TIME TO THINK SERIOUSLY ABOUT LEGALIZATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM M. KUNSTLER, William M. Kunstler is vice president and staff 
attorney for the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
It was only 80 years ago, when Congress passed the Harrison Act, that drugs 
became illegal in this country. During America's greatest period of greatest 
expansion, drugs were freely and legitimately obtainable. Opium balls were used 
to put crying babies to sleep; the corner pharmacy catered to any taste in what 
are now called controlled substances. The highest rate of addiction in American 
history was among Union troops during the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
Once narcotics were prohibited by a battery of increasingly stringent federal 
and state laws, the development of an enormously profitable black market in 
drugs became inevitable. The rate of addiction rose sharply, the result of both 
the forbidden-fruit effect and aggressive, highly motivated pushers. Today, by 
conservative estimates, we have at least 3 million Americans hopelessly hooked 
on heroin, cocaine, crack or hallucinogenics. Roughly 23 million Americans use 
some of these substances each month. 
</P>
<P>
Drug-related crime is steadily increasing, including roughly 750 murders a year 
over turf disputes. Our courts stagger under the weight of 824,000 annual drug 
arrests, and our prisons are glutted with convicted offenders. 
</P>
<P>
No current -- or past -- local or national policy has been able to stem this 
horrendous tide. From Nancy Reagan's cruelly foolish slogan, "Just say no to 
drugs," to the pyramiding of criminal sanctions, including even the death 
penalty, nothing has proved to be even slightly effective in either curbing 
addiction or preventing importation and sale. 
</P>
<P>
In early 1988, Kurt Schmoke, a former federal prosecutor and the newly elected 
mayor of Baltimore, addressing a meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, 
startled his audience by recommending that there be "a national debate about 
decriminalizing drugs." Recently, former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, 
now teaching economics at Stanford University, suggested that "we should at 
least be willing to debate (these) issues." And this week, Robert W. Sweet, a 
federal judge in Manhattan and former assistant U.S. attorney, refocused 
attention on the issue when he called for the legalization of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, a New York state senator, Joseph L. Galiber, introduced a 
drug-decriminalization bill loosely modeled after laws in effect in Great 
Britain for almost half a century. While it has no chance of passage, given the 
public's current overwhelming antipathy to legalization, it deserves serious 
attention and consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Under its provisions, a five-member Controlled Substance Authority would be 
created, with power to license physicians and pharmacists who met stringent 
qualification to sell drugs legally to persons older than 21. No licenses would 
be issued to applicants whose offices or places of business were within 200 
feet of schools or houses of worship. 
</P>
<P>
In introducing his bill, Galiber argued that "by decriminalizing the sale, 
possession and use of controlled substances, we won't end the demand (for 
drugs), but we can take the huge profits out and remove the heinous criminal 
elements. Then we can attempt serious efforts in combating drugs through 
education and treatment." 
</P>
<P>
It is obviously impossible to predict whether the proponents of legalization 
are on the right track. But since criminalization has not worked, no matter how 
rigorous or harsh its enforcement, is it not time to accept the suggestion of 
Shultz and Sweet, among others, and initiate a national debate on the issue? Or 
shall we continue to treat drugs as a problem for the criminal-justice system 
rather than as a health question, with all the attendant misery, cost and 
futility, without even exploring what well might be a workable alternative? It 
simply makes no sense to keep knocking on a door that thus far has led to 
nowhere when there may be others that open onto more productive avenues.

INVESTMENT IN RIK SMITS IS PAYING DIVIDENDS FOR PACERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Steve Stipanovich was injured a year ago, the Indiana Pacers had to get 
production from 7-foot-4 Rik Smits faster than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Under normal circumstances, Smits, a 23-year-old native of the Netherlands, 
would have been given more time to mature. 
</P>
<P>
Smits' education is one reason the Pacers won only five of their first 28 games 
last season. With Stipanovich's career over, Smits is a bigger reason the 
Pacers are 13-5 and lead the NBA's Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
Smits scored 13 of his 30 points in a 25-9 first quarter of a 102-78 victory 
over the New Jersey Nets in East Rutherford, N.J., Thursday night. He finished 
with 15 rebounds and was 10 for 10 from the free-throw line to pace the Pacers, 
who were 21 for 21. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers made Smits, who played at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., the 
No. 2 pick in the 1988 draft. 
</P>
<P>
"Rik is developing into one of the best centers in the league," teammate Reggie 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 104, Houston 100 -- Willie Anderson scored seven of his 19 points 
in an 11-2 Spurs' spurt in the closing minutes at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the Spurs a 13-6 record and a tie with Utah for first place in 
the Midwest Division. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 105, Charlotte 101 -- Mark Alarie sank an 18-footer with 15 seconds 
left to break a 101-101 tie, and the Hornets lost their ninth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Armon Gilliam, obtained in a trade with Phoenix Kurt Rambis, played 18 minutes 
in his Hornet debut and had nine points. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 124, Orlando 113 -- Michael Jordan scored 26 of his 38 points in the 
first half at Chicago as the Bulls cruised to victory. DAN HAFNER

UBRIACO RAPS LEMIEUX, COFFEY; PENGUINS, NORTH STARS TIE, 4-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gene Ubriaco, recently fired as coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins, put much of 
the blame for the team's problems on stars Mario Lemieux and Paul Coffey. 
</P>
<P>
"They deserted me the last two weeks," Ubriaco told the Associated Press 
Thursday in Pittsburgh. "I made the mistake of treating them like men. It was 
almost impossible to coach Lemieux. It was like trying to teach a shark table 
manners." 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux, who said he might answer Ubriaco's charges later, and the Penguins are 
doing better under interim Coach Craig Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
They blew a 4-1 lead and had to settle for a 4-4 tie Thursday night with the 
Minnesota North Stars at Bloomington, Minn., but are 3-1-1 since Ubriaco was 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Larry Murphy went around the Penguin defense and beat Tom Barrasso 
with 7:47 left in regulation to climax the North Stars' rally. 
</P>
<P>
The tie ended Minnesota's seven-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux had an assist and has at least one point in 20 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 3, Philadelphia 2 -- It was not a good night for the Flyers. After 
learning that goaltender Ron Hextall's latest injury would keep him out at 
least six more weeks, they lost for the first time in four games at 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Mike Tomlak broke a tie with a power play goal at 12:04 of the last 
period to give the Whalers their first victory at Philadelphia in more than 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Hextall, one of the best goalies in the NHL, has played only two games this 
season. He reinjured a groin Wednesday night in a rehabilitation game at New 
Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 8, Quebec 2 -- The Nordiques were overwhelmed by the Flames at Calgary 
and learned that goaltender Greg Millen, obtained in a trade with St. Louis, 
refused to report. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec (6-23-4) has given up 21 goals in the last three games. DAN HAFNER

WHEN THEY'RE TELLING US THE STORY, WHY CAN'T THEY TELL US THE SCORE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the approach of the holiday playoff season, here are two requests of the 
football announcers who will be assigned to the games: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Please give us the score once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Please recapitulate the scoring occasionally. If you remember what happened 
an hour ago, tell us about it some time, very briefly. 
</P>
<P>
This is hardly new advice. Announcers have been hearing it since the invention 
of radio. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that anyone can be an announcer. In a perfect world that 
couldn't happen. Ideally, no one would be allowed in the booth unless he 
listened to several hours of Vin Scully tapes and taken a written examination 
proving that he understands why Scully does it right. 
</P>
<P>
Are the networks to blame? Columnist Art Buchwald thinks not. 
</P>
<P>
Holding the announcers at fault, Buchwald says: "Before announcing a game, all 
sportscasters take a blood oath not to reveal the score because it will take 
away the suspense from the fans who have tuned in late." 
</P>
<P>
This is particularly annoying in a broadcast using three announcers, one of 
whom ought to be held responsible for reiterating the score, and also the 
scoring, regularly. 
</P>
<P>
But recaps can be easily managed in one-announcer telecasts, too, as Scully has 
shown. 
</P>
<P>
If it's 24-7 in the third quarter, something must have happened in the first 
half, when we were on the phone or the freeway, or both, and missed it. 
</P>
<P>
Probably the strangest thing about football announcers, as a group, is that 
although they were hired not to predict but to describe, most would rather 
guess at the next play than set the stage by explaining, briefly, what's 
happened so far. 
</P>
<P>
Screened graphics are helpful but incomplete. It isn't enough to know that 
Smith scored on a one-yard run or that Jones kicked a 20-yard field goal. How 
did they get the ball down there? 
</P>
<P>
What's the score? 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas City Chiefs are playing the best football in the American Conference 
right now, and although they are a longshot to make the playoffs, they are 
probably going to get there in a season of ups and downs for most clubs. 
</P>
<P>
With two weeks left, the Chiefs' edge, mathematically, is that they held the 
Cleveland Browns to a tie last month, starting the Browns' slide to 7-6-1. 
</P>
<P>
In the AFC wild-card race, the Chiefs, also 7-6-1, are still half a game behind 
Miami, Buffalo and the Raiders, all 8-6 -- but they are half a game ahead of 
Indianapolis, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh, all 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs' edge in personnel terms is their defensive efficiency and their 
ground power with 260-pound fullback Christian Okoye. 
</P>
<P>
On the off tracks of December, Kansas City appears to be better positioned to 
run the ball and defend against the run and pass than any other NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps only Minnesota and Houston can match Kansas City's all-around defensive 
strength. Up front, the Chiefs have a rookie-of-the-year linebacker, Derrick 
Thomas. In back they have the NFL's finest secondary with Deron Cherry and the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
Since opening day, Kansas City has shown everything it needed to make the Super 
Bowl except a quarterback. And lately, Steve DeBerg has seemed, for the first 
time in 13 years, to be a champion at that position. 
</P>
<P>
While the Chiefs were winning their third in a row last Sunday, defeating Green 
Bay, 21-3, after surprisingly routing Houston, 34-0, DeBerg was accosted by 
Kansas City Coach Marty Schottenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
"Why have you suddenly improved so much?" Schottenheimer asked. 
</P>
<P>
Said DeBerg: "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
The AFC's key playoff-deciding games of 1989: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kansas City: San Diego Sunday; at Miami Dec. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Raiders: At Seattle Sunday and at the New York Giants Dec. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buffalo: At San Francisco Sunday and at the New York Jets Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Miami: At Indianapolis Sunday; Kansas City Dec. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Purnell, who coaches Seattle's tight ends, noted the other day that more 
pass receivers than ever have been wearing gloves this year -- even on warm 
days. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt if they catch the ball any better in gloves," Purnell said. "But they 
think they do, and I'm sure they think they look good in gloves. And for most 
of them, of course, those are the two things that matter." 
</P>
<P>
A former aide to John Robinson at USC, Purnell said he has seen receivers in 
two types of gloves this season, a skin diver's and a baseball batter's. 
</P>
<P>
"Some might slip on a little stickum," he said, identifying a banned substance. 
"But probably not many. 
</P>
<P>
"When (Seattle) receivers wear gloves, we only insist on one thing. They've got 
to wear them all week in practice." 
</P>
<P>
The Ram-49er series this season, as Ram Coach John Robinson said at Anaheim 
this week, will probably come down to the NFC title game, which, if they're 
both in it, will be played at Candlestick Park Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
If so, it should be remembered that turnovers were decisive the first two 
times: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In San Francisco Oct. 1, the 49ers were going in for the put-away touchdown 
in the final minutes when fullback Tom Rathman fumbled, setting up the drive 
that gave the Rams a 13-12 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At Anaheim Monday night, the Rams were comfortably ahead in the fourth 
quarter before they fumbled twice and lost, 30-27. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana should have won the first game and Jim Everett the second, leaving 
the rubber game in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Is Montana the best of all time? You can't really compare him with Hall of 
Famers Joe Namath and John Unitas, or any other old-timer, because Montana 
doesn't call his own plays. But Montana is the best recently. 
</P>
<P>
He also has one continuing advantage over most quarterbacks -- the opportunity 
to throw the ball to perhaps the most gifted broken-field runner who ever 
played wide receiver, John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
The memory that will linger longest from Monday night is Taylor taking short 
passes for long touchdowns on plays that measured 92 and 95 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Considering their significance in a game that the Rams led at different times 
by 17 points, those were the NFL's two plays of the year.

IT'S ALREADY BEEN SEASON OF BUMPS, LUMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BOB LOCHNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has been barely three weeks since the international racing season started, 
and already a high percentage of the world's top skiers have gone flying off 
bumps, crashing into fences and otherwise knocking themselves off the slopes 
for days, weeks or months. 
</P>
<P>
The latest string of accidents occurred during World Cup downhill training at 
Val Gardena, Italy, where in the last two days: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Peter Mueller of Switzerland, downhill silver medalist in both the 1988 
Winter Olympics and the 1989 World Championships, fell in a bumpy stretch of 
the course, tore ligaments in his left knee and is expected to be lost for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mueller's teammate, Philip Schuler, and Austria's Gerhard Pfaffenbichler 
and Peter Wirnsberger II suffered knee injuries on those same "camel's bumps" 
and will be sidelined indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Although questions have been raised about the safety precautions being taken by 
organizers of this and other World Cup events, one racer, Norwegian Attle 
Skaardahl, told the Associated Press that the Val Gardena course was safe, 
adding: "You can face risks only if you are not fast enough at the bumps or 
undecided about the line to follow." 
</P>
<P>
Swiss star Pirmin Zurbriggen said Mueller crashed "because he was clearly 
uncertain about whether to jump or go around the bumps." 
</P>
<P>
These accidents happened less than a week after mishaps that felled: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alberto Tomba of Italy, a double Olympic gold medalist in 1988, who broke 
his collarbone in a super-giant slalom at Val d'Isere, France, last Sunday and 
will be out until the middle of January. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg, a three-time World Cup overall champion, who 
suffered a severe kidney bruise when he smashed through a plastic fence during 
another super-G race at Sestriere, Italy, on Tuesday and will be unable to ski 
again until after the holiday break, Jan. 6-7 at Kranjska Gora, Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Of the course at Sestriere, Zurbriggen said: "Safety along the track was not 
good enough," and added that it was as fast and technically demanding as a 
downhill. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the following were victims: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tamara McKinney of the United States, a former World Cup champion and 
women's combined gold medalist in last February's World Championships, who 
injured her left knee during training on a Swiss glacier in mid-October and may 
never race again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vreni Schneider of Switzerland, the defending World Cup women's champion 
and a double Olympic gold medalist in 1988, who underwent arthroscopic surgery 
this week after jamming her left knee during a practice downhill run Dec. 6 at 
Steamboat Springs, Colo., and will not return until competition resumes in 
Europe Jan. 6-7 at Piancavallo, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael Mair of Italy, Martin Hangl of Switzerland and Helmut Mayer of 
Austria, each of whom have missed races with one injury or another. 
</P>
<P>
Skiing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The women on the Alpine World Cup circuit will ski in a pair of downhills 
Saturday and Sunday at Panorama, Canada. The resort is 11 miles west of 
Invermere, B.C. . . . Austria's Anita Wachter remains atop the overall 
standings with 103 points, followed by two West Germans, Michaela Gerg with 98 
and Regina Mosenlechner with 62. 
</P>
<P>
The men will compete in four races over seven days -- downhills today and 
Saturday at Val Gardena; a slalom Sunday at Madonna di Campiglio, Italy, and 
another downhill next Thursday at Saalbach-Hinterglemm, Austria, site of the 
next World Championships, Jan. 21-Feb. 3, 1991. . . . Ole Christian Furuseth of 
Norway is still the overall leader with 118 points, but three-time champion 
Pirmin Zurbriggen is only 17 behind after winning the super-G last Tuesday at 
Sestriere. Armin Bittner of West Germany is third with 79. 
</P>
<P>
Cross-country skiers will continue their North American tour this weekend in 
Canada with Nordic World Cup races for the men at Thunder Bay, Ontario, and for 
the women at Calgary. . . . Last weekend's season-opening winners at Mountain 
Dell, east of Salt Lake City, were Sweden's 40K relay team, anchored by Gunde 
Svan; Italy's Stefania Belmondo in the women's 15K freestyle; Norway's Bjorn 
Daehlie in the men's 15K classical, and Finland's Janna Savolainen in the 
women's 5K classical. . . . Leslie Thompson of Park City, Utah, finished 19th 
behindBelmondo. 
</P>
<P>
World Cup jumpers will hop over to Sapporo, Japan, this weekend for the third 
stop on their around-the-world odyssey. Ari-Pekka Nikkola of Finland leads the 
standings with 57 points after winning the 70-meter competition at Lake Placid, 
N.Y., last weekend. He is six ahead of Ernst Vettori of Austria, who took the 
90-meter event. Jan Bokloew of Sweden and Heinz Kuttin of Austria are tied for 
third with 48. Mike Holland of Norwich, Vt., was the highest-placed American, 
finishing 36th in the 90-meter and 48th in the 70-meter. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Mahre's victory over his twin brother, Steve, in the final of the U.S. Pro 
Tour's slalom last Sunday at Waterville Valley, N.H., moved him into second 
place in the standings with 75 points, 13 behind defending champion Jorgen 
Sundqvist of Sweden, who is also the top money-winner with $8,950. Sundqvist 
defeated Austria's Guido Hinterseer in the giant slalom final. . . . Niklas 
Lindqvist of Sweden is tied for third with Joerg Seiler of Switzerland, each 
with 70 points. The pros stop at Nashoba Valley, Mass., near Boston this 
weekend. Locally, the California Handicap Ski School will be dedicated Sunday 
at Bear Mountain, near Big Bear Lake. The school was made possible through 
contributions by the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles and other 
individuals and organizations.

CSUN SLIPS PAST CAL STATE HAYWARD; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: DERRICK GATHERS SCORES 25 POINTS AND GRABS 11 REBOUNDS TO 
LEAD THE MATADORS TO A 66-56 NONCONFERENCE WIN.

It will never go down in the Cal State Northridge highlight films, yet Thursday 
night's 66-56 victory over Cal State Hayward in a nonconference men's 
basketball game was crucial for the Matadors as they won a tight game after 
dropping two similar contests earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (3-4) shot only 36.2% (25 of 69) from the field and turned the ball 
over 18 times, but for the first time this season, the Matadors made the key 
plays down the stretch to win a close game. 
</P>
<P>
"That was not a very good basketball game," Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said. 
"But (Jemarl) Baker and (Derrick) Gathers hit a couple of critical three-point 
baskets down the stretch. We executed well, but we didn't finish off our 
plays." 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 51-50, with four minutes, 33 seconds to play, Northridge struck for 
six points in the next 1:12 to take a seven-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Brodowski made one of two free throws to start the run, and Gathers 
followed with a rebound basket and a three-point basket. 
</P>
<P>
Hayward (6-2) narrowed the deficit to 57-54 on an Alvin Gordon basket and two 
David Parker free throws, but Bakers' three-point shot gave Northridge a 60-54 
advantage with 2:17 left. Sam Moses' jump shot cut the lead to four, but the 
Pioneers didn't score again as Northridge got a rebound basket from Kendell 
McDaniels and a pair of free throws each from Eugene Humphrey and Gathers. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers had game-high totals of 25 points and 11 rebounds for the Matadors as 
he scored 21 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
After shooting two of nine from the field in the first half, Gathers hit eight 
of 15 after intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Hayward's Demetrius Mitchell was the most spectacular player on the court, 
however. He threw down two monster dunks and almost single-handedly kept the 
Pioneers in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell (19 points) only scored two points in the first half after committing 
his third foul less than 10 minutes into the game, but he was nearly 
unstoppable in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-11, 198-pound junior from McClymonds High, a legend on the 
playgrounds of Oakland, gave Hayward a 44-42 lead on a three-point shot with 
8:43 left. 
</P>
<P>
And shortly thereafter, he tied the score twice with spectacular breakaway 
jams. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just a great, great athlete," Cassidy said of Mitchell. "He's famous up 
there on the playground and you saw why." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell scored Hayward's first five points of the second half and 17 of the 
first 26 before Northridge shut him down. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who made seven of 12 shots, scored 15 points for Northridge; McDaniels 
(nine rebounds) and Humphrey each added eight. Parker had nine points for 
Hayward and Moses added eight. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge led, 28-23, at halftime. Both teams shot poorly after hitting their 
first two shots.

SOUTHERN SECTION BACKS RULING ON 'FIFTH DOWN' 
</P>

Game officials acted correctly when they allowed Santa Barbara High a so-called 
fifth down against Canyon in a Division II semifinal football game Dec. 2, 
according to a Southern Section administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Clark said Thursday that a review of videotape of the game's final 10 
seconds indicated that game officials had acted "within the parameters of the 
rules" and that the case is closed. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon officials claim that their team was wronged in the controversial 28-27 
overtime loss to Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
With Canyon leading, 21-14, with 10 seconds left, Santa Barbara quarterback 
Poncho Renteria fumbled the snap at the Canyon one-yard line on fourth down, 
but the Cowboys were penalized for swatting the snap. After officials walked 
off the penalty, the clock was started with four seconds left and Canyon 
stopped Santa Barbara for a two-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
However, the officials realized that they had erred, according to Clark, and 
stopped that play before it was over. The clock was stopped and on the ensuing 
play, the "fifth down," Santa Barbara scored a touchdown to force overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said that Santa Barbara was entitled to a final play because the 
officials ruled that when the Cowboys swatted the snap they attempted to 
consume time illegally, a violation of the National Federation of State High 
School Assn. rules.

AGAIN FLYING AT ALTITUDE; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: SKY-WALKING SHELTON BOYKIN WAS GROUNDED IN THE BIG-TIME 
PROGRAM OF TEXAS EL PASO, BUT, TWO TROUBLED YEARS LATER, HE IS AIRBORNE AT 
VALLEY. 
</P>

<P>
The Brigham Young basketball coaches were on the phone wanting to know the 
whereabouts of their recruit. They had sent a car to pick him up at the Salt 
Lake City but had come up empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
His high school coach started looking for him and found him in class, still 
wearing a suit and carrying his suitcase. Sky-walking Shelton Boykin, a great 
dunker and a champion hurdler at San Fernando High, was afraid to fly. 
</P>
<P>
Boykin eventually quelled his fear of flying enough to venture off to Texas El 
Paso on a basketball scholarship, but, once there, he again was grounded. He 
played only 25 minutes as a freshman and did not rejoin the team for his 
sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
More than two troubled years after leaving San Fernando, he is finding the 
skies a little friendlier at Valley College. A 6-foot-4 1/2 swingman, he is 
frequently flying for points and adding his hyperkinetic athleticism to the 6-4 
Monarchs' mix of transfers, redshirts and recruits. 
</P>
<P>
"I think going to UTEP was the biggest mistake I ever made in my life," said 
Boykin, who felt very small playing big-time basketball for one of the sport's 
most accomplished coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Don (The Bear) Haskins coached UTEP -- then Texas Western -- to an NCAA 
championship in 1966, and UTEP has the seventh-highest winning percentage in 
the 1980s among Division I teams. Perhaps the highest-profile coach in the 
Southwest, Haskins was nonetheless such a distant figure for Boykin that seeing 
him in a passing car was a memorable occasion. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him once. I was like, 'Damn, saw coach,' " Boykin said. "Coach Haskins, 
we didn't talk too much. It was like 'Hi' and 'Bye'. . . . No player had a good 
relationship with him. You saw him at practice, on the way to a game. He was 
like a bear -- hibernating." 
</P>
<P>
Haskins called Boykin "a heck of a nice guy" but admitted that he didn't 
remember him very well. 
</P>
<P>
Boykin said that his relationship with assistant coach Norm Ellenberger was 
even worse. 
</P>
<P>
"To us, he was a coach like a butcher, like, 'I can use this piece of meat, but 
I can't use this,' " Boykin said. 
</P>
<P>
UTEP assistant Nate Archibald, a former pro star, was Boykin's link to the 
coaching staff. Archibald was a mentor for Boykin and several other players but 
left early in the 1987-88 season after his troubles with the Internal Revenue 
Service and other personal problems became public. 
</P>
<P>
"After he quit, things went downhill real bad," Boykin said. "When Nate quit, 
we (the freshmen) just turned into practice players." 
</P>
<P>
Observers in El Paso say that many of Archibald's recruits, including Boykin, 
were not talented enough for a Top-20 program like UTEP's; Boykin claims that 
he and the other young players had no one to stand up for them after 
Archibald's departure. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987-88 UTEP (23-10) team was known for its personality clashes. 
</P>
<P>
"We were bitter enemies," Boykin said. "First it was a problem because 
everybody was trying to take each other's girlfriends. Then it was who got 
better pub. Then it was who could dance better. It was stupid things." 
</P>
<P>
Separated from his family and missing Los Angeles, Boykin was overwhelmed by 
the ennui of the boundless Texas mesas. 
</P>
<P>
"There I could sit in study hall and stare at the books for two hours and not 
get nothing done," Boykin said. "If you've ever been there for a month, there's 
nothing to do. It's a place to go for three or four days. That's it. 
</P>
<P>
"I had everything I needed materially, but spiritually, I wasn't happy." 
</P>
<P>
According to Boykin, players had access to boosters' cars and received other 
perks. A 1989 Newsday newspaper article included similar allegations from 
Boykin's former teammate, Sean Harris. There was talk of an investigation, but 
NCAA investigators reportedly never went to El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
"When we wanted to go out, we'd get a car," Boykin said. "They were nice cars, 
Cadillacs, Mercedes, Jaguars. . . . The coaches didn't loan the cars, but 
people around the area did. The coaches went by the books, but the people, 
that's a different story. 
</P>
<P>
"They took care of us; they had some nice supporters. They're good people, but 
after the season everything slowed down." 
</P>
<P>
Boykin went to UTEP primarily for the opportunity to participate in the NCAA 
Tournament. However, the deer and the antelope were playing more than Boykin, 
who was stuck at the end of the UTEP bench and played only three minutes in a 
first-round NCAA blowout loss to Seton Hall at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Haskins said that it would take time to convert Boykin, a high school center, 
into a Division I player. 
</P>
<P>
"First off, we were pretty good," Haskins said. "Shelton didn't get to play 
much, but I think he would have. At that time he was kind of between a guard 
and a forward, kind of a wrong size. If he would polish up his skills, he could 
be a darn good player." 
</P>
<P>
Haskins played Boykin in only 10 of 33 games. Boykin shot once during his 
entire freshman season, and he had more turnovers (two) than points (none). 
</P>
<P>
Those familiar with the UTEP program say that, as a basketball player, Boykin 
was a great hurdler. One El Paso reporter called him "one of the worst players 
to ever play here," and to some extent Boykin's conflicts might have been the 
product of spending more hours on the bench than Judge Wapner. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't alone in his disenchantment, though. None of the four scholarship 
recruits in Boykin's class still play for UTEP. 
</P>
<P>
Boykin planned to transfer to College of the Sequoias for the 1988-89 season, 
but UTEP refused to release his transcript because of an overdue library book. 
He returned to UTEP for the 1989 spring semester and rejoined the track team. 
He finished third in the 110-meter high hurdles in the Western Athletic 
Conference meet then headed home to Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
After one day at College of the Canyons, he switched to Valley. He missed the 
first two games this season, both Valley losses, while taking care of academic 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
Valley has lost only once when Boykin plays. 
</P>
<P>
"He adds some leadership," Valley Coach Jim Stephens said. "He's been around 
awhile. . . . A lot of kids are out of high school and don't know what it is to 
play at the college level." 
</P>
<P>
Boykin says that he feels comfortable playing for Valley, and, surprisingly for 
someone who dislikes Texas as much as he does, his best friend on the team is a 
guy named Cliff Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
"Us right here, we are real close," Boykin said. "I started hanging out with 
Cliff and (teammate) Steve Ward, and they were cool fellas." 
</P>
<P>
Barnes, a transfer from Cal State Northridge who starts at center, and Boykin 
spend hours together playing video games. Boykin says that he might go to the 
same college Barnes chooses. Recently, when Boykin was hospitalized because of 
an ear infection, Barnes stayed the entire night with him in a bedside vigil. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach says I'm the key to the season," Boykin said. "I think it's Cliff. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I was going to play here because I forgot how good I was. I 
forgot how fast I was, how strong I was." 
</P>
<P>
Boykin tempers his braggadoccio with a Magic Johnson-wattage smile and 
easygoing nature. He also backs some of it up. 
</P>
<P>
He is averaging more than 12 points and eight rebounds a game, and those 
numbers would be higher had he not been held to two points against Mt. SAC 
while he was still suffering from the ear infection. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens calls him the best athlete on the Valley team. 
</P>
<P>
"I know one thing, nobody can get up and down the floor with him and jump with 
him," said San Fernando Coach Dick Crowell, who still marvels at a certain 
one-handed, alley-oop dunk that Boykin threw down against Eagle Rock. 
</P>
<P>
Boykin moved into the San Fernando starting lineup during his sophomore season 
and averaged 16.3 points and 9.8 rebounds as a senior. He was an All-Valley 
selection as a senior but spent his high school career playing out of position 
at center. 
</P>
<P>
"He never really developed the tools he needed for off-guard in Division I," 
Crowell said. "I think he would have been better off staying on the (West) 
Coast." 
</P>
<P>
UTEP was the strongest program to originally recruit Boykin. Santa Clara and 
St. Mary's of the West Coast Conference were others that expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
After this season, Boykin, an administrative justice major, will again go 
through the recruiting process. He says that he will only run track if the 
school has a good program and if he's "bored." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to put that on the back burner and live off the rep," said Boykin, 
who won City Section titles in the high and intermediate hurdles in 1987. "I 
don't know whether to go out riding high." 
</P>
<P>
This formerly frantic flier's basketball career is taking off again too, now 
that he realizes that playing time is more important than prime time.

MARCACHINI SCORES 31 IN NOTRE DAME WIN

G. C. Marcachini scored 31 points, including two of Notre Dame High's three 
fourth-quarter field goals, as the Knights defeated Westlake, 56-51, Thursday 
night in the championship bracket of the Beverly Hills tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame will play Royal, a 69-62 winner over Culver City, Saturday for fifth 
place in the 16-team tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Knights advanced despite nearly blowing an eight-point lead heading into 
the fourth quarter. Employing frenzied full-court pressure, Westlake forced 
Notre Dame into 14 second-half turnovers, most during the initial moments of 
the fourth quarter when Westlake outscored the Knights, 7-0, to draw within 
42-41. 
</P>
<P>
However, Paul Hewitt and Marcachini combined for 11 points over the final four 
minutes to rescue the Knights (4-4). Marcachini also grabbed a game-high 12 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
John Van Spyk paced Westlake (4-4) with 12 points. The Warriors, who had 66 
turnovers in two games last week, were plagued again -- they had 21 miscues. 
</P>
<P>
In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Royal 69, Culver City 62 -- Four Highlanders scored in double figures and Royal 
outscored the Centaurs, 12-5, over the last two minutes in a 
championship-bracket game. 
</P>
<P>
Jared Byrne scored a team-high 12 points, Greg Laranjo and Chad Smith each 
scored 11 and Chris Moriarty added 10 as Royal improved to 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa 65, St. Bernard 54 -- Eric Thomas scored 19 points and Eric Dyer added 
12 in the consolation quarterfinals as the Spartans (1-2) won for the first 
time in three games. 
</P>
<P>
Palisades 65, Crespi 59 -- Crespi fought back from a 41-27 halftime deficit in 
a consolation quarterfinal game but fell short. 
</P>
<P>
Crespi center Christian Fauria scored 15 of his 19 points in the second half to 
lead the surge. Rasaan Hall led the Celts with 23 points. TIM BROWN

MASTER'S LOSES BUT HELP SITS CLOSE AT HAND

The Master's had a lot of talent sitting on the bench Thursday night. 
Unfortunately, the Mustangs weren't able to use it. 
</P>
<P>
Master's suffered a 75-51 nonconference loss to visiting Cal State Bakersfield 
as freshmen Melvin Adams and David Humphreys and sophomore Damon Greer could 
only provide vocal support. The trio -- all guards -- won't be eligible until 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We really missed them out there tonight," said Master's Coach Mel Hankinson, 
whose team was playing its fourth game in seven days -- two of which they have 
won. 
</P>
<P>
"We were tired and exhausted. We needed them to give us a shot in the arm." 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe a shot at the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 58-48, with 5:30 remaining, Master's (7-5) went scoreless for the 
next four and a half minutes. In the same time span, Bakersfield (5-1) scored 
12 points before Jeff Newton hit a three-point basket with a minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Master's trailed, 33-23, at the half, but the Roadrunners quickly built a 
14-point lead as 6-foot-4 center Marvin Redeemer scored Bakersfield's first 11 
points. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs got within eight points twice but could get no closer. 
</P>
<P>
Redeemer finished with a game-high 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Lopez and Newton finished with 11 and 10 points for The Master's.

FISHING NOTES;

<P>
WARM WATER LURES FISH FROM KING HARBOR TO ROCKY POINT 
</P>

<P>
There may be a chill in the air but the ocean is warming up. 
</P>
<P>
A massive area of warm water has surfaced from King Harbor south to Rocky 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
At Redondo Sportfishing Pier there has been a wide-open bonito bite since last 
weekend for pier anglers and those fishing the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Warm water flowing from the Edison Plant heated the ocean's temperature in the 
harbor, which was already warmer than normal for this time of year. This 
unquestionably attracted the bonito. 
</P>
<P>
The pier's fishing space was tight as anglers hooked fish on nearly every cast. 
</P>
<P>
Two pier regulars, Ken Schultz and Barney Cohen of Redondo Beach said it's is 
just like the good old days when they had wide-open fishing for all species of 
surface fish. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said: "When we caught the five-fish limit, instead of hooking more just 
to release them for sport we put the rod up and gave the space to two 
youngsters." 
</P>
<P>
Mona Green of San Pedro was at the pier Monday and caught her five-fish limit 
of bonito in 10 minutes. Green changed her fishing gear to a halibut rig, 
inserted a squid on her hook and brought up a halibut that weighed six pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Five South Bay anglers who returned from Mexico after fishing aboard the 
private yacht Instinct reported outstanding success using kelp patties to lure 
yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Lyman and Pete Hoffman of Manhattan Beach caught easy limits. Phil 
Friedman, Bob Alvarez and Leon Campazzie of Torrance also bagged limits. 
</P>
<P>
Skipper Mitch Fowikes said this was the best trip of the fall. All fish weighed 
15 pounds or more. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: 
</P>
<P>
Joe Lepe of West Los Angeles, fishing in Santa Monica Bay on the Spitfire, 
caught the whopper of the week, a 36 1/4-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Hopkins of Mar Vista, aboard the Betty O at the Rockpile, won the jackpot 
with a 22-pound lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Kernes of Long Beach, using cut squid at Rocky Point aboard the Victory, 
won the jackpot with a 20-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Garth Mildner of Long Beach, fishing at Rocky Point on the Matt Walsh, caught a 
18-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Drimer of Lomita, aboard the First String at Rocky Point, brought a 
13-pound white sea bass out of the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Shoales of San Pedro, fishing aboard the Top Gun, caught a 12 1/2-pound 
white sea bass at Rocky Point. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Fugimoto of San Pedro, on the Diawa at the oil rigs, caught a 12-pound 
white sea bass.

Jim Vatcher, the leading hitter on the Cal State Northridge baseball team in 
1987, has been promoted to the Philadelphia Phillies' major league roster. 
</P>
<P>
Vatcher was named the Phillies' top minor-league prospect in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Last season he batted .301 with 30 doubles and 46 runs batted in at Class-A 
Clearwater of the Florida State League before moving on to double-A Reading 
(Pa.) in the Eastern League, where he batted .327 with 32 RBIs in 48 games.

San Diego State has resolved a scheduling conflict with the Padres at San Diego 
Jack Murphy Stadium by moving its home football game with Texas El Paso next 
season to Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
The game had been scheduled to be played Sept. 22, but the Padres took that 
Saturday night date for the second of a three-game series with the Cincinnati 
Reds. 
</P>
<P>
The switch of the UTEP game to what had been an open date for SDSU was made 
this week during the Western Athletic Conference winter meetings in Denver, 
Jeff Hurd, the WAC's associate commissioner, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd also said that conference athletic directors voted unanimously to return 
to round-robin scheduling in football beginning with the 1991 season. This will 
end a scheduling format adopted in 1986, and instituted this past season, that 
allowed four schools each season to play seven rather than eight conference 
games. 
</P>
<P>
This allowed schools to use the extra date to schedule another nonconference 
game, but Hurd said athletic directors were concerned that the uneven number of 
conference games put schools at a disadvantage when it came to determining the 
WAC champion and the Holiday Bowl berth. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU used the uneven scheduling to eliminate a home-and-home series with 
Colorado State for 1989 and 1990. The change will not affect the Aztecs until 
1993, when they again would have been permitted to drop a conference game. 
</P>
<P>
The plan still must be approved by the conference presidents at their annual 
meeting in June 8-11 in Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, the 1991 conference basketball tournament was awarded to 
Wyoming. CURT HOLBREICHFOOTBALL Hollywood is interested in filming a story 
about former Vista High and Colorado quarterback Sal Aunese, who died of 
inoperable stomach cancer Sept. 23. Beverly Hills agent Ed Hookstratten has 
been retained by the Aunese family to represent its dealings with movie studios 
interested in the life of the late athlete. "I don't see it being done as a 
picture on TV; it's larger than that," Hookstratten said. "It's a theatrical 
motion picture and should be handled by the finest in the business." When he 
became ill in the spring of 1989, Aunese's teammates dedicated their season to 
him, then finished 11-0 and ranked No. 1 nationally. The Buffaloes can win the 
national championship by beating Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl on Jan. 
1.BASKETBALL Howard Wright, a former Patrick Henry all-county player, returned 
to his high school and made his first six shots of the second half to break 
open a close game, leading Athletes In Action to a 114-92 exhibition victory 
over Christian Heritage College. The former Patriot who went on to play at 
Stanford scored a game-high 28 points and had eight rebounds. The Hawks were 
led by Mark Kraatz and Brad Soucie, who each had 23 points. Athletes In Action 
is now 8-21 and their collegiate tour will end Saturday at Loyola Marymount.

In what shapes up as one of the largest San Diego County land acquisitions by 
an industrial user in recent years, aerospace manufacturer General Dynamics 
said Thursday that it is in the process of buying a 60-acre parcel north of San 
Diego, large enough to accommodate a 1-million-square-foot complex of research 
and industrial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman Jack Isabel confirmed late Thursday that the General Dynamics 
Electronics Division is in escrow to purchase the property, but he declined to 
discuss details, including what and when General Dynamics plans to build, how 
much it will spend on the facility or how many employees will be working at the 
new complex. 
</P>
<P>
The land is in the 4S Ranch Business Park, part of a massive 3,600-acre 
development in unincorporated San Diego County about 20 miles north of downtown 
San Diego. The property, situated just west of San Diego's Rancho Bernardo 
suburb, is owned by the Ralphs family, founders of the 120-store chain of 
supermarkets of the same name. The family sold its interest in the supermarkets 
in 1969, however. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics' Electronics Division primarily makes testing equipment used 
for military aircraft, including the F-16 jet fighter, the B-2 Stealth bomber 
and the C-17 cargo plane, which is under development. The division also makes 
aircraft radios. Exactly what the division will make at the new facility was 
unclear Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its Electronics Division, General Dynamics also has Convair and 
Defense Systems divisions in San Diego, which manufacture Tomahawk cruise 
missiles and Atlas rockets. With 17,500 employees in San Diego, General 
Dynamics is the city's largest industrial employer, spokesman Isabel said. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics' purchase of the property is expected to close by the end of 
this year, sources said. The developers recently received permission from the 
county to combine several industrial pads, or lots, to make the 60-acre parcel, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the impending purchase comes at a time when General Dynamics and other 
local defense manufacturers are expecting significant cuts in the federal 
defense budget, cuts that are bound to affect San Diego's economy and payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
At its new location, General Dynamics will have several large manufacturers as 
neighbors. The 4S Ranch Business Park, now under construction, is next to 
Rancho Bernardo Industrial Park, where companies including Sony, 
Hewlett-Packard, NCR, Unisys and Norther Telecom operate huge plants. 
</P>
<P>
The 4S Ranch has been in the Ralphs family since 1938, when Albert Ralphs, son 
of the supermarket chain's founder, bought it as a family recreation area. His 
grandson Tom Ralphs has spearheaded the family's efforts to develop the 
property since 1979. He received approval in 1984 from the county to develop 
634 acres of the property, with the rest set aside for development at least 
until after 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Ralphs, 42, and Bob Hallock, 43, the general partners in the 4S Ranch 
development, declined to comment on the General Dynamics deal, saying only that 
a 60-acre parcel in their business park is in escrow. They did discuss their 
plans in general for the $100-million first phase of development at 4S Ranch, 
saying the business park component will total 180 acres, enough for about 3 
million square feet of research and light-industrial space. They said they also 
plan to build up to 500 housing units in the first phase. 
</P>
<P>
Ralphs and Hallock said they have already sold 90% of the lots in the 180-acre 
business park to users, including Hawthorne Machinery, Alcoa, Reliable Tool and 
Trammell Crow.

ARCHITECTURE: CHANGES NEEDED IN ESCONDIDO CIVIC CENTER'S PHASE TWO

<P>
The problem of designing a large theater has challenges similar to those in 
creating a convention center: A large, boxy space must somehow be concealed 
within a graceful shell. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Arthur Erickson, using repetitive, bold forms in concrete, has made 
the gigantic new San Diego Convention Center a fine piece of design. His 
excellent exterior detailing makes this building attractive to those arriving 
by car or foot. 
</P>
<P>
It's a landmark downtown project for downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Architects Moore Ruble Yudell haven't been nearly as successful in their design 
of the second phase of Escondido's Civic Center, a $55.4-million complex that 
includes 1,500- and 400-seat theaters for stage productions. 
</P>
<P>
The final design for the project, to be built in Grape Day Park downtown, which 
includes the new City Hall completed in 1988, was unanimously approved by the 
Escondido City Council last week. 
</P>
<P>
The city hopes to break ground next fall, with completion expected in 1993. In 
addition to the theaters, the project will have an arts complex and a community 
meeting center. 
</P>
<P>
Although the architects have created wonderful outdoor spaces, the bulky 
100-foot-tall "fly tower," which houses the mechanical equipment above the 
stage, sticks out like a sore thumb, unbroken by architectural detailing or 
other visual devices that could make it attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Other potential problems include jarring combinations of roof treatments and a 
confusing variety of window and wall treatments used in an attempt to break 
down the main theater's mass. There is also 
</P>
<P>
a possibility that the Civic Center complex will have insufficient daytime 
attractions -- food stands, recreation and other forms of enjoyment -- to make 
the park a success as a people place. 
</P>
<P>
Months of refining should have resulted in a well-composed treatment of the big 
box that will house the necessary stage equipment over the main theater; at 100 
feet, this "fly tower" will be the Civic Center's tallest, most massive 
feature. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the theater, at least as depicted in model form, will sit hard by 
Escondido Boulevard, bulk unbroken by details that could tie it to the rest of 
the Civic Center complex -- it's flat roof setting it oddly apart from the 
pavilion or gable roofs used on the rest of the new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Project architect Renzo Zecchetto admitted that softening the impact of this 
looming box was the architects' single toughest challenge. Instead of calling 
attention to this mass with architectural fussiness, the designers elected to 
place most of the design interest at the middle level of this and the other 
buildings in the second phase of the Civic Center project. Groups of small 
windows, varied wall angles and assorted architectural detailing will break 
these facades into forms a human can get close to without feeling overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, instead of causing the larger theater's bulk to fade into the background, 
the lack of detailing up high only makes it stick out like the proverbial sore 
thumb, at least on the model. 
</P>
<P>
But the architects aren't finished yet, Zecchetto said. City officials and 
community leaders have expressed a desire for some softening of the theater's 
harsh mass. Options include a screening wall in front of the building's 
prominent northern face, detailing on the building wall itself or a system of 
vine-covered trellises and palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
Zecchetto said the architects favor the last approach, partly because it is 
most economical. 
</P>
<P>
At this stage of the design game, though, when at least a year has already gone 
into the project, one expects a more polished design solution. 
</P>
<P>
Other aspects of the architecture are also disappointing. The choice of roof 
forms is puzzling. Some roofs will have the traditional pitched form, while 
others, as on a few small towers, will be flat. Sometimes, the flat towers 
don't merge well with the slanted roofs nearby. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult, though, to make a final pronouncement on these roofs. The 
material hasn't been chosen, and could make the actual buildings look much 
different than a cardboard model. Flat tiles or a seamed metal are among the 
options being considered. 
</P>
<P>
There is other evidence the architects didn't arrive at a totally coherent 
design vision, the type of consistency which makes the new City Hall by Pacific 
Associates Planners and Architects of San Diego such a success. 
</P>
<P>
Pedestrians won't notice from the ground level, but there's something jarring 
about the way the big theater's northern wall drops from a flat roof on top to 
a slanted roof above the first floor, with twin buttresses flying above it. 
</P>
<P>
Along Escondido Boulevard, the architects have softened the theater's mass with 
many combinations of windows and wall forms, but the array of shapes and angles 
seems jarring, at least on the model. 
</P>
<P>
At the level of the pedestrian, the architects appear to have done their 
strongest design work. 
</P>
<P>
All along, the design of the entire Civic Center complex, including City Hall, 
has been driven by its location in the 17-acre Grape Day Park, Escondido's 
miniature Balboa Park, a huge chunk of open space in the heart of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The intention was always to keep this setting park-like, even with the addition 
of several new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Moore Ruble Yudell responded by pushing their buildings to the edges of the 
property, near the streets, preserving the interior as open space. A walk 
through the complex should prove to be an interesting stroll between the 
various plazas and courtyards. 
</P>
<P>
The main entrance to the new theater complex will be off Escondido Boulevard on 
the western edge of the project. Here, a wide plaza of slightly ascending 
levels will lead pedestrians in between the large theater to the north and the 
nearby community theater, set behind a pergola at Escondido Boulevard and 
Valley Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
Pergolas here and elsewhere are the same sort of vine-covered 
column-and-trellis outdoor walkways that became legendary San Diego architect 
Irving Gill's trademark early this century. Some even use arches like the ones 
Gill favored. The pergolas, with many rows of trees, will soften the experience 
of entering the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Every building has at least one courtyard related to it; most have several. 
Some are intended to be used for various gatherings. A courtyard off the back 
of the smaller theater could become an outdoor performance space, Zecchetto 
said. Eventually, he hopes the city will have the money to add doors to the 
back of this theater's stage so that it can open to the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the architecture, a larger concern has to do with the programming of 
the Civic Center complex, the kinds of uses selected for this public park. City 
Hall and theaters will dominate the site, with the community meeting building 
and arts complex as secondary uses. What will the new complex offer the person 
who comes to the park in search of a recreational or cultural experience during 
daylight hours? 
</P>
<P>
A library might have been a good choice, but the city had already built a new 
one three blocks away at 2nd Avenue and Kalmia Street in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
There are no now concrete plans for the kinds of things that make Balboa Park a 
success: food pushcarts, small cafes, a variety of spontaneous performers and 
many choices of exhibitions, performances, films and museums. 
</P>
<P>
Both Zecchetto and Rolf Gunnarson, assistant executive director of Escondido's 
Community Development Commission, say they have considered such ideas. A small 
food outlet and bar in the lobby of the larger theater might be open during 
daylight hours, and a kitchen in the community meeting building could be used 
to produce food for park visitors, not just for meetings within the building. 
Food vendors are also a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
These kinds of people-oriented uses will be essential to animating the 
well-planned outdoor spaces, which will undoubtedly by the new complex's 
triumph.

Too Long: Former televangelist Jim Bakker got backing Thursday from the North 
Carolina Council of Churches, which said the 45-year prison sentence he got was 
too harsh. The council, representing 25 denominations, does not defend Bakker's 
illegal acts but contends the term was unfair compared with punishment of other 
white-collar criminals, said Collins Kilburn, executive director. Iran-Contra 
figure Oliver North got a three-year suspended sentence and two years 
probation. Wall Street raider Ivan Boesky received a three-year sentence. 
"Maybe there was a little too much secret glee in the hearts of some" because 
"Bakker had the book thrown at him. He's human too," Kilburn said.

THE 'PRICE OF A PAL' STRIKES A CHORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a practicing veterinarian and president of the Southern California 
Veterinary Medical Assn. (SCVMA), which represents more than 1,000 
veterinarians in the greater Los Angeles area, I would like to take issue with 
the article "What Price a Pal?" 
</P>
<P>
I am appreciative that The Times is willing to devote space to the profession 
of veterinary medicine. However, it is my belief that the article in question 
painted a "not true" impression of veterinary costs and practitioner attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question that, with the advancement in veterinary care today, 
almost any procedure that is available to humans is also available to animals. 
When these new elective procedures are sought by the pet-owning public, 
substantial costs can be generated. However, similar procedures in human 
medicine cost tenfold more than the same procedures in veterinary medicine. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, the average veterinary bill is far below the figures quoted in the 
article, and alternative funding options are readily available for those 
services that are expensive. Pet insurance is easily available for a moderate 
fee for both accidental and major medical eventualities. In addition, many 
veterinarians are willing to work out payment plans, while others simply absorb 
expenses or reduce fees to assist deserving clients and their animal patients.

THE 'PRICE OF A PAL' STRIKES A CHORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding veterinary costs, the subject is a microcosm of the dilemma with 
human medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
The advance of medical insurance and charity meant the doctor did not have to 
discuss his bill with the patient. It was sent along to the insurance company 
and the full amount was paid. 
</P>
<P>
The insured didn't care how much the doctor was charging because the insurance 
company paid. The insurance companies simply raised their premiums. The 
employers who paid those premiums used the tax system as a cost of doing 
business. Ever since socialized medicine has been discussed, putting a lid on 
how much will be paid to the medical establishment, doctors have been 
frightened into charging more and more to reap as much money as they can before 
the free lunch is over. They have diversified into drug stores, hospitals, 
insurance companies (talk about monopolies). 
</P>
<P>
Now the veterinarians have started down the same path. Your article states that 
there is a "recession" among the veterinary profession. Maybe people simply 
cannot afford to take their pets to pet hospitals as much as before. Insurance 
and charity are the cause of inflation for the care of animals, not the cure. 
</P>
<P>
Keep the veterinary doctors competitive by putting pressure on them to keep 
costs reasonable instead of seeking ways to protect a guaranteed financial 
expectation. There are no sacred, immune professions.

I went to veterinary school, believe it or not, because I have an extreme 
affection for animals and wanted to devote my life to alleviating their 
suffering. What I learned there fascinated and excited me, and made me realize 
there was some good to be done. But I paid the same for my education as the 
students of human medicine at the same university. I cannot afford to give my 
education away. A decade ago, the starting salary for a first-year veterinarian 
averaged around $21,000 a year. Today, that average is only about $26,000. 
</P>
<P>
As for Tannenbaum's suggestion that computer billing is leading to "fee 
desensitization" and a diminishing client-veterinarian relationship, I say 
"Bull!" Computer billing is becoming more and more a necessity in today's 
silicon chip society. Especially for larger practices, whose professional 
computer systems contain not only billing programs, but patient records, 
invoicing, pharmacy records, laboratory information and employee time logging. 
"The friendly doctor" is not gone. He or she is just able to use time and 
resources more efficiently.

nibbling buttered popcorn while wearing a fur coat -- furtively at home, or 
with all the pizazz of show biz at the annual Cedars-Sinai Women's Guild's 
movie premiere. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 32 years the Women's Guild premiere has been the one gala when 
it's cold enough, formal enough and glitzy enough to take the mink to the 
movies. "This is the night you buy the new ball gown for," said Guild President 
Marcia Ziffren. "You break out the jewels and put on the fur." 
</P>
<P>
What 1,100 guests were sumptuously gowned, jeweled and furred or black-tied for 
Wednesday night was the benefit premiere of Tri-Star's "Family Business" that 
began with a screening, chaired by Jackie Foster, at the Cineplex Odeon 
followed by dinner in the Century Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
This was a dinner where, in the words of premiere co-chair Nancy Zarif, "you 
get popcorn as an appetizer" -- and then a main course of sirloin slices served 
in a ballroom transformed into Manhattan by dozens of translucent back-lit sets 
from TVI. Entertaining the guests, who included two of the film's stars, Sean 
Connery and Matthew Broderick (Dustin Hoffman was performing "Merchant of 
Venice" on Broadway), was a fiery 18-piece orchestra complete with three torch 
singers. 
</P>
<P>
Among those dining and dancing were Marvin Davis with wife Barbara (who had at 
least one twirl around the dance floor with People mag's "sexiest man alive," 
Connery); Creative Artist's Agency's Mike Ovitz with wife Judy, who was supper 
chair; Sony's dynamic duo, Jon Peters and Peter Guber; Universal's Tom Pollock 
with wife Peggy; the film's producer, Larry Gordon; Leonard and Wendy Goldberg; 
Kirk and Anne Douglas; Danny Glover; and directors Brian DePalma and Barry 
Levinson. 
</P>
<P>
By midnight, the plug was pulled on the band, $600,000 had been raised for 
Cedars, and a flock of furs were on their way back to storage.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: INFORM PARENTS ABOUT DIVORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: After six years in a lousy marriage, my sister is finally 
getting a divorce. Even though our parents didn't like her husband, she still 
can't seem to find the courage to tell them. Yet she doesn't want to me to 
break the news. This seems so childish to me. What's wrong with her? -- S.K.W. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR S.K.W.: Telling parents about a divorce is often very difficult for adult 
children, especially if they're still hanging on to close family ties. Your 
sister is probably anticipating trouble when your parents may actually be 
relieved. Often, parents are more aware of trouble than children know. 
</P>
<P>
If your sister has children, your parents may be anxious about maintaining a 
close relationship with the youngsters and they need to be reassured that there 
will be no problem about this. Grandparents are always important in the lives 
of youngsters but when there are marital difficulties, they become even more 
important because they represent permanence and consistency in the child's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Your sister shouldn't be afraid to let your parents know that she'll need their 
emotional support. She shouldn't try to hide her feelings because it won't 
work. Parents are much too adept at seeing through such disguises. If you have 
any influence over your sister, encourage her to inform your parents -- and as 
soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My best girlfriend confessed to me that she'd heard 
consistent rumors about her husband's infidelity. When this happened, she 
invariably walked away from the person tossing out the hints. She says that she 
doesn't want to know if he's cheating. 
</P>
<P>
I find this almost impossible to understand. I'd be angry and hurt and would 
raise hell if I knew my husband was involved with another woman. Am I crazy or 
is my girlfriend? -- D.B. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR D.B.: If this friend means what she says, she's either emotionally 
involved with someone else herself or has such a low self-esteem that she 
thinks she's lucky to get any man, no matter how badly he treats her. It's 
possible, however, that she may be trying to protect herself from the truth 
because she's not prepared to face it. 
</P>
<P>
Once a woman accuses her spouse of infidelity, she has to be ready to decide on 
a plan of action if he admits to an extramarital affair. Sometimes, women are 
wise to delay any confrontation because the husband may lose interest. Some 
women prefer to concentrate on trying to improve their relationship, hoping the 
problem may disappear. 
</P>
<P>
The ostrich approach to infidelity is dangerous, because if a woman waits too 
long, her chances for improving her life in case there is a divorce tend to 
diminish.

REASONS FOR GLUCOSE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: An uncle of mine was referred for a glucose test because his doctor 
thought that he had diabetes. It turned out that his glucose level was not 
normal, but that he doesn't have diabetes. I thought that diabetes meant that 
you did not have a normal glucose level. What else could it be? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Diabetes is usually the cause of an abnormal blood glucose measurement. 
However, blood glucose also may be affected by severe stress, an overactive 
thyroid, pancreatic tumors and use of diuretics.

GRASS-ROOTS ORGANIZATION FITS PEACE ACTIVISM INTO BUSY LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE FOSTER, THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
AMHERST, Mass. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You know how it is today: People are very busy. Some want their commitments 
clearly defined and information digested for them in small, comprehensible 
bits. Even peace activists with a profound understanding of the issues may not 
have a lot of time to devote to them. 
</P>
<P>
Lois Barber understands this. This grass-roots organizer on nuclear disarmament 
issues has started a peace organization tailored to today's sound-bite life 
style. In 20/20 Vision, a person can work for peace by spending $20 a year and 
only 20 minutes a month. In the process, members also develop networking skills 
and get feedback on progress. 
</P>
<P>
It may sound like McNugget organizing, but in three years, the group, run out 
of small offices in Amherst and Albany, Calif., has started 30 chapters and is 
developing a workbook to make further replication easier. In December, Barber 
received a Giraffe Project award, given to individuals who stick their necks 
out by "helping people believe in their own ability to create a better world." 
</P>
<P>
"I realized that there were millions of citizens who wanted to see an end to 
the arms race but didn't know what they could do about it," Barber said, 
rummaging through files in 20/20's small but comfortable offices across from 
the Amherst town green. "They were overwhelmed by the immensity of the problem, 
by the legislative process. And people are very, very busy. 
</P>
<P>
"We're offering a service, finding people the most effective action they can do 
every month to achieve three goals: ending the arms race, reducing the risk of 
nuclear war and increasing world security." 
</P>
<P>
For each chapter, a half-dozen or so volunteer researchers spend three to five 
hours a month calling legislative specialists for leading peace and 
arms-control organizations, such as the Union of Concerned Scientists, the 
Friends' Committee on National Legislation and the Council for a Livable World. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers each ask two specialists to recommend the most effective action 
people in their district could take that would require only 20 minutes. "They 
don't laugh because they know with ordinary citizens, that's all you're going 
to get," Barber said. The researchers meet monthly to discuss the 
recommendations and choose the most effective. Then they send postcards to 
20/20 Vision subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
"People get so much mail these days, we just send a postcard," Barber said. 
"All it has on it is one subject with brief background, one recommended action, 
and all the names and addresses a member will need." Depending on the action, 
as Barber calls it, subscribers may write to state legislators, the media, 
private organizations or people in the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
"One group who phones the Physicians for Social Research might hear that the 
most effective thing would be to write to Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) and ask him 
to vote for the comprehensive test ban," Barber said. Another group might 
decide to ask subscribers to write to Rep. Silvio O. Conte (R-Mass.) and "ask 
him to review his position on funding for the Trident II." 
</P>
<P>
Her idea had been in operation only six months when Jeremy Sherman, heir to the 
Midas Muffler fortune, heard about it. Sherman, who lives in Albany, had been 
active in the efforts to end world hunger. 
</P>
<P>
"I noticed how much material created by our movement was designed to inspire 
people to have convictions about issues, but how little of the material 
actually gave citizens concrete ways to translate their convictions into 
influence on policy-makers," Sherman said. "I was looking for something that 
was quick and convenient to do on a regular basis." 
</P>
<P>
So the two, living on opposite coasts, joined forces to duplicate Barber's 
project elsewhere. So far, there are 3,000 subscribers, with two of the groups 
having 400 each. Sherman says this move has sprung out of the changing 
political climate in the country; no more is activism effectively expressed in 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize if you're going to make deep changes on a long-term basis, you 
can't leave it up to a few individuals," he said. "The way change works in our 
democracy is you've got to bring all other people in the middle and widen the 
circle. To do that, you have to ask them to do something that can fit into 
their already busy lives. We're trying to set our sights accurately for the 
long haul." 
</P>
<P>
While the activism that is impelling him is '60s-strong, the parlance is pure 
'80s. "Let's come up with a task that is maximum effective and commensurate 
with the amount of energy that people can come up with," Sherman said. That 
fits right in with the business viewpoint he brings to the collaboration. 
</P>
<P>
His father, who started Midas Mufflers, "was a very active progressive 
himself," Sherman said. "We both had an interest in trying to bring 
technological franchising to the political arena. Good projects being developed 
locally could be replicated and used in other parts of the country. Franchising 
is really the technology of replicating what's essential in effective programs 
while allowing them to adapt to local needs." 
</P>
<P>
Where does the $20 go? Barber is ready with the answer: It pays for the phone 
calls to the legislative assistants and postcards to the subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
20/20 Vision makes it easy for the district projects: "We give them promotional 
material ready to roll if they want it and administrative tools, like software 
for managing their subscription lists. We're trying to make it so local groups 
don't have to spend a lot of time reinventing the wheel. They can put their 
time into the creative aspects." 
</P>
<P>
One dollar of the money goes into forming new groups, and 20/20 Vision gets 
outside funding as well, some of which pays for office overhead. 
</P>
<P>
How does the group measure success? Every six months, each project sends out a 
newsletter that reports on all the actions taken and their results. Several 
reports show a subtle pattern of changed votes and modified stances. 
</P>
<P>
"Our responsibility is not to take credit but to make sure that individuals are 
clearly expressing to their congress-person what they want to happen," Barber 
said. "If you have the right facts and can communicate to the right person at 
the right time and if you do it with a lot of other people who are bringing the 
same message, it's an extremely powerful way to influence decision makers. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically we're making our democracy work the way it's supposed to."

AN EXPERIMENT IN STRETCHING THE WORK FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN YAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Williams and his co-workers scrunched their necks, heads lolling from one 
side to the other. They weren't in an aerobics studio, but rather in a grimy 
Santa Monica city repair facility. 
</P>
<P>
Before getting down to work each day, the men, in regular work clothes, 
exercise as part of a one-year test program of mandatory exercise to see 
whether the city can prevent many work-related injuries and reduce the amount 
of money it must pay for workers' compensation. 
</P>
<P>
"You feel a little more limber," said Williams, one of at least 60 city 
employees who have been taught how to lead co-workers in exercises since the 
program began three months ago. "I don't want to be 65 years old and have my 
chest near my knees because my hamstrings are too tight." 
</P>
<P>
Although private U.S. companies have followed the Japanese in requiring 
employees to exercise, Santa Monica is one of the first employers in the public 
sector to make the practice mandatory. The city spent about $14,000 for 
training, stretching videos, newsletters and occasional checkups from Athletes 
in Industry, the injury-prevention company it hired. 
</P>
<P>
City Risk Manager Tom Phillips, whose office was created three years ago, said 
Santa Monica is focusing on prevention because on-the-job injuries, medical and 
insurance costs and the city's liability for injuries are all rising. The city 
is "permissibly uninsured," he said, which means that it pays for job-related 
injuries out of its own coffers. 
</P>
<P>
Except for those with doctors' excuses, the stretch routine is mandatory for 
the 580 employees in the General Services and Police departments, which make up 
40% of the city's work force but claim 60% of workers' compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Workers in these two departments, Phillips' office found, are more susceptible 
than others to preventable injuries, sprains and strains. From a cold start, 
after sitting in cars, police officers must be able to sprint after suspects. 
Mechanics have to wiggle 1,000-pound tires onto tractors. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like an athlete has to get their muscles warmed up . . . so must a person 
engaged in industry," Phillips said. "If the results are successful, I can see 
it expanded to other departments." 
</P>
<P>
For six to eight minutes at the start of each shift, workers reach for the sky, 
hands above their heads. They squat, stretch to each side and do a series of 
other stretches, holding each pose for about 10 seconds. Done regularly, the 12 
stretching exercises are expected to increase muscle flexibility. Early next 
year, Phillips plans to meet with exercise team leaders and evaluate the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Williams said, employees griped about the stretching and doubted that 
the program would work. Those who did stretch got wolf howls and teasing 
comments from workers in other departments. "We're out here like ballerinas 
doing this thing," said the 6-foot, 6-inch mechanic, raising his hands above 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
Some General Services workers are enthusiastic about the exercises. They say 
they like spending time together before splitting to different ends of the 
shop. They say the routine has raised morale and cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
But the reaction from police isn't so positive. One word written on an exercise 
poster in the roll-call room expresses some patrol officers' opinion of the 
program: STUPID. 
</P>
<P>
Officers complain that the 30 pounds of equipment on their belts prevents them 
from really stretching and bending. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the guys are apathetic about it. It's extremely impractical to do 
(considering) what we wear and the time we have to do it," said Officer Gary 
Herman, who has won medals for weightlifting in international competition. But 
even he acknowledges the importance of stretching, having torn leg muscles in a 
foot chase. 
</P>
<P>
Police also complain that if they rip their uniforms when they stretch, it's 
unlikely that the city will pay to replace or repair them. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, officers say they lose training time to the stretch routine. 
</P>
<P>
But some think it's worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"We have such a limited time for our squad meeting, which is usually 25 
minutes, it's hard to fit the program in," said patrol Lt. Al Bonar. "Maybe we 
give up a little training to have something like this, because if we don't, we 
lose officers to injury on duty." 
</P>
<P>
Herman said the program would work better if officers were paid to come in 
early for the mandatory routine and allowed to wear sweat suits. 
</P>
<P>
For fiscal year 1988-89, Santa Monica paid about $2 million in workers' 
compensation, $1.2 million of it to General Services and police. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said that figure reversed a trend of increasing compensation bills. In 
fiscal 1987-88, the city paid out about $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to workers' compensation, he said, the city pays about an equal 
amount each year in overtime and on hiring or training people to take over for 
the injured. 
</P>
<P>
The stretches do not take the body beyond normal office movements, Phillips 
said. He said seven employees have either claimed workers' compensation due to 
injury from stretches or notified his office that they may have suffered from 
the stretches. He attributed most of the complaints to resistance to change 
because five of them originated in the first month of the program. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to motivate people to be safe," said Phillips, pointing out that 
few employees used the city's free, voluntary health program. "People are just 
preoccupied with doing other things: 'Got my job to do, my family to take care 
of, bills to pay.' 
</P>
<P>
"I think employee morale can go up in a program like this. If you feel good 
about the organization you work for, you can be a more productive employee."

Sallinen Premiere Expected in L.A.: Peter Hemmings, general director of Los 
Angeles Music Center Opera, is expected to announce the world premiere today of 
Aulis Sallinen's fourth opera, "Kullervo," at the Music Center in early 1992. 
Hemmings will make the announcement in Helsinki, Finland, jointly with Ilkka 
Kuusisto, general manager of Finnish National Opera, which will produce the 
work at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Feb. 22-March 1, 1992, in association 
with LAMCO. The Finnish contingent will furnish the leading singers -- led by 
baritone Jorma Hynninen, who is artistic director of the Finnish company -- the 
chorus and conductor Ulf Soderblom. The composer has fashioned his own libretto 
for "Kullervo," loosely basing it on the play "Kullervo" by the 19th-Century 
Finnish playwright Aleksis Kivi. SHAUNA SNOW

Hollywood Memorabilia Up for Grabs: Ever wanted to dress up as Judah Ben-Hur 
facing off against Rome's greatest charioteers in the Colosseum? If so, put in 
your bid this afternoon to Sotheby's in New York, which is offering these and 
59 other items in a special auction of Hollywood memorabilia. Among the more 
talked-about pieces on the block at 2 p.m. today are a red sequined evening 
gown worn by Marilyn Monroe in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (expected to fetch 
$8,000 to $12,000), a bowler hat worn by Charlie Chaplin while filming "City 
Lights" ($6,000 to $8,000) and Judy Garland's blue-and-white cotton dress in 
"The Wizard of Oz" ($20,000 to $25,000). Also to be auctioned is the 
17-by-37-foot backdrop used by Alfred Hitchcock in his 1945 film, "Spellbound." 
The massive painting, designed by surrealist Salvador Dali, is expected to 
bring the auction's top price: an estimated $80,000. SHAUNA SNOW

Petition for 'Homeroom': Parents and teachers in Watts have vowed to petition 
ABC to save "Homeroom," a canceled half-hour comedy series they say helps keep 
their kids in school. "All we're saying is give the show a chance," said Jim 
Goins, who counsels school dropouts in the Watts area. "There's not that many 
shows of color that deal with educational issues, and we're in a dilemma right 
now as far as having black male role models," Goins said. "Homeroom" stars 
Darryl Sivad as a man who gave up a lucrative job in advertising to teach at an 
inner-city school. SHAUNA SNOW

DE NIRO AND PENN TRY TO WING IT IN 'WE'RE NO ANGELS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "We're No Angels" (citywide), Robert De Niro and Sean Penn are cast as 
dim-bulb characters, reminiscent of the low-lifes in "Stranger Than Paradise," 
or even of the Dead End Kids. As these slow-witted, would-be streetwise 
goofballs try to navigate their way through the movie, their faces screw up 
into bizarre contortions or dissolve in empty panic. 
</P>
<P>
De Niro and Penn have played dumb before. De Niro had his punchy moments in 
"Raging Bull" and Penn became famous doing the drug-addled surfer Spicoli in 
"Fast Times at Ridgemont High." But here, they're dumb on a fuller level: two 
guys who don't have a clue and keep miraculously faking their way along anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Their arias of idiocy waiver all the way between shameless over-acting and 
inspired foolery. But director Neil Jordan and writer David Mamet's tale of 
escaped convicts disguised as priests in a 1930s era Northeast border town has 
its charms. It's a comedy about dumb luck, fortuitous grace, about two sinners 
redeemed by absurd awe-inspiring flukes. And, though it's a flawed work that 
never jells, a comedy that exposes its serious side too readily, it keeps 
getting eerie little grace notes. 
</P>
<P>
Mamet obviously wants to suggest a kinship between the escaped cons, De Niro's 
Ned and Penn's Jim, and the monks who take them in. Emotionally, they're all 
alienated from the outside world. The cons' edginess can also be read as piety, 
and their jailhouse demeanor -- watchful, sneaky-sly -- as gravity. So there's 
a symbiosis. Ned and Jim grow into their roles, do good despite themselves. 
They're like the whiskey priest in Graham Greene's "The Power and the Glory." 
The cloth takes them over. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is set during the Depression and the town, created from scratch by 
production designer Wolf Kroeger, is a dingy, muddy, wind-swept frontier city 
that recalls the locale of Robert Altman's "McCabe and Mrs. Miller." In this 
impoverished setting, even the opulent church has a leaky roof. That's why 
their "miraculous" Madonna seems to be crying. And, against this desperation, 
both the wild license of the escaped killer, Bobby (James Russo) -- who can 
sneak a gun into an execution -- and the mad despotism of the warden (the late 
Ray McAnally) show the frontier spirit at its scariest extreme. 
</P>
<P>
Ned and Jim are innocents trapped between maniacs. They're caught between an 
"evil" and a "good," equally deranged and dangerous, and their only hope is to 
con their way across the bridge and border in the annual pilgrimage. When, like 
buddy-buddy Alices in a cold Wonderland, they find an epigram on hospitality 
from the Bible, in the middle of wintry desolation, it's like the precursor in 
a fairy-tale, or parable. 
</P>
<P>
"We're No Angels" is full of interesting things. It's a more intelligent, 
daring, textured work than many recent big studio movies. But it's a 
disappointment, because of the superb talent involved, not just De Niro and 
Penn, but cinematographer Philippe Rousselot, Mamet and Jordan. The film is 
less funny than it should be, less hypnotic. It never really establishes an 
imaginative equilibrium, and some of the performances are pitched in too broad 
a key. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, whose films are often brilliant on both cinematic and literary levels, 
fell badly with farce his last time out -- the ruinously edited "High Spirits" 
-- and his temperament may be a little too intense for this material. An 
Irishman, from a Catholic country, he obviously responds to the impudence of 
the convict-priests notion and, as "Company of Wolves" and "High Spirits" both 
show, he has always liked fairy tale forms. But he may be making a mistake in 
trying to impose his view -- special, fervid, highly poetic -- in even slightly 
formula American movies. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, his sensibility never quite connects with Mamet's. Like the whimsical 
Bill Forsyth and the moralistic John Sayles in "Breaking In," they may even 
work against each other. Mamet's austerity, the almost emotionless performances 
he coaxes from his actors as a director, suggest a different key than the 
feverish, volcanic intensity Jordan likes to get. Jordan's characters sweat and 
batter at their bars, cry against their fate, while Mamet specializes in dry 
maneuvers and measured cynicism. He's more fascinated with the game, Jordan 
with the torment of the players. 
</P>
<P>
In the friendly acting contest between De Niro and Penn, Penn makes some canny 
scores. De Niro takes the gruff, embittered, knit-eyebrows stance he used for 
his bounty hunter in "Midnight Run" and takes it further. He digs himself in, 
plants his face like a clenched fist, and works up four or five comic glowers 
and variations on wary, disguised hostility. He also has a hilarious confession 
scene with Bruno Kirby as a sex-crazed deputy. 
</P>
<P>
But Penn's dazed Jim is a real surprise, particularly after his virulent 
machismo turn in "Casualties of War." Despite his rebellious, taciturn image, 
Penn plays him incongruously sweet. Jim's spiritual metamorphosis is a joke, 
but it's a tender joke infused with some awe and grace. "We're No Angels" (MPAA 
rated R for sex, violence, language and nudity) proves that a great ensemble is 
no guarantee of a great movie -- but it also proves that the misses of the 
brilliant can still give you something extraordinary.

case of clashing creative temperaments; perhaps an unjelled idea.

ETHNIC EATING: GRILLED CHICKEN FOR THE AGES AT KOKEKOKKO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's an old saying about resourceful cooks using every portion of a pig but 
the squeal. Well, even the "squeal" -- or in this case, the "cluck" -- is used 
at Kokekokko. 
</P>
<P>
This Little Tokyo eating place specializes in grilled chicken -- the Japanese 
call it yakitori -- and makes amazingly thorough use of the bird. 
</P>
<P>
Livers, gizzards, leg meat, breast meat and skin -- you get them all in a 
series of snack-like courses. The parts of the chicken that don't appear on the 
plate no doubt are tossed into the pot to make the broth that accompanies the 
meal. 
</P>
<P>
It's a lively place with a woodsy log cabin look and is open only at night, 
much like the street stalls of Tokyo that dispense yakitori after dark. The 
atmosphere is as jovial and noisy as a sushi bar -- probably noisier due to the 
sizzle and hiss emanating from the grill. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the customers crowd around the counter, and the food is prepared and 
served a morsel at a time, like sushi. Almost everything is speared on wooden 
sticks and grilled over charcoal. Exceptions include sauteed chicken bits 
spooned over rice and chicken sashimi. 
</P>
<P>
You can order either a half-course of yakitori (five sticks) or a full-course 
(10 sticks), and if you are obviously unacquainted with yakitori customs, the 
cooks will ask how you like your meat (medium rare, well done) and check 
whether you eat livers and gizzards. 
</P>
<P>
I skipped the innards and selected medium rare on the cook's advice. 
</P>
<P>
First came a little cup containing crisp sweet green beans seasoned with 
sesame, soy sauce and sugar. The meal proper started with breast meat chunks 
lightly daubed with wasabi. Next, I had chicken meat wrapped around eggplant 
slices while a friend went for grilled livers that were perfectly cooked -- 
rare and tender inside, crisp outside. Then we tried skewers of chicken with 
green onions, chicken meatballs, salted chicken leg meat, leg meat with 
yakitori sauce, gizzards, grilled chicken skins and chicken wings. Toward the 
middle, we received a skewer of hard-boiled quail eggs, a green salad and 
broth. 
</P>
<P>
Yakitori sauce, which tastes much like teriyaki sauce, is the restaurant's own 
blend of seasonings and crucial to the reputation of its food. And Kokekokko's 
sauce is a good one. 
</P>
<P>
After consuming our 10 sticks, we ordered some of the dishes we saw prepared 
for other customers. Plump fresh shiitake mushrooms made a nice contrast to the 
long parade of meat. And then we tried two forms of chicken sashimi. First came 
the breast meat, shaved thin and wrapped around fine strands of the white part 
of green onion. The soy sauce-based dip that accompanied this included a raw 
quail egg. Next, the cook took out chicken leg meat that had been wrapped with 
the skin into a roll and frozen so that when sliced it looked like sausage. A 
few moments on the plate, however, and it thawed into a shapeless mass. Chopped 
green onion flavored its salty dipping sauce. 
</P>
<P>
We also tried the house special rice, which was topped with finely diced 
chicken seasoned with soy sauce, sugar and thin strips of nori (dried seaweed). 
We finished with big mugs of green tea. By then it was around 8 on a Monday 
night, and the restaurant was so crowded that standees filled the doorway. 
</P>
<P>
 Kokekokko Yakitori House, 203 S. Central Ave., Los Angeles. (213) 687-0690. 
Open Monday through Saturday 5:30 p.m. to midnight. MasterCard, Visa and Japan 
Credit Bureaucards accepted. Park on the street or in neighborhood lots. The 
full-course, 10-stick yakitori dinner is $18.50. The five-stick half-course is 
$11.

AN OUT-OF-THE-WAY PLACE WITH RIGHT-ON FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You bet it's a New Age. At Lozano, not only the waitperson introduces himself 
by name, so does the busperson. And when this personally introduced busperson 
drops off a plate of food and the dineperson politely says, "Thank you," he 
breezily replies, "No problem!" 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, one of the conventions of this talky New Age is that we dinepeople 
can immediately forget all these servepersons' names and address them as waiter 
or busboy. Even more fortunately, though, Lozano is a surprisingly good 
restaurant, with the emphasis on surprisingly. 
</P>
<P>
It's a stylish little place at the north end of Sierra Madre's minuscule 
downtown; a room where earth tones abound, where the walls are roughly 
plastered and the exposed air ducts are a muted shade of plum. And yet it 
serves burritos as thick as a stevedore's forearm and a hamburger approved by 
the American Heart Assn. Of all things, Lozano is an avant-garde 
Mexican-Southwestern restaurant where 90% of the dishes get the AHA shield. 
</P>
<P>
There are good soups to start with, particularly the black bean, a smooth puree 
with a pure, intense bean flavor. Black beans may also figure in the chili of 
the day, which is frankly presented as a soup rather than a thick stew, and 
always has a solid flavor of fresh ground peppers. Even the chicken soup has 
chunks of chicken with some flavor to them. 
</P>
<P>
The Wild Mountain Salad (recipe available at the door) has big chunks of jicama 
as well as corn and bits of tomato mixed with the lettuce. It tends to fly off 
the plate as you eat it, but no matter, since even a small plate is a generous 
portion. The other star salad is the cacophonous Smoked Chicken Salad, which 
includes walnuts, apple, red pickled onions and a dressing made with the most 
assertively berry-flavored of all raspberry vinegars. 
</P>
<P>
The stuffed pepper is gorgeously presented in a sea of red chile sauce with 
patterns of sour cream painted on it, looking eerily like a Westside dessert in 
a sea of raspberry sauce and creme anglaise. The pepper itself, which is 
perfunctorily stuffed with smoked chicken and cheese, is hotter than you might 
expect. The other appetizers are a little less impressive: coconut fried shrimp 
-- call them shrimp macaroons -- with an "island salsa" that seems to be made 
of diced beets; Aunt Jemima-like jalapeno corn cakes with a jam-like mango 
chutney. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are combination plates of tacos and enchiladas. The burritos 
are not available on the combo plates, and there are two things to note about 
them, apart from their huge size: the rice in the filling is brown, and you can 
choose either a simple red enchilada sauce or a peculiar "California style" 
sauce that is a paste of fried whole-wheat flour, like gravy without the meat 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
A number of things don't pretend to be Mexican or Southwestern. The jerk 
chicken, heavy on the allspice, is arrestingly spicy and comes with 
particularly good red cabbage coleslaw. The AHA burger comes on a whole-wheat 
bun, of course, with not only jack and cheddar but blue cheese. The patty is 
small but fresh-tasting, pretty good for this sort of health-burger. However, 
the French fries are some of the strangest in California. They're extremely 
brown, but limp, and for all their dark color they taste less done than just 
about any fries I've ever had. 
</P>
<P>
The desserts are nothing but cheesecakes and a surprisingly good home-made red 
yam flan that tastes like a remarkably smooth-textured pumpkin pie. 
</P>
<P>
It's rare to find a restaurant so far off the beaten track that's so far out of 
the ordinary, and extremely rare to find heart-healthy food that's so easy to 
like. With all its weirdness, I like Lozano. Personally. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurant Lozano, 44 N. Baldwin Ave., Sierra Madre. (818) 355-5945. Open for 
lunch and dinner seven days; Sunday brunch. Beer and wine. Street parking. 
American Express, Diners Club, MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, 
food only, $30-$40.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: A SUSBSTANTIAL PORTION OF AMERICANA AT MARY'S LAMB

Cute. That's the word for the new, larger Mary's Lamb, which has moved up 
Ventura Boulevard to 10820 in Studio City. (The phone number is (818) 
505-6120.) It's wholesome, all-American look -- stenciled floor, walls covered 
with quilts and creamers that look like cows -- goes perfectly with its 
wholesome, all-American food. 
</P>
<P>
Even at lunchtime, there's jam on the table -- to slather on top of the 
biscuits that are sitting in the breadbasket. Lunch offerings include a large 
</P>
<P>
chopped salad filled with large chunks of chicken, avocado, bacon and cheese. 
There are good sandwiches (the cheese and grilled-onion topped meatloaf is 
memorable), various pastas and a fritata or two. Dinner offerings are along the 
same lines, but more substantial. If you like, you can also eat food from the 
take-out section (including fine fried chicken) while sitting at your table. 
And don't forget the all-American desserts: the banana-walnut cake is straight 
off the farm. RUTH REICHL

This exhibition of works by Georgia O'Keeffe and her contemporaries is notable 
more for the illustriousness of the names than the paintings and drawings. Even 
O'Keeffe is poorly represented. Noteworthy, however, are her stunning charcoal 
drawing of a bulging "Banana Flower" done in 1934 and several of Marsden 
Hartley's paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Actually it is Hartley who shines in this grouping of such luminaries as Arthur 
Dove, Thomas Hart Benton and Joseph Stella. Hartley displays an unexpected 
sense of humor in the musical notation made from sea horses and shrimp of the 
1938 "Musical Sea Notes." More consistent with his intense nature is the "Fig 
Tree," a small gem of color and movement. 
</P>
<P>
In the adjoining space loving and insightful black-and-white photographs by Dan 
Budnik show the leathery O'Keeffe in her later years. (Marilyn Butler Gallery,

In Robert Glover's sculptures art imitates life, or more exactly nature. 
Long-time contributor to the L.A. sculpture scene, Glover shows 
less-than-life-size vertical pieces wrought from unglazed, buff-colored clay. 
All are roughly based on the upright cylinder, but Glover hand works the clay 
so that it lumps, coils and fans around itself in an upward motion that looks 
like aged bone fossilizing into weird organic shapes as we stand there. 
</P>
<P>
Glover has a knack for duplicating the randomly accumulating, yet still 
intelligent order of a coral reef or a shell. The conceptual twist here is 
that, like Stonehenge, the very placement and disposition of the works imply 
some votive and ritual function grafted onto organic matter by man; the tension 
between nature and society here adds interest. More than Glover's squat mounds 
of pewter and terra cotta (also on view), the blanched clay works have a 
puzzling grace that is appealing and sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view are large acrylic and pastel abstract drawings by Roberta 
Eisenberg. The good news here is that Eisenberg's very personal, sure-handed 
Abstract Expressionism doesn't seem rehashed and you don't need to read titles 
like "Submersion" or "Breakthrough" to feel these phenomena moving through bold 
swaths of sky blue, grayed whites and black. (Space Gallery, 6015 Santa Monica

Still in his 20s, New Yorker Gary Simmons is certainly an artist to watch. His 
series of conceptually based three-dimensional pieces with schoolroom themes 
are acute visual metaphors that circle around education and political freedom. 
Rows of pint-sized rostrums each outfitted with a microphone tilted at the same 
angle ("Private Schoolroom") suggest thoughts about the ubiquity of mass 
communications, the fragility of First Amendment rights and the power of 
children -- as vocal consumers today, full-fledged voters tomorrow. An 
elementary school coat rack holding neatly aligned midget-sized Ku Klux Klan 
hoods and robes ("Six X") gives one pause: Imagine, a new generation of tidy 
little bigots, already inculcated with perverse beliefs.

"Disinformation Paragraph," a wall piece, consists of different-sized framed 
lengths of blank chalkboard arranged like words in a paragraph. Any message one 
might write with the pieces of black chalk is only temporary, subject to swift 
eradication or alteration -- as is disinformation, the false information leaked 
by a government as part of its intelligence operations. (Roy Boyd Gallery, 1547

In the darkness Christian Boltanski's altar-like memorials to nameless children 
glow like votive candles or sad, dim memories of war victims. Almost identical 
to the pieces he showed at the Museum of Contemporary Art last year, the 
wall-mounted grainy photos, biscuit tins, memento boxes and crudely wired 
electric lights express once again how closely Boltanski comes to creating 
contemporary sacred art (while tenaciously keeping alive its secular 
underpinnings). All the emotional components are there for making icons of the 
dead. Yet the gallery context acts as a subtle reminder that this is art, not 
religion, arguing for caution on the part of any viewer who might confuse them. 
</P>
<P>
After the blatant emotionalism of Boltanski, the clinical distance of Joseph 
Nechvatal feels all the more intellectual. His small red, high contrast, 
computer/robot generated images mix high technology with nature. The results 
are almost as unreadable as infrared photographs to the untrained eye as they 
pit their technical format against fragmented images of what look like 
enlargements of leaves and skin. In the next space are two intriguing found 
objects by Ann Messner that appear to embalm energy in lead as a way of 
suspending time. (Shoshana Wayne Gallery, 1454 5th St., to Jan. 13.) SUVAN GEER

Jon Kessler's large constructions mimic walls yet suggest whole buildings in 
abbreviated shorthand. Partly well crafted minimalist objects, the aluminum 
struts, wallboard and braces illuminated from the inside with fluorescent 
lights gain their edge from the way a single wall's construction can echo the 
overall configuration of a glass office building. Kessler pushes the poetry of 
that rather mundane observation along by seeing architecture's walls as 
curtains and using light to create a sense of theater. 
</P>
<P>
His most intriguing pieces are quite literally off the wall. They involve a 
roll of rusting fencing material and a light source on a motorized pulley that 
moves slowly up and down behind it. Ever changing shadows from the coiled 
material are cast onto a foggy piece of curved plastic for a lovely, albeit 
romantic, view of a building stripped down to its girders. 
</P>
<P>
Kessler seems to be trying to touch on issues like the economy by making credit 
cards block the light source on one piece. But the theatricality and genuine 
beauty of many of the light effects is too overwhelming to be disturbing. Even 
the refinery-in-a-crate synchronized lights of "American Landscape" are too 
charming to consider for long as a warning about the eventual depletion of 
natural resources. (Luhring Augustine Hetzler, 1330 4th St., to Jan. 13.) SUVAN

<P>
The closest thing to a New England, Currier and Ives Christmas that you are 
likely to find in L.A. is the Pacific Theatre Ensemble's production of Thornton 
Wilder's "The Long Christmas Dinner." 
</P>
<P>
The production is stark and lean, but the play's wistful resonances and 
decorative ambiance make the experience a Christmas dessert. 
</P>
<P>
You're greeted out front by carols sung by the cast, bundled up in their 
Victorian coats and dresses. Once inside, seated in the wooden, church-like 
pews, you warm to the treat of mulled wine and cider and more caroling, which 
segues into the play itself. 
</P>
<P>
As in Wilder's "Our Town," this play cleverly manipulates time. We watch 
characters from one family, as in time-lapse photography, celebrating Christmas 
dinner over the course of 90 years. Children become adults and then crones as 
members of the seven-member cast materialize as animated figures in an album 
with ensemble panache. 
</P>
<P>
And all this happens in a one-act that runs only a little more than an hour. 
The ensemble did the same show last year with some of the same cast, and 
artistic director Stephanie Shroyer has reconstructed the evening from D. Paul 
Yeuell's original staging. 
</P>
<P>
That staging unfolds with pristine focus. Even the squabbles -- for this is a 
real, not always cheery, family -- convey a poignancy. The production is 
vintage Wilder, the ritual of Christmas dinner (the food imaginary) lovingly 
recycled through an epoch of family births, deaths and rebirths. 
</P>
<P>
Not much seems to happen, but that's a deceptive tribute to the discipline of 
the cast (Sarah Hill, Vince Melocchi, Carla Obert, Sarah Zinsser, Michael 
Tulin, Deborah Scott and James Schultz). 
</P>
<P>
 At 705 1/2 Venice Blvd., Venice, Wednesday through Sunday, 8 p.m., through 
Dec. 23; matinees Saturdays and this Sunday, 5 p.m. Tickets: $13 (a dollar off 
with a canned food donation). (213) 660-3643. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Standard of Living' 
</P>
<P>
When Keith Reddin's Cold-War comedy, "Highest Standard of Living," premiered 
three years ago, the East-West paranoia in the play seemed timely enough. But 
glasnost and other events have quaintly dated it. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the characters are still funny, but the production at the Attic Theatre 
is ragged and unpolished. The set design, for example, is basically a clutter 
of furniture moved around between scenes. In Mitch Beer's staging, too many of 
the characters and scenes play like schematic, isolated acts. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Joseph Klein is charming in the lead role of a graduate student in Russia 
hurtled into paranoia when he's caught in KGB-CIA cross fire. He's strongly 
supported by Eden Bodnar's Soviet defector who follows him back to the United 
States (her Russian accent is perfectly pitched). 
</P>
<P>
For bravado and as an actor to watch, Don Bernhardt is hilarious as a Moscow 
street huckster in an aloha shirt, trying to hustle up a pair of jeans. 
Bernhardt doubles as a slick CIA lackey trying to sell out our reluctant hero, 
in the play's strongest scene. But Reddin's plot grows numbing and the second 
act seems to run forever. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6562 1/2 Santa Monica Blvd., tonight through Sunday, 8 p.m. Tickets: $12; 
(213) 462-9720. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'At Ground Level' 
</P>
<P>
The story of a spirited family in Costa Rica breaking through barriers of 
poverty and illiteracy, "At Ground Level (Home Sweet Home in Costa Rica)" is 
advocacy theater. But it's interesting for the historic and contemporary light 
it sheds on Central America. 
</P>
<P>
A grueling first act grinds the production down, but the thematic trajectory of 
the second act redeems much of the play at the Richmond Shepard. The play's 
85-year-old Costa Rican playwright, Luisa Gonzalez, dramatizes her own 
real-life story as a young, naive woman radicalized while living in a San Jose 
slum in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
This KPFK-sponsored first English language production (translated by Regina 
Pustan) features a rousing performance by BJ Theus as an ignorant shoemaker 
uncle who teaches himself to read and becomes a Leninist. Kate Romero delivers 
a modulated performance as his young niece, galvanized into fury when she loses 
a teaching job for joining a demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
Director Patric Z's seven-member cast is uneven (the mother wailing over an 
ironing board is never convincing), and the show could use more Latino actors. 
Quicker acceleration also would help. But the family's grit is enviable, and 
Kathy Crawford's spitfire prostitute enlivens the action. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6476 Santa Monica Blvd., tonight and Saturday, 8 p.m., ends Sunday, 7 p.m. 
Tickets: $10; (213) 452-3950. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Purloined Sterling' 
</P>
<P>
The re-creation of a 1940s radio mystery drama is the singular beguiling 
element in Anita Merzell's spoof, "The Case of the Purloined Sterling," at 
Actors Alley Too. 
</P>
<P>
The radio program's sound effects, with droll Mark Chaet unfurling cheese 
graters, garlic pressers and the like, is rich stuff. Playwright/director Anita 
Merzell, doubling as a radio actress playing hard-boiled detective Shayna 
Goldberg, is also fun -- for awhile. 
</P>
<P>
But this show stays on the air way past its time. You tire of the convoluted 
radio plot read into mikes by the actors (including Dana Kelly and the overripe 
Gene Marks), because there's no reason to listen to it. The premise is cleverly 
executed, but there's no characterization or plot development outside the 
deliberately dumb show within the show. 
</P>
<P>
Though the production can't sustain two acts, Chaet is terrific. And the creamy 
'40s-styled radio vocalist (the delicious Lari Tucker) is almost worth the 
admission. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4334 Van Nuys Blvd., Sherman Oaks, reopening Jan. 8 and running Mondays 
through Wednesdays, through Jan. 24. Free; donations. (818) 986-2278. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Attraction Fatal' 
</P>
<P>
L.A. theater veterans Nick and Edna Stewart are a testament to endurance. They 
opened their Ebony Showcase in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
The Stewarts don't produce much anymore, and maybe they should. The rental 
production in the Ebony Showcase Annex, writer-director Jerry Jones' 
"Attraction Fatal," about a murdered rock star, is inept, to put it softly. 
</P>
<P>
The show lurches between being a courtroom drama and a lounge act. The murder 
plot stops for singer Harold Burr and comic Cliff Howard to perform their acts. 
Talented as they are, their work belongs in a variety show. 
</P>
<P>
The comedy-drama, though, has its share of smiles and laughs whenever the 
zaftig and adventurous Vay Gainer takes the witness stand. The 13-member cast 
deserves better. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4708 Washington Blvd., Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 p.m. 
indefinitely. Tickets: $15-$17.50; (213) 936-1107.

KID BEAT: 'THE STRIKE BEFORE CHRISTMAS' PLAYS UNEVENLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
Underpaid and unappreciated, cranky elves refuse to make any more toys in " 
'Twas the Strike Before Christmas," a slight Los Angeles Children's Theatre 
effort at Los Angeles City College. 
</P>
<P>
Santa is shrewd. He doesn't raise wages, instead he promises a wacky fairy her 
wings if she can infuse the elves with holiday spirit and make them want to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Ruben Garfias, the elves -- Hideaki Imai, Laura Seasongood, Paulene 
Smith and Archie Tobias -- tumble, clown and mug with obvious relish, while 
quirky Pamela Tretter's Star is a rough and tough Christmas fairy. 
</P>
<P>
Bits of Clement C. Moore's classic poem "Twas the Night Before Christmas" are 
incorporated into the show, the audience joins in a caroling sing-along and 
Santa Claus (Walter Harrison) makes an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
But the play is uneven. Loosely written by Patricia Gaul and Deanna McKinstry 
for very young children, it hangs together and amuses primarily due to the 
good-humored energy of its cast of adults. 
</P>
<P>
The staging is disappointing. It has an unfinished, even messy look, surprising 
since the company did the play several times last year. The toy shop has little 
visual interest, the props are mundane and when snow "falls," it's thrown in 
clumsy fistfuls from behind the set. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Children's Theatre was formed in 1988 to provide "professional 
quality theater" for mainstream and economically or physically disadvantaged 
young audiences. It has provided theater to those groups, but quality, and 
proof of inspiring artistic vision are still in question. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge the company needs may come in the spring when it mounts Doris 
Baizley's sensitive, message drama "Guns." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Camino Theatre, 855 N. Vermont Ave., Saturday at 10 a.m.; Sunday at 1 
and 3:30 p.m.; Monday through next Friday at 7 p.m. and Dec. 23 at 10 a.m., 1 
and 3:30 p.m. Tickets, $6.50-$9.50; (213) 469-6663.

<P>
'Phantom Tollbooth' at L.A. Valley College 
</P>
<P>
Poor little Milo. Just about everything bores him, especially school and books. 
What's the use of learning anyway? 
</P>
<P>
In Norton Juster's classic children's novel "The Phantom Tollbooth," a magical 
journey fires Milo's thirst for knowledge. Little Broadway Productions' staging 
of Susan Nanus' adaptation of the novel at L.A. Valley College is respectful 
but uneven. 
</P>
<P>
A mysterious turnstile tollbooth takes Milo (Rich Knighton) to the Lands Beyond 
-- places such as Dictionopolis, the Doldrums, the Mountains of Ignorance and 
the Foothills of Confusion. 
</P>
<P>
He's given a mission -- rescue the princesses Rhyme and Reason (Roxann Richards 
and Melissa Malone) and restore harmony to the kingdoms of words and numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Milo is aided by Tock the Watch Dog (Sharon Ostreicher) and the Humbug (Mage 
White) and meets along the way Dr. Kakofonous A. Dischord (Phil Ward), the 
Demon of Insincerity, the wicked but repentant Which and a host of other 
eccentric characters. 
</P>
<P>
The cast is not entirely up to the demands of Juster's masterful wordplay -- 
subtleties are lost in rushed lines and blurred articulation. Transitional 
scenes are often static as well. Director Marilyn Weitz seems to have taken a 
feast-or-famine approach -- some scenes are full of visual and physical 
interest; others come up empty. (Jerry W. Abbitt did the cartoonish sets.) 
</P>
<P>
But Weitz also designed the bright, whimsical costumes and she excels with 
padded capes and fantastic hats. The Dodecahedron's head with 12 faces is 
delightful. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5800 Fulton Ave. in Van Nuys on Thursday at 11 a.m. and 1:15 p.m. and next 
Friday at 11 a.m. (other Valley College performances are sold out). Also at 
UCLA's Wadsworth Theater Jan. 11 at 12:15 p.m. Under age 4 not admitted. 
Tickets, $6; (818) 990-3232.

Billy Crystal's fans can have a Crystal ball at the video store this weekend. 
Not only does Mr. "You Look Marvelous" star in the 1989 hit romantic comedy 
"When Harry Met Sally . . . ," but he also appears in "Breaking Up Is Hard to 
Do," a 1979 TV drama about four divorced men that has belatedly reached video 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner (who last worked with Crystal 
in "The Princess Bride"), "When Harry Met Sally . . ." (Nelson, $89.98, R) 
teams Crystal with Meg Ryan in a dryly comic, Woody Allen-influenced 
examination of friendship vs. romance. Also starring Carrie Fisher and Bruno 
Kirby, the film surprised many industry observers by earning more than $80 
million at the box office. It should meet with similar success as a cassette. 
</P>
<P>
"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do" (Vidmark, $89.95), while not a comedy and "just" an 
old TV movie, may be a satisfactory rental for Crystal's fans, too -- 
especially those who have been recently divorced. It's overly long at 150 
minutes, but a sensitive and intelligent look at how hard the breaking up can 
be -- from four men's perspectives. Crystal co-stars with Robert Conrad, Ted 
Bessell, Jeff Conaway, Bonnie Franklin, Tony Musante and David Ogden Stiers. 
</P>
<P>
"Dirty Dancing" star Patrick Swayze's fans didn't respond with much enthusiasm 
to his last film, "Road House," but maybe the violent 1989 drama about a bar 
bouncer will bounce back on video (MGM/UA, $89.98, R). 
</P>
<P>
Want to own all 883 commercial-less minutes of the ABC series "The Winds of 
War," starring Robert Mitchum, Ali MacGraw and many others? It'll cost you 
$139.95 for the whole set of Paramount cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
The great Roman Polanski-Robert Towne collaboration "Chinatown," starring Jack 
Nicholson has been repriced by Paramount to $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
"Shag: The Movie" (HBO, $89.99, PG) is a lighthearted bit of comic nostalgia 
about three young women's eventful 1963 Memorial Day weekend at Myrtle Beach. 
The bright young cast includes Phoebe Cates, Bridget Fonda, Annabeth Gish, Page 
Hannah and Scott Coffey. TERRY ATKINSON

CD CORNER: ROULETTE STARS TOP RHINO'S LATEST OFFERINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are some weeks when it seems appropriate to call this column the Rhino 
Records Corner, because the Santa Monica-based label continues to come up with 
so many impressive CD reissues from the early days of rock. 
</P>
<P>
The latest examples are the first four titles in a series of packages that are 
being released in connection with Rhino's acquisition of the North American 
rights to the catalogues of Roulette Records and associated labels. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the "best of" collections are by prized R&amp;B groups that got their 
starts in the '50s: Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers and Little Anthony &amp; 
the Imperials. 
</P>
<P>
Lymon was just 13 when he recorded "Why Do Fools Fall in Love," one of the most 
celebrated hits from rock's first decade. One of the great young voices of 
early R&amp;B and a big influence on Michael Jackson, Lymon went through a 
series of personal problems in the '60s and died of an apparent drug overdose 
in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Little Anthony -- Anthony Gourdine -- was not as noteworthy a stylist as Lymon, 
but he was responsible for some memorable hits, including "Tears on My Pillow," 
"Goin' Out of My Head" and "Hurt So Bad." 
</P>
<P>
The two other Rhino releases center on '60s rock groups: Tommy James &amp; the 
Shondells and Mitch Ryder &amp; the Detroit Wheels. James also recorded his 
first hit when was 13: "Hanky Panky." Among his other hits were "I Think We're 
Alone Now" and "Crimson and Clover." After going on his own, James returned to 
the Top 10 with "Draggin' the Line," which is also included in the Rhino album. 
</P>
<P>
Next to Lymon and James, Ryder (real name: William Levise) was a slow starter. 
He was 20 when he broke into the national charts with the high-energy "Jenny 
Take a Ride." The group's other Top 10 hits included the "Devil With a Blue 
Dress On"/"Good Golly Miss Molly" medley that Bruce Springsteen has often 
saluted in concert. 
</P>
<P>
Like most Rhino collections, all four CD albums come with extensive liner notes 
and photos. Among the Roulette-related artists who will be featured in future 
anthologies: Jimmie Rodgers ("Honeycomb" and "Kisses Sweeter Than Wine"), 
Ronnie Hawkins (whose backing group once included some members of the Band), 
Joey Dee ("Peppermint Twist"), the Marcels ("Blue Moon"), the Cadillacs 
("Speedo") and the Cleftones ("Little Girl of Mine"). 
</P>
<P>
IN THE BUDGET BIN -- The latest four entries in Capitol Records' excellent 
"Collector's Series" (budget CDs featuring at least 20 tracks per album and 
handsome liner note/photo booklets) spotlight the Four Preps, the Five Keys 
(one of the first R&amp;B groups signed by a major label), Dean Martin and 
Wayne Newton. . . . Other budget collections in the stores: the Eagles' "Live," 
Al Green's "Call Me" and "Full of Fire," Joan Armatrading's "Walk Under 
Ladders," Squeeze's "Singles 45s and Under," Laura Nyro's "New York 
Tendaberry," Jefferson Airplane's "Crown of Creation," Buffalo Springfield's 
"Buffalo Springfield" plus Bette Midler's "Bette Midler" and her "Divine 
Madness" sound-track album.

IN REVERSAL, MILITARY SEEKS DRUG WAR ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS JEHL and MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than a year after struggling mightily to avoid it, the armed forces have 
now abruptly reversed course and begun scrambling to win a principal role in 
the nation's war on drugs -- seeing it as a lucrative haven at a time when 
their traditional mission is shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
Ambitious proposals that only recently would have been scorned as inappropriate 
have been pouring into the Pentagon and some already have been endorsed 
enthusiastically by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
The armed forces' 10 top field commanders have proposed a host of new anti-drug 
missions that range from launching satellites to spying on cocaine traffickers 
to interdicting heroin shipments at sea as they are smuggled out of Southeast 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
"With peace breaking out all over," one two-star general said in an interview, 
"it might give us something to do." 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic reversal reflects a calculated judgment by Pentagon leaders that 
getting a big piece of the drug war could help the military preserve its power 
as its postwar role as a counterforce to the Soviet bloc appears to be in 
decline, Administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the plans endorsed last month are a list of long-term, "Category Three" 
ventures that would require more money for manpower and new technology. 
</P>
<P>
If the plans are approved by the National Security Council and President Bush, 
the Pentagon officials believe the new tasks could provide the military with a 
renewed justification to demand funds for troops, ships and training missions 
now severely threatened by budget-cutters. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden turnabout has also prompted animosity and concern from the federal 
agencies now in the forefront of the anti-drug effort. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a 180-degree shift," one top official said. "From too little to too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
"They're the biggest kid on the playing field, and they want to punt, pass and 
kick," another official said. "We may decide in the end that we would all be 
better off if they just tried to be good blockers." 
</P>
<P>
The details of the new Pentagon proposals remain classified, and the critics 
said they could not discuss the elements that made them the most wary. But as 
an example of their concerns, two high-ranking anti-drug officials cited a new 
military task force formed last month to help in reconnaissance and drug 
interdiction along the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
The creation of that team, known as Joint Task Force-6, piqued international 
tensions when the Mexican government accused the United States of militarizing 
the Southwest border. And it has since stirred tensions among other anti-drug 
agencies over what they regard as the military's cavalier approach to a 
sensitive task. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to want to do the job all by themselves," said one official who has 
taken part in meetings designed to resolve the dispute. He said the Ft. Bliss, 
Tex.-based task force, commanded by Lt. Gen. George R. Stotser, had not sought 
to coordinate its operations with the El Paso Intelligence Center or other 
federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, the Administration's top anti-drug official, William J. 
Bennett, said he believed it was "terrific" that Cheney and the armed forces 
commanders had been so "eager to get involved." But he acknowledged that their 
aggressiveness had bruised some feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"You've sort of got the Defense Department going all around the place, saying: 
'What about this? What about there? What about here?' " said Bennett, the 
director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the agency heads said to me, 'These guys are great, but you know it's 
like having an 800-pound gorilla fall in love with you. You know, 'Roarrrr -- I 
like you a lot.' " 
</P>
<P>
"You've got this little operation somewhere and the (military) comes in and 
says: 'Hey, how'd ya like 5,000 men?' So we're sorting it out," Bennett said. 
"You've got to be careful." 
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary change in Pentagon anti-drug posture in the last nine months 
has almost entirely eclipsed the hands-off approach that Defense Secretaries 
Caspar W. Weinberger and Frank C. Carlucci doggedly maintained even in response 
to the pleas of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"Our military is not trained to read people their Miranda rights," Carlucci 
retorted in congressional testimony last year. "They're trained to shoot to 
kill." Soldiers are not trained as law enforcement officers and already had an 
essential job defending the nation's security, he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials attributed much of the turnabout to the influence last 
spring of Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, who was preparing to take over as 
the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They recognized the growing 
priority of the anti-drug effort to the new President and public, and 
accordingly began to draft new plans. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Cheney made the new thinking clear by declaring drugs a "direct 
threat to the sovereignty and security of our country." 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, lessening the 
military threat the Pentagon was geared up to meet, added even more impetus. 
</P>
<P>
Prior to the sudden prospect of dramatic cuts in the Pentagon budget, one 
source said, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were expected to treat anti-drug 
proposals from senior commanders critically. Amid the "shock" of a changing 
world, he said, the proposals "must have seemed a godsend." 
</P>
<P>
"Getting help from the military on drugs used to be like pulling teeth," said 
Lawrence J. Korb, a former assistant secretary of defense in the Ronald Reagan 
Administration. "Now everybody's looking around to say: 'Hey, how can we 
justify these forces?' And the answer they're coming up with is drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Air Force analysts have suggested the service might expand the use of its radar 
capability to monitor drug trafficking. In an outgrowth of that thinking, the 
service has proposed that the Airborne Warning and Control System, or AWACS, 
aircraft be dispatched on a series of flights to take place near Colombia in 
coming months, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The longer-term Air Force proposals would enlist high-resolution spy satellites 
to provide glimpses of shifting ground bases for drug traffickers, including 
drug processing laboratories hidden deep in jungles. They might also give a 
boost to systems such as the Joint Service Targeting and Reconnaissance System, 
a high-priced radar designed to plot Warsaw Pact troop movements that some 
believe could offer an unparalleled view of drug traffickers, one analyst said.

Navy budget planners have come up with an ingenious plan to resolve their own 
dilemma: how to operate its growing number of ships with a diminishing pot of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Their solution, proposed in October and expected to win final approval from the 
White House within a week, was to shift some Atlantic training operations to 
the Caribbean, where they could serve double duty by keeping watch on drug 
trafficking from international waters off Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy move, which could station as many as 90 aircraft and 12 ships in the 
region, would ensure a continued source of training funds -- and with them, 
steaming hours -- for the Atlantic Command, even as the budget dips in the 
coming years. 
</P>
<P>
One retired Navy officer likened the Navy's new-found enthusiasm for the drug 
mission to the service's no-holds-barred bid to get its own nuclear weapons in 
the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to get our share of the nuclear mission no matter what the 
cost," said retired Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll, deputy director of the 
Washington-based Center for Defense Information. "Now drug interdiction is at 
least a raft to keep you afloat." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Congress first urged the Pentagon to assume a major role in the war on drugs in 
1987, but the armed services resisted the call on grounds that it would detract 
from their war-preparedness roles. A turnabout began in September, when new 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney identified drug-fighting as a top-priority 
military mission. The change has accelerated with the events in Eastern Europe.

<P>
Sue Lobrano had expected to face a tough bunch of customers when she set out 
for a Rotary Club luncheon in the rural Mississippi Delta to drum up support 
for the International Ballet Competition. 
</P>
<P>
Although the competition, known as the "Olympics of Dance," is a world-class 
event and Jackson is the only city outside Europe honored as one of the four 
rotating host communities, Lobrano feared such distinctions would not mean much 
to the cotton planting and catfish farming Delta Rotarians. 
</P>
<P>
But right after she had made her pitch, one of the Rotarians stood up and won 
his colleagues to her cause. He had attended the event out of curiosity while 
in Jackson on business, and then went back for a second and third night. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something taking place in this state that I hadn't known about, but 
people from all over the world were coming to," Lobrano recalled him saying. 
"Gentlemen, this is something that should be supported." 
</P>
<P>
Southerners have long yearned to recapture their glory days before the Civil 
War, when cities such as Richmond, Va., Charleston, S.C., and New Orleans were 
thriving centers of culture and refinement, with opera houses, theaters, 
concert halls and art galleries rivaling many of those in the North. 
</P>
<P>
Yet not until recent decades -- with the new-found prosperity created by the 
Sun Belt economic boom and the dramatic changes in the intellectual and social 
climate brought about by the civil rights movement -- have they been able to 
make much headway in fulfilling that dream. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as Lobrano's story illustrates, the South is a far cry from the cultural 
wasteland that journalist and social critic H. L. Mencken once characterized as 
the "Sahara of the Bozart," playing on the words "bozo" and "beaux arts." Just 
as the region has emerged as a force to be reckoned with on the nation's 
economic and political landscape, so it has begun to make its mark on the 
country's cultural scene. 
</P>
<P>
Charleston, the cultural pacesetter in antebellum Dixie, has gained new fame as 
home of the Spoleto Festival USA -- the so-called "Gucci of arts festivals." 
Atlanta, a city better known for its love of bucks than of Beethoven and Bach, 
boasts a symphony orchestra that is among the tops in the nation and is winner 
of almost a dozen Grammys for classical music. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery, Alabama's capital, is the site of a nationally acclaimed 
Shakespeare festival headquartered in a palatial $21.5-million theater complex. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, one measure of the South's reintegration into American society at large 
has been the growth of arts organizations in the region that compare favorably 
in size, scope and mission to their counterparts up north. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how far this reflowering of the South's artistic and cultural 
life will go and what its ultimate contribution to the nation may be. Its 
financial roots are still fragile: The Sun Belt economic boom has slowed, and 
arts organizations in the South are in a scramble with other charitable causes 
for increasingly scarce funding. 
</P>
<P>
"The arts community in the South is at a really important crossroads," said 
Adrian King, executive director of the Atlanta-based Southern Arts Federation. 
"The situation is not unlike that in any major industry that has grown and 
developed but finds that its beginning stimulus has greatly changed." 
</P>
<P>
But even being known as a major industry is a triumph for Southern arts. 
</P>
<P>
Houston, for example, was born a roughneck and long eschewed refined 
diversions. Today, it is one of the few cities in the country that can boast of 
nationally recognized companies in opera, ballet, symphony and theater. 
</P>
<P>
"During the 1960s and 1970s, major corporations moved to Houston from places 
like Chicago and New York, where they expect to have cultural activities" said 
Mary Anne Piacentini, executive director of the Cultural Arts Council of 
Houston. "Business leaders made a conscious decision to turn around the image 
of Houston. . . ." Houstonians also felt they had something to prove. 
"Houstonians knew they were cowboys," said Eugene Loveland, a retired oil 
company executive and former chairman of Houston's Corporate Arts Council. 
</P>
<P>
Even the recent oil bust has not set back Houston's ambitions. Two years ago 
the $72-million Wortham Theater Center opened. It is the only major American 
opera house to be constructed since the Kennedy Center in Washington in 1971, 
and is the permanent home of the Houston Grand Opera and Houston Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
"Surprisingly, the economic bust helped in some ways because it helped people 
realize that the arts are a big plus for Houston," Piacentini said. 
</P>
<P>
Durham, part of North Carolina's affluent, high-tech "Research Triangle," is 
emerging as a major preview center for Broadway-bound plays -- a role once 
played by cities such as Boston, New Haven, Conn., Philadelphia, Washington and 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
A 3-year-old project at Duke University called the Duke Drama Pre-Broadway 
Series has turned the campus into a testing ground. Two current Broadway 
productions that previewed at Duke are the revival of Somerset Maugham's "The 
Circle," starring Rex Harrison, Glynis Johns and Stewart Granger, and Tom 
Stoppard's newest play, "Artist Descending a Staircase." 
</P>
<P>
Others have included "Metamorphosis," starring Mikhail Baryshnikov in Steven 
Berkoff's adaptation of the Franz Kafka classic; Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's 
Journey into Night," starring Jack Lemmon, and Lee Blessing's "A Walk in the 
Woods," starring Sam Waterson and Robert Prosky. 
</P>
<P>
The series is the brainchild of Broadway producer Emanuel Azenberg, winner of 
29 Tony awards for such shows as "Biloxi Blues" and "Children of a Lesser God." 
Azenberg first visited the campus when his daughter was a student there. Six 
years ago, he became a drama professor -- commuting from New York 22 weeks a 
year -- and proposed the idea of the Broadway preview project to the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
David Ball, Duke's director of drama, said a play can be produced at Durham for 
much less than in many Northeast cities. At the same time, the audience is "not 
a bunch of hicks," he said. "This area has the highest concentration of Ph.Ds 
and MAs in the country. So the artists get a fairly good gauge." 
</P>
<P>
The arts rebound is even penetrating the rural South. In the south Georgia 
community of Tifton, for example, the Arts Experiment Station headquartered at 
Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College has worked with local arts councils in a 
five-county region to develop a lively and varied cultural scene. 
</P>
<P>
Created in 1976 with the help of a $25,000 grant from the National Endowment 
for the Arts, the station last year coordinated more than 150 activities and 
events that served 58,000 people -- almost 40% of the total population in the 
five counties -- at a total cost of about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
The way up was not easy. "When we first began programming, our arts exhibits 
had to be shown in bank lobbies, in automobile showrooms and, in one case, in 
an appliance shop," said Syd Blackmarr, executive director of the station, 
whose name was designed to be reminiscent of the agricultural experiment 
stations that helped develop the South's farm life. 
</P>
<P>
"The Atlanta Ballet had to perform in unair-conditioned gyms in 90-degree heat 
in summer, and the auditorium at Abraham Baldwin was the only facility we had 
that could be used as a theater." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, several newly constructed or renovated facilities in the various 
counties have been provided for the arts, including an 850-seat theater, a 
2,000-seat auditorium in a civic center and space for visual exhibits at four 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
The South arts revival is also boosting black culture in a way that many blacks 
compare to the role Harlem and Washington played in previous decades. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for instance, Atlanta inaugurated a National Black Arts Festival 
that attracted more than 500,000 people. More than 120 activities and events 
were held over 10 days in eight artistic disciplines, including theater, dance, 
film and folk arts. Among the cultural offerings were the world premieres of 
playwright Charles Fuller's "Sally" and George Faison's "The Apollo . . . It 
Was Just Like Magic." 
</P>
<P>
This year, a similar biennial festival devoted to black theater was launched in 
Winston-Salem, under the impetus of the North Carolina Black Repertory Company. 
The seven-day event provided an unprecedented showcase for black theater 
groups, ranging from New York's Negro Ensemble Company to San Francisco's 
African-American Drama Company to Atlanta's Jomandi Productions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a native New Yorker, but I find the South affords us many more 
possibilities and opportunities than the North," said Thomas Jones III, Jomandi 
Productions' co-founder and artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
Like many major arts organizations elsewhere in the nation, however, those 
below the Mason-Dixon Line often are staggering under heavy budget deficits 
that pose a constant threat to their survival. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of the 10 major symphonies and almost half of the leading theater 
companies in the region operated in the red this past season. 
</P>
<P>
Several ballet troupes are also in dire financial straits. The 60-year-old 
Atlanta Ballet, which bills itself as the oldest performing ballet company in 
the nation, was forced this year to do away with its 61-member orchestra as 
part of its effort to erase $1.6 million in red ink. 
</P>
<P>
Only eight of the 25 opera companies in the South operated with a surplus in 
the most recent year for which figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
Last year when the Nashville Symphony Orchestra declared bankruptcy and shut 
down in the face of a projected $700,000 deficit, the collapse sent shock waves 
through "Music City USA," one of the most economically competitive communities 
in the South. 
</P>
<P>
"Corporate interest in Nashville stopped dead when the symphony went out of 
business," said Anne Jordan, the symphony's former marketing director. 
"Companies who were interested in moving here or in expanding their facilities 
here started having second thoughts about what kind of community Nashville was 
if it couldn't support a symphony." 
</P>
<P>
That prospect helped propel state and city governments, along with the business 
community and a wide array of private individuals, to raise more than $1.5 
million to revive the 85-member ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
Several country music stars then lent a hand, performing for reduced fees at 
the symphony's pops and cabaret concerts. One of them, Michael Martin Murphey, 
a country-pop singer whose hits have included "Wildfire" and "Geronimo's 
Cadillac," said that although symphonies often suffer from a "stuffed-shirt 
image . . . it would be a tragedy if we lost that classical heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Martha Ingram, a Nashville businesswoman who heads the symphony's board, said 
that the company is not totally out of the woods yet. "What we need -- and what 
all arts groups need -- is a reliable economic base. You go crazy when you make 
up budgets on certain assumptions, like how much corporate giving you'll get, 
and those assumptions don't hold up." 
</P>
<P>
Her complaint is common among arts organizations in the South. 
</P>
<P>
In North Carolina, for example, backers of a new $38-million performing arts 
center in Charlotte that is slated to open in 1992 say that the state 
Legislature promised to pay $15 million of the costs but still owes $3.5 
million on its pledge. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any question, whether you're talking about local, state 
or national governments, arts are not among the top priorities," said Betty 
Chafin Rash, a Charlotte businesswoman and arts center board member. 
</P>
<P>
Legislatures in the 11 states of the Old Confederacy are now appropriating a 
total of more than $48 million to fund the arts -- almost three times what they 
were only five years ago. But arts leaders in the region contend that that 
amount is not nearly enough to keep up with rising costs, program development 
plans and the increasing number of arts organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The total also is deceiving, they note. Florida alone accounts for almost half 
the amount -- $21 million. 
</P>
<P>
Still, growth in the arts in the South is such that it is pushing up against 
available staging space in many of the region's big cities. 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, for example, the Atlanta Opera's plans to expand its season and 
repertoire have been stuck because of the lack of a facility with a seating 
capacity of between 2,000 and 2,500 that would be available on a year-round 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
At present, the opera is confined to a brief summer season at the 874-seat 
Alliance Theater just north of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The only other facilities that could be used -- the Atlanta Civic Center and 
the downtown Fox Theater, each of which seats 4,600 people -- would be too big 
for the opera to fill "even if I staged the second coming of Christ with the 
original cast," said William Fred Scott, the opera's artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
"Atlanta could be a truly distinguished cultural hub," said Helen C. Smith, an 
arts writer for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. "But lack of appropriate 
facilities and lack of dollars are holding it back." 
</P>
<P>
But not all the problems of arts organizations in the South can be blamed on 
outside factors. The organizations themselves do not have the tradition and 
depth of their Northern counterparts, and therefore can suffer from poor 
management, failure to develop broader audience support and lack of 
professionalized fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen some of these organizations spend $50,000 to raise $10,000 at a big 
lavish party," said an observer of Mississippi's cultural scene. 
</P>
<P>
Opera in Jackson took a giant step backward this year when the board of the 
Mississippi Opera fired the company's general manager and artistic director, 
Franklin Choset, who had brought in guest artists with international 
reputations and staged dazzling productions of "Aida," "Tosca" and "Salome." 
</P>
<P>
Choset, a New Yorker, rubbed some board members and wealthy patrons the wrong 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Choset had plenty of defenders. "He's not rude," one supporter said in a letter 
to the local newspaper, "he is just from New York." But no amount of pleading 
on Choset's behalf availed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important to have the social graces in addition to being talented," 
said H. Muller Addkinson, a prominent Jackson businessman who was the opera 
board's chairman at the time of Choset's discharge. 
</P>
<P>
No replacement has been hired, however, and for the first time in years, the 
opera season opened this fall without a full production. "They're back to where 
they were 15 years ago," complained one opera lover. 
</P>
<P>
Times researchers Edith Stanley in Atlanta, Lianne Hart in Houston and Lisa 
Romaine in New York contributed to this story.

STATE MOVES TO SPEED SWITCH TO CLEANER CARS; 
</P>
<P>
SMOG: THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD ENDORSES A PLAN TO WEAN DRIVERS FROM 
GASOLINE-POWERED VEHICLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major effort to accelerate the shift to cars powered by cleaner fuels, the 
state Air Resources Board on Thursday endorsed the broad outlines of a plan to 
wean California motorists of conventional gasoline-powered cars by as early as 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed requirements, which go far beyond the already tough 1994 tailpipe 
emission limits adopted last June for conventional gasoline-powered cars, would 
have major implications for auto makers and oil companies, as well as for 
consumers. The new regulations almost certainly would require use of 
alternative fuels such as methanol, compressed natural gas and electricity. New 
emission control technologies would also be required. 
</P>
<P>
The requirements, if approved by the board next September, would set the course 
of California's vehicle emissions controls into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
Without a new generation of motor vehicles, the board said that the four-county 
South Coast Air Basin will not be able to achieve its 20-year goal of meeting 
federal clean air standards. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District earlier this year adopted a 
sweeping clean-air strategy that touches nearly all aspects of Southern 
Californians' lives, from driving habits to back-yard barbecuing. 
</P>
<P>
James M. Lents, AQMD executive officer, applauded the board's 7-0 vote 
directing its staff to proceed with the clean-fuel proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"We're now more than ever allies in the war on smog," Lents said. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1997, one out of every four cars sold in the state would have to 
emit 70% less of smog-forming hydrocarbons than required by the 1994 standard, 
under the ARB staff proposal. By 1998, half of all cars sold would be required 
to meet the tougher standard. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, there would be two tailpipe standards -- one for conventional 
gasoline cars based on the 1994 standard, and another for so-called 
"low-emission cars," which the state would require to be sold in California. 
</P>
<P>
The standard for low-emission cars limits hydrocarbon emissions to 0.075 grams 
per mile. The standard for conventional gasoline-powered vehicles limits 
emissions to 0.25 grams per mile. Federal standards now set hydrocarbon limits 
at 0.41 grams per mile. 
</P>
<P>
As time passed, the market share of low-emission cars would grow from less than 
10% in 1994 to 100% of new cars sold in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
By 2010, the ARB staff estimated that two-thirds of gasoline use in California 
would be displaced by the cleaner fuels. Heavy-duty trucks and off-road 
vehicles, among others, would continue to use conventional gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we've started to wean people away from gasoline and 
cars as we know them," Air Resources Board spokesman Bill Sessa said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Added board executive officer James Boyd: "This is a very, very significant 
milestone along the path to clean air." 
</P>
<P>
Oil companies would be required to sell alternative fuels at their service 
stations as a condition for continuing to sell gasoline in the state. 
Automobile makers would be required to make the lower-emission vehicles in 
order to meet the tougher standard. 
</P>
<P>
Auto makers and the oil industry two months ago launched a joint research and 
testing program looking at advanced vehicles and fuels. On Thursday, industry 
representatives cautioned that the ARB staff's proposed timetable was 
unrealistically fast and may not be technologically feasible. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Calhoun, assistant director for automotive emissions controls at General 
Motors, said: "GM does not believe that the standards . . . are feasible in the 
time frame proposed." 
</P>
<P>
He added that trying to meet the standards would result in significant cost 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Western States Petroleum Assn. and Arco both applauded the ARB's 
general strategy, although they expressed concern about details. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if it could be done, Douglas Henderson, executive director of the 
association, said: "We think so. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a watershed event. The impacts on our industry are huge and will 
determine all the work done by petroleum producers and refiners for years," 
Henderson said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson predicted that whatever California does will have national and even 
global impact. He noted that northeastern states have already copied 
California's existing tailpipe emission standards rather than settle for weaker 
federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Townsend, manager of operations support for Arco Products Co., said the ARB 
staff's general approach was "conceptually sound and holds promise for 
success." But he urged the board to remember that a complex program "depends 
critically upon its details for the promise to become reality." 
</P>
<P>
As envisioned by the staff, there would be three categories of progressively 
cleaner cars -- transitional low-emission vehicles, low-emission vehicles and 
ultra-low-emission vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
But even the transitional low-emission vehicles would spew out only half as 
much smog-forming hydrocarbons as the the cleanest new cars on the road in 
1994. The low-emission vehicles would be 40% cleaner still, and the 
ultra-low-emission vehicles would cut hydrocarbon emissions half-again as much 
as the second category. 
</P>
<P>
According to the ARB, for the first generation of cleaner cars -- transitional 
low-emission vehicles -- significant modifications to current engine design and 
control technologies would not be required. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the staff noted that the Nissan Sentra already meets the hydrocarbon 
standard that takes effect in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
But the second generation of low-emission vehicles, or LEVs, would require 
advances in pollution-control technologies. Gasoline engines might be able to 
comply with the standard if, for example, electrically heated catalytic 
converters work as the staff said early tests show. 
</P>
<P>
But substitute fuels, such as methanol and compressed natural gas, could meet 
the standard without the electrically heated catalytic converters. 
</P>
<P>
The third generation of "ultra-low-emission vehicles" would most likely have to 
be powered by electricity, although the staff as a matter of policy has not 
ruled out the use of any fuel so long as it can meet the tough standards. 
</P>
<P>
Under a proposed timetable, the first generation cars would have to be 
available as soon as 1994. Between then and 1996, up to 10% of all cars sold in 
the state would have to be a transitional low-emission vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1997, one out of every four cars sold in the state would have to 
be a second generation or low-emission vehicles. The following year, half of 
all cars sold would have to be a low-emission vehicle. The LEVs' market share 
would rise to 98% in the year 2000. After that, the share would gradually 
diminish as the third generation vehicle took up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very tough challenge," ARB Chairwoman Jananne Sharpless said. She 
noted that three U.S. automobile manufacturers and 14 oil companies have 
embarked on a joint research and development program. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to build on what we see going on with your industry. This is a 
test to see if we can integrate clean fuel and automotive technology," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in its push to clean up the South Coast Basin, the AQMD next year 
will consider a rule requiring operators of fleets of more than 15 vehicles to 
begin purchasing alternative, cleaner-fueled vehicles. By the year 2000, the 
AQMD said half of all vehicles in such fleets should run on cleaner fuels. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD's goal is that by the year 2000, 40% of all cars, 70% of all trucks 
and 100% of buses must run on cleaner fuels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The four-county South Coast Air Basin has the worst air quality in the nation. 
Earlier this year, the regional South Coast Air Quality Management District 
adopted a 20-year plan to bring Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties into compliance with federal clean air standards. The AQMD 
has authority over stationary sources of pollution, such as factories. Working 
with the AQMD has been the state Air Resources Board, which has jurisdiction 
over motor vehicle emissions. Over the years, the ARB has imposed increasingly 
strict limits on tailpipe emissions. It has required oil companies to remove 
lead from gasoline, required auto makers to install catalytic converters and 
on-board diagnostic computers to monitor emissions. But those steps have 
involved making existing, conventionally powered gasoline vehicles cleaner.

L.A. SETTLES SUIT ON BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The city of Los Angeles on Thursday announced settlement of a $100-million 
lawsuit filed by the state over sewage spills at the Hyperion treatment plant, 
bringing an end to a series of legal actions and setting in motion drastic new 
efforts to reverse environmental damage to Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the settlement, the state will drop its suit and the city will 
invest more than $100 million in improvements to its aging sewage facilities, 
in new water conservation and reclamation programs and in museum exhibits aimed 
at heightening public awareness of the causes of bay pollution and its possible 
remedies. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of having $100 million in fines go to the state treasury . . . it's 
going into improving our sewage system," said John Stodder, an environmental 
affairs aide to Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the way controversies between two government agencies should be 
handled," Bradley said at a press conference Thursday. "Instead of fighting it 
out in the courts, we solved it at the bargaining table." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley called the settlement -- unanimously approved by the City Council in a 
closed-door session Tuesday -- a "historic agreement" and said Los Angeles is 
on the "cutting edge" of dealing with sewage problems. Virtually all of the 
costs will be borne by the city's existing sewage surcharge tax imposed on all 
homeowners and commercial landlords, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
City and state officials and environmental activists said the programs 
established in the agreement will help return the bay to a condition not seen 
for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental experts agreed that the city has come a long way since 1987, when 
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp filed the suit against the city, seeking 
penalties of up to $20 a gallon for two major spills that dumped a total of 
more than 5.4 million gallons of raw sewage into the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1987 spills, the city was also forced to sign a consent decree with 
the Environmental Protection Agency, under which it agreed to improve the 
quality of the discharge from the Hyperion sewage treatment plant by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Green, president of Heal the Bay, an environmental group, said the city 
"has taken the initiative and run with it" in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
But the agreement signed this week, Green said, is a "safeguard." She noted 
that should administrations or attitudes change at City Hall, they will still 
be held accountable" for continued improvements to the sewage infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
Green said that some provisions in the agreement -- such as programs to clean 
up Ballona Creek and halt polluted discharges from the Thorton Avenue drain 
pipe in Venice -- "are more than we would have had the nerve to ask for." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke Drane, chairman of the state's Regional Water Quality Control Board, 
said that the city would have been required to do some of the promised work 
under existing state and federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's a number of things we got them to do that they wouldn't have to do 
otherwise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Drane estimated -- and city officials concurred -- that at least $80 million 
will be spent on these additional programs. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the city has established a water reclamation office, 
charged with finding ways to capture and reuse waste water. 
</P>
<P>
The city also agreed to enter a voluntary EPA program next year in which it 
will help write new regulations for controlling storm water runoff, which 
carries road oil, pesticides and other pollutants into the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Other programs under the agreement include a proposed $4-million "inflatable 
dam" to be installed in Ballona Creek to trap runoff water for treatment before 
it flows into the bay and a $7-million water treatment plant at the Los Angeles 
Zoo, where animal droppings are now routinely washed into the city's storm 
drains. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the work specified in the agreement involves mechanical improvements to 
the city's sewage system. Some of it, such as electrical power upgrading at 
Hyperion, have already been completed. It was the electrical failure of pumps 
at Hyperion that led to the 1987 spills. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the city must replace the pumping plant at Ballona Creek 
and upgrade as many as 27 generators at 19 pumping stations by 1993 and upgrade 
the control system at the Venice pumping plant by 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Equally important are growth control measures. The agreement calls on the city 
to adopt a new "sewer allocation ordinance," which uses the issuance of 
building permits as a means of controlling additional sewage flows to the 
Hyperion plant. 
</P>
<P>
The city is also required to complete programs under its 1988 water 
conservation ordinance, which requires "low-flow" water fixtures. New homes and 
commercial buildings have had to install such fixtures for the past year. 
Starting in March, the city will begin handing out do-it-yourself kits 
door-to-door for installation in all existing homes. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to teach the need for continued vigilance, the city agreed to 
establish and maintain for five years an exhibit on bay pollution at the Museum 
of Science and Industry.

QUAKE-DEVASTATED SANTA CRUZ MERCHANTS, PUBLIC PULL TOGETHER 
</P>

SANTA CRUZ 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Near the devastated downtown, a thriving business district before the 
earthquake, the Phoenix Pavilions rose out of the rubble to salvage the holiday 
shopping season for dozens of merchants. 
</P>
<P>
The pavilions are not much to look at, just a collection of large, gray 
tent-like structures dotting a strip of parking lots. But they have played a 
critical role in the renaissance of downtown Santa Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 businesses, whose buildings were demolished or condemned, have been 
able to stay downtown in the pavilions rather than filing for bankruptcy or 
moving to outlying malls or nearby cities. 
</P>
<P>
After all the grim events that folowed the 7.1-magnitude earthquake on Oct. 17, 
the Phoenix Pavilions, named after the mythological bird that burned to death 
and rose again from its ashes, have provided Santa Cruz with some badly needed 
good news. Since the pavilions opened the day after Thanksgiving, its shops 
have been packed, with many stores having record holiday season sales. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors from throughout Northern California have taken Christmas shopping 
trips to Santa Cruz to support local merchants. And many residents have vowed 
to do all their shopping in the pavilions instead of in malls. 
</P>
<P>
"The day after Thanksgiving we had our biggest day since we opened 23 years ago 
. . . and business has stayed great since then," said Neal Coonerty, owner of 
Bookshop Santa Cruz. "We really feel this will enable us to survive." 
</P>
<P>
Before the earthquake, the open-air, seven-block Pacific Garden Mall was the 
focal point of downtown. With its red-tiled walkways, flower beds and 
turn-of-the-century buildings, the shopping district gave Santa Cruz's downtown 
a distinct identity. 
</P>
<P>
But the quake destroyed 20% of the 125 mall buildings, many of them historic, 
seriously damaged numerous others and killed three people. Several chain stores 
on the mall immediately abandoned Santa Cruz and relocated to other cities. A 
number of local businesses moved to nearby Capitola. 
</P>
<P>
City officials worried that by the time the mall was finally rebuilt, they 
would be unable to lure shoppers back to Santa Cruz. And the landmark mall, 
they feared, would eventually lose most of its business to suburban shopping 
centers. A merchants' association and city officials agreed to erect the 
pavilions, lease them out for up to 18 months, until much of the mall is 
rebuilt, and keep shoppers and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"If we couldn't keep our downtown businesses, Santa Cruz would end up as a 
ghost town," said Susan Groff, a member of the Downtown Commission and owner of 
a luggage store that moved to the pavilions. "The mall is our city's tax base 
and where a lot of our residents work. . . . Take it away and our city is in 
serious trouble." 
</P>
<P>
But residents immediately supported the pavilions, and the project became a 
model of community cooperation. It can take up to two weeks to erect seven 
large pavilions, but merchants needed the structures by the day after 
Thanksgiving, the traditional start of the holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
Word spread about the merchants' plight, and dozens of union locals decided to 
help. During a weekend in mid-November, about 150 union members from throughout 
Northern California arrived in Santa Cruz to volunteer their time. They worked 
all day Saturday and Sunday, erecting the aluminum frames, attaching the hard 
vinyl panels, framing doors, installing electrical wiring, carpeting and 
telephone lines. By Sunday night they had completed the job. 
</P>
<P>
"Word spread fast among union workers that these people needed some help. 
Carpenters told sheet metal workers; sheet metal workers told electricians; 
electricians told plumbers," said Johnathan Boutelle, coordinator for a union 
apprentice program near Santa Cruz. "Hundreds of guys showed up and said: 
'We'll give you a day or two.' It was amazing what we accomplished. We 
basically put up a medium-sized shopping center in two days." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of other volunteers also worked to ensure that businesses would open 
on time. Lawyers negotiated with the company that provided the structures. 
Realtors drew up leases for the pavilions' tenants. Students helped merchants 
remove merchandise from condemned buildings. Residents with pickup trucks 
hauled the merchandise to the pavilions. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago the building that housed Bookshop Santa Cruz was scheduled to 
be demolished and Neal Coonerty faced the daunting task of removing 200,000 
books in two days, transporting them to the pavilions and cataloguing and 
shelving them. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't have done it just with our staff," he said. "But more than 300 
volunteers helped us -- and the community response was so tremendous we had to 
turn away another 300 who wanted to help. We had Rotarians packing books and 
moving boxes alongside radical political activists . . . all sorts of people 
working together to help." 
</P>
<P>
Local businesses donated forklifts, conveyor belts and thousands of boxes, 
Coonerty said. Six librarians volunteered to catalogue books. By the time 
Coonerty opened the day after Thanksgiving, he had transformed an empty 
pavilion into a full-service bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
The pavilion area today bears little resemblance to the quaint strip of 
Victorian buildings and small shops that once lined the mall. Some businesses 
on the mall have reopened, but sidewalks are still fenced off, gaping holes 
where buildings once stood dominate the landscape and throughout the mall 
bricks and rubble are piled up in front of boarded-up buildings. 
</P>
<P>
And the collection of gray pavilions, which resemble a pod of humpbacked whales 
coming up for air, don't add to the aesthetics of the area. From street-level, 
downtown Santa Cruz looks like a war-ravaged city struggling to survive. But 
inside each pavilion, lined with Christmas lights and decorations, filled with 
shoppers, the ambience is the same as any busy shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Each pavilion houses a variety of businesses, and many merchants say the layout 
of the structures is helping sales. Because there are no walls between 
businesses in each pavilion, shoppers are exposed to a variety of stores. And 
the influx of visitors, merchants say, has boosted sales. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting a tremendous amount of out-of-town shoppers -- about a third of 
our checks are from outside Santa Cruz," Groff said. "People are coming in from 
San Mateo, San Rafael, Sonoma -- all over Northern California -- saying: 'We're 
going to shop here and help you out.' " 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the pavilions, a number of businesses nearby have found 
innovative ways to survive until downtown is rebuilt. A shoemaker has set up 
shop in his van and parked it downtown. A delicatessen moved a trailer to an 
empty lot and reopened. And about a dozen shops have relocated to an abandoned 
bank building. 
</P>
<P>
Because merchants might be in the pavilions up to 18 months, they are devising 
a strategy to keep business booming beyond the holidays. They are working with 
local artists to use the empty spaces on the mall, where buildings once stood, 
until construction begins. Sculpture gardens and painted cloth images of 
buildings are planned, merchants say, in addition to kiosks displaying the 
various structures that have occupied the sites over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was worried about whether we would be able to survive after the 
earthquake," said Coonerty of Bookshop Santa Cruz. "And the reason we've been 
able to is because the community gave us a great gift -- the gift of 
patronage." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
The Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake killed 67 people, collapsed more than a mile of 
the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland, knocked out a section of the Bay Bridge and 
caused widespread damage to residential and commercial structures. Property 
damage and destruction was particularly severe in Santa Cruz and nearby 
Watsonville, where hundreds of people remain homeless.

</P>

INSURANCE: VOTER-APPROVED REFORM HAS DRIFTED INTO A LEGAL MORASS, AND 
RESOLUTION OF THE MANY CONFLICTING ACTIONS COULD TAKE YEARS. IN THE MEANTIME, 
COMPANIES ARE MAINTAINING NORMAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a dreary courtroom in the hills overlooking San Francisco International 
Airport, a group of about 40 lawyers are collecting fees totaling more than 
$50,000 a day for work that may ultimately come to naught. 
</P>
<P>
Since Oct. 30, the lawyers have been meeting three days a week in hearings 
under the auspices of the state Insurance Department that mark yet another 
phase in the tortuous life of California's landmark auto insurance initiative. 
The attorneys, nearly all of whom are paid by insurance companies, expect to 
continue their sessions until March. 
</P>
<P>
As drivers anxiously await a resolution to what many view as an auto insurance 
nightmare, efforts to implement Proposition 103 have fallen ever further into a 
legal morass. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the seemingly interminable discussions taking place here, focusing 
for the moment on what constitutes an insurance company's "fair rate of 
return," may have little or nothing to do with what finally happens to auto 
insurance in the state. Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie largely ignored 
the lawyers last week in setting an auto insurance rate ceiling that had never 
even been discussed in the San Bruno courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the insurers have promised to appeal the move. Then again, such an 
appeal would not be necessary if a little-known Sacramento agency, the Office 
of Administrative Law, strikes down Gillespie's regulations in a ruling it is 
expected to deliver today. 
</P>
<P>
But, alas, that action, too, would be subject to legal appeal -- this time by 
Gillespie's lawyers to the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
How it will all eventually work out for the state's car insurance buyers and 
how soon implementation of Proposition 103 can proceed are unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Each legal proceeding can be appealed to a higher, or different, tribunal. The 
process could take years, and some insurance company representatives suggest 
privately that at some point those pushing for change may simply lose interest 
and drift off to other issues, leaving the companies triumphant in their 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the legal wrangling continues on several fronts: 
</P>
<P>
* In Los Angeles on Monday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel will 
hear various insurers' challenge of the current six-month freeze Gillespie has 
imposed on auto insurance rate increases, and the rate ceiling she wants to 
apply when the freeze ends. At the same time Gillespie will ask Vogel to uphold 
her actions. 
</P>
<P>
Vogel also is considering a complaint by Gillespie that the insurers are 
engaged in an illegal conspiracy to block Proposition 103 by legal harassment, 
and the judge also must rule on a move by the Farmers group of companies to 
impose a 5.9% price increase despite the current rate freeze. 
</P>
<P>
All sides are asking Vogel to issue orders supporting their positions. 
</P>
<P>
* In Sacramento, Harvey Rosenfield's Voter Revolt organization has gone before 
Superior Court Judge Richard Park to get all Proposition 103 cases 
"consolidated" in one court, preferably in Sacramento. Voter Revolt says it 
does not trust Judge Vogel's views. Gillespie's attorney, Karl Rubinstein, is 
opposing the motion. 
</P>
<P>
* In San Francisco, the state Supreme Court is in the process of deciding a 
lawsuit brought by the Travelers company seeking to overturn Proposition 103 
and Gillespie's restrictions on a company's right to quit doing business in 
California. Travelers wants to get out of the auto insurance business in the 
state, and if it wins high court assent for doing so, other companies can be 
expected to follow. 
</P>
<P>
* Also in San Francisco, Superior Court Judge John Dearman has issued a broad 
order directing Gillespie to start prosecuting insurance companies for 
violations brought to her attention through consumer complaints. Dearman found 
in favor of a lawsuit brought by Ray Bourhis, one of several Democratic 
candidates to replace Gillespie next year, that said Gillespie had ignored more 
than 30,000 consumer complaints. Gillespie is appealing the action. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, the clear beneficiaries from all this are insurance company 
lawyers and the companies themselves, which have managed to maintain normal 
business practices for more than a year despite all the mandated changes of 
Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
The insurers are paying not only the fees of their own lawyers, but also are 
being assessed by Gillespie for the cost of consumers' lawyers and the cost of 
the hearings, as well as the fees of the Insurance Department's special private 
counsel. But the companies pledge to pass along to customers whatever the 
insurers finally have to pay in fees. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the lawyers are earning healthy compensation from the insurance 
fight. There is no estimate on the total legal fees assessed since Proposition 
103 was approved by the voters on Nov. 8, 1988, but everyone involved agrees 
that it runs into many millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"We should call it 'the Proposition 103 assessment' on our bills (to our 
customers)," suggested one company lawyer here this week. He asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, attorneys such as Paul Alexander, representing State Farm, 
and David Balabanian, representing Fireman's Fund, said that compared to the 
$23 billion in annual premiums the property and casualty insurance companies 
have at stake in California, the legal fees are not particularly high. 
</P>
<P>
Both the San Bruno hearings and many of the other legal proceedings have been 
submerged in a wave of legal briefs filed by both company and consumer lawyers, 
but particularly lawyers for the companies. There are 700 companies doing 
business in California, but only six consumer groups actively pursuing the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
Even issues supposedly already decided -- such as fees for consumer-group 
lawyers at the San Bruno hearings -- have been reopened repeatedly by new 
briefs filed by various insurance companies who claimed they were not party to 
the decision, or that it was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost no week goes by in which some insurance company does not either sue the 
commissioner or file a motion in a pending suit seeking to delay or hinder the 
commissioner in her implementation efforts," said Rubinstein in his complaint 
last week asking Judge Vogel to issue an injunction barring companies from 
conspiring in such tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein's complaint brought an angry rejoiner from George Tye, spokesman for 
the Assn. of California Insurance Companies. "He's trying to say our lawyers 
can't present our points of view," Tye said. "That would be a violation of the 
Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
But, lawyers representing the companies at the San Bruno hearings say that 
their efforts are useful, even if Gillespie does not accept any of the lawyers' 
conclusions. When the hearings are over, the lawyers argue, at least there will 
be a legal record of the hearing's proceedings that they can try to use in 
later court appeals.

GENE LINKED TO RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA BELIEVED ISOLATED BY UCLA SCIENTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA researchers believe they have isolated the gene that causes loss of vision 
in a strain of mice, a defect that serves as a model for retinitis pigmentosa, 
an inherited disease that has produced blindness in about 100,000 Americans and 
1.5 million people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Retinitis pigmentosa, commonly known as RP, is thought to be caused by a number 
of different genes. The gene isolated at UCLA, whose discovery is reported 
today in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is 
the third that has been discovered this year -- one in humans and two in mice 
-- and the fifth overall. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers believe that isolation of the mouse genes will lead to 
discovery of their human counterparts within a few months. Identification of 
the human genes will make it possible to screen fetuses for the genetic defect 
in families with a history of RP. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really a great step forward for us because it will allow us to begin 
thinking . . . about more rational pathways for treatment," said molecular 
geneticist John Nickerson of the National Eye Institute in Bethesda, Md. 
Currently, there is no therapy for RP. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery will also help researchers understand how normal vision works. 
"Every time a new gene is found, we learn something more about the normal 
process (of vision)," said geneticist Jeanette Felix of the RP Foundation 
Fighting Blindness in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
But researchers cautioned that there may be other, as yet unidentified genes 
that also cause RP. And because there are a number of different genes involved 
in causing the disease, it will probably be necessary to develop multiple 
therapies for it, Felix said. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists know that there are three major inheritance patterns for RP: 
X-linked, dominant and recessive. 
</P>
<P>
In the X-linked form, which accounts for about 10% of RP cases, the defective 
gene is found on the X chromosome, which occurs only in males. Such genes are 
the easiest to identify because they are already known to be on the X 
chromosome, and two different X-linked RP genes have been identified in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
In the dominant form, which accounts for about 20% of RP cases, a child who 
receives the gene from either parent will develop the disease. In July, 
researchers from Ireland and Texas reported that they had identified the 
dominant gene that causes RP in a large Irish family. 
</P>
<P>
In the recessive form, which also accounts for about 20% of RP cases, a fetus 
will develop the disease only if it receives a defective gene from both 
parents. In March, Texas researchers reported that they had found a recessive 
RP gene in a strain of mice different from the mice used by the UCLA 
researchers. The UCLA researchers have now found a second recessive gene. 
</P>
<P>
In the remaining 50% of RP cases, only one member of a family has the disease , 
so researchers are not able to identify an inheritance pattern. The disease in 
these cases might be caused by one of the five known RP genes, or it might be 
caused by as-yet-unknown genes. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA team, led by geneticist Debora B. Farber of the Jules Stein Eye 
Institute, has been working with a strain of mice called rd, for retinal 
degeneration. In the rd mice, the photoreceptor cells in their eyes, which 
convert light waves into an electrical signal for transmission to the brain, 
begin to degenerate about nine days after birth. 
</P>
<P>
Within 15 days after birth, half the photoreceptors are gone and by the end of 
the first month, the mice are completely blind. Farber's group had previously 
identified the biochemical defect that causes this cell death, a defective 
enzyme that allows a chemical normally present in the photoreceptor cells to 
build up to toxic levels. 
</P>
<P>
Farber and her colleagues have now isolated from the photoreceptor cells of 
these mice a piece of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic blueprint of 
life) that is different from its counterpart in healthy mice. They believe, but 
have not yet conclusively proved, that the DNA fragment is the gene that causes 
the disease. 
</P>
<P>
The group is currently trying to identify each of the 3,600 individual 
chemicals, called bases, of which the fragment is composed. When they have done 
that, they will know whether the fragment is the blueprint for the enzyme known 
to be defective in the rd mice, and thus whether it is the gene that causes the 
disease.

Because they are confident that it is the gene, however, they are already 
searching for a corresponding piece of DNA in human cells. Because of their 
similarity in function, the human gene should be closely related to the mouse 
gene, making its identification relatively easy. Farber said the group hopes to 
find it "within a few months." 
</P>
<P>
And once the human gene has been identified, a prenatal test for it can be 
developed within a matter of weeks.

ALASKA VOLCANO ERUPTS, SENDS ASH 7 MILES HIGH

Redoubt volcano southwest of Anchorage shook with thousands of small 
earthquakes Thursday, then erupted and shot a cloud of ash 7 miles high. 
</P>
<P>
The eruption of the 10,197-foot volcano began shortly after 10 a.m. and lasted 
for an hour, U.S. Geological Survey geologist Don Richter said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's steaming vigorously," volcanologist Tom Miller said on his return from a 
flight to the volcano 100 miles southwest of Anchorage. "There's steady 
pulsating and a steam cloud but no more ash." 
</P>
<P>
He said there was no immediate evidence of a lava flow. 
</P>
<P>
The eruption followed 24 hours of constant warning tremors, which calmed down 
after the eruption ended, then picked up again, Miller said. Scientists were 
unable to predict whether Redoubt would settle down or explode again. 
</P>
<P>
Workers were evacuated from the Drift River crude oil storage site 22 miles 
from the exploding mountain, but there appeared to be no danger to the facility 
and 37 million gallons of oil stored there from Cook Inlet drilling platforms, 
Cook Inlet Pipe Line Co. manager Harold Mouser said. He said no tankers were 
due to pick up oil at the facility until next week. 
</P>
<P>
The ash plume -- which shot 35,000 feet above the 2-mile-high mountain -- was 
carried toward Anchorage by strong winds, National Weather Service 
meteorologist Bob Hopkins said. But the ash cloud skirted Anchorage and dusted 
towns beyond the city. 
</P>
<P>
Wasilla and other small cities north of Anchorage received light ash fall, said 
Kevin Koechlein, emergency services coordinator for the Matanuska-Susitna 
Borough. "I have a pile of it sitting on my desk," he said of the fine, sandy 
ash. 
</P>
<P>
Terrie Godfrey of the Wasilla Chamber of Commerce said that the ash is "thick 
enough that I had to turn my windshield wipers on. There's little bitty 
speckles." 
</P>
<P>
Radio stations warned people with respiratory problems to remain inside because 
of the ash. 
</P>
<P>
Ash was falling over unpopulated mountainous areas also, and some of the debris 
was dissipating in the atmosphere, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration issued flight restrictions, warning pilots 
to steer 15 miles clear of Redoubt because ash can damage jet engines. 
Anchorage International Airport officials reported no interference with flights 
such as occurred in 1986, when Augustine volcano erupted. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said his surveillance flight showed that the volcano blew a hole in a 
vent left over from its last eruption more than 20 years ago. Redoubt erupted 
in 1902, 1933 and several times during a period of activity from 1965 to 1968. 
</P>
<P>
He said there was no indication that the eruption and heavy steaming were 
suddenly melting snow on the mountain, which occurred during Redoubt's 1966 
eruption and caused flash flooding on the Drift River. The oil storage area 
there, built after Redoubt's last eruption, is protected by dikes in case of 
new flooding, Mouser said. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen oil workers at Drift River were the closest people to the volcano, and 
Mouser said they would stay out of the area until it is safe to return. 
</P>
<P>
Redoubt gave short notice that it might explode. The mountain, visible from 
Anchorage on a clear day, let off a little steam last week, as all active 
volcanoes do occasionally. But it was not until seismic monitors showed 
constant earth tremors Wednesday and Thursday that geologists and emergency 
services officials mobilized.

A woman whose family burned to death in a 1982 car fire won a $43.2-million 
judgment in a state court in Houston against Toyota, the largest award ever 
entered against the company. Nike Adegbite, 36, had watched while her husband 
and two daughters died in the burning car. Two other people also died in the 
fire when the woman's 1973 Toyota Corona station wagon caught fire after being 
rear-ended on a Houston highway. The plaintiff's lawyer had argued that the 
crash pushed the station wagon's fuel tank forward, puncturing the tank on an 
empty spare tire carrier and a valve on the rear axle.

U.S. AGENCY HEEDED WARNINGS OF A COUP;

PHILIPPINES: AMERICANS SHIFTED A CONFERENCE AWAY FROM MANILA BEFORE THE 
REBELLION. OFFICIALS ARE ASKING WHY OTHERS DID NOT TAKE SIMILAR MEASURES.

Officials of the U.S. Agency for International Development took warnings of an 
attempted coup against President Corazon Aquino so seriously that they quietly 
banned travel to the Philippines two weeks before the rebellion erupted Dec. 1, 
derailing a long-planned 12-nation conference on narcotics control that would 
have taken place at the height of the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
According to documents obtained by The Times, AID officials in Washington 
issued an order prohibiting AID employees, consultants and sponsored students 
from traveling to the Philippines beginning Nov. 13, the day after Aquino 
returned to Manila from a visit to the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The order, apparently the first time AID has prohibited visits here, raises 
questions about why no other U.S. agency or the Philippine military took steps 
to prepare for the uprising, the sixth and most serious against the Aquino 
government. In interviews, Philippine officials said the decision adds to 
growing evidence that key warnings were ignored or not shared. 
</P>
<P>
The Philippine military was caught off guard when about 3,000 rebellious 
soldiers attacked and quickly secured key military bases in Manila. The 
failure, or sabotage, of intelligence has led several embassies, including the 
United States', to re-evaluate their intelligence operations and step up 
indirect contacts with the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Several embassies, including West Germany's and New Zealand's, have started 
preparing contingency plans to evacuate their citizens in the event of another 
attempted coup. 
</P>
<P>
Scuttled Workshop 
</P>
<P>
The AID ban on travel effectively scuttled an AID-funded drug-prevention 
workshop planned since 1987 and scheduled for Nov. 27 to Dec. 2 at the 
University of the Philippines. Officials from 11 other countries, including 
Thailand, Laos and Afghanistan, which account for more than 80% of the heroin 
sold in the United States, had accepted invitations. 
</P>
<P>
A second AID-funded conference on public health, scheduled for Dec. 11 at the 
University of the Philippines, was also canceled. 
</P>
<P>
The drug conference was shifted to Bangkok, Thailand, at an additional cost to 
the United States of several thousand dollars. Philippine narcotics officials 
boycotted the Bangkok meeting and have recommended to Aquino that her 
government lodge a formal protest with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We were caught flat-footed with our pants down at the last-minute 
cancellation," Manuel M. Supnet, executive director of the Philippine Dangerous 
Drugs Board, complained. 
</P>
<P>
The travel ban not only rankled Philippine officials but has raised suspicions 
as well. "As early as that date, the U.S. knew something was going to happen," 
a Philippine official said. 
</P>
<P>
AID officials in Manila said the travel ban was brought on not by secret 
information but by widespread, unconfirmed reports of plotting, including local 
newspaper accounts. One official said other U.S. agencies, including the 
embassy in Manila, had the same information but that "other agencies didn't 
come to that conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
"If anything," he said, "it was a delayed reaction to the Aquino visit to the 
U.S." 
</P>
<P>
He said that any suspicion that AID, an arm of the U.S. State Department, knew 
more than other agencies is "incredibly fanciful." 
</P>
<P>
"It was embarrassing to have these conferences canceled," he added. "The (U.S.) 
ambassador was not pleased." 
</P>
<P>
Caused Hard Feelings 
</P>
<P>
Another AID official said the cancellation had caused "hard feelings and 
irritation." He agreed that AID officials in Washington had no special 
warnings, and added, "We don't think Washington is that smart." 
</P>
<P>
David Andresen, a U.S. Embassy spokesman, said Thursday that neither Ambassador 
Nicholas Platt nor the AID mission here, the third-largest in the world, had 
recommended or agreed with the travel ban. 
</P>
<P>
"It sort of took us by surprise," Andresen said. "What basis they had, I really 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
A top Aquino aide in the presidential palace also sought to minimize the 
significance of the AID decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the Americans were hearing the same information we were and 
discarding it the same way we were," he said. He noted that other U.S. 
agencies, including the CIA, apparently ignored the coup warnings. The CIA 
knew, he said, "but they didn't give it much credence." 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. Embassy official, in a briefing earlier this week, defended the 
embassy's apparent inaction. He said the embassy had recorded 700 coup warnings 
in 1988 and 900 this year. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine officials first heard of the AID travel ban on Nov. 15, when Joel M. 
Jutkowitz, a Virginia-based subcontractor running the drug workshop for AID, 
suddenly insisted in a letter transmitted by facsimile that the Nov. 27 
conference be moved to Bangkok, citing "reasons beyond our control." 
</P>
<P>
Supnet said he spoke with Jutkowitz by telephone on Nov. 16, the day after the 
letter arrived, and that Jutkowitz was vague about the reason behind the 
decision. "He told me they received instructions from the U.S. Department of 
State for a total embargo on travel by U.S. AID (to the Philippines)," Supnet 
said. "At that time, no one (here) expected there would be a coup." 
</P>
<P>
According to the documents, Jutkowitz, who is the director of the Asia/Near 
East Regional Narcotics Education Program of Development Associates Inc., of 
Arlington, Va., apologized to Philippine officials for the decision to move the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Expressing his "profound regret," Jutkowitz offered to send an unlimited number 
of Philippine officials to Bangkok, with all expenses paid by the U.S. 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Describing it as "a junket to Bangkok," an angry Supnet said that his Dangerous 
Drugs Board decided at an emergency meeting to boycott the meeting.

The voluntary repatriation of tens of thousands of Ethiopians who sought refuge 
in Somalia 12 years ago during a war between Ethiopia and Somalia should begin 
in March, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The refugees are predominantly ethnic Somali Ethiopians who fled the fighting 
during the two nations' war in 1977-78 over a piece of arid land in 
southeastern Ethiopia called the Ogaden. 
</P>
<P>
The number of refugees has never been certain. Somalia says there are 700,000, 
the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees puts the figure at 
160,000 and Ethiopia says they number about 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Somalia has begun registering some of the refugees. They will be asked if they 
want to return to Ethiopia. Those who don't will be granted limited assistance 
to help them settle in Somalia.

SYRIA SAID TO PLAN MOVE ON FLIGHT 103 SUSPECTS

The State Department on Thursday said it has obtained a commitment from Syrian 
President Hafez Assad to crack down on the Damascus-based Palestinian terrorist 
group that remains the prime suspect in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 if he 
is presented with "firm evidence" of its involvement. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the United States has been told 
"at the highest levels" of the Syrian government that "if it is presented with 
firm evidence that any group or individuals within its purview are responsible 
for Pan Am 103, the Syrian government will take action against them." 
</P>
<P>
" . . .To date, we're not satisfied with the Syrian government's responses, and 
we think (it) can do more," Boucher said. "We have discussed Pan Am 103 with 
the Syrians on a number of occasions in diplomatic channels. We have urged 
their full cooperation in finding those responsible." 
</P>
<P>
Administration sources said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III had 
personally approved Thursday's statement on Syrian responsibility for terrorist 
groups operating from Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
The statement was the clearest public indication yet that the U.S. government 
is convinced that elements of the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command led by Ahmed Jibril were behind the midair bombing of 
a Pan American World Airways Boeing 747 jumbo jet. The bombing and jet crash 
caused the deaths of 270 people at Lockerbie, Scotland, last December. 
</P>
<P>
Jibril's headquarters are in Damascus, and a number of his training camps are 
located in Syrian-controlled areas of eastern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
No U.S. official has suggested that Syria was responsible for the Pan Am 
bombing. Rather, the prevailing U.S. view is that Iran ordered it in 
retaliation for the accidental shooting down by a U.S. Navy warship of an 
Iranian Airbus over the Persian Gulf in July, 1988.

A little-known Muslim group Thursday threatened to kill Pope John Paul II for 
his support of Lebanon's rebellious Christian leader, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun. 
</P>
<P>
The communique from the group, the Organization for the Defense of the 
Oppressed, also told the Roman Catholic envoy living in Lebanon, Papal Nuncio 
Pablo Puente, "to leave the Lebanese territories as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The statement was delivered to a Western news agency as the Pope was being 
criticized by Lebanese leftists for failing to receive Arab mediators seeking 
to end the 14-year-old civil war between Muslims and Christians. 
</P>
<P>
"The Organization for the Defense of the Oppressed, after consultations with 
its forces fighting international arrogance, announces that it has issued the 
death sentence on the Pope of Rome," said the handwritten, Arabic message. 
</P>
<P>
The 92-word statement said the killing will be carried out "sooner or later." 
It charged that the pontiff "has become the spiritual guide of the mutinous 
crusaders in East Beirut," a reference to Aoun and his supporters in the 
Christian enclave north of the capital who have rejected a new Christian-Muslim 
government. Aoun wants specific guarantees about the withdrawal of Syrian 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Pope said the Vatican "cannot remain neutral" and that "it is 
time . . . for sacrifices for the sake of peace." In what at the time appeared 
to be an appeal to Aoun to back down, the message added: "One should sometimes 
choose the less painful options." 
</P>
<P>
There was nothing to authenticate the Muslim group's statement, which used 
Shiite Muslim fundamentalist language similar to that of pro-Iranian extremist 
factions holding most of the Western hostages in Lebanon, including nine 
Americans. The group issued one previous unauthenticated statement Aug. 28, 
threatening to kill the Pope if he visited Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers and radio stations controlled by the leftists and Muslims in Beirut 
said the Saudi Arabian, Moroccan and Algerian foreign ministers were in Rome on 
Wednesday during a tour of Arab and Western countries aimed at bringing 
pressure on Aoun.

A leader of West Germany's Jewish community who died last year embezzled nearly 
$16 million in government funds intended for Holocaust survivors, according to 
a report released in West Berlin. The report added that attempts to get the 
money back have been unsuccessful. After the January, 1988, death of Werner 
Nachmann, the 62-year-old chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, 
investigators found he had run a massive embezzlement scheme involving 
reparations paid by the West German government.

The military rulers of Sudan are planning to revive Islamic sharia laws, 
Sudanese and diplomatic sources in Khartoum said. The Islamic laws are fiercely 
opposed by non-Muslim rebels fighting a civil war in the south, and their 
revival in the mainly Arab and Muslim north would diminish hopes of peace. The 
Sudan People's Liberation Army has been fighting a civil war since 1983 in the 
Christian and animist south.

Palestinian uprising. The town in the Israeli-occupied West Bank is revered as 
the birthplace of Jesus. Municipal officials in Beit Sahur, another city that 
is home to Christian Arabs, also said they will call off their Christmas 
celebrations to back the uprising. Beit Sahur is surrounded by fields where 
Christians believe the birth of Jesus was announced to shepherds.

Community on Thursday by postponing an agreement with its closest Western 
neighbors while at the same time moving toward a closer new relationship with 
East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The West German government announced that it was holding off on concluding what 
had been called a landmark treaty that would eliminate border controls with 
France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, in East Berlin, the West Germans disclosed that they are 
setting up a joint economic commission with East Germans to explore such 
matters as trade and investment. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time," a foreign policy analyst commented, "that West 
Germany has allowed East German considerations to take precedence over European 
Community considerations. It could be a worrying precedent." 
</P>
<P>
The analyst, asking not to be identified by name, said: "The West Germans keep 
saying they are firmly embedded in the West and its institutions, but actions 
speak louder than words." 
</P>
<P>
In much of the West, the Bonn government is being carefully watched to see if 
developments in East Germany lead it to focus its attention on the East to the 
detriment of Western relations. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called Schengen Treaty, named for a frontier town in Luxembourg, was to 
have been signed today. It anticipates a phasing out of border inspections, 
increased police cooperation and a common policy on travel visas and ways of 
dealing with people seeking asylum. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty was to go into effect in mid-1991 and was widely regarded as a model 
for a broader agreement among the 12 countries of the European Community, which 
plan to do away with border controls in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
West German officials were uncommonly reticent about their reasons for delaying 
the treaty. They would say only that the signing had been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers of the Netherlands, addressing Parliament in 
The Hague, said that West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl wanted the delay in 
order to permit discussion of how developments in East Germany might affect the 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl reportedly was persuaded by members of his Parliament to delay the signing 
until it is made clear that East Germans have the same freedom as West Germans 
to travel within the countries involved. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's constitution does not recognize a separate East German state, 
and East Germans are treated for all practical purposes like West Germans. This 
has given East Germany de facto status as a member of the European Community, 
able to ship its goods duty-free into West Germany and from there on to the 
other 11 member countries. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's partners in the Schengen Treaty are concerned that, if East 
Germany is included, undesirables might use East Germany as a way into West 
Germany and on into their countries. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the joint economic commission was reached at a meeting between 
the West German minister for economics, Helmut Haussmann, and three East German 
officials, Prime Minister Hans Modrow, Foreign Trade Minister Gerhard Beill and 
Finance Minister Christa Luft. It is expected to be ready for signature when 
Kohl and Modrow meet next week. 
</P>
<P>
It calls for closer economic cooperation between the two Germanys as East-West 
barriers come down. According to Haussmann, 40% of West German companies have 
expressed interest "in investing or cooperating in East German economic 
development." 
</P>
<P>
East German spokesman Wolfgang Meyer told reporters in East Berlin that the 
Kohl-Modrow meeting will be "of extraordinary significance for our country's 
economic development."

<P>
Up to 50,000 of Bulgaria's newly vocal citizens jeered and whistled in the 
square outside the Parliament building Thursday when lawmakers decided that 
they could not legally repeal the Communist monopoly on power for another 
month. 
</P>
<P>
New party chief Petar Mladenov, who has promised reform, tried to address the 
crowd later and was shouted down. 
</P>
<P>
"We will do our best to meet the demands of the people for democracy!" he 
called out. The crowd responded, "We don't want you!" 
</P>
<P>
He shouted back: "We want to assure you of our responsibility for the fate of 
Bulgaria, that we all want democracy! If you do not believe us, this could lead 
us to tragedy!" 
</P>
<P>
The crowd's answer: "Resign! Resign!" 
</P>
<P>
About half the crowd in the square had heeded a call to disperse from Zheliu 
Zhelev, an opposition leader, by the time Mladenov and other officials emerged 
from the building. 
</P>
<P>
Zhelev asked the crowd to return today. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be here!" they shouted. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament later issued a declaration, rejecting "all attempts to pressure its 
decision-making process by undemocratic means," the state news agency BTA 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said the protesters showed "political vulgarity and intolerance" 
and intended to "bring disunity to the nation and to cause destabilization." 
</P>
<P>
Mladenov rose to power when Todor Zhivkov, who ran a Stalinist state for 35 
years, was forced out Nov. 10. The new party leader has promised dialogue with 
independent groups and free elections by May. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday the policy-making Central Committee voted to relinquish the 
party's leading role, as parties elsewhere in Eastern Europe have done. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament approved a Communist Party motion Thursday to discuss removing 
Article 1 of the constitution, which guarantees party supremacy, but members 
said action could not be taken immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Speaker of Parliament Stanko Todorov told lawmakers that for constitutional 
reasons, the article in the constitution that guarantees the party's leading 
role in society could not be discussed until the next session in January. 
</P>
<P>
While members deliberated inside, the crowd chanted "We are here!" and "Come 
out! Come out!" Some formed a human chain around the building. 
</P>
<P>
More protesters arrived. Deputy Speaker Atanas Dimitrov went outside and 
accepted a resolution from Zhelev outlining demands for reform: abolition of 
the party's lock on power, talks with the opposition and free elections. 
</P>
<P>
It was the same manifesto approved Sunday at a cheering, snow-swept rally of 
50,000 opposition supporters in the heart of Sofia. 
</P>
<P>
At the three-day meeting that ended Wednesday, the Central Committee accepted 
the essence of the demands. 
</P>
<P>
As the protesters rallied outside Parliament on Thursday, deputy Alexander 
Dimitrov challenged the decision to postpone a vote on the party monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are talking about a democratic society, (people will) ask what we are 
about if we don't cancel Article 1," he said. "If our electorate outside is to 
respect us, the first step is to cancel Article 1." 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of deputies took the floor, a new experience in a chamber where for 
years hands had been raised automatically to approve Zhivkov's orders. 
</P>
<P>
Membership changes also are on Parliament's agenda, which means that Zhivkov, 
his son, Vladimir, and Milko Balev, a close associate, probably will lose their 
seats. The party expelled them Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers also are to consider removing clauses on anti-state activity from the 
penal code and passing new laws on assembly and association. 
</P>
<P>
After the agenda was adopted Thursday, Speaker Todorov declared that the 
assembly should end its practice of voting unanimously by show of hands. 
"Voting without thinking" has been harmful, he said.. 
</P>
<P>
"The people . . . require us to do something," Todorov told the legislators. 
"Questions cannot be resolved from above. . . . Power means responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
A taste of democracy was not the only thing on the crowd's mind Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Chants of "Millionaires! Bandits! Mafia!" rose into cold air -- references to 
allegations that Zhivkov and his friends lived luxuriously in mansions and 
hunting lodges.

<P>
East Germany's Communist government sought to satisfy a major demand of the 
country's mass opposition movement Thursday by abolishing the state agency in 
charge of the huge and hated secret police apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the Office of National Security told Western journalists that the 
institution was being shut down and its responsibilities distributed among 
other ministries. The office was created last month to replace the State 
Security Agency, popularly known as the Stasi, which ran a vast network of 
agents to spy on East Germans and repress internal dissent. 
</P>
<P>
No details of the reorganization of the security apparatus were available 
Thursday. Government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer, while confirming that the 
Cabinet had acted on the issue, said no official information will be released 
until the government reports on its actions at a "round table" of political 
parties and opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition groups demanded the dismantling of the domestic secret police at the 
first meeting of the round table last week. Earlier, crowds of demonstrators 
around the country had occupied or besieged the regional and local offices of 
the Stasi in cities around East Germany, in part to prevent the destruction of 
evidence of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Ad hoc citizens' committees in Dresden, Rostock and other cities are still 
standing guard around the state security buildings and overseeing their 
operations. Though the present security forces chief, Wolfgang Schwanitz, has 
described the occupations as violent "stormings," no injuries have been 
reported and tensions appear to have diminished in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
Even without the official action taken Thursday, the state security apparatus 
around the country has been rapidly collapsing. Seventeen top officials of the 
agency were forced to resign last week, and Schwanitz said personnel have been 
reduced by up to 50% in some divisions as agents were sent to work in mines, 
border checkpoints or the transport industry. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the agency said Wednesday that in addition to the occupations 
in big cities, local security offices in many small towns are being closed in 
cooperation with opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Meyer said at his weekly news conference after the Cabinet 
meeting that while the government is seeking to satisfy the round-table groups' 
concerns about the security forces, the service would not be abolished. East 
Germany will continue to keep up a security apparatus, "like every other 
country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition groups and the citizens' committees now monitoring the former Stasi 
installations have said they would tolerate a continued spy service only if it 
were directed exclusively toward external enemies. They have also demanded the 
trial of dozens of former Stasi officers accused of corruption or abuse of 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer said that the special hospital used by the state security will be opened 
to the public soon and that the now-notorious compound where the country's 
Communist leaders have lived will be turned into a 400-bed rehabilitation 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Former Communist leader Erich Honecker and several other deposed officials are 
still living under house arrest in the well-appointed villas of the Wandlitz 
compound near East Berlin. But Meyer said that Honecker would have to move out 
by February so that the new medical rehabilitation center could be installed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one of the country's principal new opposition groups proposed a 
three-point plan leading to a neutral confederation of German states. A press 
conference by the Democracy Now group in East Berlin reflected the growing 
sentiment in the country for a move toward union with West Germany.

CHINESE DISSIDENT FANG MAY BE FREED IN WAKE OF BEIJING MISSION; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: HIS RELEASE FROM REFUGE IN THE EMBASSY WOULD END A MAJOR IRRITANT IN 
U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS.

<P>
In the wake of National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft's mission to China, 
evidence is mounting that the United States and China are moving towards a deal 
that would free China's most famous dissident, Fang Lizhi, and his wife from 
their six-month confinement inside the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Fang, a prominent astrophysicist who said last year that Marxism "is no longer 
of much use in China," took refuge inside the embassy last June, three days 
after Chinese troops crushed the pro-democracy movement at Tian An Men Square. 
He was accompanied by his wife, Li Shuxian, also a leading critic of the 
Chinese Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Fang's case has become one of the principal obstacles to the Bush 
Administration's effort to improve the strained relations between the United 
States and China. Fang's release from the embassy would enable the Bush 
Administration to show it has obtained some tangible results from Scowcroft's 
trip to China, which drew intense criticism in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The first clue that the Administration might be seeking to resolve Fang's fate 
came Tuesday, when the White House confirmed that Chase Untermeyer, President 
Bush's White House assistant for personnel, accompanied Scowcroft and Deputy 
Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger on their trip to Beijing last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Untermeyer has worked for Bush since the mid-1970s and is one of his closest 
aides, the man assigned to soothe large egos and disgruntled personnel. He has 
no foreign policy experience and reportedly did not take part in the formal 
meetings which Scowcroft and Eagleburger held with Chinese leaders. A White 
House spokesman explained that while in Beijing, Untermeyer met with two old 
friends of Bush, whose names were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Untermeyer had held talks with Fang inside the U.S. Embassy 
during the delegation's 25-hour stay in Beijing, a U.S. official active in 
China policy replied Thursday: "I just can't comment on that. . . . It's 
probably reasonable for you to assume that he might have, because he is a close 
friend of Bush's and had some time on his hands in Beijing." 
</P>
<P>
While refusing to confirm that a deal is in the works for Fang's release, this 
U.S. official replied: "Whatever might be worked out would be strictly in 
accordance with what Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian want. Nothing will be dictated 
to them, either by the Chinese or by us." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, in a new indication that the Bush Administration and China are 
seeking a settlement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry suddenly changed its 
official position concerning Fang. 
</P>
<P>
For the past half-year, China has refused to take any steps to end Fang's 
confinement. The Chinese regime quickly denounced Fang as a traitor and 
"counterrevolutionary" and issued a warrant for his arrest, insisting that the 
only possible way out was for the United States to turn him over to Chinese 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever started the trouble should end it," a spokesman for China's State 
Council, Yuan Mu, said last July. "The final solution lies with the U.S. side." 
</P>
<P>
But when asked about Fang at a weekly news briefing Thursday in Beijing, 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua omitted any harsh condemnation of 
the Chinese dissident and called the U.S. Embassy's sheltering of him a 
"sensitive question." 
</P>
<P>
"Solving the problem will require effort on both sides," said the Chinese 
spokesman, thus acknowledging for the first time that China is willing to help 
resolve Fang's case. 
</P>
<P>
It is not yet clear exactly what the outlines of a deal for Fang's release 
might be. 
</P>
<P>
The most likely outcome would be for China to let him go abroad. China would 
have to withdraw its heavy security presence around the U.S. Embassy and permit 
Fang to be taken out of it, across Chinese soil, to the Beijing airport. That 
would mean either withdrawing or ignoring the warrant for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
If Fang is permitted to go overseas, he would probably emerge as an eloquent 
spokesman and unifying force for the democracy movement among Chinese exiles 
and students overseas. For that reason, some U.S. specialists have said they 
believe China might prefer to keep Fang bottled up inside the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
However, a U.S. official said in October that "as long as he (Fang) is in 
there, he'll be an obstacle to improvement in our relations. And a big one." 
</P>
<P>
Both China and the Bush Administration might want to avoid having Fang settle 
in the United States, where his flamboyant attacks on the totalitarian nature 
of the Chinese Communist Party would might make him a continuing irritant 
between the governments. There are more than 40,000 Chinese students in the 
United States, by far the largest group in any country outside China. 
</P>
<P>
One possible solution would be for Fang to settle in another country. France, 
for example, has already emerged as a haven for Chinese intellectuals and 
political dissidents, some of whom have been denied visas to come to the United 
States. It is unclear, however, whether Fang would go along with a deal between 
the Bush Administration and China that denies him access to the United States 
or limits his ability to travel. 
</P>
<P>
On at least one occasion since June, the Bush Administration has sought to curb 
public recognition for Fang in this country. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, State Department officials sought to dissuade the Robert F. Kennedy 
Memorial Foundation from presenting its annual human rights award to the 
Chinese dissident on grounds that the award could complicate efforts to end 
Fang's confinement. 
</P>
<P>
Foundation officials postponed the ceremonies on one occasion but then went 
ahead with the award. From Beijing, Fang sent a written acceptance speech in 
which he said that China's 1.1 billion people "can and must enjoy the same 
inalienable rights, dignity and liberty as other human beings." 
</P>
<P>
The release of Fang would help the Bush Administration to stave off efforts in 
Congress, in response to the June 3-4 massacre, to enact legislation imposing 
economic sanctions against China and protecting Chinese students in the United 
States from being required to return home. 
</P>
<P>
"It (Fang's release) would be enough to carry a number of Republicans," said a 
top Senate GOP aide. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, press spokesman Marlin Fitzwater was asked Thursday whether 
he expected any action concerning Fang. "Nothing to report," Fitzwater replied.

Courageous retirement home residents helped their less able neighbors escape a 
pre-dawn fire Thursday that killed four people and injured 23 others, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The residents, many in their pajamas, fled into the 19-degree cold as smoke 
filled the six-story building. Those in wheelchairs or using walkers were 
assisted by fellow residents and rescue personnel. Some TV cameramen also 
pitched in to help with the evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
"The smoke was horrible!" Louise Dudney, 79, said through tears as she sat on a 
bench in her pink house robe at a skating rink being used as a shelter. "I 
thought I couldn't make it but told myself, 'I'm going to make it.' I ran out 
and started knocking on doors." 
</P>
<P>
Marjorie Branson, 78, wrapped in a blanket, said: "I left my walker, got my 
cane and everybody helped each other get out." 
</P>
<P>
Resident fire captains assigned to each floor coordinated the evacuation, which 
had been rehearsed in recent drills, and reported room numbers to sheriff's 
deputies and firefighters when no one answered the knocks, chaplain R. C. 
Wilson said.

A nurse was convicted Thursday of killing four hospital patients in a scheme to 
make them ill, revive them and be recognized as a hero. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Angelo, 27, of Lindenhurst, sat hunched over and stared straight ahead 
during the reading of the verdict finding him guilty of murder in two deaths, 
manslaughter in one and criminally negligent homicide in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Injections, with lethal doses of muscle relaxants, were given patients at Good 
Samaritan Hospital in West Islip on Long Island in 1987. The defense 
acknowledged that Angelo injected the patients but said he did not mean to kill 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo also was convicted of various degrees of assault in connection with the 
deaths and on three counts of assault in connection with injections he 
administered to one patient who survived. That patient, a 75-year-old man, 
described in court how he had fought for breath after a man had injected him. 
</P>
<P>
He could be sent to prison for 50 years to life for the murders when he is 
sentenced on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
"What this guy did to all of these people is beyond words," said a sobbing 
Kieran Greene, 24, of North Babylon, whose father, Anthony, was one of Angelo's 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
"Enjoy jail, Angelo, for the rest of your life," said Greene, who entered the 
courthouse when he heard there was a verdict and hugged prosecutor John 
Collins.

Suffolk County officials exhumed 33 bodies of patients who died suspiciously 
during Angelo's tenure at Good Samaritan. The medical examiner found traces of 
Pavulon in six of the bodies exhumed. He determined that Pavulon directly 
caused the death of four of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution linked Angelo to the Pavulon through Angelo's admissions in 
videotaped and written statements and by a syringe laced with Pavulon found in 
his apartment before he was arrested.

CONGRESS TO HOST MEETING ON GLOBAL WARMING ISSUE; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: SENATORS SAY IT'S TIME TO ACT ON PRESSING ISSUES. BUT THEY DENY 
SEEKING TO UPSTAGE THE ADMINISTRATION.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Getting a jump on the Bush Administration, Congress announced Thursday that a 
first-ever conference of legislators from 33 nations will be convened in 
Washington next spring to consider global warming and other environmental 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
While it will precede by six months an international meeting on global warming 
to be hosted by President Bush, Senate sponsors of the April 29-May 2 meeting 
said it is intended to spur international cooperation, not to upstage the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe the time for action is now," said Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.), 
chairman of the Senate delegation to the conference. "We are ready to move." 
</P>
<P>
Gore insisted that the conference was not an exercise in one-upmanship. "This 
is in no way partisan," he said. "We are not taking an adversarial position 
against the Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Others in the seven-member Senate delegation said the meeting would give the 
United States a chance again to assume leadership on worldwide environmental 
issues that had been lost during the Reagan Administration. A House delegation 
will be named later. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional sources said the conference of lawmakers -- authorized by 
legislation approved last August -- reflected a bipartisan concern that Bush 
was not responding fast enough to serious global problems despite his call for 
a major overhaul of the nation's clean-air laws. 
</P>
<P>
About 250 legislators -- including some from the Soviet Union, Poland and 
Hungary, but none from China -- were invited to the spring conference. The 
participants will seek consensus on a new set of environmental goals to deal 
with global warming and other major concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Gore said climate change, deforestation, the spread of deserts, depletion of 
the ozone layer, vanishing species, the impact of population growth and 
prospects for sustainable development would be the leading issues before the 
conference of lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
"The global ecological crisis we face demands unprecedented responses such as 
this -- the first-ever gathering of the legislators ultimately responsible for 
... policies needed to change our future and the course of our world for 
generations to come," Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.) said the United States should take the lead on 
global environmental problems. By the time the conference is held, Chafee 
predicted, the Senate will have approved a clean-air bill that would eliminate 
production of chlorofluorocarbons by the year 2000 and reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions from cars. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) said the conference would enable the United States to 
regain its pre-eminent position on environmental issues. Sen. John Heinz 
(R-Pa.) contended that the federal government was lagging behind the states and 
individual citizens on these issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Environmental isolationism must be a way of the past," Senate Majority Leader 
George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said in a statement. "Our planet has become too 
small to insist on acting alone or to insist on acting only if everyone adopts 
the same policy." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush had initially resisted calls for an international conference on 
global warming. During his Malta talks with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, however, Bush reversed himself and announced that the United States 
would host such a meeting next fall. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration was criticized at a meeting in the Netherlands last month 
when it opposed efforts by virtually all other industrialized nations to limit 
gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
In February, two months before the congressional conference, an International 
Panel on Climate Change composed of scientists and other experts will meet in 
Washington to consider new evidence on global warming and devise ways to deal 
with it.

Christopher Knight, formerly the art critic of the Los Angeles Herald Examiner, 
is now writing art commentary and criticism for Calendar. His initial review is 
of a show at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art that surveys the first 
significant movement in modern art indigenous to California. The exhibition, 
"Bay Area Figurative Art: 1950-1965," isn't daring in its approach, but it does 
shed a lot of light on a pivotal period in postwar American art.

'FAMILY BUSINESS': IT'S A CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Family Business" (citywide) is a frail little caper movie that's overawed by 
its cast. With Sean Connery, Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick playing three 
generations of a family, you've got a lot of talent at your disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Forget for the moment the fact that, in this movie about the persistence of 
family genes, none of the actors remotely resembles each other. Forget, too, 
that Dustin Hoffman is seven years younger than Connery, who plays his father 
here. Years of agent-inspired casting have inured audiences to weirder confabs 
than this. 
</P>
<P>
But there should be a pay-off to the oddness, some compelling dramatic reason 
for these three to get together. Like a good script, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the movie lays out a slew of half-baked ideas and never turns on the 
burner. The contrived plot is set in motion by Adam (Matthew Broderick), a 
science whiz who has recently dropped out of a master's program in molecular 
biology. What he wants to become is a thief like his grandfather, Jessie 
(Connery), whom he helps bail out of jail when the film opens. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that Adam's father, Vito (Hoffman), now the owner of a meat 
packing company, was also a thief. Both Jessie and Vito served time in jail. 
The difference between them is that Vito has renounced the life while Jessie 
isn't adverse to a stretch in the slammer. He thinks it builds character. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney Lumet, who directed from a script by Vincent Patrick based on his own 
novel, is highly regarded as an "actor's director." That encomium only applies 
however, when he's dealing with material his actors can chew on. In "Family 
Business," watching these three extraordinarily talented performers try to 
breathe some life into the story is a bit like watching a magic show that never 
takes off. 
</P>
<P>
The actors seem to know it, too, at least Hoffman and Broderick. They don't 
supply much relish. Connery has a better time of it, largely because he 
dispenses with the film's dour realism and tries for something folkloric, 
larger-than-life. 
</P>
<P>
Connery's performance is immensely entertaining while not being believable for 
a moment. How can it be? The role is a screenwriter's conceit. Jessie's free 
spiritedness is supposed to link up with Adam's. Adam wants to be a thief 
because he rejects the middle-class safety of his father's life style. When he 
cooks up a robbery that could net $1 million, Jessie is delighted, Vito aghast. 
Still, is it any surprise that they end up pulling off the job as a family? 
</P>
<P>
In his best work, Hoffman has generally sought an edge in the characters he 
plays, some streak of eccentricity. It may come as a relief to see Hoffman 
playing a normal, worn-down guy in "Family Business" after all his 
flibbertigibbet acting tricks in "Rain Man." But the role doesn't inspire him. 
Maybe he felt he had already covered this terrain in the 1978 "Straight Time," 
where he played an ex-con who falls back into crime. That is still probably his 
best performance, and it may have used him up for this kind of material. 
</P>
<P>
Broderick conveys the vast intelligence we keep hearing Adam possesses, but he 
can't make sense of the role. No one could. Adam is supposed to covet a life of 
crime because he finds no excitement in the humdrum law-abiding world. But 
Broderick doesn't look famished for excitement; his alert features, his 
quickness, belie the character's needs. There is also the suggestion here that 
Adam is turning criminal as a way to spite his father and provoke some love, 
but the notion is never developed. Nothing in this film is. 
</P>
<P>
This might be a good time to declare a moratorium on any further over-the-hill 
oldster roles for Sean Connery. It's not that Connery can't play them to the 
hilt. It's just that, at 59, he is such a hale and vigorous presence (hey, he's 
the Sexiest Man Alive cover boy for the current issue of People) that he always 
seems to leave younger actors winded. His dynamism throws "Family Business" 
completely and deservedly out of whack.

PLANNED CBS MOVIE OUTRAGES JAILED MOM; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: OUT OF JAIL, ELIZABETH MORGAN BELIEVES STORY IS BASED ON HER 
CELEBRATED FIGHT TO PREVENT HER EX-HUSBAND FROM SEEING THEIR DAUGHTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In South 1, Cell 37, on a day earlier this year in the District of Columbia 
Detention Center, the celebrated inmate Dr. Elizabeth Morgan received a 
surprise package. A TV script. Unsolicited. She didn't know who sent it. 
</P>
<P>
It was "In the Best Interests of the Child," a grim story about a woman who 
discovers that her ex-husband has been sexually abusing their 5-year-old 
daughter. The judge insists that "Jennifer" permit "Walt" unsupervised visits 
with "Mandy." Jennifer hides the child and goes to jail for contempt. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan was sent to jail for contempt of court in August, 1987, for defying a 
judge and hiding then-5-year-old daughter Hillary from her ex-husband, Dr. Eric 
Foretich, who angrily denied her charges of raping the girl. 
</P>
<P>
How close is the script to her story? 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, now out of jail and interviewed by phone from a friend's house in 
Virginia, said, "Well, first of all, the script that I saw was clearly my story 
for various reasons -- but the obvious one is that a mother goes to jail for 
years and years." 
</P>
<P>
She laughed. "I mean, there's only one person in the history of mankind who's 
done that. I mean, thank heavens (nobody else has gone to jail) -- but that can 
only be me." 
</P>
<P>
And she has sold the rights to her story to another producer, who has not yet 
assigned a writer to the project. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's outrage was re-ignited last week when casting notices circulated among 
Hollywood agents for the CBS production of the "In the Best Interests of the 
Child" script from Papazian-Hirsch Entertainment, with shooting planned to 
start the first week of January. There is no air date yet. 
</P>
<P>
Producer Robert Papazian, in a telephone interview with The Times, said that 
the story is about a woman going into the "underground" to hide from 
authorities, and then "she goes to jail like a lot of other people who have had 
the same problem." 
</P>
<P>
Papazian, who had met with Morgan in jail in late 1988, then said he was being 
interrupted by a long-distance call. An officer in his company called back 
later to say that there would be no further comment. 
</P>
<P>
CBS said through a spokesperson: "There are a lot of stories out there of women 
in very similar situations. And Elizabeth Morgan's is one. But unfortunately 
she's not alone in this whole thing, and they all play themselves out somewhat 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
"The Papazian piece is a compilation and it's not the Elizabeth Morgan story 
and, in fact, we feel that the stories are so different that the network's 
willing to listen to a pitch from those who own the rights, and we wouldn't be 
averse to airing them both." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Otto, the producer whom Morgan settled on to tell her story, said that 
she didn't know how many mothers of sexually abused daughters had gone to jail 
but "there are not 'a lot' of women (who went to jail). . . . And there's only 
one famous woman and it's Elizabeth Morgan. So who are they kidding?" 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, 42, a plastic surgeon, was finally released from jail Sept. 25 after 25 
months via special legislation signed by President Bush. On Dec. 2, she married 
her fiance, Federal Appeals Court Judge Paul Michel, and they are living in the 
Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said that, after a lengthy meeting with Papazian, she didn't feel he was 
"right" to produce her story. Later, she said, he told her agent that CBS had 
given him the go-ahead to make "a generic sexual-abuse story about a mother who 
goes underground." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan quoted Papazian as saying, "Would Dr. Morgan be willing to talk to me 
about her story, not to make a movie about her story, but so I can sort of 
understand what happened in her case just to help, you know, get a grasp on how 
these things play out?" 
</P>
<P>
She met two hours in the jail with the assigned writer early this year "and he 
told me that I was just part of their background research." 
</P>
<P>
Then the script arrived. She was outraged: "It was a travesty of Hillary's 
suffering. It portrayed her father as believable and sympathetic. I thought it 
portrayed her suffering as really minimal. I felt it portrayed her statements 
as partly incredible. I thought it portrayed her relationship with me as poor 
and disturbed. I just thought it was a travesty of the facts about what she 
went through." 
</P>
<P>
The casting announcement indicates that ex-husband Walt might be tougher and 
less sympathetic. Morgan said there did appear to be changes from the script 
she read. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any legal recourse? "It's very hard to know," Morgan said. "Mr. 
Papazian approached me when I was pretty powerless in jail, when I am fighting 
the legal battle of my life to protect my daughter. He couldn't have chosen 
someone less able to protect themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles attorney Shelley Browning, who handles rights negotiations for 
Morgan, said, "I think this leaves a real bad, unsavory taste in everybody's 
mouth, that somebody would do this. Because this is not just another story. 
This is a story that needs to have incredible sensitivity in the telling. 
</P>
<P>
"And there's a real possible and maybe even probable jeopardy to Elizabeth and 
to Hillary by virtue of some sort of a distorted version coming out, a sort of 
homogenized, commercialized version of this story." 
</P>
<P>
Out of more than 500 calls to Morgan's agents and attorneys inquiring about 
film-TV rights, they finally were assigned in October to producer-director 
Otto, a longtime child advocate who had produced the TV movie "Adam," which 
helped instigate federal legislation on behalf of missing children. 
</P>
<P>
With the Papazian-Hirsch project, this would be the second time within a few 
months that her projects were the victims of similarities in CBS movies. Last 
spring she directed "Unspeakable Acts," a docudrama based on a child day care 
scandal in Country Walk, Fla., close in nature to the McMartin Pre-School case. 
In October, CBS aired a fictional drama with a similar plot, "Do You Know the 
Muffin Man?" "Unspeakable Acts" now is scheduled to run on ABC Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Otto said that she was "most upset" about the draft she saw of "In the Best 
Interests of the Child" because it takes a complicated issue and muddles it up 
by oversimplifying and trivializing it: "It made it seem as though you never 
know who's telling the truth. And that's just not true and it's certainly not 
true in this case, in my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
The script was weighted in favor of the father-ex-husband, she said. "You liked 
him. So what it did, it made him the nice guy because she was the accuser. It 
stereotyped the unhappy divorced wife and, although it may not have come right 
out and said it, it implied very strongly that in cases like this, children are 
coached by their mothers to say that their fathers did something to them. It 
perpetuated in its way that myth." 
</P>
<P>
To make this issue appear "unsolvable and unprosecutable . . . is not in the 
best interests of the child or anybody else." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan said that she would like to get back to doctoring "but at the same time 
I feel there are things that I have to do morally, given what I've been through 
-- the legal system and child abuse and the whole problem of the D.C. Jail." 
</P>
<P>
Has she had any contact with Hillary, now 7? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind your asking," she said. "I don't answer though. But I can tell 
you she's OK. She's going to have a happy Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
What did Mom get her for Christmas? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, again, I give you the same answer. Because anything specific about what 
I do makes me nervous."

CLEMONS SEES BUSY FUTURE AT THE END OF THE STREET; 
</P>
<P>
POP: SPRINGSTEEN'S SAXOPHONIST IS NOW FREE TO DO HIS OWN THING BUT HOPES THIS 
ISN'T FINISH OF THE E STREET BAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Clarence Clemons, on the phone from his Marin County home, paused to find the 
right words to describe how he felt when Bruce Springsteen, his boss for nearly 
two decades, called him and said that he wasn't going to need the E Street 
Band, at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a blessing," Clemons said. "And also . . . a hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't what I thought I'd hear. Bruce called me and said that he wanted to 
try something different. He didn't mean that it was the end of the E Street 
Band, but for now we were free to do what we want." 
</P>
<P>
Clemons, who opens a series of Southland dates with his own band tonight at the 
Strand in Redondo Beach, has enjoyed immense visibility as Springsteen's 
saxophonist and sidekick since well before the New Jersey rocker rose to the 
top of the pop world. For much of that time, the Virginia native and former 
counselor for emotionally disturbed and mentally retarded children was 
Springsteen's first lieutenant, symbolized by his sharing the cover of the 
"Born to Run" album in one of the classic rock buddies photos of all time. 
</P>
<P>
"Being together for 18 years, it was a sad thing to see it end," Clemons said. 
"But on the other hand, I'm free now to do my own thing and not worry about 
Bruce saying you have to stop and come back to work. I'm sure this isn't the 
end of the E Street Band, but if it is, I enjoyed it, had a great time with a 
great band, a benchmark in rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
Clemons' part in that was prominent, if not essential. 
</P>
<P>
"I aided in bringing back the saxophone to its rightful place in rock 'n' 
roll," he said proudly. "And all those things that came out with the two of us, 
the image we presented. I look back on that and there's a lot of joy and 
respect." 
</P>
<P>
But the truth is that Clemons' role in the E Street Band had diminished. His 
saxophonic contributions, both on albums and in concert, became more scarce in 
the '80s, and in the 1987 "Tunnel of Love" tour much of his role as 
Springsteen's No. 1 foil had been usurped by singer Patty Scialfa. 
</P>
<P>
"Bruce stopped using saxophone as much as before," Clemons said. "It was just a 
matter of direction and his choice. Of course I wanted to play more, but there 
was no space to play. That's one of the reasons I got my own band and go out 
and play with other people. And maybe that's one of the reasons I moved out 
here to Marin. I saw the handwriting on the wall, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Clemons also took on a number of outside projects in the past several years. 
His new "A Night With Mr. C" album is his third, with a particular emphasis on 
updating the history of rock 'n' roll sax. Among the selections are 
contemporary versions of such sax classics as Jr. Walker's "Shotgun" and Gary 
U.S. Bonds' "Quarter to Three." 
</P>
<P>
"These are some of my favorites," he said. "I wanted to modernize them because 
I wanted the kids today to hear them. They're good songs and I wanted to keep 
the good times alive." 
</P>
<P>
Clemons has also become a regular in Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia's 
side band, and toured recently with Ringo Starr along with Dr. John and Band 
members Levon Helm and Rick Danko. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing with them is like the old days with Bruce -- just a bunch of guys 
playing their hearts out," he said of both outfits. "I guess the E Street Band 
lost a little of that as the years went on. Things became a little more 
refined." 
</P>
<P>
Out of Ringo's band has come an opportunity in another direction Clemons hopes 
to follow more: acting. Helm, an experienced actor, has gotten Clemons and some 
of the others involved in a film now in development about an old Nashville 
R&amp;B band getting back together after 20 years. And Clemons has appeared 
recently on "The Tracy Ullman Show" and "Jake and the Fat Man," and hopes to do 
some stage work in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
"I like playing my natural role as a good guy," he said. "No pimps or drug 
dealers. I guess I should never say never, but I like being myself, the good 
guy, the guy in the white hat."

WEIL USES 'DON GIOVANNI' AS HIS CALLING CARD; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: MOZART'S OPERA HAS BEEN ON THE AGENDA AT ALL TURNING POINTS IN THE 
CONDUCTOR'S CAREER.

For Bruno Weil, "Don Giovanni" has become a good luck charm. 
</P>
<P>
At the 1988 Salzburg Festival, Weil on short notice took over the reins of "Don 
Giovanni" from an ailing Herbert von Karajan, a performance that led to a close 
association with the Austrian maestro until his death in July, and brought Weil 
to the attention of the music world. 
</P>
<P>
"Don Giovanni" was the first opera the young West German conducted in Augsburg, 
where he subsequently was named Generalmusikdirector, a post he held for eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in a series of Mozart programs with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, through 
Sunday, Weil's calling card will be the Overture to "Don Giovanni." 
</P>
<P>
"All deciding points of my career have come to me with this difficult work," 
Weil, 40, said from Vienna. "I hope this (performance) with the Philharmonic 
will be another fortunate thing." 
</P>
<P>
Weil caught the eye of Karajan when conducting Richard Strauss' symphonic poem 
"Don Juan" -- at breakneck speed -- at the finals of the 1979 Herbert von 
Karajan International Conducting Competition in Berlin. Although he placed 
second, Weil was invited to Salzburg to serve as a cover conductor for Karajan. 
Weil was at rehearsals and was able to discuss problems with Karajan. Above 
all, he was able to learn. 
</P>
<P>
"He had such a remarkable sound and I wanted to find out how to make that 
sound," Weil recalled of Karajan. "He did simple things. Over and over again 
he'd tell his orchestra of 30 years (the Berlin Philharmonic) to play longer 
notes and play softer. He told me the secret was never to cease saying the same 
things again and again. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very much influenced by him but I have a different way of looking at the 
music. He came from the German Romantic period and everything is big and slow 
in tempo. I hope to put myself back in the 18th Century and see the music from 
the eyes of the composer in his time." 
</P>
<P>
Although Weil went on to lead a number of concerts with the Berlin 
Philharmonic, it was at Karajan's urgings that Weil sought a provincial post in 
Augsburg, near Munich, where he was able to grow and work on "the whole" 
repertory. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the best advice Karajan could have given me," said Weil, who with his 
wife and two children resides in Augsburg, a city of 250,000. Here, in the city 
where Mozart's father was born, Weil was responsible for opera -- Mozart, 
Verdi, Wagner and Strauss -- as well as all symphonic concerts and ballet given 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Having recently resigned his post at Augsburg, Weil becomes a conducting 
"member" of the Vienna Staatsoper beginning in 1991. Under a new system, no 
more than a dozen conductors will work on specific operas for months at a time. 
This way productions won't change hands so often, said Weil, who expects to 
"polish up" existing Mozart repertory. 
</P>
<P>
At the behest of baritone Hermann Prey, with whom he had worked in Vienna, Weil 
in 1988 made his U.S. debut conducting Schubert's First Symphony at the 
Schubertiade festival at the 92nd Street Y in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Weil has little envy of jet-setting colleagues with high-gear careers. Content 
to "conduct at Bayreuth when 75," he attributes his serenity to Zen Buddhism. 
Weil first embraced the teachings five years ago when, after too many 
performances of Wagner, he began experiencing pain in his back and arms and 
felt the need to release the tension gripping his body. 
</P>
<P>
"Zen Buddhism has taught me more about conducting than anything else. It's 
taught me to relax, and to let the music come from inside and out and down to 
the orchestra and to the audience," said Weil. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I'm happy if things come to me; happy if they don't."

JAZZ NOTES: TURRENTINE JAZZES UP HIS APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tenor saxophonist Stanley Turrentine, who has been a pro going on four decades, 
is another improvising artist who can take or leave the word "Jazz." "It's too 
ambiguous," the Kensington, Md., resident said from a San Francisco tour stop 
Monday. "I always say, 'Ask 50 people what jazz is and you get 50 different 
opinions.' It seems that anything that people don't understand, well, that's 
jazz." 
</P>
<P>
Turrentine -- who plays Birdland West in Long Beach with his quintet through 
Saturday -- says that all the labels people have given him over the years prove 
his point. "It's been said that I'm a blues player, that I play jazz/fusion, 
bebop, rock 'n' roll, con-fusion. I've been through it all," he laughed. 
"Still, I'm playing the same style that I always did, so I try to think in 
terms of music, and just hope the fans like it and keep comin' on in." 
</P>
<P>
Blues, coupled with a capacity for playing long, swinging lines, has always 
been the essential ingredient of the Turrentine approach. "That's a good 
foundation, at least it has been for me," said the former Pittsburgh, Pa. 
native. "I've been into the blues from my first road job, which was with (blues 
guitarist/singer) Lowell Fulsom when I was 16. Ray Charles was the featured 
vocalist and pianist with that group. We'd get on the bandstand and he'd bring 
tears to my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
And while the 55-year-old horn man said that his band members -- Bob Fox, 
keyboards; Dave Stryker, guitar; Scott Ambush, bass, and Ernie Adams, drums -- 
occasionally employ some synthesizers and electric instruments, their use 
hasn't adulterated his presentations. "I surround myself with some of that 
stuff to get that 'today' feel," he said, "but the technology doesn't distort 
my style. I'm still playing acoustically and I don't use any gadgets." 
</P>
<P>
Turrentine said his current repertoire reaches from such early-'70s CTI LPs as 
"Pieces of Dreams" and "Sugar" to his most recent Blue Note effort, "La Place." 
"I play a little bit of the old, a little of the new," he said. "I try to keep 
it to flexible. It seems that a lot of the music I have recorded is still 
valid. At least it's entertaining to me, and I guess entertaining to the people 
who come in." 
</P>
<P>
Briefly hospitalized in October due to an onset of pulmonary edema, Turrentine 
said he's back on his feet and feeling great. "I'm following my doctor's 
orders, sticking to my diet and taking my high blood pressure pills and it's 
like nothing ever happened. I do thank all the people for their cards and 
prayers. They really helped." 
</P>
<P>
Upcoming Turrentine engagements include a slot on the David Letterman show on 
Tuesday, a New Year's Eve date at the World Trade Center in Manhattan and a 
benefit for Enter -- a comprehensive alcohol and drug treatment center located 
in East Harlem -- at the Apollo Theatre on Jan. 27. "It's one of my pet 
projects," he said, adding that such associates as Jimmy Smith, Les McCann, 
Shirley Scott, Hubert Laws, Michael Brecker and Jean Carne are donating their 
services. Angelenos wishing to make donations may write to Enter, 302 E. 111th 
St., New York, N.Y., 10029.

<P>
Eskovitz on the Run 
</P>
<P>
Saxophonist Bruce Eskovitz says one of the biggest drawbacks in the current 
music scene is the difficulty in keeping a band together. That's why he's so 
pleased that his quintet -- which plays at the Overland Cafe in Palms on Friday 
at 8:30 p.m. -- has remained intact for a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys and I -- Stuart Elster, keyboards; David Hart, guitar; Bob Feldman, 
bass, and Rod Harbour, drums -- have been friends for many years and there's 
nothing better than people who like each other playing together, grooving and 
having the audience like it," the CSUN grad said. "I think Paul McCartney said 
that having a band is more fun than driving a Rolls-Royce. Well, I've never had 
a Rolls, but I can tell you, having a band is great." 
</P>
<P>
Eskovitz, who also heads the jazz program at the Crossroads School in Santa 
Monica, covers the gamut of modern moods in his performances. "We do some 
Latin-flavored things, some fusion things and also dip into mainstream, though 
we try to do that with a 1989 approach." 
</P>
<P>
The leader's eponymously-titled debut LP is due out in January on the Los 
Angeles-based ITI label. "It's kind of a jazz/fusion record, but there are 
horns on some tracks, a string section on a ballad, kind of a mixture of some 
happy moods with some that are little darker and deeper. I feel good about it."

COMMISSION ACCEPTS REVISED MURAL PLAN IN LITTLE TOKYO; 
</P>
<P>
ART: THE PROJECT THAT SPARKED COMMUNITY PROTEST STILL REQUIRES APPROVAL OF THE 
CITY REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles' Cultural Affairs Commission voted Thursday to accept a revised 
plan for a politically charged mural by artist Barbara Kruger on a 250-foot 
exterior wall of the Museum of Contemporary Art's Temporary Contemporary in 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also voted to issue a letter supporting the project to the board 
of the Community Redevelopment Agency, which must also approve the plan before 
Kruger and a crew of painters can begin to install it -- perhaps as soon as 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
But the 5-to-1 approval did not diminish the mural project's continuing ability 
to be provocative -- not just on political grounds, but in the context of 
process issues by which public art is coming to be planned and executed in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Kruger project is to be a red, white and blue flag-like mural, 29 feet high 
and 218 feet long. It will nearly cover the entire south-facing wall of the 
Temporary Contemporary -- the building's most public exposure along First 
Street in the heart of Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
MOCA's and the Temporary Contemporary's names will be the focus of the 
blue-and-white section at the mural's top left corner -- suggesting the area of 
the American flag occupied by the stars. The stripes will be made up of red and 
white representations of nine politically charged questions, including "Who is 
beyond the law?" and "Who is free to choose?" 
</P>
<P>
The mural will remain on view for as long as two years after it is completed. 
Since it will face a vacant piece of property that is scheduled for 
development, a new building next to the Temporary Contemporary may obscure the 
wall earlier than two years after completion -- in which case, MOCA officials 
said, the mural will be painted over, 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's vote by the Cultural Affairs Commission was the second time the city 
board had formally approved the work. But the earlier vote was voided after a 
Little Tokyo community group objected to the graphic design originally proposed 
by Kruger in which the Pledge of Allegiance would have dominated the middle of 
the flag design, with the questions surrounding the Pledge. 
</P>
<P>
Some Japanese-Americans objected to being confronted by the Pledge of 
Allegiance -- in letters 6 feet high -- because of massive civil rights 
violations committed by the federal government against people of Japanese 
descent who were placed in World War II internment camps. Alan Sieroty, a 
Cultural Affairs Commission member, noted that the board failed to anticipate 
the emotional reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"We were caught without adequate sensitivity to the lingering pain," Sieroty 
said. "We should not have been so insensitive . . . so ignorant. But we were." 
</P>
<P>
Objections by Little Tokyo residents and leaders precipitated a series of 
community meetings involving Kruger and local residents in which delicate 
negotiations were held over the wording. The process, which Kruger has 
emphasized is representative of an important, evolving component of some public 
art, resulted in elimination of the Pledge of Allegiance wording entirely, but 
retention of the questions. 
</P>
<P>
"These questions should not be whispered," said Kruger of the scale of the 
final version of the piece. The issue, she said, "was how to intervene in a 
public space and this was my resolution." 
</P>
<P>
Adolfo Nodal, general manager of the Cultural Affairs Department, noted that 
the project focuses attention to an evolving perception of public art as 
something that "is ultimately a consensus between two visions" -- that of the 
artist and the community that will be called upon to live with and adjacent to 
the work. 
</P>
<P>
Nodal said the playing off of these two elements may sometimes force public 
officials to become involved in what, in a pure sense, is an artistic decision. 
"It is hard for us -- and potentially dangerous -- to get involved in the 
artistic content," Nodal told the commission before he recommended approval and 
support of the project to the redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
The redevelopment agency's board must approve the work because it may 
technically conflict with some restrictions on billboards and regulations of 
the percentage of space in a billboard or sign that may be occupied by the 
actual wording. Sherri Geldin, the museum's assistant director, said content of 
the Kruger mural had developed added significance as the Little Tokyo debate 
proceeded because of national and international political developments. She 
said importance of the artistic and political freedom of expression implicit in 
the work was emphasized by the summerlong debate in Congress over the 
appropriateness of federal support of controversial artworks.

IT'S A SOUTHWESTERN CHRISTMAS TRADITION DEEPLY ROOTED IN CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WYMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Humor and action are not the hallmarks of most holiday theater fare, but in 
"Una Pastorela," opening Wednesday at San Fernando Mission for a four-day run, 
that's precisely what the audience can expect. 
</P>
<P>
It is the story of shepherds traveling to Bethlehem to worship the newborn 
Jesus, but they have a heck of a time getting there. Along the way are demons 
to contend with -- the Seven Deadly Sins dressed in football jerseys with their 
names on the back. If it weren't for a group of sword-wielding angels, the 
shepherds might never arrive. 
</P>
<P>
But arrive they do, as they have in Pastorelas for hundreds of years. The plays 
are a Christmas tradition in the Southwest and Mexico. Individual towns revised 
the story over the years until each pastorela has a character of its own. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the tradition is that you change it," said Director Francisco 
Gonzalez, who revived Santa Barbara's pastorela in 1986 and, with the UCLA 
Mexican Arts Series, is bringing it to San Fernando Mission. Gonzalez, a 
musician, was one of the founders of Los Lobos and stayed with the group from 
1973 to 1976. He now teaches Chicano theater at Santa Barbara City College. 
</P>
<P>
Pastorela means shepherd's play. Working from a script in the archives of Santa 
Barbara Mission, Gonzalez wrote music to accompany the play's rhymed Spanish 
lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
"The original music is lost, of course," he said. "Even having a script is kind 
of odd. This is an oral tradition. The people would start learning it in July 
and be able to do it by Christmas. They would learn it from someone who had the 
part before." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez added English phrases and says people unfamiliar with Spanish will 
have no trouble following the story. He expects a cast of about 30. The actors 
are unpaid. 
</P>
<P>
"People from all parts of the Santa Barbara community are in it," he said. 
"It's fun, it has the spirit of simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, it's very important to continue this tradition. Our other Christmas 
traditions aren't local. The 'Nutcracker' is Russian. Christmas carols are from 
Europe. We have a tendency to be colonized up to this day. But this play is 
something that evolved in California." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hutchinson, associate dean of the UCLA College of Fine Arts, said the 
school's Mexican Art Series had hoped to present a pastorela indigenous to Los 
Angeles this holiday season but could not put together a production in time. 
Discussions are under way with the Los Angeles Theatre Center for a local 
production next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not quite ready, so it's wonderful that we could bring in the Santa 
Barbara group," Hutchinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Una Pastorela" has been performed the past four years in Santa Barbara's El 
Presidio Chapel. With its costumes, live musicians and horseback battles (done 
on imitation horses), the production is more lavish than most. 
</P>
<P>
"This tradition is very low-profile," Gonzalez said. "People did it in their 
homes or they'd do it in church, but not as a big spectacle. It's still done 
today. Each region in Mexico has a different version. There are different 
versions all over New Mexico and in Texas." 
</P>
<P>
Following the local performances, a pinata will be set up for children in the 
audience to break. 
</P>
<P>
"The devils come out and run the pinata," said Gonzalez. "The kids love it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Una Pastorela," 6 and 8:30 p.m. Wednesday through Dec. 23; San Fernando 
Mission Chapel, 15151 San Fernando Mission Road, Mission Hills; admission $15, 
$8 for students and children. For information, call (213) 825-2953.

DARK, SAVAGE SIDE EMERGES IN NEW 'HENRY V'; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: YOUNG BRITISH ACTOR-DIRECTOR KENNETH BRANAGH'S SKILL AND PASSION EQUAL 
HIS DARING IN TAKING ON LAURENCE OLIVIER'S 1944 TRIPLE FEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Heroism is something the movies have often cheapened; verbal poetry and 
rhetoric they often ignore altogether. Yet -- seemingly on fire with all three 
-- the young British actor-director Kenneth Branagh has brought them, in 
blazing measures, to his adaptation of William Shakespeare's "Henry V" (opening 
at the Park Theatre in San Diego). 
</P>
<P>
At first, it seems a madly audacious endeavor. Branagh -- trying to match 
Laurence Olivier's astonishing triple feat of adapting, directing and starring 
in a filmed "Henry" -- butts heads with an inarguably great movie and the 
champion British classical actor of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, his skill and passion equal his daring. This thrilling new version of the 
play complements rather than challenges Olivier's. If Olivier gave us the glint 
of sunlight on armor and the wind roaring through the pennants and flags, 
Branagh gives us the rot, the mold, the wounds and the crusted blood 
underneath. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier, in a conceit dazzling in its wittiness and prettiness, staged "Henry" 
in a mock-up of the Globe Theater and sets skewed to the style of Renaissance 
Flemish or Dutch paintings. Branagh's sets are the vast, empty castles of movie 
epics or horror shows, and his battlefields are plateaus of mud and gore under 
gray, bristling skies, where men die foully. If Olivier gave us the ultimate 
poet-warrior king, Branagh gives us a blunt but brave boy, a sawed-off, 
sandy-haired runt, passing through fire and chaos to manhood. This is a dark, 
savage "Henry" -- post-Marx, post-Brecht, post-"Paths of Glory," post-Vietnam 
-- in which the heroism is undercut with bloodshed and in which the Chorus 
(Derek Jacobi) glides, at first, through a movie sound stage, all in black, his 
voice scarringly urbane. 
</P>
<P>
Death is stripped of every scrap of nobility. Both sides, British and French, 
are equally full of heroism and cowardice, sadism and self-sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
In place of Olivier's great showpiece scene -- the equestrian French army 
charging jubilantly right to left in a burst of stallion exhilaration -- 
Branagh gives us a "Chimes of Midnight"-like battle of stabbings and clouts in 
the mud, capped by a somber, dazzling Wellesian tracking shot on Henry, as he 
carries the corpse of Falstaff's Boy across a somber, reeking wasteland of 
broken bodies. Branagh, only 28 -- about Henry's age at Agincourt, and almost a 
decade younger than Olivier when he made his 1944 version -- is a current 
Wunderkind of British theater. And his versatility in his only two movie parts, 
"High Season" and "A Month in the Country," was shocking, as if the same actor 
could master roles meant for either Monty Python or Montgomery Clift. 
</P>
<P>
In playing Henry V, he's taking one of the great glamour roles in Shakespeare. 
Yet he deglamorizes it, ripening steadily through the forge of warfare until 
the burst of fiery rhetoric on his great "St. Crispin's" speech. 
</P>
<P>
"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers," keens the erstwhile Prince Hal, 
his face shining in the gloom, to his mud-encrusted, outmanned army and, like 
Churchill's surging wartime oratory during the Blitz, this speech makes the 
blood run hot, the sinews quiver. That's the force of Branagh's conception. 
Olivier, working in wartime to arouse national spirit, gave us a hero who 
surpassed understanding. Branagh roots his in the loam of common character. 
</P>
<P>
The movie is about a different kind of heroism as well: the heroism of the 
theatrical ensemble. Paul Scofield is an uncharacteristically sage King Charles 
VI; Ian Holm a dour Fluellen; Robert Stephens a scabrous, cowardly thick 
Pistol; Charles Kay and Alec McCowen two magnificently conspiratorial church 
prelates; Emma Thompson a notably non-featherbrained Katherine (playing a 
deliciously wry courting scene with her husband, Branagh); Robbie Coltrane (in 
flashback scenes borrowed from the "Henry IV" plays) a sad, blubbery dying 
Falstaff, and Judi Dench a definitively funny Mistress Quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The British won at Agincourt because of superior technology. The expert Welsh 
archers mowed the French cavalry down. But in Shakespeare's world, they also 
won because of gorgeous poetry and heart-stirring eloquence. Branagh's expertly 
cut and reshaped "Henry V" (Times-rated Mature for violence) gives us the grimy 
face of war, yet he also gives us the guts -- and the soul and poetry that 
animate them both. Egoist and daring scamp Branagh may well be, but so, in 
ways, were Olivier and Welles. It's a pleasure to welcome this young lion and 
his company's splendid "Henry" to their ranks.

The cow dreams of being a giraffe. The chicken dreams of being a rhinoceros. 
The horse dreams of being a wild boar. 
</P>
<P>
And "Animal Nation," a world premiere at the San Diego Repertory Theatre, may 
dream of being a play. Desperately. Earnestly. But, alas, unsuccessfully. 
</P>
<P>
"Animal Nation," the final offering of the Rep's premiere-laden season 
(presented in collaboration with the Dell'Arte Players Company), is as 
well-intentioned and beautifully designed and performed as most of the 
theater's 1989 shows. And just as muddled. 
</P>
<P>
Just what is Steve Friedman's script about? That's a good question that Jael 
Weisman's and Sam Woodhouse's co-direction fails to answer. 
</P>
<P>
At first it seems to be an animal rights play in which two pigs, a chicken, a 
cow, a sheep, a stud horse, a Doberman and a new seven-way DNA-splice animal, 
called a Webelo, escape from an animal laboratory called BioTech Farms, in 
which they have been tortured and tested to the extreme. 
</P>
<P>
Then it veers into a False Messiah tale as the animals, who have chosen the 
Webelo as the creature to lead them out of the darkness, are ultimately 
betrayed by him and by the DNA tampering process that made him. 
</P>
<P>
In a complicated marriage scene, suggestive of nuns and priests marrying Jesus 
and the church, the animals hook up electrically to the dying Webelo, hoping to 
pull part of what they worship into themselves. But at the moment the charge 
passes into their bodies, the Christ figure becomes an anti-Christ -- actually 
a giant rat -- passing on some kind of grand lobotomy rather than liberation. 
</P>
<P>
And then we're into "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" or "One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo's Nest" in which one lone pig, who escapes the operation, runs off only 
to try, unsuccessfully, to talk the other lobotomized pig into joining her. 
</P>
<P>
"Could you make it simpler?" asks the horse at one point. Ah, there's a note 
</P>
<P>
somebody should have slipped to the writer. 
</P>
<P>
Sad to say that nothing can save this show from the whirlpool of its own 
confusion, not an excellent acting ensemble or Gina Leishman's attractive, 
quirky score or Victoria Petrovich's handsome set design that transforms the 
claustrophobic lab into an airy meadow in a matter of moments. 
</P>
<P>
The actors are aided immeasurably by Nancy Jo Smith's costumes and Rob Watson's 
masks and makeup in their uncanny animal impressions. Bernard Baldan is 
exceptionally fine, prancing on his high-hoof shoes as the horse; author 
Friedman and Joan Schirle do a wonderful waddle in the mud as the pigs; both 
Regina Byrd Smith as a vulnerable sheep and Tracy Hughes as a funky chicken add 
lovely singing voices to the mix, and Joe Dieffenbacher does a delicious bit as 
the smarmy Doberman that no one wants to pair with. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Forrest is compelling as the Webelo -- but neither he nor Friedman nor 
Weisman nor Woodhouse ever seem to figure out what motivates the Webelo to do 
any of the peculiar things it does. Maybe that's OK if you're Iago, but this 
script isn't Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Webelo, the story is so lost in the thicket of its ideology -- whether 
it's pro-animal or anti-science or social/religious allegory or whatever -- 
that it commits the cardinal dramatic sin of never delving into 
characterizations. George Orwell, the social critic who wrote "Animal Farm," 
one of this play's initial inspirations, knew how to make you care for the 
faithful workhorse and fear the conniving pig. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody is knocking animal rights, but what about audience rights? Maybe it is 
too much to expect a play that is comprehensible, but a play about animals that 
doesn't even touch the heart? This is an unviable dramatic mutation. 
</P>

A paved high road curves through manicured landscaping to a sprawling ranch 
house. The low road is dirt, and there are no homes in sight. The high road 
serves the upper-middle-class residents of Rancho Bernardo; the low road is a 
dusty path an immigrant laborer takes to bring drinkable water to his 
encampment. 
</P>
<P>
He and the unseen homeowner are neighbors, uneasily coexisting in an atmosphere 
of fear, desperation, denial and deeply ingrained prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
Don Bartletti's photograph "High Road/Low Road" is part of an eye-opening 
photo-documentation of life at the Mexico-U.S. border, commissioned by the 
Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego and supported by the Los Angeles 
Times, San Diego Edition and the Times Mirror Foundation. On view at the museum 
through Jan. 7, "Los Vecinos" (The Neighbors) consists of images made by four 
American and three Mexican photographers, as well as documentary videos by two 
San Diegans. 
</P>
<P>
Subjects are diverse: the rituals of Hispanic gang members, tactics of the U.S. 
Border Patrol, small moments in immigrant workers' daily lives, street children 
and the tourist trade in Tijuana. The photographers' approaches are intensely 
personal. And the social crisis of Us and Them has never seemed more disturbing 
and despairing of remedy. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone familiar with images of migrant workers in the Dust Bowl taken by the 
Farm Security Administration photographers will observe that documentary 
photography has changed a great deal since the 1930s, when the best work 
aspired to the ennobled, exalted status of Renaissance painting. 
</P>
<P>
A good number of the photographs in "Los Vecinos" are in the blurred or 
random-seeming "snapshot" style that has been the fashion for the past couple 
of decades. Scattered, dimly lit images give the flavor of life on the run and 
the scrounging life of the streets. The more judgmental images tend to be more 
rigorously composed, more "journalistic," more able to convey the bones of a 
narrative. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Meiselas, known for her reportorial photographs of Nicaragua and El 
Salvador, chose to focus on what one member of the Border Patrol calls "the 
ultimate game hunt." In one of her images, a beefy guard with a holster holds a 
suspected illegal immigrant by the back of his shirt. Meiselas slices their 
heads off the top of the print, stripping off both their personalities to zero 
in on the symbolism of hunter and hunted. 
</P>
<P>
Liliana Nieto del Rio, a staff photographer for New York Newsday, looks at the 
hard-bitten, scruffy bits of everyday life in camps on the banks of the Tijuana 
River. Carpet scraps, comic books, cigarette packets and dirt, endless dirt, 
are the interior decoration of this environment. 
</P>
<P>
For amusement, a young boy aims a BB gun at U.S. border guards who are small 
specks in the distance. A street kid in Tijuana makes goofy faces inside an 
abandoned car; others gather in bare rooms to sniff paint thinner or glue. 
</P>
<P>
Antonio Turok, a self-taught magazine photographer in Mexico, offers a 
kaleidoscope of views of the refugee camp life in Mexico. A child's skin hangs 
in frightening folds from her legs. A tearful group of men and boys (where are 
the women?) grieve at the fringes of a child's coffin. A barefoot man in a suit 
lifts his hat to a covey of middle-class schoolgirls in parochial school 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
Pablo Ortiz Monasterio, an award-winning Mexican photographer, locates small, 
mostly upbeat, moments in immigrant life: the bed as a central gathering place 
in a household that may not own any other furniture, the spic-and-span white 
dresses of young girls, children's hands laboring over a crayon drawing of a 
religious shrine. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Sisco has devoted her career to photographing life at the border. Her 
installation contains cheery color photographs of Tijuana vendors, shelves of 
their cheap wares, black-and-white 
</P>
<P>
candid shots of strolling tourists -- and a sampling of their devastatingly 
insular and callous remarks. ("They are not the people I'd like to see 
everyday," sniffs one visitor.) 
</P>
<P>
Bartletti, a Los Angeles Times photographer, is a succinct storyteller alert to 
the meaningfulness of detail. A row of Guatemalan refugees wrapped in blankets 
sleep above a freeway ribboned with bright car lights. Other Guatemalans -- one 
carrying a native embroidered bag, another holding a plastic sack -- stride 
through a field at dawn, rushing to street corners miles away where they hope 
to be hired as day-laborers. 
</P>
<P>
Graciela Iturbide, a disciple of the great Mexican photographer Manuel Alvarez 
Bravo, offers images of young barrio society in East Los Angeles: the hand 
signals, the stylized modes of dress, the tattooed and painted decorations 
found on bare skin, religious murals and car hoods. 
</P>
<P>
A young woman sitting wistfully in the back seat of a car with her baby is made 
up like a movie goddess, her painstaking self-adornment radiating a vibrancy 
and sensuality that floats above the decay of her surroundings. There is no 
violence in Iturbide's photographs, only bravado and sadness. 
</P>
<P>
There was insufficient time on one visit to absorb some six hours of videotapes 
by Paul Espinosa, a senior producer at KPBS-TV, and Louis Hock, a professor in 
the UC San Diego visual arts department. But Hock's "Mexican Tapes: A Chronicle 
of Life Outside the Law," offers a disarmingly low-key introduction to three 
families of undocumented Mexicans he came to know as neighbors and followed 
through five years of wonder, dismay and wariness as they learned about life on 
the other side of the border.

DODGERS MAY GET LEFT OUT; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: TUDOR SIGNS ONE-YEAR CONTRACT WITH THE CARDINALS. MEANWHILE, THE A'S 
TALK WITH VALENZUELA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Amid an off-season that is looking strangely like last summer, the Dodgers lost 
free agent pitcher John Tudor Thursday and could be losing free agent pitcher 
Fernando Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
Tudor, deciding he needed to pitch more than three times a month as he did in 
September, turned down a competitive Dodger offer and signed a one-year deal 
with the St. Louis Cardinals. At the same time, sources said Valenzuela is 
within days of signing with another team, the leading candidate being the 
Oakland Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we have talked to Valenzuela," an Oakland source confirmed. "There won't 
be anything tomorrow, but I can't say about two or three days from now." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger sources say Valenzuela was heavily wooed by the New York Yankees last 
weekend, but, contrary to media speculation, the Yankees dropped from the 
picture earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday, Yankee Vice President George Bradley said, "The 
Yankees have never been interested in Valenzuela nor have we had any 
conversations with Fernando or his agent." 
</P>
<P>
Oakland appears a likely choice because the A's were one of the finalists in 
the Tudor sweepstakes, and are in need of a solid left-hander to join Dave 
Stewart, Mike Moore and Bob Welch in the defending world champions' rotation. 
They are hurting from the loss of right-hander Storm Davis, who recently took 
his 31 starts to Kansas City, although they did sign right-hander Scott 
Sanderson Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an improved Dodger offer last week, the Dodgers and their former Cy 
Young Award winner remain far apart. They have offered Valenzuela a two-year 
deal of about $1.7 million per year, a pay cut from Valenzuela's $1.85-million 
salary of last season. That offer is about $3 million less than Valenzuela's 
demand of three years at nearly $6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers have also offered Valenzuela arbitration, which he must accept by 
next Tuesday. But Valenzuela's lawyer, Dick Moss, implied he would not accept 
that offer, meaning if the club can't sign him by Jan. 8, he cannot re-sign 
with the Dodgers until May 1. 
</P>
<P>
Moss and Valenzuela's agent, Tony DeMarco, refused comment Thursday, but 
earlier this week Moss dropped hints. 
</P>
<P>
"The Dodgers have been trying to create a climate where it's all set up for 
Fernando to sign," Moss said. "That is not true, and if there's any further 
doubt about that, we could erase it on Dec. 19." 
</P>
<P>
Moss added: "People should realize the seriousness of what is happening here. 
The Dodgers have offered to substantially cut Fernando's salary for two years. 
That's not a good way to treat him." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Executive Vice President Fred Claire, currently in Hawaii combining 
business with a rare vacation, would not comment on reports of Valenzuela's 
imminent departure. 
</P>
<P>
"I recognize the situation as it is," Claire said. "Fernando is out there for 
all teams to approach. The only thing I will say is, we still have an interest, 
and we've expressed that interest." 
</P>
<P>
Their interest in Tudor apparently came too late. Tudor, who was acquired by 
the Dodgers from St. Louis for Pedro Guerrero on Aug. 17, 1988, signed a 
one-year deal with his former team for a guaranteed $350,000 plus around 
$900,000 in incentives based upon the condition of his bothersome left 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Claire confirmed that the Dodgers recently made a similar offer. But sources 
say Tudor turned it down because, after he was activated Sept. 2, he only made 
three relief appearances the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"John signed with the Cardinals because of his level of comfort with Whitey 
(Manager Herzog) and (pitching coach Mike) Roarke," Tudor's agent, Steve 
Freyer, said. "He doesn't want this interpreted as a slam to the Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
But, Freyer admitted, "had John been able to pitch in September, it would have 
been most beneficial to John and the Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Tudor's loss turns the Guerrero trade into a Dodger black eye depends 
on what statistics you read. Guerrero had an MVP-type season for the Cardinals 
last summer, batting .311 with 117 runs batted in, but Tudor had helped the 
Dodgers to their 1988 World Series championship by going 4-3 with a 2.41 
earned-run average in nine starts. He departed Game 3 of the 1988 World Series 
against Oakland after just 1 1/3 innings with a bad shoulder, and did not pitch 
for the Dodgers again until last June 27. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger interest in Tudor waned after he went back on the disabled list July 8, 
and when he was ready to attempt another comeback in September, the Dodgers 
weren't ready for him. At one point during September, he even asked the team 
for his release, and was refused. He finished the year 0-0 with a 3.14 ERA in 
14 1/3 innings. When he turned down the Dodgers' offer to pitch in the Arizona 
Instructional League after the season, it was assumed he would not rejoin the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
But as the Valenzuela negotiations broke down, the Tudor talks heated up, and 
he was even offered arbitration to stay with the club. 
</P>
<P>
"The Dodgers made every effort to sign him," Freyer said. "We had very good 
conversations. They tried. This was not a slam dunk for the Cardinals by any 
means. 
</P>
<P>
"But John just has a strong, strong relationship with St. Louis." 
</P>
<P>
Said Claire: "We certainly gave John every consideration as far as 
opportunities and support are concerned. We took every step to get him back."

NATIONS THE SAME, BUT ROLES CHANGED IN DAVIS CUP FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
It was snowing last weekend in Vaxjo, Sweden, where Stefan Edberg stopped to 
practice; and it was raining in Stuttgart, West Germany, when he got there this 
week. Storms, lightning and thunder? As usual, they accompany an introduction 
to Boris Becker. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most prestigious events in tennis begins today in Becker's back 
yard, where, in perhaps this sport's ultimate twist, money is not the object. 
No, nationalism is at stake this weekend, the bragging rights of not just 
Europe, but the world of tennis. 
</P>
<P>
The Davis Cup, a competition that began in 1900, will be either taken away by 
challenger Sweden or retained by defending champion West Germany in a rematch 
of last year's final at Goteborg, where then-challenger West Germany took the 
title held by defending champion Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was it a classic case of role reversal, it was also classic tennis. 
</P>
<P>
There was Mats Wilander, the No. 1 player in the world, taking the first two 
sets from Carl-Uwe Steeb but ultimately losing the match. There was Edberg cut 
out like a Christmas cookie by Becker. Finally, there was the vaunted Swedish 
doubles team of Edberg and Anders Jarryd winning the first two sets, only to 
fall in five sets to Becker and Eric Jelen. 
</P>
<P>
The title clinched at 3-0, West Germany closed it out, 4-1, for its first Davis 
Cup championship. Becker, a three-time Wimbledon champion and the U.S. Open 
champion, put West Germany's Davis Cup victory into perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"To win the Davis Cup is the all-time highlight of my career," Becker said. "We 
won it, 3-0, on the second day against Sweden on clay in their home court." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Sweden has the chance to do the same thing to West Germany. While working 
out in Vaxjo, Edberg considered the similarities between this year and last. He 
had chosen Vaxjo because there was one court in the city that had the same kind 
of indoor carpet, called Pegulan, that will be used in the final. 
</P>
<P>
His head cold was gone, the one that bothered Edberg during the week he was in 
New York, where he won the Nabisco Masters tournament. But the kind of 
suffocating pressure that can grip your nerve endings, travel up your arms and 
paralyze your racket, well, they're still going to be around. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the decade, the Swedes have lived in the Davis Cup final. This is 
Sweden's seventh consecutive appearance, with three victories. It should also 
be noted that the holder of the Davis Cup has failed to keep it each of the 
last three years. If all this indicates that this is Sweden's year, well, it 
probably depends on Becker, the principal West German. 
</P>
<P>
His best year on the Grand Prix circuit having been concluded with two Grand 
Slam victories, Becker can finish in even grander style by successfully 
defending his country's Davis Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
Like everyone else, Edberg is wary of Becker. 
</P>
<P>
"Becker is the German team," Edberg said simply. "He really is. Of course, we 
cannot forget Steeb, who is a very good player as well." 
</P>
<P>
This would be sound advice. When the United States played West Germany in July, 
Andre Agassi called matches against Steeb "a gimme," then promptly went out and 
lost to him. Steeb is ranked No. 15 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Swedes will use Edberg and probably Wilander against Becker and Steeb, 
while Edberg and Jarryd are likely to play doubles against Becker and Jelen. 
Becker's 13-3 record against top-10 players was the best in Grand Prix 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
There is a chance the doubles match may decide the final, but only if there is 
consistency from Wilander, Sweden's biggest variable. Wilander sank like a 
stone in the rankings in 1989, plunging from No. 1 to No. 12, and was 0-3 
against opponents in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a little bit uncertain how Mats is going to perform," Edberg 
said. "I mean, he's very eagerly practicing now, which is a good sign, but it's 
totally different when they call time and you play a match." 
</P>
<P>
To get to the final, Sweden defeated Italy, 4-1; Austria, 3-2, and Yugoslavia, 
4-1. West Germany made it by beating Indonesia, 5-0; Czechoslovakia, 3-2, and 
the United States, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
Just reaching the final has been something of a tradition for Sweden, which has 
been the runner-up 14 times. Edberg said this weekend's final in Stuttgart will 
be followed closely by his countrymen. And why not? 
</P>
<P>
"The Davis Cup has meant a lot to me and, of course, to the Swedish people, who 
have been taking a lot of interest in the Davis Cup because . . . we have done 
so well in the past," Edberg said. "There is a lot of tradition; it takes us a 
long way back. It's one of the greatest things in tennis. You've got the four 
Grand Slams, you've got Davis Cup. And it's really, really big in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, West Germany, they are favorites coming in, but it is a little bit around 
to what it was last year because we were slightly the favorites, playing at 
home," he said. "But I guess we're in their position. We feel like we've got 
nothing to lose. Hopefully, we can take the title back to Sweden."

SMITH: USC IS VILLAIN AGAINST BO, MICHIGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Some guys will do anything to win a ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
That was USC Coach Larry Smith's good-natured response to the retirement 
announcement by Michigan's Bo Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, an assistant under Schembechler at both Michigan and Miami of Ohio and 
close to him ever since, already has lost one Rose Bowl game to his former 
mentor, a 22-14 setback last January. Now, Schembechler has a built-in 
emotional advantage in his Pasadena rematch with USC. 
</P>
<P>
You know, win one for the old coach in his last game. 
</P>
<P>
Smith didn't discount that aspect Thursday when he said: "I don't think there's 
any question that there will be a lot more media attention for Bo's last game. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about one of the great college football coaches in the country. 
There's no doubt in my mind that Michigan will be a little extra emotionally 
charged for the game and it provides an incentive and a challenge for us." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said Schembechler's announcement came as somewhat of a surprise, but he 
liked the way his friend bowed out. 
</P>
<P>
"He made his own decision," Smith said. "Bo did it his way." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler has not won a national championship in his 27 years as a head 
coach, and even though his team is ranked No. 3 nationally, it doesn't figure 
that Michigan could climb to No. 1 even by beating USC. 
</P>
<P>
That assessment was made before Schembechler said the Rose Bowl would be his 
final game as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that if Michigan beats USC and No. 1-ranked Colorado loses to Notre 
Dame, there is a possibility that coaches and writers would vote Michigan No. 1 
as a sentimental gesture to Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler is 2-7 in the Rose Bowl, and Smith is 0-2, having lost in 
successive years to Michigan State and Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the pressure builds with each defeat, Smith said: "I don't think it's 
the pressure. You keep searching until you find a way. I just try to find a 
better way of doing things, or correcting your mistakes that caused you to 
lose, or whatever it may be. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, it's inevitable. It's like the film of Rocky. You get knocked down enough 
times, you just find a way to win the championship." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, of course, will be primed to deprive Schembechler, who has 234 
victories, of his last win. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a bittersweet type of thing," Smith said. "This is one time we're 
going to be wearing the black hat no matter what. And he's going to be wearing 
the white hat. We're the villains in this one." 
</P>
<P>
Asked to recall a Schembechler story, Smith didn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the first day I was hired as an assistant coach at Michigan along with 
some other guys. We drove to Ann Arbor, Mich., in the middle of December and 
checked into a hotel. It was snowing, and we were told to be in the office at 7 
o'clock in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo never told us how to get there. He just said to be there. So, with the 
weather, we were slipping and sliding with our cars all over the place trying 
to get there. 
</P>
<P>
"We got there five minutes early. And there was Bo, all stretched out and 
relaxed, and he asked, 'Where have you been?' He'd expected us to be there 20 
minutes early." 
</P>
<P>
Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC began practice Thursday on campus but will work out at UC Irvine Dec. 
27-30. . . . Outside linebacker Junior Seau, who suffered a mild right shoulder 
separation against UCLA, is ready to practice, but his contact work may be 
limited. . . . The Trojans are well-represented on The Sporting News 
All-America first team, with Seau and defensive back Mark Carrier. UCLA punter 
Kirk Maggio also is on the team. . . . Wide receiver John Jackson has been 
named an NCAA Today's Top 6 award winner for scholastic achievement. Jackson 
carries a 3.30 grade-point average while working on a graduate degree in 
business . . . Coach Larry Smith said offensive tackle Pat Harlow has a back 
problem and is questionable for the Rose Bowl game. If he can't play, he'll be 
replaced by 6-foot-7, 290-pound Michael Moody. Smith's analysis of the 
Wolverines: "They don't beat themselves." . . . USC strong safety Mark Carrier 
is a finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award, given to the nation's best defensive 
back. . . . Omen? Smith is only the second coach in history to get to the Rose 
Bowl in his first three seasons at a school. Stanford's Tiny Thornhill 
(1933-35) was the other. Like Smith, he lost his first two Rose Bowl games but 
won the third.

TV-RADIO: SEVERINO &amp; PRIME: A WINNING TICKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Bill Daniels hired John Severino to head his Prime Ticket network a little 
more than a year ago, there were some doubters. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Severino was once the president of the ABC-TV network and served two 
different stints as the general manager of KABC-TV, but what did he know about 
cable television? 
</P>
<P>
When Severino was at KABC, some people said he was controversial. Others were 
less kind. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years ago, he got into trouble with the Nielsen rating service when 
he had KABC do a feature on Nielsen families -- the ones who determine ratings 
-- in an obvious ploy to get those families to watch his station and 
artificially drive up its ratings. 
</P>
<P>
What shenanigans would he pull now? Would he turn Prime Ticket into another 
Eyewitless News, which is what critics have called KABC's Eyewitness News? 
</P>
<P>
But Severino appears to be on his best behavior these days. 
</P>
<P>
He joined Prime Ticket on Columbus Day 1988. He hasn't exactly discovered any 
new frontiers, but things are happening at Prime Ticket, mostly for the better. 
</P>
<P>
When Prime Ticket was launched in October 1985, it had 680,000 cable 
subscribers, and its subscriber base was 2.9 million when Severino came aboard. 
</P>
<P>
It now has nearly 4 million and, in just over four years, has become the 
largest of the nation's 32 regional sports networks. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket has even surpassed the 20-year-old Madison Square Garden network, 
which has 3.4 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels gives some credit for Prime Ticket's growth to former president Tony 
Acone, who is still with the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony's area of expertise is in working with affiliates," Daniels said. "What 
we needed was someone who could build sales and someone who also knows the 
politics involved in the local market. Sev supplied that missing ingredient. 
</P>
<P>
"It cost me a lot of money to get him, but it's been worth it." 
</P>
<P>
Severino's salary reportedly is in the $500,000-a-year range, hefty for cable 
television, and he also owns a percentage of the company -- eventually 5%. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Buss, formerly an equal partner, owns 15%, with Daniels holding the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Sports is not something new for Severino. He was a lineman on the football team 
at Connecticut, then a graduate assistant coach at the university and later the 
coach of a semipro team in Portland, Me. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the team also owned the town's TV station, and during the 
off-season Severino sold ads for the station. 
</P>
<P>
"I've come full circle," Severino said before speaking at a morning panel 
session of the Western Cable Television Convention in Anaheim Thursday. "I got 
into television because of sports, and now, because of television, I'm back in 
sports." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1987-88 season, Prime Ticket televised 350 sports events. 
</P>
<P>
Under Severino, in 1988-89, the company televised 600 sports events, as well as 
numerous preview, review and magazine shows. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Your Call," with Bill MacDonald, is a good example of the well-produced 
shows Prime Ticket now offers. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm having the time of my life," Severino said. "Nothing I've ever done in 
television has been this much fun, this rewarding. When I was at ABC, it was a 
big corporation. If you wanted to get something done, it took corporate 
approval. Here we just do it." 
</P>
<P>
Severino, besides signing longtime USC announcer Tom Kelly to an exclusive 
contract, hired key people away from KABC, including program director Don 
Corsini, engineering expert Bob Bellici and ad man Mike Kincaid. 
</P>
<P>
When Severino started at Prime Ticket, there was no sales department. The job 
of selling commercials was handled by an outside firm. 
</P>
<P>
In the pre-Severino era, 75% of Prime Ticket's revenue came from subscribers, 
25% from commercials. It's now closer to 50-50, and Severino said he hopes -- 
and this may be just wishful thinking -- that the breakdown eventually will be 
75% from commercials, 25% from subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket's biggest expense is rights fees. The company pays out $6.2 
million a year, with the Lakers getting nearly $3 million and the Kings more 
than $2 million. Most of the rest goes to the Pacific 10 Conference, USC and 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
The company has yet to show an annual profit. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be showing a profit by the end of 1990," Severino said. 
</P>
<P>
Severino's immediate goals were to: (1) increase sales, (2) improve graphics 
and the overall look of production and (3) improve programming. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to look like a major network," Severino said, "and I think we've 
accomplished that." 
</P>
<P>
Severino has also responded to complaints from viewers. For example, according 
to Severino, there will be no more 10 p.m. start times for King telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a few of those left on the schedule, but we killed them," he said. 
"No hockey telecasts will begin later than 6:30 or 7." 
</P>
<P>
The worst thing about those 10 p.m. starts was that some cable companies cut 
off their Prime Ticket channel at midnight and switched over to a shopping 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
But those snafus should disappear since, beginning Jan. 1, Prime Ticket will 
expand its programming to a nightly signoff of 2:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Among Prime Ticket's plans for 1990 are news programs at 6 and 11 p.m., 
probably starting in September. 
</P>
<P>
As for this year, Severino said Prime Ticket will televise a USC-UCLA football 
marathon on Christmas Day, 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Nothing but USC-UCLA football 
games for 12 consecutive hours. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the future, Severino said the one thing Prime Ticket is missing is 
baseball, but about the only way it could lure the Dodgers and Angels away from 
Sports Channel would be to start a separate pay channel. He said that's a 
possibility down the road. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
There will be five NFL games televised in Los Angeles this weekend, beginning 
Saturday at 9:30 a.m. with Dallas at the New York Giants on CBS, with Verne 
Lundquist and Terry Bradshaw reporting. At 1 p.m. on NBC it will be Denver at 
Phoenix, with Marv Albert and Bob Trumpy calling the action. The Sunday lineup: 
Minnesota at Cleveland on CBS at 10 a.m., with Dick Stockton and Dan Fouts; 
Buffalo at San Francisco on NBC at 1 p.m., with Dick Enberg and Bill Walsh, and 
the Raiders at Seattle on ESPN and Channel 11 at 5 p.m., with Mike Patrick and 
Joe Theismann. 
</P>
<P>
According to pay-view distributor Rick Kulis, the Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto 
Duran fight grossed $75 million nationally, including $5.5 million locally -- 
topping the $55 million and $5.2 million that June's Leonard-Thomas Hearns 
fight brought in. . . . Shame on Channel 4. The station's promotional spots for 
"Sunday Night Sports" last weekend said Fred Roggin would be on. So you stay up 
to watch and what do you get? Mike Smith, of all people. The station fired 
Smith, but for some reason still brings him back occasionally. . . . Someone 
should tell Smith that North Carolina State is not the Tar Heels. He had the 
Tar Heels being put on probation the other night. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended viewing: If you didn't see Bud Greenspan's "16 Days of Glory: Seoul 
'88" the first time it was shown on the Disney Channel, mark down these other 
play dates: Saturday at 10 p.m., next Thursday at 12:30 a.m. and Dec. 30 at 
12:30 p.m. Never mind that the Olympic Games took place over a year ago, this 
film is a tremendously moving and entertaining piece of work. . . . Lyle Alzado 
has replaced Jim Valvano as the host of the Steve Rotfeld-produced show, "The 
Lighter Side of Sports," which is carried by ESPN. Alzado didn't fare too well 
as a commentator for NBC, but this role seems to be more suited to his talents.

MAJERUS CRITICAL BUT STABLE AFTER BYPASS SURGERY

Utah basketball Coach Rick Majerus underwent coronary bypass surgery for more 
than five hours Thursday and was listed in critical but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
"He came through the surgery very well," LDS Hospital spokesman Tim Madden 
said. "His surgeon expects a normal recovery and a normal resumption of 
activities." 
</P>
<P>
Majerus, 41, received seven bypasses, and the amount of time spent on the 
operating table was normal for heart surgery, according to doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Majerus experienced chest pains after a game against Purdue two weeks ago, and 
his condition was considered serious enough to require open-heart surgery. 
Before the operation, Majerus said that assistant Joe Cravens would lead the 
Utes (4-2) for the remainder of the season.

Presidents of NCAA colleges and universities were urged to support a proposal 
requiring disclosure of graduation rates among athletes as an alternative to a 
government-mandated program. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bill Bradley (D.-N.J.) and Rep. Tom McMillen (D-Md.) are sponsoring 
legislation that would require colleges to disclose how many of their athletes 
graduate. 
</P>
<P>
James Whalen, chairman of the American Council on Education board of directors, 
said federal intrusion would "set a very dangerous precedent and would open a 
door that we will never be able to close again." 
</P>
<P>
Whalen has also asked for a favorable vote on a proposal to shorten football 
and basketball seasons. The proposals are up for approval at the NCAA annual 
meeting Jan. 7-9.

NEWSWIRE: GOTTFRIED REPORTEDLY FIRED AS COACH AT PITT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
University of Pittsburgh Coach Mike Gottfried, who didn't have a losing season 
in four years but failed to return Pitt to national football prominence, was 
fired Thursday, according to athletic department sources. 
</P>
<P>
Gottfried, who feuded with the media and with his own administrators while 
going 26-17-2 in four seasons, reportedly was fired after he refused Athletic 
Director Edward Bozik's request to resign during a meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Bozik nor Gottfried could be reached for comment, and Pitt officials, 
in a brief statement, would confirm only that the meeting was held. 
</P>
<P>
There was no word on whether Gottfried, given what was described as a lifetime 
contract in April, 1988, would coach the No. 23 Panthers (7-3-1) against Texas 
A&amp;M in the Dec. 30 John Hancock Bowl, formerly the Sun Bowl, in El Paso.

BIRD SHOWS HE'S BACK: 40 POINTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
For the first quarter of the season, Larry Bird's shooting touch has been 
missing. Back after being out of all but the first six games last season 
because of surgery on both heels, he is playing without pain but with- out his 
accustomed shooting success. 
</P>
<P>
Through 20 games, he was making only 46% of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
The magic touch came back Wednesday night at Boston, and Bird scored 40 points 
in leading the Celtics to a 109-97 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
As the Celtics ended a two-game losing streak and improved their record to 
12-9, Bird was 17 for 27 from the field. He also had 11 rebounds and 10 assists 
for his fourth triple-double of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Bird, playing all but two minutes, had 23 points in the first half to help 
build a 51-42 lead and the SuperSonics never threatened in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The performance by Bird, who reached 18,391 points to pass Julius Erving and 
become 21st on the all-time scoring list, spoiled the return of K.C. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who was coach when the Celtics last won the championship, is an 
assistant coach for the Sonics. He was given a standing ovation by the Boston 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 99, Milwaukee 93 -- The return of injured Larry Nance has given a 
lift to the Cavaliers, who have won all three games since he came back. 
</P>
<P>
In this victory at Richfield, Ohio, Nance showed no ill effects from the major 
surgery on his ankle last season. He had 31 points, 10 rebounds and two blocked 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 112, Atlanta 103 -- Hersey Hawkins and Johnny Dawkins of the 76ers 
put a stop to the Hawks' seven-game winning streak in this game at 
Philadelphia. Hawkins had 27 points, and Dawkins had 23 points and nine 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins had a game-high 38 points. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 134, Denver 114 -- Chris Mullin had 33 points and a career-high 18 
rebounds to lead the Warriors' romp at Oakland. Mullin had a lifetime rebound 
average of 3.3 per game. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 90, Minnesota 87 -- The Timberwolves continue to play tough games, but 
they also continue to lose. 
</P>
<P>
The Mavericks, although they scored only nine points in the fourth quarter at 
Minneapolis, held on to hand the Timberwolves their 15th loss in 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 102, Phoenix 95 -- John Stockton had 22 points and 15 rebounds at Salt 
Lake City and the Jazz rode a 11-0 run late in the game to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Johnson's basket with 3:38 left gave the Suns an 88-83 lead. But they 
failed to score for 2 1/2 minutes and fell behind. Karl Malone's jump shot with 
1:38 put Utah ahead to stay. DAN HAFNER

BRAZIL'S WORSENING RICH-POOR GAP HEIGHTENS FEARS OF UPRISING;

SAO JOAO DE MERITI, Brazil 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Maria da Penha Ventura goes to the supermarket in this working-class 
suburb north of Rio de Janeiro, she often sees other shoppers caught at the 
check-out counter in a painful ritual of poverty. Short of money, they are 
forced to subtract needed food items one by one until they can pay the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"What people suffer at the supermarket is sad and very embarrassing," Ventura, 
50 and widowed, said the other day, lamenting what she said was the plight of 
every poor Brazilian: "He has no way to live in dignity." 
</P>
<P>
While Brazil has the largest economy in Latin America and the ninth-largest in 
the world, the majority of Brazilians live in privation, denied the plenty 
enjoyed by the well-off minority. In a sense, the country is like a 
well-stocked supermarket where most customers are caught short at the cash 
register. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the frustration of the poor majority is turning to anger. 
</P>
<P>
"More and more, the anger is growing," Ventura said. "If it keeps on this way, 
I would say it will explode." 
</P>
<P>
Some Brazilian social scientists agree that the severe economic inequality is 
developing into a potentially explosive social conflict, a volatile class 
struggle pitting rich against poor. 
</P>
<P>
In Brazil's first presidential elections since 1960, the key issue is the 
unequal distribution of income. Significantly, both candidates in the runoff 
scheduled for Dec. 17 have taken sides with the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Centrist candidate Fernando Collor de Mello has adopted a populist approach, 
accusing the government of neglecting the needs of the poor while tolerating 
official corruption and overpaying privileged public servants known as 
"maharajas." He promises to hunt down the maharajas and root out poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Socialist candidate Luis Inacio da Silva, known as Lula, accuses the wealthy 
elite of exploiting the poor through a backward capitalist system and a 
government that represents its interests. In a campaign of poor against rich, 
Lula is promising to change the economic structure. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Cologrossi, president of a foundation in the state of Rio de Janeiro that 
provides services for homeless people, said Lula is trying to drive a wedge 
between rich and poor, between workers and employers. 
</P>
<P>
"That is a very dangerous policy," Cologrossi, a former congressman, warned. 
"If it worked, it would mean revolution; it would mean a class war." 
</P>
<P>
A powerful sector of the Brazilian Roman Catholic Church has no problem with 
Lula's stance. Activist priests in poor rural villages, city slums and teeming 
suburbs like Sao Joao de Meriti are openly proselytizing for Lula and his 
Marxist-oriented Workers' Party. 
</P>
<P>
For years, these priests have been working with lay groups called 
Ecclasiastical Base Communities and other grass-roots organizations, promoting 
liberation theology, consciousness-raising and political action as the answer 
to the frustration of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura lives on a dirt lane in Sao Joao de Meriti, in a simple brick house 
with a single bedroom she shares with four of her six grown children and an 
8-year-old grandson. Sitting in a threadbare armchair in the house's tiny 
living room, where a tattered gray blanket serves as a rug, she talked with a 
reporter about the plight of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
She said she is a leader in her neighborhood Base Community, but she said most 
of the 500,000 people in the suburb, as angry as they are about their poverty, 
still do not believe as she does that political action can bring change. 
</P>
<P>
"They put up with the oppressor because they feel weak," she said. "They want 
change, but they want change to come by itself. They don't believe in the power 
of struggle." 
</P>
<P>
But eventually, she predicted, the tables will be turned. 
</P>
<P>
"That oppression is not going to continue the way it is,' she said. "It can't. 
Jesus will not let it. The people are going to become conscious of that." 
</P>
<P>
Father David Raimundo dos Santos, a Catholic priest who works with groups of 
poor people in Sao Joao de Meriti, openly declares his hope for an election 
victory by the left. He said the disparity between rich and poor has generated 
a social conflict that is erupting already in violent incidents. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Saturday, crowds in the southern city of Porto Alegre raided 
downtown stores in a frenzy of daytime looting that continued for hours. "The 
conflict is forcing the Brazilian people in that direction," Dos Santos said. 
</P>
<P>
The most urgent complaint of poor workers today is the erosion of their buying 
power by inflation, according to Irineu Guimaraes, president of a Rio de 
Janeiro federation of slum dwellers' associations. Inflation is racing at a 
breakneck pace of 40% a month. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a general revolt over the wage loss," Guimaraes said. He said 
elections and the expectation of a new government have dampened the revolt, but 
perhaps only temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
"The people are voting with the hope of improvement," he said. "If there isn't 
any, if things get worse instead of getting better, anything can happen. 
Looting will start to break out everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Amaury de Souza, a Brazilian political scientist with a doctoral degree from 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that inflation is the "Latin 
American way of waging class warfare." 
</P>
<P>
Workers agitate and strike for salary increases, but when they get them, they 
themselves pay the increased labor costs in higher prices for consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
"The laborers lose what they have, so then they start again," De Souza said. It 
is all blamed on inflation, but "it is important to understand that there is a 
serious distributive conflict at the base of inflation. . . . It is obviously a 
mass redistribution of income from the bottom to the top." 
</P>
<P>
"The Brazilian miracle" of economic growth in the 1970s rapidly expanded total 
income and raised hopes of a better life for the poor as many of them rose into 
the middle class. While a modern industrial sector burgeoned in the southeast 
region of the country, however, the central, northern and northeastern regions 
remained largely backward and undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of poor rural families migrated to the cities, providing a large labor 
pool that helped keep wages down for unskilled workers. Because managers were 
relatively scarce, their pay increased rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
And so the growth of the 1970s did not diminish the gaping difference between 
the extremes of rich Brazil and poor Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
"Brazil grew, modernized, industrialized, and the same contrast continues," 
said Charles Mueller, president of the official Brazilian Institute for 
Geography and Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s have been a decade of discouraging stagnation that has added to the 
desperation of those at the bottom of the income pyramid. In the first round of 
presidential elections Nov. 15, the great majority of the voters cast their 
ballots for candidates advocating action to correct the imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a gigantic demand for change," political scientist Helio Jaguaribe said 
in an interview. He emphasized that change is overdue. 
</P>
<P>
"Brazil is the country with the greatest concentration of income in the world," 
he said. Such a skewed distribution as Brazil's is not found "even in India, in 
Mexico, in Honduras. It is the worst in the world." 
</P>
<P>
More than half of all Brazilian workers earn the equivalent of about $120 a 
month or less. This poor majority of the country's 145 million people makes do 
on less than one-sixth of the national income, while the richest 10% of the 
population receives half of the total. (In the United States, the richest 10% 
receives less than one-fourth of the income.) 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, the Brazilian poor are often undernourished, unhealthy 
and ignorant. Less than one-fourth of the population has completed the eighth 
grade of school, compared with more than two-thirds in neighboring Argentina. 
The Brazilian's average life expectancy is 65 years, six years less than the 
Argentine's. 
</P>
<P>
The extreme inequality in Brazilian society is reflected in the term 
"Belindia," coined by economist Edmar Bacha to indicate that the comfort of 
Belgium and the misery of India exist side by side in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
The richest 14 million Brazilians have a per-capita income of about $10,000 a 
year, similar to that of a small European country. "The poorest 70 million live 
on about $500 a year each, which is as poor as the average for India," Bacha 
said in his office at Rio's Catholic University, where he teaches. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate inequality, that of masters and slaves, persisted legally in 
Brazil until 1888 under South America's only monarchy. Some social scientists 
say remnants of Brazil's system of bondage persist four generations after 
emancipation. 
</P>
<P>
"The mentality of the Brazilian dominant class still bears deep marks from the 
slave period," said Herbert de Souza, head of the Brazilian Institute for 
Social and Economic Analysis. "They still feel that they are the masters." 
</P>
<P>
A member of the Brazilian elite often pays employees the same amount for a 
month of work as he does for a restaurant lunch, de Souza observed, and added: 
"He pays that to his employees without a thought. He even says, 'They should be 
thankful that I am giving them work.' " 
</P>
<P>
De Souza blames the military government of 1964-1985 for ruthlessly suppressing 
popular labor, church community groups that had begun a movement for change in 
the early 1960s. With the gradual return of democracy, the movement has 
regrouped and become politically active. 
</P>
<P>
"The news is that there are workers trying to break with that traditional 
structure, break with that master-slave relationship," De Souza said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many poor Brazilians have entered an informal or underground economy 
that includes street vendors, curbside parking attendants, handicraft makers, 
repairmen, seamstresses, and others whose money-making activities are not 
reflected in the official gross national product. De Souza said the underground 
economy may account for one-third or more of the total economy, giving millions 
of poor Brazilians a better chance to survive and sometimes thrive. 
</P>
<P>
"That underground world is perhaps what explains why social explosions have not 
occurred in Brazil," he said. "It is a huge cushion from the crisis." 
</P>
<P>
But a "serious, profound social crisis" remains, said Prof. Gilberto Velho, an 
anthropologist with the National Museum. Velho said traditional paternalistic 
relationships between rich and poor have broken down, opening the way for class 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
Presidential candidate Lula, a former factory worker, has risen on a growing 
movement designed to confront the upper class through popular political and 
labor organization. Collor, on the other hand, is seen by his poor followers as 
a member of the upper class who will champion their cause at the level of power 
where he was born, according to Velho. 
</P>
<P>
"They believe he is a kind of avenger of the oppressed classes who will improve 
their situation," the anthropologist said. The "Collor phenomenon," he said, 
reflects a centuries-old folk belief in the possibility of a "savior, a prince, 
a superior being," who will deliver the people from their hardship and misery. 
</P>
<P>
Muniz Sodre, a political scientist who heads the communications department at 
the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said there is little likelihood that 
the gap between rich and poor will close significantly even with Lula as 
president. According to Sodre, the Brazilian government is and has always been 
administered by a powerful bureaucratic Establishment allied with the wealthy 
elite of society. 
</P>
<P>
Through successive changes in government, the Establishment has renewed itself 
from generation to generation, perpetuating its grip on power with the help of 
the military and the rich, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The masses of Brazil are irrevocably condemned to another world," Sodre said.

SOUTHERN SPAIN JUMPING TOWARD 21ST CENTURY; 
</P>
<P>
WORLD'S FAIR: ANDALUSIA AND THE CITY OF SEVILLE ARE UNDERGOING THE GREATEST 
FACE LIFT IN THEIR HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
SEVILLE, Spain 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four bridges span the indolent Guadalquivir River here today, legacy of 20 
centuries of settlement that began in Roman times. Over the next three years, 
seven new bridges will be built across the muddy river that is Seville's 
trademark and its lifeblood. 
</P>
<P>
Storied Seville, one giant detour now, is in the throes of the greatest face 
lift in its history. Dazzling modernization for the regional capital is the 
cornerstone of a regional development scheme that will yank flamenco-and-sherry 
Andalusia pell-mell into the 21st Century. Amid great expectation, and some 
disquiet, the era of the superlative has come to laggard southern Spain. 
</P>
<P>
The catalyst is a 1992 world's fair, Expo '92, that will be this century's last 
and, yes, history's biggest. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government, with a big financial assist from the European 
Community, is investing $7 billion to bring the rickety Andalusian 
infrastructure up to continental standards. A self-financing state corporation 
will spend $800 million to prepare the exhibition site on 538-acre La Cartuja 
Island in the middle of the river. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of millions more will come from 170 exhibitors at Expo itself -- 101 
countries have signed up so far -- and from off-site private investors hoping 
to cash in with everything from souvenir shops to luxury hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Roads, a high-speed railroad, expanded regional airports, a refurbished port, 
and high-tech telecommunications are all wending their way from drawing boards 
to the streets and countryside of Spain's most populous region. 
</P>
<P>
In the Spanish matrix, Andalusia, with 17% of the national population but only 
12% of national income, is renowned more for graceful languor than dynamism. 
What is being called Europe's most ambitious project of the '90s is expected to 
generate 200,000 jobs for a region whose unemployment is higher than in the 
rest of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Even in its early earthmoving, pipe-laying stages, regional development is 
having great impact: Spain will grow economically 5% this year; Andalusia 6.8%. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Expo's 176-night run ends on the 500th anniversary of Christopher 
Columbus' arrival in the New World, Oct. 12, 1992, it will have reached into 
the lives of all 6.8 million Andalusians. 
</P>
<P>
Seville, now wed mostly to tourism, will get its first ring road, and be linked 
to the rest of Spain by multi-lane expressways for the first time. A bullet 
train will halve travel time from Madrid to three hours, and passengers will 
detrain at a spanking new Seville terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Regional airports at Seville, Malaga and Jerez will lose their provincial air. 
The phones will work. 
</P>
<P>
Such are the promises of officials at the autonomous regional Andalusian 
government who are overseeing the construction. 
</P>
<P>
"We are providing investment that Andalusia needs in an accelerated form. 
Necessary improvements that might be scheduled over 15 or 20 years will instead 
be accomplished in three," said Jaime Montaner, public works minister for the 
regional government who is overseeing the construction. 
</P>
<P>
The overall project is enormous, though, and amid traffic-jammed, 
construction-everywhere inconvenience, nerves are already jangling. 
</P>
<P>
"Seville is uncomfortable, but everybody in Seville wants Expo. We all 
understand that it is worth suffering now for the benefits that will come 
later," Montaner said. 
</P>
<P>
With the fair pledged to open Easter Monday, April 20, 1992, construction 
deadlines are inelastic. A road finished months late may benefit Andalusia as 
much in the long run but in the interim may imperil Expo's success and 
embarrass Spain with the whole world watching. 
</P>
<P>
Spain will mark Columbus' anniversary as its own coming of age in a uniting 
Europe. In addition to Expo, it will sponsor the 1992 Summer Olympics in 
Barcelona, a European Cultural Year in Madrid, and a major exhibit in Toledo 
celebrating Spain's Jewish and Muslim heritage. 
</P>
<P>
Planners expect that 18 million visitors will come to Seville's Expo, and pay 
an average daily admission price of about $20 to see a fair conceived as a 
cross between a Disney extravaganza and a classical exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Montaner promises that Andalusia will not disappoint them. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no cause for alarm. On the contrary, things are moving well. 
Everything is on schedule. It's a great challenge, but we'll be ready," he told 
a visitor to his office in the cobblestones-and-tourists old quarter of a city 
that became one of the richest in the world when it enjoyed a 16th-Century 
monopoly of trade with what is now Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the bulldozers and tumbled red earth on the Expo island, Jacinto Pellon, 
the bearded engineer and weekend sailor who is chief executive of the Seville 
Universal Exposition 1992, is equally upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
"On site, we are on time. We are pushing the exhibitors to begin their own 
construction next spring," he said, describing his project as "something like 
Epcot, but a bit more serious, and with a lot of entertainment; rock to ballet 
to symphonic music to experimental theater." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Information Agency will sponsor the $20-million American pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Columbus is the star of what is technically a Universal Exposition in the 
tradition of the only other three of the breed since World War II: Brussels 
'58, Montreal '67, and Osaka '70. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the 15th-Century Carthusian monastery of Santa Maria de las Cuevas on 
La Cartuja Island that Columbus planned his journey. He lived behind the thick 
monastery walls between trips and was buried there for a time. 
</P>
<P>
The monastery itself, later converted to a ceramics factory that operated until 
1982, is being restored, nave to frescoes, as the symbol of an exhibition that 
will also feature the replica of the 15th-Century port of Seville whence the 
Admiral of the Ocean Sea ventured west with the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa 
Maria. 
</P>
<P>
Exposition chief Pellon says Expo will draw on past international extravaganzas 
such as the Osaka fair and the Los Angeles Olympics, but with an important 
difference. After Expo ends, the island and many of its structures will become 
a center for university instruction and corporate research and development. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the lasting benefits will be construction of the the first 
full-blown opera house for a city to which opera is no stranger: "Barber of 
Seville" to "Carmen" to "Fidelio" and "Don Giovanni."

NEW TOKYO POWER BROKER COOL TO U.S. CAMPAIGN TO OPEN UP ECONOMY; 
</P>
<P>
JAPAN: KOMEI PARTY CAPTURES ENOUGH PARLIAMENT SEATS TO FORCE RULING LIBERAL 
DEMOCRATS TO LISTEN TO ITS VIEWS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The new power broker in Tokyo will not be giving the United States much help in 
its pro-consumer campaign to open up Japan's economy but may offer more 
financial support for American troops stationed here. 
</P>
<P>
The power broker is the Komei (Clean Government) Party, which holds the casting 
vote in the upper house of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the result of the general election for the lower house that is 
expected in February, the ruling Liberal Democrats will be forced to turn to 
the Komei Party as the only potentially cooperative group with enough seats in 
the upper house to help it pass legislation. Approval of the upper house is 
required to pass all bills except treaties and the national budget, but the 
conservatives lost their majority in that chamber for the first time last July. 
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview, Koshiro Ishida, the Komei Party's chairman, said the 
American campaign to open up the Japanese economy and improve life for Japanese 
consumers was "useful" to his party's policy of promoting better living 
standards. The yearlong negotiations, known as the Structural Impediments 
Initiative, were launched in September. But Ishida made it clear that, except 
for land prices, his Buddhist-backed party was not interested in American 
appeals for reforms in Japan's distribution system that could drive down prices 
of daily necessities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's true that food prices are high but not so high that people can't tolerate 
them. If you look around, you can find inexpensive clothes. Consumers are 
satisfied with clothing and food. . . . To consumers, the biggest problem is 
housing. . . . Unless the problems of housing and commuting are solved, people 
will not have the feeling that their personal living standards have become 
enriched," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ishida did offer support for a U.S. initiative to win an increase in Japan's 
payments for the maintenance of about 60,000 American military personnel here 
-- even if it means revising a Status of Forces Agreement, a move that the 
government and the Liberal Democrats have resisted. 
</P>
<P>
"Right before an election, it is not easy to go so far," he said, referring to 
support for such a revision. "But as far as our feeling is concerned, revising 
it in the future is conceivable." 
</P>
<P>
"Further increases are unavoidable," he said of the payments. 
</P>
<P>
At present, Japan pays about $2.5 billion, or about 40% of the $6 billion that 
the United States spends annually to station its troops here. 
</P>
<P>
Ishida also criticized the Socialist Party, the No. 1 opposition party, for 
refusing to give unqualified support to continuance of the security treaty with 
the United States. Reminded that the Komei Party when it was established in the 
early 1960s opposed the U.S.-Japan Security treaty, Ishida said, "If the world 
trends change, it goes without saying that not having the treaty is desirable. 
But we think that ideal is a matter for the future. Realistically, we 
acknowledge the significance of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty." 
</P>
<P>
Ishida said his party will insist that annual increases of between 5% and 6% 
that have been approved for Japan's own defense budget be pared down. More 
funds should go to foreign aid, which should be raised close to 1% of the gross 
national product, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Komei chairman ruled out any possibility of forming a coalition with Prime 
Minister Toshiki Kaifu's ruling party after the lower house election. Instead, 
he predicted that "political conditions will be unstable" as the election 
produces a tri-polar political structure lacking a central guiding force. 
</P>
<P>
"Without experiencing a year or two of political bargaining, I don't think that 
a regrouping of the political parties can (occur)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ishida predicted that the Liberal Democrats will even be forced to negotiate 
the budget even before it is submitted to Parliament because of budget-related 
bills that will require passage by the upper house. 
</P>
<P>
"The fiscal 1990 budget will be the last that the Liberal Democratic Party 
formulates by itself," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
So far, maneuvering leading up to the lower house election has focused on 
Socialist attempts to hammer out a coalition agreement with the Komei Party and 
two other moderate opposition forces. 
</P>
<P>
But in a meeting with a group of visiting American journalists, Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Mayumi Moriyama said Kaifu's Liberal Democrats will seek a coalition 
with the Komei Party after the general election. 
</P>
<P>
Ishida, however, said his party will campaign for political reform and 
abolition of the ruling party's controversial 3% consumption tax and those 
positions "won't permit us to shake hands with the Liberal Democrats quickly." 
</P>
<P>
As the price for cooperating in enacting legislation, he said, the Komei Party 
will press the Liberal Democrats to accept its proposals for sweeping 
anti-corruption reforms and for shifting the focus of economic policy from 
promoting overall growth to raising individual living standards. 
</P>
<P>
Ishida said his party will continue to try to work out a coalition agreement 
with the Socialists but said that ultimately the Komei, as well as the 
middle-of-the-road Democratic Socialist Party, probably would join hands with 
the Liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Socialists cannot adopt a realistic policy, it won't be possible to 
achieve an opposition-led coalition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the four would-be coalition partners of the opposition will 
be unable to win a majority in the lower house election, although, with 
Communist victories included, the Liberal Democrats could lose their majority. 
In that event, the Komei Party would gain pivotal power in both houses. 
</P>
<P>
The Komei Party, Ishida emphasized, will not join any coalition that includes 
the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Its casting vote in the upper house consists of 21 representatives, or three 
more than the 18 that the Liberal Democrats lack for a majority. 
</P>
<P>
Ishida predicted that after the lower house election, the political spectrum 
would wind up divided into three segments -- the Liberal Democrats on one side, 
the Socialists on the other, and the Komei Party and the Democratic Socialists 
in the middle. The three poles, he said, would engage in horse-trading on 
virtually every bill submitted to Parliament. Communists, he added, would 
remain outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest possibility is that after one, two or three years of experience 
with a tri-polar political structure, talks will occur between the Liberal 
Democratic Party and the Komei Party and the Democratic Socialists (for a 
coalition)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"At least a year" will have to pass after the general election before the Komei 
Party can decide whether to join the Liberal Democrats in a coalition, Ishida 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, despite its new clout, the Komei Party, which draws much of its 
support from an often-controversial Buddhist laymen's organization, the Soka 
Gakkai (Value Creating Society), suffered a setback in the July upper house 
election. Financial scandals that hit the party in the last 18 months also 
portend a "very severe" result in the forthcoming lower house vote, Ishida 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
"For a quarter of a century, we campaigned for clean politics. (The scandals) 
inflicted huge damage. . . . We won't be able to restore (voters') trust in one 
stroke," he said.

SKI RESORTS TRY TO STOP SLIDE IN PROFITS; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: LACK OF SNOW AND FEWER SKIERS PROMPT MANY LODGE OPERATORS TO 
INCREASE ADVERTISING AND OFFER DISCOUNTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Without the lure of cold and snowy weather in the Southland mountains so far 
this season, many ski resort managers are finding it lonely at the top. 
</P>
<P>
Although most Southland ski resort operators used snow-making machines to open 
shortly after Thanksgiving, ski visits are down by as much as 70% at some 
resorts, compared to the same period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The number of ski visits to California resorts had been rising steadily in 
recent years, reaching 7.1 million last season. But this year, facing sales 
dips as steep as their slopes and the possibility of melting profit margins, 
operators are trying to generate business by developing incentive packages, 
sponsoring advertising campaigns and touting their snow-making technology. 
</P>
<P>
The machines can make snow, but making skiers appear is much harder, said Bob 
Roberts, executive director of the California Ski Industry Assn., a trade group 
represents 38 state ski areas. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that city-dwelling ski buffs tend to stay away from the slopes 
when the weather at home is warm. Temperatures have been unusually high in 
November and December, ranging from the mid-60s to as high as the 80s in the 
Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
"If the weather is unseasonably warm," Roberts said, "people become tennis 
players and golfers." 
</P>
<P>
And that turns the ski business cold. 
</P>
<P>
Ski visits at Snow Summit, a resort at Big Bear Lake that opened Nov. 29, are 
off 70% from last season's pace, said spokeswoman Catherine Boire. 
</P>
<P>
Midday temperatures in Big Bear Lake have usually been in the 40-degree range, 
Boire said, although temperatures have fallen to freezing at night. 
</P>

"People assume that (skiing) conditions are poor because there's no natural 
snow," she said. "Right now our snow is 100% man-made, but it's excellent 
powder." 
</P>
<P>
Bear Mountain, another Big Bear Lake resort, has had a moderate decline in 
business compared to the cooler two-week period last year, said Bradley Wilson, 
sales director at the operation. The resort more than doubled its business last 
winter, primarily by investing $16,000 on snow-making equipment and other 
physical improvements, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We really don't depend on natural snow for opening and maintaining the (ski) 
runs," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Some operators are trying to lure excursionists by offering discount packages. 
For example, Snow Valley Ski Resort in Running Springs is selling a daylong 
pass for $25 -- instead of the normal $33 -- until Dec. 22. The resort has also 
been running a free lunch program, which expires today, said Margaret 
Krajewski, marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
The moves are in response to a sharp dropoff in visits. Since opening its 
season Nov. 29, Snow Valley has done only about half as much business as it did 
during the same period last year, Krajewski said. 
</P>
<P>
Business is also down in some parts of Lake Tahoe's winter resort community, 
said Phil Weidinger, a spokesman for Ski Lake Tahoe, a marketing group 
representing five separate ski areas. Those reporting declines say there are 
fewer visitors from the San Francisco Bay Area, possibly because many of those 
Californians are still reeling from the financial effects of the recent 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
To offset losses from the Bay Area market, the Tahoe group is now trying -- for 
the first time -- to promote its resorts via television ads in Southland 
markets. The campaign was launched two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Weidinger said all Western resorts could see a jump in business during the 
financially crucial final two weeks in December if there is a white Christmas 
in the highlands. 
</P>
<P>
"A little help from Mother Nature and we'll all be doing fine," he said.

FACTORING FIRM CUTS CREDIT FOR CAMPEAU MERCHANDISE; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: SUPPLIERS WORRY ABOUT RETAILERS' POTENTIAL FOR BANKRUPTCY. AND 
CAMPEAU-OWNED STORES MIGHT HAVE SHIPMENTS HALTED.

Reacting to the potential bankruptcy of retail subsidiaries of Campeau Corp., 
the nation's second-largest factoring company said Thursday that it no longer 
would extend credit on merchandise bound for Campeau-owned department stores, 
including such chains as Bloomingdale's. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago-based Heller Financial Inc. shut off credit lines to Campeau suppliers 
as of Thursday morning, spokeswoman Laura Jiracek said. Factoring companies 
like Heller advance money to suppliers to cover bills due from retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by the Campeau-owned retailers that they may have to take 
refuge in bankruptcy court also intensified concerns among suppliers and 
increased the chances that shipments could be halted. 
</P>
<P>
Several apparel and accessory manufacturers said they were keeping in close 
touch with executives in charge of Campeau's U.S. retailing operations. Bills 
have been paid on time so far, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The suppliers, whose fates are tied to retailers, expressed hope that business 
wouldn't be disrupted as Campeau copes with a worsening cash shortage. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very worried about the situation," said Howard Bloom, president and chief 
executive of Chetta B Inc., a clothing maker. "It gets progressively worse 
looking every day. I'm taking a wait-and-see posture." 
</P>
<P>
Retail analysts said disclosures by Campeau's Federated Department Stores Inc. 
and Allied Stores Corp. of deepening financial difficulties were unsurprising 
given the fierce competition taking place in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Federated and Allied said in documents submitted to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission that their cash could run out by March or sooner and that they might 
seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. 
</P>
<P>
The move would permit Campeau-owned retailers to remain operating while their 
Canadian parent company sorted out its financial problems. At the heart of the 
trouble is the massive debt Campeau acquired in taking over Federated in 1988 
for $6.7 billion and Allied in 1986 for $3.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 17-store Bloomingdale's chain, which is up for sale, 
Federated operates Abraham &amp; Straus, Burdines, Lazarus, Rich's and 
Goldsmith's. Under the Allied umbrella are the Bon Marche, Jordan Marsh, Maas 
Brothers and Stern's. The two combined have about 100,000 employees and 260 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
Vendors, such as clothing makers Bernard Chaus Inc., Ellen Tracy Inc., Liz 
Claiborne Inc. and others that do business with many of the stores, said they 
would continue to monitor developments at Campeau and that up to now they've 
been satisfied with how promptly the company has paid for goods. 
</P>
<P>
Another yardstick of Campeau's relationship with vendors could come when some 
manufacturers seek credit in coming weeks to ship spring merchandise to the 
stores.

U.S. INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE AIR FARE COLLUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Justice Department antitrust lawyers are investigating whether airline fare 
increases in September resulted from any collusion among the carriers, the 
department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Civil investigative demands -- the equivalent of criminal subpoenas -- seeking 
internal pricing information were sent to several airlines soon after the 
increase went into effect Sept. 29, a department spokeswoman said. Industry 
sources said most major airlines received the department's requests for data. 
</P>
<P>
Although acknowledging that the investigation is under way, Amy Brown, the 
department spokeswoman, declined to state whether it signaled a renewed 
interest in assuring price competition in the airline industry or whether the 
nature of this particular increase seemed different from other industrywide 
price changes in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The increases, which appeared first in a Sept. 18 announcement by American 
Airlines, ranged from $10 to $80 a trip and were pegged to the number of days 
before the flight that tickets were purchased -- with the biggest price hikes 
imposed on tickets purchased closest to departure. The increases appear to have 
been adopted throughout the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We cooperated and returned the requested documents a couple of weeks ago," Pam 
Hanlon, a spokeswoman for Pan American World Airways, said. "We would be 
reluctant to disclose" the specific items sought by the department, she added. 
</P>
<P>
However, a source familiar with the civil investigative demands said they 
included any correspondence or other contact regarding pricing among the 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
"We were contacted several weeks ago by the Justice Department and asked for 
information about the fare action late in the fall," said Mary O'Neill, an 
American Airlines spokeswoman. "We have cooperated fully." 
</P>
<P>
Edwin I. Colodny, chairman and president of USAir, said Thursday: "It's my 
understanding that the Justice Department asked all the airlines for 
information. I'm not worried about it. There is no collusion." He spoke in a 
brief interview at a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
Existence of the investigation was first disclosed Thursday by the Wall Street 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is the Justice Department's first civil antitrust inquiry 
into airline pricing to surface publicly since 1985 when American Airlines, its 
chief executive, Robert Crandall, and the Justice Department entered into a 
consent decree barring conversations on fares between American and competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Though he declined to discuss details of the current probe, Brown said it is 
not related to the investigation of predatory pricing that James F. Rill, 
assistant attorney general for antitrust, discussed in Senate testimony Sept. 
20. 
</P>
<P>
That investigation, which is looking into possible cutting of fares below cost 
to drive competitors out of the market, is continuing, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Concern about rising air fares and decreased competition has been expressed in 
Congress recently. After airline deregulation in 1978, air fares dropped 
sharply under pressure from new, price-slashing competitors. But some of these 
competitors have dropped out of business, giving rise to fears about lack of 
effective competition. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Denise Gellene in Los Angeles contributed to this story.

One-Year T-Bill Rates Fall: Interest rates on 52-week Treasury bills fell to 
the lowest level since June, 1988. The Treasury sold $9.75 billion of new bills 
at an average discount rate of 7.14%, down from 7.17% at the last auction Nov. 
16. The rates were the lowest since June 30, 1988, when the one-year bills sold 
for 7.04%. The new discount rate understates the actual return to investors -- 
7.66%, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,278.10.

First Interstate Ratings Lowered: Duff &amp; Phelps, a Chicago investment 
research firm, said it lowered its ratings on First Interstate Bancorp amid new 
problems at the banking company's Texas unit. The ratings affect about $3 
billion in First Interstate's senior debt, subordinated debt and preferred 
stock. Duff &amp; Phelps said that although First Interstate's operations are 
strong in California, Oregon, Washington and Nevada, the banking firm's problem 
assets will continue to hurt profits.

Ashton-Tate Sells Stake in Database Firm: Ashton-Tate, the faltering Torrance 
software publisher best known for its dBase programs, said the divestiture of 
its less than 5% stake in the innovative and fast-growing Sybase database firm 
would reduce confusion among customers. An Ashton-Tate subsidiary competes 
directly with Sybase. Ashton-Tate sold its stake to Lotus Development Corp. for

XEROX SUES APPLE OVER GRAPHICS SOFTWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Xerox slapped Apple Computer with a $150-million lawsuit on Thursday, 
contending that Apple is illegally using the software that created the 
revolutionary graphics display on its highly popular Macintosh personal 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed late Thursday in federal court in San Francisco, is a bizarre 
turn in an already twisted tale surrounding the visual display currently used 
in Apple's Macintosh models. The display resembles a desk top and allows a user 
to manipulate data and issue instructions by using a set of pictures, or 
"icons." 
</P>
<P>
The Macintosh display, which has become an industry standard, is a key reason 
for the machine's popularity since its introduction in early 1984. Last year, 
Apple sued two computer industry heavyweights, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, 
for allegedly infringing on its copyrighted display. 
</P>
<P>
However, Xerox claims in its suit that the Macintosh display "stems from work 
originally done by Xerox" and has been used by Apple without Xerox permission. 
The suit notes that the display was first used by Apple in its now discontinued 
Lisa model introduced in 1982, as well in as the Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
Xerox said it has held a copyright on the display, which it first introduced on 
its now discontinued Star computer system, since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
A Xerox spokesman said the suit was filed now because recent changes in 
software protection and intellectual property laws make it easier to assert its 
position. He declined to specify those changes. 
</P>
<P>
An Apple spokeswoman said the company believes that the suit is without merit 
and that Xerox is attempting to assert its right to copyright an idea, rather 
than merely an expression of an idea. 
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said Apple has long acknowledged that its display was inspired 
by work done by others in the computer industry. But, she said, Apple claims 
that the display is its own through its investment of "time, people and effort" 
to create the software. 
</P>
<P>
Xerox said in the suit that Apple's use of the display and its licensing of it 
to other computer companies has allowed Apple to "unjustly" receive royalties 
and fees of more than $100 million. The suit also asks for at least another $50 
million because Apple's actions constitute "unfair competition and unfair 
business practices." 
</P>
<P>
Xerox Chairman and Chief Executive David T. Kearns said efforts to reach an 
amicable settlement, including a proposal for Apple to license the involved 
software from Xerox, were rebuffed after Xerox approached Apple last week with 
a proposal.

Aerospace manufacturer General Dynamics said Thursday that it is in the process 
of buying a 60-acre parcel north of San Diego, in what would be one of the 
largest land acquisitions in San Diego County by an industrial user in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics spokesman Jack Isabel confirmed late Thursday that his 
company's Electronics division is in escrow to purchase the property but said 
he could not discuss details, including what and when General Dynamics plans to 
build, how much it will spend on the facility or how many employees will be 
working at the new complex. 
</P>
<P>
However, the parcel is large enough to accommodate a 1 million-square-foot 
complex of research and industrial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The land General Dynamics is buying is located in the 4S Ranch Business Park, 
part of a massive 3,600-acre development in unincorporated San Diego County 
about 20 miles north of downtown San Diego. Located just west of San Diego's 
Rancho Bernardo suburb, the property is owned by the Ralphs family, founders of 
the 120-store chain of supermarkets of the same name. General Dynamics' 
Electronics division primarily makes automatic test equipment used for military 
aircraft including F-16 jet fighters, the C-17 cargo plane and the B-2 Stealth 
bomber. The division also makes aircraft radios. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics' purchase of the property is expected to close by the end of 
this year, sources said.

<P>
A new magazine aimed at helping small business owners solve their problems is 
due out early next year. At first, Independent Business will be available only 
to the 560,000 members of the National Federation of Independent Business. 
</P>
<P>
But plans call for expanding the circulation in the future, said editor Dan 
Kehrer. "We offer readers a real hands-on approach to running their business," 
said Kehrer. "We provide practical information and share advice from real 
business owners." 
</P>
<P>
One feature is called "Troubleshooter." The column highlights businesses that 
have run into bureaucratic hassles. The first issue chronicles one firm's 
problem with the Federal Aviation Administration and another's hassle with the 
Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine itself is the product of small business created by Michael 
Carpenter, the publisher; Thomas Sargent, publishing director, and Don 
Phillipson, editorial director. Independent Business' editorial offices are in 
Westlake Village.

Some Tips for Those Working at Home 
</P>
<P>
More than 60,000 greater Los Angeles residents are working at home, according 
to home-based business consultant Beth Smith. In 1987, 25 million people were 
working from home at least part of the time and Smith believes that the number 
will double by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Money, independence, freedom, adventure, resentment and frustration about their 
other jobs have prompted people to set up a home-based business. Smith, who 
frequently teaches courses on the subject, also publishes a bimonthly 
newsletter called Business Line. A trial subscription of two issues is 
available for $10. A one-year subscription is $24. For information write to 
Smith at: 12935 Chippewa St., Sylmar, Ca. 91342.

LAMB &amp; LION RECORDS ENDS CHAPTER 11

<TEXT>
<P>
Lamb &amp; Lion Records, a Christian record company in Burbank owned by 
entertainer Pat Boone, has emerged from reorganization under Chapter 11 of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code after an agreement was reached with its largest creditor, 
according to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
The label filed for Chapter 11 protection in September, 1988, in the wake of a 
dispute with Bell Savings &amp; Loan, which was owed nearly $200,000 at the 
time. The company emerged from Chapter 11 last month. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, an insolvent thrift based in San Mateo, was later sold to a group of 
investors led by former Treasury Secretary William Simon with about $565 
million in government assistance. Bell has since been merged by the Simon group 
into Western Federal Savings &amp; Loan in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, Lamb &amp; Lion has made a $30,000 payment on 
the loan.

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
Lamb &amp; Lion Records -- A story Friday about the emergence from Chapter 11 
bankruptcy by Lamb &amp; Lion Records, a Christian record company in Burbank 
owned by entertainer Pat Boone, was mistakenly cut and as a result omitted 
important details of the terms of the agreement with its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, Lamb &amp; Lion has made a $30,000 payment on 
the loan and will make additional monthly payments of $2,500 for nearly two 
years. The balance of the loan is to be paid after that period, according to 
court papers, and Boone is personally guaranteeing the loan. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the agreement, a lawsuit filed in late 1987 in San Mateo County 
Superior Court by Bell Savings &amp; Loan that accused Boone of fraud has now 
been dropped. Boone has denied the allegation, contending that he had been a 
good customer in making payments to Bell and was treated unfairly.

<P>
New worries about the economy, prompted by weak car sales and problems at two 
major retailers, pushed stocks broadly lower Thursday. The Dow Jones index of 
30 industrials, up 32.85 points in the two preceding sessions, dropped 7.46 to 
2,753.63. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advances by nearly 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 529 up, 996 down and 494 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume retreated to 178.70 million shares from Wednesday's 184.66 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's report by auto makers that car sales in early December fell to 
their lowest level in more than two years created fresh worries about weakness 
in the industrial economy, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders were also unsettled by word late Wednesday of deepening 
problems in the debt-burdened retailing empire of Campeau Corp. in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau officials said its Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores 
operations might file for bankruptcy protection in early 1990 if new agreements 
can't be reached with lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the wary mood was anticipation of a quarterly "triple-witching hour" 
today involving a series of expiring options and futures on stock indexes. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, the government is due to report the producer price index for 
November and the nation's international trade position for October. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors fell 1 1/8 to 43 1/2. A prominently featured story in the Wall 
Street Journal discussed the company's problems with a shrinking share of the 
U.S. car market. 
</P>
<P>
Among other actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph 
dropped 3/8 to 46 1/4, Exxon fell 1 1/8 to 49 5/8, Ford Motor dipped 3/4 to 44, 
and Philip Morris lost 5/8 to 42 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
In the recently beleaguered computer and technology sector, International 
Business Machines fell 3/4 to 95 1/8, Digital Equipment 2 3/8 to 80 1/4, and 
Apple Computer 1 1/8 to 34 7/8 in the over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
Mesa Limited Partnership tumbled 1 1/4 to 7 5/8. The partnership said it would 
stop paying cash distributions next year, citing depressed prices for natural 
gas. 
</P>
<P>
Polygram N.V. led the active list, trading at 16 7/8 after an initial public 
offering of 32 million shares at 16 by the company's parent, Philips N.V. 
</P>
<P>
UAL fell 5 1/2 to 163 1/4 as hopes continued to dim for a new deal to replace 
the planned buyout by an employee-management group that fell through two months 
ago. Elsewhere in the airline group, AMR lost 1 to 63 and Delta Air Lines was 
down 1/2 at 68 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed mixed reflecting concern among some 
investors over the market's recent high-paced advance. The Nikkei 225-share 
index surged 118.28 points to close at another new high of 38,180.70. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks fell sharply in London, as a weak performance on Wall Street encouraged 
a round of profit taking. The Financial Times 100-share index ended the day 
down 19.2 points to 2,367.0.

Bond Prices Rise on Fed Speculation 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose on speculation that the Federal Reserve may ease interest 
rates and on figures indicating that weekly unemployment insurance claims had 
risen. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 3/8 point, or $3.75 for every 
$1,000 in face value. Its yield, which declines when the price rises, fell to 
7.85% from 7.88% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Economists said the market was bolstered by speculation that the Fed would move 
to push interest rates lower -- a move that would push up bond prices -- in the 
near term, possibly today after the release of producer price index and 
industrial production figures. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Stone, a managing director of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates 
Inc., said Thursday's gains began with a government report that weekly 
unemployment insurance claims shot up by 86,000 to 396,000 in the week ended 
Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was

The dollar finished mixed in dull trading on world currency markets.

Gold prices slipped overseas but appeared to stabilize in U.S. dealings after 
Wednesday's steep plunge. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery 
settled at $408.30 an ounce, up 20 cents from late Wednesday. Republic National 
Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $408.30 an ounce, up 30 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market was extremely quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers and investors are awaiting today's release of the October trade report 
and producer prices and industrial production data for November.

In Tokyo, the dollar rose to close at 144.07 Japanese yen, from 143.70 yen on 
Wednesday. But later in London, it fell to 144.00 yen. In New York, the dollar 
finished at 144.15 yen, up from 144.05 yen late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British pound rose to $1.5970 from $1.5955 late Wednesday. In

Hog Prices Surge as Cold Continues 
</P>
<P>
Prices for near-term deliveries of hogs surged more than a penny a pound on the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange as frigid weather in the Midwest slowed marketings 
and reduced slaughter rates. 
</P>
<P>
The cold spell, which is expected to continue through the weekend, also 
contributed to gains in the cattle and grain futures markets. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, oil futures retreated and precious metals were 
mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
Hog futures settled 0.08 cent to 1.05 cents higher, with the contract for 
delivery in December up 1.05 cents at 52.75 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Live cattle futures were 0.15 to 0.60 cent higher, with December at 77.40 cents 
a pound; feeder cattle were 0.20 to 0.43 cent higher, with January at 83.72 
cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 1.10 to 1.60 cents lower, with 
February at 50.32 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The gains in hog futures extended a three-month advance from prices near 40 
cents a pound in mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
Cold weather typically supports the hog market for two reasons: Animals tend to 
burn energy rapidly in cold weather, causing weight loss when they are moved 
around; and farmers, like everyone else, tend to stay indoors in cold weather.

NEW JAGUAR FEATURES ALL-OUT SPEED, PRICE

<P>
British luxury car maker Jaguar, shifting gears after its recent agreement to a 
takeover by Detroit's Ford Motor Co., announced plans Thursday to produce a new 
200-m.p.h. sports model to compete with Ferrari and Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
The Jaguar XJ220 will cost $587,000 (366,850 pounds) and production will be 
limited to an initial 220 cars, or at most 350 if there is enough interest. But 
the car will not be available in the United States because it will meet only 
European specifications. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar said the XJ220 is designed to compete with the Porsche 959 and the 
Ferrari F40, which cost several hundred thousand pounds. It will be a 
four-wheel-drive sports car, powered by a V6 turbo racing engine and capable of 
reaching 60 m.p.h. in 3.5 seconds -- quicker acceleration than the Porsche 959 
-- and 100 m.p.h. in 8 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar Chairman Sir John Egan announced plans for the new super car just two 
days after the $2.6 billion (1.6 billion pound) takeover of the company by Ford 
was finalized. 
</P>
<P>
"The public response to the XJ220 concept car has been overwhelming," Egan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Jaguar unveiled a prototype of the XJ220 last year, but the Coventry-based firm 
feared that it would never go on sale because flagging profits would prevent 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Customers are being asked to put down a deposit of $80,000 (50,000 pounds) but 
will have to wait until 1992 before the first models roll off the production 
line. 
</P>
<P>
The wait could be worth it for the auto enthusiast with plenty of money. 
</P>
<P>
The Times of London estimated that collectors would be prepared to pay $1.6 
million (1 million pounds) for one of the cars because of the tiny production 
run.

PLEASANT LINE AIMED AT GIRLS WHO WANT TO GET ALL DOLLED UP 
</P>

<P>
To outfit little girls with fantasy wear, Pleasant T. Rowland has the most 
imaginative concept going. Rowland, a Wisconsin entrepreneur, author and former 
teacher, started her Middleton, Wis. firm, Pleasant Co., in September, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
As part of her business she included an American Girls Collection of clothes 
for girls ages 7 to 10, with matching outfits for dolls. All the clothes and 
doll costumes are inspired by the make-believe characters in the accompanying, 
American Girls storybooks that Pleasant publishes. Clothes, dolls and books are 
available by mail order only. 
</P>
<P>
The storybook characters are the old-fashioned kind. No bionic women or road 
warriors here. There is Kirsten Larson, a fictional, Scandinavian girl who 
settles on the American frontier of 1854. She wears country dresses and woolly 
separates that keep her warm on chilly Minnesota mornings. Samantha Parkington, 
an orphan who lives with her wealthy grandmother, has oodles of fancy party and 
day dresses for her activities at Miss Crampton's Academy. The scheming, 
dreaming Molly McIntire, who lives with her mother while her father fights in 
World War II, rounds out the collection of characters, with her all-American 
girl, plaid jumpers, her pj's and raincoats. 
</P>
<P>
Most outfits are available in girls sizes 6x to 16 and range in price from $45 
to $175. The dolls, dressed like various characters, are priced from about $75 
and sold with their own, personal storybook. Their clothes are priced at about 
$16 to $42, with patterns available at $10 each, for home sewers. And there 
seems to be a market for it. Business has more than doubled each year since the 
company was formed, says Tamara Hauck, vice president of marketing and product 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"Little girls are looking to emulate someone, and these characters can be used 
as role models," Hauck says of Kirsten, Samantha and Molly. "The characters 
stand for solid American values such as courage, determination, familial love 
and the rewards of friendship." Hauck contrasts these ideals to the life styles 
represented by typical "fashion" dolls, such as Barbie. "They have sports cars, 
dream houses and other material things," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
Fashions for her storybook dolls and for little girls are all conceptualized by 
Rowland and made of fabrics designed in-house. Cotton twill, taffeta, velvet 
and wool are staple fabrics for clothes, flame-retardant polyester and nylon 
fabrics are used for sleep wear. 
</P>
<P>
Extensive historical research goes into the outfits, most of which (except 
perhaps the prairie dresses) are classics, meant to blend with clothes already 
in a girl's wardrobe. A case in point: the Scandinavian ensemble of woolens are 
hand-knit in black and white yarns to create a Scandinavian pattern indicative 
of those worn at the turn of the century in character Kirsten's native country. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the line are some elaborate accessories for dolls and girls. A 
girl-sized sheared rabbit-fur muff and hat is re-created for Samantha in white 
faux fur. The World War II doll, Molly, has a tiny, monogrammed handkerchief 
containing an authentic 1943 steel penny used during the war when copper was in 
short supply. Some dolls even have paper dolls to play with. 
</P>
<P>
But the accompanying books seem to be Rowland's pride. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no accident that the dolls are sold only with the purchase of a book -- 
they are not available separately," says Hauck. "One of the objectives is to 
encourage young girls to read and to learn about history." 
</P>
<P>
The American Girls Collection of dolls and fashions are available through mail 
order only. To obtain a catalogue call (800) 845-0005.

THE LITTLE SHOP OF PRESTIGIOUS PARODIES IN BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN, Goodwin, a free-lance writer, regularly contributes to The 
Times fashion pages.

<TEXT>
<P>
The newest European designer to set up shop in Beverly Hills has a sense of 
humor. Prada, the fine Milanese leather and ready-to-wear company which opened 
a narrow, elegant store on Brighton Way, sells a spoof of the famous, French, 
quilted Chanel handbag. Prada's is made of industrial nylon, with gold chain 
handles intact, and it's large enough to hold a week's groceries. 
</P>
<P>
"Chanel sent us congratulations," attests Patrizio Bertelli, who runs the 
family-owned company with his wife Miuccia BianchiPrada, great-granddaughter of 
the founder. They liked the idea of such a big carry-all with chain shoulder 
straps, he says. The bag, now 4 years old, and all its variations (priced from 
$200 to $500), have become a status symbol for fashion-minded working women, 
particularly New York fashion editors who stuff them with press kits, 
notebooks, sweats and running shoes. 
</P>
<P>
The fashion parodies don't stop there. The newest nylon bags come beaded as if 
they were fine satin and are meant to be carried in the day or evening. 
T-shirts feature the Prada logo sewn in tiny 'caviar' beads. There are also 
crocodile bracelets, or rather, watch straps without the watch; beaded suede 
pouches, and handbags made of nylon and leather combinations. Even the store 
fixtures, also designed by the company, require a second look. Display cases 
and storage units are made of textured bronze with leather handles, and chairs 
and couches are slip-covered in French iridescent taffeta. 
</P>
<P>
The Prada customer, says Bertelli, likes 'contradictions,' although for the 
more serious customer there is a full line of crocodile goods. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Prada was a sleepy, if prestigious handbag shop that catered to the 
Italian royal family until Bertelli entered the picture 11 years ago. He was a 
successful leather goods manufacturer in Tuscany near Florence when Miuccia 
Prada, who ran her company's sole shop in Milan, said, "Let's do business." 
</P>
<P>
"When they met it was like an explosion," says Judy Brand Leaf, a devoted 
customer who lives in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Three years after Bertelli and Prada met, they introduced shoes, and a year 
later opened a second store in Milan, followed by shops in Paris, Madrid and 
New York. (They were married two years ago, but engaged for eight.) Now there 
are 10 Prada shops worldwide, plus a separate franchise of 10 boutiques in the 
Orient.

TEEN-AGE JAPANESE FASHION TAKES CUES FROM MOVIES 
</P>

<P>
From 3 o'clock on, they have the run of the place. Japanese teen-agers, some 
still dressed in conservative school uniforms, take over Takeshita-dori, a 
walkers-only area in the city's Harajuku district. 
</P>
<P>
The street itself is as irregular as a paved cow path. There is nothing 
straight-edged or methodical about it. The stores look like open-face garages, 
one hooked to another. What they carry isn't all that different from the 
inexpensive T-shirts, hats and eccentric accessories seen along the Venice 
Boardwalk. And the tiny houses sandwiched between the shops are like Venice 
houses, except for the pagoda-style roofs. 
</P>
<P>
The regulars on the street refer to the most popular Takeshita-dori stores as 
"singer-shops" because they are owned by Japanese pop musicians who put their 
name on the clothing labels. Other stores have English language names -- "Each 
Other" and "Gothic Hair," for example. 
</P>
<P>
You might bump into some big names from the West while you're browsing. British 
born, Milan-based designers Keith Varty and Alan Cleaver of Byblos toured the 
street between last week's ( fashion shows and seminars for "fashion summit 
'90," a week-long meeting in Tokyo of designers from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised everybody looks so, sweet, I guess is the word," Varty said of 
the dress styles of the young people he saw in Takeshita-dori. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet as in Ralph Lauren-like, country sentimental. Denim is the common 
denominator. Girls wear denim work shirts under big, floppy cardigan sweaters 
and long, graceful skirts, or jeans jackets and denim skirts with authentic 
Indian moccasins. Boys wear varsity jackets with their jeans. Jeans jackets 
topped by wilder, leopard-print styles, and sunglasses, berets and jeans are 
other looks. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of years ago they wanted slick Italian suits, now they want casual 
denims," notes Shinji Yokoi, who was raised in Tokyo but now lives in Los 
Angeles. A project supervisor for Dentsu, L.A., a division of the Tokyo 
advertising agency known for the life style research it conducts, Yokoi says 
Americans flatter themselves believing that denim dressing is an homage to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Japanese don't make a distinction between English, American or French," 
he says. "They think western, not necessarily American." 
</P>
<P>
For new fashion trends, he says, Tokyo's teens scour American and European 
movies, which they rent and watch on their VCRs. "Bat Man" and "Ghost Busters 
II" are the red hot titles right now. No shortage of interesting fashion ideas 
there.

SHAPING UP IN ADVANCE FOR SKIING; 
</P>
<P>
EXERCISE: SKIERS CAN CONDITION THEMSELVES FOR THEIR SPORT THROUGH A PROGRAM 
THAT COMBINES AEROBICS, ANAEROBIC WORKOUTS AND CALISTHENICS.

Being in good physical condition helps reduce the chance of injury or accident 
and makes it easier to improve your skiing skills. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever exercise program you follow, begin with plenty of easy stretching. And 
if you're over 35, consult a doctor before beginning any exercise program. 
</P>
<P>
Skiers who want to be in optimum condition should follow a program that 
combines aerobic and anaerobic workouts with calisthenics. Aerobic exercise 
builds up the cardiovascular system for better endurance; anaerobic exercise 
helps oxygen-starved muscles perform well. 
</P>
<P>
For the best results, build your exercise program on a firm aerobic foundation. 
Swimming, bicycling, hiking or running are all good routes to an improved 
cardiovascular system. 
</P>
<P>
Runners can help develop ski-specific skills by making frequent turns, by 
crossing over an imaginary line between their legs with every stride, or by 
running sideways or backward. 
</P>
<P>
Cycling and swimming are especially worthwhile; both build strength and aerobic 
conditioning without putting undue stress on joints and ligaments. Mountain 
biking in particular is a good workout for skiers; it helps build strong leg 
muscles. To increase your aerobic capacity, aim for workouts of long duration 
but of only moderate intensity. For noticeable results, plan at least three 
20-minute exercise sessions each week. 
</P>
<P>
Anaerobic conditioning is important for skiers, too, otherwise you won't be 
able to carve those turns when a long run takes your wind away. Stick to the 
same exercises recommended for aerobic training, but increase intensity and 
decrease duration. 
</P>
<P>
Once you're through with these basics, more esoteric exercises can give leg 
muscles the same kind of torture a ski slope would.

DANNEMEYER SAYS AMA'S POLICY ON AIDS BOOSTS HIS LEGISLATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The American Medical Assn.'s recent endorsement of a new reporting policy for 
those infected with the AIDS virus represents a "180-degree turn" and a strong 
boost for similar legislative proposals, Rep. William E. Dannemeyer said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"It is gratifying to have as an ally in this struggle the voice of organized 
medicine in America, the American Medical Assn.," said Dannemeyer 
(R-Fullerton), who has introduced legislation making reporting mandatory. "AMA 
policy is now entirely consistent with the provisions of my own legislation," 
he said at a Capitol Hill press conference. 
</P>
<P>
At its annual convention in Hawaii last week, the AMA formally adopted a report 
that calls on states to adopt policies requiring physicians to report in 
confidence to public health agencies the names of patients who test positive 
for the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the AMA said public health agencies should establish systems to 
trace the sexual or drug-using partners of those infected with HIV, just as 
they do for those infected with other sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Previous AMA policy had urged reliance on educational programs to prevent the 
spread of the deadly virus. 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory reporting is still strongly opposed by many public health officials 
as well as gay-rights activists, who argue that the fear of discrimination 
drives underground those potential HIV carriers who are most in need of testing 
and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"The available studies on this question have indicated that reporting is a bad 
idea because it does, in fact, stop people from coming in for testing," said 
Thomas B. Stoddard, executive director of the Lambda Legal Defense and 
Education Fund, the nation's largest gay and lesbian civil rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
The shift in AMA policy, Stoddard said, represents the beginning of a 
disturbing split between medical doctors and public health officials. "The 
public health community by and large still believes that coercive and 
instrusive measures will be counterproductive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the AMA's action, Stoddard said Dannemeyer "can now beat his 
drum more loudly, but he is still wrong as a matter of policy." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer last summer introduced in the House of Representatives a bill that 
would withhold federal funds from states that do not require clinics and 
doctors to confidentially report the names of HIV-positive patients to public 
health officials. The legislation also would require health authorities to 
identify and contact sexual partners of those reported to be infected. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation has languished in the House Energy and Commerce Committee's 
energy and environment subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los 
Angeles), a liberal who has championed homosexual rights. A strong opponent of 
mandatory reporting, Waxman is almost certain to keep the Dannemeyer bill 
bottled up in committee. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dannemeyer said the credibility that the AMA has brought to his views 
will make it easier for other members of Congress to support him if his 
proposals are ever brought before the House. 
</P>
<P>
In one scenario, Dannemeyer said he might offer parts of his bill as amendments 
to AIDS legislation introduced in the Senate, where rules governing the 
amendment process are more liberal.

CAMPBELL EXPECTED TO QUIT SENATE SEAT TODAY;

<TEXT>
<P>
Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) has moved up his timetable to resign 
from the state Senate and intends to step down today instead of early next 
year, sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members serving Campbell's office and his legislative committees were 
informed individually about the hastened departure Thursday. It was unclear 
what prompted Campbell to speed up his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
The senator and his chief assistant, Jerome Haleva, were unavailable for 
comment Thursday. Senate sources said they had been told privately of the 
decision. Campbell, 54, shocked his colleagues in late October when he 
announced that he would leave elective office after 20 years to become 
president of the California Manufacturers Assn., a major trade group with 
extensive lobbying operations in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, Campbell said he intended to stay on until early January, in part 
to finish up his legislative agenda and to pick the timing for a special 
election to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
But his decision was lambasted by California Common Cause as a "serious 
conflict of interest," and the public interest group criticized him last week 
for taking a "junket" when he led a handful of legislative colleagues to New 
York City to meet with bond houses. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, as chief of a joint legislative budget committee, scheduled as part 
of the official duties a tour of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He and the 
legislators also paid calls on some corporate executives, who treated them to 
dinners, including one at the exclusive 21 Club, and free tickets to Broadway 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp's office is wrapping up a lengthy investigation 
into payments made to Campbell's wife during a 1987 conference on women 
sponsored by the senator's office. 
</P>
<P>
The probe began in 1988 after newspaper articles disclosed that the 1987 event 
paid $165,000 in consulting fees to a firm owned by Margene Campbell and Karen 
L. Smith, a former aide who left Campbell's staff earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very optimistic that we'll resolve the matter no later than the end of the 
year," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Yeoryios Apallas, adding that he and his staff 
have examined more than 20,000 documents in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
When Campbell officially resigns, Gov. George Deukmejian has 14 days in which 
to call a special election to fill the Senate seat. The district covers the 
Orange County communities of El Toro, Brea, Placentia, Mission Viejo, Irvine, 
Yorba Linda, Lake Forest, Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel and Silverado.

SOVIET LOOK AT SDI DRAWS INTEREST, IRE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 2,770-acre Capistrano Test Site in South Orange County doesn't look like 
much from the front gate, and it doesn't attract much attention from its 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Nestled in the dry hills above San Clemente, the TRW Inc. facility houses a 
$250-million laser research project, part of the nation's so-called "Star Wars" 
defense, but it is closed to the public, and no signs on the exterior of the 
site give any hint about the work going on inside. Residents of the laid-back 
beach community just a few miles away appear to know little if anything about 
it, and local law enforcement officials say they rarely concern themselves with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"That place is pretty quiet as far as we're concerned," said Lt. Richard J. 
Olson of the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
But the same facility that draws little public notice in Orange County has 
stirred interest and concern in the upper reaches of the Kremlin, where 
American high-energy laser research never fails to ruffle feathers. 
</P>
<P>
After months of discussion, 10 Soviet scientists -- led by Ambassador Yuri 
Nazarkin, head of the Soviet delegation to the strategic arms and space defense 
talks in Geneva -- will visit the Orange County lab Saturday, escorted by 
company executives and U.S. government officials. There the Soviets will get a 
look at the "Alpha laser," and it will mark the first time Soviet officials 
have ever laid eyes on a Strategic Defense Initiative project. 
</P>
<P>
American officials say that Soviet scientists picked the sprawling Orange 
County facility as one of only two to visit in this country -- the other, Los 
Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, is well-known to laymen and 
physicists alike. 
</P>
<P>
When they arrive, the Soviets will suit up in sterile "bunny suits" and climb 
inside a 50-foot-tall vacuum chamber to behold a hydrogen fluoride, high-power 
chemical laser, the kind of equipment that science fiction writers like to 
weave into their tales. But while the laser may be the stuff of fiction and 
fantasy, physicists say it's not much to look at. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big mess," said John Pike, associate director for space policy of the 
Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. "It looks like what you see 
in your car when you open up the hood." 
</P>
<P>
Herbert York, a physicist at UC San Diego, who served as chief negotiator in 
the U.S.-Soviet test ban talks from 1978 to 1980, agreed that the Soviets may 
not be rendered breathless by their glimpse of the laser. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a modest-sized building, and an elegant, high-tech laser, but it's 
nothing that's that impressive," he said, adding that he has visited the 
facility on several occasions to examine the Alpha laser. "I'm really surprised 
that they would choose the San Juan facility to visit." 
</P>
<P>
York, who heard of the Soviet visit several weeks ago, said that he first 
thought U.S. officials must have picked the TRW facility because they did not 
want the scientists to see more advanced research being conducted at other 
laboratories, including the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory near 
Berkeley. That center is testing space-based "kinetic kill" systems, also known 
as "brilliant pebbles." 
</P>
<P>
TRW officials will not discuss the visit in detail, and most of the 2 1/2-half 
day trip is out of public view. The Soviet team will arrive at the Marine Corps 
Air Station in El Toro this afternoon and, after a brief session for reporters 
and photographers, will drop out of sight for two days. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente officials complained that they did not learn of the visit until 
reading of it in the newspaper, and other local officials said they, too, have 
been kept in the dark. A Marine Corps spokesman said he has been given an 
itinerary but would not release it except to confirm the arrival time and the 
Saturday visit to the facility. The Soviets will be "in the area" Sunday, 
officials acknowledged, but they declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Strategic Defense Initiative Organization at the Pentagon 
referred questions to TRW and the State Department, which referred them back to 
the SDIO. Montye C. Male, a spokeswoman for TRW, called the tour a 
"government-to-government event. We'll provide whatever we're asked to provide, 
but we really are, by design, keeping a low profile on this." 
</P>
<P>
Local reaction to the visit was less muddled. 
</P>
<P>
In San Clemente, which was founded by a staunch anti-communist who sought 
refuge from the the Bolshevik movement of the 1920s, the spirit of glasnost 
echoed in the remarks of residents and merchants along the waterfront and in 
the quaint shopping centers of the 71-year-old beach community. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it is a bad idea to have more communication between the two 
countries, said Sandy Bushfield, owner of a pier-side sandwich shop. "I'm for 
(the visit) if it makes the world a better place to live in. If we can all work 
together and learn to live with one another, we can save mankind." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Barron, a 21-year-old construction worker, said he has been heartened 
by events in Eastern Europe and the spirit of openness. "In fact, I am pretty 
happy with the way things are going with the Russians," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Barron, along with several scientists and local officials, said he was 
puzzled and annoyed by the secrecy surrounding the trip. The laser is not 
classified, and once the TRW lab opens its doors to Soviet officials, many 
asked, from whom are the secrets being kept? 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Thomas Lorch, who opposed the visit, complained about what he 
considers the federal government's double standard: "The local people are not 
allowed to visit and be allowed to be briefed on the operation of the facility, 
but the Russians can come out and get the red carpet treatment, so to speak," 
Lorch said. "This takes me aback." 
</P>
<P>
TRW officials maintained their silence: "We at TRW have a standing policy of no 
media involvement," Male said. "We have maintained a closed facility." 
</P>
<P>
That policy will stand. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it outrageous but not at all surprising," Pike said. "You'd be 
surprised at how much information is shared between the U.S. and Soviet 
governments that is not shared with the American people. . . . It's weird." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ALL ABOUT ALPHA 
</P>
<P>
Alpha, a high-energy chemical laser under development by TRW Space and 
Technology Group for the Air Force Weapons Laboratory, is a $250-million 
project being undertaken as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative. Here are 
some facts about program: 
</P>
<P>
The laser was designed from 1980-83 at a cost of $50 million. Construction 
began in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
A four-phase test program now under way will measure power, beam quality and 
other aspects of the laser. 
</P>
<P>
The laser is made primarily of extruded aluminum. It derives its beam from a 
chemical reaction. The fuels used to ignite Alpha are nitrogen fluoride, 
deuterium, hydrogen and helium. 
</P>
<P>
Alpha is now being assembled and tested under the guidance of Weapons 
Laboratory officials at the TRW Corp.'s test site near San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
The first test in a four-phase series was in August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The first partial firing was Dec. 23, 1987. Further tests are scheduled for the 
next few months.

<P>
Three Southern California counties and the U.S. Army formalized an agreement 
Thursday that clears the way for the construction of flood-control barriers 
along the Santa Ana River, with Orange County being the major beneficiary of 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties and the Army Corps of Engineers 
will share the cost of the $1.1-billion project to improve flood control along 
the river that authorities say has the worst potential flood problems west of 
the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
In October, $20 million in federal funds were authorized to initiate the 
project. The agreement says that each year the federal government will 
appropriate additional funds until the project is completed. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of Orange County need to realize how important this project is and 
how devastated the county will be, with the loss of life and structural damage, 
if a flood does occur," said Costa Mesa Mayor Peter Buffa, who is chairman of 
the Santa Ana River Flood Protection Agency. "It's just hard to picture it 
right now because the river is dry." 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana River project includes the construction of a new dam, to be 
called "Seven Oaks," four miles upstream from Mentone in San Bernardino County; 
raising Prado Dam in Riverside County by 30 feet to expand its capacity from 
195,000 to 363,000 acre-feet; widening and deepening channels along the lower 
river through Orange County and those along Santiago Creek, and the 
construction of a drain in Corona. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the project will enhance and preserve marshland and wetlands for 
endangered waterfowl, fish and wildlife species at the mouth of the river, 
according to William Zaun, Orange County's director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County, which will be the major beneficiary of the massive project, will 
pay the major share of the local costs, estimated at more than $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
The river extends from the San Bernardino Mountains to its mouth at Huntington 
Beach. STEPHEN C. CHAVEZ

FIREWORKS RECEIVE 4TH OF JULY REPRIEVE

<TEXT>
<P>
Fireworks will be legal in Westminster during next year's Fourth of July, 
regardless of the outcome of a June referendum. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 4 to 1 this week to place the referendum on the June, 
1990, ballot to let voters decide whether fireworks should be banned in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
They also voted that the ban, if approved, would not go into effect until next 
August, so that organizations selling fireworks could do so one last time. 
</P>
<P>
The council had the option of calling for a special election in March, which 
would have cost about $38,000, or placing the issue on the ballot during a 
primary or general election at a cost of about $13,000. 
</P>
<P>
The referendum is the result of efforts made by a citizens group that collected 
the 3,734 signatures needed to qualify the referendum for the ballot. The group 
began collecting the signatures after the council approved a fireworks-banning 
ordinance on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
The council rescinded the ordinance on Nov. 28 to place the issue before the 
voters. GREG HERNANDEZ

Mays said he thinks that Hutton has now made the charges public to retaliate 
for an unfavorable report about her written by City Administrator Paul Cook. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think it's gotten into a political vendetta against Paul Cook," the 
mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
Mays said the clash between Cook and Hutton goes back about a month when Hutton 
unexpectedly presented to a closed-door meeting of the City Council documents 
questioning the legality of about $1.1 million in city purchases. Hutton's 
questions largely concerned lack of competitive bids for some city 
redevelopment items, including about $625,000 in municipal purchases of mobile 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
The mobile homes are to replace ones for residents moved from a mobile home 
park at Pacific Coast Highway near Huntington Street -- an area being 
redeveloped into new hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said Thursday that the city followed routine procedures, "the same as when 
you're purchasing vehicles or a piece of equipment," when it bought the mobile 
homes without bids. He said the city violated no law when it arranged for 
non-bid purchases of the other equipment and material questioned by Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
Cook and Mays both said the City Council, after hearing Cook's explanations of 
the purchases, found nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't think there was any problem, but then the Daily Pilot last week had 
a story about Paul Cook's criticism of Gail Hutton in a confidential report, 
and she got very excited about that," Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
Mays referred to a confidential report that Cook wrote, at the request of the 
council, giving his view of all city departments. A copy of that report was 
leaked to the Daily Pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Mays said he talked to Hutton the day after the newspaper published the story 
about Cook's criticism of her office. Mays said Hutton was upset and "she said 
she was going to go forward with the report (questioning city spending)." Mays 
added: "Obviously her office leaked that report to the press." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Atty. Robert Sangster said Hutton has not decided whether to 
refer her accusations about city purchasing procedures to the county grand 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
"That's an option," Sangster said. "Another option is to simply revise the 
purchasing procedures." 
</P>
<P>
Sangster said Hutton was home ill Thursday and could not respond to phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no feud," Sangster said. "What we have here are two public officials 
(Hutton and Cook), each with his or her own charter duties to perform. It is 
not in any way, shape or form a personal feud." 
</P>
<P>
Cook also denied any personal hostility to Hutton. But he acknowledged that he 
has criticized how her office operates, being especially critical of delays in 
processing paper work needed by other city departments. BILL BILLITER

<P>
LOTTO WINNER'S LUCK RUBS OFF ON COUPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This Christmas, somewhere in Orange County -- presumably Santa Ana -- someone 
won't have to pout, and won't have to cry, but he or she will probably shout. 
Want to know why? 
</P>
<P>
Santa Claus is coming to town -- with $10.1 million in his sack. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, one lucky person walked into a Santa Ana liquor store and 
selected the numbers 30, 49, 3, 24, 47 and 46 for Wednesday night's Lotto 
drawing. Whoever it was didn't know it at the time, but that person walked out 
with more than $10 million to spend on Christmas gifts. Or anything else, for 
that matter. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known who hit the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
The winner, the first ever to pick six of six numbers at a Santa Ana Lotto 
outlet, did not come forward to claim the mega-prize Thursday, said state 
lottery spokesman John Schade. 
</P>
<P>
Another winner of sorts will also have a very merry Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
June Park, co-owner with her husband of the Santa Liquor Mart and Deli at 652 
S. Harbor Blvd., was $50,500 wealthier Thursday just for selling the winning 
ticket to the state's newest millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
In her neat, well-stocked shop, Park was so giddy that in trying to introduce 
her husband, she said, "Um, um, James Park -- I'm so excited, I forgot my 
husband's name!" 
</P>
<P>
For the Parks, both 32, the jackpot was the culmination of the American dream. 
</P>
<P>
They both arrived in the United States about 15 years ago, June from Seoul, 
South Korea, and James, who is also of Korean descent, from Sao Paulo, Brazil. 
They scrimped and saved and scraped together enough money to open their 
business 2 1/2 years ago, and they bought a home in Hacienda Heights. 
</P>
<P>
"I just sold my home last Sunday night," June Park said. "We were deciding on 
where to buy a new house. That's why the timing was so great." 
</P>
<P>
Park said she and her husband will use the windfall to place a down payment on 
a new, bigger home, for themselves and their two children, Natalie, 10, and 
Alexander, 4. 
</P>
<P>
She also said she will share some of the Lotto loot with her employees. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to those practical and charitable plans, Park, like all people with 
"found money," may not be able to resist a splurge. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I'll throw a party," she said. TONY MARCANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; 
</P>
<P>
MAN CLEARED IN TEST OF DAYWORKER LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Costa Mesa man was found innocent Thursday of violating the city's year-old 
dayworker ordinance, marking the first setback in the city's controversial bid 
to restrict curbside hiring of workers. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Municipal Court Commissioner Robert H. Gallivan ruled that the 
city failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant Jose Garcia 
Quintana had violated the ordinance, which prohibits the hiring of people off 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Violations are an infraction under the city's municipal code and carry a $100 
fine for a first offense. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the ordinance charge that it is being selectively used against Costa 
Mesa's immigrant population. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Steven J. Brewer -- a Tustin divorce lawyer who offered to 
defend Quintana after reading about his arrest -- applauded the ruling but said 
he doubted the city would stop enforcing the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"They picked the wrong case to try," Brewer said. "But I don't think this will 
dissuade the city from pursuing these arrests, not unless they are forced into 
court to prove each case." 
</P>
<P>
Quintana, 31, and 15 other Latino men were arrested during a police sweep of 
suspected dayworkers at Lions Park on Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests were videotaped from an unmarked police van parked across the 
street from the park, and the tape was introduced as evidence at Thursday's 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
City attorneys had sought to prove that Quintana was among a group of men who 
approached a pickup truck driven by a police officer who was masquerading as a 
construction boss. The police officer, William Ellwood, alleged that Quintana 
yelled the Spanish word trabajo, which means work, and gestured with his hand 
to indicate his expected hourly wage. 
</P>
<P>
Quintana, testifying on his own behalf, admitted being in the park to visit 
friends, but he said he approached the truck only to hear the conversation 
between the undercover officer and several other men. He said he had no 
intention of soliciting work. 
</P>
<P>
Quintana also testified that he told his friends he suspected that the pickup 
truck contained an undercover policeman. 
</P>
<P>
Gallivan ruled that the videotape was confusing and at best inconclusive, and 
that there was enough doubt to exonerate Quintana. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa Deputy City Atty. Jerry Scheer said Thursday's defeat would not 
cause the city to re-evaluate the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied the process is working and in a sense encouraged by the court 
today, because it indicates that the judicial system and the city's ordinance 
work in tandem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a related proceeding Thursday, an employer, Barnes Cooper, pleaded guilty to 
hiring a worker off the street and illegal parking near Lions Park, also on 
Sept. 14. Cooper was fined $250. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's attorney, Cathy Jensen, said her client pleaded guilty because he 
could not afford to spend several days in court away from his job. 
</P>
<P>
The most controversial part of the ordinance singles out three areas of the 
city -- Lions Park, 18th Street and Harbor Boulevard and Santa Ana Avenue and 
East 20th Street -- and prohibits anyone from being at those sites with the 
"intent" to solicit employment from people in a motor vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
According to the ordinance, police can arrest suspects based on circumstantial 
evidence, even if they are not able to catch violators in the act. 
</P>
<P>
Another provision of the ordinance aimed at both workers and employers bans 
curbside soliciting throughout the city. It is this provision under which 
Quintana was cited. CARLA RIVERA

NURSING CARE FOR BOY TO BE EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jason Goldberg, a 9-year-old quadriplegic who was in danger of losing the 
round-the-clock home care he needs, has won a guarantee of continued care for a 
few more months, the family's lawyer said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Development Disabilities Center has agreed to continue 
nursing care for Jason 16 hours a day, said attorney Catherine Blakemore. 
Jason's mother, a registered nurse, takes over the other eight hours of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Jason, who is blind, deaf, retarded and afflicted with cerebral palsy, must 
breathe medicines and have his chest pounded five times a day to keep his lungs 
clear. He must be repositioned in bed regularly. 
</P>
<P>
Jason's parents, Russ and Monica Goldberg, sued the center last month to force 
the agency to continue the 16-hour-a-day nursing it has provided since the 
family moved to Orange County from Culver City in October. The center contended 
that it could not afford to keep up the care and offered 32 hours a month 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge ordered the center to continue the 16-hour-a-day care 
until a hearing today. But in the meantime, the agency agreed to maintain the 
nursing care until a full hearing can be held on the dispute, Blakemore said. 
That hearing will probably not be scheduled until March, 1990, she said.

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE DIES IN CAR ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Brea-Olinda High School junior and varsity football player was killed 
Wednesday night when his car failed to negotiate a curve on Carbon Canyon Road 
and landed at the base of a 10-foot embankment, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Arredondo, 17, of Brea had left the home of his girlfriend in the Olinda 
Village area of the city about 11 p.m. Wednesday night and was heading home 
when the accident occurred. The coroner's office and the Brea police are 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us that he was not wearing his seat belt and was thrown from the 
car," said Gordon Biccum, the victim's grandfather. "He was probably killed 
instantly. There were no witnesses, so we are just guessing what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Family members reported the youth missing about 5 a.m. Thursday morning. Brea 
police found the wreckage of Arredondo's Acura Integra about two hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Arredondo had moved to Brea with his family from Portland, Ore., about 18 
months ago, Biccum said. 
</P>
<P>
At Brea-Olinda High School on Thursday, students and teachers mourned the death 
of Arredondo, who played center and linebacker on the varsity football team 
this year and was also a member of the track team. School Principal Gerry Goff 
said psychologists were available throughout the day to talk with students 
about the death of their classmate. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a lot of friends and supporters," Goff said. "A number of the students 
felt they couldn't stay at school for the rest of the day after hearing the 
news. It's been a sad day for us here." Members of the school's football team 
were called out of their classes into another room and told together about 
their teammate's death. 
</P>
<P>
"He was really just a great guy," said teammate Mark Hales, who left school 
early after hearing the news. "He lived life to the fullest for the short time 
he had." -- ALLISON SAMUELS

ELDERLY MAN KILLED IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 77-year-old Costa Mesa man died Thursday in a major collision that tied up 
traffic for more than three hours on MacArthur Boulevard in Irvine, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Marvin Arthur Tunstall, was driving south on MacArthur in the right 
lane about 12:57 p.m. when he attempted to make a U-turn about 500 feet south 
of Bison, Police Sgt. Ron Flathers said. As he turned across the path of 
traffic, his 1985 Ford Escort was struck broadside at the driver's door by a 
1984 Chevrolet Suburban driven by Joni Deatherage, 27, of El Toro, Flathers 
said. Deatherage braked but was unable to avoid the collision, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tunstall's car was shoved across the northbound lanes of traffic and came to 
rest at the curb. He suffered head and chest injuries and was pronounced dead 
at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Although Deatherage's car drove through a chain-link fence and plunged to the 
bottom of a 30-foot embankment, both she and her 21-month-old son, strapped 
into a car seat, escaped major injury. They were taken to Hoag Hospital in 
Newport Beach, treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
Officials closed MacArthur to traffic until 4:30 p.m., causing congestion 
throughout the afternoon.

MIKE PENNER: THIS TIME, MURPHY MAY SAY GOODBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You can tell by the couch in the Cal State Fullerton Football House that it's 
almost time for Gene Murphy to go. 
</P>
<P>
On that couch, sawing logs alongside the game films and the playbooks, is Jim 
Chaney, who coaches Cal State Fullerton wide receivers and coordinates Titan 
recruiting. Chaney recently sold his Montclair condo and thought about moving 
into an apartment until Gene Murphy Across America got cranked up again. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy to Las Vegas. Murphy to Utah. Murphy to Fresno State. With the rumors 
flying, Chaney decided it best to shack up in the coaches' shack until Murphy 
lands somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
No sense moving twice. 
</P>
<P>
Around the Fullerton athletic department, the joke is that Christmas shopping 
for Murphy should be easy this year. Just get him a red coat. That way, Murphy 
could pick any campus he likes -- UNLV, Utah or Fresno -- and not clash with 
the school colors. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy has an interview lined up next week in Las Vegas. He has already met 
with Utah athletic director Chris Hill. And Fresno expects to have a head 
coaching vacancy if and when Jim Sweeney departs for the Phoenix Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy's chances? 
</P>
<P>
At UNLV, he is officially one of six finalists but, in truth, he's probably 
reached the championship round. UNLV's 17-member selection committee is 
impressed with the job Murphy has done with Cal State Fullerton resources -- 
you can find better resources on most Las Vegas casino tables -- but also likes 
Houston offensive coordinator John Jenkins. Jenkins choreographed the 
run-and-shoot attack that brought Andre Ware the Heisman and the very thought 
of Runnin' Rebel football excites many along the Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Utah offered Murphy its head coaching job in 1984, when Murphy bypassed the 
Utes and Oregon State to hold out for the Missouri plum that eventually went to 
Woody Widenhofer. Five years later, Utah has another opening and another 
opportunity to finally get its man. 
</P>
<P>
The Fresno State situation is more complicated, but if Sweeney leaves for the 
NFL, and if Murphy is still available, look for the Red Wave to come rolling 
into Fullerton for a successor. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, 50 and a Titan since 1980, admits to being restless. 
</P>
<P>
"God, I want to win again -- big time," Murphy recently told The Times' Robyn 
Norwood. "That's the only thing. There's nothing wrong with being here; 
everybody has their problems to different degrees. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"(But) we were so close the last two years and just didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
And last year, the Titans didn't do it despite the presence of the school's 
all-time leading passer (Dan Speltz), the school's all-time leading receiver 
(Rocky Palamara) and the nation's second-leading rusher (Mike Pringle). 
</P>
<P>
Next year, all will be gone, along with just about everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Fullerton amassed 4,488 yards in total offense, with passes by Speltz 
and runs by Pringle accounting for 4,398 yards of it. That's 98% of the Titan 
offense, flushed out of Fullerton, just like that. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Deon Thomas will be the Titans' leading returning rusher. He had 101 
yards in 24 carries. Paul Schulte will be the top returning quarterback. He 
completed two of three passes for 24 yards. In all, only four full-time 
starters will return and only one -- guard Shannon Illingworth -- plays 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
And guess where they get to play? 
</P>
<P>
At Auburn. At Mississippi State. At Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Body-bag games, Murphy calls them. Bounty bowls. Killings-for-hire, where the 
gate receipts and the victory margins are usually large and guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
Remember these golden oldies from 1987? LSU 56, Fullerton 12. Florida 65, 
Fullerton 0. Hawaii 44, Fullerton 0. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy can be excused for wishing not to limp through that again. 
</P>
<P>
And, what challenges remain for Murphy at Fullerton? He already has won a 
conference championship and been to the California Bowl. He already has gone 
undefeated, if you include the Las Vegas forfeiture that turned 1984 into a 
12-0 season. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 years, Murphy has accomplished the previously unthinkable: building a 
winning football program at Cal State Apathy, where there is no home stadium, 
no fans and no money. Before Murphy, Fullerton's most recent winning season had 
been 1973, when the Titans played Division II football. Since 1983, Murphy has 
had one .500 season and four winning seasons, including this year's 6-4-1 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton officials will no doubt appeal to Murphy's loyalty and note the 
blueprints for the 13,000-seat, $10.6-million on-campus football facility -- 
a.k.a. the Titans' Holy Grail. Murphy's loyalty is a surer thing than the 
stadium; he once spent 14 years as an assistant at North Dakota -- or about as 
long as Fullerton has been talking about a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Latest word now is that ground breaking is finally set for next spring, with 
the first kickoff scheduled for 1992. Of course, six months ago, that kickoff 
was scheduled for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
A decade of scrounging in the shadow of USC and UCLA is long enough. Any longer 
and you risk decay. Remember what happened to Bobby Dye when he said no to 
Purdue? 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Murphy said no to Utah and Oregon State. Now, he's faced with 
that rarest of prospects, a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
If the offer does come, don't expect any misdirection from Murphy this time 
around. If the offer comes, color Murphy gone. 
</P>
<P>
Or red.

ROHRIG-TITUS SHOWDOWN GOES TO MISSION VIEJO IN SEMIFINALS

<P>
At 6-feet-3, Jennifer Rohrig, Mission Viejo High School's center, isn't used to 
meeting her opposition on even terms. 
</P>
<P>
That changed Thursday night in the semifinals of the Savanna Runnin' Rebel 
basketball tournament, when Rohrig faced Traci Titus, Loara's 6-1 center. 
</P>
<P>
The game provided a showcase for two of the county's taller centers, but that 
contest ended prematurely when Titus left the game early in the fourth quarter 
with a sprained ankle. With Titus out, Rohrig sparked Mission Viejo to a 36-30 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo plays Ocean View, which defeated Redlands, 63-48, in the final at 
7:30 tonight at Savanna. 
</P>
<P>
"Titus getting hurt was psychologically demoralizing," said Loara Coach Gary 
Blate, who had only eight players available. 
</P>
<P>
To add insult to injury, Loara's other post player, Liz Redmen, fouled out in 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
That, coupled with Mission Viejo's press and some key baskets by Diablo guard 
Carrie Burt when Rohrig was on the bench with foul trouble, proved to be the 
difference in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We just broke down," Blate said. "We threw away the ball, and we had less of a 
bench and we got tired." 
</P>
<P>
Before Titus got hurt, she gave Rohrig all she could handle. Titus helped send 
the Mission Viejo senior to the bench with her third personal foul with less 
than three minutes to go in the half. 
</P>
<P>
While Rohrig was on the bench, Loara took its biggest lead, 24-18, on 
back-to-back baskets by Titus two minutes into the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Rohrig returned to score 10 of her team's 12 fourth-quarter points in a 
12-4 run to give Mission Viejo the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Titus scored 13 points on five-of-16 shooting. Rohrig led all scorers with 16 
points on six-of-14 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"I just reacted by fouling," said Rohrig, who along with Mission Viejo Coach 
Steve Asay was feeling lucky to have escaped with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It showed me a little bit that I need to work harder," said Rohrig, a senior. 
Asay said Titus was a good test for his center. 
</P>
<P>
"Titus was strong," Asay said. "She was good. There was a lot of pushing and 
stuff going on and Jennifer didn't react to it as quickly as she should have." 
</P>
<P>
Rohrig will get another chance to pick on someone her own size tonight. Ocean 
View has one of the county's best centers in 6-3 Jenny Sullivan, the most 
valuable player of the Sunset League. 
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal: 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View 63, Redlands 48 -- Sullivan's 28 points and 20 rebounds paced Ocean 
View in a matchup of undefeated teams. Ocean View (5-0) entered the game ranked 
fifth in the state for 5-A schools and Redlands (6-1) was ranked fifth for 5-AA 
schools. Fabiola Nunez had 14 for Ocean View. Tring Swidntek led Redlands with 
11. 
</P>
<P>
In the consolation round: 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 63, Los Alamitos 62 -- Fullerton (6-1) outscored Los Altos, 16-12, in 
the fourth quarter. Sommer McLean had 21 points and Lynn Gilbert had 12 to lead 
Fullerton.

MARINA COMES BACK IN THE FOURTH QUARTER TO TRAP REDLANDS INTO DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marina High School used a 1-3-1 half-court trap defense and good free-throw 
shooting to overcome a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit and defeat Redlands, 
77-73, Thursday in a third-round game of the Irvine World News basketball 
tournament at University High. 
</P>
<P>
Thi Nguyen, who had only five points, hit two free throws to put Marina ahead, 
72-71, with 1 minute 20 seconds to play. Guard Travis Boyd's two free throws 
with 35 seconds left extended the lead to 74-71.

FLUOROCARBON OPTS FOR 'FURON' AS ITS NEW NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LAGUNA NIGUEL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Cantonese it means "the seat of your pants" -- not exactly the image a 
company wants to cultivate. But that did not discourage Fluorocarbon executives 
from choosing Furon for its new corporate name. 
</P>
<P>
"We liked the ring of it," company Chairman and Chief Executive Peter Churm 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Furon was the product of a six-month, worldwide contest in which Fluorocarbon 
offered 100 shares of stock to the person who came up with the winning name for 
this manufacturer of seals and high-performance plastics for industry. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 10,000 contestants actually suggested Furon, but a very similar 
name, Fluron, was suggested by eight people. The company liked Fluron, but 
rejected it when it was discovered that an East Coast competitor used a similar 
name for one of its products. 
</P>
<P>
So the company dropped the L and will award the 100-share prize, worth about 
$1,300, to each of the eight people. Among the winners is Ron Birtcher, a 
partner in the Birtcher development firm in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
The new name officially takes effect Jan. 1, when it will begin to appear on 
Fluorocarbon signs and literature. However, those answering telephones at the 
Laguna Niguel headquarters will start using the new name Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Fluorocarbon decided to change its name to disassociate itself from 
chlorofluorocarbons, the pollutants threatening the ozone layer which have 
nothing to do with the company's business. 
</P>
<P>
Among names given the heave-ho were Fluoroluralura, the Churminators Inc., 
Slick Parts Inc., So Far So Good Co., and Not Chlorofluorocarbon. 
</P>
<P>
But once you get past the easy cuts, selecting a name from thousands of entries 
is no easy task, Churm said. Finding a name that would not be confused with 
another company or product was a major problem, for instance. "We probably 
settled on 15 different names that were already taken," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fluorocarbon spokesman Ron Bissell said Furon cleared an international 
trademark and copyright search 10 days ago. Since then, he said, "Furon 
Company" has been registered in every nation in which the company does 
business. 
</P>
<P>
A last step, Bissell said, was to make certain that furon was not recognized as 
anything obscene or derogatory in another language. Then, he said, came the 
discovery that it means "a stiff underskirt" in Greek, is close to a word 
meaning "carbuncle or boil" in French, and can be translated as "seat of pants" 
in a Chinese dialect. 
</P>
<P>
Bissell said the Cantonese translation does not present a serious flaw. "Most 
people speak English in Hong Kong, where the prospects for business are greater 
for us than in the Canton province of Mainland China." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Fluorocarbon officials are pleased that the name contest not only 
generated interest and publicity around the world but saved the company some 
money. He said the entire cost of Fluorocarbon's name change, including the 
printing of new letterheads and the awards, is about $25,000. By contrast, 
Bissell said, it would have cost the company $100,000 to $250,000 to hire the 
services of a consultant that specializes in creating new corporate names.

Fluorocarbon Earnings Dip: Fluorocarbon Co., the Laguna Niguel manufacturer, 
reported that while third-quarter sales were up 30%, earnings declined 13%. For 
the three months ended Nov. 4, net earnings totaled $2.2 million, compared to 
$2.5 million for the like quarter last year. Sales rose to $82.8 million from 
$63.5 million. Net income for the nine-month period declined 20%, to $6.5 
million from $8.1 million. Last year's figure included a one-time gain of $1 
million on sale of assets. Sales increased 37%, to $252.7 million from $184.3 
million. Peter Churm, chairman of the company, said the results reflected the 
acquisitions of Dixon, CHR and Bunnell, which were completed in February. 
Fluorocarbon manufactures polymer components for a wide range of industrial 
markets.

HAWAIIAN AIRLINES PLANS TO CUT COSTS BY LAYING OFF 200

<P>
Hawaiian Airlines, which has agreed to be taken over by a Newport Beach 
investor group, said it will reduce its work force by about 200 employees after 
Jan. 1, 1990, in order to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian Airlines Chief Executive Officer John Magoon Jr. said Wednesday that 
the layoffs will total just under 7% of the company's total work force and will 
include both full-time and part-time workers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking these steps to reduce operating expenses, create a more efficient 
workplace and improve the airline's competitive position," Magoon said. 
</P>
<P>
The airline's parent company, HAL, has scheduled a stockholder vote in two 
weeks on a takeover bid by an investor group headed by Newport Beach attorney 
J. Thomas Talbot and former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
Magoon said the company hoped that it could rehire many of the workers as the 
airline's operating results improve. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant General Chairman Sam Poomaihealani of the International Assn. of 
Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 141 said the cutbacks are scheduled 
for Jan. 2 and 8 and would involve 200 to 242 employees.

CANON BUSINESS MACHINES TO EXPAND TIJUANA PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Canon Business Machines, a Costa Mesa-based U.S. subsidiary of the Japanese 
electronics giant, said this week that it plans to significantly expand the 
Tijuana manufacturing plant it opened last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Since June, Canon has been manufacturing printed circuit boards and ribbon 
cassettes for electronic typewriters at a 60,000-square-foot facility in a 
business park in the Fundadores district in southern Tijuana. The plant employs 
about 90 people, Canon's director of administration David Shiffman said. 
</P>
<P>
Canon now says it will add 120,000 square feet of plant space by the middle of 
next year and bring its total payroll in Tijuana to more than 220 by the end of 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion will be carried out partly on 3.3 acres Canon recently acquired 
and partly on land it acquired when it made its initial entry into the Tijuana 
maquiladora scene. Shiffman said Canon's experience in Mexico so far has gone 
"very well." 
</P>
<P>
Shiffman said the expansion could lead to Canon assembling completed 
typewriters in Tijuana instead of just components. Canon now makes only one 
model of electronic typewriter for the U.S. market, but may add several models 
in coming years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Doyle, a broker with Coldwell Banker International of San Diego, which 
represented both buyer and seller in the Canon land transaction, said interest 
in maquiladoras on the part of U.S., Japanese and other foreign manufacturers 
has picked up in recent weeks after a slight downturn earlier this year. Doyle 
attributed the decline to political uncertainty in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"The success Canon has had in the first phase is evident in the current 
expansion plans," he said. "It's also a good sign for additional Japanese and 
other offshore investment" in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle said other foreign manufacturers operating plants near Canon's in the 
Fundadores area include Scripto-Tokai, a Japanese manufacturer of disposable 
cigarette lighters; Altus, a U.S. battery manufacturer, and Cast Alloys, a U.S. 
golf-club maker. 
</P>
<P>
Shiffman said the expansion of Canon's Tijuana facility will not negatively 
affect jobs at Canon's Costa Mesa plant. In fact, payroll at the Orange County 
plant has nearly doubled to 390 workers over the past year, he said.

STILL SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE AT CABLE SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: THE ZESTINESS ONCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXHIBITION IS GONE. THE 
INDUSTRY IS TOO LARGE TO BE CONSIDERED THE YOUNG UPSTART ANY LONGER. 
</P>

ANAHEIM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howie Mandel was over at the Showtime exhibit, joking about his days as a 
salesman in Canada. Miss December was autographing photos of herself at the 
Playboy at Night booth while the Comedy Network distributed packages of 
Chuckles candy. 
</P>
<P>
But this was not enough to keep George Opacic of DCA Cablevision, the company 
that provides cable TV to Rancho Cucamonga, from being a little nostalgic about 
the old days of the Western Cable Show. 
</P>
<P>
"All the glitter seems to have gone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was like past shows in most respects: Cable industry executives converged in 
Anaheim this week to check out new cable channels and programs, chew the fat 
with friends and say terrible things about their rivals, the broadcast 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
Across the vast space of the Anaheim Convention Center, exhibitors displayed 
samples of their new shows and handed out pens, breath sprays and keychains 
with their logos on them while trying to sign up buyers. There also were 
exhibitors selling technical equipment to cable system operators. 
</P>
<P>
There were a lot of places where people could win something like a T-shirt by 
throwing a basketball through a hoop. Nonetheless, the zestiness once 
associated with the cable show was gone, a sampling of veterans said. The Wild, 
Wild Western Cable Show it wasn't. The cable industry has grown too big and is 
bringing in revenues too large to be considered the young upstart any longer. 
Serious business was being discussed at the three-day affair, which ends today. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be a million new gimmicks," said Herbert L. Golden of the 
Bankers Trust Company, which lends money to cable companies. "Everything was 
new. It was all exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he says, because of the industry's success, the technical equipment on 
display at the show offers "minor improvments" at best. No more of the 
grandiose breakthroughs that have helped the industry explode. And he noted 
that the mom-and-pop cable operators, who ushered in the cable era running 
small outfits in their local areas, have been "folded into bigger systems." A 
lot of the small operators who sold their companies "are living in Hawaii or 
the Caribbean now," he said. "They made a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Also noticing changes was Stephen Abram, vice president of Wellington-Ross 
Insurance Services, an Encino firm that insures cable companies. "There's a lot 
less flash," he said. "The business is maturing." 
</P>
<P>
As Abram sees it, the layout on the exhibition floor is a reflection of the 
business in general. "There's bigger booths," he said. "And less of them." 
</P>
<P>
The cable operators have been been consolidating, with the smaller companies 
gobbled up by the giants. Meanwhile, a different, but comparable trend has 
marked the programming side, with the biggest entertainment companies adding to 
their menu of cable offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Under one roof at the cable show were MTV, Nickelodeon/Nick at Night, VH-1, the 
forthcoming HA! comedy network, Showtime and The Movie Channel. All are owned 
by Viacom International Inc. Ted Turner oversees the Cable News Network, CNN 
Headline News, Superstation TBS and one-year-old Turner Network Television. 
</P>
<P>
There was a pervasive feeling this year that cable had finally grown up. Cable 
now reaches more than half the TV homes in America. And while the broadcast 
networks' share of viewers has steadily declined in recent years, cable's 
audience share has risen. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the cable show was not exactly a stroll through a widget factory, 
either. The industry still has room for entrepreneurs ready to try something 
different or find an untapped niche. The people trying to launch the Sci-Fi 
Channel were trying to sign up buyers. At the American Movie Classics booth, 
which not only looked like a '50s diner, but actually offered pie, a trio of 
waitresses crooned oldies. 
</P>
<P>
Bravo, the highbrow network, remained true to form, displaying an exhibit of 
modern art. The Weather Channel people showed lots of storm footage on their TV 
monitors. Black Entertainment Television brought in Tim and Daphne Maxwell Reid 
to announce that the channel had purchased reruns of "Frank's Place." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the spirit that made cable what it is today was best exemplified by the 
people at the Prevue Guide. At first reluctant to break their news prematurely, 
they confided quietly, but proudly, that they were now reaching 15 million 
viewers who could turn to their channel at any time -- to find out what was on 
all the other channels.

April Artinger plucked another party dress from a rack filled with taffeta and 
added it to the growing pile cradled in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
"We're having a formal party, and everyone dresses so nice," said the 30-ish 
Huntington Beach woman. 
</P>
<P>
Artinger couldn't help laughing at the idea that she will be greeting her 
stylish guests in a dress she bought for less than $50 at Sutter Place, a 
factory outlet for Jessica McClintock's Victorian-inspired formal wear. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the same stuff they sell in the mall for about $200," Artinger said, 
"but I'm spending about $28. Isn't that funny?" 
</P>
<P>
Glitzy costumes for the holiday season's swanky parties can easily cost $1,000 
or more each, something most party-goers don't find amusing. That's big money, 
especially if you travel in a social circles that require a different ball gown 
for every gala. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Orange County offers plenty of alternatives to costly designer 
dresses, so budget-conscious socialites don't have to empty their Christmas 
accounts for a new dress. 
</P>
<P>
In the Back Room at Loehmann's next to Sutter Place at Loehmann's Five Points 
Plaza in Huntington Beach, party-goers can find evening gowns glittering with 
sequins and rhinestones for $350 to $400, about half their retail prices. Many 
dresses are by top names such as Oleg Cassini, Christian Dior and Anne Klein. 
</P>
<P>
One floor-length sheath with a low V back features an intricate swirl pattern 
of green sequins and beads and a band of silver tube beads around its jewel 
neck; it's $325. A three-piece royal blue silk ensemble for $289 has a 
bead-trimmed jacket and heavily beaded belt to accompany a long dress. For 
less-formal affairs, there's a straight short dress of black sequins dress and 
a white organza ruffle around the neckline for $60. 
</P>
<P>
The discounts at Sutter Place, which also sells overstock of Jessica 
McClintock's Scott McClintock and Gunne Sax lines, range from 50% to 70% off 
retail. 
</P>
<P>
"I get all of the overflow," says Julie Georgeson, manager of Sutter Place. 
"Once the merchandise reaches our floor, it means they're no longer making that 
style. This is the end of the totem pole." 
</P>
<P>
The end is not such a bad place to go. Shoppers can get a tea-length dress with 
a black velvet bustier and a full black lace skirt for $82 rather than $180. 
During one of the store's frequent sales, a dress such as this might sell for 
$41, half the normal discount price. 
</P>
<P>
"We have $300 dresses for $78," Georgeson says. A floor-length black velvet 
skirt was selling for $14 during a recent sale. 
</P>
<P>
"I know people who come from all over Los Angeles to shop here," says Karen 
Noteboom of Huntington Beach, who was toting a sleeveless black velvet frock. 
</P>
<P>
"You can buy a party dress for $25 to $50, wear it once, and you don't mind 
because you're not putting a big investment in it," Noteboom said. 
</P>
<P>
Although fans of McClintock's feminine styles give up certain amenities by 
shopping at the outlet -- things can't be ordered in different sizes or colors 
or be returned -- they do get bargains. 
</P>
<P>
Women who prefer more contemporary clothing at a price find innovative styles 
by California designers at SUO, a new boutique in the Westminster Mall. 
</P>
<P>
"We direct styles to the customer who likes different looks but who's not 
trendy," says Jackie Brooks, general manager and buyer for the two SUO stores 
in Westminster and West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Most ensembles there can be pulled together for less than $500, and the designs 
are unusual enough that it's not likely you'll run into a party guest wearing 
the same outfit -- something that happened to no less than Christie Brinkley 
and Cheryl Tiegs at a big event a couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
For evening, a simple black camisole trimmed with stretch lace and green and 
rust-colored sequins by East Wind Code would dress up any outfit. The tank, 
which is $136, goes well with Kymio's Spanish-style black crepe jacket with a 
cape-size square collar ($204) and wide-legged loose pants ($90). 
</P>
<P>
SUO's dress selection is also distinctive. An elegant black crepe dress by 
Linda Christina with chiffon ruffles on the collar and cascading down the back 
is $172. 
</P>
<P>
"Chiffon is a real strong statement for holiday dressing," Brooks says. "Our 
designers tend to like soft, basic fabrics with a little flow to them." 
</P>
<P>
Party girls who don't mind clothes that cling can find plenty of dresses to fit 
a tight budget. 
</P>
<P>
The Judy's chain, for instance, carries a variety of short fitted tank dresses, 
many embellished with sequins and gold embroidery, for about $50 to $150. 
</P>
<P>
At the South Coast Plaza store in Costa Mesa, a black Lycra number by Radar 
with gold embroidery sells for $60. Another, more elaborately made tank dress 
with black and gold sequins is $144. For a more covered look, there is a 
long-sleeved dress with a full green taffeta skirt and black velvet top stamped 
with red roses for $152. 
</P>
<P>
"People are getting more dressed up this year," says Mindy Powell, manager of 
the store. "At our Christmas party, everybody got decked out." 
</P>
<P>
Previously owned clothes are another alternative. Many a lavish party dress or 
other pricey garment will be worn only once before being turned over to a 
second-hand store. 
</P>
<P>
"The owner of this coat couldn't wear it again among her circuit of friends," 
says Jeannie Quaintance, owner of Rag Street Consignment Apparel in Laguna 
Beach. "She was lucky to wear it twice." 
</P>
<P>
Whoever buys the hand-painted gold silk coat could be even luckier: It 
originally sold for $1,500, and it's now priced at $500. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent trip, a visitor spotted a red crushed velvet blazer for $130, a 
gold lame camisole for $24, a green velvet cropped top and matching straight 
skirt for $49 apiece, and a black sweater decorated with multicolored metallic 
knit bows for $29. If certain pieces don't sell quickly enough, Quaintance will 
add a discount of 20% or more. 
</P>
<P>
"We have extremely dressy things that have been seen in all of the best 
places," she says. Rag Street also carries samples of new items from 29 
designers and manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
One of these, a peplum jacket in black pleated crepe with a matching tea-length 
skirt by Kathy Hoshijo would retail for $420 but is only $175 at Rag Street, 
she said. The silk fuchsia scarf to go with it is $35. 
</P>
<P>
"Kathy's gown can go anywhere -- to a formal, to the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center or to the White House -- and be smashing," Quaintance says. 
</P>
<P>
As long as no one's the wiser, social butterflies can also rent an outfit that 
they would never buy for a single night of revelry. 
</P>
<P>
Rental Boutique in Santa Ana stocks floor-length gowns, tea-length taffeta 
dresses, sequined jackets and Lurex sweaters. A dress that would sell for $500 
in a department store can be rented for about $60 here. 
</P>
<P>
Kathi Schanz of Laguna Niguel rented a long-sleeved black sequined dress for a 
recent Christmas party. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd bought it new, it would have cost at least $450," Schanz says. "I paid 
$60, and I was the best-dressed person at the party." 
</P>
<P>
Among the boutique's better quality rentals: a long strapless black gown by 
Lillie Rubin with a ruched bodice and big bow at the back, for $100, and a 
simple orchid-colored lame skirt and a black velvet top for $65. Both outfits 
would sell for more than $500, according to Judith Gaon, owner of Rental 
Boutique. 
</P>
<P>
Gaon says her customers are more willing to experiment with new styles if they 
don't have to pay to keep them in their wardrobes. 
</P>
<P>
"This one woman's going to a party. She's very conservative, but look what 
she's wearing," said Gaon, showing off a strapless gown of cobalt blue lame, 
blue satin gloves and a matching evening hat trimmed with net. 
</P>
<P>
"The customers can rent something that's not them because they don't have to 
own it. They're wearing a costume, even though it's evening wear."

Taffeta, satin and sequins for the girls; pegged pants and fancy cummerbunds 
for the guys. 
</P>
<P>
These were the fashions most prominent at Brea-Olinda High School's winter 
formal dance Dec. 9 at Plaza de Cafes in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the dresses were strapless or spaghetti-strapped, and almost all were 
cut above the knee. Some girls went for metallic golds, silvers, blues or 
greens. Popular colors tended to be the darker ones -- black, royal blue and 
jade -- though some opted for pastels. "I like the pink dresses," said Archana 
Hardas, a Brea-Olinda junior. 
</P>
<P>
Velvet was still the most desired fabric, though only a few actually wore 
dresses made of it. "Velvet dresses with ruffles, either sleeveless or with big 
sleeves, are nice," junior Chrissy Barlet said. "But there is a limit to the 
ruffles, as nobody likes too many frills and bows." 
</P>
<P>
Senior Wendy Winslow said the fashion key was to keep it simple. "Tight, short 
dresses are in, but they have to be simple," she said. "Wear a lot of 
accessories." 
</P>
<P>
For guys, it was much easier: Black tuxedos and patent leather shoes. Of 
course, bow ties and cummerbunds had to match the girl's dress. 
</P>
<P>
"Most wore short, fitted jackets rather than long ones," junior Ray Jordan 
said. "Though some did show up in tails." JOOYOUNG LEE

WINTER WINDOWS HELP MAKE THE HOLIDAYS A SPECIAL SEASON, AND NOT JUST FOR 
SHOPPERS

Even on a balmy December night, passers-by who peer into the arched window of 
The White Rabbit gift shop in San Clemente can feel a shiver. 
</P>
<P>
There, amid snowdrifts and sparkling white woodland animals, stands a 
glistening snow queen in a filmy white gown dripping with pearly beads. Behind 
her, a silk screen forest of white trees twinkles with mini-lights. 
</P>
<P>
"The window has an ethereal feeling," says Jamie Lewis, owner of The White 
Rabbit. Two years ago, Lewis entered her snow queen window in a contest of 
commercial and residential holiday displays sponsored by the San Clemente 
Chamber of Commerce and took the sweepstakes award. 
</P>
<P>
"People stop by just to tell me what a wonderful window it is. It's enchanting 
for children. They believe the animals are real." 
</P>
<P>
'Tis the season for those artistic spirits who decorate store windows to really 
shine. 
</P>
<P>
Like real-life Jack Frosts, they can create a sparkling winter wonderland even 
as the warm Santa Ana winds whip through sunny Southern California. They know 
shoppers expect and want imitation icicles, snow, frosted windows and all the 
other trappings of a Norman Rockwell Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
While setting up a winter window for The Forgotten Woman at Fashion Island's 
Atrium Court in Newport Beach, free-lance display artist Suzanne Weber began 
looking like one of her glitter-covered mannequins. 
</P>
<P>
"People think this is fun," says Weber, shaking the silver specks out of her 
brown hair as she toyed with a mannequin's lavish headdress. "It's fun, but 
it's also back-breaking work, and you get filthy." 
</P>
<P>
Through her business, Suzu Designs, Weber creates windows for shops throughout 
Orange County, including Fogal Merletto and Kiere at Newport Center Fashion 
Island and A Pea in the Pod at South Coast Plaza's Crystal Court in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest part is coming up with new ideas for all of the stores," she says. 
"I try to do things original and different that tease the eye." 
</P>
<P>
At The Forgotten Woman, she made elaborate headdresses of iridescent ornaments, 
beads and glitter for mannequins to wear with black and silver gowns. For 
props, she wrapped long strands of faux pearl garland around the trunks of 
white Christmas trees and planted them in silver pots. 
</P>
<P>
"It's holiday without red and green," she says. 
</P>
<P>
At A Pea in the Pod, a maternity fashion store, she surrounded mannequins 
wearing black gowns with brown paper packages tied with straw and topped with 
pine cones and gold balls. A garland of gold twigs hung from the back wall, and 
papier-mache deer with antlers and faces sprayed with gold glitter rested on a 
bed of pine cones. 
</P>
<P>
"I work with materials not normally considered artistic," Weber says. 
</P>
<P>
She hunts everywhere for props, including florist supply and art stores, used 
furniture and thrift shops. At a hardware store, she bought yards of window 
screen, which she scrunched and molded into a large, abstract sculpture. When 
illuminated with white lights, it served as a backdrop for mannequins. 
</P>
<P>
"I experiment with different things," she says. "Instead of an evergreen tree, 
I might use a glittered gold cone." 
</P>
<P>
For a summer window, she piled plastic fruit on the mannequin's heads so they 
looked like a trio of Carmen Mirandas. 
</P>
<P>
Necessity gives rise to innovative decorating trends. Display artists often 
work with a limited budget, so they have to improvise. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, for example, created her snow queen from an old mannequin donated by a 
local merchant. She painted the dummy's face white and fashioned hair out of 
twisted newspaper. She made the gown from inexpensive fabric and beaded garland 
normally used on Christmas trees. She bent and twisted ornaments to make a 
tiara for the snow queen's head. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis did such an impressive job of transforming the dummy that "a lot of 
people think of her as an angel." 
</P>
<P>
The entire display cost under $500, and Lewis deliberately avoids using any of 
her own merchandise to set the scene. She sees the window as her gift to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas needs to maintain that magic, special feeling," she says. "Not 
everything has to be commercial. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole window is just a fantasy scene for people to enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time, however, a display artist's first goal is to sell 
merchandise. With so many advertising messages competing for shoppers' 
attention, they need special techniques to attract and hold the eye. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to make a real statement, because the customer only has a few seconds 
to register what you're selling," says Shirley Meusch, owner of Havoc, a new 
and used clothing shop in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Before opening her shop six years ago, Meusch worked as a display manager for 
Nordstrom in the Brea Mall for nine years and at Broadway for five years. 
</P>
<P>
"The window can't be a little of everything," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Display artists must be careful not to distract the eye with too much clutter. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's good to use the same style of shoe on all the mannequins, or 
have them all wear gold jewelry. If you put a real interesting belt on one, the 
next mannequin might need a necklace and no belt." 
</P>
<P>
Her window at Havoc has been artfully arranged in symmetrical fashion. The 
display forms a one-sided pyramid, from a mannequin in a tapestry skirt and 
burgundy blazer down to a pair of round sunglasses at the pyramid's point. A 
tapestry blazer on a T-shaped hanger, a pair of pants, a sweater and shoes all 
rest in horizontal or vertical positions. To put clothes at an angle confuses 
the eye, Meusch says. 
</P>
<P>
"The eye looks from left to right or up and down." 
</P>
<P>
Lighting can also pull the eye toward an important piece of merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, a well-done window will draw people into the shop. Yet display artists 
know that no matter how great their creation, it won't linger long. 
</P>
<P>
"Display is a temporary art," Meusch says. "It's torn down and can never be 
used again."

BLACK STILL BASIC IN HOSIERY, BUT GLITZ IS IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Gold is in, glitz is it, but black is the perennial bestseller in holiday leg 
wear, say hosiery department sales staffs. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers looking for hosiery to wear with this season's opulent evening clothes 
will find plenty of options -- iridescent, jewel tone, elegant or whimsical 
patterns -- at prices ranging from $5 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
What isn't an option is basic beige. Women accustomed to stopping by a 
mini-market, grabbing a package of beige panty hose and wriggling into them in 
the car on the way to a party will find themselves out of step with this year's 
fashions. 
</P>
<P>
Even the favorite sheer black stockings have gone beyond basic. They are 
seamed, jeweled, clocked, flocked and bow-tied. They sparkle with jet beads, 
gold foil, discreet -- or indiscreet -- rhinestone accents. 
</P>
<P>
"Embellishment" is essential, according to Antoinette Corley, who is promotions 
manager/fashion production for the Broadway department stores. Beaded gowns 
with a 1920s flavor look best with seamed or clocked stocking styles, she 
noted. Back seams and satin bows at the ankle suit the tuxedo look for women. 
And colored hose complete the all-in-one effect with gowns of red, green or 
royal blue. 
</P>
<P>
With black-and-gold party dresses, a gold foil detail on one leg of sheer black 
hose helps pull the look together. Black embroidery and jet beads on black 
stockings provide the finishing touch for a black velvet and red satin gown. 
</P>
<P>
Sequined or jewel-encrusted gowns also require something special -- an 
iridescent gleam, at the very least -- in coordinated stockings. And with this 
year's very big little black dress, "the detail often is in the hose, not the 
gown," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Stockings are no longer an afterthought, Corley said, but an important 
accessory. They are considered in the purchase of a dress and in wardrobe 
planning by women who patronize the Broadway store at South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
"The customers know what they want. They buy basic black, for example, and 
accessorize with stockings and earrings. They want to wear (a dress) for more 
than one party, rhinestones at the ankle for evening and sheer black to 
church," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At Frederick's of Hollywood in Westminster Mall, customers bring in evening 
clothes, even wedding dresses, to match hosiery, said store manager Susan 
Whetstone-Laws. 
</P>
<P>
"I have girls drag in 20-pound dresses to make sure they get the right 
stockings," she said. 
</P>
<P>
While they're not always sure of their taste -- "They bring in dresses and ask 
us to select stockings," Whetstone-Laws said -- her customers are buying gold 
in a big way this year. 
</P>
<P>
The store's newest style is black stretch-knit panty hose embossed with a gold 
ivy-and-rose pattern. "They look great with gold lame," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For evening, party-goers like gold and silver foil stockings with an embossed 
pattern of champagne glasses. "I wore these stockings in silver with a simple 
black velvet dress with a silver brooch at the center of the sweetheart 
neckline," Whetstone-Laws said. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday stockings can be whimsical too. 
</P>
<P>
Just for fun, women are buying white panty hose dotted with candy canes and 
holly berries or accented with peppermint-stripe seams, red bows and jingle 
bells at the ankles. There is also a pair of black stockings decorated on one 
ankle with a red Santa sporting a tiny pearl at the tip of his hat. 
</P>
<P>
Male customers, who make up 40% of Frederick's hosiery customers, buy red or 
green fishnet stockings for the holidays. "For some reason, men like fishnet," 
Whetstone-Laws said. 
</P>
<P>
Men also like "fancy things" in hosiery, she said, and often purchase stockings 
to complete an outfit. "They'll buy a leather dress or skirt at another store 
in the mall and want stockings to go with it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom's hosiery department also gets men customers, said Brenda Danielson, 
hosiery buyer for the South Coast Plaza store. But they often feel out of place 
in this women's department. 
</P>
<P>
"Men are more comfortable buying sox," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hosiery is a hard thing to buy," Danielson said. Women make an effort to match 
or coordinate their dresses and stockings for the one-color look that's 
current, she pointed out. (It's also possible to achieve that all-in-one look 
for your mink coat, with mink pompons at the heels of your stockings.) 
</P>
<P>
Many women prefer rhinestone-accented or sparkle hose for evening, Danielson 
said, but younger, "more funky" customers like Capri tights -- footless opaque 
stockings with lace or rhinestones at the bottom edge. In black, white, ivory 
or earth tones, they are paired with chiffon skirts for evening. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County stocking sellers agreed, however, that the best-selling hosiery 
for holiday wear and all year long is, hands down, black ultra-sheer.

MEN, TOO, ARE GOING FOR AN OLD SMOOTHIE

<P>
Even before Little Lord Fauntleroy flounced through 19th-Century storybooks in 
a black velvet suit with lace collar -- a get-up which quickly became a symbol 
of the quintessential sissy -- many men have shared a certain sentiment about 
velvet, the lush, plush stuff that's the current word in women's holiday dress. 
</P>
<P>
"Ugh," groans John Abajian, 41, a Costa Mesa jeweler, for example. "Never in my 
entire life would I wear velvet. And my wife wouldn't let me either. People 
would think I have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Elena Martinez, 25, a Brea telephone operator, clarifies the "problem." 
</P>
<P>
"Velvet's beautiful, but too feminine," she says, adding that neither she nor 
any of her friends would "ever in a million years" go out with a man clothed in 
the sensuous fabric of ultimate luxe. "It's not for a man man image, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
Nobles of generations past -- and fashion arbiters today -- may beg to differ. 
</P>
<P>
With sexy vests, crested slippers, host coats, bow ties and suspenders that go 
partying at night, this season stylish men all over are going soft on velvet. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from Scarlett O'Hara's dress of drapes, and South of the Border Day-Glo 
paintings, the velvet creations in which these samples of suave can relax or 
entertain are some of the smoothest, most elegant ever. 
</P>
<P>
But then, velvet has always meant savoir-faire. 
</P>
<P>
Romeo wooed Juliet in tights and a velvet jerkin. Henry VIII ruled while 
gussying his girth in a gold-embroidered gown with fur collar and lining -- a 
gown of the most sumptuous velvet available. That old French roue, Louis XIV, 
wasn't appropriately clothed unless his ensemble -- lace cravat, fur muff and 
beribboned cane -- included velvet coat and breeches tied at the knee. 
</P>
<P>
And then no self-respecting 19th-Century English gentleman, said by a fashion 
observer of the day to be "the noted elegant of the world, imperturbable, 
ironic, a graceful model for aristocratic bearing and behavior," would feel up 
to snuff without a velvet-collared Chesterfield coat. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most macho of men, the Spanish bullfighter, historically wouldn't 
dream of ceremoniously entering the ring naked of his capa de paseo, or velvet 
bullfighter's cloak. 
</P>
<P>
Men of power, pride and, not incidentally, pampering knew what velvet was 
about: luxury. 
</P>
<P>
And whether it's Ralph Lauren's double-breasted host coat and Church's 
hard-soled slippers -- for the most conservative and elegant of men -- or 
Kathrine Hemnett's skintight vest and stretch leggings -- for hipsters of a 
trendy bent -- today's velvet clothes and accessories continue the tradition of 
styling party-goers and stay-at-homers in unabashed extravagance. 
</P>
<P>
"Velvet on men, especially during the holidays, is always so elegant, so 
sophisticated," says Carol Horowitz, vice president and general manager of 
Neiman Marcus at Newport Center Fashion Island. "There is nothing more fabulous 
than a man in a velvet smoking jacket." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are men unimpressed by velvet's pedigree. 
</P>
<P>
"I wear cowboy boots and Wranglers every day and if I wore a velvet anything I 
wouldn't feel right," says Manual Garcia, 42, a Santa Ana messenger. About the 
only man I know who could pull it off is the guy in (Gainsborough's) painting, 
"The Blue Boy." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Woods, 33, a Laguna Beach psychiatric nurse, wouldn't feel himself in the 
traditionally formal fabric either. "Unless it was a Halloween costume," he 
jokes, finding velvet fairly gross and "old." "It reminds me of something 
tacky, from the '50s, and if I wore it my friends would call me an old man." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, the material's bad rap may result from associations with lizard-friendly 
lounge booths, unctuous crushed tuxedos and singer Mel Torme, dubbed "The 
Velvet Fog." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as it strikes Huntington Beach veterinary assistant Lori Struck, 18: 
"Velvet, you think of drapes -- old, old drapes." Asked if there would be 
nothing more fabulous than her boyfriend in a velvet smoking jacket, Jeremy 
Runyan, 19, of Orange, is fairly repelled. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way! He'd die. Velvet's so disco," she says. "When you think of it you 
think greasy John Travolta in 'Saturday Night Fever' or (one-time teeny-bopper 
heartthrob) Shaun Cassidy in a jacket that kind of, like, shines. Yuck!" 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are those of rather different opinions, shoppers snapping up 
the velvet jackets, slippers, vests, suspenders, bow ties and other items that 
fill stores during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these are special items that sell out very fast," Horowitz says. After 
all, during these festive days when dressy occasions reign, "velvet has always 
been a classic, for men as well as women," says Wilmer Weiss, a senior vice 
president and fashion insider at I. Magnin/Bullocks Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
Velvet is special, indeed. And whether a man steps out suave in a sumptuous 
smoking jacket, shows up smooth in regally crested shoes or shimmies into hip, 
sexy leggings, he will be following a tradition established early in the 
evolutionary chain of chic: when nobles, kings and cavaliers -- veritable 
peacocks of power and persuasion -- draped their frames in the most extravagant 
fabrics of the day. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys should really enjoy wearing velvet around the holidays because it's 
simply a lot of fun," says John Slater, in his mid-40s and manager of the 
Polo-Ralph Lauren Shop at South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, he adds, "It takes a guy very self-confident to wear it. The type 
who knows he looks good in clothes, knows he's a fashion statement, perhaps. A 
leader." 
</P>
<P>
But, hey, Rodney Rivers, 27, a Newport Beach milliner, will be progressive this 
holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah! I'll wear velvet," he says. "You don't see it too much, but when you 
do, you say, 'Yes sir, there's man of the world who knows how to dress. Who 
understands fine quality.' Velvet's not that common, but then, good taste isn't 
that common either." 
</P>
<P>
 And anyway, notes Bernadette Arellano, 20, a Laguna Beach sales assistant at 
the Nature Company store in Costa Mesa -- and a woman of obvious taste, "Velvet 
on a guy looks so cool!"

TAKE A TOY, ANY TOY: FIELD IS WIDE OPEN

<P>
So here you sit. The Shopping-Days-Left-Till-Christmas countdown has reached 
single digits, and your list is still littered with blanks and question marks. 
</P>
<P>
And that's just the adults. You haven't even thought about all those kids yet, 
and you hate elbowing your way through those crowded toy store aisles. 
</P>
<P>
So here's the good news: Relax. No need to panic. 
</P>
<P>
It's not one of those years where there's one must-have toy. No Teddy Ruxpin. 
No ET. No Transformers. No Rubik's Cube. No Cabbage Patch Doll. No pressure to 
either deliver that one hot item or face that unbearable look of crushed 
adolescent hope. 
</P>
<P>
Or is that the bad news? Without your selection predetermined, you are free to 
use your imagination. Or even -- God forbid -- your own childhood memories. You 
can go toy shopping this year with the knowledge that it's a wide-open 
playground out there. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no steamroller," said Jim Woodward, manager of the FAO Schwarz store 
in South Coast Plaza. "The Nintendo units, which dominated last year, are still 
hot, but there's no one 'must-have' thing. Instead, people are shifting their 
attention to things that get overlooked in steamroller years." 
</P>
<P>
"Parents generally Christmas shop with a particular figure in mind of what they 
want to spend," explained Mark Haag, general manager of the Toys R Us chain, 
which has four stores in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's one hot item, and that item costs X, and X is 80% of that person's 
budget figure, then there's not much left over to spread around on other toys. 
But if no one thing demands to be bought, then the money gets spread over 
several items, and that's what we've been seeing so far this season." 
</P>
<P>
But no steamroller does not mean no monster toys. These are, after all, kids 
we're dealing with, and kids are nothing if not malleable. You want help? Here 
are some of the season's hottest toys: 
</P>
<P>
Video Games: For the third straight year, Nintendo home units are the champ, 
but this year they are joined by a new Nintendo hand-held unit called Game Boy. 
</P>
<P>
Prime software for both the home and hand-held units includes Tetris, a 
block-building game of Russian origin, Super Mario Brothers II and Teen-Age 
Mutant Ninja Turtles (yes, them again). Caveat: Nintendo is notorious for 
limiting supply to juice the demand. Don't wait till Christmas Eve to pick up a 
Game Boy. 
</P>
<P>
Two other full-scale systems have taken home video games to a new level with 
their 16-bit processing: Turbo-Grafix-16 from NEC and Genesis from Sega. Both 
are off to strong starts in area stores. 
</P>
<P>
Dolls: The hot newcomers: Oopsie Daisy, who crawls, falls down, cries and picks 
herself back up (battery-powered); Li'l Miss Dress Up, whose dress changes 
colors (special pen-operated); and Pretty Penni Chatterbox, who talks as you 
stroke her hair (patience-operated). 
</P>
<P>
The perennials: Barbie, particularly the Happy Holidays version, part of her 
30th anniversary (how does she stay so young?) edition; Betsy Wetsy ("People 
seem to want dolls that wet their diapers again," offered Paul Daverio, manager 
of the Play Co Toys branch in Anaheim); and Tiny Tears, the original crying 
doll. 
</P>
<P>
Superfast Cars: These battery-powered racers are about six inches long and can 
get up to almost 20 m.p.h. They're the steamroller item in Japan, where they 
originated, but have not made the impact in Orange County that was predicted at 
the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"The cars are doing very well, the tracks for them only so-so," notes Play Co's 
Daverio. "I try to explain to people that the enjoyment is limited without the 
track. I mean, where's the fun is running it for a few seconds until it hits 
the wall, then chasing it down? But so far, I haven't had much luck getting the 
point across." 
</P>
<P>
Batman paraphernalia: Yes, kids still want it, but it's not as omnipresent as 
it was last summer, when every 10-year-old was required by his peers to sport 
some Batman symbol somewhere on his person at all times. 
</P>
<P>
"The video (release) has kept demand up. BatCars, for instance, are still doing 
well," Toys R Us' Haag says. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, there is a shortage of some Batman-related items because, of all 
reasons, much of it comes from mainland China, and some factories were shut 
down last summer during and immediately after the student/worker revolt. 
</P>
<P>
Still worried? Here's the best news: You can rely on your own experience. 
Remember what you liked when you were a child? Buy it. As Cole Porter promised, 
"Everything old is new again." 
</P>
<P>
Pop sociologists explain it this way: Baby boomers are having their own 
children. No generation is as self-absorbed as this one. What was good enough 
for their childhood is obviously better for their own kids. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts see it this way: Parents fear buying the wrong toy, so they 
buy whatever's safe. Normally, that translates into what's hot. With nothing 
super hot, safe translates into familiar. 
</P>
<P>
So what else is selling this Christmas? Try board games: Monopoly, Chutes and 
Ladders, Candyland. Try wooden toys: trains, rocking horses, human figures. 
Paper dolls that you cut out. Jump ropes. Piggy banks. GI Joes. Dollhouses. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of the blue, a lot of the classic toys have stepped up their advertising 
campaigns," said Woodward of FAO Schwarz. "Maybe they sense the nostalgia of 
the baby boom parents. I don't know. All I do know is that the basics, the 
classic toys, are taking a larger share of the holiday market than in any other 
season in recent memory." 
</P>
<P>
Lest you think, however, that the '80s will go down without a fight, we leave 
you with this piece of information: At B.N. Genius, an upscale, adult toy chain 
whose store in Crystal Court is three months old, the hottest item is the Coin 
Puter. A savings bank, it is described as a "savings toy for all ages" and 
features a digital display of both the amount being deposited and the amount 
accrued inside. 
</P>
<P>
Perfect for that acquisitive child of your favorite yuppie cousins. Unless, of 
course, you would rather get him a box of crayons.

MAGIC MISSING IN LIVELY 'NUTCRACKER' 
</P>

<P>
The curtain rises on the Christmas Eve party in the Joffrey Ballet "Nutcracker" 
and the stage quickly fills with action. Soon, you see something going on in 
virtually every nook and cranny you can find. 
</P>
<P>
The intent may be to feast the eye, but as seen Wednesday, at the beginning of 
a five-day run at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, the production 
looked more obsessed with incidents and objects than with touching the heart. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps this is not the way Robert Joffrey would have left it: Joffrey had 
initiated the concept of an American "Nutcracker" set in the 1850s and lived to 
see its premiere in 1987, but failing health forced him to rely upon others for 
its final execution. George Verdak and Scott Barnard receive credit for the 
staging. Gerald Arpino, now the company's artistic director, choreographed the 
waltzes of the Snowflakes and the Flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Nostalgic appeal is provided by Oliver Smith's pop-up Christmas card scenery 
and the Currier and Ives-inspired costumes by John David Ridge. Television 
puppeteer Kermit Love created imaginative designs for the mice and a 
not-so-cute giant Mother Ginger figure. 
</P>
<P>
One can admire a certain logic at work. The toys given to the children in Act I 
prefigure the dancers in the Act II divertissements. Clara (the dewy Mary 
Barton) populates her dream with figures from her life. Her mother (Deborah 
Dawn) and father (Douglas Martin) recur as elegant Snow King and Queen; her 
brother Fritz (Edward Stierle) as the tirelessly bounding Snow Prince. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Fritz's growing anger at the attention paid Clara provides realistic 
motivation for grabbing the Nutcracker Doll and hurling it across the floor. 
</P>
<P>
But the pacing is relentlessly allegro con brio. The Mouse Battle proves 
equally busy -- and blurred in design. Clara's climatic contribution comes out 
of nowhere, and easily can be missed. Arpino's choreography for the snow scene 
continues the frantic pace. 
</P>
<P>
Act II merely gets fussy. Drosselmeyer (the authoritative Alexander Grant) does 
not disappear as usual but remains to stage-manage everything. It's bad enough 
that he brings on each dancer with a distinctive flourish, but to cull music 
from Act I to support his gestures is intrusive, insensitive. 
</P>
<P>
On opening night, the company looked eager and willing, as usual, but somehow 
nothing magical happened. Tina LeBlanc was a pert, lively Sugar Plum Fairy. Tom 
Mossbrucker proved a merely likable, fresh-faced Nephew and a bland Nutcracker 
Prince. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Corry executed the thankless, militaristic duties of the Nutcracker Doll 
with precision and verve but didn't get much of a chance to dance until he 
joined the Russian quartet in Act II. 
</P>
<P>
Beatriz Rodriguez was lithe and vivid as both the Spanish dancer and Columbine 
(filling in for an ill Meg Gurin). Valerie Madonia and Douglas Martin deftly 
executed the kitschy Arabian dance. Cynthia Giannini and Stierle were the 
springy Chinese duo. 
</P>
<P>
But Allan Lewis subjected Tchaikovsky's wonderful score to speedy, pedestrian, 
anti-lyrical conducting, and the Pacific Symphony responded with unpolished 
sounds. The off-key Crystal Cathedral Boychoir was piped in for the Snow Scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The Joffrey Ballet dances "The Nutcracker" through Sunday at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $11 to $42.

GANG STORY PINS HOPE ON THE FAMILY; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: JAIME GOMEZ'S 'SMILE NOW, CRY LATER,' A THREE-ACT MUSICAL DRAMA, 
PREMIERES TONIGHT AT FULLERTON COLLEGE.

<P>
The gang problem has baffled social scientists and police for years as they've 
wondered whether there's a solution. And, like others, playwright Jaime Gomez 
of Fullerton is more apt to shrug in frustration than to offer concrete 
answers. But Gomez, who since 1985 has run a shelter for the homeless while 
writing and acting for Latino theater groups, believes that there is a starting 
point for hope -- the family. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be a little obvious, but the family is crucial. It's where it all 
begins," said Gomez, 35. "Families need to become more together and be there 
for the kids. There has to be a foundation that they can return to when faced 
with gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't have a home to learn the right things in, they look elsewhere. 
Too often, a gang can become a family for kids who are searching or are facing 
things, like poverty and peer pressure." 
</P>
<P>
With this as the focus, Gomez wrote "Smile Now, Cry Later" for Teatro Cometa, 
an Orange County drama troupe that deals primarily with minority issues, 
especially those affecting the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
The three-act musical drama premieres tonight at Fullerton College's Wilshire 
Theatre and continues Saturday, after which Gomez plans to take it on tour to 
local schools and other venues throughout the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez describes "Smile Now, Cry Later" as a slice-of-life piece, not based on 
any specific incidents he has encountered but representing a pastiche of 
inner-city problems. He said, however, that his experiences operating the New 
Vista Shelter for Homeless Families in Fullerton gave him insight into the 
troubles youngsters have when a stable home life is missing. 
</P>
<P>
The play's plotting is straightforward: Two families are represented, with 
young Latinos from both becoming attracted to local gangs. After they join, 
there's a street killing. The victim's gang pledges revenge, and the tragedy 
escalates. The setting could be East Los Angeles, or it could be Santa Ana. 
Gomez said he didn't want to be specific because the dilemma is so widespread. 
</P>
<P>
"These types of things are happening everywhere, even in Orange County," he 
said. "Anybody who doesn't think that is fooling themselves." 
</P>
<P>
The families' reactions form the core of the play, and Gomez hopes that it will 
inspire people to reflect on how they respond to their own children and what 
they would do if faced with a similar situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it makes a few good points (about) how poverty and peer pressure and 
the glorification of gangs make them look good to young people," he said. "But 
I really want the audience to to see it and re-evaluate their relationship with 
their kids and their families in general. They should also look at themselves 
and question what it is that their family needs to stay together." 
</P>
<P>
Gomez said two things worried him while writing "Smile Now, Cry Later." He 
wanted to avoid sensationalizing gang activity and to instruct without being 
preachy. "What's so hard is giving your point of view while not giving 
everybody a lecture." 
</P>
<P>
Along with trying to avoid the soapbox, Gomez said, he has attempted to make 
the piece as entertaining as possible within its serious framework. The play 
includes a few dance numbers performed by the 23-member cast and a handful of 
"street-style" songs indigenous to the culture. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to give a feel for the streets, (and) all the original music is 
funky, the driving force of the streets," he said. "We also have some ballads 
and plenty of choreography that has a street flavor." 
</P>
<P>
As with most Teatro Cometa productions (over the years, they've dealt with 
migrant workers, amnesty rights and the importance of the census for 
minorities, among other topics), "Smile Now, Cry Later" is a collaborative 
effort utilizing people from the community. Youngsters from local junior high 
and high schools are part of the cast, and Gomez has brought in a team of 
Latino artists to help with the staging and choreography. Among them is Emigdio 
Chavez Vasquez, a noted local muralist who designed the play's set. 
</P>
<P>
It's likely that work will continue on the play in the coming months, said 
Gomez, noting that he would like to trim the length of the piece somewhat and 
eventually cut the cast to nine people. "We really want to reach more 
communities by going on the road, and 24 actors is just too much," he said. 
"We'll get it nice and lean, and then we'll be ready." 
</P>
<P>
 "Smile Now, Cry Later" will be performed today and Saturday at 8 p.m. at 
Fullerton College's Wilshire Theatre, 321 E. Chapman Ave., Fullerton. Tickets: 
$5. Information: (714) 871-8101.

T.S.O.L. ENDS DISPUTE OVER REUNION SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
ROCK: WITH THE INTERNAL WRANGLING OVER, MEMBERS OF THE CURRENT LINEUP WANT TO 
LOOK AHEAD AND JUST CONCENTRATE ON MUSIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The members of T.S.O.L. present have decided that they can accept a one-night 
resurrection of the ghost of T.S.O.L. past without being spooked into a 
premature breakup. 
</P>
<P>
After weeks of internal wrangling, current T.S.O.L. members Joe Wood and Mitch 
Dean have withdrawn their opposition to band mate Mike Roche's participation in 
a Dec. 29 reunion show by the band's original lineup. Bassist Roche is the only 
current member left from the original lineup of T.S.O.L. (True Sounds Of 
Liberty), which was a leading attraction on the Southern California punk rock 
scene of the early '80s. The current version of T.S.O.L., which evolved after 
the original Huntington Beach-Long Beach band split apart in 1983, plays a far 
different brand of rock influenced by blues and heavy metal. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as Tuesday, it appeared that Roche had bowed out of the reunion 
because of pressure from Wood and Dean. The three other original members, Jack 
Grisham, Ron Emory and Todd Barnes, were planning to play the show with another 
bassist filling in for Roche. 
</P>
<P>
But promoter Gary Tovar, whose Goldenvoice Presents is putting on the T.S.O.L. 
reunion at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim, began to bring some persuasive 
pressure of his own to bear so that Roche would be able to play the concert. By 
Wednesday, Wood and Dean had relented, allowing Roche to go ahead with the 
reunion without jeopardizing his spot in the current T.S.O.L. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to get away from all the petty things and just get back to music," 
Roche said Thursday. "We're going to play a really good (reunion) show, and the 
night after I'll start doing some shows again with the new T.S.O.L. I had an 
excellent talk with Mitch yesterday, and it looks like (the current T.S.O.L. 
is) well on the road to recovery." 
</P>
<P>
The current band's internal problems erupted in mid-October after only a few 
dates of a national tour. Angered by the tour's collapse and finding himself in 
a financial bind, Roche approached Goldenvoice about staging a reunion show -- 
something he had refused to do in the past, despite lucrative offers. 
</P>
<P>
With an already-recorded album, "Strange Love," due for release in February on 
Enigma Records, the current T.S.O.L. members tried to patch up their 
differences and get the band back on course. But Roche's involvement in the 
reunion show was a stumbling block. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Roche said, he gave in and agreed not to play the reunion. "I've got 
too much invested in my band, and I've been working too hard and too long to 
let anything get in the way," he said. "I decided that I couldn't afford to 
take the chance of destroying my future for one show." 
</P>
<P>
Tovar, whose company is one of Southern California's leading alternative rock 
promoters, said he intervened to save the reunion show after it was 
"insinuated" that the current T.S.O.L. might take legal steps to "stop the 
whole show," even after Roche had dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike had done a 360-degree turn on us. He was really intimidated into not 
playing," Tovar said. "I tried to appeal (to Wood and Dean) that this was a 
one-show situation and not career threatening to the new T.S.O.L. I also 
appealed to them that it would look bad for the new T.S.O.L. if they spoiled 
this one-time opportunity for the fans who wanted to see (the original band's 
reunion). I said, 'Be done with this and move on.' I think it finally set in 
with them that they would have looked like villains if they tried to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Zoto, manager of the current T.S.O.L., said the band didn't want to risk 
the falling out with Tovar that likely would have resulted if the reunion 
concert had been derailed or its draw weakened because of Roche's absence. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said Wednesday that Roche's willingness to give up the reunion show was an 
important concession that helped the current T.S.O.L. move toward a 
reconciliation. "That showed me where his heart was. It showed me good faith in 
the band." 
</P>
<P>
After that, Wood said, he and Dean, who joined T.S.O.L. in 1984, were less 
concerned about Roche going ahead with the reunion performance. Wood said he 
dislikes the prospect of the show raising comparisons between the old and new 
T.S.O.L., and he would rather the public focused on the band's future instead 
of its past. But the real trouble, he said, was that Roche had set up the 
reunion at a troubled time for the band and that he did it without consulting 
the other current members. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad that it's all behind us and we can move on," Wood said. "I hope it's 
a good show. I think everybody's happy. The show's going to go on, and T.S.O.L. 
is going to continue."

DEPUTIES APPEAL FIRING, DENY JAIL CROSS-BURNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Two fired sheriff's deputies denied Thursday that they burned a cross in Los 
Angeles County Men's Central Jail, where members of the Crips, a black street 
gang, were housed about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The two, Brian E. Kazmierski and Richard D. Bolks, testified at a Civil Service 
Commission appeals hearing that they were merely playing around when Bolks 
stuck two pieces of tape to a control booth window to "X-out" a swastika sign 
flashed by an inmate called "Red." 
</P>
<P>
Both former jailers admitted lighting spray from an aerosol can and using the 
flames to kill cockroaches in the control booth. They also said they pointed 
the "flame throwers" at an inmate who was spraying water at them from beyond 
the control room glass. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing racially motivated," Bolks insisted. "These two pieces of 
tape were hung in a window by myself, and I immediately pulled the tape off the 
window. . . . My intention was simply to denounce his (Red's) act." 
</P>
<P>
Both Bolks and Kazmierski denied the tape was ever set on fire. 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy probe by sheriff's investigators, the two former jailers were 
accused in letters of discharge of burning a cross in Module 4800 on the 
evening shift sometime between Dec. 26, 1987, and Jan. 11, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"The module lights were dimmed and heavy-metal music, which is considered as 
'devil worship' or 'satanic' music by the Crips, was played and racial remarks 
. . . were also made over the loudspeaker system," the letters said. 
</P>
<P>
"The incident incited the inmates to such a degree that some inmates talked of 
taking a deputy hostage in retaliation for the racial tones of the incident." 
</P>
<P>
Bolks and Kazmierski were accused of first admitting to supervisors that a 
cross was burned and then denying it to investigators. They were advised that 
by their action they had forfeited their rights to be sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Hearing officer Huey P. Shepard took the case under submission Thursday after 
attorney Richard Shinee, representing Bolks and Kazmierski, and Sgt. Susan 
Weekly, Sheriff's Department advocate, decided to skip oral or written 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
In an opening statement, however, Shinee said a cross was never burned in the 
Crips module and that "horseplay" by his clients had been exaggerated by 
inmates "to get the deputies in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Reports that crosses had been burned in Men's Central Jail surfaced in January 
at a Civil Service Commission hearing for Eugene A. Harris, a probationary 
black deputy who had been fired for allegedly stealing one inmate's candy bar 
and taking another's hair brush. 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, George Ricks, a black deputy with 18 years service, 
testified under questioning by Harris' lawyer, Laurence B. Labovitz, that 
crosses had been burned at the jail. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department launched an investigation soon afterward.

AMBASSADOR COLLEGE TO MOVE BUT AUDITORIUM TO REMAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Ambassador College, a small Pasadena school run by the sectarian Worldwide 
Church of God and best known for its Ambassador Auditorium, announced Thursday 
it will shut down after the spring semester and consolidate its student body at 
its Texas campus. 
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of the church, which has more than 94,000 members worldwide 
and a $200-million annual budget, as well as the Ambassador Auditorium and its 
cultural programs will remain on the 40-acre complex located along the 
Tournament of Roses Parade route, said Michael Snyder, a church spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
But city-imposed limits on growth and the costs of seeking full accreditation 
for both campuses prompted the move, Snyder said. Currently, 637 students are 
enrolled in Pasadena and 500 at the Big Sandy, Tex., campus, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Worldwide Church of God is distinctive for observing many Jewish 
traditions, including a Saturday Sabbath, and rejecting Christmas and other 
Christian holidays as pagan in origin. The college was started in 1947 by radio 
evangelist Herbert W. Armstrong, who moved his church base from Oregon to 
Pasadena that year. 
</P>
<P>
The college was embroiled in turmoil in May, 1978, when Armstrong and his son, 
Garner Ted Armstrong, the heir apparent, had a falling out amid a church power 
struggle. The Texas campus had closed the year before and the senior Armstrong 
sharply scaled back the Pasadena curriculum to a ministerial training program. 
</P>
<P>
But the 1,600-acre Big Sandy campus was reopened as a junior college in 1981 
and Texas officials granted approval this year for it to begin a four-year 
liberal arts program. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph W. Tkach, successor to the senior Armstrong, who died in 1986, said the 
Pasadena campus will offer extension courses after the consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
"We regret that we will lose even a small part of Ambassador," said Pasadena 
Mayor William Thomson, who added that he recognized the college's limitations 
on expansion.

PERESTROIKA FALLOUT; 
</P>
<P>
NEW WAVE OF JEWISH EMIGRES FINDS SUPPORT SYSTEM ALREADY IN PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Eugene and Sophia Belenky navigated the produce aisle of the supermarket with 
care, walking slowly, letting their eyes rest on each bin of fruit and 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Automatic sprinklers released a light mist that made the green peppers look 
especially crisp, the tomatoes fresh and succulent. 
</P>
<P>
The Belenkys -- among 840 Soviet Jewish refugees who have immigrated to Los 
Angeles in recent months -- marveled at the abundance of goods from which they 
could choose. There were four varieties of lettuce alone. 
</P>
<P>
It made an ordinary trip to the market feel like a luxury -- one small but 
special part of life in this country. 
</P>
<P>
For 15 years, they nurtured a dream to live in America, quietly planning their 
flight to the West. Sophia studied English and Eugene left his job as an 
avionics technician because he was afraid the sensitive nature of his work 
would prevent his departure from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Their dream was finally realized Oct. 27. Shortly after 3 a.m. they and their 
14-year-old daughter, Dina, arrived in Los Angeles and joined their American 
cousins, Adrienne and Joseph Lassman, at a handsome white house on a quiet 
cul-de-sac in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
American Jews have long struggled to bring their Soviet relatives to a place 
where they could live and worship as they pleased. Now that Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of perestroika has opened the doors, Soviet Jews 
are flocking to American cities in unprecedented numbers. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,000 Soviet refugees are expected to arrive in Los Angeles by next 
September, more than double the 1,421 that came last year. They will join an 
estimated 50,000 Soviet Jews who already live here, said Gregory Makaron, 
president of the Assn. of Soviet Jewish Emigres. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike their predecessors who arrived in the 1970s, the new wave of Soviet 
immigrants has family here to provide a support system. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent 10 to 15 years putting our roots in this country," Makaron said. "We 
are ready right now to pay back whatever was done for us." 
</P>
<P>
Jewish Family Service, an agency that helps refugees resettle here, reported 
its busiest month ever in November: 450 people, most of them coming from the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Sima Furman, director of the service's Immigration and Resettlement Office, 
estimates that 70% of the new arrivals settle in West Hollywood, West Los 
Angeles and the Fairfax District, with the remaining 30% sinking roots in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish social service agencies in Los Angeles expect to double the amount of 
money they spend on resettling Jewish refugees -- from less than $2 million 
last year to $5 million during the current fiscal year, said Miriam Prum Hess, 
who coordinates one of the resettlement projects at the Jewish Federation 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, 28,750 Soviet Jews received refuge in this country during the last 
fiscal year, compared to 10,576 during the previous 12 months, according to the 
Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a New York-based migration agency that is 
responsible for bringing nearly all Soviet Jews to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
About half of last year's arrivals, 15,095, went to New York. Chicago was the 
second most popular destination with 2,756, and Los Angeles was third with 
1,421. 
</P>
<P>
Easing the transition to Southern California culture is a network of religious 
congregations, community groups and social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big issue in the Jewish community so everyone is geared up," said 
Esther Krisman, a consultant with the Bureau of Jewish Education. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone welcomes you," said Yelena Pyatigorsky, who arrived here in June. A 
former English teacher, Pyatigorsky now works near her West Hollywood home as a 
Russian translator for Jewish Vocational Services, an agency that helps find 
jobs for the immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"In Russia, there is no Jewish community," Pyatigorsky said. "America is a 
wonderful country. It gives opportunity to all those who want to study, who 
want to work." 
</P>
<P>
But some leaders in the resettlement effort say they have had little time to 
prepare for this new tide of immigrants and are overwhelmed by the number of 
families in need of aid. With private donations and government grants, they are 
struggling to find them employment and help them adapt to a culture 
dramatically different from their own. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish Family Services recently started a volunteer program because counselors 
were unable to keep pace with their rapidly multiplying caseloads. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you have 15 cases all at once," said social worker Roland Champagne. 
"They all want to see you as soon as possible. They all need benefits as soon 
as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society officially sponsors the refugees, it 
contracts with agencies in the community to perform the resettlement work. The 
Jewish Federation, which is the lead agency here, requires that immigrants be 
hosted by a relative or close friend who agrees to provide housing and other 
support until the family gets on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
It costs about $3,000 to resettle each person -- a process that generally lasts 
at least four months. The host family contributes up to $1,600, depending on 
their income, with Jewish agencies making up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
The money covers services ranging from vocational training to counseling for 
depression and culture shock. 
</P>
<P>
Sophia Belenky had an immediate -- and dramatic -- reaction to her new 
surroundings. She had been in Los Angeles only one day when her cousin, 
Adrienne Lassman, took her to an Encino beauty salon. 
</P>
<P>
It was Halloween weekend and stylists dressed for the occasion. There were 
Draculas and ghouls. Heavy makeup and purple fright wigs also abounded. But it 
was the woman dressed as a Viet Cong soldier that proved too much for Belenky. 
Already exhausted from her long trip, she was unprepared for the unusual sight. 
She grew pale, collapsed in a chair and had to be taken home. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not another country for us," Belenky said of her new home. "It is 
another planet." 
</P>
<P>
Her daughter, Dina, received a scholarship from a Jewish social service agency 
so she could attend ninth grade at the Einstein Academy in Van Nuys, a private 
school. Dina said the academy was a far cry from her school in Moscow, where a 
teacher, upon learning of her plans to emigrate, ripped her notebook to pieces 
in front of the class and called her a traitor. 
</P>
<P>
Sophia, a construction engineer, and her husband are looking for work. They 
have met with a vocational counselor and have sent out resumes. 
</P>
<P>
To perfect their English, they read newspapers each morning and watch movies at 
night. They go to synagogue and have attended their first bar mitzvah. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an unforgettable day -- for that boy and for us," Sophia Belenky said. 
"Our dream in Moscow was to be Jewish, not to be shy about our origin. Now, we 
are proud that we are Jewish. I can go to the temple and my daughter can go to 
Jewish school." 
</P>
<P>
But life in Los Angeles is not without problems. Housing is expensive and child 
care is difficult to find. 
</P>
<P>
Some refugees come to the United States with advanced academic degrees, but 
language barriers often stand between them and well-paying positions, said Bea 
Gordon, a resettlement counselor for Jewish Vocational Services. Workers were 
assigned jobs in the Soviet Union, but here they have to compete for them. 
Resumes and interviews are a foreign concept. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a lot of expectations -- and rightly so," said social worker 
Champagne. "We've been fighting for their freedom for so long, but when they 
get here, it's not a yellow brick road." 
</P>
<P>
A former Soviet airline pilot in his mid-50s who has been in the United States 
for nearly a year is still looking for a job to support his family, Gordon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As a group, however, social workers say the Soviet emigres are highly skilled 
and motivated. Most find jobs within eight months with the help of Jewish 
social service agencies that arrange for classes in English as a second 
language, assist the refugees in preparing resumes, tell them how to dress for 
interviews and refer them to prospective employers. 
</P>
<P>
Counselors arrange for medical care and sponsor orientations that focus on how 
to get bank accounts, apply for government assistance and interest-free loans 
and arrange for utilities. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish agencies even sponsor social and cultural activities. There are Friday 
night Shabbat dinners and trips to popular plays, art exhibits and tourist 
attractions. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to familiarize them with the Jewish community in Los Angeles and 
to break down the barriers built over three generations where they have no 
contact with anything Jewish," Krisman said. "Even the idea of going to temple 
is foreign to some of them. In the Soviet Union, there is no organized Jewish 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Makaron's association for Soviet emigres, which received a $65,000 grant from 
the city of West Hollywood this year, maintains an office on Santa Monica 
Boulevard that functions as a drop-in center where new arrivals can go for 
advice or assistance. There is a small library of Russian literature. A storage 
room is filled with clothing, food, furniture and household goods that have 
been donated for needy families. Mattresses rest against the walls and boxes of 
matzot are stacked to the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Association members are now working on a survival guide. It will provide 
information, in Russian, about banks, transportation, jobs and government 
services. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to build a bridge from our ethnic group to the community," Makaron 
said. "In 10 years, we shouldn't call ourselves Russian Jews. We'll be American 
Jews." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS OK FUNDS TO COMPLETE PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has authorized the expenditure of 
an additional $2.7 million to complete work at a 2,800-inmate prison near 
Castaic, which fell a year behind schedule because of toilets that would not 
flush and security doors that would not open. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the supervisors authorized $298,000 for additional construction 
management services, $189,000 for more construction staff and $67,000 for 
inspection of the facility's electronic control system. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum-security prison on the grounds of the Peter J. Pitchess Honor 
Rancho was originally budgeted for $131 million. Authorities had hoped the 
high-tech jail would ease the county's inmate overcrowding last spring, but it 
will not be completed until at least mid-February.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RULING PUT OFF IN DISPUTE BETWEEN CITY, 
POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge has postponed a ruling in a labor dispute between the 
Long Beach police union and city management, while indicating that she will 
side with the city. 
</P>
<P>
The 610-member Long Beach Police Officers Assn. is trying to stop the city from 
imposing a new contract without the union's consent. But at a Los Angeles court 
hearing Thursday, Judge Dzintra Janavs disagreed with the union's arguments, 
saying federal case law supported the city's actions. 
</P>
<P>
She decided however, that the city had not given the union adequate notice that 
it was going to declare an impasse in the 9-month-old bargaining talks and 
adopt its final contract offer. Dzintra told the city to give the union its 
final contract position to allow the membership to vote on it before the next 
court hearing. In the meantime, the city has agreed not to implement the 
provisions of the new contract.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 8 NEW COUNTS FILED IN THREATS AGAINST 
CARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight additional felony charges have been filed against a Milwaukee man accused 
of trying to extort $5 million from entertainer Johnny Carson, officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Orville Gause, 36, was charged in Burbank Municipal Court on Wednesday with 
four counts of making terrorist threats and four of sending threatening letters 
to Carson, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert L. Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
Gause earlier pleaded not guilty to one charge of making terrorist threats and 
one charge of sending threatening letters to the talk show host. Gause was 
arrested Dec. 6 when he showed up at NBC studios in Burbank demanding to see 
Carson, police said. Network security guards apprehended Gause, who was armed 
with a sock filled with gravel.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PICKETERS DEMAND GM PLEDGE TO RETAIN PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
General Motors auto workers demonstrated Thursday outside GM's long-embattled 
Van Nuys plant, demanding that the company make a formal commitment to keep the 
plant open or face a consumer boycott campaign against its cars. 
</P>
<P>
The status of the Van Nuys plant, which employs about 3,600 workers and is one 
of only two remaining auto assembly plants in California, was thrown into limbo 
two months ago when GM formally confirmed years of speculation that the plant 
would not be chosen to build the next generation of Chevrolet Camaro and 
Pontiac Firebirds in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
A GM spokesman said Thursday that the march was premature because the 
corporation has no stated intent of closing the plant. Executives say they are 
studying options for the plant, including converting it to a "flexible" 
facility that would build a variety of models.

POOR TO GET 2ND CHANCE TO ENROLL IN FEDERAL RENT SUBSIDY PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Overwhelmed by more than 350,000 phone calls made by poor residents scrambling 
to enroll in a federal rent subsidy program, the Los Angeles Housing Authority 
announced Thursday that applicants will be given a second chance to sign up in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
The agency on Tuesday reopened the enrollment period for the popular Section 8 
program after a three-year hiatus but gave people only four days to apply, 
setting off a near-panic as tens of thousands tried to call two phone numbers 
that were perpetually busy. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question our phones have been overwhelmed, and we will be reopening 
the enrollment period in January," said Carl Covitz, chairman of the Housing 
Authority Commission. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the current enrollment period will continue until this evening. 
</P>
<P>
Covitz also said that "word has not gotten out" to thousands of families who 
could have registered in person at 18 senior citizen centers but, lacking the 
addresses, spent hours unsuccessfully dialing the agency to enroll in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Section 8 provides rental assistance to poor families, the disabled and the 
elderly. Participants are required to pay only 30% of their income toward rent, 
while the government pays the difference, up to fair market value, often 
helping cut rental costs in half. 
</P>
<P>
The reprieve, supported by Mayor Tom Bradley, was welcomed by many of the poor, 
who expressed disgust over the chaos they encountered when trying to apply. 
</P>
<P>
"I called one senior citizen center, and they insisted that somebody had to 
come there in person, which is completely asinine in my opinion and 
discriminatory against people who are sick," said Bernhard Sandler, 69, a 
Venice resident who recently underwent chemotherapy and was too ill to leave 
his home. 
</P>
<P>
One disabled Pasadena resident, who said he has been trying to get a Section 8 
subsidy for seven years, said he was "about ready to give up" Thursday after 
spending three days on the phone but getting only a recording used by the phone 
company when circuits are busy. 
</P>
<P>
"The phone numbers must be out of order," he said, exasperated. "Somebody must 
have made a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Before enrollment reopens on an undetermined date in January, Covitz said the 
agency will launch a publicity campaign to tell applicants to enroll in person. 
Because of confusion created by using senior citizen centers for walk-in 
applications, he said, many younger poor people did not apply this week at the 
centers, even though lines were relatively short. 
</P>
<P>
"Next time, we need to get out the message that this (sign-up) is not only for 
the elderly, this is for anyone at all" who meets eligibility requirements, 
Covitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) attacked the 
four-day enrollment period as unfair to the city's poorest residents, who lack 
telephones, televisions and may not have heard about it. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Roberti praised the extension of the enrollment period but urged 
housing officials to continue accepting phone calls and walk-in applicants 
through December. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a tragedy" if shutting down now created even more confusion and 
discouraged applicants, Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify for the Section 8 program, a household must have an income of no 
more than $13,950 for a single person, $15,950 for a couple and $19,950 for a 
family of four. Individuals who enroll are not guaranteed a rent subsidy but 
will be placed on the first waiting list to be formed in three years. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be so many people on the list that there's no chance that they will 
all be selected," Covitz warned. 
</P>
<P>
About 23,000 households currently are served.

The Soviet Union said today it will slash military spending by more than 8% 
next year and gave the most detailed breakdown to date of its armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov said at a news conference that the 8.2% cut, to $115 
billion, is part of a program of shifting the Soviet armed forces from an 
offensive to a more defensive role. 
</P>
<P>
The number of men in the armed force as of Jan. 1 will be 3,993,000, he said, 
without specifying what category of personnel the figure included. 
</P>
<P>
"The new political thinking in defense doctrines allowed the military to reduce 
the budget in practical terms," said Chervov.

Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, one of the most powerful drug traffickers in the 
world, was killed today during a shootout with police, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Rodriguez Gacha, his 17-year-old son Freddy and 11 of his 
bodyguards were shot to death near the Colombian port of Covenas, on the 
Caribbean about 75 miles south of Cartagena. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Carlos Casadiego, subdirector of the national police in Covenas, confirmed 
the death of Rodriguez Gacha, who is No. 2 in the notorious Medellin cartel, 
and the 12 others but had no further details. 
</P>
<P>
Pablo Escobar, the leader of the Medellin cartel, remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez Gacha and Escobar have been sought by U.S. and Colombian authorities 
since President Virgilio Barco Vargas ordered a crackdown on drug traffickers 
following the August slaying of a leading opposition presidential candidate.

President Bush pressed "the real thing" when he switched on the National 
Christmas Tree, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today, but he hesitated when 
asked the same question about former President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
"I better let that go," Fitzwater said when asked if Reagan had used a phony 
button in the years that he lit the tree from the safety of a White House 
balcony, several hundred yards from the tree. 
</P>
<P>
"Is your non-answer an answer?" he was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, sort of," responded Fitzwater, who served as press spokesman to Reagan 
before taking on the same assignment with Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about this year's ceremony, Fitzwater asserted without hesitation: "Last 
night was the real thing." 
</P>
<P>
Bush lit the 35-foot national tree Thursday night in person at a public outdoor 
ceremony on the Ellipse. During his eight years in office, Reagan stayed within 
the White House complex for the ceremony, supposedly lighting the Christmas 
tree by remote control.

ROSEANNE CALLS OFF WEDDING; BOYFRIEND IS IN DRUG CLINIC

<P>
Roseanne Barr, television's sharp-tongued comedy mom of the 1980s, called off 
her January wedding, explaining in a terse statement today that her boyfriend 
was in a drug rehabilitation clinic. 
</P>
<P>
"My Jan. 20 marriage to Tom Arnold is off," Barr said. "Tom has entered an 
alcohol and drug rehabilitation clinic." 
</P>
<P>
The statement was the only comment from the star of "Roseanne," her publicist, 
Lisa Kasteler, said. The name and location of the rehabilitation clinic were 
confidential, and the type of addiction wasn't disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
The temperamental Barr, 36, recently protested the firing of Arnold as a 
consultant to the show and she has stated publicly that she intends to leave 
television soon. 
</P>
<P>
Her TV departure will come even if her first motion picture outing, "She-Devil" 
with Meryl Streep, is a box office flop. It placed fourth in this week's box 
office derby with a disappointing $3.5-million take. 
</P>
<P>
The couple went to great lengths in recent months to express their devotion 
during appearances together on TV shows. During taping of "A Current Affair" in 
August, Arnold dropped his pants and exposed a backside tattoo reading, 
"Rosey."

<P>
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted today to increase transit 
fares, raising the New York City subway fare from $1 to $1.15. 
</P>
<P>
The new fares, most of which represent an increase of about 15%, take effect 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
They range from the 15-cent increase for subways and buses to a 50-cent rise to 
$4 for express buses in Queens and Staten Island and an 85-cent increase to 
$6.35 for the JFK airport express train. 
</P>
<P>
The board approved the changes as demonstrators waved signs protesting the fare 
hike and chanted, "Do the right thing! Stop the fare hike!" One sign-holder was 
hustled from the hearing room after he approached the table where the board 
members were seated. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the Transit Authority had proposed sending bus and subway fares to 
$1.25 with discount packages of 18 selling for $20.

The Communist Party will give up its monopoly on power and allow independent 
parties to compete in free elections next year, according to a draft 
declaration published today. 
</P>
<P>
It also called for a new constitution that guarantees market-oriented economic 
reforms, respect for human rights and an independent judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
Some opponents of change have maintained that independent parties would be 
formed along ethnic lines and further exacerbate ethnic tensions in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
But the declaration, prepared for adoption at next month's national party 
congress and published by the daily newspaper Borba, indicates that Yugoslavia 
wants to join the wave of democratic reforms sweeping Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the Communist leadership of Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six 
republics, was a staunch opponent of Western-style democracy. 
</P>
<P>
But at its regional congress today, Serbia's Communist Party appeared to have 
softened its hard-line stance. 
</P>
<P>
Bogdan Trifunovic, the republic's party chief, said in a keynote address that 
Communists and Serbian authorities "have no reason or wish to administratively 
impede the establishment" of other political parties in the republic. 
</P>
<P>
The second-largest republic of Croatia and the liberal northern state of 
Slovenia have already endorsed democratic reforms, and both are to hold free 
legislative elections in the spring.

SAKHAROV PRAISED AS CHAMPION OF FREEDOM

<TEXT>
<P>
World leaders from President Bush to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today 
praised Andrei D. Sakharov as a tremendous force for freedom who outlived his 
Soviet persecutors and saw the liberty he championed take root throughout 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old scientist and human rights activist died Thursday of an 
apparent heart attack in his Moscow apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Congress stood for a minute of silence for their colleague, once 
considered a national hero for discovering the Soviet hydrogen bomb but later 
reviled by Kremlin leadership for his uncompromising stands for human freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who freed the physicist from seven years of internal exile, called 
Sakharov a "man of conviction and sincerity." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great loss," Gorbachev said. "He was a person who had his own ideas, 
his own convictions which he expressed openly and directly. This doesn't mean I 
agreed with him, although on many things we did agree." 
</P>
<P>
One Soviet lawmaker called Sakharov a man "such as maybe appears once in a 
hundred years." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that "all of us are diminished" and that Sakharov "embodied all of 
what is good and decent in the human spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in a message of condolence to Sakharov's widow, Yelena Bonner, said: "All 
of us who knew him will never forget his courage and devotion to freedom. . . . 
Just as he truly enriched all of us with his life, all of us are diminished by 
his untimely death." 
</P>
<P>
Aase Lionaes, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that awarded Sakharov 
the Peace Prize in 1975, said he "fell in the struggle for democratic reforms. 
His death represents a great loss, especially at a time with hopes of a 
positive development in the Soviet Union and in all Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Political leaders worldwide commended Sakharov as a man whose causes went 
beyond ideology. 
</P>
<P>
Lech Walesa, a fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said Sakharov's death was "a 
great loss for reform both in the Soviet Union and everywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
"He was just a remarkable person," said British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher. "He was one of those who would always say the truth must be found and 
was never afraid of stating that and letting everyone know." 
</P>
<P>
"It is just sad he will not be preeminent in the freer future of the Soviet 
Union," she told reporters in London. 
</P>
<P>
In Strasbourg, France, the 518-member European Parliament unanimously paid 
tribute to Sakharov, whose name it had given to its Human Rights Prize. 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, the NATO foreign ministers hailed Sakharov as a pioneer who helped 
change Soviet society. NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said, "The 
ministers expressed deeply felt sense of loss at the passing of Andrei 
Sakharov."

GM PURCHASES 50% OF SAAB; JOINT CAR PRODUCTION PLANNED

Saab-Scania AB stunned the automobile world today by agreeing to sell 50% of 
its Saab auto division to General Motors Corp. for $600 million and set up a 
venture with GM to produce cars together. 
</P>
<P>
Saab has been hit by weak sales in recent years despite its long-standing image 
as a maker of quality autos, and its diversified parent has been seeking a 
partner to invest in the company. 
</P>
<P>
The pact with GM, the world's largest car maker, came as a surprise since Saab 
was widely expected to complete a deal with Italy's Fiat SpA. 
</P>
<P>
Saab was driven to find a partner by a turndown linked to price increases and 
intense competition. Its relatively small size has been a handicap in an 
industry increasingly dominated by a handful of global car makers building up 
for the unification of European Community markets in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
GM has made strong gains in Europe in recent years while its domestic business 
has fallen into a serious slump. The Saab purchase was viewed as a move to 
consolidate its gains in Europe and shore up its quality image at home.

biggest imbalance in 10 months, as imports climbed to a record level, the 
government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the October deficit was 19.8% higher than the 
September imbalance of $8.51 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The worsening trade balance reflected a big jump in imports, which climbed 5.1% 
to an all-time high of $41.21 billion. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports were also up, by 1.1%, rising to $31.01 billion. The trade deficit 
is the difference between imports and exports. 
</P>
<P>
A worsening in the trade deficit had been expected, given that imports normally 
shoot up in October as merchants restock shelves in preparation for Christmas. 
The size of the increase, however, caught many economists by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 10 months of the year, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit is 
running at an annual rate of $109.4 billion, down a modest 7.7% from last 
year's deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The overall October deficit of $10.2 billion was the largest since a 
$10.8-billion deficit last December. 
</P>
<P>
At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that, despite 
the October increase in the trade deficit, the deficit for January through 
October was $91.2 billion, "down $6 billion from the trade deficit for the 
first 10 months of 1988." 
</P>
<P>
"So it's still moving in the right direction," he said. "We're doing exactly 
the right thing, and no changes are necessary at this time."

INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION INCHES UP

Industrial production edged up 0.1% in November, rebounding from the effects of 
the Boeing aircraft strike and the San Francisco Bay Area earthquake a month 
earlier, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
But without the one-time special effects, production would have been little 
changed, and analysts said it reflected a growing sluggishness in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser for the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, 
Pa., said the sluggishness, which started in the auto industry several months 
ago, is broad-based in the manufacturing sector of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"As a result, for the next several months, industrial production is going 
nowhere and, if anything, going slightly down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chimerine and other economists suggested that the Federal Reserve should ease 
interest rates to stimulate the economy, particularly in view of recent reports 
that inflation is moderating.

<P>
A woman who sent more than 5,000 written death threats to actor Michael J. Fox 
pleaded guilty today to three counts of making terrorist threats. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Commissioner Sam Bubrick immediately sentenced Tina M. 
Ledbetter, 26, to three years' probation and ordered her to undergo psychiatric 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Bubrick also freed Ledbetter from custody, where she had been since March. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Ledbetter, a Westlake Village shipping clerk, began sending 
Fox the death threats in early 1988 because she was upset over the actor's 
marriage to actress Tracy Pollan. 
</P>
<P>
Fox, 27, rose to fame through the NBC sitcom "Family Ties." He went on to star 
in a number of movies including "Back to the Future," "Bright Lights, Big 
City," and this year's "Casualties of War" and "Back to the Future Part 2."

SALLY FIELD CAN'T HIDE HER AGE SINCE MILLIONS WATCHED HER GROW UP ON TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LOU CEDRONE, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's this? "Gidget" is playing the mother of a grown daughter in "Steel 
Magnolias"? How can that be? 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" Sally Field said. "I'm not too young to play the mother of an adult. 
I have a son who is only one year younger than Julia Roberts is in real life. 
Julia is 21. My son is 20. I had him when I was 23, which is why I never 
hesitate to reveal my age. I'm 43. That's how old I am. This is how I look. 
This is what happens when you have a child in your 20s." 
</P>
<P>
Someone said that other actresses lie about their ages, so why shouldn't she? 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is," Field said, "I can't lie about my age. Everybody has watched me 
grow up. I could never get away with it. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to 
figure out my age." 
</P>
<P>
She is frequently asked about how it all began, how Field became the television 
star, then the movie star, then the movie star with her own company. Legend has 
it that she was approached on the street by an agent who was looking for 
someone to play the title role in "Gidget," the television series. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, she had enrolled in a film studio workshop, and it was there that an 
agent spotted her. She was tested and did "Gidget." That lasted one year. A few 
years later, she did "The Flying Nun." It lasted three years. 
</P>
<P>
"The career was just presented to me on a plate," she said. "It was like a 
calling. I never even went to college." 
</P>
<P>
She plays Roberts' mother in "Steel Magnolias," the fictionalized story of a 
young woman, a diabetic, who goes against the advice of her doctors, has a 
child and dies from the complications. Dolly Parton, Shirley MacLaine, Daryl 
Hannah and Olympia Dukakis are in the cast of the film. 
</P>
<P>
According to Field, she and the other women got along like country girls at a 
quilting bee. "We did," she said. "We stayed up all night. We talked and played 
games, that sort of thing. We were a raunchy group, rude, crude and lewd. I 
don't think that need ever dies, the need for companionship. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, the movie is about friendship. There is nothing more tragic than losing 
a child, and when you do, you need friends. We need each other. We need to be 
touched. That's what the film is about."

AMERICAN TO FEATURE CNN NEWS -- MINUS AIR CRASHES 
</P>

American Airline flights will feature taped CNN newscasts without pictures of 
plane crashes after CBS balked at the airline's request that it cut such 
stories from its in-flight programs. 
</P>
<P>
American did not renew its six-year contract with the "CBS Morning News," and 
the last program will be shown on the airline before Feb. 28, said David 
Berman, a vice president at CBS Broadcast International. 
</P>
<P>
Under American's guidelines, he said, CBS has pulled entire news programs with 
reports of airline crashes or "virtually anything detrimental to the airlines." 
</P>
<P>
But CBS refused American's request to delete adverse airline news "and deliver 
the remainder of the show," he said. 
</P>
<P>
American's rationale may be to avoid alarming passengers, but "it's like 
passing out newspapers with holes cut in them," Berman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
American's decision to drop CBS was financial and wasn't based on an editorial 
dispute, said Mary O'Neill, a spokeswoman for the airline. "We didn't feel we 
were earning enough profit from our agreement with CBS," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said the new CNN arrangement, in which video portraying airline crashes 
will be deleted, was worked out after American's surveys showed that its 
passengers complained that pictures of airline crash scenes disturbed them. 
</P>
<P>
American's new in-flight agreement for Cable News Network newscasts is with 
Turner Home Entertainment, a division of Ted Turner's Atlanta-based cable 
empire that merchandises CNN productions. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 10 other airlines using CNN has asked for edited versions of the 
news, which is recorded from live feeds, a CNN spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
CNN is the only network with the capability to send live news feeds around the 
world to be taped for international flights.

PARAMOUNT VICTIMIZED BUCHWALD ON 'AMERICA' SCRIPT, JUDGE TOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Service Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attorney for columnist Art Buchwald denounced Paramount Pictures today as an 
unscrupulous movie studio that victimized Buchwald by stealing his script idea 
and turning it into the hit movie "Coming to America." 
</P>
<P>
"We seek substantial punitive damages to teach Paramount and others like it a 
lesson not to treat creative people like this ever again," attorney Pierce 
O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, the lawyer told Superior Court Judge Harvey 
Schneider, who will hear the case without a jury, that he will prove that 
Paramount took Buchwald's script idea entitled "King For A Day" and transformed 
it into the 1988 Eddie Murphy comedy, which grossed more than $150 million. The 
suit seeks $5 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, the attorney said, has already netted $22 million from the film and 
Paramount collected more than $50 million in distribution fees. But, he said, 
the studio refused to pay Buchwald and producer Alain Bernheim $250,000 plus a 
small share of profits under their original contract. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for Paramount, Robert Draper, ridiculed the idea that Buchwald's 
script idea was plagiarized. Draper acknowledged that during the year in which 
the case was pending, Murphy -- who is not a party in the suit -- admitted that 
he had seen Buchwald's proposal. But Murphy said he could not tell whether it 
influenced him subconsciously in writing his own script for "Coming to 
America." 
</P>
<P>
Personalities such as Buchwald, Murphy, director John Landis and Murphy's 
co-star Arsenio Hall are expected to testify in the two-week trial.

Having traveled to Africa and the Amazon jungle during a 14-month sabbatical, 
cartoonist Gary Larson should have even more loopy animals with which to draw 
his popular cartoon "The Far Side." 
</P>
<P>
The Universal Press Syndicate, which carries Larson's strip, kept busy during 
his absence, adding newspapers for a total of more than 900 that run the 
cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
Under his new schedule, Larson will produce five original panels a week, with 
reissues of old cartoons for the other two days. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had mixed feelings about being back at work; the first new cartoons 
will be published Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I currently feel fresh and recharged, and a reduced workload I'm sure will 
play a big role in maintaining that feeling," Larson said. "But, as I'm sure 
anyone who has had an opportunity to take a full year off will agree, that 
first Monday morning back to work is quite a sobering experience." 
</P>
<P>
Larson -- whose offbeat, bizarre humor features animated puns, animals that act 
like humans and vice versa -- took a break starting in October, 1988. Larson 
and his wife traveled extensively and spent four months in New York, where he 
studied jazz guitar. Their home is in Seattle.

Author Nicholas Gage says his writing skills were unleashed in a chance 
encounter with a salty-tongued teacher when he was a struggling, 13-year-old 
refugee. 
</P>
<P>
Gage writes in the Dec. 17 issue of Parade magazine how as a seventh-grader he 
met Marjorie Hurd Rabidou in Worcester, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Told to choose a hobby, Gage said he "decided to follow the prettiest girl in 
my class -- the blue-eyed daughter of the local Lutheran minister." 
</P>
<P>
"She led me through the door marked 'Newspaper Club' and into the presence of 
Miss Hurd, the newspaper adviser and English teacher who would become my mentor 
and my muse." 
</P>
<P>
Gage wrote an essay for the school paper about his mother, who was killed by 
Communists during the Greek civil war. Hurd sent it to the Freedoms Foundation 
in Valley Forge, Pa., where it won a medal. 
</P>
<P>
Gage was a reporter for The New York Times and later recorded his mother's life 
and death in the book "Eleni," and his father's story in "A Place for Us."

Pat Richter, who led the 1963 Wisconsin football team to the Rose Bowl, today 
was named the university's new athletic director and was charged with the task 
of turning around a financially troubled program. 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Donna E. Shalala announced Richter's appointment at a news 
conference, saying she is confident that Richter will solve the problem of the 
athletic department, including a million-dollar budget deficit, losing football 
program and declining football ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
Richter replaces Ade Sponberg, who resigned under pressure last month after 
just more than two years as athletic director. Sponberg will remain on the job 
until May 1. 
</P>
<P>
Richter, 48, who graduated from Wisconsin in 1963 and played eight seasons in 
the NFL with the Washington Redskins, is currently vice president for personnel 
at Oscar Mayer Foods Corp. in Madison. 
</P>
<P>
Shalala said Richter will immediately begin searching for a new football coach 
and assume his other responsibilities later. Don Morton was fired as coach late 
last month after compiling a 6-27 record over three years.

Cincinnati Bengals Coach Sam Wyche was hit with a substantial fine by the NFL 
today for his failure to allow reporters into the team's locker room after its 
loss to Seattle on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, in a letter to Wyche, said the fine was 
assessed because Wyche went against league policy and said he wouldn't rule out 
closing the locker room in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The league's media policy states that team locker rooms are to be opened after 
a brief waiting period, usually 5 to 7 minutes. But after Sunday's 24-17 loss 
to the Seahawks, Wyche closed the locker room, saying he wanted to avoid having 
coaches and players face questions about officiating calls contested by the 
coach during the game. 
</P>
<P>
The league declined to announce the amount of the fine. 
</P>
<P>
"We're fortunate the public is extremely interested in our teams and in the 
details of the game," said Joe Browne, the NFL's director of communications. 
"Our fans have a right to know how the players and coaches feel about events 
that occurred during our games." 
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Pro Football Writers of America said: "We are happy 
the league has reaffirmed how important it is for pro football to maintain an 
open relationship with its link to the public."

<P>
Dick Vermeil, selection chairman and former coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, 
said in making the announcement that Thompson "would be my first round draft 
pick" if he was still an active NFL coach.

Thompson beat out quarterback Andre Ware of the University of Houston, who won 
the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
Based on a scoring arrangement of three points for first, two for second and 
one for third, Thompson wound up with 1,398 points to Ware's 1,245. West 
Virginia's quarterback Major Harris received 712, Penn State running back Blair 
Thomas 390 and Notre Dame quarterback Tony Rice 389. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, a senior, set three new NCAA records -- most yards in a single game, 
377, against Wisconsin; career touchdowns, 65, and career points, 394.

JIM VALVANO WANTED CAMELOT BUT FAILED AND FELL BY WAYSIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
It was only 10 years ago that Jim Valvano appeared to be among the best and the 
brightest. He was a young basketball coach going out to prove that he could 
make his way work in the big time and make it work right. 
</P>
<P>
"Right" was his word. The emphasis was his too. 
</P>
<P>
He was going to North Carolina State University, which was to be Camelot on 
Hillsborough Street. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolfpack Club was holding its first-ever meeting in New York, and Jim 
Valvano was in the city Thursday. Valvano's image was tarnished, and he was 
defending himself and his program in the face of suspension and probation by 
the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
"Defending yourself," he said in a word, "is a bitch." 
</P>
<P>
As the ball bounces, he has not been a perfect master for the game that grips 
his campus. Neither is there evidence he is the charlatan of charlatans and 
scoundrel of scoundrels in the mess of college sports. 
</P>
<P>
For 11 months the NCAA, at the request of the school, examined published and 
unpublished charges that Valvano had supervised a program of severe and 
deliberate violations. 
</P>
<P>
What the investigation prompted by the book "Personal Fouls" revealed was 
secondary violations that could have been turned up in countless schools, and 
imposed what it called "the minimum schedule of penalties." 
</P>
<P>
What Valvano is most guilty of is disappointing expectations. Perhaps 
expectations were too high, too naive. 
</P>
<P>
He is a wonderful coach; his 1983 championship with an implausible team is 
evidence of that. He is a charmer -- a wit, a storyteller -- and he expresses 
more than a passing regard for the English language and related academic 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the best of all possible worlds," Valvano said when he had yet to make 
his footprints on Tobacco Road. "I want kids to be students. I want them to 
talk about things besides the back door. On the planes I want them to talk 
about the world problems, of oil. I want them to watch the presidential debates 
on TV and talk about that. I want the packed arena, the band playing, 
cheerleaders, and doing it with kids who are being educated and care about 
society. 
</P>
<P>
"I want that. And a national championship." 
</P>
<P>
He charmed more than just the media. "He is a man of vision and dynamics," said 
Robert Bryan, professor of philosophy and chairman of the search committee that 
chose Valvano. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't all worked out exactly as I would have liked," Valvano conceded 
Thursday. Of course, as head coach he is responsible for the violations. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't prevent improper distribution of the four tickets that each player 
may request for each home game. He didn't make sure that each player turned in 
one pair of $75 sneakers before he was issued a second pair that he could sell 
or trade for other goods. 
</P>
<P>
According to the infractions report, 650 tickets of the 7,200 issued in the 
four-year period studied were sold, with a total cash value "in excess of 
$1,000." 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA investigating committee said "it did not find that any clear and 
direct competitive advantage accrued" to the N.C. State program. 
</P>
<P>
It did not find substance in the allegations of deceptive drug-testing, of 
checkbook recruiting or altering of grades to keep players eligible. 
</P>
<P>
N.C. State cannot play this season in the big tournament, which paid the school 
$707,000 last season. It did not bar N.C. State from television; it did not 
demand a firing. 
</P>
<P>
For what the investigation found, Bryan concluded, Valvano should be spanked 
rather than pilloried. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was a dynamic, open, honest man," he said by phone from his home 
in Raleigh. "He's still dynamic, open and, I'd still like to believe, honest. 
He could have done better than he did; he's not a scoundrel." 
</P>
<P>
Valvano works under two shadows that don't pass. One is that he recruited Chris 
Washburn with his 470 SAT score and a questionable deportment record. He turned 
out to be a fine basketball player but a thief and, ultimately, a drug violator 
as a professional after leaving school. 
</P>
<P>
It was a time before the 700 SAT rule was instituted. 
</P>
<P>
And Valvano is so glib, so clever, so amusing that everybody knows he can't be 
on the level. His players had too much fun -- he had too much fun -- and they 
had too much freedom during their championship tournament. But sometimes a 
used-car salesman tells the truth. "I don't think Valvano is a charlatan," 
Bryan said. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of the furor over the book, the chancellor of the university 
resigned. The new chancellor took away Valvano's position as athletic director, 
putting a watchdog over the coach, which pleased the NCAA. The new chancellor 
also set policy that all freshman athletes must live with the greater student 
body, not in special athletic housing. "A commendable approach," the NCAA said. 
All schools ought to ban freshman eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 700 rule was enacted, N.C. State has -- by policy -- not accepted an 
SAT casualty in any sport, which neither Notre Dame nor Michigan can claim. "I 
feel strongly that grade-fixing didn't happen," Bryan said. "Some charges I 
thought were grotesque, and that's what they turned out to be. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my not-unbiased belief that we aren't nearly as bad as lots and lots of 
places. Jim Valvano is not guilty of cheating; he could have done better than 
he did. He has so many virtues that it's terribly distressing that his vices 
caught up to him. I think it is true of virtually everybody that their greatest 
virtues are their greatest vices. He was devil-may-care, but the devil needs to 
care." 
</P>
<P>
Valvano's failure is that he didn't make Camelot and cared to accept less. 
</P>
<P>
"The things I said then about athletes being aware and concerned students," he 
said, "are a tough ideal to live up to. Forget about the ballplayers; we have a 
lot of kids who come in and just want to be accountants." 
</P>
<P>
He cited the darkness in education reported in "The Closing of the American 
Mind." He read it. It's a problem of education; it's a symptom of 
student-athletes who don't care to be students and of coaches who don't care 
either. 
</P>
<P>
The crime isn't that Valvano is the worst of them; it's that 10 years ago he 
looked like the best of them.

SAM WHO TO HEAD FIELD OF 4 IN SPRINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A field of four headed by Sam Who was entered in Saturday's $100,000-added 
National Sprint Championship at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Who will be ridden by Laffit Pincay and was assigned 122 pounds for the 
ninth running of the six-furlong race for 3-year-olds and up. 
</P>
<P>
Others entered were Order, who will be ridden by Aaron Gryder and was assigned 
122 pounds; Olympic Prospect, who will be ridden by Alex Solis and was assigned 
120 pounds, and Ron Bon, who will be ridden by Gary Stevens and was assigned 
116 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Who will make his first start since his fourth-place finish and subsequent 
disqualification for interference after the start in the Breeders' Cup on Nov. 
4. He set the track record this spring sprinting six furlongs in 1:08 flat May 
20. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic Prospect, known for his speed away from the gate, is expected to try to 
jump to a big lead in the short field and hold off any late challenges. The 
John Sadler trainee comes into the stake off an easy one and one-quarter length 
win in 1:08.2 Dec. 3, only two-fifths off Sam Who's record. 
</P>
<P>
If all four entries go to the post, the total purse will be $105,200 and the 
winner will collect $60,200.

11 INJURED IN RUNAWAY TRUCK CRASH IN EL TORO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Eleven people were injured this morning after a runaway big-rig truck hauling 
24 tons of dirt plowed into a worker's trailer, causing a chain reaction that 
involved eight cars, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody was seriously injured in the 7:50 a.m. accident that left a tangled mess 
of trucks, cars, dirt and oil and tied up morning traffic on Lake Forest Drive 
and Trabuco Road -- one of the busiest intersections in El Toro -- for hours, 
CHP Officer Raul Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
"It blocked the entire intersection," Martinez said, adding that traffic was 
rerouted to residential streets while police and county workers scooped up tons 
of dirt, and hauled mangled automobiles and truck parts away. 
</P>
<P>
The runaway truck was completely demolished. 
</P>
<P>
Police and witnesses said that the accident occurred when trucker Kevin 
Johnson's brakes failed as he was driving the heavy rig downhill on Lake Forest 
Drive from a construction site at the north end of the road. Johnson realized 
that he could not stop the twin-trailer dirt hauler when he applied his brakes 
at a red light at Trabuco Road. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, co-worker Robert Kettleson, 31, of Corona was sitting in an 
identical truck waiting for the light to change. Six cars and a van were also 
idling at the light waiting to cross Trabuco Road, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, realizing that he would not be able to stop, steered toward the rear 
trailer of Kettleson's truck, authorities said. The rig slammed into the 
trailer, and then ricocheted to the left, smashing into the van and another 
car. As it hopped the center divider, the truck hit a black Toyota. The cab 
then "disintegrated," Sgt. Mike Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a slight jolt," Kettleson said. "I thought maybe a car hit me. But then 
I saw Kevin's cab fly right by my window. I watched it fall apart." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was able to crawl away from the ruined truck. The engine, still 
smoking, was torn from the twisted frame and landed a few feet from Johnson, 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was listed in fair condition at Mission Hospital Regional Medical 
Center, hospital spokeswoman Nancy Gasho said. 
</P>
<P>
Another driver was taken to that hospital, police said. The others were taken 
to Saddleback Memorial Medical Center. Their names were not immediately 
available. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer William Martin said only five of the 10 brakes on the truck were 
operable. Henry Uyekawa, owner of the truck, said the drivers were responsible 
for adjusting the brakes on the rigs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real unfortunate thing," Uyekawa said. "I really feel bad about 
this." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was cited for failing to adjust his brakes, Martin said.

<P>
A man shot by a Westminster police officer died of his wounds, authorities said 
today. The man had pointed a handgun at officers who were searching for three 
suspects in a gang-related drive-by shooting, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office was investigating the incident 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Tom Broderson said the fatal shooting occurred around 9:20 
p.m. at Alcester Street and Sinclair Avenue, about three blocks north of a 
scene of a drive-by shooting 15 minutes earlier. Three alleged gang members had 
fired about 10 to 15 shots at five people standing in front of a residence in 
the 14000 block of Starsia Street, Broderson said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the man confronted officers who were searching the neighborhood for the 
three suspects. "He pointed a handgun at officers who fired one shot," 
Broderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The slain suspect, whose name is being withheld pending notification of next of 
kin, was taken to Fountain Valley Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
Broderson said he could not say whether the slain man was involved in the 
drive-by shooting.

SOVIETS TO CUT MILITARY BUDGET BY 8% IN 1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union said today it will slash military spending by more than 8% 
next year and gave the most detailed breakdown to date of its armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov said at a news conference that the 8.2% cut, to $115 
billion, is part of a program of shifting the Soviet armed forces from an 
offensive to a more defensive role. 
</P>
<P>
The number of men in the armed force as of Jan. 1 will be 3,993,000, he said, 
without specifying what category of personnel the figure included. 
</P>
<P>
"The new political thinking in defense doctrines allowed the military to reduce 
the budget in practical terms," said Chervov, head of a general staff 
department. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the complete armed forces budget had been given to 
foreign journalists before publication in the official Soviet press. 
</P>
<P>
Military spending this year amounted to $129 billion, according to the first 
fully disclosed figures for defense expenditure, released in June. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet armed forces as of Jan. 1 will be equipped with 4,045 missile 
launchers of all kinds, 10,000 missile warheads, 63,900 tanks, 8,207 combat 
aircraft and 157 major surface ships, according to the breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
Chervov said that offensive weapons are being reduced, that operational 
training is being revised and that most major military maneuvers have been cut. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has already begun cutting the country's 
armed forces in an attempt to lessen international tension and free much-needed 
funds to help modernize the outdated Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We were guided by (Gorbachev's policy of openness). The cuts are one way of 
building confidence," Chervov said. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago Gorbachev told the United Nations that 500,000 troops would be cut 
from the Soviet armed forces. Chervov said 256,000 of the half million men have 
already gone.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: AS COMEDY, HA! IS ONLY HO-HUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not scheduled to debut until April 1. But HA! The TV Comedy Network 
already seems like a bad joke. 
</P>
<P>
A rival of HBO's month-old Comedy Channel, the 24-hour HA! is a creation of MTV 
Networks, which also operates cable's rock-music channel MTV. Whereas MTV began 
life in 1981 as an innovator that energized the music business by weaving rock 
videos into the fabric of television, however, HA! is beginning life as a 
renovator. 
</P>
<P>
A renovator of network sitcoms. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happened to the notion that cable should be an alternative to regular 
TV, not an echo? 
</P>
<P>
From all appearances, HA! is largely an echo. Although planning to develop 
original programming as well, it will open with a lineup that includes this 
orgy of reruns: "The Betty White Show" (1977-78), "The Tony Randall Show" 
(1976-78), "The Texas Wheelers" (1974-75), "Rhoda" (1974-78), "Phyllis" 
(1975-77), "The Lucy Show" (1962-74), "That Girl" (1966-71), "The Duck Factory" 
(1984), "TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes" (1984-88) and "Love, American 
Style" (1969-74). 
</P>
<P>
What's more, HA! plans to rerun the CBS miniseries "Fresno" -- whose satire 
won't be any wittier now than when it first ran in 1986 or reran last July -- 
and HA! has "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and "The Bob Newhart Show" on hold 
until 1992 and 1993, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity in the quality of these acquisitions is great, ranging from 
grossly unfunny "Love, American Style" to "The Mary Tyler Show," which ranks 
among the best sitcoms ever. The point is not whether the reruns are good, bad 
or mediocre, however, but that they are reruns -- used and reused goods, many 
of them already so well-traveled in syndication that they probably won't be 
fresh even to the young audience targeted by HA! 
</P>
<P>
Besides, sitcoms already consume nearly half of prime time on the Big Three and 
Fox networks. Plus you have all those comedy reruns in pre-prime time, as well 
as the ancient sitcoms airing nightly on that other MTV Networks channel, 
Nickelodeon/Nick at Night. Moreover, Nickelodeon will soon be rerunning 
episodes of "The White Shadow," adding to cable another former network dramatic 
series like those already being aired on the Lifetime and USA networks. 
</P>
<P>
So where is the justification for a new network foisting still more reruns on 
viewers? 
</P>
<P>
HBO's The Comedy Channel -- delivering round-the-clock brief excerpts from 
videos, movies and stand-up comics -- is not much to laugh about either. 
Moreover, sometimes you can't distinguish the program from its ads, as in a 
comedy clip from the new movie "Steel Magnolias" flowing into a commercial for 
the new movie "Back to the Future Part II." In fact, The Comedy Channel is 
itself one massive commercial, just as MTV is a commercial for the music and 
rock bands it will continue to feature in its soon-to-be-revamped format. 
</P>
<P>
In partially relying on stand-up comedy, The Comedy Channel has become an 
extension of a 1980s trend that has seen both regular TV as well as cable's 
HBO, Showtime and the Arts &amp; Entertainment network evolve into an 
electronic Catskills, exposing America to comics of all shapes and stripes. The 
stage is broad, and not all the comics are funny. Take the bad ones -- please! 
</P>
<P>
Better The Comedy Channel, though, than comedy dominated by reruns. 
</P>
<P>
Not that reruns are the sum of HA! It also has on its agenda a new series 
involving the famed Second City repertory company, and it has production deals 
with Castle Rock Entertainment ("When Harry Met Sally. . .") and MTM 
Enterprises, which years ago gave America "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and other 
superior comedies. Glints of hope? We'll see. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps HA! will turn out to be more exciting than it appears on paper. As for 
now, however, its rerun philosophy seems to symbolize the merging of new 
technologies and old ideas. 
</P>
<P>
The promise of cable has always been new horizons and new attitudes, a way of 
doing things separated from the rest of television by the widest of gaps. And 
indeed it has provided some exhilarating diversity, from early MTV itself to 
CNN to some of the original programming on HBO that has been far bolder than 
anything on regular TV. The list doesn't stop there, but it is a short list. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a plethora of channel options, what we have, increasingly, is more of 
the familiar, a gleaming technology providing us with little more than 
different means of watching essentially what we've always watched. And as the 
dreams of cable and regular TV become interchangeable, as do the executives who 
dream them, you wonder about the future. 
</P>
<P>
On board at HA! as a consultant is Fred Silverman. Yes, the Fred Silverman, the 
multi-lived former programming guru at CBS, ABC and NBC, and now an independent 
producer whose current credits include "Matlock," "In the Heat of the Night," 
"Father Dowling Mysteries" and "Jake and the Fatman." 
</P>
<P>
The gap narrows.
