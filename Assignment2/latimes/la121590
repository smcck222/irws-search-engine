BILL BOYARSKY: THE BACK ROOM DRAMA OF REDISTRICTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Next month, the Legislature begins the messy process of drawing new boundaries 
for congressional and legislative districts. 
</P>
<P>
I've always found redistricting, which occurs after every Census, to be one of 
politics' most fascinating back room dramas, although it's a tough sell to 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
Friends destroy each other for the sake of a favorable district. Old scores are 
settled. The Republicans you see cursing Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown in public make deals with him in private to assure themselves of 
districts with boundaries favorable enough to guarantee election. 
</P>
<P>
This, however, is insider stuff. Even legislators admit that they're seen by 
many constituents as remote figures who don't particularly affect peoples' 
lives. So editors and reporters figure a redistricting story can be counted on 
to send readers fleeing to the comics. 
</P>
<P>
But there are a few localities where reapportionment is alive and relevant, 
touching deep community feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Such a community is Monterey Park. There, Mayor Judy Chu is leading a fight for 
an Assembly district where an Asian-American can be elected. It would be 
centered in Monterey Park, where 39% of the voters are Asian. 
</P>
<P>
No telling how much back room bloodletting this proposal might cause. Two other 
Democratic legislators have districts in the area, Xavier Bacerra of Monterey 
Park and Sally Tanner of El Monte. Latinos won't give up the Bacerra seat. And 
Tanner's been loyal to Speaker Brown, who's a power in redistricting. Brown 
taking away her district would be a classic example of reapportionment 
back-stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect that we will reach an easy resolution," Chu said, "but we do 
want to work with people as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The fight is more difficult because Asians have lagged behind Latinos in 
political organizing. That's not surprising. Discriminatory laws prevented 
Asian immigrants from becoming naturalized citizens until 1952. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, there were relatively few Asian immigrants until President 
Lyndon B. Johnson signed the liberal 1965 immigration law. Before that, 
immigration from Asian nations had been restricted by a series of laws dating 
back to the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
The history helps explain Asian political weakness. European immigrants have 
been producing political leaders since the 19th Century, and blacks and Latinos 
began effective political organization after World War II. Asians didn't begin 
this process until the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Asian voter participation remains low. The last complete study -- by UCLA 
political scientists in 1986 -- showed 43% of the eligible Japanese-Americans 
in the county were registered to vote. This compares to a 60% registration rate 
county-wide. 
</P>
<P>
I asked Mayor Chu why she and the others were undertaking their fight. 
</P>
<P>
"What does it matter as long as the legislator is a good person?" I said. "What 
are the issues where the Asian community hasn't been represented because of the 
lack of Asian representatives in Sacramento?" 
</P>
<P>
Asians need someone in Sacramento, she said, to speak against discrimination. 
For example, Asians suspect their brightest high school graduates are being 
discriminated against in the competition for admission to UC Berkeley and UCLA; 
they believe officials fear Asians already are "overrepresented" at the 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"This would have been more of a public issue earlier," she said, if there had 
been an Asian legislator. 
</P>
<P>
UC officials deny there is any discrimination. But the perception remains in 
the Asian community, said Chu, sharpened by memories of previous government 
discrimination, including the old exclusion laws and the detention, just a 
half-century ago, of Japanese-Americans in World War II internment camps. 
</P>
<P>
Personal experiences add to Chu's determination. 
</P>
<P>
Chu is a thoughtful college professor who studied at UC Santa Barbara and UCLA, 
and has a doctorate in psychology. She was elected to the Garvey elementary 
school district board of education, and then to the Monterey Park City Council. 
She's one of the Southland's most prominent and promising Asian politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the success story is colored by discrimination. "I remember things like 
when I was young being called a Jap or a Chink all the time and being pushed in 
the street," she told me. "It's not something you like to talk about or even 
acknowledge." 
</P>
<P>
But it's enough to make her conscious of the constant danger of discrimination. 
And enough to propel her into the bloody back rooms of the redistricting fight.

Photo, Horribly Ever After: This wedding rehearsal may look like your ordinary 
horror show -- but it's for real. Stafford Mills, 26, who plays Frankenstein's 
monster on the Universal Studios Tour, today will wed co-worker Sheila 
Gavarrete, 21, who plays -- that's right -- the Bride of Frankenstein. At first 
they had planned a conventional ceremony, but studio executives -- alert to 
publicity opportunities -- offered to join them in unholy matrimony on the 
studio's back lot where the 1931 version of "Frankenstein" was filmed. The 
bride will wear a dead-snake garter. Fog will swirl, live wolves will bay and 
the groom will be led in on a chain. Said the Rev. Lawrence Keene, shown above 
in the monk's robe and wolf-fur collar he will wear as he performs the ceremony 
from behind a morgue slab: "They'll probably revoke my ordination papers for 
this." ROLANDO OTERO / Los Angeles Times; Photo, (Just for the record, photo at

<TEXT>
<P>
During the 1980s I can remember reading about the idolization of Donald Trump, 
Michael Milken, Charles Keating, Ronald Reagan, Neil Bush and countless other 
individuals who robbed and spent our country into a trillion-dollar debt. 
</P>
<P>
Now that we must pay back this huge debt, all of them are pulling out empty 
pockets and pointing their finger at someone else. 
</P>
<P>
I assert that the 1980s can be characterized as the "me" generation and the 
1990s can be characterized as the "not me" generation.

Sen. Inouye says the Keating Five were just trying to help their constituents. 
Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) had a lump in his throat and tears in his eyes 
from this statement. 
</P>
<P>
That's not bad; what's bad is the people who lost all their money will have 
nothing but lumps this Christmas season. The tears were a nice touch. 
</P>
<P>
But if you want to shed a tear, shed them for the thousands who lost their life 
savings and for the citizens who will have to pay the tab.

SCHOOL FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with great interest the Nov. 26 article "Gaps Between Rich, Poor Schools 
Ignite Legal Fights," which surveyed discrepancies in the funding of schools 
across the nation. I must disagree vehemently, however, with the contention 
that California has achieved virtual equalization in base school funding. 
</P>
<P>
While the state Supreme Court's Serrano decision went a long way toward 
achieving equal education funding for every child, it is an unfortunate fact 
that distressingly large discrepancies continue to exist. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in San Joaquin County, Lammersville and Jefferson school districts 
are next to each other and both feed into Tracy Union High School District. 
Yet, Jefferson annually receives $400 more per pupil, or $12,000 for a class of 
30. This situation is not unique. 
</P>
<P>
As a constitutional right, and simply as matter of fairness, every public 
school student should have access to a quality education, and where a child 
happens to live should make no difference. 
</P>
<P>
This year I carried SB-622, which sought to reduce differences in school 
funding between districts. The measure, supported by virtually all of the 
state's major educational organizations and a large number of school districts, 
received not one negative vote in the Legislature. Unfortunately, the governor 
vetoed the bill. 
</P>
<P>
I and other supporters of equalization plan to continue our efforts -- both 
through legislation and possibly through legal action -- to ensure that no 
child is denied the opportunity for quality education.

SEA WORLD'S IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I wanted to take a moment to clear up some misinformation in a Nov. 19 article 
on Sea World of California. I'm afraid your readers may well have been left 
with an incomplete picture of our efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The headline reads "Sinking Image? Sea World Navigates Rough Waters After 
Deaths of 6 Whales." Both the headline and a brief summary of the story in the 
Highlights column bear very little resemblance to the truth or to the Amy 
Wallace story they recount. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlights column suggests that as a result of animal deaths in the last 2 
1/2 years, a shadow has been cast over the morale of Sea World employees and 
that our attendance has suffered a related drop. Both implications are 
inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
I started with Sea World in its inaugural year and in more than 26 years with 
the park I have never seen employee morale higher. The millions of dollars in 
improvements made by Anheuser-Busch Inc. since its acquisition of Sea World 
last year are a source of great pride for our employees. 
</P>
<P>
As far as attendance, the three-year period outlined in the article has 
actually seen attendance at Sea World increase by more than 7% over the three 
previous years. 
</P>
<P>
To address the question of the death of animals, Sea World is, first and 
foremost, a zoological park. Animals are born and animals die at zoos and 
aquariums, just as they are born and die in the wild; to think otherwise is 
unreasonable. Since 1988, four killer whales have died at Sea World parks. 
Three were animals in their late 20s to early 30s and the fourth was Kandu, who 
sadly died of injuries suffered during normal social interaction. 
</P>
<P>
In the same time period, Sea World parks have seen the births of four killer 
whale calves, an unparalleled breeding program for the species. Clearly animals 
at Sea World experience the same natural ebb and flow as animals in the wild. 
</P>
<P>
The account of Sea World's involvement with the recent capture of a rare 
megamouth shark also was misleading. The suggestion that we refused to accept 
the animal because we wished to avoid a high-profile death is inaccurate and 
offensive. Sea World rescues, rehabilitates and releases hundreds of marine 
animals every year without regard to "image." We declined to accept the 
megamouth shark primarily because we do not have the facilities to properly 
care for it.

ETHICS HEARINGS AND CRANSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) played a more active and independent role than 
any of the other senators ("Cranston Was Most Active of Keating 5," front page, 
Dec. 10). So what's new? He always has on all issues, thank heavens. 
</P>
<P>
And so what? The testimony during the current Senate ethics hearings has more 
than proven that Cranston had every justification to inquire and question, at 
any time, the activities of the newly active regulators (where were they for 
six years?) when a constituent showed evidence of possible harassment and delay 
and damage to his business, no matter the contributions by that constituent. 
</P>
<P>
The deregulation and "profit at any cost and the public be damned" policies of 
the Reagan years, the greedy investors who chose not to look at the fine print 
to make a fast buck and the truly unethical conduct of the Neil Bushes caused 
the S&amp;L mess, not Sen. Cranston. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston should be lauded for his years of "active and independent" 
representation of the people of California and the nation, and for his 
dedication to voting rights and registration. We say, get the partisan 
hypocrites (are you listening, Sen. Warren Rudman?) off of his back and place 
the blame where it belongs. Leave our honorable senator alone!

<P>
Please, oh please, Marshal Phillips, stop blaming me, then everyone but the 
individual for personal misfortune. In his column about AIDS, Phillips blames 
the high infection rate among gay males to have partly resulted "by society's 
lack of support in promoting stable couples among that population." 
</P>
<P>
What about the other part -- the part about personal responsibility? Sorry, but 
I am not taking the blame for one more AIDS victim, drug addict, illiterate 
dropout, criminal or greedy deviant. 
</P>
<P>
As is easy to see, society is deteriorating at a frightening rate, producing 
and looking the other way at these weaknesses. And the rest of the population 
is forced to carry the burden of every over-aged, irresponsible crybaby who 
squeals. Enough!

WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phillips is welcome to his viewpoints on homosexuality, but I wish he would use 
the entire Bible and not just pick a questionable translation of I Corinthians 
6:9. Romans 1:26-27 says that God gave homosexuals up to vile passions because 
they left the natural use of the man or woman. 
</P>
<P>
Agree with it or not, but the Bible still teaches homosexuality is unnatural! 
</P>
<P>
Phillips' claim that Sodom was destroyed for "inhospitable treatment" to God's 
messengers is laughable. Genesis 18:20 says Sodom was destroyed because "their 
sin is very grievous." Genesis 19:4-6 states that the men of Sodom demanded the 
two angels of God "so they may know them carnally." I imagine Phillips is now 
going to say that homosexual rape is just "inhospitable treatment." 
</P>
<P>
I have only one thing to say to Marshall Phillips and the liberal scholars he 
quotes: "Professing to be wise, they became fools" (Romans 1:22).

Phillips perseveres in the massive propaganda effort of the homosexual 
community to persuade us that all the great scholars of Judeo-Christian 
morality for more than 3,000 years have misunderstood their own texts. Phillips 
makes much of the fact that the word arsenikoi to describe one of the classes 
of sinners condemned by St. Paul in I Corinthians, Chapter 6 -- and which was 
translated "homosexuals" in the Revised Standard Version of the New Testament 
-- has allegedly been shown by John Boswell of Yale to refer to bisexual male 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
But the synonym often given for this word in standard concordances is 
paederastoi. All of this is, however, irrelevant, because St. Paul's 
condemnation of both male and female homosexuality in the first chapter of the 
Letter to the Romans is unequivocal and unqualified.

I must take exception to the opinion piece by Phillips. There is a vast chasm 
between the laws of the United States and the laws of God as recorded in the 
Bible. 
</P>
<P>
It would be folly for anyone to attempt to use Scripture as the basis for civil 
liberties, either in justifying or denying them. It is folly, likewise, to use 
the Bible (whatever translation), in justifying homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
To conclude that the destruction of Sodom was a result of that city's 
mistreatment of strangers is incomplete. The men of the city demanded that Lot 
bring out the strangers he had harbored in his house that they "might know 
them." This involved more than a mere getting acquainted. Lot replies by 
offering his two daughters "which have not known man." Clearly the knowledge 
the men sought was of a carnal nature. 
</P>
<P>
To claim that Paul, in his writings, was any more tolerant of homosexuality is 
absurd. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips can rightly complain about legal inequities between homosexual and 
heterosexual relationships, but to use Scripture to morally justify a gay or 
lesbian lifestyle one must wear narrow blinders while reading.

Earlier, Brad Gilbert outlasted Aaron Krickstein in an error-filled match to 
win, 6-7 (7-5), 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
In today's semifinals, Gilbert will play Wheaton, and Pete Sampras will face 
Michael Chang. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest win of my career," Wheaton said. "I had a simple strategy 
and that was to hit as deep as I could and to try to keep him under pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton broke Lendl in the opening game to set the tone of the match. 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton scored another break for a 4-1 lead, dropped his serve in the next 
game, but broke again to lead, 5-2. Wheaton served out the set at love. 
</P>
<P>
There were no breaks in the second set, but Wheaton was down 15-40 in the 
fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
"He hit an ace with his second serve, then an unreturnable serve, then another 
ace. He served himself out of trouble," Lendl said. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl himself fought off two break points in the ninth game. 
</P>
<P>
Wheaton, seeded eighth, raced to a 3-0 lead in the tiebreak and had two match 
points. Lendl saved the first with an effective return to the corner, but his 
next return went long. 
</P>
<P>
"The court is fast and favors his game," Lendl said. "He took full advantage of 
it. I knew he can hit powerfully, but I was surprised how consistent he was. He 
deserves to be in the semifinal." 
</P>
<P>
By getting to the semifinals, Wheaton made sure of winning at least $450,000, 
nearly doubling his career earnings of $481,712. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, ranked 10th in the world, was also happy about the money. 
</P>
<P>
"This is about three times more money than I ever made in a week and I feel 
great about it," said Gilbert, who only came to the tournament as a replacement 
for injured Andre Agassi. "And I can still make more."

THERE AREN'T ENOUGH DRAVECKYS ANYMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sports pages are filled almost daily with stories of whining, 
multimillion-dollar-salaried baseball players, many of whom in another era 
would not have been worthy enough to put on the uniform of a major leaguer, let 
alone become one. 
</P>
<P>
About the time one is ready to sour on the game for good, there comes another 
chapter in the heart-wrenching saga of Dave Dravecky (Dec. 7). 
</P>
<P>
If we are to use attendance figures and those insane salaries as a barometer, 
the game has never been healthier. 
</P>
<P>
Reality is, however, that types like Hall of Fame human being Dave Dravecky are 
fast disappearing from the scene. With their departure, one is hard-pressed to 
come up with a valid reason to maintain a passion for what is no longer "the 
Grand Old Game."

It was such a pleasure to read Bill Plaschke's article on Dave Dravecky. 
</P>
<P>
I attended the Priority Living benefit dinner where Dave spoke. There were over 
300 people at the dinner who heard Dave emphasize in his talk the very issues 
that Mr. Plaschke communicates in his writing. 
</P>
<P>
Since your readers typically are operating with limited time for worthwhile 
stuff to read, I applaud your paper and Bill's talent for great journalism.

DON'T CREDIT VACHON FOR KINGS' SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is Allan Malamud so desperate for ideas and so out of touch with reality that 
he has to congratulate King General Manager Rogie Vachon on a new contract as 
well as credit him for the Kings' play this season? 
</P>
<P>
The move that fueled Malamud's misguided praise was Vachon's acquisition of 
goalie Daniel Berthiaume from Minnesota before this season. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Berthiaume's stellar play, it is conveniently forgotten that the 
player traded to the North Stars, Craig Duncanson, was the Kings' No. 1 draft 
choice in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Duncanson played in only 28 games for the Kings, scoring a measly three goals. 
Not the sort of production one would expect from a first-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
But the drafting of Duncanson and his subsequent play is not an isolated case. 
Vachon has been burned so many times in player transactions that he should wear 
gloves when he's dealing on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
Who can forget the 1986 acquisition of aging netminder Al Jensen for speedy 
defenseman Garry Galley (still playing, by the way)? How about slow Gilles 
Hamel for crafty Paul Fenton? Perhaps the "best" was obtaining lethargic Mikko 
Makela in 1989 for two players still contributing to the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Malamud, the only reason Vachon still has a job in the NHL is because Jerry 
Buss knew even less about hockey and because Bruce McNall needs a figurehead to 
carry out his wishes. Don't insult the intelligence of L.A. hockey fans by 
suggesting that Vachon is responsible for the Kings' success. The team has 
prospered not because of him, but in spite of him.

The massacre by the Lakers of the Detroit Pistons was exactly what the Lakers 
needed to build the confidence to regain the NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
But why risk injury to Magic Johnson by putting him back in the game with eight 
minutes left and a 23-point lead? Please, Mike Dunleavy, how about giving the 
other Lakers a chance to gain valuable experience that will be needed come the 
playoffs, and rest the Magic Man? We need him for the next 11 years (well, 
that's my Christmas wish).

LOST 'GENERATIONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the articles about the plight of blacks in the entertainment 
industry: I am a black woman who was happily employed as a writer on 
"Generations" until its recent cancellation. I had the opportunity to work on a 
show that not only portrayed blacks in a positive manner, interacting with 
whites and dealing with problems that are universal in them, but also provided 
jobs, both behind and in front of the camera, for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
You would think organizations such as the NAACP would applaud and support an 
endeavor such as ours. You would be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
An appeal was made to the NAACP to help save the show. There was a press 
announcement regarding a national letter-writing campaign spearheaded by that 
organization. We waited for the letters to inundate NBC executives. We're still 
waiting. 
</P>
<P>
"Generations" could have used the support. That might have made the difference. 
Instead, we hear of more panels, more symposiums, bemoaning the plight of 
blacks in the industry. My question is: Were they so shortsighted and so busy 
being angry that they didn't notice that a show already existed that addressed 
many of their concerns? 
</P>
<P>
Now, because we work at the mercy of something called the Nielsens, 
"Generations" has been canceled. And I seriously doubt whether anything this 
progressive will ever be seen again because the powers-that-be can shrug their 
shoulders and say, "America isn't interested in seeing black people portrayed 
simply as human beings. America doesn't want to see a fully integrated show. We 
tried it. It didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
As a black woman, I am appalled.

TAKING SIDES OVER ABORTION AND TBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TBS is taking sides with teen-agers who find it impossible to obey some of the 
restrictive parental notification laws that have been passed in many states. 
Broadcasting "Abortion Denied: Shattering Young Women's Lives" does not say 
that TBS is pro-abortion. 
</P>
<P>
It does say that it is pro-choice -- a distinction in terms that is important 
and frequently not observed by the media. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner did the public a favor by giving it facts about a situation many of 
us are ignorant of. Those of us who come from middle-class homes and would 
support our children and help them come to the conclusion that is right for 
them are often unaware of homes where parents are unavailable or would abuse a 
daughter who told them she was pregnant. Some of these pregnancies are the 
result of rape, incest or just ignorance. Compassionate counseling and 
assistance are what is needed, not punitive laws.

Bravo! I salute Howard Rosenberg's column in speaking up for equal time for the 
other side of a controversy that is dividing the nation. I am myself pro-choice 
on the abortion issue, but as someone concerned with media and with the future 
of civilized dialogue in this country I feel the defense of balance and of 
respect for difference is vital for our democratic future. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, I have felt that he has only spoken up for balance when he felt 
that points of view on the liberal-left side of the divide did not get an 
airing. This column would seem to indicate that I did him an injustice. Please 
take this as my apology.

THE STRUGGLE AND TRIUMPH OF 'A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST' ON CHANNEL 28 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PBS' "Wonderworks Family Movie" scores high marks for "A Girl of the 
Limberlost," airing Sunday at 5 p.m. on KCET Channel 28. 
</P>
<P>
Based on part of Gene Stratton Porter's novel, set in 1908 rural Indiana, it's 
the story of a gifted 15-year-old who struggles against poverty, the scorn of 
her peers and her widowed mother's bitterness, to find her own future. 
</P>
<P>
As Elnora Comstock, Heather Fairfield is a believable mixture of vulnerability 
and unquenchable stubbornness, with a memorable smile in her moments of 
triumph. 
</P>
<P>
Joanna Cassidy ("Who Framed Roger Rabbit," "Under Fire"), as the soignee 
naturalist who inspires Elnora, doesn't have much to do except provide a 
sympathetic presence. But Annette O'Toole is a surprise as mother Kate. Most 
recently seen in the Stephen King TV thriller "It," O'Toole eschews all glamour 
here. Her Kate is stocky, hard-faced and weathered, sullen over the fate that 
left her to a life of endless toil. 
</P>
<P>
Under the resentment is pain and love, and O'Toole shows it through the 
gruffness, but not too often, and not too soon. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Douglas' screenplay is predictable, filled with a climactic storm, a 
ruined crop, an adorable orphan, a villainous tax collector and helpful 
mentors. But the heroine's consuming quest for knowledge is a refreshing theme, 
and Burt Brinckerhoff's thoughtful direction and solid principal cast make 
enjoyable watching. LYNNE HEFFLEY

'BLOODY POETRY' FROM BRENTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rebels, given enough time, can look ridiculous even to their most natural 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
Poets Percy Bysshe Shelley and George Byron, the top artistic anarchists of 
their day, would seem to have a perfect dramatic biographer in Howard Brenton, 
who remains Britain's toughest radical playwright. Yet there is always a part 
of Brenton that doubts his own beliefs, and it's that side of his brain that 
makes "Bloody Poetry" interesting. 
</P>
<P>
It is far from Brenton at his best, and a curious choice for London City 
Theatre to bring to the Beverly Hills Playhouse. But, at its sharpest, "Bloody 
Poetry" does make Shelley and Byron seem a little ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
This also rescues Roxana Silbert's production (dressed in designer Annie 
Kelly's alternating black-and-white, floor-to-ceiling drapes that fail to 
coordinate with the uncredited costumes) from the hell of museum theater. Many 
tableaux -- the poets in studied, romantic poses, their women in consternated 
profiles -- come close to parodying the notion of young, rich rads on the 
continent, yet not close enough to suggest that parody is in mind. Clues to the 
deconstruction of the Romantics lie elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Kingsbury's Shelley and Nigel Miles-Thomas' Byron are wonderfully -- 
and dangerously -- childlike, yet perfect opposites of each other. The blond, 
unblemished Kingsbury stresses Shelley's pre-adult nature, youth on the cusp of 
a maturity never to come. Miles-Thomas' ruddy face framed by long sideburns is 
matched by his finely-tuned vocal engine, which makes Byron's ragings all the 
more propulsive: He is the adult stuck in gear, never quite able to get over 
the clap. 
</P>
<P>
The poets don't stick to their roles, though: child Percy is in a "three-way 
marriage" with Mary, author of "Frankenstein" (Lise Bruno) and Claire 
Clairemont (Xanthe Gresham), while adult George resists all commitments. 
</P>
<P>
The trio, of course, cannot last, despite Shelley's calls for "a new society." 
Here again -- and this is Brenton's problem -- we laugh at the utopian 
flapdoodle while also wondering how a playwright can think his character can 
talk like this. If this is comedy, it's through very muddy water. 
</P>
<P>
The poets' hanger-on and would-be biographer, Polidori (Anthony Wise), reminds 
us that these were the rock stars of their time, even while he's trying to cash 
in on their fame. Wise, more than most of the cast, lets every word drip with 
its sarcastic possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
The play seems unfinished, perhaps due to Brenton's skeptical relationship to 
foolish renegades. His distance from them, out of fear of identifying too 
closely with emotionally stunted but great writers, gives "Bloody Poetry" a 
paradoxical bloodlessness -- which follows from a work wrapped in paradox. 
</P>
<P>
"Bloody Poetry," Beverly Hills Playhouse, 254 S. Robertson Blvd., 
Friday-Sunday, 8 p.m.; matinee Saturday, 4 p.m. Ends Sunday. $12; (213)

SACRAMENTO FILE: MEASURE WOULD REQUIRE PUBLIC COMMENT BEFORE A BOARD VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jerry Gillam, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under legislation introduced in the state Senate, city councils and county 
boards of supervisors would be required to give the public a chance to comment 
on agenda items before official consideration or a vote can be taken. 
</P>
<P>
Although state law presently requires an opportunity for public comment, it 
does not specify whether it should come before, during or after a public body 
considers an item. 
</P>
<P>
"Several of my constituents have expressed outrage that some public bodies take 
comment only after voting on an item," said Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), the 
author of the measure (SB 100). "This bill makes it clear that such comment 
must come before consideration of an item." 
</P>
<P>
Lockyer's legislation was prompted by a recent decision of an advisory 
committee of the East Bay Regional Park District to use pregnant deer for an 
experiment on Lyme disease. The committee allowed public comment only after it 
had voted on the proposal, the Northern California lawmaker said.

<P>
Deane C. Davis, 90, the former Vermont governor who pushed through legislation 
to protect the state's environment. 
</P>
<P>
A two-term Republican, Davis in 1970 had one of the most successful legislative 
sessions ever enjoyed by a Vermont governor. Legislators enacted a pioneering 
law that controlled major development projects by establishing how they would 
be evaluated; an innovative water quality law, and legislation restructuring 
the government into super-agencies. In April of that year, Davis presided over 
Vermont's first Green-up Day, a project to clean up the state. More than 70,000 
people helped remove 4,000 truckloads of trash from interstate highways. On

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RAIDERS FAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN ATTACK AT 
GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles Raiders fan pleaded not guilty Friday to beating up a Pittsburgh 
Steelers fan during a game between the two football teams at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Shane Geringer, 19, of Agoura Hills was arraigned before Superior Court Judge 
Gary Klausner on felony charges of assault with a deadly weapon and battery 
causing serious bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
The judge set a pretrial hearing for Dec. 18. 
</P>
<P>
At a preliminary hearing, Mark Zanelli, a fan who was at the Sept. 23 game, 
testified that Geringer knocked Paul Albrecht, 35, of Tucson, Ariz., to the 
ground then "knelt down and hit (him) three more times." 
</P>
<P>
Albrecht briefly lapsed into a coma, suffered a broken jaw and was hospitalized 
for more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
Geringer's lawyer, Leslie Abramson, has described him as a "fanatic Raiders 
fan" who has a drinking problem. 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum Commission banned alcohol from the subsequent Raiders game, and on 
Nov. 7 it voted to restrict future sales.

WRIGHT 'PERPLEXED' OVER GRAND JURY'S INTEREST IN HER 1985 DUMP SITES BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) says she is perplexed about why a 
federal grand jury subpoenaed records on a 1985 bill she introduced to allow 
state waste officials to override local opposition to new dump sites. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea why they would pick that bill," Wright said. "All I can 
remember is that we dropped it. What was the big deal?" 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which died in committee, was among at least seven bills subpoenaed 
Dec. 7 by federal authorities, apparently in connection with an investigation 
of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and his relationship with 
one of his private legal clients, Norcal Solid Waste Systems Inc., a San 
Francisco-based garbage disposal company. 
</P>
<P>
One source familiar with the case indicated that Wright is not a target of the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview this week, Wright said Brown never discussed the legislation 
with her. "I was unaware that he was involved with trash in any way," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, whose district includes areas of the West Valley, recalled that the 
measure was introduced on behalf of the California Waste Management Board. 
</P>
<P>
According to an Assembly Natural Resources Committee analysis of the proposal, 
the board urged passage of the measure because "the state is running out of 
disposal capacity, yet new facilities are not being established because of 
local public opposition to siting such facilities." 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, state waste officials would have had authority to override 
local opposition if denial of a dump posed a threat to public health, safety or 
well-being. Wright said the bill hit a snag when various parties -- including 
local governments -- could not agree on what would constitute a public health 
emergency. Without consensus, Wright said, she dropped the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's supporters included the city of San Francisco and the California 
Refuse Removal Council. Albert Marino, a lobbyist for the council, acknowledged 
that he has been questioned by the grand jury about Norcal but said he does not 
recall being questioned about the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked me if I had ever asked Willie Brown's office" for assistance on any 
legislation or whether Norcal officials urged him to obtain "Willie Brown's 
intercession." Marino said he had not sought Brown's help on Norcal's behalf or 
been asked by Norcal to talk to the Speaker in connection with any bills. 
</P>
<P>
According to reports filed with the secretary of state, Norcal is a major 
campaign donor, which in the past two years has contributed nearly $125,000, 
including $500 to Wright. Norcal has only one Southern California subsidiary, 
which operates four dumps for San Bernardino County, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright's bill was opposed by the County Supervisors Assn. of California and the 
California League of Cities, which voiced concerns that the proposal could 
usurp local dump siting authority. 
</P>
<P>
Robert F. Conheim, general counsel to the waste board, said the Wright measure 
was handled routinely. "It didn't seem to have any hidden agendas," Conheim 
said.

BEILENSON SAYS IRAQ FOES WELCOME MILITARY THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following meetings with Saudi Arabian, Israeli and Egyptian officials in the 
Middle East, Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) said Friday that Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein's neighbors agree that neither economic sanctions nor 
negotiations will persuade him to withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"They feel strongly that the only thing that will have any effect is a 
creditable military threat," Beilenson said by phone from Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson, chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, is 
the co-leader of a 19-member congressional delegation that met with U.S. 
military commanders and troops in the Saudi desert for two days before flying 
to Israel Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
The group was scheduled to return to Washington today. It also includes Rep. 
Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley). 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson said he was deeply impressed by the American troops, particularly 
Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces, and other senior officers. 
He said morale was generally high and became higher the closer lawmakers got to 
the front lines. 
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, you almost hope they have an opportunity to prove 
themselves," Beilenson said of the young soldiers. "On the other hand, having 
met them personally, you come away feeling so strongly you don't want to lose 
one single one of them." 
</P>
<P>
In Israel, the legislators met with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens and 
Foreign Minister David Levy.

BOND MEASURE OKD FOR BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The financially strapped Los Angeles Community College District has decided to 
ask voters to approve a $200-million bond issue in an April 9 election. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is part of an effort to improve facilities at all nine district 
schools, including Pierce College in Woodland Hills, Valley College in Van Nuys 
and Mission College in San Fernando and Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
"We've arrived at possibly the biggest vote this board will make," Trustee 
Lindsay Conner said. "If it passes it will be the biggest injection of funds I 
have seen in my 10 years on the board." 
</P>
<P>
The board has also decided to spend $400,000 to get the measure, which will 
need a two-thirds majority to pass, on the ballot. The bond money can only be 
used to improve or buy land and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"This could conceivably complete all of our campuses," said Hal Garvin, citing 
the backlog of uncompleted building projects at the district's campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The district faces an $8-million deficit and has cut several hundred classes 
districtwide. 
</P>
<P>
If the bond measure passes, the district will impose a property tax on county 
voters to repay the debt. 
</P>
<P>
Local governments, schools and community college districts are permitted, under 
the California Constitution, to raise property taxes above the 1% limit imposed 
by Proposition 13 in order to pay off general obligation bonds. DAN DOW

Students at Antelope Valley College now have the opportunity to walk some real 
halls of ivy, thanks to a new program that includes a semester of study in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley is the 11th community college to join the ranks of the Southern 
California Foothills Consortium, which sends faculty and students abroad to 
study. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other foreign study programs, the consortium sends its own faculty 
abroad to teach the students. 
</P>
<P>
"These are American community college students attending American community 
college courses taught by American community college professors in London," 
said Rae Yoshida, vice president of academic affairs, who represents the 
college on the consortium. 
</P>
<P>
The consortium contracts for academic and support services that include 
classroom facilities, meals, housing, counseling and special cultural and 
social events. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, students are given memberships in the University of London and 
the Imperial College's student union. 
</P>
<P>
To be considered for the program, students must have completed 12 units of 
college with a 2.5 grade-point average by the time they begin the London 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Once in London, they are required to enroll in a minimum of 12 units, including 
three units of British life and culture. 
</P>
<P>
The $4,000 cost of the program includes tuition, air fare, accommodations, 
meals and trips. Consortium officials said financial aid is available. 
</P>
<P>
Other colleges that belong to the consortium include Citrus College, College of 
the Canyons, Pasadena City College and Victor Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1992 the consortium plans to offer a semester in Guadalajara, 
with an emphasis on language. Then, there are plans to add Florence, Italy, and 
Madrid as destinations, Yoshida said. STEVE DELANEY

THOUSAND OAKS TOURNAMENT;

LANCERS LAY CLAIM TO OWN TOURNAMENT FOR 1ST TIME

When the Thousand Oaks High basketball team's run-and-gun machine sputtered 
Friday night in the championship game of the Thousand Oaks tournament, the 
Lancers found an unlikely spark plug. 
</P>
<P>
Shane Graham, a 6-foot-6, 220-pound junior center, came off the bench in the 
second half to score 12 of his 14 points in leading Thousand Oaks to an 84-80 
victory over Nogales and its first championship in the 19-year history of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks (3-0) had scored 193 points in the first two games of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We struggled tonight," Thousand Oaks Coach Ed Chevalier said. "Graham came in 
and got some crucial rebounds and made some real key free throws." 
</P>
<P>
Graham hit a short jump shot at the end of the third quarter to break a 61-61 
tie and scored five of Thousand Oaks' first eight points in the fourth period. 
He also hit a free throw to give the Lancers a 75-65 advantage with 2 minutes 6 
seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed some easy shots early in the game and wanted to redeem myself," 
Graham said. "I was real tired and wanted to come out, but we were determined 
to win the championship for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks' Chris Loll, a senior forward who was playing on a severely 
sprained ankle, scored a game-high 26 points and had 84 in the three games. 
Loll was selected the tournament's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks led, 79-77, with 51 seconds to play. Loll converted four free 
throws down the stretch to help put the game out of reach with seven seconds to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Nogales (5-2) trailed, 76-69, with 1:06 left, but Carne Wilson scored eight 
points within 47 seconds on two three-point baskets and a pair of free throws 
to cut the deficit to 81-77 with 19 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Borg scored 17 points and Graham and Dusty Lysobey each had eight 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Nogales is a good team," Chevalier said. "They're quick and made us work for 
our victory. I'm proud of our effort. It was a real good test for us." 
</P>
<P>
In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Agoura 84, Alemany 68 -- Sean Martin poured in 31 points, including 17 in the 
first half, and Richard Corridori had 24 to lead Agoura in the third-place 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, a 6-foot guard who scored 49 points in a loss to Nogales in the 
semifinals, has scored 146 points in his past four games. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura (3-2) led by as many as 22 in the third quarter, but Alemany (4-3) 
closed to within 14 midway through the fourth period. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Dice and Will Burr had 26 and 20 points for Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park 92, Hueneme 72 -- Tim Lane scored 23 points and Robert Fick added 
19 to lead Newbury Park (2-4) in the seventh-place game. Tony Smith paced 
Hueneme (3-6) with 23 points and Wendell Nunnery had 18. 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas 67, Oxnard 47 -- Calabasas (3-4) led, 22-3, after one quarter in the 
consolation final.

CHEVALIER IGNITES CSUN, 83-73 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It looked like another game was about to unravel for Cal State Northridge on 
Friday night. Freshman point guard Andre Chevalier was tripped and stripped of 
the ball and San Diego scored on the break at the other end to take its biggest 
lead of the game. 
</P>
<P>
But Chevalier went coast-to-coast on the next CSUN possession, igniting a 
second-half run that gave the Matadors their second victory this season, an 
83-73 win over the Toreros. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (2-6) is undefeated at Matador Gymnasium. San Diego, of the West 
Coast Conference, lost its third in a row to fall to 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
"As you know, I get knocked down all the time so I don't know if that gave me 
incentive as much as the turnover," Chevalier said. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I make a turnover I try to get the ball back and make up for my 
mistake instead of putting my head down like I used to do. I used to get mad 
instead of keeping on playing. That's one thing coach (Pete Cassidy) taught 
me." 
</P>
<P>
After his driving layup, Chevalier twice attacked the same place on the court, 
taking Kyle Kerlegan's man with him each time before wheeling to feed Kerlegan, 
who sank consecutive three-point shots. From there, CSUN outscored San Diego, 
21-6, to take a 15-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
"It is all due to Andre's quickness," said Kerlegan, who finished with a 
team-high 18 points -- 14 in the second half -- on 50% shooting. "My man had to 
leave me. All I had to do was hit an open shot. The first three I hit I was 
really, really open. That gave me my confidence back because I didn't shoot 
well in the first half." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego gave the Matadors a scare when it cut the lead to five on Michael 
Brown's three-point basket with 3 minutes 45 seconds left, but on the ensuing 
possession, CSUN ended a three-minute scoring drought with a basket by Todd 
Bowser after a no-look pass from Keith Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
Then Chevalier came up with a steal on the Toreros' ensuing possession to stem 
San Diego's momentum. Gibbs was fouled and hit one of the shots, and the 
Toreros missed on their next four possessions, including a jump hook shot by 
6-9 center Dondi Bell that was blocked from the side by CSUN's David Swanson, a 
7-foot high jumper. 
</P>
<P>
With 1:33 left, Chevalier escaped the San Diego press and lofted a lob to 
Gibbs, who put it down for a 77-67 advantage. In the final 1:16, CSUN hit all 
four of its foul shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Matadors shot a season-high 50% from the field, including seven of 14 from 
three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Chevalier scored a season-high 16 points and had five assists. Gibbs scored 12 
and Kirk Scott scored a season-high 11. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Bowser grabbed a season-high 12 rebounds and Shelton Boykin had nine. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best effort we've had all year," Cassidy said. "It is an excellent 
Christmas present for the Northridge players. We've been humiliated on the 
road. . . . I've lost 10 pounds and I can't sleep at night." 
</P>
<P>
Toreros Coach Hank Egan probably won't catch any Zs either after watching his 
team shoot a season-low 39%, including a two-of-23 effort from three-point 
range. 
</P>
<P>
Egan criticized the San Diego media for putting undue pressure on his players 
by saying that they would win easily. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a hole in my gut all week," Egan said, "and that's as disappointed as 
I've ever been." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge played horrendously at the outset, but for once it didn't matter -- 
San Diego was just as awful. The Matadors missed 11 of their first 15 shots 
while the Toreros missed on 10 of their first 15 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams finally found the mark with 11 minutes left in the first half. Scott 
sank three consecutive shots for CSUN, including one for three points, only his 
third on 12 attempts this season, and the 6-foot-9, 240-pound Bell started to 
heat up.

MATADOR NOTES: Cassidy and his players paid homage to the home-court advantage: 
"Our guys are so excited not to sleep in a Holiday Inn tonight," Cassidy said, 
"Nothing against Holiday Inn.". . . David Keeter, who is averaging 10 points a 
game, missed his second consecutive game because of a sprained ankle. . . . 
CSUN center Percy Fisher, who is academically ineligible this semester, calmed 
the Matamaniacs (a group of football and basketball players who paint their 
faces and chests) after a referee gave one of them a warning. . . .

IN A BIG TWIST, POLY TURNS TO ITS PASSING AND DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Who would have guessed? 
</P>
<P>
All season long, Poly High had relied on its bone-jarring rushing attack to 
succeed, yet when push came to shove in Friday night's City Section 3-A 
Division championship game against Lincoln at East Los Angeles College, it was 
the Parrots' passing game and defense that made the critical plays in a 28-8 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, Jonathan Campbell rushed for 182 yards in 31 carries. And sure, Poly 
amassed 273 rushing yards and 386 yards in offense. 
</P>
<P>
But big pass plays and big defensive plays -- by wide receiver-defensive back 
Mike Vreeland and tight end-linebacker Gerardo Munoz in particular -- proved 
decisive in the Parrots' first true City football title. 
</P>
<P>
Poly (11-3) had won five previous titles -- the most recent in 1928 -- before 
the implementation of a playoff format in 1934. Before that, the champion was 
either the City League titlist or was determined by a consensus vote of City 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Poly, the East Valley League runner-up to Sylmar, established dominance on the 
offensive line on its first drive, marching 75 yards in 14 plays for a 7-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen of Poly's plays were runs, except for Vreeland's 15-yard reception of 
a Lance Garcia pass on a third-and-nine play from the Lincoln 18-yard line. 
Garcia, who completed four of four passes for 113 yards, scored on a two-yard 
run two plays later. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw it open all night," Vreeland, a junior, said of the pass play. "We were 
just waiting for (Coach Fred Cuccia) to give us the call and he did. It was 
man-to-man coverage and we knew we could take them man to man." 
</P>
<P>
After Lincoln (9-4-1) had taken an 8-7 lead on a 21-yard touchdown pass from 
quarterback Gaspar Ortega to his brother Marcelo, a wide receiver, Munoz got 
into the act. 
</P>
<P>
On Poly's ensuing possession, the Parrots were faced with a third and 11 from 
their own 28. Garcia and Munoz then hooked up for a 40-yard pass that gave the 
Parrots a first and 10 at the Lincoln 32. A personal foul on the Tigers moved 
the ball to the 17. Five plays later, Campbell scored on a three-yard run that 
gave Poly a 13-8 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After punts by each team, Lincoln drove to the Poly 26, but Vreeland 
intercepted an Ortega pass at the 15 and returned it to the Parrots' 40. 
</P>
<P>
"I just happened to be in the right spot," Vreeland said of his first 
interception of the season. "The ball was there and I took it back the best I 
could." 
</P>
<P>
Poly then marched 60 yards in eight plays -- capped by Garcia's two-yard run -- 
to take a 19-8 lead with 32 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the plays were runs, but Garcia's 44-yard hookup with Vreeland on a 
third and 10 from the Poly 40 keyed the drive. 
</P>
<P>
With Poly leading, 22-8, late in the third quarter, Lincoln drove to the 
Parrots' 39-yard line, but defensive lineman Pedro Medina recovered Fernie 
Delgadillo's fumble, and Poly reeled off a 13-play, 61-yard march. 
</P>
<P>
On Lincoln's next series, the Tigers marched to the Poly one but couldn't 
score. 
</P>
<P>
On a third and goal from the one, Poly defensive back Danny Martinez knocked 
down an Ortega pass in the left corner of the end zone. After an 
illegal-procedure penalty on Lincoln, Munoz deflected a pass intended for 
Marcelo Ortega in the right corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach told me I had to cover my man," Munoz said, "and I just followed him and 
did the best I could."

CANYONS TOPPLES GLENDALE, ADVANCES TO TITLE GAME

<P>
Glendale College, which has been making a habit of winning its own tournament, 
will be watching rather than participating during tonight's final, thanks to 
the College of the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars, despite a rash of turnovers, led throughout and won easily to 
eliminate the defending champions, 83-75, Friday night in the semifinal game of 
the Vaquero tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (6-6) had won the tournament three of the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons (6-5), which will play L. A. City for the championship tonight at 7, 
survived 29 turnovers and got a monster game from center Reggie Bell, who 
scored 19 points and had 18 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Four Cougar players scored 12 points each -- Nick Sanderson, David Langley, 
Jeff Dorst and Marquis Wilborn. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale was led by sophomore forward Kelly Crosby, who scored 17 points before 
fouling out with 2 minutes 21 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Enoch Mack added 15 points for Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale fell behind, 9-0, to start the game, rallied behind the shooting of 
Crosby, who scored nine of the Vaqueros' first 14 points and had 13 points in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Canyons spread the points around in the first half (four players had eight 
points at halftime) and led the entire way, settling for a 43-38 advantage at 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
In another game: 
</P>
<P>
El Camino 72, Valley 62 -- Valley led by six points with five minutes to play, 
but then collapsed down the stretch and was eliminated from the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino (11-5), getting eight points from forward Keishaun Darthard, went on 
a 14-0 run and took a commanding 68-60 lead with less than two minutes to play. 
Darthard led all scorers with 26 points, including 10 in the last five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Center Art Kirksey scored Valley's only basket in the final five minutes. 
Valley Coach Jim Stephens took part of the blame for his team's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a mistake. I put a couple of players in the game, but they couldn't get 
open for their shots," Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
"El Camino is a veteran team. They just took us out of our game. They knew 
where we were going." 
</P>
<P>
Valley (7-5) trailed by as many as nine points in the first half but outscored 
El Camino, 12-3, in the final four minutes to tie the score, 35-35, at 
intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore guard Rick Garrick led Valley's second-half charge, scoring 13 of his 
team-leading 22 points on an assortment of twisting drives and outside jump 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Garrick didn't get much help. Guard Tory Stephens, who had 10 points at 
halftime, missed all eight of his second-half shots. 
</P>
<P>
Valley converted just 27% of its field-goal attempts in the second half.

<P>
The Moorpark College men's basketball team bounced back from its second loss of 
the season to handle Pasadena City, 102-92, Friday night and finish third in 
the Crown City Classic at Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
After a dismal second half in a Thursday night loss to Rancho Santiago, 
Moorpark rebounded with a 57-point, second-half explosion against Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's Sam Crawford accounted for more than two-thirds of his team's total 
with 33 points and 18 assists. Crawford, who broke the Moorpark career assist 
record two games ago, now has 609. 
</P>
<P>
All five Moorpark starters scored in double figures. Shooting guard Damian 
Wilson scored 24. Forwards Jimmy Galbert and Mike Waggoner each scored 10, and 
center Aaron Smith added 13. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark is 13-2, and Pasadena is 8-8.

THE CREATOR OF DBASESOFTWARE MAINTAINS THAT IT IS ORIGINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
C. Wayne Ratliff 13 years ago simply wanted to write a personal computer 
software program that would help him win the office football pool. Instead, the 
then-young computer programmer came up with one of the best-selling software 
programs of all time -- but now also the center of a brewing industry 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
By day back then, Ratliff and his colleagues at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
in Pasadena kept track of the comings and goings of the solar system for NASA's 
unmanned space program on a huge Univac mainframe computer. 
</P>
<P>
By night, in the cluttered den of his Tujunga home, Ratliff tried to turn the 
same principles that tracked, sorted and assessed information on the stars and 
planets into a PC program that would analyze National Football League 
statistics and spit out the likely winners of each week's matchups. 
</P>
<P>
By 1978, Ratliff had written such a program. Called Vulcan, after the home 
planet of "Star Trek's" Mr. Spock, the software was built around a set of 58 
computer commands -- 33 of which Ratliff said he "borrowed" from the JPL 
software. It could sort, edit, display, copy and count vast amounts of data -- 
more information than had ever been tracked on a personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
Ratliff tried to make a business success of his work, but it took two 
aggressive Los Angeles marketing men to exploit its full potential. George Tate 
and Hal Lashlee renamed the program dBase, because it sounded "techno-trendy," 
and built an entire company -- Ashton-Tate -- to bring it to the masses. 
</P>
<P>
The plan worked. Virtually overnight, dBase made Torrance-based Ashton-Tate 
what it remains today: the nation's fourth-largest software publisher. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ashton-Tate's continued success, and the status of its star product, 
were thrown into jeopardy Thursday when a federal judge stripped the company of 
its copyright protection for dBase. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter in Los Angeles ruled that the company had 
repeatedly failed to disclose, on a series of copyright applications filed with 
the federal government from 1984 through mid-1990, that Ratliff's program was 
derived from the JPL program. The judge said the company's actions were 
undertaken "knowingly and with an intent to deceive." 
</P>
<P>
If the ruling is upheld, it would be a serious blow to Ashton-Tate because it 
would give rivals a legal basis to freely produce dBase clones. 
</P>
<P>
Ashton-Tate executives, who say they have nothing to hide, have vowed to fight 
the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Ashton-Tate's current senior executives, none with the company when the first 
copyright application was filed in 1984, said Friday that while the company has 
repeatedly acknowledged the connection between Ratliff and JPL, it does not 
consider dBase to be a derivation of the laboratory's software. 
</P>
<P>
"DBase is an original work inspired by the ideas in the JPL program," said 
William P. Lyons, Ashton-Tate's chief executive. "We weren't trying to hide 
anything. Everyone in the entire industry knew where Wayne had worked and 
gotten some ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Lyons said the only reason the connection was not disclosed in the copyright 
filings is that the lawyer completing the first application was unaware of it. 
Subsequent filings, he said, were copied from the first. 
</P>
<P>
Ratliff, now 44 and a computer consultant living in San Luis Obispo, said 
Friday that he is angry that his work and its derivation and inspiration have 
been called into question. 
</P>
<P>
"The JPL program is the model I used. I have always acknowledged that, and so 
has the company," said Ratliff. "I borrowed here and there . . . I didn't copy 
it . . . I added something to it." 
</P>
<P>
The birth of a computer program may be a marvelous thing, but tracing its 
lineage is often complicated and murky. A software writer can contend that he 
has been "inspired" by the work of another, but others might judge it outright 
mimicry, or even copying. 
</P>
<P>
How do software writers tell the difference? With some difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not exactly a bright line between what is or is not a derivative 
work," said Stuart Lubitz, a Los Angeles attorney specializing in intellectual 
property. 
</P>
<P>
Ratliff agreed. "My mother always said that there was nothing new under the 
sun, and she was right. I challenge anyone to find work without elements of 
stuff that has preceded it." 
</P>
<P>
Ratliff said that while 33 of the 58 commands in the original program were 
taken from the JPL program, the two sets of software bear little additional 
resemblance. 
</P>
<P>
The JPL program, he said, was written in the Fortran computer language, while 
his was written in Assembly, and later translated into the "C" computer 
language.

RAIDERS STILL HAVE A HOME IN IRWINDALE; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: THE CITY CONTINUES TO LEASE THE FRANCHISE AN OFFICE FOR $1 A 
YEAR, DESPITE THE TEAM'S DECISION TO STAY IN LOS ANGELES. MAYOR SAYS 'ENOUGH IS 
ENOUGH' TO ARRANGEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A year has passed since Irwindale's dreams of luring the Raiders faded, but the 
tiny San Gabriel Valley city still has not punted the pro football franchise 
from town. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having lost more than $10 million, Irwindale continues to lease an 
office to the team for a meager $1 a year -- a hangover from the early, heady 
days of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
And although it has been several months since team owner Al Davis announced he 
would stay in Los Angeles, the office remains stocked with $30,000 in 
silver-and-black furniture purchased by Irwindale officials when the team 
seemed destined for a gravel pit north of the Foothill Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"Our attorneys told their attorneys to let us know if they wanted us out," said 
Raiders senior executive John Herrera, the last of what was once a seven-person 
staff in Irwindale. "Obviously, we would oblige. But they've never responded, 
so we're still here." 
</P>
<P>
Irwindale Mayor Richard Chico said he was aware that the Raiders still had a 
local outpost and admitted that maintaining the cushy terms of the lease was 
probably an oversight by the city. 
</P>
<P>
"That's embarrassing," Chico said. "Enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-square-foot office is in a wing of the complex the Chamber of 
Commerce shares with senior citizens. It sells tickets, supplies schedules and 
does other public relations work for the team. The office is still decorated 
with such collector's items as a mock street sign signaling the intersection of 
"Raiders Way" and "Irwindale Place." 
</P>
<P>
Such was the mood in 1987 when the city handed Davis a $10-million check as 
part of the effort to bring his team east. Irwindale officials threw a bash at 
the Rapscallion Seafood House and Bar, complete with cheerleaders. "Irwindale 
Raiders" T-shirts sold by the dozens. Rumors spread that the city's 1,100

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHRISTMAS LIGHTS STRUNG ON CYPRESS NEAR 
MENORAH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beverly Hills officials have strung colored lights on a Montezuma cypress to 
comply with a judge's order that they either take down a Hanukkah menorah in a 
city park or have it displayed next to a Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
"It certainly looks like an excellent solution to us," said Rick Putnam, 
director of public services. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-foot-high tree is about 50 feet from the menorah, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Doug Mirell, president of the Pacific Southwest chapter of the American 
Jewish Congress, which filed the suit that led to the ruling by U.S. District 
Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr., said the city's action may not satisfy the judge's 
requirement that the two objects be in "close proximity." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to avoid going back to court, but we'll look at this carefully," said 
Mirell, whose organization sued the city on the grounds that the 28-foot 
menorah across Santa Monica Boulevard from City Hall and the Beverly Hills Post 
Office violated the First Amendment ban on establishment of religion.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MEASURE ON REPLACING COUNCIL MEMBERS 
DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed amendment to the City Charter that would grant the Los Angeles City 
Council broader authority to remove its members from office is not likely to go 
before voters as a ballot measure until next June, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
It had been hoped by some City Hall officials that the amendment, which must be 
approved by voters, could be ready in time to appear on the April 9, 1991, 
ballot, allowing for a June special election to replace ailing Councilman 
Gilbert Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council's Rule and Election Committee, which has for the last week 
been pouring over the language of the amendment, seemed to agree that rushing 
the debate on the controversial issue could prove unwise. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lived with the situation we've got . . . for several months now; another 
couple of months isn't going to make a difference," committee Chairwoman Ruth 
Galanter said.

ONLY IN L.A.

<P>
L.A. is out of manhole covers. No, they weren't stolen again, only renamed. 
</P>
<P>
They're now maintenance hole covers -- by executive order of Mayor Tom Bradley. 
His Honor issued a directive Friday that banned the use of "sexist words" in 
all official reports. Bradley also decreed that people or humanity must be 
substituted for "mankind" (or, we presume, "dudes") and staffed should be used 
instead of "manned," and husband and wife instead of "man and wife." 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, Sacramento recently held a contest to rename manholes and also 
came up with maintenance holes. We think L.A. could have made a more dynamic 
choice, perhaps a rhyme that would emphasize the city's artsy side -- 
sewer-viewer, for example -- or an expression that spoke of its cosmopolitan 
nature, perhaps, le hole. 
</P>
<P>
But we'll leave the final judgment up to history, or herstory. 
</P>
<P>
Living in Brentwood isn't as easy as you might think. One gripe of residents in 
that posh community is that their mail is often delivered to the city of 
Brentwood in Contra Costa County, 350 miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten letters for Sylvester Stallone, Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson, 
Betty White, George Carlin, Marcus Allen, James Garner, Harrison Ford and 
Madonna," said Laura de Concepcion, a postal official there. 
</P>
<P>
Usually the problem is that the sender has confused Brentwood North's Zip code 
(95413) for Brentwood South's (90049), or just assumed that any letter 
addressed to Brentwood will be delivered to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Concepcion said that her Brentwood even received a mis-addressed letter "for 
President Reagan, because he has a ranch down there somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Brentwood -- where the buffalo roam. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration Building at Banning High is painted a shade of 
not-so-exciting "L.A. city school yellow," in the words of art teacher Barbara 
Kneafsey. So, to spruce it up a bit, she enlisted the aid of Joseph Acuna, 
Daetrice Stallworth, Sandra Perez and several other students at the Wilmington 
school. Drawing on Mayan and Aztec cultures, they created some directional 
signs for the building that entertain as well as direct. 
</P>
<P>
Stanley Asada of Monterey Park calls it a happy coincidence that press liaisons 
for local fire departments wear hats that say "PIO." Not only is it an acronym 
for "Press Information Officer," but pio means " 'to extinguish' (as one does 
with fire) in Hawaiian. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Weitzman points out in California magazine that there are a few 
differences between our Hollywood Boulevard and the one in Orlando, Fla., at 
the Disney-MGM Studio Theme Park. It's billed as "Hollywood Boulevard as you've 
always imagined it to be." Wrote Weitzman: "The Hollywood Boulevard I grew up 
on doesn't charge admission." In contrast, Disney charges $31. 
</P>
<P>
Not only that, but we understand that Disney's Hollywood Boulevard doesn't 
feature a single motorcycle outlaw playing on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Have you driven your aura, lately?

Ford -- Middle-America Ford -- has a TV commercial declaring that it's the car 
for people who don't want the "same old thing." Then it flashes a shot of Harry 
Parry, Venice's famous turbaned, guitar-playing roller skater.

<P>
Isuzu, meanwhile, has come out with an ad consisting of a fictional interview 
with a Venetian who says she bought that model because it has "more room for 
our auras."

LANDLORD-CITY FEUD ERUPTS OVER LAW ON SECURITY DEPOSITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New city ordinances designed to ease financial burdens on low-income renters 
have touched off a political donnybrook that is pitting a local landlord 
coalition against Los Angeles city officials in a fight for the rightful claim 
to apartment security deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Arguing that the money belongs to tenants, rent regulators and City Council 
members leveled sharp criticism Friday at the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los 
Angeles for suing the city in Los Angeles Superior Court to overturn a law 
requiring that owners of rent-controlled apartments pay tenants 5% interest on 
security deposits. 
</P>
<P>
The group, which says the law is biased and financially injurious, also filed a 
second suit seeking to challenge a companion ordinance that bars landlords from 
raising rent by more than 10% when adult tenants move into occupied 
rent-controlled units. Under the same ordinance, landlords cannot increase rent 
at all if the new tenant is a newborn. 
</P>
<P>
The suits seek to stop enforcement of the ordinances, which took effect earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
According to the security deposit ordinance, a landlord must begin paying 
interest on the security deposit a year after the tenant moves into the unit. 
The security-deposit ordinance affects only the 480,000 housing units subject 
to rent-control law. Thus, about 40% of the rental units in Los Angeles are 
unaffected by the measures. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, annoyed about the suit, dismissed the litigation as unfounded 
and threatened to impose even tougher measures on apartment owners. 
</P>
<P>
"The suit is nonsense," said City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents 
the 5th District on the Westside. "(The landlords) have no clue about what a 
tenant in this city is faced with in terms of finding affordable housing." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said the landlords' resistance to the ordinances showed their 
callousness toward the plight of their tenants, many of whom can only afford 
apartment units under rent-control law. 
</P>
<P>
"If they insist on pursuing this line of attack against landlord-tenant law, 
perhaps the next solution will be to simply prohibit security deposits of any 
type," said Yaroslavsky, who supported the controversial measures when the City 
Council approved them last October. "I think this will have a more deleterious 
effect on the landlord, and it might have a more positive effect on the 
creation of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ready to consider it. Perhaps it should be looked at." 
</P>
<P>
But association attorney Trevor Grimm argued that the city cannot force 
apartment owners to pay the interest because security deposits, the money 
tenants give landlords before moving into apartment units, do not belong to 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were their money, they could spend it, invest it, but they can't," said 
Grimm. "It's got a hook in it. It is an escrow account. It is meant to 
compensate the landlord for damage to the apartment, unpaid rent or the cost of 
cleaning the apartment. It loses its character as the tenants' money." 
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to prohibit security deposits would violate state law, Grimm said, 
including the current interest-payment ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials insisted that they do have the right to impose the interest 
payments. Furthermore, they said, the money indeed belongs to the tenants, that 
landlords can lay claim to security deposits only as recompense. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets down to the old story: a bank, when it takes your money, pays you 
interest; a stock pays dividends," said Yaroslavsky. "Why shouldn't a landlord 
be required to pay you interest on your money?" 
</P>
<P>
While other city officials expressed skepticism about a wholesale ban on 
security deposits, they agreed that the landlords' arguments were baseless. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it will stand up in court," said Michael Bodaken, housing 
coordinator for Mayor Tom Bradley's office. "I think that this law is a 
legitimate attempt by the city to prevent rent gouging." 
</P>
<P>
He and other officials pointed out that other major urban centers, most notably 
New York City and Chicago, have similar measures. 
</P>
<P>
Grimm complained that the ordinance discriminates against the owners of 
rent-controlled units. 
</P>
<P>
"It segregates owners of rent-controlled units, whereas owners of other units 
don't have to pay," said Grimm. 
</P>
<P>
City rent regulators said the dispute illustrates a constant war between 
landlords and tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a classic example," said Barbara Zeidman, director of rent 
stabilization for the city. "In rent control, there is very rarely an argument 
of who's right and who's wrong. It's a matter of competing rights."

SOUTH BAY MAN ARRAIGNED AS THE 'LAX SENIOR BANDIT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 64-year-old man who told police he robbed banks throughout the South Bay to 
pay his wife's medical bills was arraigned Friday. Abraham Irving Block of 
Manhattan Beach was arraigned in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on one 
count of unarmed bank robbery a day after police arrested him in Redondo Beach. 
He was released on $25,000 bail raised with the help of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Block did not enter a plea at the arraignment. A preliminary hearing was 
scheduled for Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Block, suspected of committing a string of robberies in the South Bay, told 
police he had stolen $20,000 from 12 banks in Westchester, El Segundo, 
Torrance, Redondo Beach and West Los Angeles to pay his wife's medical 
expenses, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"He had recently lost his job," Redondo Beach Police Lt. John Nelson, said. 
"Apparently bills for his wife's illness were coming in all at once . . . and 
he made the statement, 'Who's going to hire a 64-year-old man?' " 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad situation," said Nelson, adding that FBI and police investigators 
were trying to confirm that Block's wife is sick. But "a lot of people have 
bills to pay who find other means than robbing banks." 
</P>
<P>
Block's wife and son, who attended the arraignment, refused to comment on the 
case. Block's attorney, Myra Sun, told U.S. Magistrate Robert M. Stone that she 
had evidence that Block's wife "suffers from a severe illness," which would 
shed "a lot of light on the alleged crime." 
</P>
<P>
Police and the FBI had coined the name "LAX Senior Bandit" to describe the 
elusive suspect who robbed banks over a seven-month period using a plastic 
revolver to threaten tellers and a 1975 BMW as his getaway car, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber would pull his coat back, Nelson said, revealing the toy gun in his 
waistband, demand money in large bills and then walk out. "No acts of 
violence," Nelson said. "He'd just walk in and leave." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday morning, Block was driving away after allegedly robbing a Home Savings 
of America branch in Redondo Beach when a witness took down his license plate 
number, Nelson said. Block then drove to South Bay Bank in Torrance and 
committed another robbery, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By then his description had been broadcast over the police radio to officers 
throughout the South Bay. An officer patrolling the South Bay Galleria saw 
Block near a Bank of America in Redondo Beach, Nelson said. Officers pulled him 
over and arrested him. A plastic revolver was found in the car, along with an 
unspecified amount of money jammed between the front seats, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was just in the area trying to blend in with the crowd, trying to 
count his money and see if he had enough," Nelson said.

EX-U.S. AGENT'S BANKING DESCRIBED; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: DARNELL GARCIA, A FORMER DEA OFFICER, MOVED $2 MILLION THROUGH A SWISS 
INSTITUTION TO LUXEMBOURG, RECORDS SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For almost five years, former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent 
Darnell Garcia deposited more than $2 million in European bank accounts, 
according to Swiss bank records presented this week in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
The records, obtained by U.S. prosecutors under a treaty with the Swiss 
government, revealed that the money was deposited in Swiss Bank Corp. branches 
in two small towns on the Italian border, and then transferred to a branch in 
Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
The bank documents form a crucial component in the government's case against 
Garcia, who is on trial in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. Garcia, 43, of 
Rancho Palos Verdes, faces charges of drug trafficking, money laundering and 
leaking intelligence information to drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony Wednesday and Thursday, Swiss Bank official Dominik Kalberer, 
appearing for the prosecution, pointed to a blowup of Garcia's Swiss bank 
statement and told jurors it shows that on April 18, 1988, the ex-DEA agent 
walked into the bank's Luxembourg branch, withdrew more than $2 million in 
cash, and left. 
</P>
<P>
Kalberer, who is based in New York, said the Swiss banking system allows anyone 
-- including Garcia -- to use private, numbered accounts and code names when 
making telephone transactions. For his three accounts at Swiss Bank Corp., he 
testified, Garcia used the names Pedro, Brito and Tato. 
</P>
<P>
In presenting their case to the jury, prosecutors Joyce Karlin and Stefan Stein 
have underscored that Garcia's foreign bank accounts represent profits he made 
trafficking in cocaine and heroin with two other DEA agents. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's attorneys, Mark Overland and Mark Borenstein, are attempting to show 
that much of Garcia's fortune was generated by commissions he made through 
smuggling gold jewelry for an Italian-based firm, Oro Aurora, which had an 
outlet in Los Angeles' jewelry district. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Swiss bank's figures, Garcia opened his account in the Italian 
border town of Chiasso with a cash deposit of $100 on Nov. 8, 1983. Then, 
through April, 1985, Garcia deposited 45 cashier's checks, totaling $372,215. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the Internal Revenue Service, who have played a key role on 
a government task force compiling evidence in the DEA's worst corruption case, 
believe that they have located all of the American banks from which the 
cashier's checks were purchased. 
</P>
<P>
In laying out its case, the government questioned the Swiss banker in great 
detail about Garcia's transactions between 1983 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Records show that from June, 1985, to November, 1987, Garcia deposited 
$1,712,249 in the Swiss Bank Corp.'s branch in Mendrisio, Switzerland. Almost 
$1 million of the money was deposited in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The government is attempting to prove that this cash represented profits from 
the theft of 396 pounds of cocaine from a Pasadena garage in November, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Former DEA Agent John Jackson, who has pleaded guilty to taking part in the 
Pasadena theft and other charges, told jurors he carried a briefcase bulging 
with cash past airport security by flashing his DEA credentials and boarded a 
flight for Europe. Prosecutors are attempting to prove that Garcia -- Jackson's 
DEA partner at the time -- also carried large sums of drug money abroad. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the government said, Garcia instructed the Swiss Bank Corp. 
branch in Mendrisio to wire $420,000 to his account at Santa Monica Bank. These 
funds were ultimately used to help purchase a $585,000 house in Rancho Palos 
Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the money-laundering counts against Garcia refer to this transaction. 
Prosecutors allege that Garcia laundered drug money from a foreign account to a 
U.S. account and then laundered the cash through the purchase of his house. 
</P>
<P>
According to bank records, Garcia transferred $1.88 million from Mendrisio to a 
bank branch in Luxembourg on Oct. 9, 1987. By then, according to the testimony 
of a government witness, Garcia was concerned that he was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Six months later, Garcia withdrew $2,084,500 from the Luxembourg bank and took 
it to a branch of Union Bank of Switzerland, where the funds were deposited. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1988, Garcia was a fugitive. He was arrested in 1989.

to seek such approval unless he could count on an overwhelming endorsement, 
which the White House feels is now uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
In Baghdad, meanwhile, Iraqi officials are pessimistic that any talks with 
Washington will take place. 
</P>
<P>
"We think President Bush has retreated from the idea of talks. He is resorting 
to war," a senior Foreign Ministry official said. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 30, the day after the U.N. Security Council set a Jan. 15, 1991, 
deadline for Iraq to pull out of Kuwait, Bush proposed that Iraqi Foreign 
Minister Tarik Aziz visit Washington and that Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III travel to Iraq to see Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, Bush had said, was ready to travel on any "mutually convenient" day 
between Dec. 15 and Jan. 15. However, when Iraq suggested Jan. 12 for Baker's 
visit, Bush responded that that is too close to the 15th and said Jan. 3 is the 
latest acceptable date. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish now that I had been a little more explicit in my first announcement on 
what I meant by 'mutually convenient dates' " for the exchange of visits, Bush 
said at a news conference. "But I was not then and am not now prepared to have 
this man (Hussein) manipulate the purpose of the secretary of state's visit." 
</P>
<P>
The inability of Washington and Baghdad to agree on dates for the two visits 
has put Bush in a bind: In proposing the exchange of envoys, Bush said he is 
willing to go the extra mile to avoid bloodshed. But by refusing to let Baker 
meet with Hussein after Jan. 3, the President risks appearing intransigent. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Hussein's refusal to see Baker by Jan. 3 would mean there would 
be no meetings, Bush said: "I don't like to draw deadlines in the sand here. 
But there'd have to be some compelling reason for me to change it because I 
don't want to move this up against the United Nations deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"That deadline is real," he said, adding that Iraqi forces must be "totally 
out, totally out" by then. 
</P>
<P>
In acknowledging that he is considering asking Congress in January to authorize 
"offensive action," Bush sought to avoid angering members of the House and 
Senate who have encouraged him to put the issue before them. Congressional 
allies have argued that a display of strong support would send a clear signal 
to Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
However, White House officials fear that such a vote would be risky because 
Congress could instead thwart the President by recommending that he give 
economic sanctions more time to force an Iraqi withdrawal -- or by simply 
giving him a less-than-overwhelming vote of approval. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, officials said that despite Bush's comments, he is no closer 
to taking such an approach than he was several weeks ago when Senate Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) first proposed it. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with reporters on a sun-drenched White House lawn before leaving by 
helicopter to spend the weekend at Camp David, Md., Bush sought to blame 
Hussein for the failure to reach an agreement on dates for the proposed visits. 
</P>
<P>
"We've offered 15 dates, and he ought to get moving and do something reasonable 
if he really wants to move for peace," Bush said, stressing that he is trying 
"to show flexibility" but that Iraq has proposed only one date for Baker's 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
"In offering to go the extra mile for peace, however, I did not offer to be a 
party to Saddam Hussein's manipulation," the President said Friday, reading 
from a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the numerous meetings the Iraqi president has held with foreign 
visitors, Bush continued: 
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein is not too busy to see, on short notice, Kurt Waldheim, Willy 
Brandt, Muhammad Ali, Ted Heath, John Connally, Ramsey Clark, and many, many 
others on very short notice. 
</P>
<P>
"And it simply is not credible that he cannot, over a two-week period, make a 
couple of hours available for the secretary of state on an issue of this 
importance unless, of course, he is seeking to circumvent the United Nations 
deadline." 
</P>
<P>
The United States is intending to use the proposed meetings not for 
negotiations but as a last opportunity to insist that all Iraqi troops be 
withdrawn from Kuwait by the Jan. 15 deadline or face the use of force to 
remove them. But the concern within the Administration is that on Jan. 12, 
Hussein could tell Baker in Baghdad that three days are not sufficient to carry 
out the withdrawal of Iraqi troops. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the two visits -- that of the Iraqi foreign minister to Washington 
-- "is on hold," Bush acknowledged Friday. The Iraqis had proposed that it take 
place Monday -- a date to which the Administration did not object as long as 
Hussein would see Baker on a follow-up visit by Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
In his news conference, Bush reiterated his concern about Hussein's chemical 
weapons arsenal and his potential for developing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"Any arrangement that is going to keep the rest of the world happy will have to 
address itself to this unconventional war capability of Saddam Hussein. Anybody 
that will take the reckless action he has taken militarily against a neighbor 
must be contained in this era when we're all concerned about nuclear 
proliferation," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hussein said Iraq is prepared for combat. 
</P>
<P>
"If the enemies want to push the situation toward a military showdown, we 
shall, with the blessing of God, win and we shall walk over their dead bodies 
and their heads," he said, according to accounts published Friday. 
</P>
<P>
While Bush complained about Iraq's refusal to accept any of the dates he 
suggested for Baker's visit to Baghdad, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told a 
congressional hearing that he sees "absolutely no indication" that sanctions or 
other pressures are lessening Hussein's determination. 
</P>
<P>
"Patience," Cheney told the House Armed Services Committee, "is not producing 
results." 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Iraqi forces 
"continue to pour into the Kuwait theater of operations," which encompasses 
Kuwait and southern Iraq. The troops number more than 500,000, and there are 
also 4,000 tanks, 2,500 personnel carriers and other armored vehicles and 2,700 
artillery pieces, he said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. forces throughout the gulf region number more than 260,000, with another 
2,000 arriving daily -- a rate of increase that will double in the weeks ahead 
in line with Bush's Nov. 8 decision to raise the U.S. troop strength to about 
400,000 personnel, Powell told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), the committee chairman, asked whether "we've created a 
use-it-or-lose-it force in the Persian Gulf" -- one so large that it must go to 
war because it cannot be sustained indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Powell acknowledged that sustaining the force would be difficult over the long 
run, but he said it should pose no problem over the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
Powell also denied that the Administration is eager to bring the confrontation 
to a head before February because winter sandstorms and other adverse weather 
conditions later on would hamper the United States' ability to fight a desert 
war and use air power. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to go to war based on weather forecasts," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that weather is "a factor," but he added that "those who are for 
waiting and those who are for going ahead as soon as possible should not use 
weather as a basis for making that decision. The stakes are much too important 
just to hang arguments on the basis of 'It's just too cold,' or 'It's just too 
hot.' "

REP. MARTIN IS BUSH CHOICE FOR LABOR SECRETARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>

<P>
President Bush tapped outgoing Rep. Lynn Martin of Illinois as his new 
secretary of labor Friday, rewarding her for party loyalty in giving up her 
safe Republican House seat at the urging of the White House to run an 
unsuccessful campaign last month against Democratic Sen. Paul Simon. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, 51, who was caught off guard by the timing of the announcement, is a 
fiscal conservative who voted against the interests of organized labor during 
most of her 10 years in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Her nomination received a cool reception from Lane Kirkland, president of the 
AFL-CIO, who said that "her voting record has not reflected a sensitivity to 
the needs of workers." 
</P>
<P>
If confirmed by the Senate, Martin would become the Administration's principal 
contact with major labor leaders. She would inherit a difficult-to-manage 
department whose functions include supervision of billions of dollars in 
pension funds and the enforcement of health and safety rules in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
The sharp-tongued lawmaker, known for her acerbic wit, was at her home in Loves 
Park, Ill., after being told there would be no action this week on the labor 
post. Her office said she had no prepared statement. Martin would replace 
Elizabeth Hanford Dole, who was the only woman in the Bush Cabinet until she 
resigned in October to head the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
Martin's closest competitor for the labor post was believed to be another 
outgoing Republican congresswoman, Patricia Saiki of Hawaii, who had the strong 
support of Elizabeth Dole's husband, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of 
Kansas. White House sources said Bob Dole phoned John H. Sununu, Bush's chief 
of staff, immediately after the Martin announcement to push Saiki for the 
vacant education secretary post. 
</P>
<P>
Lauro F. Cavazos resigned the Education Department post earlier this week after 
his management skills were sharply criticized by Sununu. Saiki tried 
unsuccessfully last month -- as did Martin -- to defeat a Democratic incumbent 
senator. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Saiki, other top candidates for education secretary include Lynne V. 
Cheney, chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities and wife of 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney; former New Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean, now 
president of Drew University, and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, 
president of the University of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also is seeking to fill the post of Republican national chairman following 
this week's announcement by former drug policy adviser William J. Bennett, the 
man he had selected for it, that he was declining the position because of 
ethical considerations arising from his intention to carry on a simultaneous 
speaking and writing career. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who favors legal abortions and supported the rejected equal rights 
amendment, is married to a federal judge in Chicago, Harry Leinenweber. She has 
two children by her first marriage to a Rockford, Ill., businessman. She has 
sponsored day-care projects and is a former high school economics and 
government teacher. 
</P>
<P>
The President made the announcement on the White House lawn before departing by 
helicopter for a weekend at his Camp David retreat in the Maryland mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Martin as "an outstanding member of Congress" who had served as 
"an unofficial adviser to me," Bush added: "She's a mother who knows the need 
for child care." The President also commended her as "a professional" who 
understands the relationship between business and labor. 
</P>
<P>
Martin helped prepare Bush in 1984 when, as vice president, he debated the 
Democratic vice presidential candidate, Geraldine A. Ferraro. She was a 
national co-chairman of his presidential campaign two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Martin made her Senate bid this year with the help of Roger Ailes, who served 
as Bush's image-maker in the 1988 presidential campaign. Critics blamed Ailes 
for the bitterness of her attacks on Simon. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate Labor and Human 
Resources Committee, said he looked forward to holding confirmation hearings 
for Martin early next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The Department of Labor needs a strong secretary who is willing to stand up 
for hard-pressed families against the constant pro-business tilt of the White 
House," Kennedy said.

EDWIN LESTER, CIVIC LIGHT OPERA FOUNDER, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edwin Lester, the undisputed doyen of West Coast musicals and the founder and 
longtime director of Los Angeles' Civic Light Opera, has died. He was 95. 
</P>
<P>
Lester died Thursday night of cardiac arrest at his Beverly Hills home. He had 
been in failing health for several months. 
</P>
<P>
Four of Lester's more than nine decades were spent bringing to Los Angeles and 
then San Francisco thousands of the most melodious hours in the American 
musical theater. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1938 and 1977, when he retired, he offered a minimum of four musicals a 
year in settings ranging from a church stage, where scenery could not be hung 
or lighting set until after the final singing of the doxology, to the Music 
Center, where Lester's productions helped ensure the financial stability of the 
then-infant cultural arena. 
</P>
<P>
In those 40 years, the Civic Light Opera had offered more than 160 productions, 
90 of them produced by Lester. 
</P>
<P>
They included Mary Martin in "Peter Pan," Paul Robeson in "Show Boat," Ethel 
Merman in "Gypsy" and Katharine Hepburn in "Coco." 
</P>
<P>
In 1943, he even lured Rudolf Friml to appear as himself at the piano in a 
staging of the composer's "Firefly." 
</P>
<P>
Five of Lester's shows ("Song of Norway," "Kismet," "Magdalena," "Gigi" and 
"Peter Pan") went from Los Angeles to Broadway at a time when the rivers of 
musical drama normally flowed in the opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
In his initial season alone, he featured an established operatic star, John 
Charles Thomas, in the light opera, "Blossom Time"; cast a young singer named 
Stanley Morner who later became better known as Dennis Morgan in "Student 
Prince," and hired a neophyte comedian named Bob Hope to make his theatrical 
debut in "Roberta." 
</P>
<P>
He also helped launch the stage careers of John Raitt, Gwen Verdon, Carole 
Landis, Jerome Hines and George London. 
</P>
<P>
But if Lester's stars and shows were legion his business practices were 
legendary. 
</P>
<P>
At his retirement he had compiled one of the most sophisticated and successful 
subscription lists in the history of American theater. Ninety-five percent of 
all Civic Light Opera seats were sold in advance to subscribers, many of whose 
parents and grandparents were in the 1938 opening-night audience. 
</P>
<P>
When he moved the Civic Light Opera to the Music Center in 1965 -- after 
deciding against purchasing the Pantages Theater for $1 million -- he brought 
with him 1,000 guarantors. Ninety-six percent of those guarantors, who got 
favored seating in exchange for financial support, had renewed their pledges 
from previous seasons. It was believed to be largest theatrical support crowd 
in the world and those guarantors helped solidify the Music Center's base as it 
first opened and then began to expand. 
</P>
<P>
The impresario who thought of himself as a "sounding board" for artists and an 
"editor" of his productions, was himself a budding musician at age 10, playing 
the piano and singing in Providence, R. I., where he was raised the son of a 
retail merchant. 
</P>
<P>
Lester billed himself as "The Great Boy Baritone," although he was really an 
alto, in Rhode Island pubs and later in vaudeville. He performed his vaudeville 
act on the old Pantages circuit after a brief stay in officers' training school 
near the close of World War I. 
</P>
<P>
But when his voice changed, his career goals had to follow suit. So he began to 
sell musical instruments, then moved to Los Angeles and Universal Pictures as 
sales manager when the Depression sharply curtailed the sale of band 
instruments. 
</P>
<P>
Lester found studio life frustrating ("I didn't like all that haggling") and 
became agent, manager and adviser for "all the really first class singers in L. 
A." -- Nelson Eddy among them. 
</P>
<P>
By now, however, movies were "singing," too, and the rash of musicals coming 
out of Hollywood sound stages was cutting sharply into live entertainment 
ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
By 1935 he decided to not just manage his stable of singers but employ them as 
well. He borrowed $500 each from 10 friends and somehow managed to launch Los 
Angeles' first light opera festival. He not only made it through 1935 but 1936 
and 1937 as well. 
</P>
<P>
The following year the Civic Light Opera was officially begun on a budget of 
$100,000 for four shows, the number of productions that marked most of Lester's 
subsequent seasons. 
</P>
<P>
He lured John Charles Thomas from the opera stage to the Temple Baptist 
Church's Philharmonic Auditorium at a then-unheard-of $7,500 a week. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas lent the same dignity and legitimacy to the Civic Light Opera that 
Enrico Caruso had brought to phonograph recordings 30 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The rest, as the cliche goes, was history. 
</P>
<P>
In 1939, Thomas returned, this time in the American premiere of "Gypsy Baron," 
and in 1940, Paul Robeson was wildly acclaimed in "Show Boat." "Savoy 
Serenade," the first of the Civic Light Opera originals, also graced the 1940 
season as did Helen Morgan, Verdon, Hines and Raitt. 
</P>
<P>
Lester had wanted to bring "Porgy and Bess" to Los Angeles in 1941, but when 
negotiations stalled he imported the first of his Broadway successes, "Cabin in 
the Sky," the black spiritual-musical. In it he put Ethel Waters, the dancer 
Katherine Dunham and a young actor named Dooley Wilson who was to become "Sam," 
the pianist and philosopher who touched film audiences with "As Time Goes By" 
in the movie "Casablanca." 
</P>
<P>
In 1943, Lester first involved San Francisco in his productions when he asked 
for some financial assistance for "Lady in the Dark," the collaboration of Moss 
Hart, Ira Gershwin and Kurt Weill that had become Gertrude Lawrence's signature 
on Broadway. That musical about the woman editor torn between her career and 
three suitors was seen that year in both Los Angeles and San Francisco, marking 
the beginning of an affiliation that has lasted four decades and added 100,000 
subscribers to the 150,000 already pledged here. 
</P>
<P>
He basically stuck to his four shows each season over the years, but 
occasionally would add a fifth as an added inducement for his growing list of 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
And, as is often the case, as the scope of his endeavor grew, so did his 
critics. 
</P>
<P>
He was chastised often for "over-popularizing" in the interpretations of some 
operettas, using less talented film stars in roles better suited to established 
stage actors and taken to task for not offering more original or imaginative 
material. 
</P>
<P>
Lester, a longtime widower who was childless, is survived by two cousins, Mary 
Greenebaum, of Louisville, and Ann Meranus, of Cincinnati. At Lester's 
insistence, there will be no services. The family has requested that any 
memorial contributions be made to the Actors' Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Lester had established a tradition of personally responding to individual 
complaints from patrons. He adapted that technique to his media critics, and 
editors found that his ripostes often ran to greater length than the original 
critiques. 
</P>
<P>
One of his standard and proudest responses to critics over the decades might 
well serve as the engraving on a future monument to him: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't ever remember a single time when people asked for their money back." 
</P>

ANC LEADER URGES SHIFT IN STAND ON SANCTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SOWETO, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
African National Congress President Oliver R. Tambo, opening a historic 
nationwide ANC conference Friday, urged his black liberation movement to 
consider for the first time softening its stand on sanctions against South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"It is no longer enough for us to repeat the tired slogans," said Tambo, 73, 
delivering the first speech since his return Thursday from 30 years in exile. 
"We should . . . carefully re-evaluate the advisability of insisting on the 
retention of sanctions, given the new developments in the country and abroad." 
</P>
<P>
Tambo's recommendation signaled an important change in strategy for the ANC, 
which until now has publicly insisted that sanctions be maintained until a new 
constitution has been adopted or, at the least, "profound and irreversible" 
change has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Many ANC leaders have begun to worry that, no matter what the ANC says, the 
United States and other foreign countries may soon ease or remove sanctions 
against Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
World leaders, including President Bush, have said they want to reward 
President Frederik W. de Klerk for his reform initiatives and encourage him to 
continue to dismantle apartheid and begin negotiations with black leaders. 
</P>
<P>
As Tambo spoke Friday, a summit of European Community leaders in Rome was 
considering a proposal to lift its ban on new investments in South Africa. The 
ban is a voluntary part of the EC's 1986 sanctions package, which prohibits 
importing South African gold coins, iron and steel. Britain and Italy already 
have lifted their bans on South African investments. 
</P>
<P>
The likelihood of a modification of sanctions by the EC in coming weeks, and 
the possibility that the Bush Administration will soon determine that De Klerk 
has met most of the conditions for easing U.S. sanctions, has forced the ANC to 
reconsider its position. 
</P>
<P>
ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela has written European Community leaders, 
urging them to hold off on removing sanctions at least until February, when De 
Klerk is expected to announce plans to remove laws segregating neighborhoods 
and restricting black ownership of land. 
</P>
<P>
But a confidential discussion document being formally circulated at the ANC's 
three-day conference says that if the ANC remains rigid on sanctions and they 
begin to erode anyway, the movement will "suffer a major defeat." 
</P>
<P>
"Then the perception will be created that the government has scored a major 
victory over the ANC, having succeeded in persuading the world to lift 
sanctions," the document adds. 
</P>
<P>
The document, which will be debated at the conference, recommends that the ANC 
take control of the sanctions debate by drawing up a step-by-step sanctions 
modification program linked to government reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC's concern, according to Tambo, is that "at no stage should we ever 
allow the strategic initiative to shift to the other side." 
</P>
<P>
ANC-inspired sanctions against South Africa have isolated the country 
diplomatically, economically and culturally. Among the stiffest sanctions are 
those contained in the U.S. Anti-Apartheid Act, which restricts American 
investment and the purchase of South African products. 
</P>
<P>
While economic sanctions have eaten into South Africans' pocketbooks, an array 
of international cultural, educational and sports boycotts have had a strong 
psychological impact. 
</P>
<P>
Pretoria has long fought sanctions, arguing that those policies hurt the black 
majority more than the white minority by creating unemployment and making the 
government too poor to raise the standard of living of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
But government opponents say that without the sanctions campaign, the 
government would have taken even longer to begin dismantling apartheid and come 
to the negotiating table. And lifting the pressure of sanctions from the 
government now, some in the ANC argue, would slow the pace of reform. 
</P>
<P>
The sanctions discussion document, entitled "Managing the Period of 
Transition," suggests that the ANC consider loosening the cultural, educational 
and sports boycotts. It also recommends that the ANC encourage foreign 
investments in programs that will directly improve the living conditions of the 
nation's 28 million blacks, beset by high unemployment and severe housing 
shortages. 
</P>
<P>
However, the document recommends that the oil and arms embargo, as well as 
sanctions against development loans, remain in place as long as the white 
minority controls the government. 
</P>
<P>
The future of sanctions is one of the primary topics up for discussion among 
the 1,600 delegates to the conference, which ends Sunday. Others include the 
escalating black factional fighting in Johannesburg-area townships, the ANC's 
negotiations strategy and the status of the recently suspended armed struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates also are expected to raise questions about the operations of the ANC, 
which has had difficulty making the transition from a revolutionary movement to 
a legal, democratic political organization. 
</P>
<P>
Tambo acknowledged the criticism of ANC leaders indirectly on Friday, telling 
the conference that the ANC must "root ourselves amongst the people . . . and, 
jointly with them, find ways to advance our cause. Conditions of illegality, 
which in the past imposed some limitations on our adherence to principles of 
democracy, no longer prevail." 
</P>
<P>
The ANC president said that protest marches and other forms of mass action may 
soon replace the armed struggle and sanctions as the predominant form of 
liberation struggle. And he urged the ANC to organize "all South Africans, 
black and white, . . . into a mighty vehicle of liberation." 
</P>
<P>
Both Tambo and Mandela expressed concern about the level of violence, which has 
soared since the ANC and other anti-apartheid groups were legalized in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, 3,460 people, most of them black, have died in political 
violence in South Africa -- more than have died in 11 years of conflict in 
Northern Ireland, according to the South African Institute of Race Relations. 
Since July, 1,020 people have died in factional fighting in Johannesburg-area 
townships. 
</P>
<P>
"The massacres in the townships and elsewhere are a painful reminder that 
apartheid is still firmly in place," Tambo said. "Accordingly, the struggle 
against apartheid should be intensified on all fronts." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, in his keynote speech to the conference, said most of the black 
factional fighting was "neither the outcome of political rivalry nor the 
expression of political intolerance among the oppressed." Instead, he said, it 
was part of "an orchestrated campaign of counterrevolutionary violence" to 
destroy confidence in the ANC and its leadership."

<P>
A lobbyist for former Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr. 
said Friday that moments after he first met Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) at a 
political event in 1984, the senator suggested Keating should contribute to his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
James Grogan also told the Senate Ethics Committee he remembers more than one 
occasion on which Cranston or his aides sought contributions from Keating while 
at the same time promising to assist Lincoln in its battle against federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston has acknowledged only one such conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan, a surprise witness who testified under a limited grant of immunity from 
prosecution, said there was never a trade-off between Keating's contributions 
and his request for assistance. But he appeared to strengthen the committee's 
case against both Cranston and Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.). He provided 
important new details of Cranston's close alliance with Keating and 
contradicted earlier testimony by Cranston aides Joy Jacobson and Carolyn D. 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
The panel is investigating charges that Cranston, Riegle and three others -- 
Sens. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain (R-Ariz.) and John Glenn (D-Ohio) 
-- improperly assisted Keating in exchange for contributions. Their 
intervention with federal regulators allegedly delayed the government takeover 
of Lincoln, contributing to losses of $2 billion by the federally insured 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan, 36, who was paid $300,000 a year to lobby for Lincoln, recalled that he 
introduced himself to Cranston at an event in 1984, explaining that he worked 
for an Arizona builder who had just purchased a savings and loan in California. 
</P>
<P>
He said Cranston promptly pulled a 3x5 card from his pocket, saying: "I've been 
very good to the savings and loans. I've worked hard for California savings and 
loans. You all should really support me." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston then wrote Grogan's name and telephone number on the card, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, according to Grogan, he received a telephone call from 
Jacobson, the senator's fund-raiser. He said she repeated Cranston's contention 
that he had been "very supportive" of California thrifts and asked him if 
Keating would raise money for the senator. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan indicated he was surprised by this aggressive appeal for money because 
Keating is a conservative Republican who opposes abortion, and Cranston is a 
liberal Democrat who is an abortion rights advocate. As a result, he said, he 
did not immediately commit Keating to anything during his first conversation 
with Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
He said he later persuaded Keating to assist Cranston by telling him that the 
senator shared his negative opinion of then-Federal Home Loan Bank Board 
Chairman Edwin J. Gray. Keating disagreed with Gray's policies and later 
accused the bank board chairman of carrying on a "vendetta" against Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1985, as a result of Cranston's appeal for funds, Keating collected 
$15,000 in checks from his employees for the California senator. It was the 
first of nearly $1 million that Cranston solicited from Keating -- $60,000 for 
his campaigns, $85,000 for the California Democratic Party and $850,000 for 
voter registration groups founded by the senator. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Grogan emphasized that Keating did not always have Cranston's 
support for his proposals. He said contributions could buy him access to a 
senator, but the money provided no guarantee that the senator would do the 
bidding of a contributor. 
</P>
<P>
"For example," he told the committee, "Sen. Cranston, whom I believe we gave 
the most money to, there were several times specifically when I went to his 
office and asked him, on behalf of Mr. Keating, to take action. And he said, 
'No, I can't do it.' And this was after tremendous amounts of money had been 
raised for him." 
</P>
<P>
Grogan contradicted earlier testimony by Jacobson, who said that she -- not 
Cranston -- was approached at the 1984 Democratic National Convention by 
Grogan, who "offered to be helpful to the reelection campaign." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Keating, who eventually developed a warm friendship with Cranston, 
usually waited until the end of his meetings with the senator to discuss 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
As Grogan explained it: "Normally as we were leaving, either Mr. Keating would 
say, 'Is there any way I can help you, senator? I appreciate our relationship.' 
Or at times, Sen. Cranston would say, 'Could you help in this area, could you 
help raise money here, could you do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
He added: "There was never an occasion where Mr. Keating asked Sen. Cranston to 
do something, and Sen. Cranston said, 'Only if you raise funds for me.' There 
was never an occasion where Mr. Keating said, 'If you do this for me, I will 
raise X-amount of dollars for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by special counsel Robert S. Bennett, Grogan detailed the 
following occasions on which he said Cranston or his aides allegedly sought 
contributions while at the same time pledging to assist Keating with 
regulators: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In late 1986, when the Senate was considering legislation that would have 
imposed restraints on Keating's management of Lincoln, Grogan tried to contact 
Jordan, Cranston's aide on the Banking Committee, for assistance in battling 
the proposal. Unable to reach Jordan, he instead talked to Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
When Jacobson called back an hour later to report that she had told Jordan of 
Keating's opposition, she then said she wanted to "switch gears" and discuss 
something "totally unrelated." She asked him whether Cranston could get a 
personal loan for his reelection campaign from Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Cranston's campaign subsequently received a $300,000 line of 
credit from Lincoln that he never used. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In September, 1987, Grogan personally delivered two checks totaling 
$250,000 for voter registration to Cranston in his office in the Capitol. "Mr. 
Keating wanted me to give you those checks," he told the senator. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan and Cranston then discussed Lincoln's problems, with Keating joining the 
conversation over the office speaker phone. Keating asked Cranston to contact 
then-bank board Chairman M. Danny Wall on Lincoln's behalf, and the senator 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In January, 1988, Grogan, Keating, Cranston, Cranston's son, Kim, and Kim's 
then-girlfriend, actress Shelley Duvall, had dinner together at Jimmy's 
restaurant in Los Angeles. Kim explained the work of Cranston's voter 
registration groups, one of which he headed, and Cranston offered to make two 
telephone calls suggested by Keating. In one call, Cranston arranged a meeting 
for Keating with Wall. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston has previously acknowledged that both contributions and assistance for 
Lincoln were discussed at the dinner. Grogan could not remember any discussion 
of specific amounts of money that Keating would contribute to the voter 
registration effort. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan contradicted testimony by Jordan concerning a written statement she 
inserted into the Congressional Record on Cranston's behalf in 1987 that 
assisted Lincoln in a pending court suit against the bank board. Jordan told 
the committee she acted entirely on her own initiative, but Grogan said she was 
acting on his request. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan also contradicted Riegle's statement that he did not arrange meetings 
between the five senators and federal regulators in early April, 1987. These 
meetings have been a central focus of the so-called Keating Five case because 
the regulators alleged that they were asked improperly by the senators to go 
easy on Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was during Riegle's visit to Keating's headquarters in Phoenix in 
March, 1987, that the senator first proposed the idea of such meetings. He said 
he later learned that Riegle had contacted Gray, who consented to meet with the 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan said Riegle, who was in line to become chairman of the Senate Banking 
Committee, had also insisted he himself could not attend such a meeting with 
the regulators unless he was invited by McCain and DeConcini, who represented 
the state where Keating lived. 
</P>
<P>
"It was apparent to me . . . Sen. Riegle knew as a true politician that this 
was a potential politically explosive situation because there was so much media 
at the time about Mr. Keating and Mr. Gray fighting," he said.

About 600 Libyan prisoners of war said to have been trained by the United 
States in Chad to destabilize the regime of Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi are 
being flown to Zaire, state radio reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Zairian radio, monitored in Congo, said the prisoners were being taken to a 
U.S.-run base at Kamina. 
</P>
<P>
The 600 dissident soldiers, who were among 2,000 captured by Chad during its 
war with Libya in the mid-1980s but who later renounced support for the Libyan 
strongman, were evacuated from Chad by the United States amid great secrecy 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The evacuation followed the Dec. 1 overthrow of the anti-Kadafi Chadian 
government of Hissen Habre by the Libyan-supplied forces of Gen. Idriss Deby. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcast said Zaire had accepted the prisoners with the approval of Libya, 
which preferred to see them housed in Zaire rather than some other country. 
</P>
<P>
Libya has said the prisoners were held in U.S.-run camps in Chad and forced to 
train as anti-Kadafi terrorists.

Germany proposed Friday to set a tight quota on the immigration of Soviet Jews, 
accepting as few as 1,000 a year despite tens of thousands of applications. 
According to spokesmen, the interior ministers of the 16 German states, meeting 
in Dresden, were nearly unanimous in support of the limit.

BUSH RISKS LOSING THE HIGH GROUND BY ENGAGING HUSSEIN IN DEBATE OVER DATES; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: HE MUST FIND OTHER WAYS TO SHOW HE WANTS TO AVOID WAR. THE PEACE 
INITIATIVE MAY PASS TO OTHER NATIONS.

<P>
By getting into a test of wills with Saddam Hussein over dates for talks, 
President Bush risks losing the diplomatic high ground and now must search for 
other ways to show the nation and the world that he is not rushing into war. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department official said Friday that no other initiatives are presently 
planned if Hussein refuses to budge in his refusal to meet Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III before Jan. 12 -- a date that Bush considers too close to 
the U.N. deadline of Jan. 15, 1991, for Iraq to get out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that is being kicked around is a public diplomacy effort to 
show both the domestic and the international audience that we made a good faith 
effort and the Iraqis blocked it," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the deadlock over dates could pass the initiative to other 
nations. For instance, French officials have said that Paris may attempt to 
talk with Hussein if the United States is unable to do so. And Algerian 
President Chadli Bendjedid visited Baghdad this week in search of a negotiated 
end to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
If Bush is correct in his assessment that Hussein is stalling in an effort to 
delay for as long as possible the use of force against him, the Iraqi dictator 
can be expected to produce a flurry of diplomatic activity as the Jan. 15 
deadline draws closer. 
</P>
<P>
If, as seems likely, Hussein proposes a settlement that falls short of U.S. 
objectives, the Bush Administration would be better positioned to reject it if 
the proposal is given to Baker instead of a representative of some other 
country. 
</P>
<P>
When the U.N. Security Council voted Nov. 29 to authorize the use of force 
against Iraq, most members of the council insisted on giving Hussein until Jan. 
15 to pull his forces out of Kuwait, creating what members called a six-week 
"pause for peace." But it became clear almost immediately that no one really 
had any idea about how to use the time to end the crisis peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
Bush stepped into the vacuum the next day, proposing that Iraqi Foreign 
Minister Tarik Aziz visit Washington and that Baker travel to Iraq. At the 
time, Bush said Baker was ready to travel on any "mutually convenient" day 
between Dec. 15 and Jan. 15. But when Baghdad suggested Jan. 12, the President 
decided that was too late and demanded that the visit take place no later than 
Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between the two proposals is only nine days. But in diplomatic 
terms, it is an eternity. 
</P>
<P>
"If Hussein backs off Jan. 12 or Bush backs off Jan. 3, then one will have 
blinked," said Geoffrey Kemp, a National Security Council expert on the Middle 
East during the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp, now a senior associate of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 
said the President "is now paying the price for a strategically brilliant but 
tactically inept statement on Nov. 30. He should never have allowed the Iraqis 
such a wide window. It was clear from the beginning that the Iraqis were going 
to play games with it, and that's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Hunter, a National Security Council staff member in the Jimmy Carter 
Administration, said he sympathizes with Bush's pique at Iraq's delaying 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
But he said Bush's statement Friday "does not make war any more politically 
acceptable to the American people." 
</P>
<P>
When Bush first proposed the exchange of foreign envoys two weeks ago, 
Administration officials conceded that the President did not really expect to 
be able to persuade Hussein to comply with the U.N. resolutions. But the 
officials said Bush had to show the American public and the world that he had 
made every reasonable effort to avoid war if he hoped to gain needed support 
for a decision to order U.S. troops into combat. 
</P>
<P>
If the impasse continues over dates for the Aziz and Baker trips, Bush may find 
it more difficult to show that he exhausted all peaceful measures. 
</P>
<P>
In place of Baker's trip to Baghdad, the Administration would hold high-level 
consultations with other members of the international coalition opposing the 
Iraqi invasion. But these talks would be intended primarily to avoid defections 
from the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Baker will be in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday to confer with other foreign 
ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. As an alliance, NATO has 
taken no action in the Persian Gulf crisis. But most members have contributed 
money or troops or both. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, are scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia next week to confer with 
Saudi authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials also have said Baker hopes to meet in Europe soon with 
the foreign ministers of Britain, France, the Soviet Union and China -- the 
four other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. The British and 
French ministers will be at the NATO meeting, but the State Department has 
announced no new contacts with Soviet or Chinese officials. 
</P>
<P>
However, contacts with allies are not expected to persuade the public that Bush 
has "gone the extra mile," as he put it earlier.

U.S. DIPLOMAT HOWELL COMES HOME A HERO; 
</P>
<P>
HOSTAGES: HE SAYS THAT 'WE COULD DO NOTHING ELSE' BUT HOLD OUT IN THE BESIEGED 
KUWAIT EMBASSY UNTIL ALL AMERICANS WERE FREE.

<P>
Calling them "victorious" and heroic, Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
welcomed back U.S. diplomats from Kuwait city and the last group of American 
and Canadian hostages from Kuwait and Iraq on Friday at Andrews Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howell III, who along with a skeleton staff had 
withstood threats and deprivation to keep open the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait, 
declared that "we could do nothing else" but hold firm in the besieged compound 
until the last Americans were freed. 
</P>
<P>
"Yesterday morning, I locked the door on the embassy and left the garrison flag 
flying," Howell told the crowd of well-wishers at Andrews Air Force Base. "The 
embassy will reopen in a free Kuwait." 
</P>
<P>
He called President Bush's policy in the Persian Gulf "moral and honorable and 
right." 
</P>
<P>
"Make no mistake," Howell said, "the only industry in Kuwait today is war and 
military occupation." 
</P>
<P>
"I left Iraqis building bunkers around the seacoast and around our embassy. I 
saw no indication that they plan to leave," said the ambassador, 50, who warded 
off the clear December chill with a tan raincoat. 
</P>
<P>
The 48 passengers cheered and waved as they walked off the C-5 military 
transport plane onto a red carpet shortly after 4 p.m. and into the warm 
embraces of about 400 family members. 
</P>
<P>
Roses, green and silver balloons and, in one case, a full-length fur coat 
greeted the passengers -- 23 Americans, 10 spouses and children of Americans, 
and 15 Canadians. After 132 days in detention -- either in the embassy or in 
hiding -- the former hostages left Baghdad on Thursday and spent the night in 
Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Calling Iraqi President Saddam Hussein a "vicious and capricious dictator" and 
an international outlaw, Baker told the delegation: "Your ordeal is over, but 
the ordeal of the Kuwaiti people continues." 
</P>
<P>
Baker told the former hostages that Hussein "deserves no thanks, no reward" for 
releasing the foreign nationals, some of whom were detained as "human shields" 
at military and industrial sites to deter a possible attack from U.S.-led 
forces against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Howell, with a spirited step, was the first to walk off the plane. He stood 
beside his wife with his hands behind his back as he listened to Baker's 
welcoming speech. 
</P>
<P>
Howell kept the embassy open in defiance of an Iraqi order that all foreign 
embassies in Kuwait close by Aug. 24. He said it was more than just an American 
effort that allowed about 20 Americans, who fled Iraqi troops during the Aug. 2 
invasion, and his embassy staff to survive. He mentioned Europeans and 
Canadians but did not detail their actions. 
</P>
<P>
The embassy staff, trapped inside the U.S. compound without electricity and tap 
water for almost four months, reportedly survived on canned tuna and boiled 
water from the compound's swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Howell said he and his staff were proud to have stayed and overseen more than a 
dozen flights of American citizens from Iraq and Kuwait. Earlier this week, 
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said 2,520 Americans had been 
evacuated in 13 flights since Aug. 2; 200 more Americans escaped from Iraq and 
600 from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
No more flights are planned, since all Americans who want to leave have been 
given the chance and commercial flights have resumed to Amman, Jordan. The 
State Department estimates that about 500 U.S. citizens remain in Kuwait and 
Iraq by their own choice. That figure includes 294 children, 100 women and 115 
men with dual citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
Howell concluded by addressing Baker and saying: "As you pointed out, our 
ordeal is over, but the ordeal of the Kuwaitis and the problems created by the 
war begun in August, which we all would prefer to be solved peacefully, still 
persist in Kuwait. The people of Kuwait must be free."

LATINO ACTIVISTS URGE AMNESTY CHANGES

Penalties against employers who hire illegal immigrants are "unlikely" to stop 
individuals from sneaking across the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a report 
released Friday by a Latino rights organization attempting to repeal employer 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
In its report, "Unfinished Business: The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 
1986," the National Council of La Raza estimated that as many as 4.78 million 
persons were illegally living in the United States in 1990, up from an 
estimated maximum of 3.26 million in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to providing penalties against employers who hire illegal 
immigrants, the 1986 law provided amnesty for illegal immigrants who had been 
in the United States since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The report called on Congress and the Bush Administration to aggressively 
complete the on-going amnesty program. Some 1.7 million illegal immigrants have 
become legal residents under the first stage of the program, but many don't 
adequately understand the provisions of the second stage that brings 
citizenship, La Raza said. 
</P>
<P>
A controversial recommendation included in the report called on Congress to 
consider developing a second amnesty program for persons who have entered the 
country since the 1982 cutoff. "Such means could include a program which 
legalizes individuals living in the United States when (the immigration act) 
was passed, or a second legalization program with a cutoff date that falls 
within one year of enactment," the report suggested. 
</P>
<P>
That idea drew sharp and immediate rebuke from the Federation for American 
Immigration Reform. FAIR objected to the initial amnesty provisions in the 1986 
law and fought unsuccessfully against provisions in the 1990 law that raise the 
level of legal immigration and increase the number of visas for Irish 
immigrants currently living without authorization in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
"With the ink not yet dry on the Immigration Act of 1990 -- a major amnesty 
bill that was pushed by Hispanic advocacy groups in Washington -- the National 
Council of La Raza is already demanding more amnesties and higher numbers," 
FAIR complained in a news release distributed at the La Raza news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"La Raza may be the worst example of special interests politics in America 
today," it concluded. 
</P>
<P>
La Raza's 70-page report, the first comprehensive look at the immigration 
reform law by a Latino-rights organization, issued the opening salvo in the 
group's efforts to seek repeal of the employer sanctions provisions in the 
upcoming Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Employer sanctions have failed to discourage illegal immigrants from entering 
the United States, the report stated. The act's "fundamental purpose had not 
been achieved. In fact, there are substantial reasons to doubt that its intent 
can ever be achieved through the method chosen by Congress." 
</P>
<P>
Last session, lawmakers sidestepped the issue of employer sanctions while 
enacting a sweeping immigration law that significantly increases legal 
immigration. Key staffers on Capitol Hill and immigration experts across the 
country say it's unlikely enough political support would be mustered to repeal 
employer sanctions next year. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, La Raza President Raul Yzaguirre promised to wage the battle, 
saying repeal is "the number one Hispanic civil rights issue."

'SUICIDE MACHINE' DOCTOR CASE WILL BE DROPPED

<P>
A county prosecutor said Friday he will not appeal the dismissal of a 
first-degree murder charge against a retired pathologist whose "suicide 
machine" was used by an Alzheimer's disease patient to kill herself. 
</P>
<P>
The case against Dr. Jack Kevorkian, of Royal Oak, Mich., was thrown out 
Thursday by Oakland County District Judge Gerald McNally. 
</P>
<P>
His ruling followed two days of testimony and the viewing of a dramatic 
videotape in which Janet Adkins told Kevorkian, "I don't want to go on." 
</P>
<P>
Adkins, 54, of Portland, Ore., died June 4 in the back of Kevorkian's van in a 
remote park. She was hooked up to an intravenous device that permitted her to 
inject herself with a lethal solution. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland County prosecutor Richard Thompson said Friday that he will not appeal 
the ruling and that it is time for the Michigan Legislature to eliminate 
confusion over assisting in suicides. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was not conceding that it was legal, but he would not pursue further 
legal action against Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a question preeminently for the legislative branch of 
government," Thompson said, pointing to a movement in the state Senate to make 
assisting in a suicide a felony. 
</P>
<P>
McNally held that Kevorkian committed no crime under state law. He said the 
question of criminality in assisting in a suicide is an issue for the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan Gov.-elect John Engler, reacting to McNally's ruling, said he will 
push for legislation to outlaw helping a person commit suicide. He said he 
hopes the Legislature will act on such a measure early in the 1991 session. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said he will prosecute any other similar cases that occur in Oakland 
County.

BUSH STUDIES RULING AGAINST RACIAL-BASED SCHOLARSHIPS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: BLACK OFFICIAL HAD DECIDED THAT RESERVING FUNDS FOR MINORITIES 
VIOLATES THE LAW. THE ISSUE IS CALLED 'AN OPEN SORE' FOR WHITE HOUSE.

<P>
A mid-level Education Department bureaucrat's ruling against college 
scholarship funds reserved for minorities has plunged the Bush Administration 
once more into confusion over the politically charged issue of race, splitting 
the White House over how to respond. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at it right now," President Bush said as he left Friday for a 
weekend at his Camp David retreat. Indeed, the topic has been the subject of 
intensive meetings at the White House since Wednesday's announcement that the 
Education Department now believes that scholarship funds reserved for minority 
students violate federal law. 
</P>
<P>
"People in here regard it as a major problem," said one senior White House 
aide. The issue has become "an open sore," the official said. "We've got to 
deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
More-conservative aides, however, have been urging Bush to go slow, suggesting 
that the department's ruling, which officials unanimously insist caught Bush 
and his top aides by surprise, merely follows the Administration's policy of 
opposing preferences based on race. 
</P>
<P>
White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray and other officials are expected to review 
the issue over the weekend, and Administration aides said they expect Bush will 
decide next week whether to get directly involved in the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Bush will be trying to select a new head of the Education 
Department to replace Lauro F. Cavazos, whom Bush forced out of office earlier 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
With students and schools across the country uncertain over how the new ruling 
will affect them, the case underlines the volatility of racial issues at a time 
when many Republican strategists are advising Bush to use opposition to 
affirmative action as a leading issue in the 1992 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The scholarship controversy also illustrates another problem -- how easily an 
Administration, even one as tightly centralized as Bush's, can be drawn into 
political difficulty by any one of hundreds of otherwise anonymous officials 
with authority over small parts of the far-spread federal establishment. 
</P>
<P>
In his remarks Friday, Bush indicated that only earlier in the day had he 
learned the background of the decision-maker in this case, Michael L. Williams, 
the Education Department's assistant secretary for civil rights. And he 
expressed apparent relief at his discovery that the 37-year-old conservative 
University of Southern California law school graduate is black. "I don't think, 
in this case, anybody could accuse" Williams of acting "on a racist basis. 
That's one thing I'm very pleased about," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
That is about all anyone at the White House was pleased about in the situation, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
Williams apparently has been considering this issue for months, since the 
Washington Legal Foundation, a conservative legal group here, filed a complaint 
urging him to investigate racially exclusive scholarships. But, White House 
aides insist, neither Williams nor anyone else informed Bush, Chief of Staff 
John H. Sununu or other top White House staffers about the question. "Sununu 
read about it in the news summary," one aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's aides are particularly sensitive about the question because they spent 
much of the fall in a bitter fight over civil rights leading up to Bush's veto 
of a bill to strengthen civil rights laws. And both Bush and his wife, Barbara, 
have devoted considerable energy to raising scholarship funds for minority 
students in the past, lending a personal immediacy to the controversy that 
other domestic policy issues often lack for the President. 
</P>
<P>
Education groups, for their part, are upset that the new policy was simply 
announced in a press conference Wednesday with no written regulations or other 
official policy that would help school officials know what they are now 
supposed to do. 
</P>
<P>
"What are we dealing with?" asked Sheldon Steinbach of the American Council on 
Education, which has taken the lead in organizing a response from educational 
institutions. "This is government by press release." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, although the ruling has caused widespread concern on campuses 
nationwide, Williams' announcement has no binding legal effect. To give his 
opinion the force of law, the department would either have to propose 
regulations or find a school with a race-based scholarship program and bring a 
legal challenge against it. In either case, the process -- which presumably 
would include the threat of withholding federal funds -- would take months. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Washington-based education organizations are advising their 
members to sit tight and leave their current programs in place. 
</P>
<P>
Additional confusion has been caused by the fact that no one either in the 
government or among the education groups appears to know how many scholarships 
might actually be affected by Williams' position. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the foggiest idea," Steinbach said. Most scholarship funds across 
the nation have no racial restrictions, he noted, but "almost every major 
institution in the country has some" funds that were donated specifically to 
benefit minorities. In addition, some institutions have funds specifically for 
women, or men or people from a specific religious or ethnic group, all of which 
might now be subject to challenge. 
</P>
<P>
Until this week, Education Department officials routinely had approved such 
scholarships. If a college had, for example, a dozen scholarships reserved for 
minority-group members out of an overall sum that provided scholarships to 100 
or more students, "that's not been a problem," said Washington attorney David 
Tatel, the Education Department's civil rights chief during the Jimmy Carter 
Administration. Under that sort of situation, "there's no discrimination. 
Minorities and non-minorities can both get scholarships," Tatel said.

OZONE HOLE CLOSING LATE THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF ANTARCTIC WIND PATTERNS

With spring arriving in the Southern Hemisphere, the Antarctic ozone hole is 
closing for the season, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
scientists reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The hole is filling in late this year, said Samuel B. Oltmans of the agency's 
Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
The delay was caused by a circle of persistent winds surrounding the Antarctic 
continent, which prevented air there from mixing with the atmosphere from other 
regions, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency reported that ozone levels over Antarctica climbed to 220 dobson 
units on Dec. 6 and to 270 units by Dec. 10, according to measurements made by 
instruments carried aloft by balloons. Ozone over the South Pole reached a low 
of 130 dobson units in early October, only marginally above the record low 
measured in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
That thinning of the layer is sometimes referred to as a hole, although it 
amounts to somewhat less than half of the normal ozone level of over 300 units 
in that part of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone is vital in the upper atmosphere, where it blocks some of the hazardous 
ultraviolet radiation from the sun. A reduction in ozone could lead to damage 
to crops and animal life and to an increase in skin cancer among humans, some 
scientists warn. 
</P>
<P>
The dobson unit is a measurement of ozone made by comparing how much of each of 
two wavelengths of sunlight is absorbed by the air. That ratio changes 
depending on the concentration of ozone.

SUSPECT IN MURDERS OF MAN, WIFE ARRESTED;

CRIME: NEILL MATZEN, WHO CONFESSED TO THE SLAYINGS IN A LETTER TO A NEWSPAPER 
AND VOWED TO KILL HIMSELF, IS DISCOVERED IN A FONTANA SHACK.

The latest twist in a bizarre murder triangle occurred Friday with the capture 
of a tow-truck driver who confessed in a letter to a newspaper that he was paid 
to kill a friend's wife, killed the friend in self-defense, then vowed to kill 
himself in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Neill F. Matzen, 36, of Santa Ana was arrested at 11 a.m. in a squalid Fontana 
shack on a warrant charging him with the Nov. 24 murder of Donna Connaty, who 
was beaten to death with a lead pipe in her Buena Park home. 
</P>
<P>
His blond hair matted and his clothes filthy from spending two nights in a 
storm drain, Matzen did not resist capture, Buena Park Police Lt. Terry Branum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Matzen had "befriended someone in the storm drain who told him how he could 
make money selling scrap metal," Branum said. Matzen, who moved from the sewer 
to a shack Thursday, deposited some copper wiring at the scrap shop in the 
16000 block of Miller Street. The proprietor required him to show 
identification and recognized Matzen's picture from newspaper and television 
reports of his disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
He then called Riverside County authorities, who notified Buena Park police. 
They apprehended Matzen at 11 a.m. Friday in the lean-to, located near the 
scrap shop. 
</P>
<P>
During a two-hour interview in which police say he waived his rights, Matzen 
allegedly gave police a story of the Connaty deaths that matched the story 
offered in letters to police and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Later Friday, Matzen was housed at Orange County Jail, where he was held 
without bail until his arraignment next week in North Orange County Municipal 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
Filled with allegations of trailer-park adultery and murder-for-hire, the 
bizarre case first unfolded last month in Buena Park with the slaying of Donna 
Connaty, a nurse at St. Joseph's Hospital in Orange who was estranged from her 
husband, Richard. 
</P>
<P>
She had charged her husband in court papers with abusing her and their three 
children. As a result, Richard Connaty moved from their home to a Santa Ana 
mobile home park, where his next-door neighbors were Neill and Cynthia R. 
Matzen. Donna Connaty visited and at some point gave Cynthia Matzen a dog, 
which later bit Matzen's daughter. The Matzens then sued Donna Connaty. The 
events created bad feelings among the foursome, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In Neill Matzen's letter to the newspaper, dated Dec. 7, he admitted beating 
Donna Connaty to death in exchange for a promised $15,000 payment from her 
husband, who was to get the money by refinancing the couple's house. Richard 
Connaty was killed by Matzen on Dec. 3, after he ran into Matzen's Santa Ana 
mobile home, shouted "You killed my wife," and shot Matzen in the left 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Matzen then grabbed his pistol and shot Connaty squarely in the chest. Matzen 
said in the letter to the Orange County Register that the shoot-out occurred 
after he told Richard Connaty that he would no longer permit him to have an 
affair with Matzen's wife. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested for a brief time last week on suspicion of killing Richard Connaty, 
Matzen was released from the jail ward of Western Medical Center in Anaheim 
after the Orange County district attorney's office ruled that he shot Richard 
Connaty in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
After the suicide and confession letters were received, Matzen was the subject 
of a two-day dragnet in the remote Chiriaco Summit area of Riverside County, 
where he had said his body could be found. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Marcida Dodson and correspondent Jon Nalick also contributed 
to this story.

ILLEGAL DUMPING RILES THRIFT STORE OWNERS; 
</P>
<P>
VENTURA: MORE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THEIR GARBAGE BEHIND THE SHOPS AFTER-HOURS. 
HIGHER TRASH-COLLECTION FEES ARE BLAMED.

<P>
The alleyways and dumpsters behind the thrift stores of downtown Ventura are 
fast becoming the unofficial town garbage dump, merchants complain. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city's thrift store managers have always had problems with people 
depositing garbage behind their stores after-hours, they say the problem has 
escalated in the past five months. 
</P>
<P>
Store managers attribute the increase in illegal dumping in the alleys of the 
Main Street area to new city trash-collection rates that have increased garbage 
bills for many residents. 
</P>
<P>
"People pull in and dump," Christine Valdivia, assistant manager for the San 
Buenaventura Mission thrift shop, said. "We come back in the morning, and it's 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Fender, code enforcement specialist for the city, said his office has 
received calls from the public about the illegal dumping, but added there is 
little officials can do to prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
There have always been people who considered the thrift stores a more 
convenient and cheaper dump site than the Bailard Landfill for their unusable 
couches, chairs, refrigerators, washers and dryers, merchants say. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard area landfill generally requires a $15 entrance fee for small loads. 
</P>
<P>
These days the supply of garbage seems never-ending to thrift store managers. 
Their back lots have become cluttered with household trash, including open 
cans, old vegetables, leftover dinners and lawn clippings. 
</P>
<P>
"We get paints, jugs filled with oil. You name it, we've had it," Craig Specht, 
supervisor of the Retarded Children's Thrift Store, said. 
</P>
<P>
The thrift stores end up paying for the disposal of the trash -- hauling the 
junk away twice a week and sometimes even making daily trips to the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just a pain," Monica Carreno, assistant manager for the Goodwill 
Industries Store, said. "I am sure it does cut into our budget, and I am sure 
no one even notices." 
</P>
<P>
Store managers have tried various methods to combat the dumping -- from putting 
up "No Dumping" signs to contacting the police. Nothing seems to work. 
</P>
<P>
"We had the police out to take a written report, but they said there was 
nothing they can do except catch them in the act," Cliff Ward, manager of the 
Retarded Children's store, said. Hiring a guard to watch the area after closing 
is too expensive, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Some merchants are considering fencing off their back lots. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is closed in, and the fence is eight feet high, I don't think they can 
do it," said George Rauch, a handyman at the San Buenaventura Mission Thrift 
Shop. 
</P>
<P>
He added that barbed wire might also deter illegal dumpers. 
</P>

People who dump garbage in other people's trash bins without permission are 
subject to a penalty of up to $250 if caught by city inspectors. They also face 
possible arrest and maximum penalties of $1,000 fines and six months in jail, 
Terry Adelman, the city's director of finance, said. 
</P>
<P>
While expressing concern about the rise in dumping, Ventura officials said they 
believe the problem will probably diminish as people get used to the city's 
higher garbage rates. 
</P>
<P>
Thrift store operators, however, are considerably less optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
Illegal dumping simply goes with the territory for a thrift store business, 
said Richard Dreibeleis, supervisor of the Salvation Army thrift stores in the 
Ventura and Santa Barbara county area. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a fact of life," he said. "That is the nature of the thrift store 
business. . . . Occasionally, a person is going to come by at night and drop 
something off."

TEACHING THEM A LESSON; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN STUDENTS GET SUSPENDED, THEY GO TO CLASS

<P>
It seemed a simple case of showing off when the 14-year-old Ocean View Junior 
High School student pulled out a hunting knife and flashed it in front of his 
friends last year on the playground of the Oxnard school. 
</P>
<P>
But before he could put away the nearly 6-inch-long knife, school authorities 
discovered he had the weapon on campus. The infraction -- a violation of state 
law -- could have led to an immediate expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Because his school record was relatively unblemished, school officials 
consulted with the boy's parents and asked the district superintendent to let 
him stay in school -- but not in regular classes, Principal Frank Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he was sentenced to 10 weeks in Ocean View's in-school suspension 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make sure that he and his parents both knew that this was a real 
dangerous situation," Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
State law provides clear grounds for disciplining students, including 
suspension or expulsion for threatening or physically harming another person at 
school, selling drugs, robbery and damaging school property. 
</P>
<P>
But for problems deemed less serious, ranging from unruliness in the classroom 
to habitual tardiness, Ventura County school districts and individual schools 
use varied techniques to get students on the right track. 
</P>
<P>
At Ocean View, for example, instead of being sent home -- a break some students 
may view as a welcome vacation from school -- suspended students are sent to 
teacher David Moore's class, either for the 10-week independent guidance 
program for serious infractions, or to serve time for two- or three-day 
suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
Several other districts in Ventura County have similar programs, including the 
Oxnard Union High School District and Simi Valley Unified. 
</P>
<P>
"In-school suspension is in lieu of booting kids out of school, which is the 
craziest thing I ever heard," Moore said. "Oftentimes in the past, a kid who 
cuts school gets suspended out of school, if you can figure that. So we're 
eliminating that." 
</P>
<P>
Moore's class ranges from six to 12 students throughout the year. Instead of 
changing classes over the course of a six-hour day, they remain in the same 
room for four hours straight, with short bathroom and lunch breaks. They are 
bused home at 12:20 p.m. Students must accumulate 50 "perfect" days, with 
regular attendance and good behavior, to earn the right to return to regular 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, a teacher for 25 years, said the program removes troublemakers from 
class and allows teachers to be more effective with other students. 
</P>
<P>
"Regular classroom teachers will maybe spend up to 20% to 30% of their time 
with kids who are causing a lot of heartaches," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Having the program on-campus has proved an advantage, because administrators 
can send errant students there for short suspensions of two to three days or 
for just one school period. 
</P>
<P>
"Some teachers and kids just do not get along. It's a personality thing," Moore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure that a student is not sentenced unfairly to the program, at least 
four of a student's six teachers must agree that he should be in the program. 
Parents, who generally would already have been informed of a child's behavioral 
problems, are advised of the recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
One eighth-grade student said he landed in Moore's class for 10 weeks because 
he argued with two students, cursed a teacher who asked him to remove his hat 
during class and was caught ditching classes. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hotheaded," said the 13-year-old, whose name is being withheld at school 
officials' request. He said he was frustrated by having to stay all day in 
Moore's classroom, despite its wall-to-wall colorful decorations. But since 
he's been there, he said, his grades have improved from Cs and Ds to mostly Bs. 
</P>
<P>
Friday was the student's 50th and final day in Moore's class. On Monday, he 
will return full-time to a regular schedule. If his problems recur, he may be 
put in an independent study program, requiring him to check in with Moore once 
a week to receive assignments to complete at home. He would then be given a 
final chance in a regular classroom. 
</P>
<P>
If the problems persist, under the school's policy he could be expelled. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Channel Islands High in Oxnard started a similar suspension center, 
a pilot program in the six-school Oxnard Union High School District, Dean of 
Students James Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
And both the Oxnard district and the Conejo Valley Unified School District have 
Saturday work-study programs, requiring students who have been reprimanded to 
spend two hours cleaning on the campus and another two hours studying, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Many schools have a progressive system for dealing with students who misbehave. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pleasant Valley Elementary School District, for example, discipline 
starts with a verbal warning from the teacher to the student, Assistant Supt. 
Erich Anders said. Continuing problems lead to conferences with the student's 
parents and ultimately with administrators, who decide what action should be 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
Often, schools have student study teams, groups of teachers, administrators, 
school psychologists, counselors and other staff members who review the records 
of problem students and decide whether they should be placed in special 
programs. Parents are also asked to attend to discuss their child's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Corporal punishment in schools was outlawed statewide when Gov. George 
Deukmejian signed a bill that went into effect in 1987, barring teachers and 
other school employees from spanking youngsters, even if the school has written 
parental permission. Many school districts had already banned the practice 
before the law was signed. 
</P>
<P>
Expulsions, usually recommended by a school principal after consultation with 
teachers and other staff, require school board approval and are usually decided 
in closed meetings. Students are usually expelled for the remainder of the 
semester and one additional semester. 
</P>
<P>
But expulsions are the last resort and are rare in many county school 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
The Ocean View School District in Oxnard, for example, has not expelled any 
students in four years, said Supt. Robert Allen, although 52 students were 
suspended last year for a variety of infractions. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Smidt, superintendent of the 3,400-student Ojai Unified School District, 
could recall only two student expulsions in the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
Expulsions become more common at the high school level, as problems with 
weapons and drugs on campus increase. Several county districts reported slight 
increases in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Expulsions in the Conejo Valley, for example, averaged about 10 a year until 
the figure jumped to 17 in 1988-89, and then to 23 last year, Simpson said. One 
reason for last year's high figure was the expulsion of six students involved 
in a pipe bomb incident at Newbury Park High, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Oxnard Union High School District, 19 students were expelled last year, 
and eight have been expelled so far this year, said Christine Smith, director 
of student services. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley's Assistant Supt. Allan Jacobs said there have been two expulsions 
in the district so far, "almost in every instance" related to a weapon either 
used in a fight or in a student's possession. 
</P>
<P>
Helping students understand the consequences of acts such as bringing drugs or 
weapons on campus may bring such figures down, some officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the whole goal of the program," said Edwards, the Channel Islands High 
dean. "It changes student behavior."

DRIVER GETS 10 YEARS IN DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Camarillo man with a criminal and drug-abuse record dating back to his 
teen-age years was sentenced to 10 years in state prison Friday for the 
hit-and-run death of a Simi Valley city official who was killed while riding 
his bicycle in June. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence was imposed by Judge Lawrence Storch as a dozen friends and 
relatives of Steven Sugimoto listened silently and brushed away tears in 
Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Oseguera, 28, also listened with head bowed throughout most of the 
proceedings. Oseguera pleaded guilty in October to charges of gross vehicular 
manslaughter while intoxicated and felony hit-and-run in the accident that 
killed Sugimoto as he was bicycling west of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Sugimoto, 28, was assistant Simi Valley city planner. His brother, Michael, 
said after the sentencing that he was pleased by the length of the sentence, 
adding: "We're happy for every day we keep him off the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Michael Sugimoto had personally appealed to the judge for a stiff 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents are still in shock at Steven's death," he said, speaking in a low 
voice that sometimes broke. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Sugimoto also showed Storch photographs of his brother, and of a 
memorial placed at his grave by co-workers. He described a caring man who had 
wanted to marry and have children. Steven Sugimoto had been the best man at a 
friend's wedding only a day before the accident, his brother added. 
</P>
<P>
His brother loved to cycle and had won several cycling competitions, Sugimoto 
told the court. 
</P>
<P>
Oseguera was on parole for a felony hit-and-run, auto theft and burglary at the 
time of the accident and has a criminal record dating back to age 16, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kim George Gibbons, who prosecuted the case. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbons had asked Storch to impose the maximum 12-year sentence in the case, 
but Deputy Public Defender William McGuffey asked for a lighter term, saying 
Oseguera had expressed remorse for his actions and is aware that he will have 
to carry the burden of the accident for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
Storch acknowledged the loss of a "dynamic young person" as he weighed the 
decision, but decided against sentencing Oseguera to the maximum term. He said 
he took into consideration the fact that Oseguera pleaded guilty and "spared 
the family and taxpayers the agony and expense of a court trial." 
</P>
<P>
Steven Sugimoto was bicycling west along the paved shoulder of California 118 
about 4:15 p.m. June 10 when Oseguera approached from the rear in a 1979 
Oldsmobile Cutlass, said Gibbons. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told investigators that Oseguera was speeding and passing cars on the 
right when he hit Sugimoto, throwing him to the ground, Gibbons said. Sugimoto 
suffered massive head and internal injuries and died later at Pleasant Valley 
Hospital, Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
Oseguera sped away after the accident, and police chased him for 5 1/2 miles to 
Lewis Road in Somis, when the owner of the car, 30-year-old David Rojas of 
Oxnard, grabbed the wheel and asked Oseguera to stop, Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
Tests taken nearly two hours afterward showed that Oseguera had a blood-alcohol 
content of 0.17%, more than twice the legal 0.08% limit, Gibbons said. But he 
said there was no evidence Oseguera had used drugs, despite his admission to 
police that he had injected heroin an hour before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Oseguera will be eligible for parole in four years, said Gibbons, who added 
that he was happy with the judge's decision.

COUNTY MAPS WAR AGAINST SMOKING; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: OFFICIALS PLAN TO USE A SHARE OF REVENUES FROM THE 25-CENT-PER-PACK 
CIGARETTE TAX TO MAKE THE ANTI-TOBACCO MESSAGE INESCAPABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ventura County officials plan to spend almost $1 million in state funds during 
the next two years on an anti-smoking blitz that goes beyond simply spreading 
the word. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which comes before the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, includes a 
number of possible tactics -- everything from urging the Ventura County Fair's 
rodeo officials to drop their tobacco sponsor to asking doctors to write "quit 
smoking" prescriptions for their patients. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for asking newspapers to stop accepting tobacco 
advertising, using billboards to counteract tobacco advertising and coaching 
health and education professionals on the dangers of smoking and how to help 
smokers quit. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to make the message inescapable," said Carlene Maggio, a senior 
health educator with the Ventura County Tobacco Education and Control Program. 
Consumers "are already being saturated by information from the tobacco 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the program comes from a 25-cent tax on cigarettes that voters 
statewide approved in 1988 as part of Proposition 99. The tax took effect Jan. 
1, 1989, and is expected to generate $1.46 billion by mid-1991. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, local program officials will ask the supervisors to approve 
submitting the plan to the state Department of Health Services for any final 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the tax measure is to reduce the consumption of tobacco by 75% in 
California by the year 2000. Current estimates show that about 30% of the adult 
population smokes, said Bill Miley, the county's program coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Miley is the first to admit that the program's anti-smoking message isn't new. 
The health hazards of tobacco were first publicized broadly in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
"People who smoke underestimate the risk or they intellectualize the risk to 
themselves and those around them," he said. "They say, 'Oh yeah, tobacco and 
smoking cause cancer. You got a cigarette?' " 
</P>
<P>
The program, which has its office at 3160 Telegraph Road in Ventura, opened 
last summer and the seven-member staff has begun offering free counseling to 
smokers who want to quit. But the program's efforts will intensify early next 
month as the plan is implemented. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first efforts will be a countywide survey of tobacco advertising on 
billboards, in newspapers, on bus benches and at local sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
Maggio said the Tobacco Education and Prevention Coalition, a program advisory 
group, is talking with other anti-smoking groups about circulating petitions 
urging the rodeo to drop its chewing tobacco sponsor, the U.S. Tobacco Co., 
which makes Skoal. 
</P>
<P>
The sponsor should be dropped, she said, because it is "selling death and 
sickness." Not only does the company advertise its product, it hands out 
samples during the rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
"The prevalence of smokeless tobacco is on the increase among adolescents," she 
said. Youth look to rodeo stars as heroes and that makes the tobacco more 
attractive to them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Fair contracts with the Flying U Rodeo in Marysville, said 
Mike Paluszak, general manager of the fair. Even if the fair sought a different 
rodeo, it's likely its sponsors would include tobacco companies, Paluszak said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's plan also calls for asking the Ventura County Star-Free Press and 
the Los Angeles Times to drop or reduce their tobacco advertising. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't think we would," said Jeff Young, national sales manager for The 
Times, although he said the decision would be made by the publisher. The 
tobacco companies already are cutting back on their newspaper advertising 
because of public pressure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Spurr, general manager of the Star-Free Press, said "there is not that much 
tobacco advertising anymore." He didn't know if the newspaper would drop the 
advertising if asked. "I'd have to look at what they're asking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's plan also includes its own advertising. Anti-smoking messages 
would go on bus benches. Billboards would go up as close as possible to 
pro-smoking billboards. 
</P>
<P>
A large part of the plan is a massive drive to inform health and education 
professionals about the dangers of tobacco so they can pass the word on to 
students, employees and patients and instruct them on how to quit. 
</P>
<P>
A drive is already under way to encourage doctors to give their patients a 
quit-smoking prescription and a referral to the program's office for counseling 
on how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
An order from a doctor carries more weight with patients, and they are more 
likely to try to quit, said Mary Leu Pappas, a public health nurse with the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"Their physician is saying, 'I care enough about you to prescribe this,' " she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Once in the program's office, smokers who want to quit receive counseling, 
watch videos and have available a mass of information on why they should quit 
and how they can do it. Then they pick a date and sign a contract indicating 
that on that day they promise to quit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
"The first three days are the worst," said Pappas. But they receive tips on how 
to withstand the urge to smoke, such as chewing gum, drinking water and taking 
walks. 
</P>
<P>
Under Proposition 99, the county could offer material incentives worth up to 
$50 to people who quit. But the county has no plans at this time to do that, 
other than possibly giving away T-shirts, Miley said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's plan includes a number of other anti-smoking efforts such as 
developing a speakers bureau and a clearinghouse of information and encouraging 
smoke-free policies for doctors, hospitals, dentists, schools and businesses.

A Chumash Indian complex proposed for a Thousand Oaks park will have no adverse 
impact on the environment, according to a study which has been sent to the 
County Board of Supervisors for final approval Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
If the study is approved, the county will finalize architectural drawings and 
open bidding on the project. 
</P>
<P>
The complex planned for 25 acres in Oakbrook Regional Park would include a 
4,200-square-foot visitor center and Chumash museum, a half-mile educational 
trail and a replica of a Chumash village. 
</P>
<P>
All 423 acres of Oakbrook Regional Park, an area believed to have been 
frequented by the Chumash, have been closed to the public since the county 
acquired it in 1981 to preserve the American Indian heritage of the area. 
Opening the proposed 25-acre complex is not expected to jeopardize the rest of 
the park, said Ron Blakemore, planning and development manager for Ventura 
County Recreation Services. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Chumash complex will cost about $1 million, Blakemore said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Thousand Oaks City Council has unanimously chosen four new planning 
commissioners out of a field of 54 candidates who applied for the positions. 
</P>
<P>
The appointees to the five-member planning board are: Marilyn Carpenter, 55, a 
former Ventura County planning commissioner; Forrest Frields, 48, a member of 
the citizen's traffic committee; Mervyn Kopp, 56, a mortgage broker with Camden 
Financial Services; and Irv Wasserman, 69, former president of the Thousand 
Oaks Council on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in the city's 26-year history that a majority of the 
commission is made up of newcomers. Commissioner Andrew Fox has one year of 
experience on the planning board.

FACES . . .: ROLE IN 'PARADISE' HELPS TOMITA TRACE HER CULTURAL ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Starring in the new Alan Parker Film "Come See the Paradise" gave Tamlyn Tomita 
something few roles ever offer: the chance to explore her own history. 
</P>
<P>
The film, which opens Dec. 23, explores the lives of a Japanese-American family 
in a World War II internment camp. 
</P>
<P>
It also gave Tomita a firsthand look at what her late father experienced as a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
"He remembered living in the desert with huge mountains around him and a 
barbed-wire fence," says the actress, who plays the independent oldest daughter 
of an immigrant businessman. "One of his most vivid memories was playing 
marbles and having to retrieve them from under the fence. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Japanese-Americans have that legacy. The camp experience is something of 
a calling card between them. They say, 'So, where were you interned?' " 
</P>
<P>
A former UCLA mass communication/history student, Tomita had a "very 
Cinderella-ish" introduction to her present career. She won the title of 1984 
Nisei Week Queen at the annual L.A. Japanese festival. Through the contest, she 
met a woman who was helping out the casting director of "The Karate Kid, Part 
II." Tomita went to a casting call to satisfy her curiosity -- and walked out 
with the role of Ralph Macchio's girlfriend. "I guess they found something 
quirky in me." 
</P>
<P>
Of her current part, Tomita says: "It's so incredible -- not just a great 
Asian-American role, not just a great woman's role." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her appreciation of her own cultural background, Tomita encountered 
culture shock on her first visit to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so foreign to me. The only reason I even learned Japanese was to figure 
out what my parents were getting me for Christmas." LAUREN LIPTON

FACES . . .: SCHOEFFLING CARVES OUT A NICHE AWAY FROM THE MOVIE SET 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Schoeffling, co-starring in "Mermaids" as a mysterious convent 
caretaker who captures Winona Ryder's teen-age fancy, may never have to stand 
in the unemployment line. Between such film assignments as "Sixteen Candles," 
"Belizaire the Cajun" and "Longtime Companion," the 30-year-old actor has a 
successful furniture-making business at his home near Wilkes-Barre, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
"Actors spend most of their time out of work, so I actually spend more time 
making furniture," he says. "The thing about furniture that's much better than 
acting is that it's just me. There's no director, no script -- the concept is 
me, unless a client wants something. In film work you do the best you can under 
the given circumstances, but you don't have control. At least, I don't." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Schoeffling particularly aspires to attaining the kind of stardom that 
commands on-set omnipotence. He prefers living with his wife and two young 
children in his native state because there he "can afford to live like a king, 
and there's a change of seasons. You do miss stuff (not being in Los Angeles), 
but it's worth it. How much money do you need? How many parts do you need?" 
</P>
<P>
Schoeffling's own acting needs surfaced after he left college after a year on 
the wrestling team, and spent the following two years exploring Europe and 
North Africa, working as a cook. Upon his return, he moved to New York, where 
he met an agent through his actor-roommates and landed a role in "Racing With 
the Moon." Cut from the film, his official screen debut came opposite Molly 
Ringwald in "Sixteen Candles." 
</P>
<P>
Next up for Schoeffling is the spring release of the drama "Wild Hearts Can't 
Be Broken," in which he plays Cliff Robertson's rebellious son. 
</P>
<P>
Has he any other plans?

POP BEAT LASER BIN: PIONEER HAS AMBITIONS FOR MADONNA CONCERT DISC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can Madonna sell laser-disc players as well as she sells herself? 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer Artists, the nation's leading distributor of music-related laser discs, 
hopes so. 
</P>
<P>
In a move virtually unprecedented in the video industry, Pioneer has just 
released Madonna's "Blond Ambition World Tour Live" exclusively on laser disc. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, video packages of this nature are released on videocassette two to 
six weeks before they are released on laser disc. In this case, however, "Blond 
Ambition" won't be released on videocassette for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Galloway, president of Pioneer Artists, said he hopes the fact that an 
artist of Madonna's stature would release a video only on laser disc will send 
a signal to millions of potential laser customers that the new format has 
finally come of age. 
</P>
<P>
Because laser discs offer substantially better picture and sound quality than 
videocassettes, there have been predictions for years that laser discs will 
eventually capture a large share of the prerecorded video market, much the way 
that its sister format the compact disc has become a major force in the album 
market. But it hasn't happened yet. 
</P>
<P>
Though the price of laser players has fallen dramatically in recent years (now 
less than $400 in some combination models that play CDs and lasers), there are 
still fewer than 500,000 players in homes around the country -- a statistic 
that has left laser manufacturers understandably frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the public's slowness to move into laser-disc players is that, 
unlike videocassette machines, you cannot yet make your own laser recordings 
with home laser equipment. Still, it is so much more fun to watch a movie or 
music program, such as "Blond Ambition," on laser disc that almost everyone 
exposed to the format becomes a salesperson for it. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, these converts hold on to their VCRs to record programs off 
television the same way pop fans keep their tape decks for specialized uses 
even after they've begun buying most of their new albums on compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
Galloway said that the laser exclusive with Madonna grew out of an agreement 
last spring for Pioneer, the electronics hardware and software giant, to 
sponsor her tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I contacted her manager, Freddy DeMann, long before the tour started in hopes 
of getting the laser-disc rights to any video that was going to be shot in 
association with the tour," Galloway said. DeMann was meeting with potential 
corporate sponsors at the time, Galloway said, and he asked if Pioneer would be 
interested in sponsoring the tour. The company apparently jumped at the 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"Madonna is the ideal artist to reach the new demographics that we are hoping 
to attract with the new, low-priced combination CD and laser players . . . the 
young, hip 18-35 audience," Galloway said. 
</P>
<P>
"Until these low-priced players arrived, laser discs were considered something 
just for the high-end market . . . a rich man's toy. But that has changed and 
Madonna seemed the ideal artist to drive that point home." 
</P>
<P>
And what about the "Blond Ambition" package itself? 
</P>
<P>
The video is based on the same concert in Nice that HBO broadcast live last 
summer, but the new, edited laser version offers much more of the vitality and 
charm of the show itself than the HBO special. 
</P>
<P>
At just $29.95 for a two-hour concert program, the laser disc is also a much 
better buy than the five-minute "Justify My Love," the much-ado-about-nothing 
video single that sells for $9.98. 
</P>
<P>
It's still hard to believe that a program as distinguished as "Nightline" would 
devote an entire half-hour to showing the video and asking Madonna the same 
question 22 different ways: "Haven't you finally gone too far?" 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing in "Blond Ambition" that is likely to earn the singer a return 
appearance on "Nightline" -- though it is interesting to see how the mock 
masturbation sequence during "Like a Virgin" appears to have been a model for 
the bedroom fantasies outlined in "Justify My Love." 
</P>
<P>
What "Blond Ambition" does, however, is show that Madonna isn't just a 
masterful pop strategist. She's also someone with considerable imagination and 
talent. She's not a great singer or writer, but she infuses her music and her 
concerts with a sense of personality, spirit and, yes, ideas. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the sequences in "Blond Ambition" are silly and self-conscious, but 
most are witty and engaging, making it an especially winning package.

EDWIN LESTER: A BENEVOLENT RULER OF MUSICAL THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The age of chivalry in the arts may well have ended Thursday with the death of 
Edwin Lester. Not only was Lester, 95, the founder of the Los Angeles Civic 
Light Opera and the undisputed prince of musical theater in this city, but he 
was a man universally respected for the classy way in which he conducted his 
business and his life. 
</P>
<P>
Like the organization he ran for almost 40 years -- a phenomenally successful 
commercial musical venture -- Edwin Lester was always slightly larger than 
life, more grand opera than operetta, but with a sense of humor that tempered 
the grandiloquence and a keenness of mind that stayed with him until the very 
last days. 
</P>
<P>
He brought musical theater to Los Angeles in the mid-1930s and remained its 
reigning monarch until his self-appointed retirement in the late '70s -- an 
empirical, benevolent ruler who ran his domain with the ironclad ethics and 
impeccable manners that earned him respect, even from those -- perhaps 
especially from those -- who did not necessarily share his musical tastes. 
</P>
<P>
"He lived his theater, the Civic Light Opera was his mistress," said singer 
Patricia Morison, who had auditioned for him as a young woman. "Musical theater 
was fun when he did it. He employed people in this town. He gave young people 
breaks. He could be old-fashioned and opinionated but also very loyal." 
</P>
<P>
Loyalty was a hallmark. A gentleman of the old school, Lester got as good as he 
gave. He was surrounded most of his life by stalwart associates, such as 
Eleanor Pinkham and his longtime secretary, Joan Gilmore, who were as devoted 
to him as they were to his causes. But Lester, who could be surprisingly 
high-handed in his unquestioned self-assurance, paradoxically never let success 
spoil him. He was a hands-on producer who personally answered all his mail and 
had absolute regard for his subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Musical tastes were another matter. His were often questioned and did not 
change with the changing times. He made no secret of preferring operettas and 
"book musicals with happy endings." He believed the test of time to be the only 
true measure of successful musical writing and was no fan of the new style of 
musicals ushered in by Stephen Sondheim. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't stop him from respecting what others saw in Sondheim and bringing 
"Company" (1971) and "Pacific Overtures" (1976) to the CLO. 
</P>
<P>
When "Cabaret" -- considered racy for his audience -- had come to CLO in the 
late '60s, Lester had acknowledged it was not his kind of show but that he 
respected it, adding that he would have made some changes had it been up to 
him. What changes? Well, instead of those buxom German dancers, he would have 
substituted svelte and beautiful women -- precisely what "Cabaret" was not 
about. 
</P>
<P>
After he had ceded the reins, LACLO was never the same. But Lester either never 
let its decline bother him or never admitted that it did. As far as he was 
concerned, the Edwin Lester Civic Light Opera began and ended with Edwin 
Lester. What he couldn't help or couldn't change he would not allow to affect 
him. He never uttered a word of criticism or leveled a single complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Only once, when the LACLO was going through a particularly bad patch at the 
hands of his successors did he venture the opinion that he had perhaps retired 
a little too soon. 
</P>
<P>
As he grew older, and especially after his retirement, he became more and more 
relaxed, engaging and delightful. We maintained a lively correspondence and had 
dinner from time to time. Mostly, my husband and I were his guests. Only once 
were we able to lure him to our home. He clearly preferred it the other way. 
Playing host had become his occupation of choice and he did that too in style. 
</P>
<P>
While he was still at LACLO, he once shipped a box of chocolate-covered 
pretzels to our home for Christmas. Not wanting to seem to curry favor, he 
signed the card with an X. But it wasn't hard to track down the gift-giver and, 
playing along with the mystery, I responded with a thank-you note signed with a 
Y. This became our private joke and annual conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Every year thereafter a box of chocolate-covered pretzels arrived promptly at 
our door for the holidays. They were, he said, his favorite. Christmas won't be 
the same without them.

CATHOLIC THEOLOGIANS CRITICIZE VATICAN'S ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 400 American Roman Catholic theologians charged this week that the 
Vatican has been throttling church reforms and imposing "an excessive Roman 
centralization." 
</P>
<P>
The theologians contended that the Vatican has undercut a greater role for 
women, violated rights of theologians, slowed the ecumenical drive for 
Christian unity and undermined the collegial functioning of national 
conferences of bishops. 
</P>
<P>
The "role of the local churches, of their bishops, and of the bishops' 
conferences is being diminished," the theologians declared in a 2,400-word 
statement drawn up in 1 1/2 years of work. 
</P>
<P>
Sent to all American bishops by the Catholic Theological Society of America, 
the statement was approved by 431 of its 1,400 U.S. and Canadian members, which 
was 79% of a mailed response from 544 who replied. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Walter H. Principe of Toronto, president of the society, said the 
support was greater than if the society had taken the action formally at a 
convention, because fewer than 300 usually attend. 
</P>
<P>
The theologians portrayed recent restrictive moves by the Vatican as failing to 
live up to the reforming vision of the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65. 
</P>
<P>
Issued on the 25th anniversary of the council's close, the theologians noted 
that it invited all Christians to speak out "with that liberty and confidence 
which befits the children of God." 
</P>
<P>
They said Roman officials had put "unprecedented obligations" on theologians, 
such as in a recently prescribed loyalty oath and profession of faith, and by 
treating "public disagreement with official teaching as defiance." 
</P>
<P>
Charging theological "narrowness of consultation" in the Vatican, the 
theologians said questions among them are "cut off prematurely" and different 
levels of teachings "are presented as carrying the same authority." 
</P>
<P>
Procedures of the Vatican's doctrinal congregation, headed by Cardinal Joseph 
Ratzinger, in investigating views of theologians "fail to honor fundamental 
human rights and the safeguards" to protect them, the theologians said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"The 'freedom of inquiry, thought and expression' necessary for serious 
theological scholarship . . . and procedural traditions in our seminaries, 
colleges and universities which protect that freedom, have been called into 
question." 
</P>
<P>
Development of "legitimate public roles for women in the church is being 
neglected," the theologians said. 
</P>
<P>
Although recent bishops' reflection and assignments have recognized a larger 
role for women and brought out the possibility of their ordination, the Vatican 
has firmly cut off such consideration, the theologians said.

MOVIE FANS BUY MEMORIES AT NEW UNIVERSAL SHOP; 
</P>
<P>
MEMORABILIA: LA GALERIE CATERS TO A GROWING NUMBER OF COLLECTORS OF ITEMS FROM 
THE BIG SCREEN AND TV.

Stephen Howard and his wife, Tina, were typical tourists. Like thousands of 
others, they experienced the parting of the Red Sea and the wrath of King Kong 
at Universal Studios Tour. But unlike most, when the Howards left the tram 
ride, they took home a piece of television magic: the original genie bottle 
used in NBC's 1965-70 series "I Dream of Jeannie." 
</P>
<P>
"When we walked into the store, what really impressed us were the unique items 
featured" at La Galerie Hollywood, said Stephen Howard, a 30ish lawyer from 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
La Galerie is Universal's latest addition to the "Streets of the World" section 
of the tour, with restaurants and less expensive gift shops. It is also the 
studio's first attempt to capitalize on cinema history, merchandising classic 
movie memorabilia ranging from postcards, original cigarette and lobby cards, 
to authentic cartoon cels with autographed signatures and costumes worn in 
classic films. 
</P>
<P>
Last year the Howards purchased their first movie collectible -- an autograph 
of Vivien Leigh on her personal stationery. "My wife is a real 'Gone With The 
Wind' fan. And we're drawn to anything that's a one-of-a-kind," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
When the couple noticed the four-colored genie bottle at La Galerie, they 
discussed purchasing it, but eventually decided the $3,495 price was too steep. 
</P>
<P>
"But there was a uniqueness to the piece," said Howard. "It was actually used 
on the show, and the location of the others is presently unknown." Several 
weeks later, Howard couldn't resist. He called Jim Cerone, the store's retail 
buyer, from Texas and became the genie bottle's new master. 
</P>
<P>
"A growing number of young people are discovering the great old movies because 
of the American Movie Classics cable channel," said Patsy Irvine, a 
collectibles specialist for Butterfield &amp; Butterfield, a San 
Francisco-based auction house dealing in movie memorabilia through its Los 
Angeles office. "We see more and more people wanting movie magazines, 
autographed photographs, even the clothing used in filming. And the more 
bizarre something is, the more it's sought after." 
</P>
<P>
The concept for La Galerie developed more than a year ago. Silver Screen, a 
small gift shop on the studio tour, carried a few celebrity autographs, said 
Eileen Strotz, director of merchandising for La Galerie. "But they started 
selling very well, so we knew there was a strong enough interest in this sort 
of memorabilia." La Galerie opened in June, with Silver Screen continuing to 
stock less expensive items, Strotz said. 
</P>
<P>
Strotz and Cerone spent months attending auctions and sorting through 
memorabilia stored in property warehouses on the Universal lot. It took nearly 
12 months to gather and restore items for the opening. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked with experts at Camden Auction House, a Los Angeles company 
specializing in movie collectibles," said Cerone. "In pricing items, it all 
depends whether or not the celebrity is living or dead, whether the item 
carries an authentic autograph, and just how rare the item is. Elvis Presley, 
for example, signed his name on very few things throughout his lifetime, so 
anything with his signature is rare." 
</P>
<P>
La Galerie does display a framed 20th Century Fox contract signed by The King 
and his manager, Col. Tom Parker, Cerone said. The document is dated Dec. 22, 
1958, and sells for $4,300. 
</P>
<P>
Other pricey items include: the autographs of all four Beatles on one card, 
framed with their photograph, selling for $4,300; a promotional scarf given 
away during the premiere of "The Wizard of Oz" for $5,000; and a 1938 edition 
of the novel "Gone With The Wind," autographed by 23 cast and crew members, for 
$30,000. 
</P>
<P>
"People who visit La Galerie seem to be fascinated by anything autographed. I 
guess that's because it's about as close as you can get to these legends," 
Cerone said about the 1,200-square-foot area fashioned like a fine-art museum. 
Since items are constantly being bought and sold, patrons frequently see new 
displays. About 5% of the shop changes monthly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made it just as entertaining to come into the shop and just look," 
Strotz said. "We showcase quite a few fun items from our own studio collections 
that are not for sale." 
</P>
<P>
Items marked "For Your Enjoyment Only" include: the colored mat used as the 
background set for Munchkinland in "The Wizard of Oz"; the silver goblet from 
Kirk Douglas' "Spartacus"; and a hat worn by W.C. Fields. About 20% of La 
Galerie's memorabilia is not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still sorting through the items stored in Universal's warehouse," said 
Strotz. "Cowboy star Tom Mix's saddle is sitting in a huge crate there. So much 
of the material was stored in poor shape for so many years that we've had to do 
a lot of restoration. The miniature battering ram from "Masada" that's 
displayed in the shop window had to be literally pieced back together." 
</P>
<P>
Another popular section at La Galerie displays cels from animated movies and 
television cartoons such as "The Jetsons," "The Flintstones" and "Roger 
Rabbit." Some of the cels cost as much as $6,000, said Strotz, who noted that 
Galerie carries a "Roger Rabbit" cel, autographed by Charles Fleischer, the 
voice of Roger Rabbit. It costs $4,995. 
</P>
<P>
Purchasing movie memorabilia can be exasperating, Cerone said. He recalled when 
he attended a Camden House auction to purchase a script titled "A Boy's Life," 
which would later become the basis for Universal's movie "E.T." The auction 
catalogue estimated its value at $400. But Cerone found himself in a bidding 
war with a private collector. The final price was $8,500. 
</P>
<P>
"We really wanted to have that script. 'E.T.' is a Universal film," said 
Cerone. "But it just goes to show you how bidding can really escalate the price 
you pay for something." 
</P>
<P>
"Movie memorabilia is very different from any other art form. There's an 
emotional value attached to it," said Joshua Arfer, director of animation and 
collectibles for Christie's, a New York City-based auction house. "When people 
see a particular scene from a movie or a character or costume that made them 
laugh or cry, there are a lot of 'oohs and ahs' when they get the chance to buy 
that item. And the majority of collectors make purchases for purely personal 
enjoyment. There are very few dealers in movie memorabilia, even in Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting to get specific requests from guests," said Cerone, noting that 
one Galerie visitor requested an authentic Sammy Davis autograph mounted with 
Davis' photo. But since Galerie is new, most customers are tourists. 
</P>
<P>
However, the distinction between the serious collector and the tourist is a 
fine one. "There will always be people who will immortalize and idolize Elvis, 
Marilyn and James Dean," he said.

DANNY SIMON BRINGS OUT THE COMIC GENIUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. DANIEL FOSTER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: Foster is a regular contributor to 
Valley Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The story is one that Danny Simon had been waiting for all his life. 
</P>
<P>
Two tourists in Europe once approached Simon's brother, Neil, the most 
successful playwright of our time. One of them said: "I beg your pardon, but we 
think we know who you are, but we're not sure. Isn't your name Simon?" Smiling, 
Neil Simon produced a pen for the expected autograph. 
</P>
<P>
The tourist continued: "We thought we recognized you. You're Danny Simon's 
brother, aren't you?" 
</P>
<P>
For a man eternally known as "Neil Simon's brother," the anecdote packs some 
real punch -- even though the tourists were former students in Danny Simon's 
comedy writing classes in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"What I teach is the thought process of comedy," said Simon, who lives in 
Sherman Oaks. "By merely taking my course, you don't become funny. You have to 
be born funny. I just help bring it out -- mold it and shape it." 
</P>
<P>
His first pupil was his younger brother, Neil, who at age 15 collaborated with 
Danny on their first sketch. The pair later formed a partnership and worked for 
nine years for such comedians as Buddy Hackett, Jan Murray, Red Buttons, Jackie 
Gleason and Milton Berle. 
</P>
<P>
Neil split for Broadway, and Danny chose Hollywood, to direct and write for TV 
-- and to bring along yet another great talent named Woody Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, who once said, "Everything, unequivocally, that I learned about comedy 
writing I learned from him," worked for Simon on "The Colgate TV Comedy Hour" 
in the early 1950s. He later went on, as Simon tells it, to make a few movies. 
</P>
<P>
Simon has now settled on a course devoted to bringing out the comic genius in 
others. The phone in his condominium rings with calls from producers and 
writing students whom he matches up, creating new-found careers. During 11 
years, Simon figures he has taught about 4,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
"A teacher always teaches himself," he said, adding that his classes have 
helped him revise his play, "Convertible Girl," first written in 1973 and now 
playing at the Jewish Community Center of Houston. "You begin to realize all 
the things you've been teaching yourself all these years." 
</P>
<P>
Simon teaches an eight-week TV-writing class that is followed by six weeks of 
instruction focusing on writing for theater and film. Continuing classes are 
available after completing the first two levels.

The man had made a monster, evil-looking, crouching, with forked tail and 
claw-like hand. When the clay dried, he painted it black, with red eyes and red 
mouth. Along its side, he made finger-fitting indentations -- he said they 
allowed him to get a grip on it, gave him some control over it. But into its 
claw, he put a tiny representation of himself. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you want to call it?" art therapist Ruth Ross recalls asking him. 
</P>
<P>
"Mother," the man said. 
</P>
<P>
To the therapist, the monster spoke volumes about the roots of the patient's 
present problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Verbally, we're skilled," says Ross, president of the Maryland Art Therapy 
Assn. "We know how to go around and avoid what we don't want the other person 
to know. But we don't know how to cover up with art, so it all hangs out." 
</P>
<P>
In art, people "reveal what they're feeling that they don't consciously know," 
adds art therapist Gail Fenster of Walter Reed Army Medical Center in 
Washington. Fenster has been using art to help AIDS patients express the 
emotional turmoil that comes with the diagnosis, the occurrence of new 
infections, a change of medications, and uncomfortable procedures. Feelings of 
fear, anger, isolation, loss -- and, eventually, peace -- come out in the 
artwork, she reports. 
</P>
<P>
In private offices and hospitals, in psychiatric care and general medicine, in 
diagnosis and treatment of children, adults, individuals and families, and in 
enhancement of work relationships, art therapy -- just as traditional 
psychotherapies -- requires talking. 
</P>
<P>
Art therapy is, in some cases, a springboard to communication, helping patient 
and therapist see what they're going to be talking about. If the topic is too 
painful and the patient too reticent, art therapy can allow them to focus on 
what's represented in the art before they aim, more directly, at what's 
happening in life. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it helps patients clarify issues for themselves. For instance, says 
Linda Gantt, a West Virginia art therapist who is president of the American 
Assn. of Art Therapists, asthma patients can sometimes draw their concept of 
how they feel as an attack begins. The illustration triggers recognition of an 
impending attack, and the patient can do whatever the doctor has recommended to 
avert or minimize it. 
</P>
<P>
Ross tells of a child caught in a custody battle who drew himself on a fence 
between a powerful father and a mother who seemed to have more symbols of 
growth -- plus the jury -- on her side. A week or two afterward, the child 
decided he'd rather stay with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
Art is believed to be empowering: If you make something, you can control it -- 
and then you can use it. At Walter Reed, where the nine art therapists on staff 
are believed to be the largest such group at any one institution in the 
country, formal goals include having angry people draw themselves taking part 
in peaceful activity, encouraging people stuck in repetitive behavior to use 
different kinds of art materials and having addicts draw themselves involved in 
more responsible activities. 
</P>
<P>
And, adds Paula Howie, director of creative arts therapy at the military 
hospital, cancer patients are being taught to visualize their immune systems 
battling their disease. They are instructed to express what they visualize in 
an art form. "It helps them 'concretize' their visualizations," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
The base on which art therapy builds is Freudian. 
</P>
<P>
"Human beings operate on a symbolic level, sometimes on many layers of 
symbolism," Gantt says. In art -- as in dreams, stories, body language, 
clothing and other nonverbal communications -- we create symbols and receive 
messages that are less guarded, less self-serving and sometimes more basic than 
the overt messages of our normal language, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Ross points out, "One picture is worth a thousand words." 
</P>
<P>
It's only worth it if you decode it, of course. Images -- such as monster 
mothers -- are fairly obvious, but Sigmund Freud once said, "Sometimes a cigar 
is just a cigar." Art therapists also warn about the dangers of 
overgeneralizing: "You can't make a big case out of every airplane," Ross says, 
pointing to the planes and rockets on her "graffiti wall," a large canvas where 
child patients have put their pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Because she knows the youngsters, however, she can point to the expression of 
power in this or that rocket, the powerlessness of the figure in the spider web 
cage, the anger in the knives and guillotine. There's a little house on the 
canvas, in which the child artist has written, "No Budy Home." There's a 
bulbous, tentacled alien, which one child drew and another copied, but the copy 
is clearly weaker than the original, and that tells something about the artist 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"Each person has his own themes; there are personal and cultural differences," 
says Howie, who also cautions about drawing too many conclusions too quickly. 
"You would think that dark colors mean depression, but that's not always true, 
sometimes yellow means depression." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, notes Gantt, in our society, white is the color for celebration, as 
in weddings. But in Asian cultures, white is the color of mourning. And in 
India, red is the color for brides. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, she points out, these are "intense colors and they are most often 
associated with intense feelings, like anger, rage, hatred." 
</P>
<P>
Shapes and their relationships to each other are important too, says Fenster. 
Sharp-edged forms and colored lines suggest anger; separation of figures 
signals feelings of isolation; emptiness is depression; fragmentation of the 
pattern is shock, confusion, distress. Flowers and rainbows are more hopeful 
symbols. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the pictures are very pretty, which is emotionally rewarding to many 
patients. But aesthetic accomplishment is not the point. According to Gantt, 
therapists must often say to patients, "We do not expect you to be an artist. 
This is not art class. Very simple marks can convey a lot of meaning. You don't 
have to be Leonardo to pull it off." 
</P>
<P>
To the therapist, process is as important as product. In the ways that people 
create artworks, experts can find clues to their general work habits, their 
sense of organization, their relationships and general dominance: Does one 
person lead and others follow? Does one person impose bizarre images on the 
others, or does the group try to produce a rational pattern? 
</P>
<P>
For the patient the process can also be therapeutic. "It's kind of 
self-soothing," Gantt says. "Sometimes chronically ill patients go almost into 
a trance; they focus their attention on something other than the body." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, too, it's a release. The acquired immune defiency patients Fenster 
works with face losses no one can ever make up. In their art, she says, "They 
make restitution to themselves. The creative act allows for restitution, 
healing, regeneration. With the art, you're tapping into emotion. They're 
hurting inside; they get the hurt out on the paper, and they can leave it 
there, all nasty, or they can turn it into something beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
The nastiness is hard to miss: Short, angry color strokes; sterile trees, 
storms and coffins appear as disease first strikes, and as it worsens. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as acceptance comes, there's beauty: An angel rises, flowers bloom, peace 
returns in remembered pleasures and love transcends despair.

Commercial flights were halted Friday at Sacramento Metropolitan Airport, where 
an electrical fire knocked out the power and the runways' landing lights. 
</P>
<P>
An airport official said at least 17 commercial flights -- most of them 
intrastate commuter runs -- were halted by the power failure, which followed a 
12:30 a.m. blaze apparently caused by a mechanical failure in the airport's 
elaborate electrical system. Many passengers whose flights were canceled were 
taken by bus to airports in San Francisco or Oakland. Flights at the airport 10 
miles north of Sacramento resumed during the day but were halted again Friday 
evening because the runways' beacons remained dark.

LIFE TERM IMPOSED FOR NIGHT OF VIOLENCE

<P>
A judge sentenced a 21-year-old man to 26 years to life in prison plus a 
separate life term for a night of violence that resulted in the stabbing death 
of a 3-year-old Fullerton girl, the attempted murder of his own mother and a 
knife assault on her boyfriend. Superior Court Judge Richard L. Weatherspoon 
also recommended that Michael Robert Pacewitz serve his sentence at the prison 
mental facility at Vacaville. 
</P>
<P>
Pacewitz called the police last March 3 after fatally stabbing little 
Marcelline Onick 44 times while she slept in the Fullerton apartment where he 
was baby-sitting. Prosecutors contend Pacewitz killed the little girl to get 
back at his mother, Elena Fontaine, who baby-sat the girl and treated her like 
a granddaughter. Hours earlier, Pacewitz stabbed his mother repeatedly at her 
Anaheim home, nearly killing her, and assaulted her boyfriend, prosecutors 
said.

REVELERS OFFERED FREE HOLIDAY TOWS

<P>
In an effort to reduce the number of drunken drivers this holiday season, many 
Ventura County towing companies plan to offer free tows to revelers who have 
had too much to drink and wish to get their cars home safely. 
</P>
<P>
The free towing, offered by Towing Operators Working to Eliminate Drunk 
Driving, or TOWED, will be provided to people going home from parties and bars, 
and not to people wanting to go to other parties or bars, campaign coordinator 
Russ Euglow said. Disabled vehicles are also excluded from the TOWED program. 
</P>
<P>
Local towing companies and their counterparts in Santa Barbara and San Luis 
Obispo counties hope drivers will take part in the program rather than 
endangering their lives and the lives of innocent people, Bob Carlson 
Automotive &amp; Towing Manager Joe Bentz said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Carlson and two other companies will offer free towing to party-goers in 
the Ventura area. 
</P>
<P>
"If they utilize this service and they avoid getting pulled over, they've saved 
themselves $1,225," Bentz said. "That's the minimum fine for first-time 
offenders convicted of driving under the influence in Ventura County." FREE 
HOLIDAY TOWING Free towing is offered to revelers who have had too much to 
drink and want to get their cars home safely. Dates of the service vary.

BUTLER AGREES TO A DODGER DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: CENTER FIELDER SAYS HE WILL LEAVE GIANTS FOR A THREE-YEAR DEAL WORTH 
$10 MILLION. HE IS EXPECTED TO BAT LEADOFF. 
</P>

<P>
The Dodgers ended their long search for a center fielder and leadoff hitter 
late Friday by agreeing to a contract with new-look free agent Brett Butler, a 
5-foot-10 player who adds considerable size to their championship hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Butler confirmed the deal about 8:30 p.m. PST, but three hours later the 
Dodgers had not made an announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Said Butler from his Atlanta home: "Yes, sir, I am now signed with the Dodgers. 
I can't tell you how happy I am." 
</P>
<P>
Said Fred Claire, Dodger vice president: "I'm sorry, we are not in a position 
to make a comment." 
</P>
<P>
Butler speculated that the Dodgers were waiting until the other two teams in 
contention for his services, Atlanta and Boston, had been informed. An official 
announcement could come this morning. 
</P>
<P>
In filling two holes that have haunted them since their 1988 world 
championship, the Dodgers gave Butler a guaranteed three-year deal that will 
pay him $10 million, with an option year worth an additional $3 million. The 
option year, which the Dodgers did not include in their original offer earlier 
this week, apparently closed the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The signing has resulted in an outfield that must be considered among 
baseball's best, with Darryl Strawberry in right field, Butler in center, and 
either Kal Daniels or Hubie Brooks in left. 
</P>
<P>
Butler's .309 average for the San Francisco Giants last season would have 
ranked him second on the Dodgers behind Eddie Murray's .330 mark, while Butler 
tied for the league lead with 192 hits. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as it happened I told my wife, 'This is just like a dream,' " Butler 
said late Friday from his Atlanta home. "This is what I've been dreaming about 
since I was 6 years old. To be playing in Los Angeles, in this great winning 
tradition . . . it's sure going to be fun." 
</P>
<P>
This is something the Dodgers have been dreaming about since they lost Steve 
Sax after the 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In Butler they are acquiring a left-handed hitter who has not batted worse than 
.269 nor stolen fewer than 30 bases in any of his eight full major league 
seasons. He has averaged 76 walks per year and only 59 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
He averages more than 20 bunt singles per season. And in completing the image 
of a prototype leadoff hitter, last year he grounded into a double play only 
once every 207 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Butler is the sort of player who is best described by those he plays against. 
Or used to play against. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed a leadoff hitter . . . man, we got one of the best in baseball," 
Daniels said late Friday. "I hate to play against him for a lot of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"First off, in the field, you can't play nowhere where you are sure of stopping 
him. You just can't position him. He will bunt on two strikes. He will turn on 
a fastball and hit it out to right field. He will slap that same fastball up 
the middle." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels said that Butler is equally difficult to face when he is standing in 
center field. 
</P>
<P>
"He uses all his tools on defense," said Daniels, who was victimized by one of 
Butler's diving catches late last year. "I can't remember how many hits he has 
taken away from me. I couldn't talk about that catch he made last year, and I 
still can't talk about." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels said Butler would be the perfect teammate -- if he was assured of being 
his teammate. Because of the overstocked outfield, either Daniels or Brooks is 
expected to be traded for a left-handed pitcher that many feel is the Dodgers' 
final missing piece to a potential championship team. 
</P>
<P>
Both players were puzzled by the Butler agreement. Each feels the trade could 
involve him. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess this means I have no job," Brooks said late Friday. "It's a good 
signing for the Dodgers, but I don't know what the deal is with me. Am I out of 
here? I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Said Daniels: "Somebody has to go, and I've got the feeling that I'm the guy. I 
think I've got more value than Hubie because of the age difference (Brooks is 
34, Daniels is 27) and because I'm a left-handed power hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Butler was wooed by the Dodgers the moment he and 14 others became free agents 
last week as part of a collusion settlement between owners and players that 
dated to 1987. As part of that settlement, the Dodgers are not required to give 
the Giants a future draft pick, unlike earlier this winter when they 
surrendered picks upon signing Strawberry and pitcher Kevin Gross. 
</P>
<P>
Butler was hoping to remain with the Giants, but he was forced out when they 
signed Willie McGee to a four-year, $13-million contract because they assumed 
Butler's demands would be too high. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was saying I wanted $15 million from the Giants -- that was wrong," 
Butler said. "I never made that demand. I was stunned to be left out." 
</P>
<P>
Butler hoped to make as much as McGee, but was let down Wednesday when the 
Dodgers offered a three-year deal worth $7.5 million. The Braves, Butler's 
second choice, countered Friday morning with a similar deal worth only a few 
more dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Red Sox entered the picture Friday by offering a three-year deal worth 
$8.8 million plus Butler's much-desired option year. The Red Sox told Butler 
they needed an answer in 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"And that's what speeded everything up," Butler said. "Suddenly, the Dodgers 
and I were talking seriously." 
</P>
<P>
When Butler was finally given the $10-million offer, he took it to the Braves. 
They refused to match it, and he agreed to sign with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"All I wanted was to be in the realm with other top center fielders, and I am," 
Butler said. "But I tell you what, as close as it was between the Braves and 
Dodgers, if that contract was offered to me by the Braves, I may have signed 
there. It was that close." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers might have filled their hole at second base by acquiring top 
prospect Greg Smith from the Chicago Cubs for former prospect Jose Vizcaino. 
Smith, 23, has played in only 22 major league games in six professional 
seasons. He batted .291 in 105 games for triple-A Iowa last season. In 18 major 
league games last season, the switch-hitter batted .205. Smith's acquisition 
could mean the Dodgers believe that free agent Juan Samuel will not accept 
their one-year contract offer, a decision he must make by Dec. 19.

DODGERS TRADE VIZCAINO TO CUBS FOR TOP PROSPECT 
</P>

<P>
The Dodgers may have filled their hole at second base Friday by acquiring top 
prospect Greg Smith from the Chicago Cubs for former prospect Jose Vizcaino. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 23, has played in only 22 major league games over six professional 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But scouts and several opposing managers who inquired about him this winter 
agreed that if it had not been for Ryne Sandberg, he would have been a 
full-time starter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a guy who can be our everyday second baseman," said Fred Claire, 
Dodger vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's acquisition could mean the Dodgers believe that free agent Juan Samuel 
will not accept their one-year contract offer, a decision he must make by Dec. 
19. If Samuel does not accept, Smith will compete for the job with Lenny Harris 
and Mike Sharperson. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-11 Smith is a former second-round draft pick who batted .291 in 105 
games for triple-A Iowa last season and .296 for double-A Charlotte in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In 18 big league games last season, the switch-hitter batted .205, giving him a 
career .224 average with no home runs and seven runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"He is hard-nosed, he is a battler, he runs well . . . Everybody we talk to 
likes him a lot," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
They used to say those things about Vizcaino, 22, who has been with the Dodgers 
since signing in 1987. He and Jose Offerman were once projected as the 
double-play combination of the future. 
</P>
<P>
But despite a .275 average in 37 games last season, Vizcaino did not impress 
Dodger officials with his hitting. Despite his speed, he has just two 
extra-base hits in 61 major league at-bats.

DRAVECKY PROSPECTS IMPROVE; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: FORMER GIANT PITCHER'S LEFT ARM WILL NOT REQUIRE AMPUTATION, AT LEAST 
FOR THE TIME BEING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For the time being, at least, Dave Dravecky's left arm will not require 
amputation, according to a spokeswoman who talked with Dravecky after a checkup 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Jeana Ledbetter, an assistant to Dravecky's Orange County attorney, said the 
former San Francisco Giant pitcher informed their office Friday afternoon that 
his visit to the Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York went well. 
</P>
<P>
"He called and said it went very well, as well as it could hope to go," said 
Ledbetter, an assistant to attorney Sealy Yates. "He said the doctor gave him a 
very good report. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that will happen is, doctors will continue to monitor his arm 
and every three months he will be checked. But for now, everything seems fine. 
He was very excited." 
</P>
<P>
Dravecky could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Dravecky was openly worried that a recurrence of cancer in his left 
arm would necessitate amputation. 
</P>
<P>
"They could possibly have to amputate my arm," Dravecky said at the time. 
"We've tried everything else. There could be no other choice." 
</P>
<P>
Dravecky is best known for winning a game for the Giants in August of 1989, 10 
months after undergoing surgery for a tumor in his left arm. He retired at the 
end of the 1989 season and wrote an inspirational book about his comeback. He 
has spent much of his time since then giving speeches about that comeback. 
</P>
<P>
But late last summer, the comeback stalled when cancer returned to his arm. For 
eight weeks, he fought it with radiation therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Recent tests did not reveal any new cancer cells, but his meeting with the New 
York doctors Friday was to examine the results more closely. 
</P>
<P>
"We received many calls and letters from people worried about him," Ledbetter 
said. "Everybody around here is very excited by the good news." 
</P>
<P>
Dravecky said last week, however, that Friday's checkup was merely one of many 
hurdles he might have to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I am not healed, and I don't know when I will be healed," Dravecky said 
at the time. "I know I might not ever know. But thanks to the Lord, I know I 
can handle it."

LEAGUE DECIDES AGAINST STICKING IT TO WEBSTER; 
</P>
<P>
KINGS: NHL SPOKESMAN SAYS THERE WON'T BE ANY INVESTIGATION INTO COACH'S 
STICK-THROWING INCIDENT AT THE FORUM. 
</P>

<P>
For Indiana's Bob Knight, it was a chair. 
</P>
<P>
For Cincinnati's Lou Piniella, a base. 
</P>
<P>
For Marquette's Al McGuire, a ball rack. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, coaches and managers in various sports have vented their 
frustration by propelling the nearest handy object to the four winds. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer it was Reds' Manager Piniella flinging a base around Chicago's 
Wrigley Field in a fit of pique, prompting his wife to observe, "I'm a 
44-year-old woman married to an 8-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
Knight's chair-tossing tirade during a game against archrival Purdue a few 
seasons back is legendary, and McGuire's kick of a two-tiered basketball rack 
two decades ago drew retaliation. When the rack hit Dallas sportswriter Randy 
Galloway in the leg, he quickly got into the act, whipping the rack back at 
McGuire. 
</P>
<P>
A new participant joined the infamous sport of hurling Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
King Coach Tom Webster picked up a hockey stick from his perch behind the 
bench, cocked it behind his right ear, and, looking more like Joe Montana than 
the former high-scoring right wing he once was, flung the stick onto the ice 
toward referee Ron Hoggarth. 
</P>
<P>
Webster was: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Furious when he didn't get a whistle after King Brad Jones and Calgary 
Flame James Macoun had gone at it in a corner. Jones went down from a blow by 
Macoun but it appeared from the replay that Jones had swung first, after 
receiving a tough check. Calgary immediately scored at the other end on a 
two-on-one. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Angry that his team was on its way to extending its winless streak to eight 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Determined to motivate his club. Better, he felt, to throw the stick and at 
least get his team's attention than to throw in the towel and lose again 
meekly. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, it didn't work," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just upset more than anything else at the way the calls were going. I 
just reacted. If that helps motivate the team, fine. It shows I'm in there 
battling with them. I can't go out there and help, so I have to show it by 
other means." 
</P>
<P>
Hoggarth ejected Webster for his outburst, but, based on Hoggarth's report to 
the league Friday, no further action will be taken. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an automatic fine of $100," NHL spokesman Gary Meagher said. "But 
after hearing from (Hoggarth), Brian O'Neill (a league vice president) has 
determined that he won't investigate further." 
</P>
<P>
When told of the league verdict, Webster replied: "Isn't that nice. You never 
want to put your team in a hole. 
</P>
<P>
"The really discouraging part is that we didn't come back and win the game. 
We're just not getting any breaks, so you have to do what you can to try and 
turn things around." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings were losing, 2-0, when Webster left and they wound up on the short 
end of a 4-1 score. 
</P>
<P>
But King goalie Kelly Hrudey was happy, nevertheless, to see his coach make the 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm all in favor of doing whatever you have to do," Hrudey said. "If the coach 
is doing something to motivate us, I stand behind that. It was good." 
</P>
<P>
Wing Tony Granato was also impressed with his coach's action. 
</P>
<P>
"He showed us how much he wants to win," Granato said. "He showed us what a 
competitor he is. He was trying to do whatever he could to get the team going." 
</P>
<P>
And in the process, Webster joined a pretty select group, a wild bunch that 
rejects conservatism and throws caution to the wind. 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention anything else they can get their hands on.

LAKERS' WORTHY PLEADS NO CONTEST TO SOLICITING AND IS FINED $1,000

James Worthy has pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor charges of soliciting 
prostitution in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
He was fined $1,000, ordered to perform 40 hours of community service and 
placed on deferred adjudication probation for one year. 
</P>
<P>
If he meets the terms of his probation, both charges will be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy had pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. The new plea was entered 
Thursday in Houston by Worthy's attorney, Cornel Williams. Sentence was 
pronounced by visiting County Court-at-Law Judge Bob Moen. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy was arrested on Nov. 15, before the Lakers' game against the Rockets. 
Houston police said he had called an escort service that they monitor, and they 
sent two officers posing as escorts. They reported that Worthy proposed a 
transaction for sex, and arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers said they had no comment. Worthy has declined to comment since the 
arrest. MARK HEISLER

NEWSWIRE: JACK CLARK, RED SOX ARE CLOSE TO AGREEMENT

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Padre first baseman Jack Clark, a new-look free agent, is expected to 
agree to a three-year contract with the Boston Red Sox today that would be 
worth about $9.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Reich, Clark's agent, and Lou Gorman, Red Sox general manager, have another 
meeting scheduled this afternoon in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Clark said he believes an accord will be reached. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Reich) didn't say that we have a done deal," Clark said from his Danville, 
Calif., home, "but he said he's real positive we'll get things done. And Tom 
usually doesn't say that unless we're very close." 
</P>
<P>
The stumbling block in the negotiations was the Red Sox's reluctance to 
guarantee the third year of the contract, but the Red Sox acceded Friday to 
Clark's demands. The Padres' last offer to Clark was for one year at $2.5

Louisiana Tech has been back in Division I football for only two seasons, but 
that is enough time for Maryland Coach Joe Krivak to know about the potent 
offense his Terrapins will face in today's Independence Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"Tech has great balance on offense and people who can execute it," Krivak said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are explosive and are two-deep at tailback." 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs (8-3) are ranked 10th in the nation with 450 yards total offense 
per game -- 212 rushing and 238 passing. Two of their running backs -- Michael 
Richardson and Jason Davis -- have combined for 2,043 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson has 1,114 yards rushing and 13 touchdowns, and Davis has 929 yards 
and eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bulldogs also have been able to throw the ball. Quarterback Gene 
Johnson has completed 165 of 297 passes for 2,129 yards and 13 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland (6-5) gets 73% of its offense from a passing game directed by Scott 
Zolak (225 of 418 for 2,589 yards and 10 touchdowns). Zolak has led the 
Terrapins to their first winning record since 1985 against a schedule that 
included six Top 25 opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana Tech has a five-game winning streak.

University of Minnesota athletes and recruits received cash, loans, 
entertainment, money for parking tickets and other benefits in violation of 
NCAA rules, according to allegations announced Friday by the NCAA enforcement 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
The letter of official inquiry requested responses from the Big Ten school to 
21 apparent violations, the most serious stemming from the activities of Luther 
Darville, a former university administrator who admitted giving university 
funds to athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"This case appears to be major in nature," David Berst, the NCAA's assistant 
executive director for enforcement, said in the letter. "It appears reasonable 
to expect that the NCAA Committee on Infractions will find violations of NCAA 
legislation." 
</P>
<P>
The infractions committee plans to give Minnesota a hearing during its next 
meeting Feb. 1-3 at Coronado, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The letter arrived a day after Philadelphia Daily News columnist Paul Domowitch 
reported that the investigation was the impetus for stepped-up efforts by Notre 
Dame's Lou Holtz to coach in the NFL. Holtz coached at Minnesota in 1984 and 
1985 and was implicated by LeRoy Gardner, a former Minnesota academic adviser, 
who said the coach once gave him $500 to give to a player. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Keeble, a former player, has said he received $500 from Gardner and 
another $500 from Holtz's secretary. Holtz denies both accusations. 
</P>
<P>
"In my 22 years of being a head football coach I have never been accused nor 
have I been guilty of violating NCAA rules," Holtz said during a news 
conference at South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
"I have always conducted my program both within the letter and the spirit of 
the NCAA rules. I'm looking forward to meeting with the NCAA in February, and I 
feel confident that they will conclude that I did not intentionally violate 
NCAA rules."

INSIDE POST HURTS CHANCES OF SEE ME DO IT

Trainer Bobby Turner winced when See Me Do It drew the rail for the $250,000 
Champion of Champions quarter horse race tonight at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for any horse to win it two years in a row, but it's doubly hard for 
her now," Turner said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
The 4-year-old filly will have to overcome a major track bias if she is to 
repeat in the Champion of Champions and again become world champion. The last 
repeater in either was Dash for Cash, her paternal grandsire, who won both 
honors in 1976 and '77. 
</P>
<P>
Through midweek, after 250 races had been run at the current session, only 17 
winners had started from the No. 1 post, a winning percentage of .068. The No. 
2 post had produced an identically discouraging figure. Only the No. 10 post -- 
five for 104, .048 -- had been less productive. The No. 4 post was best with a 
winning percentage of .17. 
</P>
<P>
See Me Do It, who has won 15 of 19 starts, won the Champion of Champions here 
last year from post No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
"She last drew the rail in the All-American Futurity at Ruidoso (N.M., two 
years ago) and finished second," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Turner was disappointed with the rail, trainer Lee Roy Heidelberg was 
elated with the No. 8 post for Tee-Roy Reb. 
</P>
<P>
"I drew the rail in the Breeders Classic Championship (here Nov. 17) and got 
beat a head and a nose by two great horses, Heisajoy and Jazzing Hi," 
Heidelberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Heisajoy, who has won five stakes in seven tries at Los Alamitos the last two 
years, is expected to be a moderate favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"His shoes are still a trial-and-error thing," said trainer H.L. Hooper, still 
seeking the right combination after several slow starts. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Blane Schvaneveldt, a four-time winner in the 18 previous runnings of 
the race, will be saddling his 28th and 29th starters in Dash for Speed and 
Wicked Dash, daughters of Dash for Cash. Wicked Dash finished fourth in the 
race last year. 
</P>
<P>
Daryn Charlton, conditioner of Jazzing Hi and Apprehend, thinks Jazzing Hi can 
only improve on his runner-up effort in the Breeders Classic Championship. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a lot better and sharper," Charlton said. "I thought that race helped him 
out a bunch, and he only got beat a bob."

HOLLYWOOD PARK; 
</P>
<P>
ITSALLGREEKTOME MAKES ECLIPSE BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine months ago, it would have been almost impossible to imagine 
Itsallgreektome and Eclipse Award in the same sentence. 
</P>
<P>
The son of Sovereign Dancer was fourth in his first three starts of the year, 
running his career record to four defeats in five outings. Shortly thereafter, 
the gray horse was gelded, found turf to his liking and proceeded to make quite 
a name for himself. 
</P>
<P>
Never worse than third in eight races on grass, Itsallgreektome will become a 
strong Eclipse contender as the nation's top turf performer if he wins the 
$500,000 Hollywood Turf Cup Sunday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
In a division without a star, trainer Wallace Dollase's 3-year-old has to be 
admired for his consistency. He came within a neck of beating Royal Academy in 
the Breeders' Cup Mile at 37-1. 
</P>
<P>
Although Itsallgreektome has done most of his winning at Hollywood Park, he has 
performed well elsewhere, and a victory Sunday would push his 1990 earnings to 
$898,925. 
</P>
<P>
Should he come up with a happy ending in the 1 1/2-mile Turf Cup, Dollase won't 
be holding his breath waiting for an Eclipse. He calls With Approval, the 
Breeders' Cup Turf and Arlington Million runner-up, the front-runner, citing 
his hefty turf bankroll and the fact he is based in the East. 
</P>
<P>
If the Eclipse indeed goes elsewhere, there won't be any bitterness on 
Dollase's part. He's had plenty of enjoyment watching Itsallgreektome win, 
place or show in eight straight stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the gelding can make it nine in a row remains to be seen, but there's 
no denying his love for Hollywood Park's turf. He has won the Spotlight, Will 
Rogers and Hollywood Derby locally, and in his only other appearance was third, 
beaten by a length in the Cinema Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
The Turf Cup will mark his first try at 1 1/2 miles, and with his 
come-from-behind style, he will need some luck to work his way through the huge 
field. Fifteen horses were entered Friday morning, with 14 being allowed to 
start. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's a go," Dollase said. "He's real good. He's the same as he always 
is. He loves this course and he's very relaxed over it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure about the 1 1/2 miles, but he trains like he'll be able to handle 
it. (The distance) is the question mark, and there's so much luck involved in a 
field of this size." 
</P>
<P>
Another concern for Dollase is the distinct possibility of a very slow pace. 
"He does have a bad habit of slowing up as soon as he gets to the lead," the 
trainer said. "You have to time his move just right. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Ascot Handicap (on Sept. 22 at Bay Meadows), they went a half-mile in 
48 (seconds), and he wanted to gallop over the top of them. Fly Till Dawn is 
going to try and go as slow as he can." 
</P>
<P>
Like Itsallgreektome, Fly Till Dawn had only one victory entering 1990, but if 
he succeeds Sunday, an Eclipse case could also be made for him. The Turf Cup 
would be his third Grade I victory this year, following upsets in the Eddie 
Read Handicap at Del Mar and the Budweiser International on Oct. 21 at Laurel. 
</P>
<P>
However, the field the 4-year-old Swing Till Dawn colt beat in the 
International was suspect -- the race occurred six days before the Breeders' 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Fly Till Dawn also has never tried 1 1/2 miles but has run well at Hollywood 
Park. He has only won once in four tries, but two of his defeats were by a neck 
and a head. 
</P>
<P>
Rial is proven at the distance, having won the Oak Tree Invitational on Oct. 6, 
and trainer Pico Perdomo said his disastrous effort in the Dec. 1 Native Diver 
Handicap can be dismissed. The 5-year-old Family Crest horse finished last in 
the main-track race. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran in the Native Diver for two reasons," Perdomo said -- to find out if 
Rial really likes the dirt and to give him a race to get ready for the Turf 
Cup. He worked well (1:01 flat Tuesday), and Jose (Santos) said he feels the 
horse will be much better this time." 
</P>
<P>
The other prime contenders in the race include Silver Ending, who was fifth in 
the Hollywood Derby; Eradicate, the runner-up in the Oak Tree Invitational who 
worked a mile on the turf in 1:36 3/5 last Sunday; Live the Dream, and Silver 
Medallion. The rest of the field is Hodges Bay, Vaguely Hidden, Double Wedge, 
Nediym, Mashkour, Athenia Green, Missionary Ridge and also-eligible Big 
Warning. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Summer Sale is one of 11 horses entered in today's $84,950 
Hollywood Turf Express Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
After holding off Ofanto and Oraibi in last year's Express, Summer Sale was 
winless until he beat One Drink by a nose in the Rich Cream Handicap on Nov. 
12. He has a series of fast workouts at Golden Gate Fields since the race and 
will again be ridden by Alex Solis. 
</P>
<P>
Although able to get to the lead without any pressure in the Rich Cream, Summer 
Sale won't have such a luxury today because of the presence of Valiant Pete. 
Upset winner of the California Cup Sprint, Valiant Pete ran 43 1/5 seconds for 
the half-mile that day, then held on to beat Sensational Star by a half-length. 
A 4-year-old son of The Irish Lord, he has a victory and a third place in three 
starts on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
Also set to go the six furlongs are Answer Do, Yes I'm Blue, Earn Your Stripes, 
Waterscape, All of Me, One Drink, Roman Avie, Sam Who and Despatch. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
One of the most-improved horses around is Blaze O'Brien. The 3-year-old Interco 
gelding won his third straight race Friday, outfinishing River Warden under 
Gary Stevens in a swift 1:39 4/5 for the 1 1/16 miles on the turf. He is 
trained by Julio Canani and owned by Barry and Susan Isaacs, who campaigned 
Irish O'Brien, Blaze O'Brien's dam.

EASTERN FACES NEW ALLEGATIONS OF FAKING DATA; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: THE LATEST CHARGES WERE CONTAINED IN AN AFFIDAVIT THAT WAS FILED TO 
SUPPORT A FEDERAL RAID OF THE CARRIER'S MIAMI HEADQUARTERS TWO WEEKS AGO.

<P>
Eastern Airlines, in court documents made public Friday, was accused of faking 
aircraft maintenance records in Atlanta and Miami. The new allegations indicate 
that improper maintenance practices that prompted an indictment of the carrier 
in July continued up through last month. 
</P>
<P>
The latest charges were contained in an affidavit that was filed to support a 
federal raid of Eastern's Miami headquarters two weeks ago. The affidavit was 
unsealed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn after Eastern lost an appeal to 
keep the document secret. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit states that Eastern maintenance supervisors -- under pressure to 
avoid flight delays -- routinely faked records to show that repairs were made 
when they were not. The incidents described in the affidavit took place at 
Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport and at Miami's airport from 1987 to November, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the alleged safety violations took place before the machinists union 
struck the carrier in March, 1989. The allegations are similar to those 
contained in a July indictment of the airline that concerned maintenance 
practices at New York's John F. Kennedy International and La Guardia airports. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern vigorously denied the allegations. In a statement, the carrier said 
most of the charges were vague and appeared to be made by mechanics who are 
still on strike against Eastern. One of the government informants has been the 
subject of disciplinary action at Eastern, the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern stressed that the Federal Aviation Administration kept a close watch on 
Eastern's maintenance practices and has found nothing amiss. And, in an 
unusually strong counter-attack, Eastern bankruptcy trustee Martin R. Shugrue 
accused an unnamed assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn of turning Eastern into 
"a career-building case." 
</P>
<P>
"The same assistant U.S. attorney leading the vendetta against Eastern has some 
67,000 frequent-flier miles," Shugrue said in a statement. "Enough said." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.S. attorney said the office had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
The latest round of charges is yet another blow to the troubled carrier. The 
carrier's creditors have sought in bankruptcy proceedings to liquidate it. But 
a bankruptcy court judge in November gave Eastern permission to spend $135 
million from an escrow account, enough to keep it going through spring. 
</P>
<P>
As it struggles to survive, Eastern has tried to build an image as a reliable 
and safe airline. The allegations, if true, are especially troublesome for 
Shugrue, who was appointed trustee in April. At least two of the alleged 
incidents -- including a faked entry concerning an oil leak -- took place on 
his watch. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the airline believed the new 
allegations would have little effect on ticket sales.

FDA PANEL GIVES GREEN LIGHT TO NEW AMGEN BIOTECH DRUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY STAVRO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended Friday that 
Amgen Inc.'s newest biotechnology drug be approved for use in cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, called granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, spurs production of 
white blood cells that help chemotherapy patients fight off infections. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts think it will become a blockbuster product, eventually a $200-million- 
to $450-million-a-year seller for Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Final FDA approval for G-CSF is now virtually certain, said Jim McCamant, 
editor of Medical Technology Stock Letter in Berkeley. He expects the drug to 
be on the market within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
The news ignited Amgen stock. It surged $2.75 Friday to a record $59.25 per 
share. 
</P>
<P>
But Amgen's new drug will have competition. On Thursday, Immunex, a 
Seattle-based biotechnology concern, also received a favorable review from an 
FDA panel on its new white blood cell product called GM-CSF. 
</P>
<P>
However Immunex's drug is expected to be approved to treat bone marrow 
transplant patients, while Amgen's drug would be approved for cancer patients 
undergoing chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
"The cancer market is much larger," McCamant said. Insurance companies, he 
said, tend to reimburse for new drugs only if they are used according to FDA 
recommendations, so McCamant initially expects Amgen to dominate the white 
blood cell drug market. 
</P>
<P>
The drug will be Amgen's second biotechnology product. Its first, a 
gene-spliced protein called erythropoietin or EPO, produces red blood cells 
that treats chronic anemia in patients with kidney disease. EPO sales are 
running at an annualized rate of about $300 million with profits from the drug 
coming at the rate of nearly $50 million a year.

New McDonnell Douglas Credit Pact: The St. Louis-based defense contractor said 
it has signed a new credit agreement with 21 banks, providing $750 million in 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which replaces a series of expired credit lines that provided 
$710 million in credit, reflects the banks' confidence in the company, 
McDonnell officials said. The agreement is in addition to two other credit 
pacts negotiated earlier this year that provide $1.4 billion in credit. 
McDonnell is among the most heavily indebted firms in the aerospace industry.

<P>
Poor economic reports and renewed worries about the Persian Gulf sent Wall 
Street stocks tumbling Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials dropped 20.55 to 2,593.81, closing out 
the week with a net gain of just 3.71 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advances by about 2 to 1 in 
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 526 up, 1,025 
down and 473 unchanged. Volume on the NYSE came to 150.88 million shares, down 
from 162.11 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sagging market based on sagging hopes for peace and sagging prospects 
for lower interest rates in the immediate term," said Alan Ackerman, market 
strategist at Reich &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve said factory production in November tumbled 1.7%, its 
sharpest decline since January, 1982, while the Labor Department said wholesale 
inflation rose an unexpectedly strong 0.5%. "That was a double dose of deadly 
news," said Allen Sinai, chief economist at Boston Co. 
</P>
<P>
Investors were particularly concerned that the bad inflation figures would stop 
the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks also were hit by comments from two Republican senators that President 
Bush was frustrated with the failure to arrange peace talks with Iraqi leader 
Saddam Hussein and was prepared to give up the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Bush accused Hussein of stalling the U.S. effort to arrange peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the bottom line is once again it suggests that a peaceful resolution, 
at this point, is not a certainty," said Brad Turner, chairman of the 
investment policy committee at McDonald &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Reflecting broad worries about the sinking economy, the Dow was weighed down 
by GM, off 1 to 33 1/4, IBM, down 1 5/8 to 111 1/4, Merck, off 1 1/2 to 86 5/8, 
and McDonald's, down 3/4 to 29 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Oil stocks rebounded a bit from their recent slump as Mideast war fears grew. 
Arco jumped 3 to 124, Unocal added 5/8 to 26 1/2 and Chevron inched up 3/8 to 
69 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Airline stocks were big losers on new fare-war fears. Delta fell 2 1/8 to 56 
7/8, USAir lost 7/8 to 15 1/8 and AMR, parent of American, slumped 1 3/4 to 50. 
</P>
<P>
* Security Pacific fell with most other bank stocks, off 7/8 to 21 1/8. 
Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's both downgraded the company's debt, citing 
loan worries. 
</P>
<P>
* Food and drug stocks, strong of late, lost ground. They were led lower by 
Gerber Products, which dropped 4 1/4 to 56 after a Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. 
report said sales volume of Gerber's baby food should remain flat for the 
second half of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Also, drug firm Syntex lost 2 3/4 to 57 5/8 on investor disappointment with a 
recommendation by a panel of the FDA that a new stroke-prevention drug be 
approved for only a small patient base. Also, Medtronic fell 5 1/4 to 84 3/4. 
The company said it temporarily suspended test implants of a new heart device. 
</P>
<P>
* Ashton-Tate plunged 1 3/8 to 6 1/4 after the firm lost a software copyright 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
* Carolco Pictures rose 1 to 8 7/8 on reports that Chief Executive Peter 
Hoffman had secured an unspecified line of credit to buy Carolco common stock 
on the open market. Pioneer LDCA Inc. and Canal+ Productions, which have equity 
ownership in Carolco of about 10% and 5% respectively, have also been granted a 
waiver of their standstill agreements, which will permit them to each purchase 
up to an additional 1 million shares of stock in the open market. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks fell from their highs and closed lower following a sharp drop 
on Wall Street. The Financial Times 100-share index ended down 3.8 points at 
2,168.4, down 15 points for the week. 
</P>
<P>
In a reversal of Thursday's trading pattern, Germany's 30-share DAX index moved 
higher after a disappointing start. The index finished 4.60 points higher at 
1,522.40. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices fell slightly in Tokyo. The 225-issue Nikkei average shed 293.47 
points, or 1.2%, to close at 24,349.50. 
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Slump on Inflation Report 
</P>
<P>
News of higher wholesale prices and troubles facing Middle East peace talks 
sent bond prices skidding for a second straight day. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell 25/32 point, or $7.81 per $1,000 in 
face amount. Its yield jumped to 8.18% from 8.12% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said prices also were hurt by hawkish testimony by Defense Secretary 
Dick Cheney before a House Committee. Cheney said that if the economic attempts 
and diplomatic efforts to solve the Kuwait crisis fail, the United States must 
have the option of using force to oust Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 7.313% late Friday, up from 7.25% on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Silver, Platinum Futures Decline 
</P>
<P>
Silver and platinum prices fell on New York's Commodity Exchange as the latest 
economic indicators pointed to a severe slump in the manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
"That makes for a very weak industrial future," said analyst Jim Steel of Refco 
Inc. in New York. Because silver and platinum are heavily used in industry, 
news of further industrial production declines hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Silver has been on a downward slide since the start of the year, as traders 
looked upon it increasingly as an industrial metal. A large percentage of 
silver is used by the film industry. It also is used by telecommunications 
companies and defense manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
Silver plummeted 6.9 to 7.7 cents, with the contract for delivery in December 
at $3.94 an ounce -- lowest since 1974. Platinum was $2.30 to $3 lower, with 
January at $412.20 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures moved in the opposite direction, supported by a surge of oil 
prices early in the day. Gold was $2.40 to $3.30 higher, with December at 
$376.70 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Crude oil futures gave up much of a $1.68 early gain in a late retreat, as 
President Bush was less aggressive than expected in discussing the gulf crisis 
during an afternoon news conference. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Edges Up in Light Turnover 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose slightly amid the nervousness over the Persian Gulf crisis, but 
trading was quiet. 
</P>
<P>
In New York trading, the U.S. currency rose to 1.482 German marks from 1.479 on 
Thursday. It also rose to 132.85 Japanese yen from 132.17. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound fell to $1.9370 from Thursday's $1.9450.

Most of the nation's largest banks are teetering on the brink of insolvency and 
tax money must quickly be injected into the government fund insuring deposits, 
warns a congressional report due out Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bank failure costs could total $63 billion in a severe recession, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Even the mild downturn expected by most economists would leave the fund short 
of cash, said the report, which was written by three economists at the request 
of a congressional subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
"This nation faces an almost unprecedented situation in having most of its 
largest banks operating on -- or conceivably, over -- the edge of insolvency," 
said the report, prepared for the House Banking subcommittee on financial 
institutions, chaired by Rep. Frank Annunzio (D-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
The study was written by Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution, a 
Washington-based think tank; James Barth of Auburn University and R. Dan 
Brumbaugh of Stanford University. Barth and Brumbaugh are former chief 
economists of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the regulatory agency since 
dismantled -- of the savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
The report is due to be released at a public hearing Monday, but the Associated 
Press obtained the economists' summary on Friday.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has ordered the Navy to justify the A-12 attack 
plane in three weeks or else kill it, the Pentagon announced Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Delays, cost growth and management deficiencies in the A-12 "are intolerable," 
Cheney said in a directive to Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
"If we cannot spend the taxpayers' money wisely, we will not spend it," Cheney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary gave the Navy until Jan 4 to justify the plane.

CARBON MONOXIDE, THE SILENT KILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carbon monoxide is a silent killer. It sneaks up on its victims, odorless and 
colorless. It makes people drowsy and puts them to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, according to an EPA study, 1,500 people nationwide died of carbon 
monoxide poisoning, another 10,000 were poisoned but lived. 
</P>
<P>
Often, as was apparently the case in Tijuana where authorities believe 12 
people died from asphyxiation and six others were injured from a butane-burning 
lantern, the lack of simple air circulation, through a vent or open window is 
the main factor that allows the deadly gas to accumulate. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Anthony Manoguerra, director of the Regional Poison Control Center at UC 
San Diego Medical Center, said that, although the Mexican deaths have the 
appearance of carbon monoxide poisoning, only laboratory blood tests can 
confirm it. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials are relying on the San Diego County medical examiner's office 
to conduct those tests. 
</P>
<P>
Manoguerra said symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are headaches, nausea and 
possibly vomiting. Often, he said, people don't recognize the symptoms for what 
they are and associate them with some other malady. 
</P>
<P>
"They think there's some other reason they aren't feeling well," he said. 
"Often they don't put the symptoms together. 
</P>
<P>
"You can drift into (sleep) before you realize what is happening." 
</P>
<P>
For those who survive, their prospects of good health depend on factors such as 
how long they were exposed. The medical center, for example, has a hyperbaric 
chamber it uses to treat people poisoned by the gas. By raising the air 
pressure, the chamber increases the amount of oxygen in the body tissues, 
removing the carbon monoxide from the blood more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
In Tijuana, where there is no hyperbaric chamber, officials are administering 
oxygen to the six survivors who were poisoned. Manoguerra said this works but 
usually takes longer. 
</P>
<P>
Manoguerra said that, depending on the severity of the poisoning, it is not 
unusual for people to suffer permanent nervous system or brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
Manoguerra said carbon monoxide is usually a byproduct of any system that burns 
natural gas, such as butane or propane, in the presence of oxygen. If 
everything is working properly, the system will produce carbon dioxide -- the 
harmless gas that is expelled when people exhale. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the system is receiving inadequate amounts of air or is faulty 
internally, it instead spews out deadly carbon monoxide, he said.

JUDGE'S RULING MOVES REDISTRICTING FIGHT TO STATE COURTROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL BEN-ALI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bitter challenge to an approved San Diego redistricting plan once again came 
to an end in federal court after a judge remanded the case to the state, saying 
the federal court lacked jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
Stating that it would be difficult for state court judges to play "catch-up" on 
a case that has been largely tried in federal courts, U.S. District Judge John 
S. Rhoades nevertheless said "no federal jurisdiction exists, and I'm therefore 
remanding the case to Superior Court." 
</P>
<P>
The redistricting plan, approved by the City Council in September, redrew the 
boundary lines of several voting districts. Supporters say the boundaries allow 
District 8, which stretches from downtown to the South Bay, to increase its 
percentage of Latino voters from 40% to 53.8%, possibly allowing for the first 
election of a Latino City Council member in this century. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the redistricting, principally the four City Council members who 
voted against the plan, led by Mayor Maureen O'Connor and City Councilman Bruce 
Henderson, say the plan is a result of secret meetings, a violation of the 
state' Brown Act, and were gerrymandered. 
</P>
<P>
They say that, although they have no dispute with the boundaries of Districts 4 
and 8, which increase the number of black and Latino voters respectively, the 
plan unfairly breaks up the Asian-American and Pacific Islander voter 
concentration in District 5. 
</P>
<P>
"Big victory for us," Henderson said of Rhoades' decision. "When the council 
acted, they totally ignored (the Asian-American) concern and split Mira Mesa 
and Linda Vista. We're going to put that back, and, in fact, we're hoping a 
Filipino-American will run in the District 5 race against Linda (Bernhardt)." 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney ruled Thursday that only voters within the former boundaries 
of District 5, which combines Mira Mesa and Linda Vista, could vote in 
Bernhardt's recall election. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Zappe, the attorney who represented Rancho Bernardo Community Council 
leader Jim Abbott and three other plaintiffs in their attempt to have the case 
for the other districts moved into state court, said she was pleased with the 
judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"What we plan to do, once it gets back in state court, is go forward with 
depositions of council members and try to resolve it," Zappe said. The city, 
which attempted to have the case completed in federal court, appeared the loser 
in Friday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not happy, but we'll face that issue when we come to it in state court," 
said Jack Katz, a senior litigation attorney for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have preferred that it all be handled in one jurisdiction, one venue. 
Inasmuch as (federal court judges) have been handling it since its onset, and 
they're well aware of it, they know all of the ramifications and all of the 
ultimate effects since this thing occurred," Katz said.

RESCUE TEAMS GET READY FOR THE BIG ONE 
</P>

<P>
Two cars lay crushed beneath an 80-ton section of a collapsed highway bridge at 
UC San Diego as part of an unusual drill Friday in which rescue workers 
practiced how to free victims like those killed and injured in the 1989 Bay 
Area earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The simulation showed what might happen to drivers passing under highway 
bridges during a major earthquake and how rescue teams would free them. 
</P>
<P>
The drill, sponsored by the San Diego Fire Department, pulled together 
disparate agencies with heavy-duty equipment useful in freeway disasters, said 
firefighter Kevin Ester, who coordinated the exercise. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way we could have done this by ourselves," said Ester, looking at 
two holes cut into the top of the bridge through which firefighters dragged out 
dummy victims. "It could have taken us half a day. With all the equipment and 
help, it only took us two hours." 
</P>
<P>
More than a hundred people showed up for the daylong drill -- private 
contractors with diamond-edged concrete saws and house-sized cranes, workers 
from the city's Public Works Department with jackhammers, and sheriff's 
deputies with their rescue dogs. Firefighters from agencies throughout the 
county, including National City, Coronado, Camp Pendleton and Chula Vista, and 
rescue workers from Mexico, stood on the sidelines and watched. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, to get a bridge section and some 
cars underneath it, and be able to work in a non-emergency situation," Ester 
said. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego's earthquake research laboratory supplied the 60-foot section of 
highway, which it had been using for three years to study the effects of 
earthquake-like forces on cement highway structures. The section was cut from 
California 41 near Fresno after California Department of Transportation 
engineers had deemed it unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
"It can't get more real than this," said Frieder Seible, assistant director of 
the laboratory. "The Loma Prieta quake had scenes that looked just like this." 
</P>
<P>
The disaster scene, staged at the intersection of Old Miramar Road and Voigt 
Drive on campus, prompted one student to call 911 and report two cars trapped 
under a bridge, Seible said. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the laboratory, one of a handful of earthquake research 
centers in the world, helped Caltrans study sections of the Nimitz Freeway 
after it collapsed during last year's Bay Area quake, caused by the Loma Prieta 
Fault, that killed 42 people. 
</P>
<P>
The laboratory will help Caltrans review all state highway bridges for a 
retrofitting program Caltrans hopes to complete in 1993, Frieder said. It has 
just begun reviewing bridges in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The laboratory had been working with the city Fire Department for several years 
researching equipment and methods for rescuing victims surrounded by concrete 
or other heavy structures, typical of what would be found in urban areas after 
a disaster, Frieder said. 
</P>
<P>
The exercise gave firefighters a chance to learn how to cut concrete, crib, or 
stabilize the structure with wood planks, and excavate pathways to reach and 
retrieve victims entombed in concrete and steel, Frieder said. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department's heavy rescue unit is planning to form the volunteer 
contractors and agencies into a task force that could respond quickly to 
emergencies, Ester said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything went like clockwork," said Capt. Perry Peake of the department's 
heavy rescue unit. "It really shows that we are on the right track."

OCEANSIDE DROPS 95 JOBS, 1 FIRE TRUCK IN BUDGET CRUNCH; 
</P>
<P>
CITY SERVICES: COUNCIL WILL RECONSIDER KEEPING TWO POLICE HELICOPTERS IN THE 
AIR AS CITY STRUGGLES TO AVOID AN EXPECTED $5.8-MILLION DEFICIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In a desperate cost-cutting move, the Oceanside City Council on Friday 
eliminated 95 jobs and made public safety reductions to avoid an expected 
$5.8-million budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The council's 5-0 vote authorized acting City Manager Jim Turner to slash 
spending, but agreed to consider saving the Police Department's helicopter 
program, even if it means limiting operations. 
</P>
<P>
Two days before the council's action, nearly 500 city residents flooded the 
Civic Center to protest public safety cuts, especially the proposed grounding 
of the two helicopters that had begun flying only five months before the budget 
crisis hit. 
</P>
<P>
Having previously heard hours of public comment, the council approved the 
budget reductions without debate. After the vote, Councilwoman Melba Bishop 
said, "Everything was put into effect at once." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the 95 jobs cut from the city's 954-person work force are 
temporary positions, or vacant positions that won't be filled. The city has 
also relied on early retirements or voluntary reduction of work hours to reduce 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the budget trimming will be visible in small ways. 
</P>
<P>
Tram service at the Oceanside Pier will be limited, beach lifeguard service 
will be reduced, the Marshall Street Swim Center will be closed until summer 
and various city functions -- everything from maintenance to getting copies of 
police reports -- will be slower. 
</P>
<P>
The only proposed cuts that provoked public outcry were the grounding of the 
police helicopters and the removal of one of six fire engines from service. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve firefighters will be reassigned from the engine crew to ambulance duty, 
allowing the city to save nearly $500,000 by canceling its contract with a 
private ambulance firm. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no demotions, no layoffs of any fire suppression personnel," 
Fire Chief Jim Rankin said after the council's vote. 
</P>
<P>
Rankin, when asked whether the loss of a fire engine will slow emergency 
response, replied, "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
However, firefighter Eric Bertotti, who represented the Oceanside Firefighters 
Assn. in negotiations with the city over budget cuts, said it will sometimes 
take longer to respond to emergency calls downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to extend the response time, that's common sense," Bertotti said. 
"We're working with one less engine, which is a major concern for us. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to help the city with the budget crisis, but we also want the city to 
recognize the public safety issue is still there." 
</P>
<P>
The council learned last month that Oceanside was in financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
When the $227-million spending plan for fiscal 1990-91 was approved last 
summer, the city staff wrongly advised the council that there was a healthy 
beginning balance of $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
A sharp increase in city spending in recent years has compounded the problem. 
Since fiscal 1988-89, the police budget has risen $5.8 million and the fire 
budget has increased $2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 Marines from nearby Camp Pendleton 
have been sent to the Middle East; their absence has hurt downtown businesses 
and reduced the city's revenue from the sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
Further, a depressed housing market has slashed the revenue Oceanside expected 
from developer fees and fees paid for city engineering, planning and building 
services.

9 INJURED IN FIRE AT DOWNTOWN HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine people were treated for smoke inhalation Friday night after a fire at the 
downtown Maryland Hotel at 630 F St., Battalion Chief Richard Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel had 201 residents, most of them retired, a desk clerk said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Capt. Al MacDonald said the fire started when a resident of Room 511 lit a 
cigarette, the match accidentally fell on his bed and he turned his back. When 
he turned back, the bed was in flames, MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs said the fourth through sixth floors were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters rushed 20 trucks to the hotel and extinguished the blaze at 9:52 
-- within 10 minutes of the time it was reported, Jacobs said. Heavy smoke on 
the upper floors forced the evacuation.

2 BLACKS PLEAD NO CONTEST IN RIGHTS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two black men who were the first minority defendants to be charged locally with 
violating the civil rights of whites pleaded no contest Friday to battery. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Maxey, 25, and Donnie Lee Alexander, 19, both of San Diego, entered 
their pleas to the felony charge, which stems from a series of attacks upon 
whites that were alleged to have been racially motivated near Belmont Park in 
Mission Beach on Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge William Mudd set sentencing for Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Luis Aragon said the battery charge is normally a 
misdemeanor, but in this plea the enhancement of civil rights violation was 
added, which makes it a felony. 
</P>
<P>
Aragon said his office agreed not to ask for a state prison term at sentencing 
and will agree to local time in custody under terms of probation. 
</P>
<P>
The men could also face a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous other defendants locally have been charged with committing hate crimes 
against victims because of their race or sexual orientation, but this is the 
first case in which the victims were white and the defendants belonged to a 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
The victims included a 70-year-old man and a 5-year-old boy. Witnesses told 
police the attackers yelled racial slurs and made comments about "white trash." 
</P>
<P>
In a plea-bargain agreement, Mudd dismissed other counts of assault with a 
deadly weapon, robbery and civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander and Maxey are free on bail posted previously at $10,000 and $5,000 
respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
About 2,100 residential customers and 46 businesses lost power just after 2 
p.m. Friday when a San Diego Gas &amp; Electric transformer malfunctioned, 
company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The transformer, at the Kettner Boulevard substation at Palm Street, produced a 
loud boom when its circuit breaker tripped, shutting off power to residential 
customers in the western end of Hillcrest, said Maurice Luque, company 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Power was restored to residential customers at 3:30 p.m. and to businesses in 
the Harbor Drive area near Lindbergh Field by 4:30 p.m., Fred Vaughn, another 
company spokesman, said. The airport was not affected. 
</P>
<P>
A portable transformer will be used until it is determined what caused the 
failure and the transformer is repaired, Vaughn said. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said such malfunctions usually happen once or twice a year, 
and usually during lightning storms.

AZTECS HAVE PROVEN THAT THEY ARE WORTHY OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congratulations to Coach Al Luginbill and the San Diego State Aztecs, who 
proved this season that they are capable of scoring on quality defenses from 
anywhere on the field. I look forward to games at home against Wyoming, BYU, 
Hawaii, Utah, Air Force and Colorado State, who are traditional WAC opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Non-conference foes such as UCLA, Cal, Miami and USC in '92 sweeten our 
schedule in the year to come. 
</P>
<P>
In my way of thinking there is no better way to spend a Saturday evening or 
afternoon than watching the Aztecs at our beautiful San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Those in this community who continue to complain about the Aztecs do so from 
the comfort of a chair of inactivity. If they did venture to the Aztec games, 
they would be drowned out by the roar of San Diegans who have found a quality 
team to support.

SOUTHWEST PREVAILS DESPITE 39 BY GREEN 
</P>

CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ice ice, baby, so cold. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest drop in temperature Friday night at Chula Vista High came sometime 
between the second and third quarters, when everything the Spartan boys' 
basketball team touched turned frigid. 
</P>
<P>
And while Chula Vista turned cold, Southwest heated up in a hurry, registered 
an 83-75 Metro Conference victory and bounced back from a dismal 20-point loss 
Tuesday to Bonita Vista in its conference opener. 
</P>
<P>
So it's still early in the season. But after the lopsided loss earlier in the 
week, forward Devin Patterson, who led Southwest with 22 points, said a victory 
at Chula Vista was timely. 
</P>
<P>
"This was real important," said Patterson. "Chula Vista's one of the top teams 
in the Metro Conference. And this was a real confidence builder." 
</P>
<P>
One Chula Vista (4-3, 1-1) player who didn't need a confidence boost at any 
point in the night was 6-foot-2 forward Jerome Green. 
</P>
<P>
Green, a sophomore, and senior Shane Howell figured to be the one-two punch 
that would knock out a good many opponents during Chula Vista's season. 
</P>
<P>
Green had a game-high 39 points, including a four three-point baskets in the 
fourth quarter, and Howell had 13 points before fouling out early in the 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
But it their virtual silence in the second and third quarters that turned the 
shape of things in Southwest's favor. After Chula Vista's Miguel Quinones 
scored with three minutes remaining in the third quarter to pull to 54-52, the 
Spartans weren't heard of again until the Andy Duran scored at 4:44 in the 
fourth, and trailing, 65-54. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew we had to stop Green from three-point range and start coming up with 
more rebounds," said Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest (3-4, 1-1) also got a clutch free-throw performance from Roger Galang 
(21 points), who was 8 of 9 from the foul line and from Patterson, who went 9 
of 14. 
</P>
<P>
"Our free throwing really helped us down the stretch," Southwest Coach Steve 
Selland said. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista, hurt by the transfer of Carnell Penn to Virginia and by late 
additions who were playing football long after basketball practice had started, 
has established itself as a one or two-dimensional team. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders countered that with balance, and getting help from everyone. Toby 
Limjoco (10 points) and Zachary Reiff (11 points) were in other players in 
double figures. Jerry Racette led Southwest with 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"One guy didn't beat them," Selland said. "We shut them down as a team. And one 
guy didn't win it for us. We won it as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista coach Mike Collins said the Spartans, who have given up an average 
of 70 points this season, must plug the holes in its defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We're giving up way too many points," he said. "And we didn't do that much on 
offense tonight."

NORTHRIDGE UPSETS USD, DEPRIVES EGAN OF 100TH VICTORY 
</P>

NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The comments were loud, clear and to the point. They were not the comments of a 
happy coach. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Egan, in his seventh year as coach at the University of San Diego, had a 
chance Friday night against Cal State Northridge to win his 100th game. He did 
not. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge upset USD, 83-73, in front of 368 at the Matador Gymnasium, a 
facility a group of students are trying to get renamed the Matadome since the 
Matadors (2-6) are 2-0 in the building since becoming a Division I member this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought the other team played very well," said Egan, who was visibly upset. 
"They outhustled us. They outexecuted us. They ran their stuff. They played 
like a team. 
</P>
<P>
"We did none of the above. Absolutely NONE of the above. At ANY time. We had no 
consistency tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Pete Cassidy, coach of the Matadors for 20 seasons, was asked if he was 
surprised his team won so handily. His reply: "I think so . . . no, what am I 
saying? I know so." 
</P>
<P>
Behind the three-point shooting of Kyle Kerlegan, who finished with a team-high 
18 points, and the slicing and driving antics of point guard Andre Chevalier, 
who scored nine of his 16 points in the second half, Northridge began taking 
control of a tight game 4:05 into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Kerlegan made his second consecutive three-pointer to begin a 25-7 
run that didn't end until the Matadors led, 67-52, with 9:10 left. Kerlegan 
added the fourth of his five three-pointers and two free throws during the run. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been humiliated on the road," said Cassidy, whose team was winless on 
the road and had allowed more than 100 points in five road games. "And I have 
some guys with tremendous pride. We were tired of being humiliated." 
</P>
<P>
USD made a 15-5 run to pull to 72-67 after a three-pointer by Michael Brown 
with 3:42 left but could not get any closer. The Toreros then missed shots, 
turned over the ball and had shots blocked just like in the first part of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't look at the schedule and think this was going to be a cake walk. You 
are the ones that have been saying that," said Egan, who directed some of his 
frustration at the media. "I've said all along, this is a basketball team that 
has to perform very well and together to be good. I've had a hole in my gut all 
week about this game. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is disappointing. This is as disappointed as I've been. Ever." 
</P>
<P>
Each team missed its first three shots to set the tone for the first half. It 
was ugly, perhaps even pathetic. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, it was close, and therefore somewhat suspenseful, but only because neither 
team could get anything going. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team scored more than four points in a row in the first half, and 
neither took a lead of more than four points. 
</P>
<P>
USD took a 35-34 lead into the intermission. Fittingly, Kelvin Woods rebounded 
his own miss and layed it back in for a 35-33 lead with 14 seconds left. The 
Matadors had a chance to tie it five seconds later, but Chevalier missed the 
second of two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreros know all about missed free throws. USD, which made a season-low 50% 
Monday in a 72-63 loss at UC Santa Barbara to fall to 60.7% on the season, 
missed eight of 10 in the first half. USD made four of four in the second half, 
but Northridge made 18 of 25 (72%) in the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Toreros weren't much better from the field, making only 32 of 82 (39%) 
shots, including 16 of 49 (33%) in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Center Dondi Bell led the Toreros with 18 points, followed by Pat Holbert with 
17 and Anthony Thomas with 16. 
</P>
<P>
USD has a week off before traveling to Eastern Washington next Saturday.

ADAMS, HELD TO 20 POINTS, SPARKS GRANITE HILLS PAST HER EX-TEAMMATES

<P>
Granite Hills' Christina Adams was held to 20 points in her first meeting 
against her former Grossmont High teammates, but her 13 second-half points 
rallied Granite Hills to a 55-45 victory Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, a senior guard who had averaged 38.3 points a game and had broken the 
state basketball single-season scoring record while at Grossmont, was held to 
only seven points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"Christina said she didn't feel pressured, but I know she felt it," Granite 
Hills Coach Len Klingshirn said. "It was a big thing for her to do well against 
them. There was more pressure than she let on." 
</P>
<P>
Adams transferred to Granite Hills after Frank Foggiano was fired as coach of 
the girls' and boys' teams last season. The Foothillers made it to the Division 
II quarterfinals under Foggiano's direction last season. 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont led, 10-5, after the first quarter, but Adams warmed considerably in 
the second quarter, scoring seven points and hitting a three-pointer to give 
the Mighty Eagles a two-point lead with four minutes left in the half. Adams 
had three three-pointers on the night. 
</P>
<P>
Granite Hills, ranked seventh in the county, countered the Foothillers' 
third-quarter surges with shooting by Sallie Wade, who scored nine second-half 
points and finished with 13, and Brande Wray, who had 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of talent on the team," Klingshirn said. "If we balance the 
scoring, it will relieve some of the pressure on Christina. We have capable 
scorers out there. It's still early. We just haven't jelled yet." 
</P>
<P>
Grossmont and Granite Hills exchanged three-pointers early in the third period, 
but a 12-4 run gave the Mighty Eagles a 39-31 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Susie McManos scored 15 and Lori Redondo had 11 for the 
Foothillers. TERRY RATHER

EXHIBIT: RETROSPECTIVE OF DUANE MICHALS PHOTOS SHOW WORK THAT IS BOTH OFTEN 
ENTERTAINING AND SOMETIMES POWERFUL.

<P>
Perhaps it is just coincidence that the simple title of "The Duane Michals 
Show" seems more fitting for a comedy hour than a 30-year museum retrospective 
of a noted New York photographer. 
</P>
<P>
But images of, say, Howdy Doody persist when faced with a blow-up self-portrait 
of Michals using his head and hands to make a shadow image of a duck on the 
wall behind him at the entrance to his show at the Museum of Photographic Arts 
in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Guileless and often goofy, Michals seems content to leave a first impression of 
himself as an entertainer in this first American survey of his work. But, as 
the wide selection of more than 200 black-and-white photographs quickly shows, 
Michals is much more. A mix of portraits and multi-image narratives with short 
written texts, this wonderful show combines humor with nostalgia, religious 
commentary, astute social observation and personal fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
A bluntness and modesty pervades this work, a simplicity that encourages each 
viewer to go further beyond the surface. To project and extrapolate. To be 
swept up in the nostalgia, without being trapped in sweetness. To keep an eye 
on the gimmick inherent to the medium, while still appreciating its enormous 
power. 
</P>
<P>
An early work sets the tone of surrealist quasi-religious symbolism and 
photographic manipulation that remains consistent throughout. "The Illuminated 
Man," 1968, shows a shadowy man whose head has been transformed into a 
featureless, glowing flash of light. "I Met God in the Subway," 1990 -- the 
latest here -- takes the same theme further: a man is shown riding the New York 
subway, his head lit from behind to look like a halo. Just below, the artist 
has written: "I met God in the subway/He looked like you and me/I asked which 
train went to Heaven/He said take number three./When I got off in Heaven/It 
looked like Union Square/Seems when you go to Heaven/You don't go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Constantly questioning reality in art and in life, in both of these works 
Michals plays the mysterious powers of manipulation available to the 
photographer against the mysticism of religion. Calling himself a "lapsed 
Catholic," Michals has spoken often of his devoutly religious childhood. A 
sense of paradise lost governs much of his work, imbued with a nostalgia for 
the transcendent visions that can come through faith. 
</P>
<P>
There is a slightly mocking tone to such quasi-religious work, but it is dryly 
mixed with the possibility of optimism. That Heaven and Earth are equal, that 
death does not transcend life. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1932 in blue-collar McKeesport, Pa., a Pittsburgh suburb that was also 
the birthplace of Andy Warhol, Michals has made many works that appear directly 
autobiographical. His unresolved relationship with his father is often a 
subject, among these one of the most subtle yet most poignant is the 1978 "Self 
Portrait Shaking Hands with My Father." 
</P>
<P>
In a barren room, the two men shake hands at the extreme right side of the 
photo, and the contrast between them is striking. The older man, slightly bent 
from age, wears a somewhat rumpled suit, a mark of formality that hides the 
fact that he is a retired factory worker. The younger Michals wears a dark 
turtleneck, casually formal as would befit an artist. In their handshake is the 
symbol of resolution, across what appears to be significant distance. An open 
door at the left of the picture appears as an escape route from these powerful 
emotions. 
</P>
<P>
Death comes up often in Michals' work, too, with a sense both of sorrow and 
curiosity yet never morbidity. Hamlet's Yorick, for example, is remembered in a 
memento mori picture of a young man holding a skull. Scrawled below in the 
artist's rough hand is a short poem "All things Mellow in the Mind . . ." about 
the brevity of life. "So Let's hold tight, and touch and feel," Michals wrote, 
"For this quick instant we are real." 
</P>
<P>
There are lighter moments, too, belying Michals's Pop background and his links 
to a post-modern real-life metaphysic that is similar to the work of artists 
such as John Baldessari and Edward Ruscha, among others. 
</P>
<P>
A group of exquisite celebrity portraits -- many of them originally commercial 
work done for magazines -- starts the show. Some are of well-known artists, 
including a rare pair of portraits of Joseph Cornell, as well as images of 
Warhol, Marcel Duchamp and Rene Magritte. Others are of movie and arts stars: 
Dennis Hopper lounging on the floor in a cigarette-smoke-filled room, Joe 
Dallesandro as a gargoyle on a New York rooftop, and a beautiful but apparently 
narcissistic Russian ballerina Ludmila Tscherina, who is shown just in the 
circular frame of a hand-held mirror in a photograph from 1964. 
</P>
<P>
And the narrative can be both sweet and borderline cute, like children's book 
illustrations: One well-known work shows a child who looks up at a coat and hat 
hanging on a rack, then falls asleep and dreams the bogey man has come to life. 
</P>
<P>
A series of forays into painting shows the artist painting on top of vintage 
photographs, obliterating the precious images of photographic masters with 
colorful childlike imagery. Here, Michals exhibits a bad-boy daring reminiscent 
of when Robert Rauchenberg erased a Willem DeKooning drawing. 
</P>
<P>
Michals's 1989 work, too, takes a tongue-in-cheek jab at the pretentions of 
photography: "There Are Nine Mistakes in This Photograph" shows a man reading 
an upside-down newspaper with an upside-down top hat on his head, sitting 
across a breakfast table from a blindfolded girl eating cake, among other 
foolishness. "Can you find them?" the picture teases. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, all of Michals' art seems immediately accessible. A renegade 
from the seriousness of both fine-art photography and photojournalism, Michals 
makes it all seem easy. But, again, there is more than meets the eye. Lighting 
and darkroom techniques often add enormous subtlety to the beauty of the 
prints. And the exact precision of the artist's language belies the labor 
behind both the poetry and the prose. 
</P>
<P>
And Michals is hardly blind to the potential impact of his work. "Someone Left 
a Message for You," 1974, shows a hand writing backward on a sheet of paper; 
the scrawled text revealed progressively over four photographs says "As you 
read this I am entering your mind." 
</P>
<P>
No kidding.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT / CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN: VERSATILE PLAYER TURNS 
OUT AN 18TH-CENTURY GLASS ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH HERMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Theater organist Dennis James is well known to the regulars of the San Diego 
Symphony's Nickelodeon series. 
</P>
<P>
The lanky musician with the permanent grin has accompanied every silent film at 
Copley Symphony Hall since the orchestra inaugurated the series in January, 
1988, with a screening of Douglas Fairbanks' "Robin Hood." 
</P>
<P>
But what most of the local silent movie fans don't know is that James is also a 
world-class virtuoso on the glass armonica and the theremin, an early 
electronic instrument. 
</P>
<P>
This armonica is composed of a series of bell-shaped glasses on a revolving 
horizontal axis, with each glass providing a different note. The sound is made 
by a moistened finger touching the edge of a turning glass. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people refer to these as oddball instruments, but I prefer to categorize 
them as unusual instruments," said James, who is in town to accompany a Laurel 
and Hardy short, "Selling Christmas Trees in Southern California" on the 
symphony's holiday WinterPops concerts at 8 p.m. today and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I see my interest in the glass armonica and other forgotten instruments as a 
natural outgrowth of my work on the theater organ." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, film buffs and musicians have eagerly restored old silent 
film prints and unearthed the musical scores and cue sheets that have made it 
possible to present these pioneer cinema efforts in their proper original 
ethos. Once sound tracks were added to motion pictures, of course, theater 
organs and the obligatory pit orchestras in urban movie palaces had become 
obsolete by the early 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
"The further away we get from the actual era," James explained, "the greater 
the impetus is to restore instruments to their original function." 
</P>
<P>
During his 15 years as resident organist of the Ohio Theatre in Columbus, a 
post he left a year ago, James honed his accompanying technique and acquired a 
substantial repertory of scores for silent films. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always saying that 90% of the old silent films were lost, but it is 
also true that a large percentage of the really good films were preserved. I 
have been able to find either cue sheets or actual scores for most of these 'A' 
films. From the music I now have, I can play another five seasons of silent 
films without repeating any I've done so far." 
</P>
<P>
Next year's plethora of Mozart festivals to mark the bicentennial of the 
composer's death has turned into a bonanza of concert dates for James and his 
glass armonica. A popular instrument in the late 18th Century invented by Ben 
Franklin, the glass armonica caught the fancy of a number of European 
composers, including Mozart. He wrote a solo piece for the musical glasses, as 
the instrument is sometimes called, and a more extended chamber opus, "Adagio 
and Rondo in C Minor," K. 617, for glass armonica, flute, oboe, violin and 
cello. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, when James first began to teach himself to play the glass armonica, he 
thought there was little repertory for the obscure instrument, but he has been 
able to turn up more than 500 pieces that require Franklin's musical invention. 
</P>
<P>
"Even Mozart's orchestration of Handel's 'Messiah' calls for the glass 
armonica," James noted. 
</P>
<P>
James' concert travels during the Mozart bicentennial year will take him to 
festivals in Australia and New Zealand as well as Europe. He is particularly 
eager to perform the "Adagio and Rondo" with original instrument guru Roger 
Norrington and his London Classical Players in identical all-Mozart programs in 
London's Queen Elizabeth Hall and New York's Lincoln Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't explain it, but the glass armonica has really caught on in France and 
in Italy. After I played in it Paris a couple of years ago, Bernard Raffielli 
of the Sorbonne decided to write a play set in the 18th Century in which I 
perform on the glass harmonica. He sent me the script, but when the producers 
realized how execrable my French was, the playwright made my character a mute. 
We've performed the play 'Glass Music' in Nantes, Nancy and Angoulem. And, on 
my next trip to France, we will tape it for French television." 
</P>
<P>
To keep in practice, James carries one of his glass armonicas with him when 
traveling. The delicate nature of the instrument's sound makes it possible for 
him to practice in his hotel room when he's not involved in orchestra 
rehearsals. He keeps his two other glass armonicas packed away in 
earthquake-proof crating in his Berkeley home. 
</P>
<P>
James will return to San Diego next month (Jan 4, 8 p.m.) to accompany the 
symphony's next Nickelodeon series offering, the 1920 classic silent film "Way 
Down East," starring Lillian Gish. 
</P>
<P>
Nautical but nice. Leon Natker, director of San Diego Comic Opera, announced a 
unique performance of Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta "H.M.S. Pinafore" to be 
presented the summer of 1992 on the Star of India. The historic sailing ship 
will then be permanently moored on the Broadway pier, on which bleachers will 
be built for the audience. The company players will use the 19th-Century ship 
as their stage and set, aided by some distinctly 20th-Century amplification. 
The production will be a joint effort of San Diego Comic Opera and the San 
Diego Maritime Museum, which maintains the Star of India. 
</P>
<P>
Even more opera. San Diego Opera has announced additional performances of 
Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte" (Jan. 30), Strauss' "Die Fledermaus" (March 13) and 
Verdi's "La Traviata" (May 11). Each of these operas will have five 
performances, with the best seats available on the added dates. Single tickets 
for all of the local company's 1991 season are now sale at the Civic Center box 
office, 202 C St., and all TicketMaster locations. 
</P>
<P>
For the May 11 "La Traviata" performance, San Diego Opera general director has 
announced the following cast changes: American soprano Frances Ginsberg will 
sing the title roles, replacing Christine Weidinger; tenor Walter MacNeil will 
replace Fernando de la Mora as Alfredo Germont, and baritone Richard J. Clark 
will replace Richard Stilwell as Giorgio Germont. 
</P>
<P>
Military salute. The San Diego Symphony is offering 300 free tickets to 
Sunday's "Holiday Delights!" concert to all military personnel and family 
members. The free passes will be given out on a first-come basis starting at 4 
p.m. at the Copley Symphony Hall box office. (One ticket will be given for each 
military identification card presented.) The 8 p.m. concert will feature the 
San Diego Symphony and the St. Paul's Boys Choir under guest conductor Carl 
Hermanns.

EDWIN LESTER: A BENEVOLENT RULER OF MUSICAL THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The age of chivalry in the arts may well have ended Thursday with the death of 
Edwin Lester. Not only was Lester, 95, the founder of the Los Angeles Civic 
Light Opera and the undisputed prince of musical theater in this city, but he 
was a man universally respected for the classy way in which he conducted his 
business and his life. 
</P>
<P>
Like the organization he ran for almost 40 years -- a phenomenally successful 
commercial musical venture -- Edwin Lester was always slightly larger than 
life, more grand opera than operetta, but with a sense of humor that tempered 
the grandiloquence and a keenness of mind that stayed with him until the very 
last days. 
</P>
<P>
He brought musical theater to Los Angeles in the mid-1930s and remained its 
reigning monarch until his self-appointed retirement in the late '70s -- an 
empirical, benevolent ruler who ran his domain with the ironclad ethics and 
impeccable manners that earned him respect, even from those -- perhaps 
especially from those -- who did not necessarily share his musical tastes. 
</P>
<P>
"He lived his theater, the Civic Light Opera was his mistress," said singer 
Patricia Morison, who had auditioned for him as a young woman. "Musical theater 
was fun when he did it. He employed people in this town. He gave young people 
breaks. He could be old-fashioned and opinionated but also very loyal." 
</P>
<P>
Loyalty was a hallmark. A gentleman of the old school, Lester got as good as he 
gave. He was surrounded most of his life by stalwart associates, such as 
Eleanor Pinkham and his longtime secretary, Joan Gilmore, who were as devoted 
to him as they were to his causes. But Lester, who could be surprisingly 
high-handed in his unquestioned self-assurance, paradoxically never let success 
spoil him. He was a hands-on producer who personally answered all his mail and 
had absolute regard for his subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Musical tastes were another matter. His were often questioned and did not 
change with the changing times. He made no secret of preferring operettas and 
"book musicals with happy endings." He believed the test of time to be the only 
true measure of successful musical writing and was no fan of the new style of 
musicals ushered in by Stephen Sondheim. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't stop him from respecting what others saw in Sondheim and bringing 
"Company" (1971) and "Pacific Overtures" (1976) to the CLO. 
</P>
<P>
When "Cabaret" -- considered racy for his audience -- had come to CLO in the 
late '60s, Lester had acknowledged it was not his kind of show but that he 
respected it, adding that he would have made some changes had it been up to 
him. What changes? Well, instead of those buxom German dancers, he would have 
substituted svelte and beautiful women -- precisely what "Cabaret" was not 
about. 
</P>
<P>
After he had ceded the reins, LACLO was never the same. But Lester either never 
let its decline bother him or never admitted that it did. As far as he was 
concerned, the Edwin Lester Civic Light Opera began and ended with Edwin 
Lester. What he couldn't help or couldn't change he would not allow to affect 
him. He never uttered a word of criticism or leveled a single complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Only once, when the LACLO was going through a particularly bad patch at the 
hands of his successors did he venture the opinion that he had perhaps retired 
a little too soon. 
</P>
<P>
As he grew older, and especially after his retirement, he became more and more 
relaxed, engaging and delightful. We maintained a lively correspondence and had 
dinner from time to time. Mostly, my husband and I were his guests. Only once 
were we able to lure him to our home. He clearly preferred it the other way. 
Playing host had become his occupation of choice and he did that too in style. 
</P>
<P>
While he was still at LACLO, he once shipped a box of chocolate-covered 
pretzels to our home for Christmas. Not wanting to seem to curry favor, he 
signed the card with an X. But it wasn't hard to track down the gift-giver and, 
playing along with the mystery, I responded with a thank-you note signed with a 
Y. This became our private joke and annual conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
Every year thereafter a box of chocolate-covered pretzels arrived promptly at 
our door for the holidays. They were, he said, his favorite. Christmas won't be 
the same without them.

<P>
It could have been a blowout. But it almost ended in a blowup for the 
Brea-Olinda High School girls' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Cats, the 1989-90 Division III state runners-up, had to hold off 
Alemany to escape with a 49-40 victory Friday night in a semifinal game of 
their own tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Cats (7-0) will play Gahr at 7:30 tonight in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"We were flat. We played poorly," said Brea-Olinda Coach Mark Trakh. "We've 
played better." 
</P>
<P>
Neither team could find the range until Alemany forward Brenda Garcia hit a 
jumper 2 minutes 4 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians played Brea-Olinda tough in the first quarter until the Lady Cats 
went on a 10-0 spree at the end of the period and early in the second quarter 
to take an 18-6 lead with six minutes to play before the half. 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda held a 28-11 lead at the half even though it made only four of 13 
shots in the second quarter. But its five free throws in seven attempts, and 
Alemany's poor shooting in the quarter (one of seven from the field), helped 
the Lady Cats increase the margin. 
</P>
<P>
Williams and freshman guard Nicole Erickson (11 points) each scored six points 
in the third period to give Brea-Olinda a 42-25 lead after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Things got more interesting after that. Williams got into foul trouble and sat 
out most of the fourth quarter, and the Indians outscored Brea-Olinda, 13-2, in 
a five-minute span to close the gap to 46-40. 
</P>
<P>
"That hurt us," Trakh said about Williams' foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Senior guard Cathy Lewis had 10 points for Brea-Olinda. Alemany was led by 
junior guard Rachel Corelli with 17. 
</P>
<P>
In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Tustin 66, Katella 45 -- Christine Garner had 19 points and 19 rebounds and 
Sheri Needham had 18 points and 16 rebounds for Tustin (6-2) in the consolation 
semifinal game. 
</P>
<P>
Chaffey 66, Costa Mesa 63 (OT) -- Despite 34 points by guard Olivia DiCamilli, 
the Mustangs fell in a semifinal game for fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
DiCamilli had an opportunity to give Costa Mesa the victory at the end of 
regulation but she missed two free throws with no time left on the clock to 
send the contest into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Rachel Ward had 14 points for Costa Mesa. Center Tamika Phillips led 
Chaffey with 28 points.

LAMB'S SWEETENED 'CAROL' GOES WITH DINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The least memorable part of "Dickens, Dining &amp; Song," the newest Lamb's 
Players Theatre Christmas offering, is, alas, the Dickens. 
</P>
<P>
In part, that criticism is a tribute to the dining and song -- both of which 
are very fine indeed, thanks to an impressive chef, Paul Vida, and the six 
spirited and sweet-voiced madrigal singers who serenade the diners throughout 
the three-hour event. 
</P>
<P>
But it also reflects the skimpy 50-minute adaptation of "A Christmas Carol," 
which is thrown in like a dessert after a 90-minute dinner of awesome roast 
beef and turkey in the Great Hall of St. Paul's Cathedral at 5th and Nutmeg. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb's resident playwright, Kerry Meads, originally adapted the timeless story 
for four actors to tour schools and churches. The result is more impressive for 
its cleverness in condensing the story than it is for sending home the heart of 
Dickens' tale about a man desperately in need of reclamation and how the 
characters in the poverty-stricken world around him may live or die on the 
basis of the changes he does or does not make. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Maley plays Ebenezer Scrooge and Sharon Maley (Maley's real-life wife), 
Eric Briner and Lori Merril play the other roles. But many of the most 
emotionally wrenching parts are left to the imagination: the Ghosts of 
Christmas Past, Present and Future who come to haunt Ebenezer; Jacob Marley, 
come back from the dead to warn his old friend of the doom that awaits him if 
he doesn't change his stingy ways; frail, innocent Tiny Tim perched on the 
shoulders of his father, Ebenezer's poor clerk, Bob Cratchit. 
</P>
<P>
This has the unmistakable sense of a show played more for children than adults. 
Not only are the frightening ghosts gone, but the iciness at the heart of old 
Scrooge is softened into eccentric grumpiness. Bob Cratchit and his family 
don't really seem to be starving. This is a comfortable looking company that 
tells the story with fine, dramatic expression, but they don't make you feel 
the want, the pain and, most importantly, the stakes involved in the 
alterations Scrooge needs to make in himself and in his world. 
</P>
<P>
Dickens' message has been sweetened and simplified. Instead of the story 
Dickens wrote to rail against hard-hearted businessmen going about their 
business in the wake of general misery, this becomes a story about a man who 
would get along with others better if he would just loosen up and smile. 
</P>
<P>
But the story goes down easily with dinner and all the trimmings: hearty 
stuffing, mashed potatoes, carrots, Yorkshire pudding, served by beautifully 
costumed food servers and passed around the tables family-style. And the dinner 
and dessert buffet (after the play) goes down well in the beautifully decorated 
Great Hall, with twinkling lights in the trees on either side of the stage and 
in the green boughs wrapped around the wooden beams. 
</P>
<P>
What Lamb's has attempted and largely succeeded in doing is to create a 
prosperous, idealized version of a 19th-Century Victorian feast and 
celebration. Norman Rockwell might have sketched a picture much like this. 
</P>
<P>
The madrigals are lovely, and the music curls seductively around the hall, 
almost palpably softening the expressions on the faces of the 250 people seated 
at the handsomely set and decorated tables. The message is to enjoy, to relax. 
If you want a challenging "Carol," check out the San Diego Repertory Theatre 
production. 
</P>
<P>
But if you want to sit back and meet some pleasant table mates in an atmosphere 
that exudes comfort and goodwill, this is the place.

BIAS AGAINST OCBCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading the article by Mark Pinsky on the Orange County Business 
Committee for the Arts ("Support Doesn't Always Mean Cash," Nov. 17), I was 
left with a very uncomfortable feeling and a rather sour taste in my mouth. In 
trying to figure out why I reacted this way I had to read the article several 
times and then I came to the conclusion that there was bias and innuendo 
written into nearly every paragraph. 
</P>
<P>
I could not figure out why and still cannot. 
</P>
<P>
My own relationship with the OCBCA, through the Decorative Arts Study Center in 
San Juan Capistrano, has been only positive and that of unfailing support. As 
acting president of the Executive Board of Trustees of the DASC, I know how 
important board development is to a fledgling organization such as ours. After 
hearing of our financial problems, (Business Committee executive director 
Betty) Moss placed two very knowledgeable men on our board; one from Ernst 
&amp; Young, the other from Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher. Their expertise has 
enabled us to grow as rapidly as we have, and we are extremely grateful to Ms. 
Moss and the OCBCA for recognizing our need and moving so quickly to get us the 
necessary help. 
</P>
<P>
I nonetheless keep wondering why the bias in the Nov.17 article. The purpose of 
the OCBCA is to encourage business support of the arts in all manners. In my 
book, that's exactly what they are doing.

NUTS &amp; BOLTS: A STICKY BUSINESS THAT HUMS IN NO TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a back-yard pursuit, beekeeping, like nuclear waste management, is not for 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine Mike Tyson with a poison javelin and the heart of a kamikaze warrior. 
These are bees. And when you become a beekeeper, they become your pets. They 
will teach you restraint. 
</P>
<P>
They will also provide you with a fascinating example of communal urban living, 
they will help to coax your flowers and fruit trees into glorious bloom and 
they will crank out great gobs of honey that will make the store-bought stuff 
seem like Valvoline. 
</P>
<P>
There is probably no starker example of the concept of getting what you pay 
for. Raw honey, straight from the hive, is one of the most sublime taste treats 
the earth can offer. Thousands of years before the invention of the fried pork 
rind, discriminating epicures were snacking on honey and sweetening other foods 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
To get at it, however, they had to swipe it from creatures with a sense of 
territory that would make Marines defending a beachhead seem hospitable. 
</P>
<P>
But, Morris Ostrofsky says, peaceful coexistence is possible, and the payoff is 
worth it. Ostrofsky, a biology teacher at Rancho Santiago College, has been 
keeping bees in his back yard for 15 years and sells beekeeping supplies out of 
his Tustin garage. The bees that live in his two back-yard hives, he says, 
produce about 300 pounds of honey each year and, for the most part, have been 
good neighbors. They also love his 15 fruit trees and have helped to keep them 
healthy, fragrant and productive. 
</P>
<P>
Ostrofsky says he became fascinated as a youngster by a hive of bumblebees that 
had taken up residence at a friend's house but later became further intrigued 
by honeybees because "these insects could make something that tasted so 
wonderfully good. It's far superior to the honey you buy in the supermarket. 
It's unheated, unfiltered, unpasteurized, un-everything." 
</P>
<P>
Store-bought honey, he says, is routinely heated, a process that clarifies the 
honey and makes it look appealing but upsets a delicate chemical balance and 
robs it of some of its flavor. Honey in its raw state often crystallizes and 
hardens and appears less pure, but one taste will tell you that looks aren't 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
If you really love the stuff and wouldn't mind a limitless supply in your back 
yard, it's pretty easy to get started, Ostrofsky says. You'll need a hive, 
which looks like nothing more remarkable than a wooden box (beginners should 
start with a single box and gradually add boxes to the hive, he says). Inside 
the box are sections called frames, on which the bees will build honeycombs. 
They slide easily in and out of the box. 
</P>
<P>
And you'll need bees. You can buy them already in a hive, he says, or you can 
contact the U.S. Department of Agriculture. They will put your name on a list, 
and when a swarm is removed from a house you'll be called to come and pick up 
the bees. 
</P>
<P>
Or, he says, you can capture a swarm yourself. Often this involves nothing more 
than snipping off a tree branch that a swarm has landed on and carting the 
whole thing away. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, you'll need protection: gloves, a protective jumpsuit and a netted 
helmet. 
</P>
<P>
All this will cost you about $100, Ostrofsky says. But if you sell the honey 
your bees produce (Ostrofsky sells his honey for $1.50 a pound), the little 
workhorses will pay for your initial outlay in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
Tending a hive can be learned from reading any of several books on the subject, 
says Ostrofsky, who occasionally teaches a class in beekeeping at Rancho 
Santiago College. 
</P>
<P>
However, he says, you shouldn't plunge in without checking the level of the 
neighbors' enthusiasm. You'll also want to check local beekeeping ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, however, restrictive ordinances aren't enforced unless a complaint 
is lodged, Ostrofsky, says, so butter up the neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the part you've been waiting for: Expect to get stung. Even if you wear 
full protective gear, chances are that a bee or two will find a piece of 
exposed skin and decide to go out in a blaze of glory. You must therefore know 
whether you're allergic to bee stings. 
</P>
<P>
The only way to find out, he says, is to get stung. If the area around the 
sting swells up, that's normal. If you have trouble breathing, you're allergic 
and should give up beekeeping for something safer, like defusing unexploded 
bombs. 
</P>
<P>
(You actually need to be stung twice to get a true determination, he says.) 
</P>
<P>
If there's no unusual reaction, though, and you decide to turn your back yard 
into Honey Central, you can probably look forward to becoming immune to the 
stings, like Ostrofsky. How many times does he get stung each year? 
</P>
<P>
"It's more realistic to ask how many times I get stung each day," he says. "You 
generally stop reacting (to the stings) after a year. A lot of beekeepers get 
to the point where they stop wearing the protection." 
</P>
<P>
As does Ostrofsky. Once, while moving a hive, he tripped and the hive fell on 
top of him. He was stung, he says, 160 times "within a matter of minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Painful, he says, but no reaction. 
</P>
<P>
What makes it all worth it, he says, is what he calls "the greatest pleasure 
for me in beekeeping:" the smell of ripening honey. 
</P>
<P>
"It just perfumes the whole yard, and it's just incredibly fresh and fragrant," 
he says. "You just don't get a smell like that in the city." 
</P>
<P>
There's another advantage, one that even Ostrofsky -- who acknowledges that 
some people are more afraid of bees than they are of the IRS -- might not have 
thought of: home protection. The only problem with this is that bees are only 
aggressive when provoked, and at night they're blind and almost immobile. 
</P>
<P>
But how many burglars do you suppose know that?

ASK THE HANDYMAN: NEW DOORJAMB MAY OUTSHINE A PUTTY JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: While maneuvering a trailer into my garage, I made a mistake and put 
a large gash into the garage doorjamb. Instead of having to remove that piece, 
isn't there some kind of putty I can use to fill it in? 
</P>
<P>
J.A., Irvine 
</P>
<P>
Answer: "If it's bad enough to look at, your best bet is to replace the jamb 
rather than try to fix it," says Jason Bartolone of Ganahl Lumber in Anaheim. 
"The wood putty that you see in stores is mainly just for filling in small 
spaces and indoor use. The jamb is usually a 1-inch by 8-inch piece that can be 
cut to the height of the doorway. Removing the old jamb can get pretty messy 
because you're taking some of the stucco off with it. You'll have to use some 
stucco repair around the new jamb and paint to make it match the stucco around 
the house." 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have an old Oriental rug stored away that I would like to attach to the 
wall. What's the best way to hang it? 
</P>
<P>
L.T., Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
A: "How you hang your rug is going to depend first on the type of rug it is," 
says Arlene Spielman of Villa Park Wall Boutique. "If it's silk, you can encase 
it between pieces of Lucite and frame it, which is an attractive way of hanging 
a delicate rug. If it's heavy, you may want to use a piece of 1x1-inch wood 
that's 2 inches shorter than the width of the rug. Staple the wood to the top 
back of the rug, then hang the wood on the wall. By centering the wood, you 
shouldn't see it when it's on the wall. You can also put one on the bottom to 
make it look even when it's hung." 
</P>
<P>
Q: The cut leaf maple tree in our back yard is about 30 years old and, while 
it's beautiful and thick in summer, it also keeps sunlight from getting to the 
lawn and flowers around it. I want to prune it myself; is there anything in 
particular I should know before doing it? 
</P>
<P>
A.K., El Toro 
</P>
<P>
A: "That's something you see a lot of in cut leaf maples," says Mike Inaba of 
Roger's Gardens nursery in Corona del Mar. "They don't grow very tall, maybe 20 
feet at the most, but they grow out horizontally. What you want to do is make 
it look spread out, so your basic plan should be to thin some of the larger 
branches. Remember to make your cuts about 1 inch above the node, which is 
where the branches fork. There are also several good booklets available at 
garden stores specifically on pruning that might give you some insight into 
making it look good." 
</P>
<P>
Q: The tile on our kitchen counter is about 12 years old and it's in pretty 
good shape overall, except that in a few places there are some chips and nicks. 
No one seems to make this tile anymore, is there a way to fix the bad ones 
without replacing them? 
</P>
<P>
M.M., Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
A: "If you can't find the replacement tiles, you've got two choices," says Mark 
Handleman, a tile setter based in Santa Ana. "Try going to a place where they 
make ceramics and see if they have a glaze that would match your tiles. You can 
put the glaze on the chips, which isn't perfect but it's better than leaving 
them exposed. Or, if the bad tiles are in different areas around the counter, 
you can replace them with tiles of contrasting colors that can be done in some 
sort of pattern or just randomly, which a lot of people do now when installing 
tile." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our fireplace brick was painted white by the home's previous owner and we'd 
like to remove it and keep it natural. Is there a sure way to get paint off 
masonry? 
</P>
<P>
V.T., La Habra 
</P>
<P>
A: "The problem with masonry is that it's very porous," says Bill Martin, a 
bricklayer in Fullerton. "You've got to take paint thinner and rags and rub out 
as much as you can. Then take more thinner and a wire brush and scrub the 
bricks until you get the paint of the pores. It's a long, dirty job, you just 
have to curse the people who painted them."

DEATHS OF 12 AT TIJUANA RITE BLAMED ON GAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coroner's officials said Friday that 12 people who died during a nightlong 
religious ceremony in a closed, four-room house asphyxiated from carbon 
monoxide poisoning caused by a butane-gas lantern used for light. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Vazquez, a deputy district attorney here, said the windows and doors of 
the small house in Colonia Mariano Matamoros on the southeastern edge of the 
city were shut tight, keeping fresh air from getting inside. There apparently 
were no vents in the house that would have allowed the gas to escape. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely an accident," Vazquez said of the Thursday-morning incident. 
</P>
<P>
As the lantern continued to burn, people began falling asleep, a symptom of 
carbon monoxide poisoning, officials said. Not everyone in the house died; five 
victims were found unconscious and hospitalized. A sixth survivor -- who was 
said to have escaped sometime during the ceremony -- was taken to the hospital 
later Thursday and was in serious condition. Three remained comatose Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the dead and injured are related. Among the dead were two mothers, each 
of whom perished along with her two children. Also killed were a husband and 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican authorities have now ruled out a fruit punch found at the house as a 
source of the deaths. The group drank the fruit punch, which one survivor said 
led to screaming, and officials at first believed the beverage was contaminated 
with an industrial solvent or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
The all-night religious ritual apparently played a role in the deaths. On 
several occasions Wednesday night, people tried to enter the house but were 
turned away by the group's spiritual leader, Federico Padres Mexia, or others 
who were participating in the religious ceremony that included chanting and 
standing or sitting inside a circle delineated by a rope with 13 knots that was 
laid on the floor. Mexia, 61, is now in a coma. 
</P>
<P>
A survivor, Alfredo Osuna Hernandez, 22, said the group was engaged in a 
"cleansing" ritual that began early Wednesday night. Asked why no one left to 
seek help, Osuna said, "It is very damaging to leave the circle." 
</P>
<P>
The daughter of one of the victims, Ana Faviola Miranda Juarez, 19, who entered 
the house early Thursday morning, said it smelled strongly of gas. She didn't 
disturb the apparently slumbering occupants, who included her mother, because 
she felt the ritual was still under way, and said some of the people were 
snoring. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, Gloria Miranda Juarez, 45, owned the home and lived there with 
Mexia. She was among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
News of the deaths continued to consume Tijuana and its media on Friday. Some 
relatives of the victims were furious over Mexican newspaper reports 
characterizing the deaths as a result of some satanic rite. 
</P>
<P>
Several family members who gathered outside a public hospital, awaiting word on 
their loved ones, said that their relatives were staunch Roman Catholics, and 
that some had gone to Mass on Wednesday to celebrate the religious holiday of 
Our Lady of Guadalupe. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Moreno, 23, whose sister died and whose mother is comatose, said his 
mother recited the rosary every night and blessed her children. "The man who 
ran the tortilla shop told my mother our whole family was under a spell of bad 
luck," Moreno said. 
</P>
<P>
His mother thought that perhaps he was right, because of the family's lack of 
jobs and money. Out of curiosity, Moreno said, his mother went to the house. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a picture of Mexia began to emerge, painted by those who live in the 
Colonia Mariano Matamoros shantytown, home to many migrants from the interior 
of Mexico, and by those in the Riverside County town of Sun City, where Mexia 
had a home. He also lived briefly in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
Mexia, a husky, 5-foot-8, 180-pound man, moved in with Gloria Miranda in July, 
according to neighbors. She had first moved into the house a few months before. 
</P>
<P>
The home, with its brown stucco walls, pitched roof, glass windows and 
beach-ball-size satellite dish bolted above the front door, stood out from the 
others in the dusty, teeming hillside community, where most houses are little 
more than shacks with tar-paper walls and corrugated metal roofs. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Mexia moved in, word spread that he was a spiritual leader who, 
often through mediums, conducted religious cleansing rituals at the house, 
where he was building a chapel in the yard because God was coming, a neighbor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He said God was coming down because he (Mexia) had asked him to," said Isabel 
Mendez, 30, who lives nearby. "He said it was going to make this community very 
famous, and lots of reporters were going to arrive, and lots of hotels would be 
built." 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor, Daria Machado, 26, a mother of two, said there always seemed 
to be a lot of people at Mexia's house, and the religious ceremonies took place 
often, though not necessarily late into the night. It was common to see cars 
with California licenses parked around the house, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They would go inside, and you wouldn't see them anymore," Machado said. "The 
house is very closed up with curtains on the windows so you couldn't see much." 
</P>
<P>
Mexia became friendly with Rafael Corchado Meraz, 37, who operated La Costena, 
a neighborhood tortilla shop. 
</P>
<P>
Corchado, an American citizen who lived in Tijuana, became one of Mexia's 
strongest supporters, sometimes urging his customers and his workers to attend 
the rituals, which several of them did. After finishing his tortilla 
deliveries, Corchado would frequently go to Mexia's house and spend the rest of 
the day there. 
</P>
<P>
He told people in the neighborhood that the prayer meetings with Mexia would 
cure them of their bad luck, which kept them unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
That message resounded loud and clear in a barrio where people are poor and 
many had traveled a long distance from the interior of Mexico to look for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Corchado went to the house Wednesday night. He was among those found dead. 
</P>
<P>
"He would ask me if I wanted to go," said Jorge Reyes Castro, 18, who worked at 
the tortilla factory. "He said they would cure people there, and that they were 
going to see God. He said everyone would sit in a chair and close their eyes, 
and then their body would be like asleep. And that they would sleep three to 
four hours and talk to God." 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Oralia Valenzuela, 18, was among those waiting Friday outside the 
intensive care unit at the hospital to learn the condition of their brothers, 
sisters or parents. 
</P>
<P>
Oralia, whose two sisters-in-law died and whose father-in-law was in a coma, 
said she had attended a few of Mexia's sessions. 
</P>
<P>
At the first meeting, she said, she was introduced to a woman named Conchita 
who Mexia said was a medium through whom God would speak. Oralia said Conchita 
sat in an armchair and stood up as each person went up to her. 
</P>
<P>
Conchita would have the people lift their arms, turn over their palms and 
describe their problems. Oralia said she was reluctant to tell the medium 
anything. "So she looked at me and said, 'Here is the key to luck.' I looked 
down, and I saw she had pressed nothing into my hand," Conchita said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, when the deadly carbon monoxide episode began, Mexia had 
told people that a particularly powerful medium from nearby Rosarito Beach 
would be coming to the session. It's not known whether the medium arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of Mexia's in Sun City, a community of about 11,000 east of Lake 
Elsinore, said Mexia moved into a beige, Spanish-style stucco house in a new 
subdivision about two years ago from Encinitas. The house in the 28000 block of 
Calle Gaviota has been for sale for a year. It was first offered at $120,000, 
but is now on the market at $93,500. 
</P>
<P>
They knew him to be a concrete mason who did some work on his driveway and who 
at times also helped other neighbors with their concrete work. 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor, who declined to be identified, said Mexia told him that his wife 
had moved to Mexico City and that he was now living in Tijuana with another 
woman at a house he had built for about $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Hosking, who lives next door to Mexia's house in Sun City, described 
him as a quiet person, who told her landlord that "he had died and went to 
heaven twice, and that God gave him a book." 
</P>
<P>
She said he was living in the house with a woman named Martha who she thought 
was his wife, but she apparently moved out last summer with the help of family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
"He was kind of weird in odd ways," Hosking said. "He had a car with a dead 
battery, and every day he jumped it." She said she had loaned him a battery 
charger and he had it for three to four months. He used it only to start his 
car, and not to charge the battery. 
</P>
<P>
Mexia also once lived in Encinitas. A former neighbor in the 700 block of 
Snapdragon Street recalled that Mexia had a heart condition and was retired. He 
didn't seem particularly religious, at least compared to his wife, Martha, said 
Berta Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"Martha was a good friend of mine. She come up every day for coffee. She did 
(housecleaning) work in Solana Beach and Del Mar," Smith said. "They moved to 
Sun City, and we were sorry to see them go." 
</P>
<P>
Found inside the house in Tijuana were three psalmbooks, said Jaime Sam Fierro, 
a commander of the Baja California judicial police. Two of the books showed 
they were from El Templo de Mediodia -- the Midday Church -- and were dated 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
The third book was entitled "Oraciones Dadas al Sexto Sello" -- Prayers Given 
to the Sixth Seal -- which refers to apocalyptic visions of God's judgment in 
the Book of Revelation. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Gustavo Salazar, head pathologist in the Tijuana coroner's office, said the 
conclusion of carbon monoxide poisoning was based on preliminary results of six 
autopsies conducted Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Internal organs and tissues of the dead, including livers, stomachs, lungs and 
intestines, are being turned over to the San Diego County medical examiner's 
office for more detailed toxicology tests, Vazquez said. The Americans will try 
to confirm the carbon monoxide poisoning through blood tests. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the San Diego County medical examiner said his office had 
agreed to help the Mexicans. He said that, depending on the laboratory work 
done in Tijuana, it could take several days or even a few weeks to get the 
results of toxicology tests. 
</P>
<P>
The list of the dead: 
</P>
<P>
Maria Dora Hernandez Peraza, 38, and her two daughters, Blanca Sarabia 
Hernandez, 20, and Maribel Sarabia Hernandez, 15. 
</P>

CURB REJECTED ON RV RESIDENTIAL PARKING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fearing a lawsuit, the City Council this week rejected a proposal to restrict 
recreational vehicle parking on city streets. 
</P>
<P>
"This problem has been around for about 20 years," Councilman Richard Partin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It just keeps resurfacing." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gail H. Kerry requested that the city study the proposed 
restrictions to curb neighborhood parking problems. Proposals ranged from 
partial bans to a total prohibition against recreation-type vehicles parking on 
residential streets if they obstruct the vision of motorists and pedestrians at 
intersections or driveways. 
</P>
<P>
However, heeding the city attorney's warnings, the council declined to take 
action. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Jerry M. Patterson told the council that there are conflicting 
reports regarding parking prohibitions. The state attorney general's office 
"says a city can't restrict or classify vehicles differently," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, other legal opinions give cities that right. Some have already enacted 
ordinances, but these could be challenged in court, Patterson pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided to draft a formal position that will be sent to the 
California League of Cities. "Maybe we could try and guide something through 
the league," Kerry said. She asked that the council consider the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The league could pursue legislation giving cities the right to control the 
parking, Patterson said. LYNDA NATALI

COAST PANEL TO STUDY ENCROACHMENT RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Coastal Commission will review the city's beachfront 
encroachment policy during a January meeting, City Manager Robert L. Wynn said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The beachfront encroachment policy, hammered out by the City Council and city 
committees over the past year, says that residents in west Newport may extend 
private decks, patios and gardens up to 15 feet into the sand if they pay an 
annual fee to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents of the peninsula can encroach up to 7 feet into the public right 
of way. 
</P>
<P>
The final vote on the policy came after hours of public testimony about the 
encroachments. 
</P>
<P>
If the Coastal Commission approves the policy, then it will become a part of 
the city's land-use plan. If not, then the council may adapt the policy to 
address the specific concerns of the commission or start the process all over 
and draft a new policy. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to kind of wait and see how it goes," Wynn said. "Every indication 
that we've had so far is that (the policy) is going to have a 50-50 chance." 
</P>
<P>
The commission meeting, scheduled for Jan. 8-11, will be held in Marina del 
Rey. Wynn said that within the next 10 days, the city will be notified as to 
which date has been selected for the half-hour public hearing and ensuing 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
The January meeting is the city's last opportunity for the hearing to be held 
locally, since the February meeting is scheduled to be held in the Northern 
California town of Eureka. As is, some homeowner groups are arranging for buses 
to transport residents to the February meeting despite the 30-minute limitation 
for testimony on the issue. LAURA MICHAELIS

REWARD OFFERED IN TRIPLE SLAYING PUZZLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The owner of a Santa Ana apartment complex where a triple homicide occurred 2 
1/2 months ago has offered a $2,000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest and conviction of the killer, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the owner has requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred Oct. 30 as the victims, two young men and a 16-year-old 
boy, were standing next to a pay telephone in the courtyard area of Fairview 
Villas, a large complex at 811 S. Fairview St. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman had approached them from a walkway in the complex and immediately 
drew a semiautomatic pistol and began firing. 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses and police, the gunman first shot Mario David Mora, 23, 
in the forehead, then shot Noel Herrera Arroyo, 20. Angel Brito Guadarrama, 16, 
turned to run, but the gunman shot him three times in the chest. They died at 
the scene. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth man standing nearby, Miguel Angel Toledo Soto, 22, of Santa Ana, was 
also critically wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information has been asked to call Santa Ana police investigators 
Phil Lozano or Benny Rodriguez at (714) 647-5169 during weekdays 9 a.m. to 5 
p.m. or (714) 834-4802 on weekends and evenings.

MAN WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS DROWNS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 31-year-old La Habra man with multiple sclerosis drowned Friday in his 
bathtub, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Jeffrey Dale Irwin, was found by an apartment manager who was 
investigating the sound of running water, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The manager entered the apartment and found Irwin underwater, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics were called to the apartment complex in the 800 block of West La 
Habra Boulevard, and they pronounced Irwin dead at the scene about noon. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin apparently had recently been diagnosed as suffering from multiple 
sclerosis, a brain or spinal disease, which affects muscle control. He was 
being treated by doctors at UCLA Medical Center and was in the process of 
moving to a nursing home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Irwin may have fallen into the bathtub and was unable to pull 
himself out.

WATER BOARD FINALLY HAS SOLUTION TO HUGE TOXIC SPILL; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: A MILES-LONG CHEMICAL MESS UNDERNEATH IRVINE WILL BE CLEANED UP BY A 
STATE-OF-THE-ART SYSTEM. BUT THE COUNTY AND THE MARINE CORPS ARE STILL ARGUING 
OVER THE BILL.

<TEXT>
<P>
A $1.1-million system to remove a huge underground chemical spill was unveiled 
Friday by county water officials after five years of frustration, negotiation 
and costly investigations. 
</P>
<P>
The first of its kind in the nation, the ground-water cleanup system will pump 
out 1 million gallons of contaminated water a day from underneath Irvine and 
cleanse it of trichloroethylene, or TCE, a suspected cancer-causing chemical. 
</P>
<P>
The project -- which has pitted local water officials against the U.S. Marine 
Corps -- has been one of the most contentious and longest-running efforts to 
resolve a water-pollution problem in Orange County history. 
</P>
<P>
William Mills, general manager of the Orange County Water District, which has 
overseen the project, said he is relieved that the area's water supply is 
finally being protected, especially during California's long drought. 
</P>
<P>
But the water agency and state environmental agencies remain convinced that the 
money should have come from the Marine Corps, not from county water users and 
the city of Irvine. The Marines, however, remain unconvinced that their base in 
El Toro, which is on the federal Superfund list of the nation's worst toxic 
sites, is the sole source of the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
The underground spill -- which apparently stretches for three miles and is the 
largest every pinpointed in the county -- has been moving toward nearby wells 
that provide drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
The project is one of six innovative systems that the OCWD will launch by 1992 
to clean up millions of gallons of Orange County ground water contaminated by a 
variety of sources, ranging from old agricultural runoff to industrial 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
The new facility unveiled Friday in an orange grove near the corner of Irvine 
Center Drive and Jeffrey Road is pumping out the contaminated water and 
stopping it from spreading. The water will be used to irrigate Irvine 
landscaping and crops. 
</P>
<P>
The water is being removed by a well, then routed through a system using a 
technology called rotary aeration that spins the water and removes the TCE. Air 
is then blown through the system, and subjected to an ultraviolet and oxidizing 
process that converts the TCE to carbon dioxide and water. 
</P>
<P>
No other plant in the United States combines these water- and air-purifying 
technologies, according to William Salomons, a consultant for Ecolo-Flo, the 
system's designer. The new technology will probably soon be used throughout the 
nation to clean up polluted water, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the water agency planned last year to use the TCE-tainted water for 
agricultural fields without removing the chemical because it posed minimal risk 
to residents. But the Irvine City Council was adamant about removing the 
pollutant first, and the city provided OCWD $450,000 in capital and $30,000 in 
annual operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
No mention was made during Friday's ceremony about the long conflict between 
the Marine Corps and water officials, but speakers did allude vaguely to the 
years of roadblocks. 
</P>
<P>
The cleanup project has been "subject to a lot of sources of frustration," said 
Jerry Thibeault, executive officer of the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality 
Control Board, the arm of state government responsible for enforcing 
water-pollution laws. 
</P>
<P>
"This effort to identify a responsible party has been and will continue to be a 
pretty slow process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, OCWD discovered the chemical in two Irvine wells that provide 
irrigation water for crops. The wells are next to the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station, and the water quality board issued a cleanup order to the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
But several years of negotiations failed to persuade the Marine Corps to clean 
it up, so the OCWD board decided to act because it feared that the spill 
jeopardized millions of dollars' worth of Orange County's drinkable water. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Corps officials agree that the chemical leaked from the air station, but 
they maintain that there is inadequate proof that all the TCE under Irvine 
seeped from their base. TCE is a solvent that was widely used for cleaning 
engine parts until it was discovered to be a carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
Marine Col. Jack Wagner said Friday that the resolution is now in the hands of 
the federal Environmental Protection Agency.

After being without a home for the last six months, Share Our Selves quietly 
opened its doors at a new location Friday morning amid concerns that its nearly 
yearlong battle is still not over. 
</P>
<P>
"We are relieved that we're finally open," said Jean Forbath, the agency's 
founder and executive director. "But we do have some trepidations and are 
hoping that there's no organized opposition." 
</P>
<P>
The agency's opening in a business district at 1550 Superior Ave. was marked 
with excitement. But there was restraint as well. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Dickerson, who has been an SOS volunteer for 17 years, said that 
controversy surrounding the agency and its fight against former neighbors had 
taken its toll. 
</P>
<P>
"We're exhausted," she said. "The thing that bothered us most was thinking 
about where these people were going to go." 
</P>
<P>
SOS organizers say they have been working closely with new neighbors to ensure 
that the same problems do not reoccur. 
</P>
<P>
One SOS neighbor is also its tenant, Garf's, a bar and grill, which shares a 
parking lot with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
Rita Garofalo, who runs Garf's, said initially that she wasn't thrilled about 
the agency buying the one-story building next door. But Garofalo said she now 
does not have strong feelings about SOS or its clients. 
</P>
<P>
"They bought the property and now we lease from them," Garofalo said. "They're 
my landlords." 
</P>
<P>
In its old location, SOS provided service to about 5,000 people a month. When 
the agency opened its doors at 9 a.m. Friday, only about 20 people were waiting 
in line. By mid-afternoon, about 35 people were sitting in the agency's waiting 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Forbath blamed the low turnout on the lack of bilingual flyers, as well as the 
agency's hard-to-find address. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually get a lot of Hispanics," Forbath said. "But there aren't many here 
because many of the flyers were written in English." 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who made it to the opening said SOS was difficult to find because 
it is housed in a warehouse building that blends in with the rest of the 
businesses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Raidel Amieva, 32, who heard about the reopening through a social worker, said 
the agency needs a sign. 
</P>
<P>
"The street numbers run funny," he said. "That makes it pretty hard to find and 
you can't see the building from the street." 
</P>
<P>
Forbath said she realizes that SOS clients are going to have a difficult time 
in finding the agency. But she said that SOS has more pressing issues to 
overcome, such as making sure its relationship with neighbors remains solid. 
</P>
<P>
SOS volunteers have agreed to keep an eye on the parking lot to make sure it 
isn't overcrowded and that clients don't loiter. The agency has also 
distributed flyers to local businesses, explaining who it is and what it does. 
And a hot line has been set up to field community complaints, Forbath said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing everything we can to please them (neighbors)," said Dickerson, 
adding that keeping clients from loitering in the parking lot will be one key 
to keeping peace. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the opening signifies the re-emergence of SOS, organizers say they 
wanted to keep the event low-key. And they have reason to be worried. Last 
summer, the agency was driven from its previous home at 661 Hamilton St. after 
the city of Costa Mesa refused to renew its lease. Residents and merchants had 
complained that people seeking emergency food, clothing and financial help from 
the agency disrupted their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Amieva said he doesn't think clients will cause SOS any problems. He said if 
anything, businesses should thank SOS for reopening. 
</P>
<P>
"SOS helps knock down crime because now people won't have to steal as much to 
get what they need," he suggested.

Christy Joseph Dello bears Harley-Davidson no ill will. 
</P>
<P>
He can afford to be generous. An Orange County Superior Court jury last week 
ordered the motorcycle company to pay Dello $7.2 million in damages for 
fraudulently using his design for an engine exhaust system. 
</P>
<P>
The victory did not come easily, the 51-year-old Norco man said this week in an 
interview. After a 10-year fight with the company, Dello said he can now look 
back and place his experience in its proper perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no malice for Harley-Davidson," Dello said from his attorney's office 
in Corona. "They make the finest motorcycle an American would ever want to 
ride." 
</P>
<P>
Dello said his affinity for the motorcycles stems from working more than 20 
years in the machinery industry. He used his background in space aeronautics in 
1970 to open FUBAR of Anaheim, a parts shop specializing in custom bikes. 
</P>
<P>
"A customized motorcycle is an expression of your individualism," said the 
self-proclaimed "real-deal biker," which he defined as a man who "believes in 
his country, in honor . . . and rides Harley." 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes in the company's superiority in the motorcycle industry, 
and he strongly believed the same in 1980 when he said he verbally agreed with 
one of the company's former officials to be the sole supplier of a custom 
exhaust pipe he had designed. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dello testified, after he provided Harley with prototype samples and 
drawings of the system and received a $250,000 purchase order, the company took 
its business elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"They promised me an exclusive, long-term supply relationship," he said. "But, 
other than a few (purchase orders), I never received other orders. They just 
stopped. They didn't keep their promise." 
</P>
<P>
By then, Dello testified, he had taken a $300,000 loan to finance his venture 
with Harley. 
</P>
<P>
"When I didn't get another large order, I didn't have the money to pay back the 
loan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Harley-Davidson is appealing the jury awards that total $7,166,892.25. Harley's 
vice president, Tim Hoelter, said the company had assumed Dello did not value 
its business when he raised the exhaust system's wholesale prices "to at least 
the retail levels and higher." 
</P>
<P>
"When he did that, Harley-Davidson elected to take its business elsewhere," 
Hoelter said. 
</P>
<P>
Dello denied doing that during the trial and repeated his denial this week. 
</P>
<P>
Dello is a private man and is reluctant to talk about the case. But he said he 
wanted his peers in the industry to know what happened. 
</P>
<P>
After the orders abruptly halted, Dello said, he was forced to close FUBAR, 
lost his La Sierra home and in 1984 filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
His dealings with Harley were far from over, however. In 1985, while working as 
project manager for a motorcycle parts manufacturing company, he said he 
happened to see a prototype of an exhaust system resembling his design. When he 
confronted the company's owner, he discovered that companies other than Harley 
had access to his design. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, when a Superior Court jury found Harley guilty of, among other 
charges, committing fraud, Dello breathed a sigh of "great relief" and felt 
"vindicated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The trial has given me justice," he said. "Now people will find out what 
really happened to FUBAR." 
</P>
<P>
Because of Harley's appeal, Dello said he is apprehensive about the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to get on with my life again," he said. "At this time, there's 
only fishing on my mind."

Actor Burt Lancaster has been released from Los Alamitos Hospital and 
transfered to an undisclosed location, where he is undergoing extensive 
physical and speech therapy, hospital officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old Academy Award winner left the hospital Thursday, but officials 
declined to state where he went or what his condition was when he was released. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Benjamin, Lancaster's publicist, said the actor's family has requested that 
no information about his whereabouts be released. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster suffered a stroke Nov. 30 while visiting a friend at the John Douglas 
French Center for Alzheimer's disease here. 
</P>
<P>
The stroke reportedly left the onetime circus acrobat with weakness on his 
right side and some speech difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster, who starred in more than 60 movies, won an Oscar for his portrayal 
of an evangelist in "Elmer Gantry."

ROUGH START FOR U.S. IN WORLD CUP 
</P>

<P>
It's still early, of course, but the U.S. Ski Team appears to be taking a 
distressingly familiar course on the World Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the men are nowhere, and the women are almost totally dependent on one 
skier, Diann Roffe, who has apparently replaced the retired Tamara McKinney as 
the only U.S. hope for high placings against the strong Austrian, German and 
Swiss racers. 
</P>
<P>
After four men's events, the United States has six points in the men's 
standings -- four for Tommy Moe of Palmer, Alaska, and one each for Kyle 
Rasmussen of Angels Camp, Calif., and A.J. Kitt of Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Moe was 13th in a downhill at Val Gardena, Italy, Friday. Kitt, who finished 
45th last weekend at Val d'Isere, France, just a couple of days after it was 
announced that he had signed a personal representation contract with 
International Management Group, was 15th Friday to earn his first World Cup 
point. 
</P>
<P>
Kitt, 22, started this season as a solid downhill threat and a possible 
medalist in both the World Alpine Ski Championships at Saalbach-Hinterglemm, 
Austria, next month and the 1992 Winter Olympics at Albertville, France. 
</P>
<P>
The men race again today at Val Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
Roffe, 23, of Isle La Motte, Vt., is off to an excellent start with 29 points 
in four races, enough for third in the women's standings behind Austrians Petra 
Kronberger, who has 95, and Sigrid Wolf, who has 35. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't helped the U.S. cause that Kristi Terzian, who scored points in 17 
World Cup races last season, is out for the season after suffering a serious 
knee injury in October. But this only underscores the lack of depth on the 
American team. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, the women are racing in downhill, giant slalom and super-G at 
Meiringen, Switzerland, although Friday's races were canceled because of fog. 
</P>
<P>
The men, after their downhill today, will remain in Italy for a giant slalom 
Sunday at Alta Badia and a slalom Tuesday at Madonna di Campiglio. Fittingly, 
an Italian is leading the standings -- Alberto Tomba has 47 points, five more 
than runner-up Franck Piccard of France. 
</P>
<P>
An early-week storm dusted Sierra ski resorts, but only eight have enough snow 
to operate (from south to north): Mammoth Mountain, Kirkwood, Heavenly Valley, 
Alpine Meadows, Squaw Valley, Northstar, Donner Ski Ranch and Boreal. Depths 
range from 12 to 36 inches on selected slopes. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Peak at Ski Incline, on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe, is open this 
weekend only, through Sunday, pending the arrival of another storm. 
</P>
<P>
In the Southland, a trace of natural powder has been added to the base 
accumulated through snow-making at the four operational ski areas -- Mountain 
High, Snow Valley, Snow Summit and Bear Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Head, located in southern Utah, has opened for the season, reporting a 
base of 15 inches with more snow reportedly on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Five of seven lifts are running, serving about 65% of the runs on Brianhead 
Peak and Navajo Peak. 
</P>
<P>
Skiing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Taped highlights of last Saturday's World Cup men's downhill race at Val 
d'Isere, France, will be shown on Channel 7 at 3 p.m. today. The GGP 
Sports-produced program will also include freestyle skiing competition at 
Tignes, France. . . . Martina Navratilova was one of Bob Beattie's guests on 
"Subaru Ski World" Friday on ESPN. "Martina is without question one of the best 
skiers around," said Beattie, the former U.S. Ski Team coach. "I'm convinced 
that had she chosen the downhill instead of (tennis), she would have been just 
as huge a success as she is today." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Pro Tour, which took last weekend off, will stop next at Nashoba 
Valley, Mass., where races will be held for both men and women today and 
Sunday. . . . Greg Mannino of Yorba Linda, Urban Miyares of San Diego and 
Jeremiah Landreth of Brea won their divisions in National Handicapped Sports 
regional qualifying races last weekend at Breckenridge, Colo. . . . Starting 
today, United Express will offer 12 nonstop flights a week from LAX to Aspen, 
Colo., and SkyWest Airlines will have a nonstop flight each Thursday and 
Saturday from LAX to Telluride, Colo., through March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's scheduled grand opening of Bear Mountain's Big Bear Express was 
postponed until Jan. 4 because of construction delays, but the detachable quad 
chairlift should be operating for skiers by late next week, according to 
President Jerry Blann. . . . Squaw Valley's new Snow King Mountain is now fully 
open, according to chairman Alex Cushing.

<P>
POLO: THE SPORT IS UNDERGOING A RENAISSANCE IN INDIO, WHERE HALL OF FAME 
CALIBER PLAYERS WILL GATHER SUNDAY.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Polo, that ancient sport for man and horse first played in Persia more than 
2,500 years ago, is undergoing a renaissance among the date palms and 
tumbleweeds of the Coachella Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The United States Polo Assn. has been celebrating its 100th anniversary this 
year and as a climax, an all-star match of Hall of Fame caliber players -- the 
Polo Master of the Masters -- will field two teams of all 10-goal players 
Sunday at the Empire Polo Club in Indio. 
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, membership in the USPA has almost doubled, from 1,700 
members and 146 clubs in 1980 to more than 3,000 members and 266 clubs this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Empire is one of the newer clubs, having been founded in 1987 next door to 
Indio's famed Eldorado club. Empire has four full-sized fields and Eldorado has 
nine, making the desert community south of Palm Springs one of the busiest polo 
sites in the country. 
</P>
<P>
In polo, there is nothing higher than a 10-goal rating. Since 1890, only 33 
players have received 10-goal ratings. 
</P>
<P>
The teams, River Plate and Westbury, are all-star aggregations of eight 
Argentine and two Mexican players, all with 10-goal rankings. There are four 
players on each side, with two alternates. 
</P>
<P>
"It is so rare that polo has 10 players with 10 handicaps at the same time, let 
alone have them participate in a competition of this caliber," said Alexander 
Haagen III of Los Angeles, Empire Polo Club owner. "The significance of this 
event in the polo community is relatively unparalleled." 
</P>
<P>
It is only the second time that a match with all 10-goal players has been 
arranged. The other was in 1975 in Argentina and was played before 40,000 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Handicaps range from minus-two for beginners to 10 goals for the best in the 
world, based on mastery of the fundamentals, horsemanship, sense of strategy 
and conduct and quality of ponies. Anyone rated at five goals or more is 
considered a high-goal player. 
</P>
<P>
No American polo player has rated 10 since Tommy Wayman in 1983 and '84. In the 
first half of the century, the United States dominated polo the way Argentina 
does today, and there were a number of American 10-goal players, the most 
famous being Tommy Hitchcock Jr. Hitchcock was a 10 from 1922 to 1940. He was 
killed during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the starters in the game Sunday are from the wealthy Pieres and Heguy 
polo dynasties of Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
Horacio Heguy and his cousin Eduardo Heguy will play for River Plate, and 
Gonzalo Heguy, Horacio's twin, for Westbury. Another Heguy, Marcos, will be an 
alternate. Heguys represented Argentina in world championship matches as far 
back as 1966. There were two Heguys -- fathers of Horacio, Eduardo and Gonzalo 
-- in the other 40-goal game 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalo Pieres and Alfonso Pieres will also play against one another. Gonzalo 
will be captain of River Plate. Alfonso has been a 10-goal player for eight 
years and was a member of the winning World Cup team for five consecutive 
years. The Pieres brothers breed and train polo ponies and are founding members 
of the Pilar Chico Polo Club, home base for many high-goal players near Buenos 
Aires. 
</P>
<P>
The two Mexicans, Carlos and Memo Gracida, are also brothers from a traditional 
polo family. Both live in Palm Beach, Fla., where they also train polo ponies. 
</P>
<P>
"The teams are very well balanced and no one has a distinct advantage," said 
Memo Gracida, who will be captain of the Westbury four. 
</P>
<P>
Memo has had a 10-goal rating since 1980, longer than any other player. Carlos, 
who will play for River Plate, gained his 10-goal distinction in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In 1946, in an international match against the United States, the entire Mexico 
lineup was composed of Gracidas -- Gabriel, Guilliermo, Alejandro and Jose. 
</P>
<P>
The other starter for Westbury is Ernesto Trotz, another Argentine. Their 
reserve is Benjamin Araya, who attained his 10-goal rating last year in 
Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
A polo game consists of six periods, called chukkers, each lasting a little 
more than seven minutes and played on a 10-acre field, 160 yards by 300 yards, 
with goals at either end that are eight yards wide. A warning horn sounds after 
seven minutes and play continues for 30 seconds unless a goal is scored or the 
ball is knocked out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
The name polo is derived from a Tibetan word, pelu, which means ball. In the 
13th century, the Mongols carried the game to India, where six centuries later 
it was discovered by British tea planters, who turned it into a sport for 
aristocrats. Today, there are 800 clubs in 53 nations playing polo, but the 
heart of the sport is in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
Polo ponies, which are not ponies at all but usually are thoroughbred horses 
bred with quarter horses, are changed every chukker. A team of four riders 
needs a stable of 30 horses for a game. There are no timeouts or substitutions 
unless a horse or player is injured. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum height for an actual pony is 14.2 hands but most polo mounts stand 
15 to 16 hands, a "hand" being four inches. 
</P>
<P>
A top polo pony, most of which come from Argentina, can cost up to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The ball is hard plastic, 3 1/2 inches in diameter and weighing four ounces. 
Mallets are up to 54 inches long with a cigar-shaped head made of hardwood. A 
well-struck ball hit from a pony traveling at 35 m.p.h. can reach speeds of 
more than 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Arena, or indoor polo, such as has been played since 1983 at the Los Angeles 
Equestrian Center in Griffith Park, is a cut-down version of the outdoor game. 
It has three players on a side and is played on a smaller field, 150 by 300 
feet, using a softer, rubber ball and is played for only four chukkers. 
</P>
<P>
As in hockey or soccer, bumping an opponent to prevent him from controlling the 
ball is not only legal, but highly praised as a defensive tactic. The only rule 
is that the angle of collision not be more than 45 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
One of the delightful traditions in polo occurs after three chukkers -- during 
halftime -- when spectators pour onto the field and participate in a bit of 
grounds keeping that is called "divot stomping." 
</P>
<P>
It is both a necessary ritual to help smooth out the rough spots caused by the 
abrupt turning and pivoting of the horses and a social one that encourages a 
mingling of the patrons. 
</P>
<P>
In England, when Prince Charles is playing, even the Queen has been known to be 
a divot stomper. 
</P>
<P>
Many enthusiasts say that the future of the game in America lies with 
developing strong high school and college programs, which are overseen by the 
USPA's Polo Training Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
There are 26 colleges and 10 high schools with polo teams. Among them on the 
West Coast are UC Davis, which lost in the collegiate final to Colorado State; 
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Stanford, Washington State, Oregon State and the 
Robert Louis Stevenson prep school in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Polo Club was California's first, founded in 1898, two years 
before the USPA was formed to standardize rules and conduct championship 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California was a hotbed of polo activity in the 1930s and '40s when 
there were fields at the Midwick Country Club in Monterey Park and Riviera, 
Uplifters Club and Will Rogers Park in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
Cecil Smith, Elmer Boeseke and Robert Skene were all local favorites who 
attained 10-goal ratings. Skene played on national championship teams for 
Beverly Hills in 1952 and Santa Barbara in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Pedley, who captained the Midwick team that won the national championship 
in 1924, was a nine-goal player. Pedley scored a record 12 goals in 1936 when 
his United States team defeated Hurlingham of Great Britain, 20-4. 
</P>
<P>
There are 25 active clubs in the state, including ones in Santa Barbara, Rancho 
Santa Fe, Ventura and the two in Indio.

'UNSAFE' OPERATION LEADS TO CLOSURE OF FAR WESTERN BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Far Western Bank, once Orange County's biggest bank, was closed Friday by state 
banking regulators, who seized the institution as mounting losses threaten to 
wipe out its capital. 
</P>
<P>
The State Banking Department found that Far Western, which had relied almost 
totally on risky car loans, had lost $13.7 million so far this year and had 
little more than $1 million left in capital. 
</P>
<P>
"Far Western Bank is operating in an unsafe manner, which necessitates the 
closure as a protection to depositors and creditors," James E. Gilleran, state 
banking superintendent, said in a prepared statement. "The bank had no prospect 
for future success." 
</P>
<P>
The bank is the first in Orange County to be seized since New City Bank in 
Orange was closed in 1987. It is the fourth bank in the state to be seized this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Far Western is more than 50% owned by Joyce Burns. But regulators said that her 
husband, Richard L. Burns, was the power behind the throne. The Rancho Santa Fe 
businessman's ties to the bank worried regulators because of his involvement in 
two other troubled companies. 
</P>
<P>
The state agency appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as receiver, and 
the federal agency will begin on Monday to refund insured deposits to account 
holders at the bank's headquarters office, its only full-service branch. 
</P>
<P>
The bank had $142 million in deposits in 4,360 accounts at the end of November, 
the state agency said. 
</P>
<P>
About $7 million of that amount may be uninsured and won't be refunded, said 
John Holly, the FDIC's assistant managing liquidator. The FDIC insures up to 
$100,000 per account holder. 
</P>
<P>
Far Western employs 250 workers. The federal agency said it would continue to 
employ most of them for a period as it unwinds the bank's business. 
</P>
<P>
The bank's assets had sunk to $144 million, less than half its peak of $311 
million three years ago. For much of the year, it had been selling assets 
rather than making more loans. Its shareholder equity had dropped to $1.14 
million by the end of November. 
</P>
<P>
"The regulators' action was not unexpected," said Gerry Findley of Brea, a 
banking industry consultant. "Buying paper (loans) from used car dealers is a 
sure route to difficulty." 
</P>
<P>
Both Findley and regulators said there was little doubt that Burns made the key 
decisions at the bank. In addition to his wife's stock holdings, a Burns 
business associate, David Watt, had been on the bank's board. Neither the 
Burnses nor Watt could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Burns group began investing in the bank in 1986 and focused almost entirely 
on automobile loans, mostly risky loans to borrowers with poor credit. At one 
point, the bank had more than 96% of its portfolio in auto loans. 
</P>
<P>
Assets soared 17 times their original amount by the end of 1987, but during the 
same time, charge-offs for bad loans skyrocketed nearly thirtyfold. The bank 
regularly topped the list of Orange County banks with the highest ratio of bad 
loans to total loans. 
</P>
<P>
Burns, a 51-year-old high school dropout who now operates RLB Capital in Del 
Mar, is well-known in the San Diego area. He has been involved in ventures 
ranging from real estate to equipment leasing. 
</P>
<P>
He founded R.L. Burns Corp., an oil exploration and coal mining firm in 1969. 
It enjoyed explosive growth but suddenly foundered. Burns was ousted as 
chairman in the late 1970s and forced to sell his 55% interest for $14.6 
million, less than half the market value. The firm renamed itself Pyro Energy, 
relocated to Evansville, Ind., and soon returned to profitability. 
</P>
<P>
Burns then set up Nucorp Energy, a fast-growing oil and gas operation that 
collapsed in 1982. Nearly 17% of Nucorp's 1981 revenue was later determined to 
have been generated by pre-billing -- a practice of reporting as revenue sales 
orders that had been received but not yet shipped. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Burns and Watt. Watt consented to 
an order prohibiting him from violating SEC regulations in the future. Burns 
decided to fight it in court. He lost, as a federal judge found he participated 
in a "fraud on investors, potential investors, creditors and anyone else who 
relied" on Nucorp's financial statements.

Birtcher said Friday that it has joined two of the company's development teams 
to form a new group called Birtcher Business Communities, which will acquire 
and develop major real estate projects combining shops, offices and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The two teams are Birtcher Equities, headed by Baron R. and Brandon R. 
Birtcher, grandsons of the company's founder, and Birtcher Campbell Properties, 
headed by Robert M. Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
The new entity will be responsible for Southern California, Arizona, Nevada, 
Colorado and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Niguel-based developer said the two groups were combined to achieve 
greater efficiencies and not as a result of the real estate slump. 
</P>
<P>
The new group will employ the same number of people -- 75 -- as the old, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The new unit will be able to grab a larger piece of local markets and react 
more quickly to business opportunities, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
Birtcher, one of the nation's largest developers, builds offices, warehouses 
and stores across the U.S.

CHINA'S A FINE WAY TO MAKE HOLIDAY DINNERS SPECIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A long time ago, way before those little perforated cartons of cereal were 
invented, inhabitants of the civilized world sat down to their meals before 
lace-encrusted tables and gorged themselves on joints of beef with utensils 
made of silver. 
</P>
<P>
And though paper plates, Styrofoam cups, and plastic knives and forks have 
crept onto the American dining table like insects, silver is still with us. 
It's in a drawer in the buffet cabinet, about to be dusted off and polished for 
the holiday dinner party season. 
</P>
<P>
But, except maybe at this time of year, nobody entertains at home any more. 
It's easier to swallow the huge expense of reserving a table for 12 at a 
restaurant and have the staff deal with the food and the formalities, and let 
everyone (sometimes even the waiter) go home feeling gypped. 
</P>
<P>
Chalk it up to the death of the servant class, or that women spend more time 
running their careers and less time running around in the kitchen. In a perfect 
world, their husbands would do that, but they'd still probably be left with the 
job of selecting china patterns. 
</P>
<P>
"People definitely judge a household by what they see when they sit down," says 
Sarah Hanley, a manager at Villeroy and Boch whose South Coast Plaza outlet 
specializes in fine china. "It's a presentation of the host's personality." 
</P>
<P>
Hanley says setting a beautiful table doesn't have to be a lofty pursuit 
limited to the pages of a Jane Austen novel or White House state dinners. By 
shedding their grandmother's inhibitions, most people can manage to conjure the 
proper ambience for about what it cost to feed those 12 hungry people. And 
they'll score points for tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Hanley's goal is to set free the average homemaker imprisoned by wedding gift 
china so fancy she is terrified to use it. 
</P>
<P>
"People tend to be ultra-conservative when they venture out to buy china and 
silver for the first time. It doesn't have to be that way," she says. "And the 
china you use doesn't have to be made of bone, and the silver can be stainless 
steel." 
</P>
<P>
Part of Hanley's job is to administer protocol to her customers at Villeroy and 
Boch. There she finds herself carefully adopting the role of Miss Manners while 
advising her customers on the correct number of forks to use for a three-course 
meal as opposed to a five-course meal, and when and if finger bowls (a dying 
icon, at best) are necessary. All of this in a world where slamming down a 
hamburger while steering onto the San Diego Freeway is the accepted norm of 
taking a meal. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the dinner party used to serve as the primary excuse for exhibiting 
one's social status. 
</P>
<P>
"Victorian women had over 1,800 pieces of silver on the table at one time," 
says Mary Reynolds, a sales associate at South Coast Plaza's exclusive sterling 
and crystal store, Lucy Zahran Inc. Among them: a sterling lettuce fork for 
serving individual pieces of lettuce; a sterling corn scraper; a special spoon 
for pudding; an elongated spoon for reaching into canisters of horseradish -- 
maybe even a knife rest, "so they wouldn't always have to wash out those big 
linens," Reynolds says. 
</P>
<P>
But the rules for setting a table have changed somewhat to keep up with the 
microwaveable social graces of the late 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
"The trend is toward more formal entertaining," says Helen Russell, manager at 
the Lenox China Store in South Coast Plaza. "New tableware can be combined with 
family heirlooms to create an understated elegance that is nostalgic in mood." 
</P>
<P>
Hanley says you should start with the basics: white dinner plates are a good 
background, to which can be added different patterns to suit different 
occasions. Bone china is always the most formal, she says, but a good porcelain 
is also a good bet. "And don't be afraid of trim," Hanley advises. "There's 
nothing wrong with trim." 
</P>
<P>
So if that sounds like a manageable pursuit, here are the five basic pieces 
that Hanley says comprise the well-healed place setting: the basic dinner 
plate, the salad plate, a teacup and saucer, a bread and butter dish and a soup 
bowl that doubles as a cereal bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds suggests these flatware complements: dinner forks, butter knives, 
salad forks, soupspoons and teaspoons. 
</P>
<P>
Extras may include open vegetable-salad bowls (Hanley suggests keeping at least 
two on hand); a gravy boat (although gravy is a bit of a dinosaur in these 
cholesterol-conscious times); an oval or round platter (for those big 
productions, like the one you're contemplating for Christmas dinner); sandwich 
trays (for buffets); and cake plates ("cakes look nicer on a pedestal"). There 
are also butter dishes and margarine pots, egg cups, napkin rings, ad 
infinitum. 
</P>
<P>
And there are many choices when it comes to bowls. The basic soup (and cereal), 
the rimmed soup bowl, the cream soup bowl, a bowl for fruit, custard, rice and 
eggs. "Bowls can be very confusing," Hanley says. 
</P>
<P>
Even if most of your dinnerware is made up of florals or some other bold 
pattern, Hanley says pieces can always be added to change the look of your 
table, to dress it up or down. By mixing and matching colors and patterns, the 
dining table is never static, and, as the best chefs know, you'll never serve 
the same dish twice. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time you reach dessert, you'll have a whole new set," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Kennedy knew this stuff. Once when entertaining at a state dinner given 
at Mount Vernon in 1961 in honor of the president of Pakistan, she switched the 
stiff white damask linen for pale yellows and blues. How nice for her guests, 
who were charmed by the warmer tones and probably digested everything much more 
peaceably. 
</P>
<P>
"In today's fast-paced lifestyles, people treasure the moments they have to 
just sit with friends and have a good dinner," Reynolds says. "We're all tired 
of restaurants. The time we spend together is going to be quality time." 
</P>
<P>
When shopping for place settings, Hanley suggests keeping in mind the following 
rules of etiquette: the flatware is placed 1 inch from the edge of the table at 
place settings that are equidistant from each other (about 30 inches between 
centers of plates). The napkin may be placed on the plate, unless the first 
course is in place, in which case it is to the left of the forks. There should 
never be more than three utensils on each side of the plate, and always place 
the utensil that is to be used first on the outside. "You should be able to 
predict what the meal will be from your place setting," Hanley says. 
</P>
<P>
The average cost for each place setting runs between $60 and $150 at Villeroy 
and Boch (Hanley suggests buying service for eight,) and a five-piece set of 
sterling silver flatware at Lucy Zahran ranges from $200 to $1,000. "Silver is 
still the first thing a cat burglar goes for," Reynolds says, which would seem 
to make a good case for stainless steel, available at housewares stores, such 
as the Pottery Shack in Laguna Beach. They also sell less formal china, 
stemware and napkins. A five-piece set of stainless runs from $20 to about $60. 
</P>
<P>
"Most brides are doing silver-plated at around $175 for a five-piece set," 
Reynolds says. She adds that the high price of silver is based more on the 
quality of workmanship involved than its market price. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a limited amount of artisans -- most of them are old and there are 
few young people coming in to replace them," she says. In a cabinet on the 
shop's mezzanine, Reynolds points out a grouping of the French Christofle 
silver-plated flatware, consisting of more than 50 different types of utensils, 
including something called an ice cream knife. All of the forks are facing 
down, a custom that is in sync with the European habit of eating with the fork 
held in the left hand, tines pointing earthward. 
</P>
<P>
"Europeans don't eat like we do," Reynolds says. "You can't shovel your food in 
if you hold your fork that way. Try it." 
</P>
<P>
A few more guidelines on choosing place settings: 
</P>
<P>
* Be stylish and ephemeral; don't be afraid to mix and match patterns. 
</P>
<P>
* Most spills occur because plates are too small. Hanley suggests using plates 
18 inches in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
* Paper napkins are an effrontery, especially indoors. 
</P>
<P>
* White is always right. On the other hand, black is considered quite 
sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
* Remember: crystal goes with everything. And some of it is even microwaveable.

DISNEY EXEC'S UNREAL ESTATE;

NEW ENGLISH TUDOR HAS THE ILLUSION OF BEING WEATHERED

ANAHEIM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven years ago, Tony Baxter drove by a house in the hills and fell in love 
with its basic floor plan. Although he couldn't afford to buy the home, the 
then chief designer of Disneyland's Splash Mountain and Fantasyland kept its 
image in the back of his mind as he continued to channel his creative energies 
into other Disney dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, after he was promoted to vice president of design for the 
future Euro Disney Magic Kingdom outside of Paris, Baxter was ready to begin 
developing his personal vision: a house similar in concept to the one he had 
seen, but enhanced with the fanciful touches for which he is known. 
</P>
<P>
First, he purchased a 5/8-acre view parcel of land high in the Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Next, he developed a crude foam-core model to test his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
After discussing that model with designers and contractors, he spent two weeks 
building a refined quarter-inch scale edition with all the exterior minutiae -- 
from a birdhouse and weather vane to miniature people. 
</P>
<P>
Finally last year, Baxter began building the real thing -- a 3,100-square-foot 
English Tudor cottage with peaked slate roof, arched dormer windows encased in 
stone, eight gables and a turret. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a manic-depressive experience ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"I go through roles between being real excited and real depressed," said 
Baxter, 43, sitting at a desk in the garage and fielding questions from workers 
who wandered in and out. "With so many decisions to make, it's a labor of 
anxiety, not love. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd be in by summer, but it's those Disney details that take so 
long." 
</P>
<P>
Those details also cost a lot more than he had originally planned, as the 
$500,000-estimate to build the structure quickly mushroomed to almost double 
that. And it's those details that make some people think he's demented, 
including workers and friends who say the house looks like a cross between a 
German Fantasyland and Mr. Toad's residence. 
</P>
<P>
"They laughed at first," Baxter recalled. "It's hard to translate these things 
to traditional trade groups, but the model was tremendously helpful. 
</P>
<P>
"They still think I'm crazy, but with the model they see it can be done." 
</P>
<P>
The idea, Baxter said, is to create something that has "real-world integrity." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the time, expense and anxiety, it's worth it to know he's 
succeeding, he said. "It's all tricks," he explained, adding that a builder 
recently came by and remarked that the house will look a century old when 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I want -- a house that looks like it has been there forever." 
</P>
<P>
On one side of the home, a portion of the wall is peeled back, giving the 
appearance of age. All wood looks old and worn. Hand-sculpted and painstakingly 
painted pieces of cement emulate other materials and create a softened patina 
that emulates the wear of water having run down its surface for 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
Wood and cement are the building blocks of the illusion. Wood was specially 
hoed to look hand-hewn and then sandblasted. Cement was carved and treated to 
look like aged brick, wood, stone and stucco. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm used to it because when we did Fantasyland we used the same techniques," 
he said. "It's a combination of theatrical architecture done for film and the 
realization of real-world structure. The main difference is that with a film 
set, you use plaster and hemp, and if what you create rots in six months, it 
doesn't matter. In a house that has to last, you can use the same effects, but 
with a pallet of things used in traditional construction, like steel and wood." 
</P>
<P>
Although the house is just over 3,000 square feet in size, it looks much 
larger. That effect is created by reducing the scale of the upper floor, a 
technique employed for many Disneyland structures. The scale reduction also 
adds charm and a feeling of comfort, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Baxter spent many long hours studying half-timbered design, a type of old-world 
construction in which large timbers form the basis of and actually support the 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the structural system of that period," he said. "Essentially they 
took a huge oak tree, smoothed it out, set it up and filled in with loose bits 
of stone and brick. But in today's world, two things keep us from using it -- 
building codes and the cost of huge timbers." 
</P>
<P>
An important factor of his home's integrity, he stressed, is that the Cottage 
Tudor half-timbered look is carried through from the exterior to the interior 
with careful attention to reality-based principles of engineering and 
architecture. Therefore, unlike typical Tudor-style homes where pieces of wood 
are haphazardly slapped on to suggest half-timbered construction, the wood on 
Baxter's house is designed and placed where it would actually carry the 
stresses of the building. 
</P>
<P>
"You see tons of these California Tudors, just borrowing and pasting together 
forms," he said. "It might look attractive I suppose, but there's no structural 
integrity because it doesn't add up to anything and you're losing the original 
purpose of why it was done that way. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see something structurally right, there's integrity and you know it, 
so it bothers you when it's not there. If you're going to emulate a style, then 
idealize it, capture it and combine it all into some quintessential. If you 
just pick and choose bits and pieces and aren't consistent, you're not true to 
anything -- you lose worth." 
</P>
<P>
To achieve that integrity, Baxter said, the house literally had to be built 
three times. The first time was to meet contemporary building codes. The second 
time was for the half-timbered look on the exterior. Finally, the half-timbered 
facade was carried through to the interior of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Exterior materials are a combination of distressed wood, hand-troweled plaster 
and cement that is hand-sculpted then painted by veteran Disneyland scenic 
artist Steve Borowitz to simulate brickwork, rock or wood. 
</P>
<P>
Brick, said Baxter, is relatively easy to emulate, although it still has to be 
tinted to get that old-world look. But achieving a realistic rock is much 
harder. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to make rock look real," he said. "What is interesting is if 
you look at a rock, you think it's one color, say a brown rock. But look at it 
closely, and you see far more going on. That's the flaw in trying to paint 
something one color because it won't look real unless you show eight or nine 
things going on that optically blend into one color. It's all pulled together 
with stains of browns, grays and greens. You can't just paint it brown." 
</P>
<P>
Borowitz uses eight coats of paint, including three base coats plus brushed 
coats and splattered coats. 
</P>
<P>
"The trick in applying paint is so that it lands on the surface naturally," 
said Baxter, who painted samples for the artist. "The more you control the 
brush, the more contrived it looks. So you whisk, throw and splatter. You're 
out of control and the random nature of the stone is in control." 
</P>
<P>
Baxter's interest in Disney-type reality began about 35 years ago when the park 
first opened in Anaheim. He frequently rode his bike there and knew that he 
would "someday do something" with Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
At 15, he built a model of a Disneyland castle and entered it in the Orange 
County Fair. At 18, while a student majoring in theatrical design and landscape 
architecture, he went to work at the park, doing everything from scooping ice 
cream to operating rides. That training, the "school of practicality," was the 
best education one could get, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Upon graduation from college, Baxter applied and transferred to Glendale-based 
Walt Disney Imagineering as a model builder. In 1971, after installing 
attractions at Disney World in Florida, he went into the firm's design 
department and worked on Big Thunder Mountain and Journey Into Imagination at 
the Florida park, plus Fantasyland, Star Tours and Splash Mountain at Anaheim. 
He then moved from the design role to the supervisor of design for Euro 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Baxter, is senior vice president of creative development for Disneyland, 
Euro Disneyland and the new California park planned for Long Beach or Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"It's intimidating to me," said the soft-spoken Baxter of his job 
responsibilities. "I block it out. I get nervous. Where do I go from here? The 
next step is out." 
</P>
<P>
To the self-confessed workaholic, more anxious moments come at night and on 
weekends, as he plans and oversees construction of his private castle. The 
two-story house with views of Santa Ana Canyon, Palos Verdes Peninsula and, on 
clear summer nights, Disneyland fireworks, is still at least a month away from 
completion. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, workers are busy grading, following another model that Baxter created. 
This model shows the side yard, an area that will be turned into a natural 
forest with a meandering garden path on which one can get lost, he said. 
</P>
<P>
His use of existing trees, including five mature pines, a coral and an oak, is 
another trick to make the house look like it's been there a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes the house look like it's part of the land," Baxter said. "At Disney, 
I have money to move trees but here I don't. I also go to a lot of trouble to 
work with everything outside to achieve balance, to get warm vistas. To me, the 
whole sense of coming home is that everything feels right and has integrity." 
</P>
<P>
Walking to the side of the house, Baxter pointed to the portion of wall that 
appears to be disintegrating. "This was for fun," he said. "It's pure Disney. I 
wanted an area where the stucco looks so old that it's peeling off and the 
brick is showing through. The end result is it will add more heart and 
conviction to the house. It's a compliment to me when people say it looks like 
it has been here forever. With one of the walls falling off, you believe." 
</P>
<P>
In the back of the house is a sculpted cement turret that is open to the 
upstairs master bedroom. Topped with a 90-pound cast iron spire that Baxter 
found at a Paris swap meet and hauled through the streets and subways because 
no cab driver would take it, the turret is where he will read the Sunday paper, 
drink coffee, eat a bread stick and survey the view. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an architectural feature that was needed," he said. "But I've had 
castles in my blood since childhood, so I had to have it. It's an homage to my 
romantic attachment to castles." 
</P>
<P>
On the right side of the house, a massive buttressed wall on the garage 
balances and strengthens the house. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally non-conventional," he said, laughing. "When you see it in 
plywood, it looks like the house is crooked. Having the model deterred a lot of 
quizzical looks." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, sketches drawn by Baxter line the walls, acting as blueprints for 
interior details such as mantels, hearth stonework, electronic gadgetry and 
placement of interior wood that carries the half-timbered motif through from 
the outside. Baxter has made more than 100 such drawings, always trying to keep 
three or four sketches ahead of Dennis Romans, a carpenter who has been working 
night and day on the house for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a blast working on this house," Romans said. "I've never seen detail to 
this extent. Building tract houses is like factory work, but you really have to 
use your head to work with Tony." 
</P>
<P>
Downstairs, a living room with fireplace and sculpted stone hearth is open to a 
two-story library with balcony and stained-glass window that depicts Thunder 
Mountain. The dining room is an octagon and will house an octagonal table. It 
has a wood-beamed ceiling with center medallion of oak. The cozy and bright 
kitchen has a cobblestone floor and open half-timbering that rises 16 feet. 
</P>
<P>
In the media room, an English pub bar found in an Orange antique store sports 
carved heads, etched glass, oak and tile. Over the room's mantel will hang a 
painting Baxter made of his "ultimate Fantasyland," a painting he said served 
later as his inspiration for the real Fantasyland and now provides inspiration 
for the house. 
</P>
<P>
A special closet between the media room and a workroom will house all wiring 
for future security systems, lighting, appliances, television, stereo, a 
ceiling-mounted projection system and a movie screen that drops down at the 
push of a button. Theater-type sound will be worked into the walls and the 
floor is stepped so that guests will have unobstructed movie screen views. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a high-tech nut in a historic house," Baxter joked. "It's all outrageous 
things. My hobby is film and I collect laser discs like a drug. It's terrible." 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs, the master bedroom with turret has a little dormer that looks into 
the kitchen, a small patio and a fireplace with a lion centerpiece sculpted by 
Baxter one Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted a Gothic bedroom," he said. "I've always admired the Sleeping Beauty 
film of 1969, that cottage in the glen with a Tudor overlay. This is 
reminiscent of that movie." 
</P>
<P>
A den has leaded windows and leads to a second bedroom with deck and coffered 
ceiling. In one bathroom, a string sculpture on the ceiling shows how beams 
will ultimately look. Baxter sighed as he surveyed construction litter on the 
floors. "I hoped to be in here by Christmas," he said. "And after all this, 
there's no possible way I'll ever leave." 
</P>
<P>
He smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"But then again, who knows?"

Brazil and Malaysia aren't the only ones removing trees faster than they're 
replacing them; we're doing the same thing to our urban forests, area arborists 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Research by the American Forestry Assn. "shows us that cities are removing four 
trees for every one they're planting," says Tom Larson, a member of the group, 
president of Urban Forestry Consulting and founder of the nonprofit Tree 
Society of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
These are trees that we can ill afford to lose, he says. Our cities are already 
5 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than surrounding areas, according to 
association statistics, and they're predicted to heat up another 6 to 12 
degrees within the next few decades if present trends continue. 
</P>
<P>
Trees cool cities off directly by providing shade and reducing energy 
consumption for air conditioning. Indirect cooling results from trees reducing 
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. (Carbon dioxide traps heat that would 
otherwise radiate into space.) We need more trees, not fewer, Larson says. 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't mean we should all grab our shovels and go out and plant the 
biggest trees we can afford in our parkways. Putting the wrong trees in 
parkways in the first place -- whether those plantings were done by citizens or 
municipalities -- accounts in large part for the high incidence of tree removal 
that cities now face, tree experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent of the trees available in the market do not belong in public 
parkways," says Daryl Smith, superintendent of parks, trees and landscapes in 
Huntington Beach. "Their trunks get too big, and their roots are too invasive." 
</P>
<P>
If a tree is planted in an area too small for its root system, Smith says, it 
just seeks nourishment elsewhere. "The roots are attracted to the warmth of the 
soil under the sidewalk, the moisture and fertilizer in the lawn and the 
moisture and warmth in the rock and gravel under the asphalt in the street." 
</P>
<P>
When roots burrow toward these natural magnets, he says, they begin popping up 
sidewalks and breaking up curbs, leaving cities with just two options: breaking 
up the roots, which endangers the life of the tree, or taking the tree out 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"The minimum space any kind of shade tree needs to thrive is 10 feet -- and 
most of our medians aren't even that big," says Steve Holcomb, an arborist at 
Irvine-based Golden Coast Environmental Services. "That's why cities find 
themselves having to cut down mature trees every 10 to 15 years. As soon as the 
trees get big enough to provide any environmental benefit, they tear up the 
hardscape." 
</P>
<P>
Trees in cutouts fare even worse. "The average age of trees in these 
2-foot-by-2-foot cutouts -- which, personally, I think are an abomination -- is 
only seven to eight years," says Alden Kelly, arborist consultant and member of 
Street Trees Seminar, a professional association of municipal workers, 
consultants and vendors dedicated to the promotion of street trees and 
improvement of street tree management. 
</P>
<P>
"We're treating trees like big potted plants," he says. Or, as Holcomb puts it, 
"like long-term poppy beds." 
</P>
<P>
Cities have been working with the nursery industry, public utility plants and 
other concerned parties to find trees that will have a longer life span in 
restrictive parkways, without causing problems to the hardscape. But the narrow 
limit of choices under these constraints -- in Huntington Beach, for instance, 
just 10 tree species are approved -- can create other problems. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have only a few species to choose from and start building up large 
host populations, those host populations will inevitably attract insects and 
encourage them to multiply," Holcomb says. 
</P>
<P>
Ornamental pear trees, for instance, which were planted heavily in many parts 
of the county over the last eight to 10 years, are now struggling with white 
fly infestations, he says. And palm trees, another widely used choice in narrow 
parkways, are developing "some real sophisticated diseases we don't know how to 
treat." 
</P>
<P>
Pest problems are causing many cities to take a fresh look at their lists of 
street trees to see whether more can be added. Working with a committee of 
citizens, consultants and city staff people, Anaheim recently doubled its 
previous species list. 
</P>
<P>
"We had maybe 25 varieties for the entire city before," says Al Epperson, tree 
services coordinator. "And lots of single varieties in certain areas. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked in Chicago in the '60s when the Dutch elm disease struck, and we took 
out 10,000 trees a year, so I know what can happen. If you have only a few 
varieties, these diseases can wipe you out. The white fly infestation affecting 
the ash and evergreen pear is bad enough as it is." 
</P>
<P>
Eliminating parkways as they now exist would allow for more options, and that's 
exactly what arborists would like to see. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept of parkways comes from the Midwest, where snow-removal equipment 
needs space to dump snow when it clears streets without putting it on 
sidewalks," Holcomb says. "We kept the concept -- even though we don't have the 
snow -- but reduced the parkways. And just kept reducing them until now we're 
down to 18 to 20 inches in some cases." 
</P>
<P>
Holcomb would like to see these parkways in which narrow green strips separate 
roads from walkways replaced by an arrangement where walkways are right next to 
the curb: "You'd plant the tree where the sidewalk is now -- it would still 
technically be on easement -- but it would have the whole yard to root in." 
</P>
<P>
This would be healthier for trees and permit more species to be planted, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly would go further: "If I were king of the world, I'd make most streets one 
way and take out sidewalks on one side of the street. Let people go to a little 
trouble on the behalf of trees for a change." 
</P>
<P>
But these solutions, both admit, are not politically popular. "It means 
starting over," Holcomb say, "and people are reluctant to give up existing 
trees in the interim." 
</P>
<P>
Another way to increase the tree varieties in the urban forest is planting them 
somewhere besides parkways. Holcomb, for instance, would like to see trees 
planted in all those little odd-shaped plots too small to build on but large 
enough to support a substantial tree. "It would have to be a tough tree that 
could pretty much exist on its own, but there are plenty of those around." 
</P>
<P>
And Larson, with the Tree Society, would like everyone living in a private home 
to plant three trees around it. 
</P>
<P>
"If people planted three deciduous trees around their homes -- we call them 
'passive solar trees' -- energy consumption could be reduced by millions of 
megawatts," he says. "The trees would leaf out in spring and summer and shade 
the house, reducing the amount of air conditioning needed, and would lose their 
leaves in the winter, letting the heat from the sun in." 
</P>
<P>
Air-conditioning bills in the summer could be reduced up to 30%, he estimates. 
Planting trees with "some dimension and scale" whenever possible would also 
benefit the environment by cleaning the air, Larson says. 
</P>
<P>
Though all trees absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, thereby benefiting 
the environment, tall trees with sweeping canopies do this more effectively 
than such dwarf species as crape myrtle, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Larson's arguments for planting trees of consequence where appropriate should 
not be construed as lack of support for parkway trees, however. One of the Tree 
Society's functions as the regional coordinator for California Releaf is 
supporting groups of citizens who wish to help their cities plant more trees -- 
most of which will be, by necessity, in parkways. 
</P>
<P>
One such group is Releaf Anaheim. This organization -- the first of its kind in 
the county -- has the goal of planting 20,000 trees in Anaheim by the year 2000 
and is cooperating with the city's Parks and Recreation Department to meet it. 
</P>
<P>
When enough requests for trees come into the department from one area -- or can 
be combined with known vacancies -- to suggest a good candidate area for a 
community planting, the information is relayed to Releaf Anaheim. According to 
parks superintendent Jack Kudron, Releaf then contacts homeowners in the area, 
gets them and other community members -- such as Boy Scout troops or high 
school ecology classes -- involved and generally plans the event, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Actual planting is by citizens of the community, with initial training and 
supervision by city staff. 
</P>
<P>
Having planted the parkway trees themselves, citizens become more protective 
about them, Kudron says. "They water them more carefully, watch out for pests 
and just generally take more interest." 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement also has the advantage of saving the city money. Two city staff 
members worked with Releaf Anaheim to plant 15 camphor trees on Alice Street in 
the group's latest project, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"If the same two guys had planted those 15 trees, at, say, 1.5 hours per tree, 
it would have cost the city 45 man-hours," he says. "But since volunteers did 
most of the work, all the city had to provide was eight hours' labor for two 
staff members for one morning. We're going to be able to plant a lot more trees 
this way." 
</P>
<P>
He heard about a similar project at an American Forestry Assn. conference about 
a year ago, he says. (The association started Global Releaf, the parent project 
behind all the other Releaf groups.) 
</P>
<P>
Community plantings are what Larson likes to see: "I want to turn the chili 
cookouts of the '80s into the tree-plantings of the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
The society will provide the opportunities, he pledges. More plantings are 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"Call ((714) 449-7170) to find out how to participate," he urges. "We want to 
get as many people involved as we can, because we need every tree we can get."

Trees are remarkable plants, arborists say. They use carbon dioxide and produce 
oxygen, thereby helping to clean our air. They cool our buildings, reducing 
energy consumption. They provide shelter for wildlife and psychological solace 
for the human spirit. And they ask very little from us in return. Provided, 
that is, we give some forethought to what and where we plant. 
</P>
<P>
"If you define the conditions of the area where you want to plant and then 
select a tree that will thrive under those conditions, trees require very 
little maintenance," says arborist Alden Kelly, a member of Street Trees 
Seminar, a local professional association dedicated to the promotion of street 
trees and improvement of street tree management. 
</P>
<P>
These resources can help in making an informed decision: 
</P>
<P>
Street Trees Seminar: The organization has produced a chart of 65 trees 
classified by the area required for the root system. The chart includes 
information on the type of tree, shape, eventual size, soil requirements, 
growth rate, useful life span, potential problems, general availability, and 
more. It is available for $5, which includes postage and handling. Contact Al 
Remyn at (714) 532-0325. 
</P>
<P>
Tree Society of Orange County: The society offers free two-hour seminars on the 
proper selection, planting and maintenance of trees at the Fullerton Arboretum 
the first three Saturdays of every month. The society also offers presentations 
on tree-related topics at locations throughout the county. Call (714) 449-7170 
to make seminar reservations or obtain information on other events. 
</P>
<P>
University of California Cooperative Extension, Orange County: The extension 
has a library of prerecorded educational messages regarding home and garden 
concerns. Ext. 262 contains a message on planting landscape trees; Ext. 263, 
staking landscape trees; Ext. 264, training young landscape trees. The TELETIP 
line is (714) 447-7190. Call (714) 447-7150 for a complete list of messages and 
a catalogue of Extension publications, a number of which are related to trees. 
</P>
<P>
California Releaf: If you are interested in replenishing the county's urban 
forest -- beyond the borders of your own yard -- contact Genni Cross, Releaf 
coordinator for Southern California, at (714) 725-0323 for a step-by-step guide 
to organizing a Releaf Effort in your community. Guides are also available for 
municipalities wanting to get involved. SHARON COHOON

The number of gas service stations has steadily decreased over the last five 
years in Orange County. However, taxable sales at the stations during the same 
period have fluctuated, including an 11% jump in 1989. The number of service 
stations in the county and their taxable sales are detailed below.
