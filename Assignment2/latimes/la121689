In that clever parody of the Doo Dah Parade -- the Tournament of Roses version 
-- Pepsi is avoiding the wet look this time around. 
</P>
<P>
The company's last float, as a press release gently puts it, "was unable to 
parade in all of its glory." In fact, Pepsi's "Luau," which offered Polynesian 
swimmers, a 30-foot-long water flume and a waterfall, was believed to be the 
first Rose Parade float in 100 years to fail to make it to the starting line. 
</P>
<P>
Road-tested before it was filled with water, it moved gracefully. But when all 
16,000 pounds of the wet stuff were added to the 19,000-pound frame for New 
Year's Day, the "Luau" displayed all the mobility of a roasted pig. 
</P>
<P>
The "slosh factor," one official explained. 
</P>
<P>
A tow truck broke an axle trying to raise it. Another also failed. Rather than 
attempt to pull it up the parade route, the "Luau" was finally dragged 
ignominiously off onto a side street. 
</P>
<P>
Pepsi has bravely returned with a float that celebrates Dixieland jazz. 
</P>
<P>
There are no water flumes, no waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
Call it Pepsi light. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about tough assignments: The Silver Lake Merchants Assn. is holding a 
contest among John Marshall High School students to see who can best improve 
the appearance of the area parking meters. 
</P>
<P>
No hacksaws allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Florence Savage received a phone call from an anonymous male who wanted to 
confirm that she lived at such-and-such address in Studio City. Next thing she 
knew, an envelope was left outside her door, containing her lost wallet and an 
unsigned letter. 
</P>
<P>
The note said: 
</P>
<P>
"You dropped this wallet directly outside your car door on a side street off 
Ventura Blvd. I picked it up. I was broke and needed money. That is no excuse 
for stealing, I know. But I did it with the belief that I would return the 
wallet with the cash ($125) that was in it to you. It's taken much too long . . 
. but here it is. I hope somehow you can forgive me. . ." 
</P>
<P>
What stunned Savage was that she had lost the wallet three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could thank him for his holiday spirit," she said Friday. "You know 
-- he even returned 75 cents in change I had in the wallet." 
</P>
<P>
It's Beethoven's 219th birthday today, though his bronze figure in Pershing 
Square seems too lost in thought to notice. 
</P>
<P>
The statue, commissioned and paid for by members of the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic Orchestra, was dedicated in 1932 and was the sight of one of Mayor 
Frank Show's more memorable malapropisms. Shaw declared that it was wonderful 
that the city had such a splendid "sympathy" orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Marija Erika Schwepper, who calls herself "the No. 1 clairvoyant in Europe," is 
moving to L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Following Nancy Reagan, no doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Schwepper's press agent dropped off a packet of clippings at The Times and 
said, "She knows you're going to want to do a story." 
</P>
<P>
She was right. We wanted to do a story, but needed a final Only in L.A. item.

AL MARTINEZ: A TALE OF TWO WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonnie Fleming and Stella Benson aren't even remotely alike. You won't meet 
them at the same party, the same clothing store or even in the same 
supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
One is Burbank, the other Beverly Hills. One is show biz, the other workaday 
world. 
</P>
<P>
But they share a tenacity of spirit that increasingly characterizes the 
unwillingness of women to simply adorn the world in silence. 
</P>
<P>
They challenged the Establishment as sad and angry human beings and their 
efforts haven't been in vain. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Fleming is the daughter of Warren Cowan, whose Beverly Hills-based 
Rogers &amp; Cowan is probably the most influential public relations firm in 
the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
Her sister, Linda, was killed by a drunk driver who was ultimately sentenced to 
six months in jail. Without Bonnie's persistence, he wouldn't have gotten that. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, she refuses to let the misbalanced moment of crime and punishment go 
unnoticed. In show biz, you fight back with the weapons at hand. In this case, 
a movie of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Stella Benson isn't the real name of the second woman. She insists on 
anonymity, but her determination to save the home she has occupied for almost 
50 years celebrates the dignity of individual effort in a mass society. 
</P>
<P>
Stella's small stucco house, boxed in on three sides by multistoried apartment 
buildings under construction, is as clear a symbol of resistance as a bald 
eagle screaming freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming is an attractive, dark-haired woman with an intensity that drives you 
to the wall. You stand back a little when Fleming talks, wary of all the energy 
flashing through the room. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want vengeance," she said the other day, leaning across the coffee 
table of an expensive hillside home she had just purchased. "James Payne is a 
nice boy who happened to have killed my sister. He cried when he looked at her 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
"But kill her he did, and the case was almost dismissed because it was night 
and Linda was jaywalking. I couldn't let that happen. The penalty for 
jaywalking ought to be a ticket, not death." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Cowan, 43, was a gifted graphic artist whose quiet strength guided Bonnie 
through a difficult year of divorce. They were a close family, and Linda was a 
special friend. 
</P>
<P>
As Fleming followed the case, she saw an original charge of manslaughter 
reduced to drunk driving, and other factors mitigating against Payne dismissed 
as irrelevant. It was as though Linda's death itself was being labeled 
irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming hired a lawyer, built her own file on the case and went after the 
prosecuting attorney. Through sheer persistence, she at least succeeded in 
getting the maximum sentence for 26-year-old Payne, who pleaded guilty to 
driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't over," she said in a manner that left no room for debate. "I'm not 
done with the system. This was not a little case that happens every day. This 
was my sister." 
</P>
<P>
Fleming has already held discussions at a major television studio for a movie 
of the week based on the fatal accident. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the story told," she said. "I want the system exposed. I want Linda's 
death to matter." 
</P>
<P>
Stella Benson lives alone in the small stucco house, the last of her family to 
occupy it. Unmarried, she once lived there with her mother and sister, but both 
have since died. Only memories remain. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother planted that as a seedling," she said, gesturing toward an avocado 
tree that towered over us. "I'm not going to give that up." 
</P>
<P>
We were in the back yard of her house on a busy Burbank thoroughfare. Benson is 
a solid, no-nonsense woman in her 70s. She was born in Dixie and, she says, the 
rebel spirit still burns in her soul. 
</P>
<P>
In the back of her house and on either side, three-story apartment buildings 
are under construction, rising around her like prison walls. The slamming of 
hammers and the screeching of saws turn a quiet day into calamity. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my home," Benson said, "and I'm not going to give it up. The man 
building these things may have a dream about what he wants to do, but I have a 
dream, too. That dream is to stay right here." 
</P>
<P>
They offered her $225,000 for her house, she says, and she told them to go to 
hell. When they persisted, she hired a lawyer who warned them to leave her 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
I can't tell you exactly where the house is because Benson wants no publicity 
on it. That's too bad. She deserves a medal. 
</P>
<P>
But if you're driving through Burbank someday and you see a little green stucco 
house surrounded by towering apartment buildings, honk your horn for Stella 
Benson. 
</P>
<P>
And think of Bonnie Fleming, too.

Whether the prefix is super or stupor is not the problem. The misnomer is the 
word fan. If sports could speak, it would say, "With fans like you, who needs 
enemies." Superfan is anti too many things.

LIFE OF A RAM FAN HAS UPS AND DOWNS

Why am I a Ram fan? Roman Gabriel to Jack Snow. Why should I be a Dolphin fan? 
Bob Griese to Paul Warfield. Why am I a Ram fan? John Hadl to Harold Jackson. 
Why should I be a Cowboy fan? Roger Staubach to Drew Pearson. Why am I a Ram 
fan? Merlin Olsen and Fred Dryer. 
</P>
<P>
. . . And now why am I a Ram fan? Jim Everett to anybody. Why should I be a 
49er fan? Joe Montana to anybody. Why am I a Ram fan? Someday they will win a 
Super Bowl. Why should I be a 49er fan? They win Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Why am I a Ram fan? Because I love roller-coaster rides? Because I am a 
masochist? Because they are underachievers, like me? Because I've lived here so 
long I bleed L.A. smog? No. 
</P>
<P>
I love the Rams because they are the epitome of the agony and the ecstasy -- 
always so close, yet so far away. 
</P>
<P>
Remember there's always next decade.

SOCCER TEAM TAKES A LOSING ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So the U.S. soccer team is 1,500 to 1, huh? 
</P>
<P>
And we couldn't win even if we had Diego Maradona, according to Times writer 
Randy Harvey? 
</P>
<P>
And worst of all, the U.S. coach said, "We are dead ducks against Italy."? 
</P>
<P>
Well, I say that people like the coach and reporter are the heart and soul 
reason that soccer is where it is in the United States today. That kind of 
negative thinking is about losing.

FANS CAN'T TAKE MUCH MAS OF THIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why does Jim Murray even bother writing boxing articles? They are so Sugar Ray 
Leonard biased, it's nauseating. 
</P>
<P>
He recently had the audacity to claim that Leonard has ruled boxing much in the 
same way that Sugar Ray Robinson did decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson never avoided fighters in their prime (as Leonard did with Marvin 
Hagler). If a fighter ever gave Robinson anything even resembling a good fight, 
he gave them an instant rematch. He didn't wait for the pug to turn into a 
battle-scarred cadaver (as Leonard did with Hearns, and then almost lost 
anyway). 
</P>
<P>
Leonard is a feather-fisted slapper. He couldn't mark up the cut-prone Hagler, 
he couldn't floor the battle-worn Hearns with his best punches, and couldn't 
knock out Roberto Duran, an old, puffed-up lightweight.

EWING IGNITES KNICKS PAST HAWKS, 113-109 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New York Knick Coach Stu Jackson has been telling his players to get the ball 
inside to center Patrick Ewing, and it appears the team has mastered its 
lesson. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks might be good enough to contest for the championship, especially 
when the 7-foot Ewing can display his variety shooting or passing skills. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing scored 23 points and Gerald Wilkins, outplaying his more illustrious 
brother, Dominique, had 29 as the Knicks rallied for a 113-109 victory over the 
Hawks Friday night at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing and Wilkins led the Knicks' late surge that wiped out Atlanta's 
four-point lead in the closing minutes. Wilkins' three-point play gave the 
Knicks the lead for good, 104-101, with 4:24 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks were trying to win their ninth in a row at home. 
</P>
<P>
When Ewing came into the league, he was a good defensive player. But his 
offense was limited to an occasional dunk or turnaround jump shot. Now, he can 
score with a jump hook, using either hand, and has become almost impossible to 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks did manage to hold Ewing below his 29.3 average, which is second in 
the league to Chicago's Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
It was probably the most impressive win of the season for the Knicks, because 
it came on the road. The Knicks, the NBA's only unbeaten team at home (8-0), 
were 4-7 on the road. The win increased their lead in the Atlantic Division to 
two games over Boston, a loser at home to the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"The key for Patrick, " Jackson said, "is muscle. Most people don't realize 
that a weight program has made him so much stronger, physically. He's a 
monster. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I keep stressing getting the ball to Patrick is that he is 
unselfish. If they double up on him, he'll find the open man. If one man guards 
him, he'll bury the shot." 
</P>
<P>
This is Ewing's fifth season. He has been averaging 21 points until this year 
when he could reach 30. 
</P>
<P>
While Ewing is deservedly getting much of the credit, Charles Oakley continues 
to quietly grab rebounds, freeing Ewing to concentrate on his offensive game. 
In another outstanding effort, the 6-9 Oakley had 15 rebounds and scored 23 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 95, Philadelphia 88 -- Charles Barkley doesn't hesitate to criticize his 
teammates when they don't go all out, but after this game at Philadelphia, he 
should have vented his anger at himself. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley objected to a foul call by referee Steve Javie, used objectionable 
language and was ejected with more than six minutes left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Barkley was ejected for unsportsmanlike conduct regarding a comment he made," 
Javie said. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley admitted he was partly to blame. "But, even without me," he said, "we 
should be able to hold a seven-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley had 14 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 103, Indiana 98 -- It was a tough lesson for the young Pacers. They 
led the Bucks by 16 points at halftime at Indianapolis but couldn't hold off 
Milwaukee's charge. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Sikma had six of his 20 points in the final minute to lead the Bucks' 
charge. It was only the Pacers' second loss in 11 home games. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers' big first half was sparked by Chuck Person. Person finished with 23 
points, 16 rebounds and 8 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 94, Detroit 91 -- Karl Malone, John Stockton and Darrell Griffith scored 
20 of the Jazz's 23 points in the fourth quarter in a victory over the Pistons 
at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
The Pistons, upset Wednesday night by the Clippers, led, 75-71, after three 
quarters. But they scored only 16 points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Malone finished with 27 points, Stockton with 26. Joe Dumars led Detroit with 
26. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 120, Seattle 101 -- Larry Nance continues to be the good luck charm 
for the Cavaliers, but it was John Williams who took charge of this victory at 
Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, in his best scoring game, had five of his 32 points during an 11-0 
run in the fourth quarter that broke open the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers were 6-11 when Nance came off the disabled list and are 4-0 since 
he started to play. He is getting his "spring training" in games. In 24 minutes 
he wasn't much of a factor, getting five points and three rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, the 6-11 forward from Tulane, was 12 for 15 from the field and 
grabbed eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 121, Houston 96 -- These teams are firm believers in home-court 
advantage. Tuesday night at Houston the Rockets romped at home, 105-83. 
</P>
<P>
Mark West's big game sparked the Suns. He had 15 rebounds, 11 points and 
blocked five shots. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 121, Sacramento 112 -- One of the reasons Alex English is unhappy and 
has asked to be traded is that Walter Davis is getting more playing time as the 
Nuggets' shooting forward. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, reaching back to his glory days, came off the bench to score 35 points 
at Denver and lead the Nuggets to victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets have told English they won't trade him. 
</P>
<P>
Miami 95, Minnesota 84 -- Rony Seikaly scored 14 of his 20 points in the first 
half at Minneapolis to help the Heat build a big lead. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the second victory in the last 12 games for Miami, the wins coming 
against the two expansion teams. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 116, Portland 111 -- The Trail Blazers built a 19-point lead in 
the second quarter at Portland, but the Warriors charged back and easily won. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Mullin had 30 points and Rod Higgins came off the bench to score 17, 
including six in the last two minutes as the Warriors won their third game in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the Blazers' second loss in 13 home games and dropped them 1 1/2 
games behind the Lakers in the Pacific Division. DAN HAFNER

Foothill High School, a team all but beaten in the final of the La Quinta 
tournament, survived on its instincts Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
A tipped pass by Mark Wilkinson and a shoot-from-the-hip prayer at the buzzer 
by Greg Clark gave the Knights a 49-48 victory over Estancia at La Quinta High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Those two plays spoiled an otherwise solid performance by the Eagles, who 
controlled the second half despite a height disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia (4-3) appeared to have things well in hand until the final minute. The 
Eagles had the ball and a 48-47 lead with time running out. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the ball was in the hands of Augustine Heredia, the Eagles' point 
guard, who is not only sure-handed but a deadly free-throw shooter. However, 
everything fell apart quickly for Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
With 20 seconds left, Foothill's Mark Wilkinson leaped to deflect Heredia's 
pass and then recovered the loose ball. 
</P>
<P>
After a timeout, the Knights looked confused as they worked the ball around. 
Finally, with time running out, Erik Gilbertson threw up a 20-foot shot that 
wasn't even close. However, the miss fell right into the hands of Clark, who 
tossed the ball in as the buzzer went off. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know what I was doing," Clark said. "All I could think about was 
the clock. I threw it up and prayed. The next thing I knew, everyone was 
jumping on me." 
</P>
<P>
Until the last 20 seconds, Estancia had played a near-perfect half. The Eagles' 
quickness frustrated the taller Knights, who turned the ball over 14 times. 
</P>
<P>
Heredia, a senior point guard, was a particular problem for the Knights. He not 
only scored a game-high 25 points, but had eight assists and four steals. 
</P>
<P>
"You better have a very quick point guard if you're going to play against that 
kid," Foothill Coach Jim Reames said. "He nearly beat us single-handed." 
</P>
<P>
It was Heredia who sparked a 12-2 run early in the third quarter that gave the 
Eagles a 38-31 lead. He scored two baskets during the streak, including a 
three-point field goal, and had three assists. 
</P>
<P>
However, Foothill's size took its toll in the fourth quarter. Mark Wilkinson, a 
6-foot-4 forward, worked inside to score eight points to pull the Knights to 
within one, 44-43, midway through in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia tried packing its defense and dared the Knights to shoot from the 
outside. For the most part it worked, but Gilbertson (16 points) did make 
enough outside shots to loosen the defense in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Our outside shooting is very suspect," Reames said. "That's why we have to 
rely on our bulk." 
</P>
<P>
The Knights outrebounded Estancia, 40-22. Wilkinson had 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill dominated the inside in the first half, but led by only three at 
halftime, 29-26. 
</P>
<P>
In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach 90, Troy 42 -- Mustapha Abdi scored 26 points to lead 
Huntington Beach. The Oilers led, 28-4, at the end of the first quarter and 
48-14 at halftime. Scott Jahr scored 17 points and Stephen Lucas 14 for 
Huntington Beach. Richard Wesley scored 18. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Torrance 84, Cypress 76 -- Rick Robinson scored 36 points to lead Torrance.

MARINA SHOT DOWN IN SECOND HALF

<P>
San Bernardino High School spent most of the first half Friday night trying to 
find a way to shoot over Cherokee Parks, Marina's 6-foot-11 center. The 
Cardinals didn't have much luck. 
</P>
<P>
But they found all kinds of routes around and over Parks in the second half for 
a 58-56 victory against Marina in the championship semifinals of the Irvine 
World News basketball tournament at Irvine High School. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals (7-0) will meet Compton in the final at 7:30 tonight at Christ 
College Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Marina (5-3) appeared destined for the final as Parks swatted away four San 
Bernardino shots in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"We were intimidated by Parks in the first half," San Bernardino Coach Scott 
Kay said. "At halftime I told them to try to go by him instead of going over 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Guard Quan Ha found the two easiest ways to get by Parks, who finished with 18 
points, 13 rebounds and six blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
Ha made three three-pointers and scored all of his 12 points in the second 
half, including two free throws with 13 seconds remaining that gave the 
Cardinals a 58-54 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to give Quan a lot of credit," Kay said. "He's our best free-throw 
shooter (80%) but he doesn't shoot them very often because he doesn't penetrate 
and get fouled much." 
</P>
<P>
Marina Coach Steve Popovich said he was impressed by Ha's outside shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"Ha's three-pointers really loosened things up for them," Popovich said. "They 
hit a lot of tough shots in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"They turned it up in the second half. It just came down to one last bucket." 
</P>
<P>
One the Vikings couldn't get. 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino was leading, 54-52, when the Cardinals' Etdrick Bohannon missed 
a short jumper. After the ball was tipped twice, Bohannon grabbed it and laid 
it in for to give the Cardinals a 56-52 lead with 50 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the key to the game right there," Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
Popovich said another factor in the second half was Cardinal center Ray Owes, a 
6-7 junior. He scored eight of his game-high 21 points in the third quarter as 
the Cardinals turned a five-point halftime deficit into a two-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Ray was a lot more active in the second half," Kay said. "He played well 
inside and out. And our defense was much better in the second half, too." 
</P>
<P>
It was Parks' presence on defense that kept the Vikings in front early. Besides 
his four blocks, he pulled down 10 rebounds and scored 11 points as Marina 
grabbed a 28-23 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
"(Marina) really took it to us in the first half," Kay said. "It was their 
tempo and they had control of the game." 
</P>
<P>
But the Cardinals began feeding the ball to Ha early in the third quarter. He 
hit two three pointers and forced Marina to extend it's defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really not known for our three-point shooting," Kay said. "But they were 
packing it in on Ray and Quan was wide open."

Edison High School performed valiantly in Friday night's semifinals of the 
Irvine World News basketball tournament, but poor outside shooting and 
Compton's zone defense did in the Chargers, who lost, 64-61, at Woodbridge High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
Edison (5-2) had a 17-12 lead after the first quarter, but Compton (8-1) came 
back in the second, scoring seven points in a minute. The teams then struggled 
until halftime, when Edison held a 33-19 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Compton outscored Edison, 20-10, in the third quarter, mainly on the 
shooting of 6-foot-7 senior forward Calvin Curry, who made three successive 
three-pointers, and finished the quarter with a fourth. Curry made more 
three-pointers (five) than he did field goals (three) in scoring a game-high 24 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew (Curry) was a shooter," Edison Coach Jon Borchert said. "We just 
slacked off. . . That really hurts. Until he started hitting those 
(three-pointers), we could take away their inside game. But once he started. . 
. . " 
</P>
<P>
Down 49-43 at the start of the fourth quarter, Edison rallied to come within 
one point twice, but 6-10 senior Bill Martineau missed two free throws and both 
Brandon Jessie and Dan Lovelady missed outside shots with less than 30 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Jessie, a 6-4 sophomore, led Edison with 16 points and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
Edison will play Marina, which lost to San Bernardino, 58-56, in the 
semifinals, for third place at 6 tonight at Christ College in Irvine, and 
Compton will face San Bernardino in the championship game at 7:30 p.m. 
</P>

<P>
For about three quarters Friday night, the Ocean View High School girls' 
basketball team tried to force the ball inside to 6-foot-3 center Jennifer 
Sullivan during the championship game of the Savanna Runnin' Rebel tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad plan considering Sullivan, last season's most valuable player in the 
Sunset League, scored 28 points in a semifinal victory over Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
But Mission Viejo was sagging its zone all over Sullivan, almost sending the 
Seahawk guards an engraved invitation to shoot. 
</P>
<P>
For the better part of the game the invitation seemed to have been lost in the 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until Ocean View guard Alli Takido hit two three-point shots late in 
the third quarter and early in the fourth, that the Seahawks (6-0) were able to 
pull away for a 56-51 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo trailed, 34-28, but cut the deficit to 34-32 with a minute left 
in the third quarter. That's when Takido hit her first three-point shot to give 
Ocean View a 37-32 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo then outscored Ocean View, 8-4, on four baskets by Jennifer 
Rohrig to trail, 41-40, with about five minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Takido sank a three-point shot to put Ocean View ahead, 44-40, and take 
the momentum out of Mission Viejo's comeback. 
</P>
<P>
Takido knew the Ocean View guards had been having an off night right before she 
hit her first three-point shot. "I was just thinking I have to start shooting 
more. The first one was just at the buzzer and I felt good, so I just fired it 
up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"That opened it up a lot more for Tracy (Wolfe) and Jenny, and we have to do 
that because they can really pour it on when they have some room to work." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan made space for herself early with 11 rebounds, many on the offensive 
end. She scored 24 points, on 12-of-23 shooting, and blocked 10 shots, and was 
named the tournament most valuable player. Wolfe (11 points) and Takido (12 
points) also made the all-tournament team, along with Rohrig, who finished with 
24 points, and Carrie Burt (12 points) of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
In other Savanna tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Edison 46, Canyon Springs 34 -- Erika Miller scored 13 and Debbie Fischer added 
11 to lead Edison to the consolation championship. 
</P>
<P>
Redlands 62, Loara 38 -- Trina Swiontek had 21 points to lead Redlands (6-1) to 
a third-place tournament finish. Jennifer Leonard scored 22 for Loara (2-5), 
which was without center and leading scorer Traci Titus (sprained ankle). 
</P>
<P>
Savanna 65, Fullerton 49 -- Carrie Frederick scored 20 points for Savanna (5-3) 
in the fifth-place game. Jennifer Comstock led Fullerton (6-2) with 15 points.

<P>
HOT HOFMANS SEEKS HIS BIGGEST WIN

<P>
These are good times for David Hofmans. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing a year in which his horses have won, according to Today's Racing 
Digest, 42 of 155 races -- just better than 27% -- the 46-year-old trainer is 
atop the Hollywood Park standings and has a legitimate shot at the biggest 
victory of his career Sunday in the $1-million Hollywood Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
His hope, Individualist I, a 2-year-old son of Bel Bolide, overpowered his 
rivals in the Prevue on Dec. 6, prompting owner John Mabee to supplement him 
for $50,000 in Sunday's Grade I stake. 
</P>
<P>
More important, for Hofmans, all is also right with his family -- wife Susan, 
daughters Amy and Jill and son Grant, who works as his assistant trainer. 
</P>
<P>
A success in the latter half of the 1970s and early this decade, Hofmans' 
fortunes began to decline about five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
He lost clients, among them Karen and Mickey Taylor of Seattle Slew fame, and 
was reduced to just a few horses after having had as many as 40, and even gave 
some thought to pursuing another career in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"I was burned out," he said. "We all change and I was going through some hard 
times in my life. What I didn't want to do was make this an obsession. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, I didn't know how to handle it. I didn't want to make this everything 
and cast off my family. I couldn't do both, so I almost lost both. I had to 
regroup and rethink and get a lot of help with that. Now, we're back to where 
things are great on both ends. I have the best of both worlds." 
</P>
<P>
Hofmans' rejuvenation began when owner Georgia Ridder, the widow of B. J. 
Ridder, approached him toward the end of 1986 and asked him to train some of 
her thoroughbreds. 
</P>

"John Gosden also had some horses for her at the time," Hofmans said. "Mrs. 
Ridder and I got along very well, and the next year, she asked me to take over 
the rest of her horses. 
</P>
<P>
"Together, we rebuilt her racing stable. She's rebuilding her breeding 
operation and that's helped me tremendously. Allowing me to help her has 
probably enabled me to make a comeback in the business. She really had a lot of 
confidence in me. 
</P>
<P>
"Then Mr. Mabee came along and he's been supplying us with horses, good horses. 
So, with those two, my barn started to become active again and I started to 
feel refreshed. When you get down to having a few horses who aren't very good, 
then you start getting better horses coming in, it really makes it easier to 
come to work." 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Hofmans has 23 horses in his stable, a figure he feels 
comfortable with, and he has a small client base. In addition to Ridder and 
Mabee, he trains for the Legacy Ranch, George Layman and has one filly, Letters 
Of Love, for John Rasic. 
</P>
<P>
"I like my stable and I like the clients I have now," he said. "They're the 
best a guy could ask for. I train for two of the leading breeders in 
California, George sends me horses and Pete (Parrella of Legacy Ranch) has been 
a good supporter. He stayed through the bad times. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want more than 25 horses. I'm a hands-on trainer. I have to know what 
each horse is doing. If I did what I did before, I'll get back to where I was 
before -- overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
Among the horses he trains are such quality animals as Past Ages, Over the 
Pole, Cascading Gold and What Has Been. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to find a place where I could spend some time with my family and 
have a successful training career," he said. "If you look around, that's a real 
rarity in this business. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting too where business was everything. I was crazy. I had to come to 
a point where I could keep a family close and together and yet be successful 
doing this. That's the way things are working out. I'm very happy. It's good 
now." 
</P>
<P>
In a career that spans five races, Individualist I has shown his talent. In 
addition to the Prevue victory, he has two other wins and ran second in the 
B.J. Ridder at Santa Anita's Oak Tree meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"He's coming up to the race well," said Hofmans. "I would have liked to have 
had another week, but the Prevue was an easy race on him, thanks to (jockey) 
Robbie Davis. He didn't ask him much, so he came out of it fresh and really 
good. Individualist has always acted like he had some ability and he's getting 
better and stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Grand Canyon, the likely choice for the Futurity, couldn't have asked for a 
better post position. 
</P>
<P>
He drew the outside in the nine-horse lineup, which is ideal with the long run 
out of the chute and down the back side. Angel Cordero will ride Wayne Lukas' 
colt, the runner-up to Rhythm in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
Dominant Dancer, the lone filly in the race, wasn't quite so fortunate. She 
drew the rail and Eddie Delahoussaye will be aboard. The winner of the Oak Leaf 
will carry 118 pounds, three less than her male opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The other contestants include the Ron McAnally coupling of Single Dawn and 
Silver Ending, Farma Way, Talented Pirate, Phantom X. and Elikos, who was a 
surprise entrant Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The case against Roger Stein drags on. At its monthly meeting Friday, the 
California Horse Racing Board was expected to drop the charge against the 
trainer, one of whose horses allegedly tested positive for cocaine 14 months 
ago. Instead, the CHRB will soon schedule another hearing before an 
administrative law judge, which was first done almost a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an absolute joke," said Stein. "Enough is enough. My case is no 
different than the others (which were dropped in June). The CHRB is raking me 
through the mud and they don't care." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Who and Olympic Prospect will get together in the misnamed National Sprint 
Championship this afternoon. First run in 1981, the Grade III has yet to 
produce an Eclipse Award winner and was taken last year by the renowned Gallant 
Sailor. However, some top-notch sprinters have won previously -- Shanekite, 
Unpredictable, Fighting Fit and Bedside Promise, to name a few -- and Sam Who 
and Olympic Prospect are right near the top of their division. They will have 
only two opponents, Ron Bon and Order. Laffit Pincay, who rode both in their 
most recent appearances, opted for Sam Who, so Alex Solis will ride John 
Sadler's gelding. 
</P>
<P>
The $250,000 Bay Meadows Handicap will be simulcast between the sixth and 
seventh races at Hollywood Park today. The turf affair features the final 
performance of Simply Majestic, who will be retired to stud. Others set to go 
are Fair Judgment, Colway Rally, Nediym, River Master and Ten Keys.

WRITERS AND AGEISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Mary Helen Berg's "Ageism Thwarts Older Writers in Hollywood" (Dec. 
7): 
</P>
<P>
It comes as no surprise to television viewers and moviegoers that the Pepsi 
generation is now at the helm of the good ship Hollywood. Young writers and 
producers, along with their co-conspirators at the corporate level, form a Cult 
of Mediocrity concerned primarily with recycling the television of their 
sainted childhoods. 
</P>
<P>
This sad state of affairs will remain unchanged as long as young writers are 
hired instead of good writers, regardless of age. With Hollywood versions of 
Dan Quayle burdening every executive office in Hollywood there is little hope 
for the future.

MURPHY'S BUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rick Edelstein's Dec. 9 letter on a Peter Rainer article criticizing Eddie 
Murphy movies points up the need to take great care in distinguishing what is 
based on racism and what is not. 
</P>
<P>
Edelstein makes good points; but as a black who grew up in the segregated 
South, I have been unhappy with Murphy's movies, especially his recent ones. He 
has been willing to sell the stereotypes to simply make money. 
</P>
<P>
The bite of youth has not been replaced by a maturity with verve. Race now is 
just a slick cover to make a buck and generate status.

FIFTH HOLOCAUST FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Patrick Goldstein reported in his Dec. 7 article, "The Holocaust -- A Tough 
Sell for the Holidays?," distributing a Holocaust-related film poses special 
challenges during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Goldstein has added to the challenge by an oversight. There are 
not just "four films simultaneously in the market with Holocaust themes." There 
is also "Weapons of the Spirit," an award-winning, feature documentary that 
tells the story of a Christian village in France that saved 5,000 Jews from the 
Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
After runs in New York City and Los Angeles, the film is doing well in Boston, 
San Francisco and Philadelphia. It will be gradually opened in all major 
markets throughout the holidays and into the new year. (Incidentally, "Weapons 
of the Spirit" was circulating under that title long before the title of 
"Triumph of the Spirit" was announced.)

FACES . . .: STAGING A COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year ago, Raymond J. Barry submitted his play "Once in Doubt" to the Los 
Angeles Theatre Center -- and it was rejected. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought the non-sequitur scenes like me jumping on the light-bulb glass 
saying, 'I wish something exciting would happen,' wouldn't work," says the 
Obie-winning actor. "The literary critic wrote a scathing review." Undeterred, 
Barry bowed the play last January at the Cast Theatre, followed by a summer run 
at the People's Light in Pennsylvania. Suddenly, the show was hot. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the actor is front and center at LATC, performing his blacker-than-black 
comedy of romantic Angst to 320 theatergoers nightly. "I'm used to playing for 
five or six people on Thursday, 10 on Sunday and maybe 20 on Saturday -- if we 
were lucky," Barry says ruefully. "So we got into the ethic of not paying 
attention to the audience, just the work. For me, the show is very cathartic. 
You write it, perform it, purge it. It's a real strength-builder." 
</P>
<P>
So is his new acclaim. A graduate of Brown University and the Yale School of 
Drama, Barry was a member of Joe Chaikin's famed Open Theatre, knocking about 
the New York stage for 20 years. In 1985, he moved West -- and quickly started 
working in TV and film. Now comes director Oliver Stone's "Born on the Fourth 
of July" (opening next week), starring Tom Cruise as disabled Vietnam War vet 
turned war protester Ron Kovic. Barry plays his father. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear it's wonderful," he says proudly. Not that those rewards came easily. 
Reliving the painful aftermath of Vietnam took a heavy emotional toll. "I 
couldn't talk to Oliver, I couldn't talk to Tom; I became paralyzed," Barry 
says. "I think I may've done my best work in that film. But I also feel very 
exposed, very vulnerable. I'll probably wait to hear what the reviews say, then 
sneak into a theater and see it." JANICE ARKATOV

<P>
As various critics' polls inevitably strive to find what was best about the 
1980s, one rock album keeps rising to the top: the Clash's "London Calling." 
The depressing thing is, that was almost one of the best albums of the 1970s, 
coming out just a hair after the turn of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Do we have to look that far back for music that matters? Ten years later, does 
the long-defunct Clash have any heirs apparent? Who can replace those slashing 
guitars? That galvanizing energy? Those leftist politics? Those lower-strata 
accents? Those bad teeth? 
</P>
<P>
A small but growing contingent of fans is finding the spirit of the Clash 
carried on in the music of the Mekons, an acclaimed band from Leeds, England, 
that played a furiously fun, provocative show Thursday at Bogart's (and were 
scheduled for another show Friday at the Roxy). Not that there aren't sharp 
differences: Where the Clash was often terribly earnest and somewhat populist, 
the Mekons are far more cynical, slyly humorous, dryly intellectual and 
obscure. But they have the same deconstructionist instincts, and they could get 
a slam pit going just the same. 
</P>
<P>
Iconoclasts that they are, the Mekons themselves would hate to be thought of as 
carrying on in any tradition. The title of their latest album is "The Mekons 
Rock 'n' Roll," and since they do rock 'n' roll throughout it, the name can't 
be meant entirely tongue-in-cheek -- but it's pretty close to a full irony 
jacket. Like their bourgeois comrades in pop, they put rock myths up for sale, 
but only because they want to clear them out of the garage. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no sub-genre is more justifiably dreaded than the rock 'n' roll song 
about rock 'n' roll, but the Mekons pull off a whole batch of them, precisely 
because they profess not to care about it. Of course, they do, which makes 
things more interesting. The set Thursday, like the album, was kicked off with 
the song that should be called "Rock 'n' Roll" -- but is actually called 
"Memphis, Egypt" (or, as they introduced it Thursday, "Dresden") -- and much as 
the lyrics suggest rock is more despotic than liberating, the song sounds like 
an anthem just the same. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after that came "Club Mekon," which starts off with Sally Timms singing, 
"When I was just 17 sex no longer held a mystery / I saw it as a commodity, to 
be bought and sold like rock 'n' roll" -- as if everyone, even teens, takes it 
as a given that rock is sales-driven and its purveyors long bought out. 
</P>
<P>
If the Mekons have a weakness, it's that the non sequiturs in some of their 
fascinating lyrics are too rambling for the songs to shape up as cohesive 
wholes, leaving only bits and pieces of statements remaining. That obfuscation 
may be part of the game plan, if you listen to the anti-censorship "Empire of 
the Senseless," which basically espouses getting around PMRC types by going 
over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, there was no confusion of intent at Bogart's, with the 
Strummer/Jones-like power team of Jon Langford and cohort Tom Greenhalgh 
augmented right prettily by singer Timms and fiddler Susie Honeyman. Though 
that violin is a welcome holdover from different days, the experimentation of 
the last couple albums seems to have given way to a new, more straight-ahead 
Mekons who have resigned themselves to -- and resolved to rise above -- only 
rock 'n' roll, of all things. May they never "like it" as much as Mick Jagger.

KRAUS AND VAN DAM SALVAGE MET 'HOFFMANN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Offenbach's "Les Contes d'Hoffmann" has seen better days at the Metropolitan 
Opera. 
</P>
<P>
Otto Schenk's crisply fanciful staging scheme of 1982, now entrusted to Lesley 
Koenig, has lost some of its original focus and momentum. Gunther 
Schneider-Siemssen's lavish, ultra-clever sets are beginning to show signs of 
wear. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvain Cambreling, the new conductor, paces Offenbach's score with momentum 
that often exhilarates but sometimes invites frenzy. His quest for dramatic 
breadth is hampered, no doubt, by the Met's stubborn preference for the 
time-dishonored Choudens edition. 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate impact of the production now depends on who happens to be doing 
what to whom on the stage. On Thursday, Alfredo Kraus as Hoffmann happened to 
be victimized by the multiple nemesis of Jose van Dam. 
</P>
<P>
Kraus remains one of the bona-fide wonders of the operatic world. He always was 
a singer of uncanny intelligence and refinement, a singer who valued poise and 
subtle inflection as much as dazzling assaults on the vocal stratosphere. At 62 
-- repeat, 62 -- he still can offer object lessons in style, technique and, 
yes, freshness of tone. 
</P>
<P>
He never did command the most sensuous sound in the world. It never mattered. 
</P>
<P>
He always knew how to caress a phrase, how to shade a line, how to color a 
text. That mattered. 
</P>
<P>
At an age when even his younger rivals and colleagues -- you know who I mean -- 
avoid the strain and exposure of extreme high notes, Kraus actually 
interpolates unexpected Bs and Cs. What's more, he does so with nonchalant 
panache. 
</P>
<P>
As Hoffmann, he exuded charm and innocence, elegance and bravado, poetry and 
ardor. He never forced, never cheated. True, he may have taken certain rhythmic 
liberties. He may occasionally have paused to catch his breath in an odd place. 
But an artist of his caliber can write his own rules. 
</P>
<P>
He still sets the standard. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dam refused to turn the challenge of the four villains into a camping trip. 
He savored the language and actually underplayed the grotesquerie. Witty and 
only mildly sardonic, he recalled the dangerous suavity of a Martial Singher 
rather than the elemental evil of a Norman Treigle. The approach proved 
eminently valid, ultimately fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
More baritone than bass, Van Dam triumphed in moments of lyrical indulgence. It 
is difficult to recall Dappertutto's spurious aria, "Scintille, diamant," sung 
with such an insinuating legato, with such sensuous tone and such dynamic 
finesse. 
</P>
<P>
If only the others in the cast could have revealed comparable insights 
bolstered by comparable resources. Catherine Malfitano came close with her 
generally luminous yet febrile Antonia. She was counterbalanced, however, by 
Erie Mills as a squeaky-cute Olympia and Tatiana Troyanos as a blowsy-fatale 
Giulietta. Brenda Boozer, probably better seen than heard as Nicklausse, seemed 
embarrassed by the restoration of the romanza, "Vous sous l'archet fremissant." 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Laciura sketched the four servant roles in relatively broad strokes. 
Donald Kaasch, the new Spalanzani, settled for easy buffo convention. Gweneth 
Bean intoned the music of Antonia's Mother with amplitude more appropriate to 
an Erda. 
</P>
<P>
In general, there are better ways of telling Hoffmann's tales. Nevertheless, 
the Met did muster Kraus and Van Dam. One must be grateful for great favors.

BRUNO WEIL FAILS MOZART IN PHILHARMONIC DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a truism, but one that bears repeating: Putting together a program of 
masterpieces doesn't necessarily ensure success. 
</P>
<P>
For instance: Bruno Weil, making his West Coast debut with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic this week, arranged a wonderful agenda that could have thrilled 
the faithful and proved attractive to inexperienced concert-goers. It is a 
handsome and cogent Mozart program consisting of the Overture to "Don 
Giovanni," the Piano Concerto in E-flat, K. 271, and the "Linz" Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
At the first of four performances Thursday night in the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion of the Music Center, this program quite exposed Weil -- a 40-year-old 
West German who has served as an assistant to the late Herbert von Karajan and 
as a provincial music director in his native country -- as a conductor of 
little depth, pedestrian musical aspirations and apparently small achievement. 
</P>
<P>
He simply failed to bring this great music to life. 
</P>
<P>
In that failure, he was assisted minimally by the sometimes helpful 
Philharmonic players, who, when interested, can make an inept Mozartean seem 
better (i.e., more commanding) than he is. Without in any way sabotaging Weil's 
efforts, the players merely gave him what his podium manner demanded: routine, 
pleasant, inattentive Mozart. The worst kind. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that the "Giovanni" overture ought to put the fear of God (or 
whatever) into the listener from the opening D-minor chord, and assert its 
seriousness in every subsequent bar. Forget that the Symphony No. 36 contains 
moments of stunning beauty, wondrous wit and sunny good humor. Ignore the 
seraphic youthfulness, the outpouring of melodies, the buoyancy in the Fifth 
Piano Concerto. None of these qualities ever materialized in Weil's earthbound 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
And the soloist of the evening, the Finnish pianist, Olli Mustonen, added 
nothing material to our love of Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
Making his third Philharmonic appearance -- his Grieg Concerto was clunky and 
inept, his Ravel Concerto merely promising -- the 22-year-old musician looked 
awkward, often sounded inaudible and made a pipsqueak impression in this 
cherishable and important assignment. DANIEL CARIAGA

SANTA FE IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This year's touring contingent from the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival blew 
into Royce Hall at UCLA on Thursday with a typically wide-ranging program and a 
sterling lineup of artists: violinist Daniel Phillips (replacing the indisposed 
Joseph Swensen), cellist Marcy Rosen, flutist Ransom Wilson, pianist Jeffrey 
Swann and tenor Robert White. 
</P>
<P>
White opened the concert by bringing his sweet, fragile tenor and canny 
musicality to bear on eight of Beethoven's British folk song arrangements, 
deftly accompanied by the ensemble, after which the stage was set with 
paraphernalia, including microphones, blue lights and yards of wiring, that 
might be considered alien to a "serious" chamber music concert. 
</P>
<P>
But this was, in a sense, ever-enterprising Santa Fe, and the music was the 
1971 "Vox Balaenae" (Voice of the Whale) by the non-avant-gardist's one-time 
favorite avant-gardist, George Crumb. The 20-odd minute piece is performed by 
three players wearing black half-masks. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to snigger at the composer's spacey verbal program, and there were a 
few titters from the audience when the masked players -- Wilson, Rosen, Swann 
-- entered. There was a bit of shifting in seats, too, when Wilson began to 
sing humpback whale-type songs into his flute. 
</P>
<P>
Still, "Vox Balaenae" remains an intriguing study in timbres that, with its 
mistily East Indian languidity, soothes rather than grates. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's more conventional offerings were Dvorak's Four Romantic Pieces, 
heroically projected by Phillips and Swann, and a relentless, grandly 
rhetorical reading by Swann, Phillips and Rosen of Smetana's doom-laden Trio in

CHILLING DESCENT INTO MADNESS IN 'WALLPAPER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "The Yellow Wallpaper," a stifling turn-of-the-century marriage and the 
wife's descent into madness unfolds with a languid chill. The program airs 
under the "Masterpiece Theatre" banner Sunday -- at 9 p.m. on Channels 28 and 
15, at 8 p.m. on Channels 50 and 24. 
</P>
<P>
The story is adapted from an obscure but classic autobiographical novella by 
long-forgotten, turn-of-the century American writer, reformer and crusader 
Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Her tale, ahead of its time in its exploration of 
sexual politics, mirrors the torpor of an imaginative young wife whose husband 
treats her like a Dresden doll. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this story (from 1892, when most publishers wouldn't touch it) unfolds 
like the worst-case scenario of Ibsen's "A Doll's House" -- or what might have 
happened to Nora if she hadn't managed to flee her obtuse husband and similar 
toy-like marriage. 
</P>
<P>
The wife in the psychological horror story (a heightened version of Gilman's 
own marriage at the time) is suffering oppressive fears induced by her 
hyperactive imagination, boredom and virtual domestic incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
The lazy mood of the production's painterly compositions and writer Maggie 
Wadey's faithful adaptation hints without histrionics at the enveloping 
madness. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the wife's musings and her silences serve to better highlight her 
infrequent outbursts. Beware that the tone is so languorous it may drive some 
impatient viewers to examine their own wallpaper. But actress Julia Watson in 
her high-neck gowns nicely suggests the tension adrift in the quiet mansion and 
especially in her attic bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
What the production succeeds at is visualizing the wife's fantasies as she lies 
staring into the intricate patterns of her sickly yellow wallpaper. In a 
blood-freezing conclusion, with the husband (Stephen Dillon) battering at the 
door and the wife ripping at the wallpaper, she fades in and out of the wall 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
The sequence, with the now-crazed woman embracing her own becalmed persona, is 
eerily and inventively staged by former TV commercial director John Clive, 
making his TV drama debut. 
</P>
<P>
(Gilman, suffering from cancer and judging herself no longer of any use to 
society, took chloroform and took her own life at her home in Pasadena in 1935 
at the age of 75. "The Yellow Wallpaper" is published by the Feminist Press of 
the City University of New York.) RAY LOYND

KTLA PROFILE OF THE FOSTER CARE CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Do we really care about our children? Tune in Sunday to KTLA's stunning 
dissection of the foster care crisis in Southern California before you answer. 
</P>
<P>
"What Are We Doing to Our Children?," hosted by Susan Dey ("L.A. Law") at 8 
p.m. on Channel 5, offers a stunning indictment of a grossly unwieldy 
bureaucratic system that often victimizes victims, joining the abuse cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers go with police officers in investigations of child abuse. A 7-month-old 
infant with apparent cigarette burns is brought to the hospital, but there's 
"not enough hard evidence" to take the child into protective custody. 
</P>
<P>
Older children are heard from, many of whom have trouble with the law after 
disorienting stays in 20, 30 or even 70 foster homes. They wonder why they were 
removed from their home, when the rest of the family, even the abuser, was 
free. They feel punished and worthless. 
</P>
<P>
Multiply them by thousands of troubled children. A recent congressional report 
says there are 500,000 children in "out-of-home placement," a figure expected 
to increase "dramatically" in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's going to adopt these children?" asks one angry official. "Are there long 
lines of people waiting to adopt (them)?" 
</P>
<P>
"We are creating a generation . . . who are going to turn on all of us, because 
life and human beings don't have any meaning to them," predicts Helen Kleinberg 
of the Children's Services Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Blame is laid on lack of funding and unsuitable use of existing funds. A few 
therapeutic programs seem to be making a difference, but they can accommodate 
only a fraction of those in need. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just the system that needs changing, says this explicit 
Moses/Buckhantz production. We must question the attitudes that feed that 
system. One challenging conclusion: "Our society does not value children."

The Rev. James Lawson is one of dozens of clergy, religious workers and other 
protesters arrested for blocking the entrance to the Los Angeles Federal 
Building in weekly non-violent protests over U.S. military aid to El Salvador. 
On Wednesday, for instance, Lawson was arrested along with 62 others, including 
actors Martin Sheen and Ed Asner, in the protest prompted by the killings and 
persecution during the civil war in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Lawson, pastor of Holman United Methodist Church in Los Angeles, brings 
distinctive credentials for church-related civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Lawson was in Memphis to receive the National Conference of 
Christian and Jews' second annual Human Rights Award. The citation recalled 
Lawson's roles as activist and strategist in the early civil rights movement 
led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. King was assassinated in Memphis in 1968 
when he was there to lend support to that city's sanitation workers' strike, a 
protest led by Lawson, then a Memphis pastor. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson, who has pastored the 2,700-member Holman church since 1974, has been 
president of the Los Angeles chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference for the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has been involved locally in social issues and participated in 
anti-aparthied protests, Lawson had not been arrested in Southern California 
for nonviolent protests until the current furor by American church leaders over 
continued U.S. aid to El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we need to try to arouse the consciousness of this country that our 
tax dollars are persecuting church workers in Central America, that American 
public policy is engaged in killing of sisters and brothers of our faith," he 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-backed government in Central America has claimed that rebel forces are 
receiving aid and comfort from churches and religious relief agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"Irrespective of what the rebel group may represent . . . Catholic parishes, 
Lutherans, Baptists, Episcopal lay workers and others trying to organize 
themselves for their own well-being are the primary targets -- apparently of 
the death squads and the military," Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
His fourth arrest on Wednesday was the most painful, Lawson said. At each 
demonstration, police have booked the protesters and given them citations to 
either appear in court or pay a fine. "I was in handcuffs this time from 9 a.m. 
to nearly 3 p.m. It was very painful . . . (but) it was a good experience," 
Lawson said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson said organizers, including Jesuit Father Gregory Boyle, plan to continue 
the protests, except for Dec. 27, each Wednesday morning into January. "Our 
numbers are increasing," said Boyle, who said he hoped "that 1,000 people (will 
come) to shut this building down." 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles invited more than 350 needy children 
to the annual Archbishop's Christmas Party to be held at 10 a.m. today at 
Filmland Center in Culver City. The co-hosts for the charity event are actress 
Cindy Williams, well-known for her role on the "Laverne and Shirley" TV series, 
and Lynne Stewart of "Pee Wee's Playhouse." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Clifton King, 65, pastor of the Encino Community Church for the last 
12 years and an unconventional minister who made visitations on a motorcycle, 
will retire from the ministry by year's end to take a position with a 
management training company, said a spokeswoman for the 350-family, independent 
congregation. The Rev. Edward Keebler, most recently an Army chaplain, will 
succeed King. 
</P>
<P>
MAILINGS 
</P>
<P>
Don't get too excited if you receive a letter from the "American Christian 
Leadership Council" in Atlanta that begins: "Congratulations! You have been 
nominated to be honored in the 1989 edition of Who's Who in American Christian 
Leadership." Such a letter was addressed not long ago to "L. A. Times," and it 
began, "Good Morning L: Congratulations! You have been nominated to be honored 
in. . . ." JOHN DART

BOB GREENE: SCORE THIS ONE AS A STRIKEOUT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe it's simply that I no longer understand baseball. I used to; when I was a 
kid, I seemed to know quite a bit about baseball. Maybe I've just gotten stupid 
when it comes to baseball. That's the only logical explanation. 
</P>
<P>
What brought this to mind was a newspaper story reporting that one Mark 
Langston had become the highest-paid player in the history of baseball. 
Langston, a left-handed pitcher, had signed a five-year contract with the 
California Angels for $16 million. No other player has ever received a total 
package of $16 million before. 
</P>
<P>
The story was filled with dollar figures, and there was a nice quote from Mark 
Langston's agent, and then finally -- in the next-to-last paragraph -- was the 
one piece of information I had been looking for: 
</P>
<P>
Langston's record last year was 16-14. 
</P>
<P>
I thought that might be a typo. A pitcher has a season in which he wins 16 
games and loses 14, and he becomes the highest-paid player in the history of 
baseball? 
</P>
<P>
I did some research. Mark Langston, the highest-paid player in the history of 
baseball, has never had a season in which he won 20 games. The season before 
last, Langston had a record of 15-11. Two years before that, he was 12-14. In 
'85, he was 7-14. His career record is 86-76. The highest-paid player in the 
history of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
I called a friend whom I consider a true baseball expert. His name is Rob 
Fleder; he is former articles editor for Sports Illustrated, and now is 
executive editor of The National, the soon-to-debut sports daily. Basically 
Fleder told me that, yes, I was stupid. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a case where the records lie," Fleder said. "Mark Langston has played 
most of his career for the Seattle Mariners, a terrible baseball team. You 
can't judge Langston's skills by his won-loss record." 
</P>
<P>
That seems to make sense -- at least a little sense. Certainly if Langston has 
spent most of his career with a bad team, it figures that he might not have won 
as many games as he might have with a good team. Still, though . . . a player 
whose lifetime record is 86-76, a player coming off a 16-14 season, getting the 
biggest contract in history? 
</P>
<P>
"He's really pretty good," Fleder said. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure he is. Ted Williams was pretty good, too; many say he was the best 
hitter who ever played baseball. In 1941, the year that Williams hit .406, he 
was just coming off a contract that paid him $10,000 a year. That's not so 
important, though -- $10,000 in 1941 meant something different. What is 
important is what happened much later, in 1959. Williams, for the first time in 
his baseball career, was having a bad year. For the first time ever, Williams 
hit below .300. The Boston Red Sox, knowing how valuable he had been to the 
team and the city, offered him a raise for the next year -- a salary of 
$125,000, which would have been his highest salary ever. Williams turned it 
down. He wanted less. He said he had not performed well, and he demanded a pay 
cut. He got it. The Red Sox paid him $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston (16-14), the highest-paid player in the history of baseball, will 
make $3.2 million a year. "The thing you've got to remember," Rob Fleder said, 
"is that Langston's timing was perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Fleder was not referring to Langston's timing on the pitcher's mound. He was 
referring to the fact that CBS television has just signed a $1.1-billion, 
four-year deal to broadcast Major League baseball. This TV deal has made 
baseball's owners incredibly wealthy before they sell a single ticket -- so 
wealthy that they can afford to make Mark Langston (16-14, 86-76 lifetime) the 
highest-paid player in the history of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"Then it really all comes down to Kim LeMasters, doesn't it?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, it does," Rob Fleder said. 
</P>
<P>
Kim LeMasters is the CBS entertainment executive who resigned recently because 
he had a bad streak of luck in choosing the shows on CBS' prime-time schedule. 
Because of Kim LeMasters' losing streak, CBS has been finishing last in the 
ratings. Because CBS has been finishing last, it needed a symbolic programming 
stroke in an attempt to turn the network around. Because CBS needed the 
symbolic programming stroke, it swallowed hard and paid $1.1 billion for the 
rights to telecast baseball. Because it paid the $1.1 billion, the California 
Angels could afford to hire Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
Kim LeMasters may be temporarily out of work, but thanks to him Mark Langston 
(16-14, 86-76 lifetime) is the highest-paid player in the history of baseball 
-- a sport about which I am stupid. Was Ted Williams stupid, too?

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: WRITERS LIST CHOICE GIFTS FOR READERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS MCLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Complete Phantom of the Opera," Julia Child's "The Way to Cook" and 
Umberto Eco's new novel, "Foucault's Pendulum," are among the biggest sellers 
in Orange County bookstores this holiday season, the busiest time of the year 
for booksellers. 
</P>
<P>
And what books are members of Orange County's writing community buying as gifts 
this year? Here's a sampling: 
</P>
<P>
Robert Ray ("Merry Christmas, Murdock") of Irvine: "I'm giving Natalie 
Goldberg's book, 'Writing Down the Bones' (Shambhala; $8.95). It's 10-minute 
(writing) exercises. It's a Zen approach to writing and it really works. My 
students do it and get a lot of action out of it. If you want to be a writer 
you've got to practice." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth George ("Payment in Blood") of Huntington Beach: "One thing I'm 
giving to several people is Jo-Ann Mapson's "Fault Line" (Pacific Writers 
Press; $11.95). I like the way Jo-Ann writes about everyday life but in a 
manner that elevates the ordinary and makes it extraordinary. Another thing I'm 
giving is John Le Carre's 'Russia House' (Knopf; $19.95). I like just about 
everything about John Le Carre. I think he is just one of the most highly 
skilled writers going today. With that particular book, however, I really 
enjoyed the characters. He draws characters exceptionally well and with very 
limited and disciplined use of words." 
</P>
<P>
Maxine O'Callaghan ("Hit and Run") of Mission Viejo: "I just finished the new 
'Poodle Springs' by Robert B. Parker and Raymond Chandler and that's kind of 
good. I might get that for somebody. And there's a new book I'm thinking about 
getting for a friend of mine. It's called 'David Lean' (by Stephen Silverman; 
Abrams; $39.95). It's really a neat book. It tells a lot about his life and has 
a lot of photographs of the movies he's done and talks about the production (of 
his movies)." 
</P>
<P>
Dean Koontz (whose new thriller "The Bad Place" (G.P. Putnam's; $19.95) will be 
out in January) of Orange: "I've been so tangled up in things I've been 
completely out of the shopping thing. But there's a wonderful gift book out 
there, come to think of it. It's 'Hollywood's Golden Year, 1939' by Ted Sennett 
(St. Martin's Press; $29.95). It's really about all the great movies that were 
made in 1939. It was an exceptional year -- it was the year of 'Gone With the 
Wind,' 'The Wizard of Oz,' 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,' 'Stagecoach,' 'Gunga 
Din,' 'Wuthering Heights' . . . I mean when you look at the number of movies, 
it's just staggering. It's probably the most fascinating film book I've seen in 
a long, long time. I've been reading that myself and it's a terrific thing to 
give to anyone interested in the movies." 
</P>
<P>
T. Jefferson Parker ("Little Saigon") of Laguna Beach: "I'm going to give away 
a bunch of copies of 'Keep the Change' by Thomas McGuane (Houghton Mifflin; 
$18.95). It's just a sublime little novel. I'm going to give away some copies 
of Jo-Ann Mapson's first book, ("Fault Line"). They're just real solid short 
stories, and they're pretty close to the bone. I like that. I'm giving my dad a 
copy of 'Jane's Encyclopedia of Aviation' (Portland House; $95). He was in the 
Air Force and always kept up on aviation developments. There are a lot of 
photos, capsule histories of different airplanes and different developments." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Muir ("The Midnight Admirals") of Newport Beach: "One I want to give out 
is an Amelia Earhart biography, 'The Sound of Wings' by Mary S. Lovell (St. 
Martin's Press; $22.95). I'm terrible about books -- I always give books that 
reflect my own tastes. I read the review on it and it looked good. The other 
one I want to give is a collection of short stories by Yukio Mishima, the great 
Japanese novelist. It's called 'Acts of Worship' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux; 
17.95). The reason I'm doing that -- and maybe I can borrow it back -- is I'm 
doing research on Japan for a future novel." 
</P>
<P>
A.E. Maxwell (Ann and Evan Maxwell) ("The Art of Survival") of Laguna Niguel: 
</P>
<P>
Evan: "We often tend to give picture books and things like that. Books are so 
marvelous because they can mesh so well with personalities. We just bought a 
travel book published in 1905, 'The English Lakes' by A. Heaton Cooper and W.T. 
Palmer (MacMillan Co.), with hand-tinted plates of landscapes from the English 
Lake Country. It's for a friend of ours who is fond of vacationing in the Lake 
Country. It's a perfect match. I found it at a place called the Book Baron in 
Anaheim. It's a big used-book supermarket. That's the joy of used books: 
Sometimes you can find extraordinary things which mesh with a particular 
individual." 
</P>
<P>
Ann: "I'd give anything by John McPhee, but specifically 'The Control of 
Nature,' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux; $17.95). It's three long essays about 
man's ridiculous and sublime efforts to control everything from the Mississippi 
to the erosion of the San Gabriel Mountains. Another is a cookbook -- but it's 
more than a cookbook -- by Jane Watson Hopping: 'The Pioneer Lady's Country 
Christmas" (Villard; $18.95). The subheading is 'a gift of old-fashioned 
recipes and memories of Christmas Past,' and I have to say it was truly like 
being a grandchild in my grandmother's kitchen again. It's quite a trip." 
</P>
<P>
Her short stories have been praised by her writing peers for extracting "the 
living moment from ordinary scenes" and for creating "a beguiling blend of 
vulnerability, humor and strength." 
</P>
<P>
The 15 short stories in Costa Mesa author Jo-Ann Mapson's first published 
collection, "Fault Line" (Pacific Writers Press; $11.95), reflect the 1986 
California Short Story Competition winner's continuing exploration into the 
lives of ordinary people. 
</P>
<P>
Mapson, 37, said the recurring themes in all of her work are "hope, betrayal 
and survival. I guess I'm sort of humanistic and I believe there is hope even 
with the greenhouse effect and the Irvine Co. looming on the horizon ready to 
subdivide us all." 
</P>
<P>
Mapson, a member of the Orange County writer's group Fictionaires, said she 
wrote her first short story in the sixth grade and has been writing "seriously" 
since she was 21. But it wasn't until 1985 that she began "sending things out 
on a weekly basis, working on a novel -- just being very committed to my 
craft." 
</P>
<P>
An agent is currently circulating Mapson's finished novel, a story that takes 
place in Balboa and follows three generations of the same family. "I hope that 
I can go to writing novels full time, but I'll never abandon the short stories. 
I've written about six this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the short story form is really an art form," said Mapson. "In a novel 
you have 300 pages to make a reader fall in love with you. You can flirt in a 
novel -- you can tease the reader this way and that way and keep them 
intrigued. But in a short story you stand alone. You have to capture the reader 
with the very first sentence, deliver the goods in a tantalizing manner and end 
with a perfect 10 -- or the reader will put you down." 
</P>
<P>
Mapson, who is taking Richard Linder's short story writing class at Orange 
Coast College, will begin working on her master's degree in writing later this 
month at Vermont College, where she will attend part of the year and also do 
course work by mail with a faculty adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Mapson said her friend, Laguna Beach writer Cynthia Farley, "cajoled" her into 
submitting the "Fault Line" manuscript to Pacific Writers Press, a small, UC 
Irvine-based independent publisher, which has printed 2,000 copies of her book. 
Another friend, mystery writer Elizabeth George, wrote the introduction. "Fault 
Line" is available at Upchurch-Brown Booksellers in Laguna Beach, Courtyard 
Books in Tustin and the bookstores at UC Irvine and Irvine Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
Mapson's husband, Stewart Allison, designed the book's cover, which features a 
grainy photograph of a man's and a woman's hands. Trivia fans take note: The 
hands belong to Mapson's fellow Fictionaires members, Farley and T. Jefferson 
Parker. 
</P>
<P>
Book signings: Jocelyn Christopher will sign "Private Dancers" from 11 a.m. to

The number of alcohol-related fatal accidents in Orange County cities during 
1988 was the lowest recorded during any of the last five years. The 104 
accidents were a 7% decrease from 1987. Anaheim had by far the most such 
accidents, 27. In fact, that is the highest total for any city during the 
five-year span. Several cities had none of these accidents; La Palma and Los 
Alamitos have had none during the five years. The Highway Patrol defines 
alcohol-related accidents as any where a driver, pedestrian or bicyclist had 
been drinking.

ALCOHOL-RELATED FATAL ACCIDENTS 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol-related fatal accidents in Orange County dropped to their lowest level 
in six years during 1988. The 124 incidents marked a 13% decrease from the 
previous year and the second lowest level recorded since 1979. Only 1982 was a 
better year during the last decade, with just 114 such accidents. These numbers 
include accidents not only on city streets but on state highways within the 
county and county roads as well.

The number of county residents killed in alcohol-related traffic accidents 
dropped 19% between 1987 and 1988. The 134 fatalities last year was by far the 
lowest number during any of the last five years and the lowest for the 
preceding decade except for the 121 recorded in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim was by far the deadliest city, with twice as many alcohol-related 
deaths as Santa Ana (which had the second highest total). Anaheim's total of 
killed and injured, however, was 63% lower than Santa Ana, which had the 
highest combined total of killed and injured. Santa Ana's combined 898 killed 
and injured accounted for 19% of the total for cities' streets.

BIG BEN, LONDON'S HEART SKIP BEAT

The four clock faces on Big Ben clanked to a halt for three hours Friday, and 
London's heart seemed to skip a beat. 
</P>
<P>
The government agency that services Big Ben and other state buildings 
throughout the country said the clock stopped at 11:07 a.m. and was out of 
action until about 2:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Property Services Agency, speaking anonymously, said the 
cogs that advance the clock's hands were unable to turn even though the 
pendulum continued to swing. She could not explain what caused the malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
Big Ben is the name of the 13 1/2-ton bell, which chimes out the hours from 
behind the clock faces. 
</P>
<P>
Stoppages are rare for the giant 131-year-old clock tower, which has survived 
pollution, foul weather and war. The British Broadcasting Corp. uses the chimes 
to introduce its 6 p.m. and midnight newscasts, taking the sound live by 
microphone from the tower. Its other newscasts use the atomic clock at 
Greenwich.

This year's flu season may peak in January, earlier than it did last year, but 
there is no evidence that it will be abnormally bad, an influenza specialist at 
the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said. "From the evidence we 
have, it's a normal flu. What many people don't realize is that normal flu 
kills," said Dr. Lawrence Schonberger. He said the Type A, or Shanghai, flu had 
been expected, and it has been showing up across the country. Schonberger said 
flu shots should have been received in November but that they still can be 
effective now. It takes about two weeks after vaccination for the treatment to 
reach its fullest effect.

The Internal Revenue Service, selling off vintage cars seized in drug cases, 
netted $157,800 in an auction Thursday that drew 1,000 potential bidders and 
will help compensate the agency for unpaid taxes. Many of the prized 
automobiles were confiscated in drug seizures. Seven of the cars belonged to 
Rudy Henderson, a millionaire imprisoned on drug charges. One of the seven 
vehicles included a 1968 Chevrolet Corvette that went for $24,500, the highest 
of the sale. Henderson has an unpaid tax bill of $512,000 and the sale of his 
seven cars came to $96,900, the IRS said.

Fresno County residents don't eat as many of the fruits and vegetables grown in 
their region as residents of San Francisco and Los Angeles, according to a new 
state survey. Twenty-six percent of the 252 Fresno County residents polled 
between August and November said they are not in the habit of eating fresh 
produce and 38% say they don't believe there is a link between diet and 
disease. "I think people can be aware of agriculture in Fresno County but not 
be aware of the role fruits and vegetables play in personal health," said Karen 
Bunch, a research director for the Nutrition and Cancer Prevention Program, 
which funded the survey.

HEALTH CARE FOR POOR IS EXPECTED TO KEEP SLIPPING; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: HIGHER-THAN- AVERAGE PERCENTAGE OF UNINSURED PATIENTS IS PUTTING 
INCREASING FINANCIAL BURDEN ON SAN DIEGO HOSPITALS, A STUDY FINDS. 
</P>

<P>
Without immediate structural changes, San Diego's health-care system will 
increasingly fail to meet the needs of the county's growing body of poor and 
indigent residents, according to a "report card" issued by the Hospital Council 
of San Diego and Imperial counties. 
</P>
<P>
"We have earned a 'D' grade and are well on the way to failing to meet the 
access to medical care needs of San Diegans," according to a statement released 
Friday by Jim Lott, the council's president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
The council authorized the indigent-care study earlier this year because its 
members grew "increasingly alarmed" after 1988 losses linked to charity cases 
and bad debt rose to $46 million. 
</P>
<P>
Although past health-care studies have evaluated the county's indigent-care 
problems, "from a fragmented perspective, we felt it was really essential to 
sit down and take a look at the whole system's problems," said Jan Gould, a UC 
San Diego Medical Center administrator who served as a member of the council's 
Indigent Care Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
The report suggests that hospitals could "find themselves in conflict with the 
communities they serve" as they struggle to balance a "growing burden of 
uncompensated care" with the need to remain financially viable. 
</P>
<P>
The council's report card presents a bleak picture: 
</P>
<P>
* More than 25% of San Diego's non-elderly, non-military population has no 
health insurance. Statewide, the uninsured percentage is closer to 20%, and 
nationwide, 17.6% of the population lacks health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Among the nation's top 20 major metropolitan areas, San Diego has the 
second-highest percentage of non-elderly population with no health insurance of 
any kind. Those San Diegans face an uncertain future because "people without 
health insurance have substantially less access to necessary medical care than 
those with health insurance," according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the uninsured population, 25% of San Diegans now rely upon 
government health-care programs that fail to reimburse hospitals fully for the 
cost of providing services. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego has not "experienced the devastating disruptions of major hospital 
closures and service reductions," but the combination of uninsured and 
under-insured patients could bring "several key hospitals to the brink of 
closing or (force) major service reductions," according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The report notes that only two local hospitals have closed in recent years, but 
that more closings will occur because "circumstances could quickly change." 
</P>
<P>
* The county's six emergency and trauma service departments are "struggling" to 
handle a growing wave of uninsured and under-insured patients, according to the 
report. The county "boasts one of the finest trauma systems in the country . . 
. (but) one needs only to look north to Los Angeles to see what San Diego can 
look forward to if fundamental changes in the financing of health care are not 
made." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' financially troubled system has forced some hospitals to close 
their trauma operations, while others have downgraded the level of services 
available. San Diego's six trauma centers generated a $9.2-million net loss on 
$66.6 million in revenue during 1988, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
* Federal and state programs are largely to blame for the "eroding 
indigent-care" system, but San Diego County "stands out as one of the least 
responsive (counties in California) to local health-care needs and problems," 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego "ranks 57th of 58 in per capita total revenue appropriated for 
health-care mandates by the state," according to the report. "Only Butte 
County, with a population of 164,000, has allocated less revenue per capita to 
fund state-mandated health programs." 
</P>
<P>
Although the report focuses heavily upon problems, it offers an "action plan" 
that includes a call for local hospital administrators to spend more time 
lobbying health-care regulators and legislators in Sacramento and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The council report also urges administrators to support efforts to enact a 
minimum health-insurance package sponsored by a "government-private sector 
partnership."

EX-INFORMANT SUES DEA, CUSTOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego businessman who acted as an undercover government informant has 
sued the federal agencies he served, claiming that they abandoned him when he 
was jailed and tortured in Mexico while posing as a member of an international 
drug ring. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Erickson, 43, filed the suit last week against the federal government 
and various agents with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. 
Customs Service, charging that they violated his civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson contends he lost his house and his businesses -- in all, more than 
$2.5 million in assets -- because he was kept in a Mexican prison for seven 
months, ignored by the American agents who he claims authorized his travel to 
Mexico. He says he wants to be reimbursed for his losses. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in federal court in San Diego, also will raise questions about 
whether the U.S. agencies were operating clandestinely -- and therefore 
illegally -- in Mexico, said Erickson and one of his attorneys, Paul G. 
Edmonson. 
</P>
<P>
"The government advertises that they want individual professionals to help them 
track down these drug dealers," Erickson said. "Lawyers, doctors, accountants, 
people with business experience. I had a professional business. I helped them, 
and I really came to some great harm because of it. And they don't back you up 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
David Shaw, the assistant special agent in charge for the Customs Service in 
San Diego, conceded in a phone interview that Erickson worked two years ago on 
a joint Customs-DEA investigation. But the services are not responsible for any 
harm Erickson suffered in Mexico because they did not officially send him 
there, Shaw contended. 
</P>
<P>
"When people work for us, we give them the same speech over and over again," 
Shaw said. "Almost anybody that's a manager can recite it by heart -- that if 
we instruct you to go, we make the proper arrangements and consult the proper 
officials, in Mexico and in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't instruct you to go, we tell them, 'We're telling you not to go. 
And, if you do go, you're on your own. You're at your own risk.' In this 
particular case, that's what we're contending." 
</P>
<P>
Erickson's suit names as defendants Shaw's boss, Kenneth Ingleby, special agent 
in charge of Customs in San Diego, as well as Charles Hill, special agent in 
charge of the DEA's San Diego office. Phone calls to Ingleby were referred to 
Shaw. Hill did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
Also named as defendants were the agents Erickson said he primarily worked 
with, Brian Simon of Customs and Douglas Hebert of DEA, as well as the United 
States government. Simon and Hebert declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson's stint as a government informant began in January, 1987, when he 
telephoned the DEA office in National City and said he had information about 
what he believed was a drug-smuggling operation, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Erickson owned several San Diego businesses, including five 
limousine services, an auto parts store and an airplane charter firm, the suit 
says. The link to the smugglers was a limousine service customer, it says. 
</P>
<P>
Between January and March, 1987, the suit says, Erickson learned that the 
smugglers intended to use an airplane to transport drugs into the United States 
from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Since Erickson had an aircraft charter business, the agents told him his 
knowledge of planes and related paper work could make him valuable to the 
smugglers and lead to "valuable information" for the two agencies, the suit 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson agreed to provide that information, the suit says. In return, it says, 
the agents promised to "supervise and protect" Erickson and to give him 
expenses as well as 10% of any property seized as a result of information he 
provided. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the suit says, because of Erickson's clean record, the plane -- a 
twin-engine, turbojet Rockwell Aerocommander -- was registered in his name, 
with the knowledge and secret help of the two agencies. 
</P>
<P>
During the next couple of months, Erickson said, he made three trips to Mexico, 
but mechanical difficulties with the plane and problems with pilots cut two 
trips short. The agents knew about and approved both of those trips, Erickson 
said, and even picked him up once after he called from Mexico to inform them 
one of the smuggling trips had been aborted. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson's last trip to Mexico began Sept. 11, 1987. As the apparent owner of 
the plane, he was to straighten out some paper work with Mexican authorities, 
who reportedly had impounded the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Customs agent Simon directed Erickson to work with DEA agent Hiber, who 
approved the trip, the suit claims. It is that alleged authorization that the 
two agencies dispute, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit goes on to say that neither the Mexican government nor Mexican police 
had been told about Erickson's undercover trip. Erickson did not know that, it 
says. 
</P>
<P>
After Erickson arrived in Mexico City, he and one of the drug dealers waited 
for several days at an expensive hotel, El Presidente, while Mexican 
bureaucrats dealt with the paper work, Erickson said. But, on Sept. 17, as 
Erickson and the dealer were checking out of the hotel, they were arrested by 
Mexican Federal Judicial Police. 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, eight others involved in the smuggling group were arrested in 
another city, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson was held for eight days at Federal Judicial Police headquarters in 
Mexico City, where he was interrogated, beaten and shocked with an instrument 
resembling an electric cattle prod, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he was transferred to a federal prison near Mexico City, the Southern 
Detention Facility, where other members of the smuggling group also were 
imprisoned. They had begun to hear rumors of his dual role and beat him, the 
suit says. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson said he repeatedly tried to call the DEA and Customs offices in San 
Diego. Once, according to the suit, he reached the DEA office, only to be told 
by an agent, "You're no James Bond. . . . I don't know where you get off 
calling us from Mexico and charging us long-distance phone bills." 
</P>
<P>
Erickson languished in prison for seven months, until April, 1988. Erickson 
said Thursday he was released only after Nancy Reagan, the former First Lady, 
wrote a letter to the U.S. embassy in Mexico, urging an investigation into his 
jailing. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan apparently was prompted by letters Erickson's family had written 
about him to the White House, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
Since his release, Erickson said, he has pressed both agencies for money, but 
to no avail. He also filed formal administrative claims for compensation but, 
on Sept. 19, those, too, were turned down. "I've had nothing but lip service," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The case has been assigned to Judge Rudi M. Brewster.

BRADLEY, IN TURNAROUND, AGREES TO OK PORTER PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: MAYOR AND COUNCILMAN HAL BERNSON REACH COMPROMISE ON DETAILS OF 
$2-BILLION PROJECT IN CHATSWORTH. BASIC SCOPE OF THE BUILDING PLAN REMAINS 
UNCHANGED. 
</P>

<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley announced Friday that he and City Councilman Hal Bernson have 
reached a compromise agreement on the Porter Ranch project in Chatsworth, 
removing a major obstacle to approval of the biggest single development project 
in Los Angeles history. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley had threatened twice in the last week to veto the $2-billion proposal. 
But after two days of negotiations between Bernson and mayoral aides, a Bradley 
spokesman said the mayor would sign legislation authorizing the project if it 
is passed by the City Council in the compromise form. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley on Dec. 8 listed 10 demands for affordable housing, recycling, public 
transit and other measures to reduce traffic generated by the project, proposed 
by Beverly Hills builder Nathan Shapell, a major contributor to Bradley's 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, when the proposal went before the City Council's Planning and Land 
Use Management Committee, Bernson accepted some, but not all, of the mayor's 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson, who represents the area, has supported the project largely because of 
a range of public works improvements the developer will finance. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley promptly announced the next day that Bernson's changes did not satisfy 
him. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday, the mayor released a statement saying Bernson "deserves credit 
for working out an agreement that meets the needs of the area. Porter Ranch is 
a much better plan as a result of our mutual efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the compromise, the fundamental dimensions of the project remain 
unchanged. The 1,300-acre project on hillsides north of the Simi Valley Freeway 
would include 2,195 single-family homes, 1,200 town homes, and a commercial 
complex of nearly 6 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley had demanded that 20% of the project's 3,395 housing units be reserved 
for people of low and moderate income. Friday's agreement calls for 600 such 
units, or 18% to be reserved. The previous plan already had reserved 200 units 
for senior citizens, but not low-income seniors, and 400 for employees of the 
project's commercial center. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley had said that the plan needed public transit within the project area. 
The agreement Friday requires that an internal transit system be set up with 
private funds. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley also had sought a 50% parking reduction in the office complex, which 
will have buildings up to 10 stories high. Friday's agreement calls for a 25% 
reduction, with a third of parking revenues earmarked for support of the 
internal transit system. Bernson had opposed any parking reductions. 
</P>
<P>
He also opposed the mandatory recycling demanded by Bradley. The compromise 
calls for a composting program and space in homes and offices to store trash 
for recycling, but no specific recycling program would be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley dropped his demand to spread neighborhood-serving retail stores into 
the residential area. Spokesman Bill Chandler said the mayor was satisfied that 
traffic would be reduced by the transit system, the parking restrictions and a 
requirement that at least two commercial buildings provide residential space. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson agreed to set aside a site for a junior high school as well as an 
elementary school site. But Los Angeles school officials, including board 
member Julie Korenstein, object to the district having to buy the land before 
the year 2000 and to the required reopening of one of two closed schools before 
the elementary site could be acquired. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides that the proposed regional shopping mall within the 
commercial center -- which Bradley questioned -- could not be occupied until 
July 1, 1994. Bradley's statement said he hopes the delay will lead to 
re-evaluation of the need for it after large malls are built in Simi Valley and 
Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Clarke, a spokesman for the developer, said the delay is "absolutely 
meaningless" because plans do not call for the mall's occupancy until the 
mid-1990s. Clarke called the revisions "just a further fine-tuning." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said: "I can live with everything in there. . . . We're happy to add 
anything that will make this a better plan, although we believe most of the 
things the mayor had addressed were already covered in the plan." 
</P>
<P>
Some City Hall officials questioned whether the mayor and Bernson were debating 
insignificant details. 
</P>
<P>
"I would guess the mayor is doing everything he can to get involved in issues 
that divert attention from his main problem, and a controversy like this with 
Bernson is probably the best news he's had in six months because it takes Far 
East National Bank off the pages," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley has been embroiled since March in a controversy about his personal 
finances, including consulting fees he obtained from the Far East National 
Bank, which in 1988 and 1989 received $3 million in city deposits. 
</P>
<P>
One high-ranking city official, who asked not to be named, said Bradley's 
Porter Ranch position "was the mayor showing that he still lives and breathes, 
and probably the mayor's new staff saying, 'Let's do things on a more 
pro-active basis.' " 
</P>
<P>
"It's unusual," Councilman John Ferraro said of the mayor's involvement in a 
development issue before its consideration by the full council. "I don't know 
of any time in the past that he's taken this kind of position." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Fabiani, who took over last month as the mayor's chief of staff, said 
Bradley's concerns were substantial and well founded because of the magnitude 
of the project. "This is an important project, it's an important precedent, and 
the mayor feels strongly about it," Fabiani said. 
</P>
<P>
Don Worsham, a spokesman for a Porter Ranch residents' group opposed to the 
size of the proposed commercial area, had a mixed reaction to the agreement's 
provisions. "Obviously they go a long way in meeting the important objectives 
the mayor had," he said. "We are still concerned with the commercial density."

SCHOOLS GET BEST MARKS FROM PARENTS OF STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: POLL FINDS THAT THE PERCEPTIONS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COUNTY'S 
SCHOOLS IS LINKED TO WHETHER RESPONDENT HAS DIRECT CONTACTS WITH SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County residents who have children in public schools view education 
much more favorably than those without direct links to the schools, according 
to a new poll sampling attitudes toward area schools. 
</P>
<P>
Among residents with at least one child in county schools, 75% give schools 
either an "A" or "B" in performance, contrasted with only 36% when the views of 
all residents are compiled. Only 28% of county residents have children in 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
The general public also believes that drugs are the biggest problem facing the 
school system, but parents with schoolchildren believe, by more than 
two-to-one, that crowded classrooms are a much more pressing issue. 
</P>
<P>
The report finds some significant variations between the responses of those who 
have school-age children and those who do not. It says that "overall, using any 
indicator of familiarity with the schools, the data show very clearly those who 
know the schools best rate them more favorably than those who do not know the 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
It also finds an "age gap" in the evaluations, "with older citizens and those 
who have already had children pass through the school system having a more 
nostalgic and conservative view of the schools, and wanting schools to return 
to the way they used to be in the distant past." 
</P>
<P>
The telephone survey asking 80 questions of 1,601 adults was carried out in 
late September and early October for the San Diego County office of Education 
by Decision Research Co. The survey used a method to ensure equal probability 
of reaching residents regardless of whether their telephone numbers were listed 
and was conducted in households with telephones in which English or Spanish is 
spoken. The findings are valid within 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
The results parallel those found in an annual nationwide Gallup Poll survey 
that asks similar questions. They also differ little from an initial survey 
done last year that was used by the county office as the basis to begin an 
information campaign to boost positive public perception of public education. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the newest data, "it is premature to look for change in public 
attitudes toward the schools," the report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
Among the major overall findings: 
</P>
<P>
* Twenty-four percent said that schools are better today contrasted with five 
years ago, 23% said schools are worse, 29% said they are about the same, and 
24% said they don't know. 
</P>
<P>
* By geographic area, people in inland areas of North County consistently rate 
schools more highly than do residents of the San Diego city area. By ethnicity, 
Latinos are most favorable toward schools, with 46% giving schools an "A" or 
"B," contrasted with 34% of whites and 30% of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
* Almost 80% support sex education in elementary and junior-high schools, 56% 
back year-round schools, 79% call for a national testing program, 83% back 
national achievement goals and 68% back reforms to give teachers at individual 
schools more power over how to run their campuses. 
</P>
<P>
* Eighty-two percent favor financial awards for high-achieving schools, 55% 
favor choice -- where parents could choose any school within a district for 
their children -- and 76% say that parents should be responsible for any 
transportation required under choice. 
</P>
<P>
* Sixty-six percent want students to spend more time in school, with 68% of 
Latinos and 77% of blacks supporting more school instruction. 
</P>
<P>
* Only 4% think teachers are overpaid; 45% think they are underpaid and 45% 
think their pay is about right. 
</P>
<P>
* Almost 23% of the general public said they "don't know" enough about public 
schools to make any judgments, contrasted with 12% of those with children in 
schools. Of those who said they don't have enough information, 76% said they 
lack basic information from the media. 
</P>
<P>
And, despite 76% of all residents saying they would vote for school bonds, the 
report pointed out that in only one recent county school bond election, the 
$27-million issue in Escondido in June, did school officials receive the 
necessary 66 2/3% "yes" vote. "Support is higher among Democrats, liberals and 
less likely voters than among Republicans, conservatives and more likely 
voters," the report said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEW IN BRIEF: YOUTH, 15, SENT TO PRISON IN KILLING OF 
CLASSMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A computer analyst's 15-year-old son, who shot to death a Glassell Park junior 
high school classmate for wearing a jersey carrying the name of a rival gang, 
was sentenced in an Eastlake Juvenile courtroom Friday to 17 years to life 
imprisonment. Because the youth is a minor, he will be set free at the age of 
25 if he is not paroled before then, attorneys in the case said. The youth 
confessed to shooting Mark Iwashita, 14, at point-blank range on Aug. 8, the 
day after Iwashita wore an "Atwater-13" jersey to Washington Irving Junior High 
School. While the convicted youth's father, who works for IBM, and his mother 
and brother stood by, Judge Jaime Corral told the teen-ager that he was 
"fortunate that your parents are more stable than most families that come to 
this court. Because of your age and the support of your family, there is hope 
for you."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 LONGTIME ACTIVISTS TO LEAD KWANZAA PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two veteran black community activists were named Thursday to lead a parade that 
will be the centerpiece of an African-American cultural festival in South Los 
Angeles. Celes King II and Arlillian Moody will be king and queen of the 13th 
annual Kwanzaa Parade on Dec. 30, event organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
King, 67, is a bail bondsman who secured the release of more than 5,000 people 
arrested and jailed in the South for civil rights work in the 1960s, said 
parade planners. He now is a California leader of the Congress for Racial 
Equality. 
</P>
<P>
Moody, 75, is owner of a West Adams-area social center and has assisted 
hundreds of homeless and other disadvantaged people in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The parade will begin at 11 a.m. and run along Crenshaw Boulevard between Adams 
Boulevard and Leimert Park, said Yuseff Majahliwa, one of the organizers.

As many as 23 diners received minor injuries from flying glass when a blast 
from an executive jet making a turn blew out a plate glass window at the 
Copacabana restaurant at Lindbergh Field late Friday night, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Gulfstream (aircraft) was just making a turn to get on the runway when its 
blast hit," said a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Fire Department paramedics said eight persons were sent to three area 
hospitals and another "10 to 15" were treated at the scene. Most of the 
injuries involved cuts or twisted ankles.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MEDFLY FOUND IN COMPTON; AERIAL SPRAYING 
ORDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pregnant Mediterranean fruit fly was found Friday in Compton, prompting 
officials to order multiple aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion over 
that community. 
</P>
<P>
The fly was found about three miles west of a Medfly discovery in South Gate, 
broadening the boundaries of the escalating infestation. Officials said exact 
spray dates and new spray zone locations will be announced within a week. 
Compton residents will receive notice of the first spray affecting their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next five months, more than 250 miles of largely residential 
neighborhoods will be sprayed at least 12 times with malathion in an aggressive 
attempt to eradicate the crop-destroying pest.

RESIDENTS WEST OF SANTA CLARITA SEEK CITYHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A citizens group took a small step toward creating a new city west of Santa 
Clarita on Friday when it turned in petitions asking a state agency to study 
the feasibility of incorporating the proposed city of Sunset Hills. 
</P>
<P>
An earlier petition drive fell 24 signatures short of the 142 needed to request 
formation of a city of 27.8 square miles in an area west of the Golden State 
Freeway and south of Magic Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood proponents needed signatures from 25% of the area's 567 registered 
voters to qualify their petition, said Michi Takahashi, a spokeswoman for the 
Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO), which oversees annexations and 
incorporations. 
</P>
<P>
Friday was the deadline to submit additional signatures, and cityhood 
proponents submitted more than 50 new signatures. 
</P>
<P>
If the signatures are certified by the Los Angeles County registrar of voters, 
LAFCO would begin the lengthy task of studying whether a financial base exists 
to support the proposed city, Takahashi said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita Mayor Jo Anne Darcy, who succeeded Jan Heidt as mayor Tuesday 
night, said Friday that Santa Clarita probably will oppose the incorporation of 
Sunset Hills because the City Council "would like to see it come into our 
city," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Clarita City Council asked LAFCO to declare the Sunset Hills area 
eligible for annexation, but LAFCO denied the request last month. 
</P>
<P>
Some Santa Clarita residents called the Sunset Hills cityhood effort a sham, 
saying it was just an attempt by the area's principal developer, the Dale Poe 
Development Corp., to avoid Santa Clarita's development restrictions. Santa 
Clarita City Councilman Dennis Koontz has sarcastically labeled the proposed 
city "Poe-Town." 
</P>
<P>
But Ernest Dynda, one of the cityhood proponents, on Friday said the 
incorporation effort is genuine. 
</P>
<P>
Dynda, a former Agoura Hills city councilman who helped that city incorporate 
in 1982, said Sunset Hills offers cityhood proponents a unique opportunity 
because the area is largely undeveloped. Rather than wait to incorporate an 
area already filled with traffic and planning problems, the cityhood supporters 
could attack problems before they begin, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The other leaders of the incorporation drive are Jeff Reed, a Sunset Pointe 
resident, and Jeff Stevenson, a vice president of Dale Poe Development.

ACCORD NEAR IN U.S. SUIT OVER REDISTRICTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal lawsuit seeking to force Los Angeles County supervisors to redraw 
their districts appears close to settlement with a plan that places veteran 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum in a new, predominantly Latino district. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Justice Department said in a letter to the county Friday that the plan 
adopted earlier this week by the supervisors could settle the lawsuit with a 
few revisions. 
</P>
<P>
"A settlement is at hand if the board is willing to make these adjustments," 
said the letter. The Justice Department called for adding neighborhoods in 
Montebello and Pico Rivera with high Latino voter turnouts to the proposed 1st 
District to improve the chances of a Latino to win election to the county 
board. 
</P>
<P>
A settlement could come as early as Tuesday when attorneys for both sides are 
scheduled to meet again in U.S. District Court. The county plan would place 
Schabarum in a mostly Latino district extending east of downtown Los Angeles 
through much of the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Deane Dana, who cast the deciding vote in favor of the plan, could 
not be reached for comment on whether he would accept the proposed revisions, 
which would appear to preserve his political base. Supervisor Kenneth Hahn's 
chief deputy, Mas Fukai, said Friday that he expects a majority of the board to 
reach agreement on a plan with the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter to the county, Steven H. Rosenbaum, deputy chief of the Justice 
Department's voting rights section, said: "Our preliminary review of the 
redistricting plan leads us to conclude that although it is flawed in some 
respects, it could provide the framework for the development of a plan that 
would resolve this litigation. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan's most significant positive feature is that it reduces . . . 
fragmentation of the Hispanic population core, from the eastern part of the 
city of Los Angeles to the San Gabriel Valley, by placing much of that 
population in District 1." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Justice Department objected that the county plan leaves out of the 
new district portions of heavily Latino Lincoln Heights and Highland Park while 
including communities with small Latino populations, such as Covina, Diamond 
Bar, Temple City and Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
Any settlement would have to include an agreement on an effective date for a 
new plan, said Rosenbaum, who wrote that the Justice Department is "troubled" 
by the county's effort to delay an election in the new district until 1992. 
Currently, the 1st District seat is up in June. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors Tuesday are scheduled to vote behind closed doors on whether to 
accept the revisions to their plan. Schabarum has called on his GOP allies to 
apply pressure on fellow Republican Dana to withdraw his support for the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Trial on the lawsuit has been delayed until Jan. 2 to allow for settlement 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
None of the plaintiffs, including the American Civil Liberties Union and 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, would comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit accuses supervisors of breaking up the Latino neighborhoods among 
three districts.

JUDGE DENIES WOMAN CUSTODY OF LESBIAN EX-LOVER'S CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge denied parental status Friday to a lesbian seeking custody of her 
former lover's young daughter but also said she believes that the issue of 
parental rights in such cases needs to be reviewed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that the case crossed uncharted legal waters, Los Angeles Superior Court 
Judge Dana Henry ruled that Terri Sabol, 33, had not presented evidence to show 
"that there was contact of such a nature or duration between (Sabol) and the 
child" to allow her to have parental rights to the girl. 
</P>
<P>
Henry added, however, "It is absolutely imperative that the Legislature 
re-examine its laws" in this area. 
</P>
<P>
The child, who was referred to only as "Baby B," was conceived by Sabol's lover 
after insemination using sperm from Sabol's brother. 
</P>
<P>
One of Sabol's legal arguments was that "parental estoppel," the bond between a 
child and the person who acts as a parent but is neither the biological nor 
adoptive parent, had been established. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the child's mother, identified only as Susan, had 
broken her promise that Sabol would have joint custody of the child after the 
couple broke up in July, 1988, the judge based her decision on the finding that 
the child, who turns 3 today, never "relied on" Sabol as a parent. 
</P>
<P>
Citing cases of people who served as parents for six to 11 years, the judge 
said the common thread in precedents was a long-duration relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Sabol, 33, the owner of a Long Beach hair salon, appeared stunned by the 
judge's decision and broke into tears after Henry left the bench. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked, really shocked," said Sabol, the only party in the case who was 
publicly identified. 
</P>
<P>
Sabol's attorney, Gloria Allred, had unsuccessfully argued that her client was 
entitled to parental rights on the grounds that she acted as a parent and 
bonded with the child, despite the fact that Sabol is not the biological or 
adoptive parent. 
</P>
<P>
Allred said she will appeal the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"We are definitely filing a notice of appeal," Allred said. "We believe that 
persons who are gay and lesbian have the right to be parents. Ms. Sabol became 
a parent in the only way that she could." 
</P>
<P>
The mother's lawyer, Glen Schwartz, said the ruling was consistent with state 
law. Testimony showed that Susan was the mother and Steve Sabol was the 
biological father, and there is no authority to establish a third-parent 
privilege, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sabol and her "life partner" decided in March, 1985, that they wanted a child. 
Part of the decision was that Susan would carry the baby because Sabol "was in 
a better position to be the breadwinner," Allred said. 
</P>
<P>
Allred said Sabol supported her partner through her pregnancy and served as a 
parent until the women broke up in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Sabol claimed that by October, 1988, she was refused visitation rights and not 
allowed to share in making decisions involving the girl, as the women had 
agreed when they chose to raise a child. 
</P>
<P>
Sabol filed her potentially precedent-setting lawsuit after being denied 
visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
"We are one of the first to have been permitted to have access to the courts to 
have the custody issue resolved," Allred said. 
</P>
<P>
The mother sought dismissal of the suit, but those motions were denied and the 
case went forward. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to an appeal, Sabol could be allowed to see the child if her 
brother files a paternity suit and wins parental rights, Allred said.

FAN GETS 3 YEARS ON PROBATION FOR THREATENING STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Westlake Village shipping clerk who in a year's time sent nearly 6,000 
threatening letters to actor Michael J. Fox was sentenced to three years 
probation Friday after she pleaded guilty to three counts of making terrorist 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
Tina Marie Ledbetter, 27, was ordered to receive psychiatric therapy and to 
stay away from Fox, his wife, actress Tracy Pollan, and the couple's young 
child. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan J. Gruber said Ledbetter could face a maximum jail 
term of four years and four months if she violates the terms of the plea 
bargain, which was entered in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Gruber said she believed the nine months of jail time that Ledbetter has 
already served "got her attention" and may deter her from repeating her threats 
to kill Fox or his family members. 
</P>
<P>
Ledbetter told investigators that she hated Pollan and was furious when Fox 
married her. 
</P>
<P>
The expletive-filled letters, written in capital letters and punctuated with 
strings of exclamation points, began arriving in February, 1988, at a rate 
averaging 15 per day. When she was arrested a year later, after two boxes of 
rabbit feces sent to Fox were traced to her home, investigators found numerous 
threatening letters ready to be sent. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, Fox testified that he took the threats seriously and that 
they "changed my life style extensively." Fox hired a security agency, arranged 
for extra security on the set and said Pollan traveled under a false name 
before Ledbetter's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"She has a lot to lose if she violates her probation," Gruber said of 
Ledbetter. "The time in custody has served as a potential rehabilitation, as 
far as her understanding of the nature and consequences of her crime." 
</P>
<P>
Ledbetter, who had never lived apart from her mother before being taken into 
custody last February and held without bail in the psychiatric unit of the 
Sybil Brand Institute for Women, was to be released either Friday or today, as 
soon as the necessary documents could be processed. 
</P>
<P>
She was among the first individuals to be prosecuted under a law that makes 
verbal threats a crime, regardless of the person's intent to carry them out. 
The law was designed originally to be a tool to stop gang intimidation of 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Gruber acknowledged concern that Ledbetter might once again pose a threat to 
Fox. But, she said, "it is hard to predict future dangerousness and Miss 
Ledbetter has not been a physical aggressor." 
</P>
<P>
According to Gruber, Fox agreed that Ledbetter's sentence was appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we have a handle on her now, and we will closely supervise and monitor 
her to make sure she is no longer a threat to them or to herself," Gruber said.

D.A. WON'T PROSECUTE IN SHOOTING DEATHS OVER MINING DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego County district attorney has decided not to prosecute an El Cajon 
man who "honestly and reasonably" believed his life was in danger and thus 
acted in self-defense when he shot and killed two Julian residents in a mining 
dispute last May. 
</P>
<P>
Barring the introduction of any new evidence, Dist. Atty. Edwin L. Miller Jr. 
said Friday that he considers the case closed. 
</P>
<P>
The Memorial Day shooting occurred at the Ready Relief mine on federal land in 
the Julian area, not far from the Horseshoe Curve area of California 78. Gustav 
Hudson, 41, his son and a friend reported hearing a gunshot before they 
returned fire, killing Christopher Zerbe, 34, and Edward John Lopes, 66. 
</P>
<P>
Miller mailed a letter to Sheriff John Duffy on Thursday, informing him of his 
decision. Miller said that Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan Williams had "studied 
(deputies') reports, visited the scene, spoken with detectives and interviewed 
Hudson" before making his decision. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. John Tenwolde of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department said Friday that 
he was "not at all surprised" by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The D.A. reached the conclusion we thought he would," Tenwolde said. "We're 
totally in agreement with the findings of the D.A. in this case." 
</P>
<P>
Tenwolde said his office submitted a 600-page report on the shooting to county 
prosecutors in September, without recommending a course of action. 
</P>
<P>
According to the letter Miller mailed to Duffy, the facts of the case were 
these: 
</P>
<P>
Hudson and nine other people turned off California 78 and through a gate 
leading across private property to the Ready Reserve mine, which is on federal 
land. On May 19, Hudson had recorded a gold-mining claim for the property and 
on May 29 -- the day of the shooting -- was attempting to mark the claim and 
picnic at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Hours before the shooting, Hudson's son drove his pickup truck down a narrow 
dirt road, en route to the claim site, when he encountered Zerbe and Lopes. A 
confrontation ensued after Zerbe ordered Gustav Hudson to stay off any property 
mined by others; in other words, to limit himself to the area of his own claim. 
Hudson agreed. 
</P>
<P>
The groups parted, and several hours passed from "shortly before midday" to 
"around 5 or 5:30," when Zerbe and Lopes showed up and fired a shot at Gustav 
Hudson and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson grabbed his AK-47 semiautomatic assault rifle; a second shot was fired 
by Zerbe and Lopes, and then all three men opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
Zerbe's truck door opened and then Zerbe fell out, gravely wounded. Lopes 
remained in the truck, fatally shot through the head and chest. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's letter notes that Zerbe, according to detectives, had a reputation as 
"a dangerous man with a weapon." An autopsy revealed that Zerbe had a 
blood-alcohol level of .11 % and Lopes of .10 %. 
</P>
<P>
Miller concluded in his report that physical evidence backed up the statements 
of Hudson's family and friends. Miller wrote that homicide is justified when a 
person is under the "honest and reasonable belief" that a "forcible and 
atrocious crime" is about to be committed against them. 
</P>
<P>
"The key then becomes whether (Hudson) 'honestly and reasonably' believed that 
he was in imminent danger of being slain," Miller wrote. "There can be little 
doubt on this point."

'SMOKING GUN' PAPER 3 MONTHS OLD; 
</P>
<P>
CONFLICT: WHY DID A SAN DIEGO COUNCILMAN WAIT SINCE SEPTEMBER TO RELEASE A 
CONTRACT HE CLAIMS SHOWS THAT AN ENVIRONMENTALIST WAS SECRETLY SOLICITING 
BUSINESS FROM A DEVELOPER? THE CONTROVERSY SWIRLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego City Councilman Bruce Henderson kept silent for three months about a 
controversial document he claims is the "smoking gun" that proves that a 
leading city environmentalist was secretly soliciting payments from a 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson has had the draft contract he released Thursday in his possession 
since September, when Michael Gelfand, senior vice president for the De Anza 
Group Inc., gave him the confidential three-page document, Gelfand said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson on Thursday released the proposed contract between Bob Glaser, 
co-chairman of San Diegans for Managed Growth, and De Anza, claiming that 
Glaser was soliciting payments from the developer to help De Anza win city 
approval for a 1,400-room resort hotel on the shores of Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson claims that the contract shows that Glaser was motivated by greed 
when he joined a group of environmentalists who lobbied to have Henderson 
removed as chairman of the council's Public Facilities and Recreation 
Committee, a post he said he was using to oppose De Anza's development. The 
council replaced Henderson Dec. 4 with Councilman Bob Filner, a favorite of the 
environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
Asked Friday why Henderson waited until Thursday to hold his press conference, 
Henderson's spokesman said "it was not until the first week of December that it 
became apparent that Glaser was able to fool a substantial number of people" 
about his motives for seeking Henderson's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
Glaser, who has vehemently denied Henderson's charges, says that he purposely 
worded the contract vaguely so that Gelfand would have to pay him for his idea. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy is a complete liar," he said of Henderson. "He has prefabricated a 
story that he knows to be false. He got the document months ago. He held it, 
now he's sitting there trying to fabricate this story." 
</P>
<P>
Glaser claims that Henderson, fearing the results of the city's new district 
elections system that resulted in victories for three environmentalists this 
fall, is attempting to smear Glaser, a potential opponent in the 1991 
elections. Glaser lost the 1987 6th District primary to Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that now the heat should be turned up on Mr. Henderson, on his 
decision-making process, on why he sits on this information if he thought it 
was so outrageous," Glaser said. 
</P>
<P>
Glaser claims that he wrote up the three-page contract on behalf of his 
consulting firm, The La Jolla Group, to solicit Gelfand's interest in an 
alternate proposal that would move the resort east of I-5 and return the 
company's 70 acres on De Anza Point to parkland. 
</P>
<P>
Glaser sought $250,000 from De Anza if the City Council approved Glaser's 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Gelfand said Friday that he gave the contract to Henderson when he asked the 
councilman for advice about whether to continue negotiations with Glaser and 
considered the document confidential. Gelfand said that Henderson advised 
against working with Glaser, adding that he rejected Glaser's offer largely 
because Glaser was asking too much money. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never hired him. He's never worked for us. There's never been any 
exchange of funds or anything," Gelfand said. 
</P>
<P>
Gelfand said could not verify Henderson or Glaser's story because Glaser never 
told him anything about the alternate hotel project.

A MIGHTY FORTRESS INDEED; 
</P>
<P>
EAST GERMANY: AS PARIAHS IN A COMMUNIST SOCIETY, CHURCHES DEVELOPED AN 
INDEPENDENT NICHE -- AND NURTURED A CIVIL REFORMATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CATTAU, Daniel Cattau, former director of the Lutheran Council News 
Bureau in New York, was recently in East Germany. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Castle Church in Lutherstadt Wittenberg, where Martin Luther posted his 95 
Theses in 1517, was refurbished in 1983, the 500th anniversary of the 
reformer's birth. Near the top of the tall, white church tower is now a gold 
band inscribed, Ein Feste Berg ist Unsere Gott -- the first words to the battle 
hymn of the Reformation, "A Mighty Fortress is Our God." 
</P>
<P>
When the local leaders of the Socialist Unity (Communist) Party saw this 
impressive statement of faith, they asked church leaders what words from Luther 
might be appropriate for their building. The church leaders suggested the 
beginning of the hymn's second stanza: "No strength of ours can match His 
might." 
</P>
<P>
This story accurately depicts the role of the East German Protestant churches 
in socialism: quiet opposition with a clear distinction between what belongs to 
the church and what to the state. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the church's role in toppling the monolithic Communist rule 
has been ignored in the litany of other factors: Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of 
glasnost, Hungary's decision to open its border, the great numbers of East 
Germans fleeing to the West, the opening of the Berlin Wall and the country's 
woeful economic, educational and ecological situation. 
</P>
<P>
But in talks I've had with dozens of East Germans, it was clear that the church 
played -- and continues to play -- a critical role in the reformation of 
society. In an interview at the Luther House in Wittenberg, Friedrich 
Schorlemmer, a theologian and leading spokesman for the Democratic Awakening, 
drew a parallel between the Reformation and the current upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
"Luther said the church is only the church when it always reforms itself, and 
lets itself be reformed," said Schorlemmer, who has already been transformed 
from an enemy of the state into a media star. "Socialism is only socialism if 
it's capable of being renewed." 
</P>
<P>
After World War II and the division of Germany, church membership in heavily 
Protestant East Germany declined from more than 80% of the population to about 
30% today. The government thought it had dealt a fatal blow by enforcing strict 
church-state separation, eliminating state funding and teaching only Marxism 
and Leninism in schools. Added to that was a heavy dose of oppression. 
</P>
<P>
The severing of church-state ties, however, was a blessing for the three 
territorial Lutheran and five united Lutheran and Reformed churches that 
comprise a loose, 5-million-member Federation of Evangelical Churches. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Berlin Wall was erected in 1961, the East German churches had close 
ties with the wealthier, state-supported churches in the Federal Republic. In 
1968, these formal ties were severed and the East German churches, after a long 
period of confrontation, moved toward being a church in socialism -- but, as 
its leaders point out, not a church of socialism. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, the church had found a niche in society by the late 1970s that was 
to grow into a full-scale spiritual and political movement a decade later: It 
was a "free room," as the Germans say, where church and non-church people could 
discuss issues rarely brought up outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
It began with peace groups discussing East-West tensions and the redeployment 
of missiles in the two Germanys, and grew to discussions of human rights and 
social justice, the environment, military service, freedom of travel, press 
freedom and free elections. The church also played a key role in uncovering 
vote-rigging in last May's local elections, encouraging people to stay in East 
Germany and spawning many of the leaders of the opposition parties and groups. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982 the Nicholas Church and later the Thomas Church in Leipzig began what 
looked, at first, to be innocuous Monday-night prayer services; it was after 
these services that 200,000 took to the street in October. These prayer 
services and demonstrations were soon replicated throughout the land of Luther, 
Bach, Schiller and Goethe. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no other free room in society," for opposition groups, said Gerhard 
Thomas, editor of The Church, a newspaper of the Berlin-Brandenburg Evangelical 
Church. "The revolution was so peaceful from the side of the demonstrators -- 
that was the spirit of the church. The spirit of the revolution was the spirit 
of the church." 
</P>
<P>
In Wittenberg, a small university town in Luther's day but now a 
quasi-industrial city of 50,000 people, townspeople complained in the local 
paper that the demonstrators had left a mess in the Market Place in front of 
Luther's statue: Wax from prayer vigil candles covered the stones on the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
Albrecht Steinwachs, a local pastor, gave perhaps the best testimony to the 
role of the church when he wrote in response, "I would rather see 1,000 drops 
of candle wax on the Market Place than one drop of blood."

SHOULD DE KLERK GET A STATE VISIT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like his predecessor, Pieter W. Botha, South Africa President Frederik W. de 
Klerk is intent on repairing relations with other nations. Thus, much is being 
made in Pretoria of the royal reception De Klerk was accorded on his visit to 
the Ivory Coast, his first visit out of the country since his election. But 
there is nothing to judge the significance of the trip beyond its cordial 
atmospherics. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his predecessor, De Klerk has articulated a commitment to broad 
political change. This has inspired suggestions that Washington follow the 
example of the Ivory Coast with an invitation for a state visit by De Klerk and 
a relaxation of sanctions. This would be a mistake, as the Bush Administration 
seems to understand. Washington, wisely, has adopted a wait-and-see attitude 
while giving the new South African leader the benefit of the doubt until proven 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Caution is dictated by two considerations. First, the reforms that De Klerk has 
undertaken, however remarkable they may seem against the background of 
repressive racism in South Africa, are largely cosmetic and do not yet address 
the fundamentals of racism and segregation that drive apartheid. And, second, 
what few reforms there are appear to be coming in response to pressure, not 
least the pressure of American sanctions (even though they have not been 
faithfully applied). 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the Bush Administration is "a nonracial and democratic South 
Africa," Herman J. Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, 
told Congress recently. De Klerk has rejected both concepts, affirming instead 
government by groups, meaning races, while rejecting universal suffrage in the 
sense commonly understood in practicing democracies -- that is, one person, one 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen spelled out some of the conditions required if there's to be any chance 
to achieve the dialogue De Klerk has promised the people of South Africa. Among 
those conditions are an end to the 4-year-old national state of 
emergency,release of Nelson Mandela and the other political prisoners, return 
of the political exiles and legalization of the African National Congress and 
other opposition groups that are now banned. 
</P>
<P>
The new assistant secretary recognized the importance of "balancing pressure 
and incentives" and, in so doing, specifically committed the Administration "to 
effective enforcement of our existing sanctions." This commitment is now being 
tested following exposure in The Times of flagrant abuses in steel imports from 
South Africa by Americans ready to look for loopholes rather than adhere to the 
intent of the law. This matter is now under review by the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
As we understand Administration thinking, it will be watching the next session 
of the South African Parliament with special interest. The Parliament convenes 
in February and ends in July. On its agenda will be De Klerk's call for 
abolition of the Separate Amenities Act. Though promising, that would be but a 
modest beginning of what needs to happen if there is to be true dialogue. His 
cutbacks in military service and the military budget also are promising. So was 
his surprise visit with Mandela -- and his commitment Friday to cooperate with 
Mozambique. But only when there has been fulfillment of the fundamentals for 
dialogue can Washington usefully consider an invitation to De Klerk to come to 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, communication is important, and Felix Houphouet-Boigny, president of the 
Ivory Coast, whose collaboration with South Africa is long-standing, may have 
helped it along. Other South African presidents have been welcomed to Abidjan, 
but none with the ceremony accorded De Klerk. The meaning of the visit, 
however, will be measured not just in expanding contacts between Pretoria and 
other African nations, but what it means for the disenfranchised black majority 
in South Africa.

GIFT SUGGESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Red Cross Blood Services officials are sounding a call for volunteers willing 
to make holiday donations of blood so that an adequate supply can be assured 
through the always-critical period from Christmas to early January. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco earthquake brought an extraordinary response in Los Angeles 
and Orange counties, with donations about 7,000 units above normal. As a 
result, the local Red Cross has a 10-day supply on hand just before Christmas. 
This contrasts with the crisis last year when there was only a one-day supply 
and some surgeries had to be canceled. It is to avoid a repetition of that 
problem, and to overcome the usual slackening of donations over the holidays, 
that the appeal has been sounded for donations Dec. 26 through Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers may arrange appointments at a donor center or bloodmobile near their 
home by calling (213) 739-5290 for Los Angeles County or (714) 835-5381 for 
Orange County.

WE'RE WATCHING THE DEATH OF HOPE;

<P>
REFUGEES: THE VIETNAMESE SHIPPED BACK TO HANOI BY HONG KONG ONLY WANTED THE 
FREEDOM THEY COULD SEE DAILY OUTSIDE THEIR BARBED WIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LAM, Andrew Lam is an editor for Pacific News Service. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each broken-hearted Vietnamese refugee being rushed Tuesday onto a plane 
heading from Hong Kong to Hanoi was given $30 -- a consolation prize, 
compliments of the authorities in the British colony. 
</P>
<P>
But the refugees, who went unwillingly back to Vietnam, had already tasted 
freedom. They saw it through the barbed-wire fences as Chinese children laughed 
on their way to school. They watched it gleam on the tall, glassy skyscrapers 
that towered over their own tin-roofed huts. They heard it spoken on their 
radios; freedom danced on the Chinese-language television screen. Freedom 
taunted them, but proved forever elusive. 
</P>
<P>
Pinned on my wall are photos of refugee children staring out from behind the 
bars of their camps with wide, hungry eyes. They remind me of myself, 15 years 
ago a Vietnamese refugee in the Philippines and later in Guam. I remember days 
spent staring out through those fences toward real homes in the distance, 
wishing that my family and I could be there instead of inside muggy army tents. 
The children in the pictures are waiting for the same things that I did. They 
want to live where I do now. 
</P>
<P>
If the British resume forced repatriation early next year, as planned, they can 
expect riots, fire, bloodshed, suicides in the camps. For when the grand prize 
of freedom is taken away, no consolation prize can compensate. The crowded bunk 
beds, the piled-up feces, the stench and murderous heat, the cholera outbreaks, 
the years of waiting, all these horrid conditions and indignities, once 
endurable, suddenly become maddening. Endurance may be a characteristically 
Vietnamese trait, but my countrymen endure only when hopes and dreams are 
nurtured in their hearts. Take away those dreams and chances are they will 
commit desperate, violent acts. 
</P>
<P>
Displayed in the refugee camps are signs that read: "We would rather die than 
go back," and "Better dead than Red." They are written with blood. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting has become fruitless. Hope for freedom is but a one-way ticket "home" 
-- home to face the assured cruelty and revenge from Vietnamese authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Condemned is he who is branded an "economic refugee," for he has no chance of 
resettlement in a third country. Only "political refugees" are considered 
legitimate refugees, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has declared in faraway 
London. Only a minuscule number of the boat people have successfully defined 
themselves for Hong Kong authorities as political refugees. The rest are to be 
sent home. But were you to look at those who stare out from the fences with an 
unbanishable hunger for freedom, you could never know the difference between a 
Vietnamese political refugee and an economic one. And how could anyone make 
such a distinction among thousands of children living in those camps? 
</P>
<P>
The labels don't fit. The differences are apparent only to those who make up 
rules and regulations that brush the majority off as "illegal immigrants." But 
all of the refugees fleeing communist Vietnam will be punished when they 
return, no matter if they are from the north or the south, ethnic Chinese or 
not, political or economic refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the refugees would argue that the fact that they took flight itself is 
the most political act imaginable. By leaving, they defied an oppressive 
communist system known for its human rights violations. The refugees would tell 
you that they did not escape for better bread or rice. They had heard that tens 
of thousands of Vietnamese perished on the South China Sea; they understood the 
odds. They wanted more than bread; they wanted a life without persecution, a 
life where no authority has the power to move them and their families about. 
</P>
<P>
"We want freedom," writes a young Vietnamese man asking for help. "They jailed 
my father and forced my siblings and me to work in the isolated mountainous 
areas." He is the son of a sergeant who once served as a medic in the South 
Vietnamese army in Danang. "If you could save me," he writes, "I will devote my 
entire life to the cause of freedom." 
</P>
<P>
But like the 46,000 people due to be sent back to Hanoi next year, this young 
man will likely spend his future in those mountainous areas from which he so 
desperately tried to escape. He will spend his life longing for freedom, not 
serving it. 
</P>
<P>
I remember my bus ride to the Guam airport en route to the United States years 
ago. I was elated; I couldn't sit still. The cool, sweet wind rushed through 
the windows and I thought I felt freedom whispering on my skin then. I wish I 
could share that experience with this young man and those like him. Instead I 
mourn for my countrymen's fate. I can't begin to imagine the bitterness they 
feel as they take their dark journey toward an ominous Vietnam.

MAN, 30, IS INJURED AFTER CAR COLLIDES WITH TROLLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 30-year-old San Diego man was injured Friday night when a southbound San 
Diego Trolley collided with his eastbound car at 12th Avenue and E Street. 
</P>
<P>
Mac Barba was taken to UC San Diego Medical Center with unknown injuries after 
the 8:10 p.m. accident, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Within 15 minutes of the accident, passengers on the trolley, which was halted 
when Barba's wrecked 1988 Camaro became partially pinned under the front car, 
were transferred to another light-rail train. A trolley dispatcher declined to 
say how many passengers were aboard at the time of the accident, but police 
said that none was injured. 
</P>
<P>
A witness and a police officer said that Barba was crossing the intersection 
when the trolley hit him broadside and pushed him about 10 feet down the 
tracks.

It's high time the Catholic Church got off its high horse! And, for that 
matter, any other religion that does not support birth control, "safe sex," and 
pro-choice. 
</P>
<P>
If Killea's support of pro-choice put her over the top and resulted in her 
victory -- then, amen! I applaud her courage to take a stand for what she knows 
in her heart is right.

One only needs to glance around to realize that our worst problems are the

suffering the most.

CUTTING MEDICAL COSTS OF DEATH TO PROVIDE MORE CARE FOR LIVING

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a respiratory therapist and health care giver in private and county 
hospitals for the last 13 years, I applaud Schram's column. I would like to 
take the discussion one step farther to include not only the terminally ill but 
the older patient as well; specifically the older patient whose quality of life 
has deteriorated. There is big money in warehousing the elderly. Many private 
hospitals have established their own nursing homes or extended care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Schram discussed the emotion of denial. This is also the time to discuss the 
emotion of guilt -- the guilt experienced by families who feel they did not do 
"everything" for their loved one long after the quality of life had trickled 
away.

PRESIDENT BUSH CRITICIZED ON CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Attention all dictators: Feel free to openly commit mass murder upon innocent 
citizens of your country with minimal cost to your relations with the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
This is the message implicit in the Bush Administration's response to events in 
China since the massacre. The message has been underscored even further by 
Scowcroft's meeting with Deng Xiaoping, the Butcher of Beijing himself. This 
meeting came about not because of any improvement of the situation within 
China, but only because the Administration felt that contacts had been 
suspended long enough. 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, when it comes to mass murder, the President feels that six months is 
plenty of time after which to let bygones be bygones. I do not know how others 
in the U.S. react to this, but it makes me sick to my stomach.

While condemning other countries for "human rights" violations, Bush has chosen 
to ignore the blatant abuse by officials in China. The world watched in horror 
as innocent students were killed for asking for democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Lucky students escaped to the U.S. and European countries, but Bush has vetoed 
legislation to extend protection to those Chinese students who have asked to 
stay in this country. Then to add to this insensitivity, he secretly sent a 
special delegation to make peace with the same officials who violated the 
students' human rights. 
</P>
<P>
As with his predecessor, he has shown that his greatest concern is financial 
and not the well-being of people.

PRESIDENT BUSH CRITICIZED ON CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing to express my extreme disapproval of the Bush Administration's 
current policy towards China. I am enraged at our open coddling of a government 
which has so flagrantly violated the human rights of those people who are 
asking for democratic freedom. According to The Times, the only countries 
allying themselves as we are with China are North Korea, Romania and Cuba (Part 
A, Dec. 11): not exactly the kind of company I ever expected our country to be 
in. It is obvious that this Administration is interested only in furthering 
corporate interests, and not in promoting those ideals that our country is 
supposed to stand for. 
</P>
<P>
With Eastern Europe throwing off totalitarianism with the full backing of the 
United States, and the Philippines receiving our military support to ensure 
democracy there, isn't it hypocritical not to pursue the same policy in China? 
At least in El Salvador we are backing a duly elected government. Surely we 
would get further in our relations with the rest of the world by practicing 
what we preach instead of pursuing a policy of convenience. Either we support 
democracy or we don't. 
</P>
<P>
There is a lesson to be learned from our mistakes in supporting private 
interests over democracy in the cases of Cuba, Nicaragua and Iran, where our 
"allies" were ousted by popular movements because of their corrupt, tyrannical 
government. If the Chinese democratic movement should ever be successful, will 
we be their enemy or their friend? As an American citizen, I feel it is wrong 
to support dictators, whether they be on the left or on the right.

STUDY SHOWS ARTS GROUPS GIVE MUCH MORE THAN THEY GET 
</P>

<P>
San Diego arts organizations benefit the local economy more than they do 
themselves, pumping more than a quarter of a billion dollars into the economy, 
according to a study by the newly formed San Diego Cultural Arts Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Arts organizations throughout the county return $10 to the local community for 
each $1 contributed, according to the survey. But, despite having enriched the 
local economy in 1988-89 to an estimated tune of $270.4 million in direct, 
indirect and related spending, most arts organizations are barely surviving. 
</P>
<P>
Even when $31.7 million in the form of earned income (admissions, fees, 
teaching and merchandise) is added in, only a collective $4.2 million stands 
between the 70 organizations surveyed and red ink. Among theaters, that figure 
is more like $400,000, according to Alan Ziter, executive director of the San 
Diego Theatre League. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Playhouse's $750,000 deficit announced this year may be only the 
latest in a series of crises that could continue to plague theaters in this 
funding climate. According to Ziter, even the largest theaters are only 
$100,000 away from being in the red, and the smallest theaters have only a 
$10,000 margin. 
</P>
<P>
"All it takes is one show where the income doesn't come to what is expected for 
an organization to go out of business," Ziter said, commenting on the 
slenderness of the financial cushion for most local organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Stewart, managing director of the San Diego Repertory Theatre and 
founder of the San Diego Arts Coalition -- a newly formed group of more than 70 
local arts organizations -- hopes to use the survey's figures on both economic 
impact and the dedication of individuals to the arts to rally corporate and 
city support. (The survey showed patronage of 4 million, a volunteer corps of 
9,000 and $11.4 million in individual donations -- the biggest source of the 
groups' income.) 
</P>
<P>
"What we have to move away from is a series of crisis fund raising," Stewart 
said. "This sets our agenda for the '90s. There are a lot of people who care. 
There are certain organizations that need to play a role to keep institutions 
that people care about going. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fragile situation, and I believe that the real onus is back on the arts 
organizations to advocate to a whole new level of corporation (support), the 
small-size corporations, mid-size corporations," he said. "A partnership has to 
happen, and it's about more than money. It's about giving San Diego a 
reputation as a cultural destination." 
</P>
<P>
Ziter was reluctant to separate funding for different art forms, because the 
purpose of the coalition is to locate new sources of support for the arts as a 
whole, but the survey does show that dance is the least supported of San Diego 
arts, receiving a scant 1% of all contributed income and 2% of the earned 
income. 
</P>
<P>
Dance organizations are more dependent on earned income than any other 
organizations, with 76% of their money coming from ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
Theater is nearly as dependent on earned income, at 73%. Music organizations 
and museums have the most stable base, with only 60% of their money coming from 
ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
With figures like these, it's no wonder that, despite the much-ballyhooed 
health of the San Diego arts scene, there has been a financial crisis in one 
organization after another: the San Diego Opera, the San Diego Symphony, the 
San Diego Repertory Theatre and now the La Jolla Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The $270.4-million figure in the arts coalition report may seem high to those 
who remember a survey done just last year by the San Diego Chamber of Commerce. 
Max Schetter, director of the chamber's economic research bureau, used 
guidelines from the California Confederation of the Arts to come up with a 
$96-million estimate of the arts' direct and related impact in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the differences between the two surveys are that the Chamber of 
Commerce used the most conservative multiplier possible -- 2 times the number 
of admissions -- to determine related audience spending on meals, drinks, gifts 
and parking. 
</P>
<P>
The arts coalition used a multiplier of 2.78, taken from the Harvard Graduate 
School of Business Administration model used in Boston in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the chamber did not take into account indirect audience spending.

<P>
A funny thing happened on the way to Nashville, where James McMurtry hoped to 
find fame and fortune as a country singer. 
</P>
<P>
It was September, 1988, and McMurtry had had his fill of playing tiny 
roadhouses and honky-tonks in the Southwest and Alaska. He had just cut a 
demonstration tape and was eager to do some label-shopping in the Country 
Capital. 
</P>
<P>
En route, McMurtry stopped off in Washington, D.C., to play a couple of dates 
with Kinky Friedman and to visit McMurtry's father, who owned a bookstore 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Larry McMurtry, a novelist and screenwriter known for "The Last Picture Show" 
and "The Lonesome Dove," mentioned to his son that he was writing a screenplay 
with John Cougar Mellencamp. James McMurtry asked his father to pass along a 
copy of his tape "because I thought Mellencamp might know what to do with it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mellencamp did. 
</P>
<P>
"I was staying in the upstairs storeroom, and one morning a few days later I 
checked my father's answering machine and there was a message from Mellencamp," 
McMurtry recalled. "It said, 'Have your kid call me.' 
</P>
<P>
"So I called him up and the first thing he said was, 'Do you have enough songs 
for an album?' When I said no, he asked me, 'Can you write some more?' I said 
yeah, and he said, 'OK, let's make a record.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mellencamp subsequently secured McMurtry a recording contract with Columbia 
Records. The two began working on the album last February, in Mellencamp's 
Belmont Studios in Bloomington, Ind., with the producer adding a decided 
folk-rock touch. 
</P>
<P>
"Too Long in the Wasteland" was an immediate hit, critically as well as 
commercially, when it was released four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Praise began pouring in, including a review from the Boston Globe that hailed 
the album as "a tour de force of Lone Star wanderlust, small-town chatter and 
crazed relationships with lovable losers and boozers." 
</P>
<P>
The album began climbing the national charts, and its first single, "Painting 
by Numbers," was picked up by more than 100 album-rock radio stations 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
A month after the album's release, McMurtry hit the road, opening for -- and 
oftentimes stealing the show from -- the likes of Arlo Guthrie, Nanci Griffith, 
Jerry Jeff Walker and the Indigo Girls, with whom he will perform tonight at 
the California Theatre in downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
And he recently made his national television debut on "Late Night With David 
Letterman." 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry takes it all in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy to be working," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One reason McMurtry is finding all the work he can handle is timing. 
</P>
<P>
His emergence comes when folk-rock singer-songwriters are getting more 
attention than they have since the Greenwich Village days of the early 1960s. 
Among his illustrious compadres are Tracy Chapman, Suzanne Vega and Edie 
Brickell and New Bohemians. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really watch trends, but I'm glad to see these people are getting 
signed," McMurtry said. "One of the things I keep hearing is that there's this 
resurgence in literate songwriters, but it's not really a resurgence at all -- 
people like Guy Clark and Robert Earl Keene have been out doing that for years, 
but nobody paid any attention to it." 
</P>
<P>
McMurtry, 27, was born in Ft. Worth. His mother taught him to play the guitar 
when he was 7, and he began writing songs when he was 18. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I began trying to write songs," McMurtry said. "I never learned how 
to finish them until I was 25 or so." 
</P>
<P>
Did his father, the master wordsmith, give him any assistance? 
</P>
<P>
"Not really," McMurtry said. "Writing books and screenplays and writing songs 
is completely different. One is prose, the other is poetry. Prose is the long 
form -- you've got a whole book to get your story across -- whereas in songs, 
you have to say everything in three verses and a chorus, if you even want to 
write the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like choruses. I think they should be outlawed. A lot of times, people 
come up with good lines, stick them in the chorus, and then beat them to 
death." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from high school in 1980, McMurtry moved to Tucson and studied 
English for two years at the University of Arizona. He dropped out as a 
sophomore and began a new life as an itinerant musician, tending bar and 
working on farms between his infrequent bookings. 
</P>
<P>
His chance encounter with John Cougar Mellencamp may have caused his fortunes 
to soar, but it hasn't gone to his head. He harbors no change-the-world 
delusions of grandeur.

AT THE GALLERIES: SHOW COVERS RARE GROUND, BUT NOT WITH DISTINCTION

<TEXT>
<P>
When Imogen Cunningham first exhibited the photographs she made of her husband, 
nude, on Mt. Rainier in 1915, they caused such a scandal that she hid the 
negatives for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
Just this year, a painting by Eric Fischl of a nude man playing baseball sent a 
ripple of discomfort through the Chicago Public Library, where the work was on 
view. A warning was posted at the entrance to the show, stating that some 
viewers might find its contents objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
Artists and institutions alike are finally beginning to address the sexism that 
prevails within the art world, but few have acknowledged the double standard 
that has lingered within image-making itself. 
</P>
<P>
For a complex knot of historical, sociological and psychological factors too 
dense to untangle here, images of the female nude have far outnumbered those of 
the opposite sex, except, perhaps, in the art of ancient Greece. 
</P>
<P>
Recent paintings by local artists Donna Fisher and Jane Lazerow, on view at 
ArtistSpace at Southfair (2010 Jimmy Durante Blvd., Del Mar), are unusual, 
then, for their concentration on the male nude, but they are remarkable for 
little else. 
</P>
<P>
Lazerow strives for psychological drama in her paintings by surrounding a 
central male form with clusters of smaller, sketched figures that she calls 
"voices." In "Poised Before the Sea of Voices," the man strides into a mass of 
the blue, mint green and purple forms. In other works, the figure adopts 
equally conventional models' poses, which Lazerow then tries to embellish and 
embolden through garish color and clouds of "voices." 
</P>
<P>
Lazerow seems caught between academic realism and a desire for a freer, more 
expressive approach. The compromise she practices is satisfying on neither 
count, for her rendering is clumsy and her spontaneity limited. Only in one 
image, "Lizard Man, at Mother's Knee, Listening for Voices," in which she 
paints with some semblance of abandon, giving her model an unusual posture and 
painting him with slashes of ghoulishly hot color, does she procure a bit of 
tension in her work. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher's work can be as trite as Lazerow's at times, but she has more facility 
with paint and can often evoke a strong sense of emotion and place. She 
conjures moody auras in her watercolors, haunting her scenes with ghosts, 
gracing them with muses, suffusing them with melancholy or bleaching them with 
death. In "Transverberation," she paints a man, waist deep in a stream or pond, 
leaning over a floating figure. A ghostly form standing on the water's edge 
with arms crossed over its chest emanates a white light and lends an air of the 
macabre to what may be just an innocent wade. 
</P>
<P>
One 18th-Century writer on art proposed that the male nude could achieve 
character, but only the female nude could aspire to beauty. Fisher challenges 
this notion, painting her model with respect for his sensuality and ideal form. 
In her oil painting "Dithyrambus," she bathes her subject in golden light, 
seating him against a chilling landscape and a sky heavy with smoky blue 
clouds. Here, Fisher comes closest to capturing both the beauty and raw power 
of the nude male form, but, like Lazerow, she nearly smothers her intentions 
with excessive effort. 
</P>
<P>
The show, with the overbearing title "Into the Nineties: The Baroque Figure," 
continues until Feb. 11.

Jim Wardel, 51, of Chatsworth stopped to take in his handiwork: an unfinished 
English Tudor -- 3,500 square feet plus a turret -- that rises behind a tower 
of scaffolding. A free-form pool and spa, still unfilled and waiting for tile, 
sprawl across his vast back yard. 
</P>
<P>
And next to the pool, welcoming and warm in the sun, is an outdoor lounge 
chair. "You've got to be nuts!" he said with a laugh, turning away from the 
chair, back to the blocks of brick and piles of rock he's been hauling to pave 
his driveway. "Or else have an ego that's just incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Wardel, an appliance repairman, is one of the San Fernando Valley mavericks who 
are building their own houses. Nail by nail, 2-by-4 by 2-by-4. Tourists in a 
land of complicated city codes, they find that they must not only be nuts but 
supremely patient, tortuously perfectionist, physically fit, emotionally strong 
and focused -- no, better yet, obsessed. 
</P>
<P>
"I have all this energy I have to put somewhere," Wardel said. "Building my own 
house just seemed like a good, clean place to put it." 
</P>
<P>
To the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety, which oversees all 
construction, the do-it-yourself builder is "almost unknown, a thing of the 
past," said Lloyd Emery, assistant manager of the department's Van Nuys office. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 2,021 building permits for single-family houses that were issued in the 
city of Los Angeles in 1988 (1,200 of those in the Valley), the number not 
being built by professionals was "in the Valley, maybe 10," Emery said. "In the 
city of Los Angeles, you cannot go out into the forest and build a log cabin 
and sit it on the earth. You cannot. It is more complicated than that." 
</P>
<P>
Complication No. 1 is the sheer expense. "Housing is at an absolute premium," 
said Art Johnson, assistant chief of the building department's Bureau of 
Community Safety in Los Angeles. "Just look at the high value of land and the 
prices and rents of dwellings, which have escalated tremendously in the last 
five years. There's no more room to spread out." 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the city issued 2,258 building permits for single-family homes, whose 
total value after construction was $189,332,023, or an average of $83,849 per 
house. In 1988, the median value of a newly built house rose to $214,159. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so expensive to build that you can't afford the luxury of mistakes," said 
Johnson. What's more, he added, the city's particularly complex building codes, 
which take into account the area's high vulnerability to fire and earthquake, 
mean that the pitfalls awaiting the inexperienced non-professional are 
enormous. 
</P>
<P>
Said one building inspector: "They're a strange and very brave breed -- the 
guys who try to do it all themselves. They're really up against it." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, J. Austin Ivey, now 72 -- nicknamed Awesome at the Simi Valley 
stereo manufacturing company where he works in the wood shop -- cut his teeth 
on a 1,040-square-foot "flat-on-a-slab job" he built in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
His father, then 73, was his only helper. "There was nothing to it," said 
Austin, a former Granada Hills High School wood shop teacher. Today, he and his 
wife, Katharina, 51, stand on the 180-degree deck of their 2,500-square-foot 
home atop a Malibu mountain. 
</P>
<P>
It is this second do-it-yourself effort, which is complete with soaring 
cathedral ceilings, that Austin calls his swan song. "A house being built by 
one man is about endurance," said Katharina of their second project, begun in 
1980 and not quite finished. "Tremendous, tremendous endurance. It's about 
slow-and-steady, and precision. As I learned on this project. Austin's got to 
be precise down to the 1/32nd. He'll keep at it until he is." 
</P>
<P>
Austin, who says that his own age group is "just too tired" to relate to, said 
building his own house has been a fitting metaphor for who he is. "A rebel," 
his wife said. 
</P>
<P>
Austin said he should have been born 200 years ago, when "there was more of the 
challenge of providing things for yourself. I don't like to let others do 
things for me because they're not as fussy. It's a damned old-maid attitude, 
but I'll go to great ends to see something done right." 
</P>
<P>
And, to the Iveys, their dream house is done right. Built on land they bought 
in 1980 for $62,500, the house and property today are worth at least $700,000, 
they say. Flawless redwood outside, impeccable oak inside (Austin handpicked 
each board), there are double-paned wood windows, masterfully crafted kitchen 
cabinets and details throughout that are reflective of Austin's lifelong hobby 
of woodworking. 
</P>
<P>
Katharina recalls that when the building inspector came to approve Austin's 
work, he said, "I've never seen a house as well-built this side of Sepulveda." 
</P>
<P>
"What about the other side?" said Austin, always fond of a joke. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem with these one-man operations is that they're really, 
really slow," Johnson said. "The romance of doing it yourself wears off quick 
after, in the back-breaking work, you've chopped off a finger, sawed off a leg; 
the one-day trench turns into three weeks, the neighbors are howling at the 
mess, and the checks get written and written and written." 
</P>
<P>
Professional contractors are generally in and out of a project in six months or 
less. Do-it-yourselfers, who generally pay as they go, often are slowed by a 
lack of cash, design miscalculations and building mistakes that entangle them 
in the building department's approval process, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
To get a building permit, all building plans (drawn to scale in blueprint-like 
form) first must be approved by city structural engineers, who check that codes 
are met for property grading, foundations, framing, heating, wiring, plumbing 
-- the virtually thousands of requirements that ensure home occupants' health 
and safety. Houses built on hillsides (here many do-it-yourselfers build; in 
the Valley, the northwest and far west areas are particularly popular), 
complicate the process further because they require soil analyses, erosion 
studies, geological surveys and more. If all goes smoothly, a plan approval 
takes 20 days to two months. 
</P>
<P>
But for an inexperienced builder, it can be a veritable agony of plan revision 
and delay, say building department workers. 
</P>
<P>
"When cold reality hits the dream, there's quite a reckoning," said John 
Hasselbrink, senior inspector with the building department's Van Nuys office. 
"These guys come in knowing nothing more than what they picked up reading the 
Time-Life series on building, and we have to say, 'That parapet on your castle? 
Gotta go. That moat? It's gotta have a pool enclosure.' We say no, no, no to 
their big plans and send them away with three pages of corrections to be made. 
It isn't pretty." 
</P>
<P>
After a building permit finally is issued, the do-it-yourselfer still is not 
out of the woods. For instance, said Dominic Rescineto, a 30-year inspector 
with the department's Los Angeles office, "A guy will spend months doing 
something like the concrete and stand back pleased. Then the inspector, whose 
job is to follow the project making sure all city codes are met, will waltz 
over and say, 'Nope, gotta tear it all out.' The guy's not generally too 
receptive to this kind of rejection." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, actors Richard and Aza McKenzie, in their 50s, had just finished 
remodeling their North Hollywood home -- with professional help -- when friends 
presented an unusual challenge. "They said, 'Why don't you build your own 
house?' " Aza recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"We just looked at each other, and that was it. We always were crazy." They sit 
in the loft bedroom of their 2,200-square-foot home, nestled in the forest of 
Topanga Canyon. It is cozy, charming and spacious, since one huge room 
downstairs contains the kitchen, dining area and living room. An original 
McKenzie design, it is a variation on a New England saltbox. 
</P>
<P>
"Doing it all yourself," said Richard, "means you get anything your wild 
imagination dares. You're free from anyone's tract ideas." An enormous arched 
window, salvaged from a demolished Spanish mansion, and the front door, a 
Brentwood home's castoff with stained-glass inlay, are only two of the couple's 
finds that make their house unique. Both were found through the Recycler -- the 
Los Angeles paper crammed with classified ads for used merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had a great time!" Aza said with a laugh. They acquired their lot for 
$44,000. For the 2 1/2 years it took Richard to erect their romantic dream 
house, the McKenzies got a kick out of living in a small trailer next to the 
project. "It felt like we were on a trip, a quite adventurous one at that," Aza 
said. At one time, the couple lived on a boat when they both were working in 
East Coast theater. She added, "Of course, we're a particular type. Very, very 
flexible." Her husband said, "To do this (build your own house), you have to 
be. And let's face it, most people aren't." 
</P>
<P>
If a do-it-yourselfer estimates his cost and then triples it, only then will he 
"be able to relax," Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
Solo builders tend to lose out on the discounts on lumber and materials given 
such high-volume buyers as shopping center developers. And any money they might 
save on labor usually is chewed up by their fierce insistence on quality, 
according to building department observers. Said one do-it-yourselfer: "Because 
my house was my baby, completely, I put in all the best stuff -- central 
vacuum, central intercom, master bathroom spa. What I saved doing it myself 
covered the extras. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course," he added, "it also covered all my mistakes, the things I had to 
tear out and redo." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, building a house is "like buying a bag of groceries," said Arthur Dorn 
of A &amp; D Builders in Tarzana. "If you fill it with bread, you're going to 
go cheap. But fill it with filet mignon. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Before the mid-1970s, when California building codes were restrictive and a 
1,200-square-foot, one-story, one-bath house was all people wanted, the 
do-it-yourselfer was everywhere, said Bill King, chief building mechanical 
inspector at the building department in Van Nuys, who built his own Valencia 
home. "But in this day and age of simple room additions that go on for 15 years 
because people don't have the time or interest to master all the crafts 
involved, to actually build a house yourself, you usually have to be in a 
unique circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
"Like if it's your retirement home and you've got forever to piddle with the 
endless, endless details," he continued. "Or if building is like therapy for 
you." Or maybe, he said, with a laugh, "you've just got to love problems." 
</P>
<P>
There are irate neighbors, for example. Katharina Ivey recalled the beautiful 
spring day when Austin was swinging a hammer on his Woodland Hills house. "This 
man next door couldn't take it anymore and yelled, 'I've heard of Rome not 
being built in a day, but this is ridiculous!' " 
</P>
<P>
There is near-death fatigue. "It's so tough," King said. "So, so tough. Every 
day, get off work, change clothes, go out there, pound nails until dark. Every 
weekend, push, push, push to get it finished. You could drop dead. There's no 
break." 
</P>
<P>
And there are long-suffering wives. "Oh, I was really depressed when he started 
this," Katharina Ivey said of Austin's mountaintop Shangri-La. "He hauls me up 
here to live in unfinished business, in these sticks of lumber, dust and nails. 
The house is so consuming, there were times I thought I'd never see the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion again." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, say the lone-wolf builders, nothing is as difficult to deal with in the 
do-it-yourself house project as their own perfectionism. 
</P>
<P>
"If your wall is an eighth off and you've got a good eye, you see all the 
shadows," Wardel said. "And you're crazy because the shadows aren't right. You 
can put wallpaper on it, but you know, underneath, it's . . . well, it's not 
right." 
</P>
<P>
In his zealous insistence on such perfection, Wardel fired most of the 
occasional subcontractors or laborers he hired to help. 
</P>
<P>
Richard McKenzie understands such fanaticism. "It's a fight every inch of the 
way," he said, "to be willing to leave a job alone, to force yourself to say, 
'Oh well, the trim will cover that up.' " 
</P>
<P>
He added, "There comes a time when you're just trying to get through. Forget 
art!" 
</P>
<P>
Such an "emotionally consuming project is definitely not for everyone," said 
King. "You have to be unique. You have to be patient. You have to have a high 
frustration level. You have to be physically and emotionally stable, and have a 
real objective perspective of your relationships and abilities. Because 
building a house yourself is the ultimate test. Of everything. 
</P>
<P>
"And if you can't be obsessed," he added, "or you have other things in your 
life, like children or boating on weekends, then it's probably better to go 
hire someone and say, 'Call me when it's done.' " 
</P>
<P>
When the Iveys' house was done, after Austin had finished fussing with the 
finish work in their new bedroom and Katharina could spend her first night 
there listening to the silence high above the Valley lights, she was 
overwhelmed with her husband's accomplishment. "I just lay in this beautiful 
room, where every detail was Austin's pride, and I was saying over and over, 'I 
can't believe you did this. I can't believe you actually did it,' " she said. 
"My respect for his drive, his tenacity . . . well, I've never been happier in 
my life!"

HOW TO KEEP IN GOOD VOICE? TAKE A LESSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whether you are interviewing for a job, making a presentation or meeting a new 
client, how do you make yourself sound credible, authoritative and confident? 
</P>
<P>
William Rush, a professional voice consultant, says it is a matter of 
"practicing good vocal habits throughout your life." 
</P>
<P>
Rush, who established his own voice consulting firm in Chicago in 1983, has 
coached commodity traders who want to yell louder, trial lawyers who want to 
sound more persuasive and performers from the Broadway show "Annie," who wanted 
to build their endurance to sing and speak more effectively. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I tell my clients is that there are no magical shortcuts to 
take for maintaining the quality of your voice," he said. "Instead, vocal 
conservation begins and ends with a dedication to practicing good vocal habits 
throughout your life." 
</P>
<P>
Rush divides his clients into two categories: heavy users -- teachers, 
telemarketers, coaches -- who constantly use and strain their voices, and 
moderate users -- executives, secretaries, salespeople -- who do not have to 
speak as forcefully. 
</P>
<P>
He then teaches each group the four fundamentals of vocal effectiveness -- 
breath, pitch, articulation and flow -- as it applies to them. 
</P>
<P>
"To conserve their voices, I stress the importance of avoiding caffeine, 
alcohol and cigarettes, all of which will dry the throat," he said. "Instead, I 
advise my clients to drink lots of water and juices, and to keep their home and 
work area properly humidified." 
</P>
<P>
Rush, who is a consultant to the Halls Mentho-Lyptus Voice Improvement Program, 
also recommends using a eucalyptus-based cough tablet to soothe a scratchy 
throat and avoiding dairy products and chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
"The best ammunition in the war against vocal chord abuse is prevention," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During a job interview, Rush recommended the following: 
</P>
<P>
Realize that you will be nervous. Take a few deep breaths to make it easier for 
you to speak. 
</P>
<P>
* Maintain a pitch that will allow you to speak loudly without straining -- 
usually about five notes above the lowest note you can sing easily. 
</P>
<P>
* Avoid vocal traps. If the interviewer is responding to your answers in a 
noncommittal way, be sure your voice retains its enthusiastic quality. 
</P>
<P>
* Remember to enunciate consonant sounds. If you don't, it can sound like 
mumbling. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep your shoulders back and your spine straight, but be flexible enough so 
that you're not gasping for breath. You want to speak with clarity and ease. 
</P>
<P>
* Pause briefly after each important thought or word to add emphasis. Use 
pauses to pace yourself to ensure that the interviewer gets your point. 
</P>
<P>
* Try to anticipate the questions that you might be asked. You will convey your 
response more confidently when they do come up. 
</P>
<P>
* Speak in declarative sentences to sound more assured. 
</P>

WAR ON NARCOTICS: RODRIGUEZ GACHA WAS A LEADER OF THE MEDELLIN CARTEL. U.S. 
HAILS THE 'FIRST BIG BREAK WE'VE HAD.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In their single biggest victory in the drug war, Colombian police Friday shot 
and killed notorious narcotics trafficker Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, who as a 
leader of the Medellin cartel waged a campaign of terror to maintain the 
world's biggest cocaine empire. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez Gacha and six others, including his son, Freddy Rodriguez Celades, 
had resisted a 72-hour siege before they died in a half-hour gun battle with an 
elite police unit that had tracked them to a remote hide-out on the nation's 
Caribbean coast, Colombian authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
The death of the man known as El Mexicano reflected a stunning reversal in a 
government crackdown that had failed for four months to apprehend any of the 
cadre of kingpins most wanted by the United States and Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first big break we've had," declared acting Drug Enforcement 
Administration chief Terrence M. Burke. 
</P>
<P>
In a hastily arranged news conference in Washington, drug czar William J. 
Bennett hailed the action as a symbol of the determination of the Colombian 
government to confront the traffickers despite their pledge to wage "all-out 
war" on citizens and officials. 
</P>
<P>
Both Bennett and Burke declined to speculate on the potential impact of 
Rodriguez Gacha's death on the overall war on drugs. Another official, however, 
said that the action had provided an enormous confidence boost to anti-drug 
officials, who often before had seen powerful traffickers slip through 
Colombian authorities' grasp. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the one we've been hoping for," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
President Virgilio Barco Vargas of Colombia officially informed the United 
States of Rodriguez Gacha's death in a late-afternoon telephone conversation 
with Bennett, the Bush Administration's top anti-drug official. 
</P>
<P>
According to Bennett, Barco stressed that the operation was "very important 
psychologically" for a Colombian people traumatized by months of bombings and 
assassinations ordered by cartel leaders who seemed invulnerable to the 
much-touted government crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
"President Barco now believes that doubts about the Colombian government's 
resolve and ability to defeat the cartel should now recede," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
Together with his Medellin cartel associate Pablo Escobar, the 42-year-old 
Rodriguez Gacha ranked as the trafficker most wanted by the Colombian 
government, which for more than a month has focused its anti-drug crackdown 
around operations designed to find the two fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
He was also near the top of a Justice Department list of the "Dirty Dozen" 
traffickers targeted by U.S. officials as kingpins whom the United States wants 
to extradite to this country to face trial under long-pending indictments. 
</P>
<P>
While his death eliminates Rodriguez Gacha as a potential source of 
intelligence, officials expressed no remorse about the violent demise of the 
man who reaped billions of dollars from the cocaine cartel accused of ordering 
dozens of murders and implicated in the August assassination of presidential 
candidate Luis Carlos Galan. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez Gacha "was a very significant man -- a man who had killed many 
innocents -- men, women and children," Barco said in the message relayed by the 
U.S. officials late Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"President Barco remains determined to pursue cartel fugitives," Bennett said. 
"And the United States remains determined to do everything in its power to 
support President Barco and the government of Colombia in this effort." 
</P>
<P>
The death of a single trafficker -- even one as powerful as Rodriguez Gacha -- 
is unlikely by itself to have an adverse impact on an enterprise as vast and 
sophisticated as the Medellin cartel, analysts cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
"You can cut off the head, but this body keeps kicking," said one congressional 
source. 
</P>
<P>
But they said that the death of Rodriguez Gacha could further disrupt the 
trafficking operations by driving home to other narcotraficantes the message 
that the government crackdown knows no bounds. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman (R-N.Y.), the ranking minority member of the House 
Narcotics Committee, described the cartel leader's death as an indication "that 
enforcement is starting to work." 
</P>
<P>
The congressman, who with five other committee members returned to Washington 
on Friday from a trip to Colombia, said that the episode should counter 
widespread doubts about the ability of Colombia's government to fight the 
super-rich cartels, which have used bribery, terrorism and murder to maintain 
their power. 
</P>
<P>
"As one of the victims of the bombing of the national police headquarters told 
us, 'Don't judge the Colombian people by a few bad apples,' " Gilman said. "On 
the whole, I think the top people there don't want to lose their country to the 
drug cartels, and they will fight to win."

The Colombian president had come under increasing attack by citizens who were 
troubled by his government's apparent powerlessness in the face of the 
traffickers' campaign of terror, blamed for bombings in recent weeks aboard an 
Avianca jetliner and in a downtown street that together killed more than 150 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting widespread discontent, Colombia's House of Representatives voted 
this week to allow voters to decide in a national referendum whether 
extradition of the traffickers should continue. But its Senate, by a slim 
margin, appeared to have derailed the effort Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The domestic boost that President Barco is likely to win from the successful 
effort is also important to the United States, which regards him as a vital 
instrument in its stepped-up effort to extend its war on drugs to the Andean 
nations that are the source of all but a tiny fraction of the world's cocaine 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials have freely acknowledged that a success in Colombia, 
which has been granted $65 million in emergency U.S. assistance to bolster its 
fight, was vital to the prospects of their entire Andean strategy. Indeed, 
those officials had turned increasingly testy in recent weeks when asked to 
cite indications of progress. 
</P>
<P>
The frustrating manhunt for Rodriguez Gacha and Escobar -- each of whom was the 
subject of a $625,000 reward offered by the Colombian government -- probably 
allowed other traffickers to resume the massive shipments of cocaine that had 
been disrupted in the early weeks of the crackdown, U.S. officials in Colombia 
said recently. 
</P>
<P>
But the officials defended the Colombian preoccupation with the two men on 
grounds that their records of murder and mayhem made their apprehension 
indispensable if the Colombian government was to demonstrate that it had 
confronted the cartels head-on. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez Gacha was said by security officials to have narrowly escaped 
numerous attempts to capture him, including an episode last August when 
residents tipped him off shortly before security forces were about to close in 
at a discotheque in his hometown of Pacho. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez Gacha grew up poor, and his formal education was limited to grade 
school. But his friendly manners and ruthless ways made him a success in the 
cutthroat world of emerald smuggling, where he made his first fortune while 
learning the skills that would make him one of the most powerful of cocaine 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Known as El Mexicano because of his fascination with Mexican culture, Rodriguez 
Gacha owned a string of ranches with such Mexican names as Chihuahua, Sonora 
and Mazatlan. 
</P>
<P>
Among many of his countrymen, he was a popular celebrity whose friends 
apparently included national police and military officers. At home in Pacho, an 
intelligence official said, "He had the sympathy of the majority of the town."

CZECHS WILL CUT ARMY, REMOVE FORTIFICATIONS; 
</P>

EAST BLOC: THE DEFENSE CHIEF ALSO SAYS STEPS ARE BEING TAKEN TO END COMMUNIST 
PARTY CELLS IN THE MILITARY.

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defense Minister Miroslav Vacek announced Friday that Czechoslovakia will begin 
immediately to reduce the size of its army and remove the fortifications along 
its border with West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"The army does not need these barriers for the defense of our country," Gen. 
Vacek said at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Vacek declined to give specific figures on the extent of the reduction planned 
for the military. Present strength is put at roughly 200,000. The only specific 
figure he gave was that the armed forces will require 90,000 fewer reservists 
next year than planned. 
</P>
<P>
But it is clear that the new steps, coming at the same time as negotiations on 
the withdrawal of about 70,000 Soviet troops, will mark a significant reduction 
in the militarization of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Vacek said he supports the goal of removing Soviet troops, although "as a 
soldier" he would prefer to see the reduction done in the context of overall 
troop cuts by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Vacek said, the military command is taking steps to remove 
politics from the army, eliminating the Communist Party cells in the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Communist Party Presidium announced that party cells will be 
eliminated from the internal security services, prosecutors' offices, 
government ministries and the border patrol, yet another step in the party's 
retreat from power. Party officials continue to insist, however, that they 
should retain the authority to organize party units in workplaces. These have 
been under attack here and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The announcements came as Czechoslovakia's new government, in which Communists 
are a minority, concentrated on the tasks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
At the Communications Ministry, officials announced new steps designed to 
restrict telephone tapping. But Deputy Prime Minister Jan Carnogursky admitted 
that the government must move carefully as it works to bring the security 
forces under the rule of law. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus pledged to resist pressure for higher wages, 
which he admitted is certain to come after the government begins devaluing the 
currency and reducing subsidies to allow the economy to be opened to the 
international market. 
</P>
<P>
Government leaders met with wealthy Czechoslovak expatriate Thomas Bata, an 
industrialist now based in Canada, but they heard no pledge of new investment 
to help modernize the economy. Instead, at a press conference, Bata repeated 
his long-standing demand that Czechoslovakia return to him factories that were 
nationalized after World War II. "We are not dealing with the question of 
investment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Petr Miller said he had replaced several senior deputies with a 
new team that will support the government's economic plans. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said his aides were drawing up a list of senior Communist Party 
officials who have been drawing unauthorized government pensions. The full 
list, which includes several prominent names, will be made public after it is 
presented to the Cabinet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The pensions will join a long list of publicized financial abuses that have 
diminished what remained of the Communists' credibility with the people. The 
financial abuses revealed so far do not appear to be as flagrant as those that 
have outraged citizens of neighboring East Germany. But Czechoslovak television 
has carried frequent reports of special mountain lodges reserved for party 
members, houses sold to party insiders at reduced prices and similar forms of 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
As public disgust with the party mounts, the fight over party cells in 
factories could be the Communists' last stand. Such cells have existed in 
Czechoslovakia since the 1920s, two decades before the party took power here, 
the Communists argue. Rather than eliminate the cells, they argue, others 
should be created by other parties. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the anti-Communist Civic Forum argue that the cells have been a key 
means by which the party kept control over society, using them to monitor 
political dissent and to guarantee good jobs for party members. The 
organizations will have to be closed to eliminate these practices, they say.

BLOCH SPY TRIAL UNLIKELY; FBI LACKS EVIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The FBI, after more than seven months of exhaustive investigation, has failed 
to find solid evidence to support espionage charges against career diplomat 
Felix S. Bloch and has all but abandoned hopes of prosecuting him, sources 
familiar with the case said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury has heard testimony from a series of witnesses, including 
an Austrian prostitute linked to Bloch, the sources said, and FBI agents have 
completed a painstaking "Capone-like" examination of his finances, a reference 
to the government's successful tax case against mobster Al Capone. 
</P>
<P>
But neither the grand jury proceedings nor the financial reconstruction yielded 
sufficient evidence to confirm FBI suspicions that the veteran State Department 
official accepted payments from the Soviets in exchange for U.S. government 
secrets, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
With only limited long-shot leads still to be checked in Europe, the FBI 
sharply cut back its surveillance of Bloch earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
In what may be the only action taken against Bloch, the State Department is 
expected to move soon to remove him from its payroll. He has continued to draw 
his $78,600 annual salary since his suspension June 22. 
</P>
<P>
"This is coming out the worst possible way," one official said. "The bureau is 
criticized for heavy-handedness for the public surveillance that was maintained 
primarily to stop him from disappearing. And (bringing) no charges makes the 
FBI look like the guilty party." 
</P>
<P>
Failure to bring charges against Bloch would magnify what has already been a 
highly embarrassing episode for the State Department, FBI and Justice 
Department and leave unknown the extent of the damage he allegedly caused to 
national security. 
</P>
<P>
It also would renew questions about the fairness of Bloch's treatment by the 
government, which officially acknowledged suspicions against him that, in the 
end, it could not prove, and which conducted an extraordinarily public 
surveillance that made him a media event. 
</P>
<P>
For months, FBI agents had monitored Bloch's Washington residence around the 
clock, accompanied him on walks and followed him on trips to New York and other 
destinations, often trailed by an entourage of reporters and cameramen. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to reduce surveillance came after Justice Department officials, 
lacking cause to bring charges, questioned whether agents legitimately could 
take any action to prevent Bloch from seeking asylum in the Soviet Embassy or 
otherwise fleeing the country. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch's lawyer, John M. Bray, declined to comment on his client's affairs, and 
official spokesmen for the FBI and Justice Department would not discuss the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch, who could not be reached for comment Friday, has spoken cryptically 
about the investigation in the past. In August, for example, he was urged by an 
interviewer for the Austrian magazine Profil to declare that he was not a spy. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Bloch replied: "There are suspicions but there is no proof. They have 
to prove my guilt." 
</P>
<P>
Bloch, a 30-year veteran of the Foreign Service, served as the second-ranking 
officer at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, a sensitive crossroads post, until he 
returned in 1987 to the State Department to head the office handling regional 
affairs for the European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, sources said, U.S. intelligence officials intercepted an overseas 
phone call to Bloch from a KGB "illegal," or undercover intelligence agent, who 
used the pseudonym Pierre. Based on that call, the FBI asked French agents to 
monitor a meeting in a Paris restaurant between the two men. 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Bloch allegedly passed a travel bag to the agent, identified by 
U.S. intelligence officials as Reino Gikman, a Soviet spy who traveled 
undercover as a Finnish computer salesman. The meeting was understood to have 
been photographed by the French agents. 
</P>
<P>
In June, U.S. intelligence officials intercepted another international call 
between the two men, during which the Soviet agent, using cryptic terms, seemed 
to try to warn Bloch that both men could be under surveillance, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the FBI greatly expanded its surveillance of Bloch and no longer 
took pains to remain covert. The State Department placed Bloch on 
administrative leave with pay, took back his building pass and removed his 
nameplate from his office door, leaving a gaping hole. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, the investigation was reported by ABC News and subsequently 
confirmed by the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with FBI agents, Bloch maintained that he knew Gikman only as a 
fellow stamp collector, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with the investigation said the grand jury had questioned a 
former Austrian prostitute named Tina, who in July told Austrian police that 
Bloch had paid her more than $750 a night for sexual services. 
</P>
<P>
She now works as a waitress in a Viennese coffeehouse, and Austrian security 
officials said they are "certain" that she had no connection with any espionage 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. sources said it is difficult to assess what damage Bloch may have done if 
he revealed secrets to the Soviets. He had wide access to economic data in his 
latest assignment, and he had enjoyed even broader access to sensitive material 
while at the Vienna embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Before his June 22 suspension, Bloch allegedly made an incriminating admission 
in an intercepted conversation with his wife, Lucille. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, problems associated with the investigation have hampered the 
government's ability to remove Bloch from the government's payroll. 
</P>
<P>
Under State Department regulations, if Secretary of State James A. Baker III 
decides to fire Bloch, he must provide written notice in advance and give Bloch 
an opportunity to reply. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch then could request a hearing before the Foreign Service Grievance Board, 
which would convene an arbitration panel consisting of an outside attorney and 
two retired Foreign Service officers. 
</P>
<P>
The department would be required to present evidence to the panel to convince 
it that the separation is justified, and the panel could set its own rules of 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Hearings under the procedure normally would be closed, but they could be opened 
-- or their records released -- if Bloch so requested. And if the panel decided 
against Bloch, he could appeal the ruling to the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, the State Department proposed an amendment to the Foreign Service 
Act that would have allowed Baker to suspend Bloch -- or any other Foreign 
Service officer -- without pay if there was "reasonable cause to believe that 
(the officer) has committed a job-related crime." 
</P>
<P>
"It clearly applied to Bloch," a State Department official familiar with the 
issue said. 
</P>
<P>
But the American Foreign Service Assn., the union representing U.S. diplomats, 
succeeded in watering down the amendment. Under the final version of the law 
approved by Congress, Baker can suspend a Foreign Service officer who has been 
convicted of a crime but not one who is merely under suspicion.

President Bush canceled a trip to Manhattan and a speech Friday night to the 
80th convention of the NAACP because he had laryngitis. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the trip was scrapped, Bush's prepared address had been shortened 
to about eight minutes because of his ailment. 
</P>
<P>
White House officials also had considered the possibility that Bush would go to 
New York and sit on the stage as his speech was delivered by one of his aides, 
Roger Porter. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the White House said Bush's laryngitis and deteriorating weather 
conditions in New York prompted the decision to cancel the trip. The National 
Weather Service issued a storm warning for New York and predicted possible 
heavy snow, accumulating four to six inches, along with heavy winds. 
</P>
<P>
The White House said the prospect of poor visibility would have curtailed plans 
for Bush to fly by helicopter from Newark to mid-town Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the trip's cancellation came too late for dozens of members 
of the White House press corps. They had flown ahead of the President on a 
chartered airliner and were landing in Newark when the decision was made to 
drop the trip.

CONVICTIONS OVERTURNED FOR 5 LEADING SOUTH AFRICAN BLACK ACTIVISTS; 
</P>
<P>
APARTHEID: THEY ARE FREED FROM PRISON AND ARE GREETED BY SINGING COLLEAGUES.

<TEXT>
<P>
Five leading anti-apartheid activists, convicted last year in a historic 
treason trial that dealt a sharp blow to black protest in South Africa, were 
freed from prison Friday after the country's highest court overturned their 
convictions. 
</P>
<P>
"We're overjoyed to be back with our families," Popo Molefe, 37, general 
secretary of the United Democratic Front, said in an interview on the plane 
taking him home to Johannesburg. "But it's unfortunate we had to lose four 
years of our lives to prison when it was so patently clear from the beginning 
that we had committed no crime." 
</P>
<P>
The men, including two other senior UDF leaders, were greeted in Johannesburg 
by more than 400 black, white, Indian and mixed-race activists who clogged the 
airport arrival hall, singing liberation songs and holding up freshly painted 
signs saying, "Welcome Home Comrades." 
</P>
<P>
As the freed men were carried away on the shoulders of the crowd, policemen 
scuffled with well-wishers, briefly arresting several people, including the 
Rev. Allan Boesak, who had gone to the aid of a woman bitten by a police dog. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 convictions, after one of South Africa's longest and most important 
political trials, were overturned by the Appeal Court in Bloemfontein. The 
court ruled that the trial judge, Kees van Dijkhorst, had improperly dismissed 
one of two legal experts assisting him as being too sympathetic to the UDF. The 
assistant had signed a UDF petition in 1983 opposing a new constitution that 
excluded blacks from representation in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
In Cape Town, lawyers, family members and friends greeted the men as they 
arrived on a ferry from Robben Island prison. At the Cape Town airport, 
Anglican Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu led the men and their supporters in a 
prayer. 
</P>
<P>
"We thank you, Lord, that the halls of justice have vindicated our brothers," 
the 1984 Nobel laureate said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Van Dijkhorst, who presided over the 3 1/2-year trial, ruled that the UDF 
plotted to violently overthrow the white minority-led government. He said UDF 
protests had led directly and intentionally to bloody township riots that swept 
the country in the years 1984-86. 
</P>
<P>
The case acquired prominence as a trial of the 2-million-member UDF itself and, 
by implication, other government opponents who considered themselves part of 
the liberation struggle. The front, formed in 1983, is a multiracial coalition 
of more than 600 anti-apartheid groups. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two defendants, including clergymen, teachers and community leaders from 
the Vaal River region south of Johannesburg, where the first wave of unrest 
flared five years ago, were charged with treason, subversion, terrorism and 
murder. Half were acquitted at various stages. 
</P>
<P>
The Appeal Court action overturned the remaining 11 convictions, including 
those of six men who had received suspended sentences for terrorism. The three 
UDF leaders and one of their co-defendants, a church worker, had been sentenced 
to terms ranging from six to 12 years for treason. A fifth man, a member of a 
UDF-affiliated group, was convicted of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the defendants were granted bail during the trial, but the judge denied 
bail for the three UDF leaders, who have been in prison since their arrests in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
Human rights lawyers, calling the appeal ruling "an excellent victory," 
demanded that the government disclose how much was spent on "this abortive 
prosecution, which took years of blundering incompetence to achieve nothing but 
red faces." 
</P>
<P>
The UDF, which the government said was the internal wing of the outlawed 
African National Congress, has been effectively banned since February, 1987, 
under state-of-emergency regulations. But in recent months President Frederik 
W. de Klerk has loosened the grip on anti-apartheid activity, allowing dozens 
of rallies, including those organized by recently freed leaders of the ANC. 
</P>
<P>
"If the regime thought it was breaking the movement by bringing these charges 
in the first place, it made a serious mistake," Molefe said. He said the freed 
men intend to return to active roles in the anti-apartheid struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Those freed Friday, in addition to Molefe, were Patrick Lekota, 41, the front's 
publicity secretary, Moses Chikane, 41, secretary of the Transvaal branch of 
the UDF, the Rev. Tom Manthata, 49, a church field worker, and Gcinu Muzi 
Malindi, of the UDF-affiliated Vaal Civic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
They were imprisoned on Robben Island in Cape Town harbor, where many political 
prisoners have been held. Lekota and Chikane have daughters who were born after 
they were imprisoned in 1985 and have never seen their fathers as free men.

<P>
Gen. Manuel A. Noriega's rubber-stamp legislature Friday named him chief 
executive of Panama and gave him sweeping powers to confront U.S. efforts to 
oust the combative general. 
</P>
<P>
"The Republic of Panama is declared to be in a state of war while the (U.S.) 
aggression lasts," the People's Assembly said in a resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"To confront this aggression, the job of chief of government of Panama is 
hereby created, and Manuel Antonio Noriega is designated to carry out these 
responsibilities as maximum leader for national liberation." 
</P>
<P>
As head of the government, Noriega holds the same title as the late dictator 
Gen. Omar Torrijos, his mentor. Torrijos died in a 1981 plane crash, and within 
two years Noriega gained the real power when he became commander of Panama's 
Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
The 510 members of the People's Assembly passed the resolution by acclamation, 
and Speaker Fermin Herrera swore in Noriega on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, 52, already was "coordinator" of the assembly and chief of the Defense 
Forces. 
</P>
<P>
The assembly gave him power to appoint public officials, control foreign 
relations, convene the assembly and "make decisions on whatever other matter or 
unforeseen circumstance" affects the nation's interests. 
</P>
<P>
Provisional President Francisco Rodriguez's position was expected to become a 
largely ceremonial post. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega is wanted in the United States on federal drug trafficking and money 
laundering charges, and Washington has tried to oust him from power for 2 1/2 
years with diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
He has survived those efforts, however, and military coup attempts in March, 
1988, and last October. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the "state of war" declared 
by the National Assembly and its naming of Noriega as head of government would 
have no effect on an already hostile U.S. attitude toward Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's action is another hollow step in an attempt to force his rule on the 
Panamanian people," Fitzwater said Friday in Washington. "The actions of the 
National Assembly will not detract the focus from the fact that Noriega has 
thwarted the desires of the Panamanian people for democratic rule." 
</P>
<P>
A State Department official said the action "doesn't mean anything." 
</P>
<P>
To underscore that view, the Pentagon reported no increase in the alert status 
of the more than 10,000 American troops in Panama. White House officials 
regarded the announcement from Panama as so insignificant that they did not 
immediately inform President Bush after he left the Oval Office early, 
suffering from a raspy voice. 
</P>
<P>
In Panama City, a few thousand Noriega supporters surrounded the assembly and 
cheered when it broadened Noriega's powers.

President Bush, in a message of condolence, praised Andrei D. Sakharov's 
courage and devotion to freedom Friday and said the Nobel Peace Prize winner 
was an example of goodness and decency. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us who knew him will never forget his courage and devotion to freedom. 
During the darkest hours of his struggle for human rights in the Soviet Union 
he embodied all that is good and decent in the human spirit," Bush said in a 
message to Sakharov's widow, Yelena Bonner. 
</P>
<P>
According to White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, Bush also cited Sakharov's 
recent efforts in the Soviet Congress to expand political freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan, who exchanged views on human rights with 
Sakharov during an emotional November, 1988, meeting in the White House, issued 
the following statement: 
</P>
<P>
"Andrei Sakharov was a man of great principle and a true general in the fight 
for human rights. His courage, his eloquence and his unshakable belief in the 
dignity of man was an inspiration to us all. Now, as his vision of freedom for 
all mankind begins to become a reality, we mourn his passing but take comfort 
in knowing that his work and spirit will live on forever." 
</P>
<P>
In London, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who met often with the 
human rights champion said fate had been cruel to Sakharov, who died just as 
his dream for a more democratic Soviet Union seemed within grasp. 
</P>
<P>
In Gdansk, Poland, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Sakharov's death was a 
blow for the pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said Sakharov, a non-Jew, will 
always be remembered for helping Soviet Jews fight for the right to emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
Natan Sharansky, former refusenik and prisoner of conscience who, with 
Sakharov, represented the most visible symbol of the fight for freedom in the 
pre-perestroika Soviet Union, said the Jewish world had lost one of its best 
friends.

<P>
A 'FATEFUL MOMENT' IN EUROPE FORESEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The "fateful moment" has yet to occur in the historic drama of Eastern Europe, 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell said Friday -- that moment when the 
leaders of the Kremlin may have to decide whether to reverse the course of 
change on the Continent and try to hold the Warsaw Pact alliance together with 
the lash of Soviet tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Such a choice "increasingly appears likely" to confront Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
And because the response remains in doubt, the Maine Democrat said that the 
U.S. government must proceed cautiously -- both in defense cuts and in other 
diplomatic actions that may send the wrong signals abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite all the talk that has occurred, there remain 605,000 Soviet troops in 
Eastern Europe -- 375,000 in East Germany," Mitchell said in a speech to the 
Los Angeles World Affairs Council. "The fateful moment has yet to occur with 
respect to Soviet policy in Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said that the West has come to regard Gorbachev "as a mythical 
figure," and the senator credited him with policies that "are historic in 
nature." 
</P>
<P>
"But like all of us, he is human and subject to error and contradiction," 
Mitchell continued. 
</P>
<P>
"He has publicly said on many occasions that the people of Eastern Europe, 
including the East Germans, should have the right to determine for themselves 
their future. He has also publicly said that the people of Eastern Europe, and 
especially East Germany, cannot leave the Warsaw Pact. 
</P>
<P>
"What will happen if, as increasingly appears likely, the East German people 
decide for themselves that their future lies outside the Warsaw Pact?" Mitchell 
asked. "That will be the moment of fateful decision on the political 
transformation of Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's speech concluded a two-day visit to Los Angeles in which the 
two-term senator emphasized his hopes that 1990 will produce epic environmental 
legislation in Congress. His remarks on Eastern Europe came in response to a 
question from his audience about defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
He answered that it is "premature" to try to determine how much to scale back 
militarily until the Administration and Congress undertake a "careful review" 
of security needs. "Once we define those needs, then we can develop the type 
and level of force necessary to defend them." 
</P>
<P>
As for unwarranted diplomatic signals, Mitchell renewed his stinging criticism 
of last weekend's surprise mission to China by the President's National 
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. 
Eagleburger. The timing of the trip could not have been worse symbolism given 
the tumult of Eastern Europe, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
"Just last weekend, the men in the Kremlin watched as the national security 
adviser to the President of the United States stood in Beijing and toasted the 
leaders of the Chinese government, which just six months before sent their 
tanks into Tian An Men Square to murder their own citizens. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Lest we be overwhelmed by the events in Eastern Europe, let none of us forget 
that the largest demonstration peacefully urging freedom in all of human 
history occurred in China in June." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said that the Bush Administration should have considered how the 
Scowcroft mission could be perceived in the Soviet Union.

EUROPE: RIGHTIST PARTY PLANS A WING IN EAST GERMANY TO EXPLOIT NATIONALIST 
FEELINGS IN THE MAY ELECTION.

<P>
The far-right Republicans party of West Germany is exploiting the sensitive 
issue of German reunification in a way that has the centrist parties worried. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans' latest move, under the direction of former SS Sgt. Franz 
Schoenhuber, is the announcement of the formation of an East German wing of the 
party, to put up candidates in the free elections scheduled for May 6. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans say they plan to capitalize on the East Germans' desire for 
reunification of the two Germanys, as shown repeatedly by demonstrations in 
Leipzig and other East German cities. 
</P>
<P>
Political specialists in Bonn and East Berlin say that because the main 
opposition groups in East Germany have not yet organized as political parties, 
the Republicans could have a strong appeal to nationalist feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"We want an active German policy with the aim of reunification," party leader 
Schoenhuber says. "We want free . . . elections for East Germany and then a 
plebiscite on reunification." 
</P>
<P>
The issue could develop political momentum on both sides of the border, the 
analysts say, because the Republicans are exploiting both sides of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
They are calling for reunification and at the same time urging East Germans to 
stay in their country and not join the hundreds of thousands who have fled to 
the West. This position is supported by many West Germans, who fear that the 
newcomers will take needed jobs and housing. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans party could prove to be the natural political home for the new 
arrivals, who might reject the West German opposition Social Democrats because, 
as political analyst Angelika Wolle, has put it, "Socialism has become a dirty 
word for them." 
</P>
<P>
The Christian Democrats as well as the Social Democrats are worried about 
losing votes to the Republicans in next December's elections. The Republicans 
party has its roots in the rural areas of Bavaria, where their values are 
widely shared: patriotism, hard work, family, law and order, tougher 
immigration laws, national assertiveness. 
</P>
<P>
In Bavaria, the Republicans have cut into the right-wing vote that has usually 
gone to the Christian Democrats. In local elections this year, the Republicans 
also showed strength in other parts of West Germany, including northern cities, 
where they made gains among working-class people who had customarily voted for 
Social Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans polled more than 7% nationally in last June's elections for the 
European Parliament. Schoenhuber himself won a seat in the European Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans also worry the liberal Free Democrats, who normally get only 7% 
to 8% of the vote. A minimum of 5% is needed if a party is to be represented in 
the national Parliament, so the Free Democrats cannot afford to have their 
strength eroded. 
</P>
<P>
Many West German political commentators are concerned about the possibility 
that the Republicans will move even further to the right. The party's rallies 
raise disturbing memories of the rise of Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party in the 
1920s. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time," a political specialist remarked the other day, "the news 
media ignored Schoenhuber, but since he started winning elections, the media 
has not only discovered him but turned him into a demon." 
</P>
<P>
Schoenhuber, however, complains that lately the media have ignored the 
Republicans or written them off as right-wing fanatics. 
</P>
<P>
"I say intelligent things," he says, "but the German media doesn't bother to 
put the intelligent things in their stories." 
</P>
<P>
Schoenhuber, 66, is a former television journalist who makes no apology for his 
service with the SS, which began as Hitler's bodyguard but grew to the point 
that it included armored divisions and provided guards for concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
At his rallies, drinking beer and eating sausage, he comes across not as a 
demon but as an affable politician who is on to a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
"Look around," he told a visitor at a recent rally in Furth-im-Wald, in 
Bavaria. "These are the people who work for our party. They are our core. Do 
they look and act like extremists? Like neo-Nazis? 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly we are on the right wing of the political spectrum. But that has 
nothing to do with Nazism or fascism. Hitler brought a great catastrophe for 
our country and the whole world. He was a criminal idiot. But we do say yes to 
patriotism, and no more mea culpas; the time for apologizing is past. I was a 
patriotic young German soldier. I am still patriotic, and that is the appeal of 
the Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
Schoenhuber has been concentrating in the past few months on organization -- he 
wants to create a party structure independent of his own personality -- and has 
been out of the political limelight. He re-emerged with the announcement of the 
party's involvement in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a definite future," he said, "because our members are young -- 70% of 
them 30 or younger. We are the youngest party in Germany, and many of our 
members are civil servants, in the police, the armed forces, government 
offices." 
</P>
<P>
Schoenhuber denies that being on the far right makes him automatically suspect 
as anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
"How could I be?" he said. "My first wife was a Hungarian Jew, and my daughter 
living in the United States is half-Jewish. Racism of any kind is deadly and 
unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
Political observers say the Republicans could look to get the votes of people 
who feel passed over by the economic boom and think their jobs and social 
benefits are jeopardized by the influx of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking," Schoenhuber said, "we are the party of the poorer 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Other political parties embrace the virtues of West Germany's ties with the 
Western Alliance, but the Republicans emphasize "Germany first." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel proud to be German," Schoenhuber said. "We are the only party in favor 
of immediate reunification. I'm convinced that time and events are working for 
us."

The Yugoslav Communist Party published a draft declaration Friday saying that 
it is ready to give up guaranteed power and compete with other parties in 
elections next year. 
</P>
<P>
It also called for a new constitution guaranteeing market-oriented economic 
reform, respect for human rights and an independent judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
"The end to the authoritarian socialism has come," the declaration said. 
</P>
<P>
The document, prepared for a national party congress next month and published 
in the daily paper Borba, appeared to be Yugoslavia's reply to the wave of 
democratic change sweeping Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"The Communist Party of Yugoslavia supports freedom of assembly, speech and all 
other civil liberties, regardless of political convictions of individuals," it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Political "associations, movements or parties will depend on the will of the 
citizens, whose freedom of choice must be guaranteed by the constitution," it 
went on. 
</P>
<P>
It said that the Communist Party will relinquish its power monopoly and 
participate, along with other parties, in "free, direct and secret elections." 
</P>
<P>
"We are changing all of this now in order that tomorrow will not be too late 
for socialism in Yugoslavia," the declaration said. It added that the changes 
should be accomplished within six months after the party congress. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the Communist leadership of Serbia, the country's largest republic, 
was the staunchest opponent of Western-style government in Yugoslavia. But at 
its convention Friday, Serbian Communists appeared to have softened their 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
Communists and Serbian authorities "have no reason or wish to impede 
administratively the establishment of (independent) political parties" in the 
republic, Bogdan Trifunovic, the region's party chief, said in his keynote 
address.

MENEM PICKS AIDE TO FIGHT ARGENTINE INFLATION

<P>
President Carlos Saul Menem on Friday put a trusted aide at the helm of 
Argentina's troubled economy in place of a party outsider who had failed to 
break inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Health and Social Welfare Minister Antonio Erman Gonzalez was named economy 
minister after businessman Nestor Rapanelli resigned the post. 
</P>
<P>
Rapanelli, 60, who was sworn in five months ago to tackle Argentina's worst 
economic crisis, had been criticized for his business background by the 
union-based governing Peronist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, a longtime confidant of Menem, is held in esteem by rank-and-file 
Peronists, and his appointment is an apparent move to defuse political 
opposition to Menem's economic program. 
</P>
<P>
Rapanelli resigned four days after announcing new anti-inflation measures which 
drew strong criticism from business and labor leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The austral currency plummeted 28.3% against the dollar after it was devalued 
by 34.8% Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Economists estimate that prices will rise by more than 20% in December, much 
higher than Rapanelli had targeted. 
</P>
<P>
Rapanelli had brought monthly inflation down to 5.6% from a record of nearly 
200%, but the trend reversed. 
</P>
<P>
Aldo Ducler, an adviser to Rapanelli, told reporters the Cabinet reshuffle 
signaled "the Peronization of the economy." 
</P>
<P>
"The outgoing team's members were the only ones who stood up for economic 
stability, while the Peronist party has remained silent these past five 
months," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Before becoming health and social welfare minister, Gonzalez was the Argentine 
Central Bank's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Eduardo Bauza was named to replace Gonzalez, and another 
strong Peronist, Julio Mera Figueroa, is the new interior minister.

Father Bruce Ritter's network of runaway shelters has made him a hero to 
millions, a beacon of hope on the nation's most troubled streets. 
</P>
<P>
Just a month ago, no less a fan than former President Ronald Reagan dropped by 
Ritter's New York Covenant House shelter to offer his own hard-luck story as an 
inspiration to the youths there. When a temporary Covenant House office opened 
in Hollywood early this year, Los Angeles County supervisors proclaimed "Father 
Bruce Ritter Day." 
</P>
<P>
But this week, Ritter's reputation, as well as his $85-million-a-year 
fund-raising operation, threaten to come crashing down around him. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-year-old male prostitute, who had sought refuge at Covenant House, has 
alleged that Ritter funneled at least $25,000 from the program to lavish cash 
and other gifts on him as well as pay for his apartment while the two were 
engaged in a sexual relationship. The scandal has dominated local television 
news and the front pages of New York tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan Dist. Atty. Robert M. Morgenthau has confirmed that his office is in 
the "earliest stages" of an investigation of Ritter, but declined to comment on 
details. He did, however, make the unusual move of condemning unspecified news 
accounts as being riddled with "numerous inaccuracies." 
</P>
<P>
The New York Post, which broke the scandal, said the probe has included wiring 
the young man with a recording device so that investigators could eavesdrop on 
at least one conversation that he had with the priest last month. 
</P>
<P>
Anne Donahue, the executive director of a 20-bed Covenant House shelter that 
opened last month on Hollywood Boulevard, said in an interview Friday: "There's 
no question in my mind that this will be rapidly cleared up. We all knew the 
risk of working with the kids we work with." 
</P>
<P>
Covenant House had initially hoped to make its Los Angeles debut in a much 
larger facility. However, it was forced to scale back amid friction with other 
youth groups, which had complained that their own operations would fall victim 
to Covenant House's superior public relations and political skills. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Ritter held a tearful news conference to deny the allegations of 
financial and sexual impropriety, and assert that his worst transgression was 
the "almost unforgivable" lapse in judgment he showed in spending two nights 
alone with the troubled young man he sought to rescue from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old prostitute approached Covenant House in New Orleans last 
February, seeking protection from the drug dealers and organized crime figures 
for whom he worked, Covenant House spokesman John Kells said. He was given the 
alias Tim Warner, and sent for protection to New York, where Ritter said he 
recognized someone who needed special help. 
</P>
<P>
Ritter said he took the case himself, because "frankly, I had more experience 
than anyone else." Kells said it was not unusual for Ritter and other Covenant 
House staff members to spend much time, even overnight, with the particularly 
troubled young people who are put in its mentoring program. 
</P>
<P>
"The mentors are encouraged to take the kids home and treat them as their own 
children," Kells said. Other groups, however, have criticized this approach as 
blurring the line between professional and personal involvement. 
</P>
<P>
At the news conference, Ritter produced an independent audit that he said 
proved that Covenant House spent only $9,800 to house, employ and help educate 
Warner, which is lower than its $15,000 average per case. 
</P>
<P>
When the young man began failing to attend Covenant House-financed classes at 
Manhattan College and slipping back into prostitution, Ritter chastised him and 
warned that he could face expulsion from the program. At the news conference, 
Ritter speculated that this might have caused the bitterness that led the young 
man to accuse him of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
However the investigation is ultimately resolved, Ritter told New York Newsday 
columnist Dennis Duggan, "it's something I'll have to live with the rest of my 
life. I will always see that question in the eyes of people. Did he or didn't 
he? I didn't. But I was stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Over more than two decades, Ritter has expanded Covenant House from a one-man 
operation in his East Village apartment to a giant network that claims to 
rescue, shelter and counsel 25,000 young runaways a year in six U.S. and 
Canadian cities and four Central-American countries. Its blue-and-white vans 
are a familiar sight, scouring the seediest areas for young runaways who might 
need help. 
</P>
<P>
Ritter has been deluged by accolades. In his 1984 State of the Union Address, 
Reagan singled Ritter out for special praise. Last month, Ritter, who has often 
been compared with the legendary founder of Boys Town, received the Father 
Flanagan Award for Service to Youth from that Nebraska boys' home. 
</P>
<P>
But he has also gathered his share of detractors, including those who say that 
Covenant House is a monument to Ritter's own ego, and is far less effective 
than programs that operate on a smaller scale. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those complaints resurfaced early this year, when Ritter laid plans for 
a 100-bed shelter in Hollywood. In a struggle with rival youth programs that 
was mediated by City Councilman Michael Woo, Covenant House agreed to start on 
a much smaller scale than it had initially planned. Nonetheless, Donahue said, 
it is sheltering at least 50 young people a night, in its own facility and 
elsewhere, and plans to open other facilities around the city over the next few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Ritter has come up against the most wily of political opponents, and won. 
Proving wrong the adage that you can't fight City Hall, he outbid and 
outmaneuvered New York Mayor Edward I. Koch in a bitter 1987 battle to buy a 
Manhattan building that Koch had wanted to use for jail inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Koch accused Ritter of "dirty pool," but conceded: "I can't win it. . . . It is 
very difficult to enter combat with a priest, especially one suffering from 
cancer." Ritter has undergone treatment for Hodgkin's disease, a lymphoma which 
is now in remission, Covenant House spokesman Kells said. 
</P>
<P>
The current scandal, with its allegations of homosexual behavior by Ritter, 
comes at a particularly bad time for the Catholic Church in New York. Last 
Sunday, in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral, about 4,500 demonstrators 
protested the church's policy on AIDS, saying it was an attack on gays. 
</P>
<P>
Chanting protesters also entered the church and lay down in the aisles, forcing 
Cardinal John J. O'Connor to interrupt his sermon as they were carried out.

CHENEY LABELS AS 'HOGWASH' COMPLAINTS ABOUT HIS DEFENSE BUDGET CUTS STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney angrily dismissed as "hogwash" Friday 
congressional criticism that he is radically cutting the defense budget without 
a strategy. 
</P>
<P>
He said the complaints come from politicians who have "never supported a strong 
national defense" and who are looking to lard the pork barrel with billions of 
dollars in savings from the military budget. 
</P>
<P>
Until Friday, Cheney had been silent before a rising chorus of criticism that 
he has been too slow to respond to a dramatically eased Soviet military threat 
and that he was making critical spending choices without a coherent plan to 
support them. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks raised the volume of what is certain to be a rancorous debate over 
how fast and how deep to cut the Pentagon budget in a period of easing 
superpower tensions. Cheney said he would not be swayed from pursuing defense 
cuts "cautiously and prudently." 
</P>
<P>
In a speech in Washington before a Princeton University student group, Cheney 
excoriated "irresponsible" critics who suggest "there is some kind of big peace 
dividend here to be cashed in and to buy all the goodies everybody on Capitol 
Hill can think about buying." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, in six terms as a Republican congressman from Wyoming, earned a 
reputation for shrewd back-room politics, a blunt tongue and unwavering 
conservatism on national security matters. 
</P>
<P>
"There are those on Capitol Hill who've argued in recent days that there's no 
strategy, we don't have strategy for how we should proceed or how we should 
allocate resources or what kind of defense posture we should have," Cheney 
said. "Hogwash. It's simply not true." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, Cheney submitted to the White House the outlines of his 
Pentagon budget recommendations for the 1991 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached last week, total spending for the year will be 
$292.2 billion, a 2% decline from the current fiscal year. Spending for 
individual programs has not been disclosed, because President Bush has not yet 
agreed to support specific budget numbers. 
</P>
<P>
But Cheney said he would recommend an increase in the most politically 
explosive program within the defense budget -- the Strategic Defense Initiative 
(SDI) or "Star Wars." Pentagon sources said SDI program officials had submitted 
a request for $4.6 billion in Defense Department spending for the program, a 
$1-billion increase over current funding. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers have sharply cut Administration requests for "Star Wars" funding in 
each of the past six years, and congressional leaders indicated this week that 
Congress would not approve any increase in "Star Wars" spending. 
</P>
<P>
But Cheney said after his speech, "I'm a big advocate of SDI . . . I think it's 
probably more important in the future than it's been in the past. 
Unfortunately, Congress has not supported it as aggressively as we would like." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney denied a published report that the Air Force would ground its fleet of 
flying command posts, called the "Looking Glass" aircraft, next year as part of 
budget-cutting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Air Force had proposed to discontinue round-the-clock flights of 
the aircraft in a preliminary budget recommendation, "I don't believe we'll go 
forward with it," Cheney said, noting that the Air Force would use the planes 
"as we have in the past." 
</P>
<P>
The flying command post carries a general of the Strategic Air Command and 
supporting staff to issue battle orders in case of a nuclear war that kills or 
disables the President and other command authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Officials familiar with details of the budget request said Cheney had cut 
deeply into manpower and weapons procurement accounts. Research and development 
funds fared relatively well because of Cheney's strong belief in investing for 
the future, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Cheney insisted that cuts will not be made "willy-nilly" to suit 
the whims "of a few members of Congress who have always had projects they 
wanted to fund. They've never supported a strong national defense, and now they 
are prepared to find ways to cut money out of the defense budget and go spend 
it on domestic programs." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney was responding in particular to comments over the past 10 days from Sen. 
Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), chairmen of the Senate and House 
Armed Services committees. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech a week ago, Aspin charged that Cheney was proposing large Pentagon 
spending cuts with lasting significance without a military strategy reflecting 
a changed world. As a result, Aspin said, Congress will demand even greater 
cuts and reorder Cheney's budget to fund local projects of no military value. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a sound basis for the reductions, the budget is in free-fall," the 
Wisconsin lawmaker said. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn accused Cheney of presenting budget plans that are "misleading and 
out-of-synch" because they don't reflect current intelligence about the 
revolutionary changes sweeping Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"These cuts are not based on a current threat assessment, they're not based on 
up-to-date intelligence. The budget is misleading," Nunn said at a hearing of 
his committee on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn has never been accused of being soft on defense and Aspin almost lost his 
chairmanship for supporting former President Ronald Reagan's defense buildup.

DRUG ATTORNEY SERIOUSLY HURT BY CAR BOMB

A bomb exploded in the car of a locally prominent criminal attorney as he left 
for work Friday, seriously wounding him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Gino P. Negretti, 71, aided by neighbors, narrowly escaped flames that engulfed 
the car moments after the blast in a residential section of Miami, police 
spokesman David Rivero said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's pretty well known as a defense attorney, and a lot of his clients are 
drug defendants," Rivero said. "Obviously, that's one of the angles that will 
be checked." 
</P>
<P>
The attorney started his late-model Cadillac and was making a U-turn in front 
of his home when the bomb exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Negretti was rushed into surgery at Jackson Memorial Hospital, where doctors 
removed shrapnel from his arms and legs, Rivero said. The officer said that 
both of Negretti's arms were broken but none of his vital organs appeared to 
have been hit. He was listed in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
The Puerto Rican-born attorney has been well known in Miami legal circles for 
decades. He has represented several defendants in prominent cases involving the 
city's Cuban-American community. 
</P>
<P>
Negretti defended anti-Castro activist Humberto Lopez Jr., who fled to the 
Dominican Republic while appealing a conviction for illegal possession of 
explosives. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, Negretti was one of the attorneys who represented six men convicted of 
an attempted invasion of part of Haiti in a plan to set up a base for 
anti-Castro actions against Cuba.

'KEYSTONE KOPS' DRUG BUY NEAR WHITE HOUSE MOCKED

<P>
The judge in the trial of a teen-ager accused of selling federal officials 
crack cocaine across the street from the White House called the government 
effort to show how easy it is to buy drugs a "Keystone Kops thing." 
</P>
<P>
First the alleged drug dealer didn't show up to make the sale in Lafayette 
Park, Drug Enforcement Administration special agent Sam Gaye testified. Next 
the undercover officer's body microphone malfunctioned. Then the cameraman 
videotaping the deal missed the action because he was being assaulted by a 
homeless woman. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like a Keystone Kops thing," U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin 
exclaimed Thursday as the government presented evidence against alleged drug 
seller Keith Jackson, 18, whose trial continued Friday. 
</P>
<P>
DEA officials set up the Sept. 1 drug sale to show how easy it is to buy 
illegal drugs, even in the shadow of the White House. President Bush used the 
story of the sale as an illustration during his Sept. 5 nationwide speech about 
the war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is charged with four counts of distributing crack at three locations in 
the nation's capital between April 24 and Sept. 1. If convicted, he faces life 
in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Gaye said his boss asked him Aug. 31 to set up a drug deal near the executive 
mansion. 
</P>
<P>
"He just walked into my office and said: 'Can you make a drug buy around 1600 
Pennsylvania Avenue?' " Gaye testified, adding: "I had 24 hours to buy three 
ounces of crack." 
</P>
<P>
Gaye said the first dealer he set up a meeting with didn't show. Then, a 
meeting was arranged with Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
DEA officials said that their efforts to get Jackson to the park almost failed 
because Jackson didn't know where the White House was.

AGENCY OKS GUIDELINES FOR PRICING OF AUTO INSURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Office of Administrative Law gave its approval Friday to regulations 
issued last week by Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie that strike down 
the use of sex and marital status in setting auto insurance rates. The 
regulations also would curtail insurers' use of neighborhood-based pricing and 
impose a cap pegged to the consumer price index on annual premium rate 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
The approval, which was required before the regulations could become legally 
effective, included an amendment that appears to even further diminish use of 
neighborhood or ZIP code-based pricing. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment submitted by Gillespie could mean a more drastic decrease in auto 
insurance prices for urban drivers, particularly in Los Angeles and San 
Francisco, than had been envisioned when Gillespie issued her regulations Dec. 
5. 
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for California's insurers said Friday that a broad-based 
lawsuit to invalidate the regulations is inevitable. The spokesman, Ed Levy of 
the Assn. of California Insurance Companies, said the insurers simply cannot 
live with a regulation that forces them to lower their prices sharply in urban 
areas without permitting them to recoup these decreases by raising their rates 
sharply in rural and suburban localities. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Stockdale Brewer, director of the Office of Administrative Law, said her 
office had required Gillespie to offer the amendment on the neighborhood-based 
pricing question because public comments had indicated that the original 
wording of the regulation was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
As always with implementation of Proposition 103 -- the insurance initiative 
approved by voters last year -- the matter is highly complicated. 
</P>
<P>
Under the regulations issued by Gillespie last week, insurers are required to 
give the most weight in setting auto insurance prices to three factors 
specifically mentioned by Proposition 103 -- a driver's safety record, the 
number of miles he or she drives annually, and the number of years of driving 
experience, in that order. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the regulations as originally worded, Gillespie also allowed the 
insurers to use 25 "optional" pricing factors, of which nine could be construed 
as substitutes for a driver's home address or ZIP code. At the time, this was 
generally interpreted as allowing the insurers to add up each of the optional 
factors to a total pricing weight that could easily exceed the three factors 
named by Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, if each of the nine substitute factors -- such as a locality's 
population density, its vehicle density, its accident frequency or its 
litigation rates -- were ascribed a 4% rate, the total weight given to those 
factors could amount to 36%, or more than the 25% that might be given to the 
safety-record factor named by Proposition 103. This would have minimized 
downward price adjustments in the urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of the Office of Administrative Law, however, Gillespie amended 
this late Thursday to indicate that a driver's record, miles driven and years 
of experience would have to account for approximately 75% of the price, and all 
the optional factors combined could not exceed approximately 25%. 
</P>
<P>
This, if it goes into effect after the 150-day adjustment period Gillespie has 
set, could mean radically lower prices in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
The cap of about 5% on cost-of-living increases in all other areas that 
Gillespie set last week was not changed by this week's amendments. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie's special attorney for the implementation of Proposition 103, Karl 
Rubinstein, said Friday that he did not think the amendment was really any 
substantial change in what Gillespie had said in her regulations in the first 
place, but both insurer and consumer representatives sharply disagreed with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course this is a major change," said Levy, an official of the industry's 
most important Sacramento lobby. "It makes it clear that territorial ratings 
(neighborhood or ZIP code-based prices) must be subordinated. If there was ever 
any doubt we would have to sue, this removes it." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Rosenfield, author of Proposition 103, agreed with Levy that the 
amendment does subordinate the neighborhood-based prices much more than the 
original wording of the regulations did.

MEXICO PLANS NEW DRIVE ON 'LA MORDIDA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To meet complaints about widespread bribery within Mexico's officialdom, 
Mexican diplomats in Los Angeles said Friday that telephone hot lines have been 
established to handle grievances, particularly those involving bribery. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Nunez Mariel, Mexico's acting consul general in Los Angeles, told 
reporters that the hot lines in Mexico are part of President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari's determined effort to rid the country of la mordida -- the bribes that 
officials insist on to conduct everyday business there. 
</P>
<P>
"Bribery is a common practice all over the world, not just in Mexico," Nunez 
Mariel said. "We're just trying to create a new national campaign against 
corruption." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the hot lines, the government has produced nearly 7 million 
booklets -- entitled "Fair Treatment Is Your Right" -- to explain what to do in 
the event a bribe is sought. The booklets will be available at Mexican 
consulates in the United States, at all ports of entry into Mexico and at 
airports, bus stations and Mexican customs offices. 
</P>
<P>
The program comes at a time when Mexicans, many of whom work illegally in this 
country, are returning home for the holidays, flush with U.S. currency that the 
struggling Mexican economy needs. 
</P>
<P>
Salinas de Gortari is the latest in a succession of Mexican presidents to try 
to combat corruption. His predecessor, Miguel de la Madrid, vowed a "moral 
renovation" campaign against corruption, which resulted in highly publicized 
prosecutions of Jorge Serrano Diaz, a former head of Mexico's oil monopoly, and 
Arthur Durazo Moreno, the former police chief of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
While both men were convicted and sentenced to prison terms, the most common 
form of bribery, la mordida, apparently has continued without hindrance. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican and non-Mexican citizens commonly complain that the country's customs 
officials routinely ask for $5 to $20 to speed inspections at the U.S. border. 
At checkpoints in the interior, officials ranging from Mexican federal highway 
patrol officers to local magistrates reportedly demand bribes for uninterrupted 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
In some instances, Mexican officials acknowledge, radios, expensive clothing, 
jewelry and other valuables are confiscated from Mexicans returning from the 
United States because corrupt officials insist that these people do not have 
proper documents to prove ownership. 
</P>
<P>
"With this campaign, I hope this will now change," Nunez Mariel said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Mexican attorney general's office will staff the telephone hot 
lines, officials said. In Mexico City, the number is 604-12-40. Elsewhere in 
Mexico, the number is 91-800-00-148. 
</P>
<P>
While officials in the Mexican Consulate expressed optimism about the new 
effort, those outside waiting in long, winding lines near Olvera Street to get 
visas laughed openly at the program's prospects. 
</P>

DORSEY'S FIRST VICTORY OVER CARSON EARNS CITY 4-A TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On a night that Dorsey High School fans will remember for many years, the Dons 
won the City 4-A football title by defeating top-ranked and defending-champion 
Carson, 26-15, Friday before a crowd of 4,000 at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey, which lost two of its first three games, avenged an earlier loss to the 
Colts to win the school's first 4-A title. 
</P>
<P>
The win, Dorsey's first against Carson in 10 games, extended the Colts' losing 
streak in title games in odd-numbered years to seven. Carson has not won 
consecutive titles since 1971-72. 
</P>
<P>
The Dons were led by running back Lamont Warren, who rushed for 101 yards in 25 
carries and caught five passes for 110 yards. But it was fullback Larry 
Edmonds' 25-yard touchdown run with 2:13 remaining in the fourth quarter that 
clinched the win. 
</P>
<P>
The title completes a season that the Dorsey team dedicated to the late Kevin 
Copeland, the Dons' wide receiver who died from heart failure during a game 
earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best feeling in the world because Kevin always wanted to beat 
Carson and Banning but didn't in his two years (playing)," said Dorsey 
linebacker Tamecus Peoples. "We did everything this year for him." 
</P>
<P>
A key factor in the game was Dorsey's ability to neutralize Carson's offensive 
attack and quarterback Armin Youngblood, who set a school record this season 
with 30 touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
Against the Dons, Youngblood completed only 7 of 26 attempts for 96 yards. He 
was intercepted four times. 
</P>
<P>
"The coaches had their (Carson) offense broken down to the point where we knew 
every play they were going to run once they lined up," Peoples said. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey co-coach and defensive coordinator Eugene McAdoo said pressuring 
Youngblood was important. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran more two-deep coverages than we did when we played them before," McAdoo 
said "I think we confused him at times tonight. 
</P>
<P>
In a game in which Dorsey never trailed, the Dons drove 66 yards in six plays 
to score on their first possession. The key play being a 43-yard pass reception 
from quarterback Chris Cook to Warren, who capped the drive with a five-yard 
sweep. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey added to its lead in the second quarter when linebacker Dennis Paige 
intercepted a pass by Youngblood and returned it 17 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 12-0, Carson finally scored after a six-play, 48-yard drive that 
featured the skills of Michael Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, who owns every Carson receiving record, caught a deflected pass by 
Youngblood for an 18-yard gain, which set up Youngblood's 1-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey capitalized on another Carson mistake after Colt linebacker Nkosi 
Littleton fumbled on a fake punt attempt on fourth down. The Dons drove 49 
yards in nine plays, with Cook scoring on a four-yard run, and after Warren ran 
in the two-point conversion, Dorsey led, 20-6, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Youngblood completed four of 17 passes for 63 yards and was intercepted three 
times in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, Carson recorded a safety when backup quarterback Ronald 
Peebles, who replaced the injured Cook for two series, fumbled out of the end 
zone after being hit by linebacker Harry Fuamatu. 
</P>
<P>
Carson closed to within five points when Youngblood scored from five yards out 
on the first play of the fourth quarter. However, the Colts never threatened 
again as Dorsey was able to make big plays on offense and defense the rest of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that we had to attack their defense right up the middle because they 
had too much speed," said Dorsey Co-Coach Paul Knox. "We saw things from our 
first game that we thought we'd be able to work on." 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey finished the season with a 10-3 record. Carson was 10-2.

FERNANDO HAPPY AT $2 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: DODGERS, VALENZUELA COMPROMISE WITH ONE-YEAR CONTRACT AT A HIGHER 
SALARY, PLUS INCENTIVES. NOW TEAM CAN THINK ABOUT TRADING FOR AN OUTFIELDER. 
</P>

<P>
Those who couldn't imagine Fernando Valenzuela in anything other than a Dodger 
uniform no longer need try. 
</P>
<P>
Ending a different sort of "Fernandomania" Friday, the Dodgers reached 
agreement with the free agent pitcher on a one-year contract worth a guaranteed 
$2 million. It includes incentives, rare in Dodger contracts, that could push 
the salary to $2.5 million if Valenzuela is healthy enough to pitch the entire 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Hours before Valenzuela's lawyer, Dick Moss, said the pitcher would sign with 
another team and end his 10-year stay with the Dodgers, the parties hammered 
out a compromise. Valenzuela accepted less than his demand of three years at 
$6.5 million but received a higher annual salary than the Dodgers' most recent 
offer of two years at $1.7 million per year. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sacrificing some, but you have to be a little bit romantic about this 
game," said Tony DeMarco, Valenzuela's agent, who demanded at least a raise 
from Valenzuela's $1.85 million salary last season. "Fernando loves the Dodgers 
and wants to stay. And now everybody is happy." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela reportedly settled for the short-term pact because few other teams 
were willing to give him more due to shoulder problems that have caused him to 
go 15-21 over the last two years. Because this contract has no second year, and 
because he wasn't a highly ranked free agent, Valenzuela can return to the free 
agent market again next winter. If proven healthy, he could earn substantially 
more. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers agreed to a last-minute raise in their offer because Valenzuela was 
reportedly prepared to accept a similar deal with another team. The only team 
with a confirmed interest was the Oakland Athletics, although sources say one 
National League team, perhaps Philadelphia, also entered the sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
"We were ready to go elsewhere by the end of the day, but Fernando wanted to 
give the Dodgers one last chance," Moss said. "This is where he wanted to play 
and he felt he owed them the courtesy of that one last meeting. We're all happy 
it worked out." 
</P>
<P>
Moss said he contacted Dodger Vice President Fred Claire in Hawaii Thursday 
night and set up Friday's final session, the first time the parties had 
negotiated in more than a week. Moss and DeMarco met in the offices of Bob 
Walker, a Dodger legal adviser. Dodger owner Peter O'Malley and Claire 
participated via the phone, according to Moss. After a lengthy discussion, an 
agreement was reached around 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"When some people expressed some concern about his shoulder, Fernando decided 
to do just a one-year deal and prove to everyone that he was healthy," Moss 
said. "He is a man of incredible pride." 
</P>
<P>
Said Claire: "We had explored many different options . . . but this made sense 
for everybody. If Fernando enjoys a good year, he will be in a very strong 
position next year. And we have an important pitcher for our ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, maybe now Claire can get some sleep. Claire admitted that the thought 
of losing a former Cy Young Award winner was enough to keep a Dodger official 
awake nights. 
</P>
<P>
"Not a day went by in the last two weeks when I didn't live with the thought 
that I could get a phone call to say that Fernando had signed with another 
team," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela was at his winter home in Mexico and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
His immediate importance to the club is not on the mound, but in trade talks. 
His presence gives the Dodgers six starting pitchers, meaning either coveted 
Ramon Martinez or John Wetteland could be used as bait in a deal for a center 
fielder. Several deals were possible last week at baseball's winter meetings, 
but Claire was reluctant to give up any young arms without knowing he had 
Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
Expect to see such names as Boston's Ellis Burks, Philadelphia's Len Dykstra, 
New York Met Juan Samuel and St. Louis' Vince Coleman or Willie McGee being 
tossed around Dodger offices in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"This certainly gives us added depth at pitching," Claire said. He said that 
during his current Hawaii vacation, "I have talked to about 15 general 
managers, and I'm going to pursue things day by day and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly few thought this one-year settlement would happen with Valenzuela, 
29, who has a career record of 128-103 with a 3.19 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
After last season, bolstered by winning five of his last seven decisions after 
not winning for nearly a year because of his tired shoulder, Valenzuela 
demanded a three-year contract. He had finished the year 10-13 with a 3.43 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers countered with a one-year guaranteed deal worth $1.5 million, with 
a similar option year. Valenzuela promptly declared free agency. 
</P>
<P>
Said DeMarco at the time: "We obviously have a difference of opinion. We just 
want what is fair." 
</P>
<P>
After the Dodgers failed in their bid to sign free agent pitcher Mark Langston, 
they made another pitch for Valenzuela last week, increasing their offer to 
$1.7 million annually for two years. Again, Valenzuela would not listen. 
Sources say he felt the Dodgers were not appreciating his years of service, and 
taking him for granted. 
</P>
<P>
But despite talk of big New York Yankee dollars, Valenzuela soon learned he 
wouldn't get richer anywhere else. And the Dodgers realized although he may not 
have been as important to other teams, he was certainly important to them. Only 
when both parties realized the seriousness of their predicament, and how much 
they needed each other, did they come up with the special deal that DeMarco 
said contained O'Malley's personal stamp. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter O'Malley personally helped with this; I was very impressed," DeMarco 
said. "This has worked out well for everybody."

Dennis Milton's split decision victory over Michael Olajide Dec. 1 at Albany, 
N.Y., was upheld by the New York State Athletic Commission. But Olajide's 
attorney indicated his client will take the matter to court. 
</P>
<P>
"We're reviewing it (the commission ruling), but there's no doubt in our minds 
that we will take appropriate legal action to seek a reversal of the decision 
in the court," attorney Michael DiRaimondo said. 
</P>
<P>
Olajide thought he had stopped Milton late in the final round of the 10-round 
middleweight bout when referee Ken Zimmer pulled him away from the obviously 
hurt Milton. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer said that he had stepped in because he thought the bell had sounded 
ending the fight. Two of the three judges had Milton ahead, and he got a split 
decision.

Bob Shoup, the only coach in the 28 years of Cal Lutheran football, filed an 
official grievance with a school faculty committee on Dec. 7, the same day he 
was notified of his release from coaching duties. 
</P>
<P>
The university issued a public announcement of Shoup's dismissal Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
"It's public knowledge I filed a grievance," said Shoup, who is otherwise 
restricted from commenting under rules of confidentiality governing faculty 
grievances. 
</P>
<P>
The faculty committee that deals with grievances is a standing committee, and 
Jerry Miller, school president, said it "is not an unusual thing" for the 
committee to deal with grievances. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, also bound by confidentiality, declined to speculate on whether the 
committee would make a binding decision or merely a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
He also declined to speculate on when a decision would be reached.

Swimmer Lynne Cox, 33, of Los Alamitos will leave Sunday for South America to 
swim the Beagle Channel from Argentina to Chile, where the water temperature is 
between 38 and 45 degrees, with winds of 25 to 30 knots. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, who swam the Bering Strait from U.S. to Soviet territory in 1987 and a 
part of Lake Baikal in Siberia last year, said: "I think this is going to be

BOWL OFFICIAL MAKES IT OFFICIAL: GOTTFRIED FIRED AS COACH AT PITT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took an official of the John Hancock Bowl to confirm the firing of Mike 
Gottfried as University of Pittsburgh football coach Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we've had a team coming but no coach," said John 
Folmer, chairman of the team selection committee for the bowl, which will match 
No. 23-ranked Pitt against Texas A&amp;M on Dec. 30. "I think a great deal of 
(Gottfried), and I'm disappointed the people of El Paso won't get to meet him. 
But (Pitt officials) told us (the team) will be there, and life goes on." 
</P>
<P>
Although Pitt officials again refused to confirm Gottfried's firing, the coach 
was told Thursday by Athletic Director Ed Bozik that he could either resign and 
accept a buyout on his five-year roll-over contract or be fired. 
</P>
<P>
Gottfried, who did not have a losing record in four seasons with the Panthers 
but had feuded with Bozik over academic matters, refused to quit and abruptly 
ended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Folmer was told that Gottfried would not coach the Panthers 
in the bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Athletic Director Larry Eldridge said a news conference clarifying 
Gottfried's status could be held today or Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Pitt has not said whether any of Gottfried's assistants, including offensive 
coordinator Paul Hackett, would be considered as a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Gottfried's departure came on the same day Pitt announced it would adopt 
academic guidelines stronger than those called for under Proposition 48. Pitt 
will require prospective student-athletes to have a 2.3 grade-point average and 
a minimum 750 Scholastic Aptitude Test score. The NCAA requires a 2.0 average 
and a 700 score.

it agreed to buy working control of Saab's troubled automotive operations for 
$600 million. 
</P>
<P>
Saab-Scania of Sweden, facing mounting losses in its car business and desperate 
to link up with a global car maker in order to remain competitive in the 1990s, 
agreed to turn over working control of its worldwide auto business to GM. 
</P>
<P>
Saab-Scania and GM will establish a 50-50 joint venture to run Saab's auto 
operations, with GM appointing the joint venture's chairman. Saab-Scania's 
other businesses, including its aircraft, defense and truck businesses, will 
remain independent of the joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
GM, which is facing a shortage of car-making capacity in Europe because of the 
booming car market there, said it will quickly begin to build some of its Opel 
cars in Saab's under-utilized Swedish assembly plants. GM's European operations 
may also work with Saab in the future to jointly develop new luxury cars for 
the European market. 
</P>
<P>
But GM officials said Saab's cars will continue to be sold in the United States 
under the Saab nameplate. GM has no plans to distribute any Saab cars through 
its dealerships here. 
</P>
<P>
The Saab-GM deal is just the latest sign of a worldwide consolidation in the 
auto industry, which has prompted a wave of acquisitions of small European 
companies by Detroit's Big Three. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Ford owns Jaguar and Aston Martin, Chrysler has Lamborghini, and GM, in 
addition to its new stake in Saab, owns Lotus. 
</P>
<P>
The Saab agreement apparently came together quickly in the last few days, with 
GM anxious to gain a presence in the European luxury market and Saab officials 
frantic to gain access to a company with deep pockets and a large technological 
base. 
</P>
<P>
"Only by launching far-reaching cooperation on an international basis is it 
possible for Saab-Scania to further develop its operations," Saab-Scania 
President George Karnsund conceded. "Soaring costs for research and development 
and ever-increasing international competition make it difficult for small 
volume makers to survive on their own." So, after being spurned by Ford earlier 
this fall, Saab turned to GM. 
</P>
<P>
GM officials said Saab first approached GM about some form of cooperative 
relationship three months ago, but others knowledgeable about the agreement 
said the deal was hammered out in just the last 10 days, pushed in part by GM 
Chairman Roger Smith's desire to garner some positive news coverage for GM, 
which has been taking a beating in the press for its disastrously declining 
American car sales. 
</P>
<P>
"Roger Smith just wanted some good news," said one observer who was familiar 
with the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
GM spokesman Ronald Theis acknowledged that intensive talks with Saab did not 
begin until GM was thwarted in its bid for Jaguar in November. "Things moved 
fast," Theis said. "Certainly the intensive negotiations started after Ford 
bought Jaguar and Ford stopped talking to Saab." 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts questioned whether GM should have invested in Saab, a company 
with little to offer for the future. Saab has virtually nothing in the pipeline 
in the way of new products for the 1990s, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the company is under strain from the heavy costs of modernizing its 
operations. Saab blames the expense of adding new Swedish factories -- an 
assembly plant in Malmo and an engine facility in Sodertalje -- for the 
$188-million loss suffered by Saab's car operations during the first eight 
months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Saab's aging car lineup -- limited to just the Saab 900 and 9000 
series -- is now losing its luster among young professionals, who had been 
Saab's prime customers in the United States. Through mid-December, Saab has 
sold just over 30,000 cars in the U.S. market in 1989; as recently as 1987, it 
sold nearly 45,000 a year here. 
</P>
<P>
Still, other analysts argued that the $600-million price tag made Saab a 
relatively cheap investment for GM, especially compared to Ford's $2.5-billion 
purchase of Jaguar.

A NEW AGE IN KOSHER FOODS; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: A DECADE AGO, THERE WERE 1,000 KOSHER PRODUCTS, CONSUMED MOSTLY BY 
ORTHODOX JEWS. TODAY, THERE ARE 18,000 PRODUCTS, WITH $30 BILLION IN GROSS 
SALES.

In Craig Winchell's business, security is of the essence. 
</P>
<P>
His Sebastopol, Calif., complex is surrounded by an eight-foot fence that's 
topped with a twist of razor-sharp barbed wire. Employees are carefully 
screened. Specifications are exacting. A team of inspectors could drop in at 
any time. 
</P>
<P>
Winchell is not an engineer with a defense contracting firm, but rather an 
Orthodox Jew who makes premium kosher wines -- Gewurtztraminers, Chardonnays, 
Cabernet Sauvignons. His Gan Eden winery is part of a growing crop of certified 
kosher specialty food makers reaching out to an clientele beyond the nation's 
devout. 
</P>
<P>
The security measures, Winchell says, are to keep "unauthorized people out" of 
his winery. To maintain the strict kosher standards, all workers must be 
observant Jews. 
</P>
<P>
"The kosher market is much smaller than the California wine market in general," 
Winchell says. "In the kosher market, we're dealing with the perception that 
European wines are better than California wines. . . . Luckily, we sell all we 
make to the general market." 
</P>
<P>
Kosher foods were formerly only available in mainstream grocery stores during 
High Holidays, and, even then, consumers were lucky if they found much more 
than a box or two of matzo and some gefilte fish. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, there were 1,000 kosher products, and their consumers were 
generally the same group that made them: Orthodox Jews. Today, about 18,000 
kosher products, from Chardonnay to Cajun-style chicken, Pepperidge Farm baked 
goods to Slim-Fast diet aids, are available year-round. Industry watchers peg 
the kosher market at about $30 billion in gross sales for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Winchell was one of 80 kosher food manufacturers from around the country who 
gathered Friday at the Los Angeles Convention Center for the International 
Jewish Festival '89. 
</P>
<P>
"The growth in kosher foods over the last 10 years has been absolutely 
phenomenal," said Rabbi Menachem Genack, rabbinic administrator for the New 
York-based Orthodox Union, the leading kosher certifier. "The number of 
companies that have come under the OU's supervision has nearly tripled in size 
from about 450 companies to about 1,250 or so." 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers include Hiram Walker, Slim-Fast, the Sioux Honey Assn. and Pepperidge 
Farm; longtime kosher companies include Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes 
everything from kosher cake mixes to kosher laundry and dish detergents. 
</P>
<P>
Kashrut, the Jewish dietary code, is complex and largely based on Old Testament 
teachings. For example, meat and poultry must be raised on natural feed and be 
slaughtered according to Jewish ritual. 
</P>
<P>
Only part of the renewed vigor of the age-old industry is due to Jews who are 
returning to religious orthodoxy, said Menachem Lubinsky, president of Lubicom, 
the New York-based marketing firm that organized the trade show. 
</P>
<P>
Consumption of kosher foods is often associated with America's 4.3 million 
Jews, he said, but market studies show that there are 6 million Americans who 
specifically buy kosher products. 
</P>
<P>
Some are Seventh Day Adventists and Muslims, who adhere to similarly strict 
dietary codes. Others simply "believe that kosher products are healthier and of 
better quality," Lubinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 80 food manufacturers who gathered Friday are the first to admit 
that they're using that perception as a strong marketing point for the general 
consumer. On the West Coast, Season Products Corp. sells most of its fish 
products -- like low-sodium sardines -- in natural food stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Natural food people look at kosher certification for the wholesomeness," says 
Alan M. Kahan, food broker for Season Products. Then there's Bruce Y. Prince, 
executive vice president of Giamboi Kosher Food International, who was in Los 
Angeles Friday pushing his premium Italian food: pricey tomato sauces, pastas 
and extra virgin olive oil. 
</P>
<P>
"We came up with a product that the public would buy that wouldn't be stuck in 
the aisle with the gefilte fish," said Price. "For the first time, you're 
getting a kosher gourmet pasta sauce in a microwaveable bottle. It sells 
itself."

L.A. ECONOMY SEEN 'MUDDLING THROUGH' 1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Mayor Tom Bradley received cautious to downbeat forecasts about the economic 
health of Los Angeles on Friday, along with a prediction that the area's 
population will grow by 3 million in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
The worst news to emerge from the mayor's annual "breakfast summit" on the 
local economy was about the declining aerospace industry and a predicted 
flattening of the home-building industry in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"The best of the economic years are behind us, to be sure," said Mike Salkin, a 
senior vice president of First Interstate Bank. The local economy will "muddle 
through" in 1990, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the motion picture industry and several other areas of the local 
economy are expected to do well and the dramatic population growth will prevent 
a recession in the region, Bradley was told. 
</P>
<P>
The session Friday morning was a gathering of officials of the Los Angeles Area 
Chamber of Commerce, local business people and city officials; it traditionally 
is the first step in the Bradley Administration's financial planning for the 
new year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going to be in good shape in the coming year," Bradley said 
after the meeting. "We're cautious, we're careful, and we manage our finances 
very well." 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit will be the aerospace industry, the largest manufacturing employer 
in the Los Angeles area, according to Chamber of Commerce figures. The industry 
peaked in 1987, but it lost 7,000 jobs this year and is likely to lose another 
5,000 in 1990, said Jack Kyser, the chamber's chief economist. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a hit for our economy, but it's not going to devastate us," 
Kyser said. "The growth rate (for Los Angeles) has slowed down, just like the 
nation, but we are still showing more vigor than the nation as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
Kyser took more of a booster's view of conditions in Southern California than 
do some East Coast analysts, who see cutbacks in defense spending as a serious 
threat to the region and have predicted a crash in the real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not that negative about what's going on in the defense industry," Kyser 
said. "One thing that people seem to overlook is that we have significant 
strength in commercial aircraft production in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Although overall aerospace employment numbers are going down, he said, aircraft 
production and parts manufacturing are increasing. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these analysts are saying, 'You're going to get a kick in the pants 
because your employment is going to drop sharply,' " Kyser said. "We're not 
getting a kick in the pants. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not doom and gloom, but it's much slower growth in this key industry, and 
we've got the potential of losing some subcontractors, some major firms." 
</P>
<P>
The business and financial services sector is continuing to grow, Kyser said, 
but turmoil in the savings and loan industry has caused problems for some 
accounting firms. Law, architecture and engineering firms will be very strong, 
he said, and tourism will see modest growth. He predicted growth in 
international passenger traffic at Los Angeles International Airport but said 
domestic travel will be sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
Next year "is not going to be the best year . . . but it's not going to be the 
worst year," Kyser said. 
</P>
<P>
In the view of First Interstate's Salkin, who heads the real estate division, 
1990 "could be a year in which we muddle through at best." 
</P>
<P>
Residential real estate, a highly cyclic business, is headed for the type of 
downturn that usually occurs at eight-year intervals, Salkin said. The last one 
occurred in the early 1980s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The bad news is that the trough in home-building activity is not behind us; it 
is ahead of us," Salkin said. However, some indicators suggest that the trough 
will not be as deep as in other cycles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are worried about overbuilding, we are worried that land prices have peaked 
and are now coming down. In fact, our good developer clients suggest that 
they're not going to rush to buy land now. They're going to wait three months 
or six months." 
</P>
<P>
Housing prices will flatten out, he said, but no precipitous drops are 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted trouble for builders of office and manufacturing space, however, 
saying there is not nearly enough demand to fill structures already completed. 
</P>
<P>
Vacancy rates in downtown office buildings, he said, will get significantly 
higher in the next five years.

Kodak to Take Big 4th-Quarter Charge: Rochester, N.Y.-based Eastman Kodak Co. 
said it will take a fourth-quarter charge of $273 million, or 85 cents a share, 
for payments to departing employees and other cost-cutting moves. The current 
charge, along with previously announced writeoffs of $227 million against 
second-quarter earnings, will reduce Kodak's operating profit by $500 million 
this year and its net profit by about $1.55 a share, the company said.

AIRLINE SEVERS TIE WITH CBS IN DISPUTE

Because CBS refused to cut stories about air crashes and other airline problems 
from the daily in-flight news shows it provides American Airlines, it is losing 
American's business on Feb. 28, a CBS official said. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, in March, only taped CNN newscasts -- without pictures of airline crash 
stories -- will continue on the airline, thanks to an unusual contract that 
Turner Home Entertainment said it expects to sign next week with American. 
</P>
<P>
American's rationale may be to avoid alarming its passengers, but "it's like 
passing out newspapers with holes cut in them," said David Berman, a vice 
president of CBS Broadcast International. 
</P>
<P>
"The agreement is limited to (stories about) air crashes," said Steve 
Chamberlain, vice president of Turner Home Entertainment, which merchandises 
programs of Cable News Network, part of Ted Turner's cable empire. 
</P>
<P>
"There will not be any other wholesale editing of our product," he adds. "Above 
all, we have to preserve the journalistic integrity of our network." 
</P>
<P>
Although he said air crash stories would be edited from CNN's in-flight news 
packages for American, Mary O'Neill, a spokeswoman for the airline, said 
Thursday that this doesn't mean a complete blackout of such stories. 
</P>
<P>
"What the contract with CNN calls for is that CNN will not show the video," she 
said by phone from American's headquarters in Dallas. "They will talk, in the 
audio portion, about these kinds of incidents. But they will not show the 
video." 
</P>
<P>
She called this an arrangement worked out after American's surveys showed that 
its passengers complained that pictures of airline crash scenes disturbed them 
deeply.

U.S. WHOLESALE PRICES DIP 0.1% IN NOVEMBER; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE THIRD DROP IN FIVE MONTHS FUELS HOPES THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE 
WILL MOVE TO LOWER INTEREST RATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prices of finished goods at the wholesale level fell 0.1% in November, the 
third decline in five months, the Labor Department reported Friday. The report 
provided more evidence that the U.S. economy is slowing dramatically and fueled 
hopes that the Federal Reserve may lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
A sharp 3.3% drop in energy prices, following two consecutive months of higher 
gasoline and fuel oil costs, more than offset a 0.8% upward move in food prices 
last month, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
Excluding food and energy prices, which tend to be more volatile than other 
wholesale goods, the core rate of inflation at the wholesale level was 0.2% in 
November and has averaged 4.2% over the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
November's figures normally would be taken as a welcome sign that wholesale 
inflation has settled down to a manageable level after spurting to an annual 
rate of 9.4% during the first five months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts instead saw the report as yet another sign that the 
goods-producing sector of the American economy has slumped into virtual 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
"On the price side, this is good news. It suggests inflation is coming down a 
little," said Donald Straszheim, an economist with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in 
New York. "But the reason is that the economy is weakening. We are getting the 
bitter with the sweet here." 
</P>
<P>
Straszheim noted that prices of industrial goods, such as primary metals and 
raw cotton, fell by a full percentage point or more in November after declining 
in the previous two months. Overall crude materials, excluding foodstuffs and 
fuels, were down 2.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Although the figures indicate that the rate of inflation for finished goods is 
likely to remain low, they also signal that industrial demand is sluggish and 
production is likely to slump. 
</P>
<P>
As if to underscore that point, the Federal Reserve Board said in a separate 
report Friday that industrial production, which declined 0.6% in October in the 
wake of the Bay Area Quake and the Boeing aircraft strike, increased an anemic 
0.1% in November. 
</P>
<P>
The troubled auto industry continued to decline, with auto and truck assembly 
running at an annual rate of 6.2 million, down 500,000 units for the month. But 
durable goods production rebounded 0.5%, after declines of 1.8% in October and 
0.7% in September. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed also reported that the operating rate of the nation's factories, mines 
and utilities dipped 0.1 percentage point to 82.7% in November, the lowest rate 
since April, 1988. Capacity utilization fell 0.6 point in October and has 
dropped steadily from a 10-year high of 84.3% last December and January. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no inflation out there now," said Donald Ratajczak, a specialist on 
price movements at Georgia State University in Atlanta. "The Fed has been tight 
most of the year and has done a good job knocking down commodity-based 
inflation. Now they should declare victory and back off." 
</P>
<P>
Before adjusting for normal seasonal variations, the producer price index stood 
at 114.8 in November, unchanged from the previous month. That means a 
hypothetical market basket of wholesale finished goods cost $114.80 last month, 
up from $109.80 a year ago and $100 in 1982, the base year.

FEUDING FOUNDERS OF ESPRIT FORCE FIRM'S SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The often bitter feud between the husband and wife team who founded trendy 
apparel maker Esprit de Corp. will force the sale of the San Francisco-based 
company, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The sale, which will be handled by Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., is the second 
stage of a 5-month-old agreement reached between Doug and Susie Tompkins, who 
filed for divorce earlier this year. Under the agreement, Doug Tompkins was 
given 120 days to buy his wife's 50% interest in Esprit. If he failed, the 
bidding would be opened to Susie Tompkins and outside parties. 
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to resolving our ownership deadlock so that Esprit can fully 
achieve its objectives," said Susie Tompkins in a statement. Neither the 
Tompkins nor other Esprit officials were available for further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts speculated that Esprit would draw interest from foreign 
as well as domestic buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not be surprised if there will be more than domestic buyers involved," 
said Scott Killips, a partner in the consulting firm of Booz, Allen &amp; 
Hamilton in San Francisco. "Esprit is well known overseas, especially in Asia 
and the Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
The couple began the firm in the late 1960s by selling Susie Tompkins' designs 
of colorful and loose-fitting clothing through catalogues. Doug Tompkins was 
responsible for marketing and business operations. 
</P>
<P>
By 1987, the couple had built Esprit into an internationally recognized label 
with profits of reportedly $80 million on sales of $1 billion. The fashion 
house also began a costly campaign to open a chain of flashy retail stores 
spread from West Hollywood to Washington. 
</P>

"They made their mark with fashion-forward merchandise tailored to the 
California life style for woman age 12 to 24," said Killips. "They continue to 
do particularly well there." 
</P>
<P>
Esprit was also known for a once colorful corporate life style. Employees could 
sign up for free tennis lessons on the company's grass court and make use of a 
company-owned Lake Tahoe ski cabin. 
</P>
<P>
But in recent years, the Tompkins have been divided on what direction their 
company should take. Susie Tompkins reportedly wanted styles that matured with 
its original customers while her husband has fought to keep the line's youthful 
image. The split reflected the couple's increasingly shaky relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said the couple's conflict over strategy hurt sales and 
profits. As a result, Esprit reduced its staff and perks and began to hire more 
experienced managers from rival apparel firms. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, three new directors joined Esprit's board and the Tompkinses later 
abandoned their operational control of the company.

BANK ART: A SUBSTANTIAL WITHDRAWAL; 
</P>
<P>
MINNEAPOLIS FIRM TO BREAK UP RENOWNED CONTEMPORARY ART COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A major Minneapolis bank that owns one of the most daring and avant-garde 
corporate contemporary art collections in the United States has decided to sell 
off hundreds of its most provocative pieces and dismantle "Controversy 
Corridor," a hallway reserved for especially challenging or disturbing works. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by First Bank System Inc. is to take effect by the end of the 
year. The last reception for Controversy Corridor was scheduled for Friday 
evening, with the hallway of art to be taken down later this month, but the 
bank has not made a public announcement of the closure in Minneapolis, where 
even some art gallery officials were unaware of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
An auction house will be retained to sell off as much as 25% of the bank's 
3,200 pieces of art. Scheduled for the auction block sometime next year, bank 
officials say, are works by such artists as Barbara Kruger, Jonathan Borofsky, 
Joel Peter Witkin, Robert Longo, Thierry Cheverney, Doug Argue, Georg Baselitz, 
Cindy Sherman and Francesco Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Gone will be the heart of a program that once produced, as an official 
publication, something billed as First Bank System's official art "manifesto." 
</P>
<P>
"We are involved with some of the most provocative artists working today," the 
manifesto declared, "because we believe that only through active engagement 
with innovative, critical cultural practices can we progress as an organization 
and a community in the flux of a changing world." 
</P>
<P>
The strategy to liquidate much of the collection is intended, said Chris Mahai, 
First Bank's vice president for corporate relations, to open the way for a 
cultural retrenchment at the bank. Bank employees questioned by The Times said 
management officials have said First Bank's art collection is to be 
characterized from now on by "harmony" and "unity." 
</P>
<P>
The plan to sell off much of the collection follows by several months the 
departure of First Bank's former chief executive officer, Dennis Evans, who was 
displaced when First Bank began to suffer major financial reverses. In recent 
months, First Bank has laid off about 4,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, an avid art collector, originated the program 10 years ago. DeWalt 
Ankeny, the acting chairman who has ordered the dismantling, is not seen as 
likely to take over as CEO. 
</P>
<P>
The bank's refocused collection will be a stark contrast to a corporate art 
program that once hung a series of Andy Warhol silkscreens of Mao Zedong in the 
lobby of bank branches in Milwaukee and Edwina, Minn., and left the exhibit up 
over protests by American Legion posts. 
</P>
<P>
Then the bank commissioned Vince Leo, a Minneapolis photographer, to develop an 
illustrated, spiral-bound book detailing the controversy. The book traced 
parallels between First Bank's history -- particularly its accumulation of 
capital and politically controversial business activities -- and Mao's life. 
</P>
<P>
In all, said Lane Relyea, editor of Artpaper, a monthly publication based in 
Minneapolis, First Bank's program has been one that "does the opposite of what 
you'd think a corporate collection would do." 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is the sense that we want to change the mix of art so it is more 
inviting and comfortable," said First Bank's Mahai. "We are focusing more on 
the consumer market and service side (of the banking industry). There is the 
sense that we want art that is consistent with that image. 
</P>
<P>
"The old art program had a specific mission, which was to broaden people's 
perspective and creative thinking through art. Current management is going to a 
more conservative orientation, and wants the art program to follow that." 
</P>
<P>
"The hallmark of (the earlier) program was a kind of intellectual clarity and a 
sense of a corporation being adventuresome," said Richard Andrews, director of 
the Henry Art Gallery at the University of Washington in Seattle and a national 
authority on public art. "Rather than falling into the kind of normal 
complacency of most corporate art collections, it has really stood out." 
</P>
<P>
Lynne Sowder, curator and director of First Bank's visual arts division, said 
the program began when Evans instituted an aggressive art purchasing campaign. 
In time, art was displayed in every one of First Bank's 125 branches throughout 
the upper Midwest and extensively in the Minneapolis headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most striking elements of the First Bank collection were artworks 
housed in its Controversy Corridor -- a hallway in the bank's headquarters 
accessible to employees and some customers. The corridor was begun as a place 
to which art was taken if it drew overwhelmingly negative reaction after being 
initially hung in employee work areas. 
</P>
<P>
"The bank is dismantling all of this work, categorically," Sowder said. She 
said she will probably leave the bank next year. "There will be nothing left," 
she said. "I think it's a most unfortunate moment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there may be a real failure on the company's part to understand the 
consequences of this act. The bank's problems as a business are undoubtedly not 
unconnected to its difficulty in embracing new ways of thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Controversy Corridor has included work by such artists as Robert Motherwell, 
Bruce Charlesworth and Andy Warhol. Within the last year, it included an image 
by photographer Andres Serrano whose picture of a crucifix immersed in urine 
provoked a storm of controversy in Congress earlier this year. The Serrano work 
on Controversy Corridor was another in his series of urine-related images. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Sowder said, bank officials became concerned about increasing employee 
resentment. Bank workers, Sowder said, complained that they were not given a 
voice in art decisions and were forced to work near art they detested. Sowder 
said vigilante actions like putting plants in front of artworks or knocking 
them askew were common. 
</P>
<P>
"It became clear that people needed a way to free themselves of this 
deeply-bound hostility," Sowder said. To address the problem, Sowder said bank 
art officials began an elaborate communication program, encouraging venting of 
feelings about individual works. 
</P>
<P>
The feedback has continued. One questionnaire response said of the Serrano 
photograph, for instance: "Our staff from senior management to clerical find 
this artwork in poor taste and totally unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, an arts education program was begun, Sowder said, "to try to 
get people to understand the special language of art. What we had never 
addressed was art's symbolic role in this organization." 
</P>
<P>
Employee participation programs like "You Be the Curator" were begun. And some 
employees were involved in decisions on purchases of new art and the 
commissioning of original works. Gradually, Sowder said, bank workers began to 
develop more analytical perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The art collection has apparently performed well by measurements common to 
investment banking. The total purchase price of the collection, bank officials 
said, is about $5 million. The art is currently insured for about $10 million. 
However, the insured values of art collections often understates their actual 
market worth exponentially. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the final decision, reached within the last few weeks, stunned 
many experts. Word of the bank's plan was greeted with disappointment and 
concern at arts centers and corporate art programs across the country, 
officials of which unanimously described First Bank's Division of Visual Arts 
as a model of effective corporate art programs designed to expand the 
intellectual horizons of employees and customers. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers contended that the First Bank move has broader political 
implications and that it may be related to a trend toward imposing more 
conservative values on the arts. Howard Fox, curator of contemporary art at the 
Los Angeles County Art Museum, for instance, said the bank's cultural 
retrenchment may be a product of the same political dynamic that produced this 
year's controversy over the content of work funded by the federal government's 
National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is true that the bank has made this decision, then it may be an 
unfortunate reflection on the climate that has been pumped up with political 
bellows in recent months," said Fox. "That (First Bank) program was legendary 
and well respected." 
</P>
<P>
First Bank's collection "was unique in a corporate setting," said Tressa 
Miller, vice president and director of cultural affairs of Security Pacific 
Corp., which has a huge collection of its own -- more than 12,000 pieces. "We 
were all sort of watching with awe to see what would happen. (The First Bank 
decision) takes from our midst a very aggressive collection that was brought to 
a general public. It's a shame." 
</P>
<P>
Mahai said business reverses suffered by First Bank and a related change in top 
corporate management necessitated the decision. In 1988, the bank reported a 
$507 million loss and is pursuing a fallback strategy in which all of its 
businesses outside a core of consumer banking services focused on the Midwest 
are being abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that they're doing a lot of gruesome restructuring," said Artpaper 
editor Relyea, "and this (plan to refocus the art program) isn't nearly as 
diabolical as some of their other decisions."

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
Bank errors -- There were several factual errors in a Saturday Calendar story 
about the dismantling of the contemporary art collection of First Bank System 
Inc. of Minneapolis: The current acting chairman of the firm is Darrell 
Knudson, who replaced DeWalt Ankeny. Dennis Evans, former president of the 
company, was misidentified as former chief executive officer. The company lost 
$310 million, not $507 million, in 1988. It has eliminated about 500 jobs and 
plans to eliminate a total of 1,700. It has not laid off 4,000 employees. The 
bank's Andy Warhol silkscreens of Mao Tse-tung were hung in its branches in 
Milwaukee and Edina, Minn., not Edwina.

CONSERVATIVES, LIBERALS IN U.S. HAIL RELIGIOUS CHANGES IN SOVIET UNION; 
</P>
<P>
REFORMS: THERE HAS BEEN SURPRISING OPTIMISTIC UNANIMITY ON GORBACHEV'S 
POLICIES. BUT EXPERTS POINT OUT THAT HE STILL HAS A LONG WAY TO GO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Was Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev sincere when he joined hands with Pope 
John Paul II on Dec. 1 and pledged to continue to lead his country down the 
path of religious reform? 
</P>
<P>
And are the religious reforms burgeoning under Gorbachev's policies of glasnost 
and perestroika more than a passing phenomenon? 
</P>
<P>
On both counts, conservative and liberal monitors of religion in the Soviet 
Union are answering "yes," displaying a surprising degree of unanimity on 
questions of politics and religion which, under most circumstances, could be 
expected to spark strong disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
In both camps, Gorbachev and his reforms appear to be scoring high points, even 
though much of the praise is qualified by observations that religious reform in 
the Soviet Union is still in its infancy. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews conducted during the days following Gorbachev's historic meeting 
with the Pope, those sentiments were voiced by representatives of religious 
organizations well known for their staunch opposition to communism, by 
officials of the liberal National Council of Churches and by a rabbi who heads 
an interfaith organization founded to promote religious freedom around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Hill, director of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, a 
Washington-based organization noted for its relentless critique of communism, 
warns that new religious openings in the Soviet Union may overshadow what he 
believes is continued persecution of believers in some quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those misgivings -- and recent events that appear to support them -- 
Hill said in an interview that he believes Gorbachev is sincere in promising to 
continue charting a route to religious reform. He said the Soviet leader 
appears to be calling for reform not simply to curry favor with the West but 
because he really believes it is "not necessary" to cultivate "anti-religious 
attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
The author of "The Puzzle of the Soviet Church" (Multnomah Press), Hill said he 
believes long-promised changes in the Soviet laws on religion will ultimately 
come about. 
</P>
<P>
Those views are shared in large measure by the Rev. Robert Hawley, another 
inveterate critic of communism who heads Open Doors-U.S.A., a 
nondenominational, California-based group that distributes Christian literature 
in restricted countries, including the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev has finally allowed people to express their faith without fear of 
repercussions," said Hawley. "For the first time in communist history, they 
(communist leaders) have acknowledged and recognized the church as a viable 
institution in their society." 
</P>
<P>
The reforms have gone so far already -- and seem to have such support -- that 
it is unlikely there could be any significant rollback, Hawley said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's policies have led to the reopening of hundreds of closed houses of 
worship and unprecedented distribution of religious literature under communist 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the most remarkable turnabouts, Soviet officials in the Ukraine 
announced during the Rome meeting between the Pope and Gorbachev that they 
would begin registering congregations of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, which 
in 1946 was forced to merge with the officially recognized Russian Orthodox 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
Father Leonid Kishkovsky, the newly elected president of the National Council 
of Churches and the first Orthodox Church person to hold that post, said the 
Soviet reforms reflect "a readiness of the society . . . to see the positive 
contributions of religious life for the moral strength of society, and all of 
that is for the good." 
</P>
<P>
Kishkovsky, whose paternal grandfather was an Orthodox priest in what is now 
Poland, characterized Gorbachev's sincerity as a recognition that it "makes 
sense for him to appeal to all the positive forces in his society." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union is so far down the road to reform, Kishkovsky said, that it 
will be "impossible to roll things back to the ideological rigidity" that 
characterized the Soviet approach to religion historically. 
</P>
<P>
Like other observers, Kishkovsky said he anxiously awaits the new law on 
religion that Gorbachev has promised will codify many of the administrative 
reforms already taking place. 
</P>
<P>
Kishkovsky said he saw one of several drafts of the new law during a recent 
Moscow trip. He called the draft a "distinct improvement" over current laws 
which, among other things, limit the ability of parents to provide religious 
education for their children and deter the spreading of religious faith openly. 
</P>
<P>
For Rabbi Arthur Schneier, president of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, an 
interfaith religious rights organization, reforms under way in the Soviet Union 
represent a dream long shared by him and his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, Gorbachev needs allies for the restructuring of Soviet society," he 
said. "Certainly, with the communist ideology falling apart, the religious 
community can be a very important harnessing point for a people who are 
searching for an anchor of faith, . . . a way to cope with all the changes that 
are being introduced." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the possibilities of a "renewed identity" for all believers in the 
Soviet Union, Schneier said, "I'm grateful to God that I lived to see it."

SCHULLER TAPES SERMON FOR SOVIET TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A ministerial visage and voice familiar on American television will soon be 
seen in a guest appearance on "Thoughts of the Eternal," the first ever Soviet 
religious program that is now about two months old. 
</P>
<P>
Back from a brief trip last weekend to Moscow, Pastor Robert H. Schuller of 
Garden Grove said that he taped a sermon for the 15-minute weekly program but 
that he also harbors hopes that his regular "Hour of Power" services televised 
from the Crystal Cathedral will be welcomed someday on Soviet television. 
</P>
<P>
In the Dec. 3 televised service at the Orange County church, Schuller and 
wealthy industrialist Armand Hammer discussed the significance of the Malta 
Summit of President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Hammer, 
long known for his friendship with top Soviet officials, had planned the pulpit 
dialogue in the hope of showing it to Soviet TV officials. 
</P>
<P>
Invited to Moscow by Valentin Lazutkin, deputy chief of the Gostelradio agency, 
Hammer, Schuller and the pastor's wife, Arvella, took the videotape of the Dec. 
3 service with them as a gift for possible use on Soviet television. 
</P>
<P>
Lazutkin said he had no authority to do that, but he instead asked to tape 
Schuller giving a short sermon for the "Thoughts of the Eternal" program, which 
is normally an interview program with Soviet religious leaders. Schuller said 
he spoke on hope, using Jeremiah 29:11 as a text. The program might be shown 
Dec. 24, Schuller said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hammer asked about broadcasting our Christmas Eve services live to the Soviet 
Union, but I don't think that is likely," Schuller said in an interview, citing 
technical difficulties and problems with providing simultaneous translation. 
</P>
<P>
"But we were received with such tremendous affection," he added. "Whether the 
'Hour of Power' is aired or not, I have no doubt that there is a wide open door 
to go back to Russia."

CHRISTMAS/HANUKKAH CARDS ASSAILED AS AFFRONT TO FAITHS

A Jewish group and an interfaith agency have criticized holiday cards that 
combine Christmas and Hanukkah symbols, saying that they are "an affront to 
Judaism, to Christianity and to serious interfaith relations." 
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, the American Jewish Committee and the National Conference 
of Christians and Jews said that "true interreligious relations require respect 
for the integrity of distinct faiths and a repudiation of syncretism. Greeting 
cards that mingle Santas and menorahs, angels, trees, stockings and Stars of 
David, are objectionable. This would also be the case with the symbols of 
Easter and Passover." 
</P>
<P>
Mort Yarmon, director of public relations for the Committee, provided samples 
of cards that show an angel lighting a menorah, a menorah atop a Christmas tree 
and a bearded Jew holding a menorah next to Santa Claus with a caption that 
reads, "Happy Whatever." 
</P>
<P>
In their statement, the two groups appealed to the publishers of such cards to 
"refrain from future editions" and urged the public to "reject unequivocably 
anything that blurs the distinctions between our unique and cherished religious 
holidays."

Boxing, if you can call it that after the Roberto Duran-"Surgery" Ray Leonard 
meeting in Las Vegas, has pushed professional wrestling into second place as a 
spectacle. It now is featuring ancient retired ex-boxing rivals pumped up like 
giant Macy parade balloons for the biggest public ripoff in sports. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't a sport that it once was but has become Grade C entertainment with 
pre-fight dialogue like warmed-over toast. 
</P>
<P>
What a gullible public. 
</P>
<P>
There are two suggestions to cure the ills of the "fight" game: 
</P>
<P>
1. Have a giant, legal lottery, since these fights are held in either Las Vegas 
or Atlantic City. A numbered ticket is issued to everyone who pays an admission 
for the live performance or for the poor souls who purchase the high-price 
video coverage, so-called "live." A drawing is held at the beginning of the 
first round. The person with the winning number gets half the gate gross. The 
loser of the fight gets, say, 2% over expenses. 
</P>
<P>
2. If that won't do, then I want to be the promoter of the next 
multimillion-dollar bout to be staged at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium or the 
Coliseum in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
I propose to have as the two heavyweights in the ring, George Burns and Bob 
Hope. It would put the whole boxing mess in correct perspective.

 It is widely accepted that former NBA center George Mikan is credited with the 
widening of the "key" area on a basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
Well, after viewing the "no mas" boxing farce between Roberto Duran and Sugar 
Ray Leonard, Sugar Ray could very well be the boxer responsible for the 
shortening of the dimensions of a boxing ring. If I want to watch people dance, 
I'll rent "Saturday Night Fever." Give me Golden Gloves or Olympic boxing any

TONY EASON RELUCTANTLY ASSUMES ROLE AS JETS' STARTING QUARTERBACK

Tony Eason, the former New England Patriots quarterback who at first refused to 
sign with the New York Jets six weeks ago because of his close friendship with 
Ken O'Brien, the Jets' No. 1 quarterback, reacted with reluctance Friday when 
it became obvious that he would start against the Los Angeles Rams Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're leaning to Eason right now," a seemingly dispirited Coach Joe Walton 
said as he walked toward the practice field. "They (O'Brien and backup Pat 
Ryan) will probably both be ready Sunday, but they haven't had a lot of work 
and they're banged up a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Eason didn't come right out and say he didn't want to start, but he wasn't 
exactly thrilled by the prospect of his first start as a Jet. He acted like 
someone who had more to lose than gain. He refused to say it might affect his 
future, but it appears he doesn't want to look bad in case the Jets make a 
coaching change. 
</P>
<P>
"I have mixed feelings," Eason said. "Our best chance of winning is if Kenny 
plays, or Pat. Everybody realizes that it's just a tough situation. It's 
different in this league. It's not like baseball; you don't come in and take 
your at-bats, and that's it. People just take it for granted, but you got to 
know your plays, and if you have to think about your offense, it takes away 
from what you have to do." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Eason feels he should be so familiar with the Jets' offense and 
the defense they're facing, that he doesn't have to think twice about things 
that come naturally to seasoned quarterbacks. But it appears he'll be thrown 
into the fray. 
</P>
<P>
Walton uncharacteristically brushed by the media as they waited for him. When 
told that Eason appeared reluctant to play, he said, "He knows enough of the 
offense. He hasn't had a lot of work and a lot of repetitions, but he's 
concentrating on a specific game plan." 
</P>
<P>
"As for my playing," Eason said, "my main goal is to get the play called in the 
huddle. That's not a good way to start things off." 
</P>
<P>
Eason last played against the Rams during the Patriots' 1985 Super Bowl season. 
He threw a "Hail Mary" pass that was caught by Irving Fryar for the winning 
touchdown. "I can still see Stanley Morgan jumping eight feet in the air, at 
least it seems like that, and tipping that ball to Fryar," Eason said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ryan, who left practice Thursday after experiencing headaches 
related to his sixth concussion in 12 seasons as a Jet, was upgraded to 
probable. He said he felt fine and could play if needed. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jets owner Leon Hess and team president Steve Gutman were expected to meet with 
Patriots director of player development Dick Steinberg this weekend regarding 
the Jets' general manager position. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what it's like to play when changes appear inevitable, Pat Ryan said, 
"Nobody knows what's going to happen. I have the same idea that everybody else 
has: wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Al Toon, according to Walton, should start Sunday. Toon practiced 
at full speed Friday after being upgraded from questionable to probable. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Mike Haight (neck) was downgraded from questionable to doubtful, and will 
be replaced by Dave Cadigan or Adam Schreiber.

NFLPA DOESN'T DESERVE THE UNION LABEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now the National Football League Players Association has reversed its field, 
running off in a different direction and deliberately throwing itself for an 
embarrassing loss. This is what happens when you play at the high-stakes game 
of labor relations. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders, executive director Gene Upshaw and aide Doug Allen, insist they 
are not involved in a union per se, which is what a certain sportswriter has 
been trying to tell them ad infinitum for well over two decades. 
</P>
<P>
They never had a union concept because they didn't have a wage scale 
commensurate with on-the-job experience nor did they respect the picket lines 
of bona fide unions in other lines of work when they were on strike. The 
players wanted the best of all worlds. 
</P>
<P>
In a shift to a new formation, Upshaw and Allen are asking they not be referred 
to as a union but as an association. It sounds as a play of semantics, but the 
idea is to trap the NFL into another court case. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, more litigation. The players give the impression they don't know what 
they're doing, after taking a beating in the courts, and are grasping for any 
option that not only will save face but also save a more substantial part of 
their association anatomy. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Gatewood, a former Notre Dame All-American and an erstwhile No. 1 draft 
choice of the New York Giants, is interested in starting a rival organization. 
You have to wonder what such former officials of the players association as Tom 
Condon and Ed Garvey are thinking when they view the scuttling of the structure 
they worked so hard to build. 
</P>
<P>
It's said that those still paying dues constitute only 20 percent of the 
membership. If the decertification is formalized, then the move threatens such 
existing benefits as medical insurance, severance pay and income from the sale 
of football-related merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
After a meeting last week in Dallas, Upshaw said, "We are no longer the 
bargaining agent of these players. If (management wants) it settled, they can 
now settle it in court. Right now, this is the only way to settle it." 
</P>
<P>
This means the players are back to where they were before the association 
started -- every individual operating on his own. It may lead to a player 
contesting the legality of the college draft and other functions of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
If this happens, then expansion talk will be silenced again. Without a 
collective bargaining agreement it seems doubtful if progress toward expansion 
can be made. Meanwhile, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, off to an impressive 
start, is carrying his own message to the players. 
</P>
<P>
He has met with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Philadelphia 
Eagles and New York Giants. Tagliabue has appeared before them, as something of 
a lone ranger, without other lawyers or league assistants. The idea is to 
answer their questions and endeavor to create a feeling of trust and 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
One player, center Randy Grimes of the Buccaneers, is so concerned he sent a 
letter addressed "to all NFL players." He went on to say, "No matter who is 
right or wrong, we, the players, have been hurt the most." 
</P>
<P>
Grimes claims the owners offered an improved package in the negotiations and he 
reads this as the chance to get on with a desired bargaining agreement. "It's 
time for us, the players, to take charge of the game we play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of an expression does not increase confidence in the players 
association. Right now, those atop the NFLPA have slashed their own wrists 
(breaking what they erroneously called a union) and contemplate throwing 
themselves on the mercy of the courts. 
</P>
<P>
It has evolved into something of a labor-management chess game that serves no 
purpose because the reality of the situation portends there will always be some 
kind of an association, even if they suddenly have turned against the union 
label.

GLENDALE UNABLE TO STEM ROLLING HILLS TIDE, 63-49

<P>
Despite three starting players shorter than 5-foot-11, Glendale High was able 
to neutralize Rolling Hills' high-powered offense for a quarter Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Then Rolling Hills began to do just that -- roll. 
</P>
<P>
The taller Titans recovered from their slow start and knocked off Glendale, 
63-49, in a championship semifinal game of the Beverly Hills tournament. 
</P>
<P>
After being outscored, 12-8, in the first quarter, Rolling Hills (5-2) exploded 
for 28 second-quarter points -- while limiting the Dynamiters (5-4) to seven -- 
to put the game out of reach early. 
</P>
<P>
"The game got out of our tempo in the second period, and when they made a few 
shots we started rushing," Glendale Coach Bob Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
Dex Puno led Glendale with 17 points. Center Jason Harper contributed 12 and 
Ronny Apcar added 10. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale will meet Buena, a 97-79 loser to Beverly Hills, in the third-place 
game at 7 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Rio Mesa 69, Santa Maria 62 -- In a consolation semifinal, forward Eric Thomas 
scored a career-high 36 points, grabbed 14 rebounds and blocked three shots for 
the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
Palisades 49, Saugus 35 -- Forward Aaron Volpe scored 13 points to pace Saugus 
(2-5), which limited Palisades to seven points in the fourth quarter but was 
never able to trim the second-half deficit to less than 10 points.

Grant High fires so many weapons in the gym that it doesn't seem to matter if 
some of them miss the target. 
</P>
<P>
Take Friday night's 76-66 victory over Reseda (1-4) in a championship semifinal 
of the North Hollywood tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward and floor general Setro Terzian made only two of 13 shots from 
the field and missed his first seven. Terzian finished with five points -- none 
in the second half -- and was called for a charge early in the fourth quarter 
while throwing up an off-balance layup. 
</P>
<P>
"The shot felt good," Terzian said simply. "I had to keep shooting." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Grant (6-0), however, the shooting of guard Rene Delahoya, who 
scored a game-high 23 points, and center Brunell Mori (16 points) felt better. 
Grant plays North Hollywood tonight in the final. 
</P>
<P>
In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood 55, El Camino Real 45 -- The Huskies (9-0) rallied for the 
second time in three games to earn a date with Grant. Senior center Dana Jones 
scored 11 of his game-high 21 points in the second half as North Hollywood 
erased a 32-19 halftime deficit. North Hollywood rallied from a 13-point 
fourth-quarter deficit on Tuesday against Dorsey in a 56-54 win. 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth 52, Poly 41 -- In a consolation semifinal, three Chancellors scored 
in double figures to offset a game-high 21-point performance by Poly's Jason 
Wilson and hand the Parrots their eighth consecutive loss. Eric Isaac (12 
points), Darryl Porter (13) and Craig Hewitt (13) led Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills 93, Bell-Jeff 63 -- Highlander Sag'y Koren came off the bench to 
score a game-high 18 points, and teammates Osiris Nalls and Jermoine Brantley 
added 16 and 15 points.

AMERICAN, UNITED WIN LAWSUIT OVER RESERVATION SYSTEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A U.S. District Court jury in Los Angeles ruled Friday that American Airlines 
and United Airlines had not unfairly exercised monopoly power in the use of 
their computerized reservation systems. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 days of deliberations and a lengthy trial, the jury voted 10-2 not to 
hold the two giant carriers liable. 
</P>
<P>
About 85% of all airline bookings in the United States are made by computerized 
reservations systems, and several airlines asserted in a suit filed in 1984 
that American and United gained dominant positions in the market after the 
computerized systems became technologically feasible in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiff airlines alleged that American and United, whose systems account 
for about 75% of the nation's computerized ticketing revenue, illegally abused 
their domination of the market by charging exorbitant fees and by imposing 
restrictions on travel agents who use their booking systems, making it 
difficult or impossible for agents to switch to rival systems. 
</P>
<P>
Of the original plaintiffs, USAir and Republic settled out of court, but four 
other airlines -- Northwest, Muse (which has since been merged into Southwest 
Airlines), Alaska and Midway, went to trial, seeking $149 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
American and United contended that their fees and contract requirements were 
fair compensation for the millions of dollars they have invested in the 
intricate nationwide databases that search through thousands of airline flights 
and print out an airline ticket instantly in any travel agent's office. 
American officials have said they have more than $400 million invested in their 
Sabre system. 
</P>
<P>
The jury's verdict "is a victory for the free enterprise system," said Robert 
E. Cooper, of the Los Angeles law firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, who 
represented American. "Our clients developed something that others didn't. We 
were first, and we were successful. What we had here was a case of sour 
grapes." 
</P>
<P>
American Chairman Robert L. Crandall said, "After five years of this litigation 
ordeal, including depositions of almost 300 individuals and production of 
hundreds of thousands of documents, American obviously feels vindicated and 
gratified by the jury's decision." 
</P>
<P>
Edward Hoenicke, United's general counsel, said his company also felt that its 
position on the pricing and fairness of its Apollo reservation system had been 
vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
The chief lawyer for the plaintiffs said he was disturbed by the verdict and 
indicated that his clients would appeal. "We're predictably disappointed, 
particularly after the jury was out 10 days," said Maxwell M. Blecher, of Los 
Angeles' Blecher &amp; Collins, who represented the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
Blecher said it was "likely" that his clients would appeal the jury verdict.

Lamb &amp; Lion Records -- A story Friday about the emergence from Chapter 11 
bankruptcy by Lamb &amp; Lion Records, a Christian record company in Burbank 
owned by entertainer Pat Boone, was mistakenly cut and as a result omitted 
important details of the terms of the agreement with its creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, Lamb &amp; Lion has made a $30,000 payment on 
the loan and will make additional monthly payments of $2,500 for nearly two 
years. The balance of the loan is to be paid after that period, according to 
court papers, and Boone is personally guaranteeing the loan. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the agreement, a lawsuit filed in late 1987 in San Mateo County 
Superior Court by Bell Savings &amp; Loan that accused Boone of fraud has now 
been dropped. Boone has denied the allegation, contending that he had been a 
good customer in making payments to Bell and was treated unfairly.

FERGUSON CRYING FOUL OVER GOP MANEUVERS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: NEWPORT BEACH ASSEMBLYMAN SAYS TIMING OF CAMPBELL RESIGNATION WAS 
RIGGED TO KEEP HIM OUT OF RACE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson charged Friday that some of his fellow Republican 
legislators conspired to eliminate him from the race for state Sen. William 
Campbell's seat so they could clear the field for his opponent, Assemblyman 
Frank Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) said he believes that Campbell resigned on Friday -- 
a few weeks before he had originally scheduled his departure -- because it 
could trigger election laws that prevent him from entering the race. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson recently moved into Campbell's Senate district so he could run for the 
seat. If Gov. George Deukmejian calls for the special election before 
Wednesday, Ferguson said, he might not meet the residency requirement to become 
a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's outrageous that someone would scheme such a Machiavellian plan to 
ensure that I was not allowed to run in this race," Ferguson charged Friday. 
"It's obviously no accident that this whole thing was set up. It's well thought 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said he wasn't accusing the Legislature's Republican leaders of 
planning the conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
But he noted that Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson (R-Fullerton) and 
Senate Minority leader Ken Maddy (R-Fresno) have both endorsed his opponent, 
Hill (R-Whittier). 
</P>
<P>
"There are four people who are involved: Frank Hill, Ross Johnson, Ken Maddy 
and Bill Campbell," Ferguson said. "I'm not accusing them, but they're the only 
ones who have any interest in this race politically." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell refused to comment Friday and Hill did not return telephone calls to 
his office. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson angrily rejected Ferguson's charge, saying, "That's just 
categorically incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that any such conspiracy to deny Gil Ferguson the right to run 
for office exists or has existed. Certainly I have not been party of any such 
conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said he talked with Deukmejian's office Friday about his concern and 
was told "the governor does not want to do anything that would exclude me from 
the race." Ferguson said Deukmejian could delay the special election long 
enough for him to qualify, but he was afraid the governor might unwittingly 
schedule it too early. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Deukmejian said the governor has not decided when to schedule 
the special election, which could involve a primary as early as February. He 
said, however, that the governor was not seeking to exclude Ferguson from the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, the governor is not interested in excluding anyone from running in 
the special election," Deukmejian spokesman Tom Beerman said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Campbell submitted a terse letter of resignation to Senate President 
Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), saying he would step down from the 
31st District office effective at midnight. Beerman said Campbell also met 
Friday with the governor. 
</P>
<P>
In a press release Friday, Campbell said he decided to resign after the last of 
his legislative projects -- attending a committee meeting Thursday on the 
subject of investments by the public employee retirement systems. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan to use the last two weeks of this year to make the transition from more 
than two decades of public service to my new career as president of the 
California Manufacturers Assn.," Campbell said in the release. "Although that 
position does not take effect until Jan. 1, 1990, I felt that the transition 
should be accomplished at personal rather than public expense." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell announced in October that he would leave his office in early January 
to become president of the manufacturers association, a major trade group with 
extensive lobbying operations in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Days later, Ferguson announced he would run for the seat. His Assembly district 
overlaps Campbell's Senate district, but Ferguson has lived for several years 
in Corona del Mar, outside the Senate district. Last month, Ferguson said he 
moved to Laguna Beach and registered as a voter in the Senate district as of 
Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's 31st Senate District straddles the line between Orange and Los 
Angeles counties, stretching up to Whittier and south to Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Hill and Ferguson, Brea City Councilman Ron Isles is the only 
other Republican who has announced plans to run for the Republican-dominated 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
State officials also said Friday that the timing of Campbell's resignation 
guarantees that the 20-year legislative veteran will receive an immediate 
cost-of-living increase when he begins collecting his pension. 
</P>
<P>
By quitting before Dec. 31, Campbell will receive the increase scheduled to go 
into effect in January; had he delayed his resignation until after the first of 
the year, he would have had to wait until January, 1991, to receive a 
cost-of-living increase on his base pension salary of nearly $27,000. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's decision to linger in office after his announcement in late October 
angered California Common Cause, which criticized him for having a "serious 
conflict of interest" by not resigning immediately after accepting a private 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
The public interest group lambasted Campbell again last week for taking a 
"junket" in leading a handful of legislative colleagues to New York City to 
meet with investment bankers. The Times disclosed that Campbell, as chief of a 
joint legislative budget committee, also scheduled -- as part of the group's 
official duties -- a tour of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and that the 
legislative contingent accepted dinners and free Broadway play tickets from 
corporate executives. 
</P>
<P>
Air fare and lodging for Campbell and four other state senators will be paid by 
taxpayers, Senate staffers said. 
</P>
<P>
In another matter, a spokeswoman for the federal Small Business Administration 
said Friday that Campbell has failed to comply so far with the agency's request 
that he reimburse the government $60,175 in grants that were made to his 1987 
Conference for Women. 
</P>
<P>
The agency asked for the money back after newspaper articles showed that the 
conference, promoted by Campbell's office, paid $165,000 in consultant fees to 
a firm owned by Campbell's wife, Margene, and a former aide, Karen L. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Conference on Women was held last April (1987), it was widely 
reported that certain individuals, including your wife and a former member of 
your staff, made large profits from the conference," said an SBA letter 
addressed to Campbell in March. 
</P>
<P>
"If that is true, SBA should be reimbursed for the assistance it provided to 
the Conference. Simply stated, taxpayer funds cannot and should not be used to 
support a training event that generates profits for the event's organizers."

CRANSTON WILL TRY TO PROTECT LAGUNA CANYON

Sen. Alan Cranston raised the hopes of environmentalists Friday by pledging to 
try to protect Laguna Canyon, but found himself lambasted hours later for 
shattering the hopes of investors who lost money in the collapse of 
Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
As he wrapped up a campaign-style tour in the home county of Lincoln, Cranston 
found himself toe to toe with Shirley Lampel, a 58-year-old Tustin woman who 
became prominent after telling a congressional hearing that she blamed Cranston 
for the loss of her $30,000 investment when the thrift was seized. Lampel 
interrupted a forum on women's issues to shout at the senator from the front 
row of a high school auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
It was the only event in a daylong tour of Orange County interrupted by 
protests surrounding the Lincoln scandal, which involves questions about 
Cranston and four other senators intervening in federal investigations of the 
thrift's actions. 
</P>
<P>
But it underscored the task facing Cranston, who is trying to repair the 
political damage caused by the scandal. Since Thanksgiving, the Democratic 
senator has been touring the state and meeting daily with reporters in his 
first major public relations effort since the scandal erupted. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday, Cranston rejected a charge that he was one of two 
senators "more culpable" in the scandal than the others. And he defended his 
actions on behalf of Charles H. Keating Jr., who ran Lincoln's parent company, 
which contributed $850,000 mostly to Democratic voter registration projects at 
Cranston's direction. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's visit to Orange County Friday also included a discussion with 
elementary school students on homelessness; a private meeting with California 
exporting executives as well as the tour of a proposed development in Laguna 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston's forum on women's issues before about 40 people in the auditorium of 
Century High School was opened by a small group of conservative Republican 
youths who threw bogus $100 bills at the stage shouting, "Have some more money 
senator, that's the only way you listen." 
</P>
<P>
The forum was then interrupted by Lampel, who complained, "How long am I going 
to have to hold my hand up here. This is the only way I can get a hold of you." 
</P>
<P>
Lampel complained about Cranston's relationship with Keating, insisting that it 
was wrong for the senator to intervene on his behalf with federal regulators 
and charging that it was done in return for contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"Keating said he believes he bought influence. What do you think he bought?" 
Lampel yelled at Cranston, who appeared to remain calm during the 
interruptions. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Cranston met privately with Lampel for almost 10 minutes. The woman 
then hurried away, saying only that she was "very, very, very pleased" with the 
senator's response. 
</P>
<P>
In Laguna Canyon, Cranston was driven through the site of a controversial 
3,200-home construction project proposed by the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said he would explore the possibility of using federal money to buy 
open space in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to explore the possibility of getting federal money but I can't 
hold out any promises," Cranston said. "We have a terrible deficit and there is 
competition from all over the country for money for the homeless, health care, 
fighting drugs. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
On his arrival in Laguna Beach, a dozen environmentalists presented him with a 
T-shirt, flowers and newspaper clippings about opposition to the project. 
</P>
<P>
Some project opponents had pinned their hopes on the Cranston visit, which came 
only a few days after the city of Irvine rejected a proposal to place the 
development in their city instead of the canyon. That move scuttled what had 
been briefly heralded as a major breakthrough in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach officials had originally hoped that moving the development to 
Irvine would be an acceptable solution to all parties. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Laurel project has fostered a decade-long dispute between the Irvine 
Co. and environmentalists who charge it would damage the environmentally 
sensitive canyon. Besides homes, it would include a shopping center, a golf 
course and a school as part of the self-contained community. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach is seeking Cranston's help to purchase about 2,150 acres from the 
Irvine Co. and effectively block development in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
City officials who accompanied Cranston and Irvine Co. executives on the Friday 
tour through scrub and rough terrain were optimistic about the senator's visit. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was interested in examining what federal resources that are out 
there," said Laguna Beach Councilman Robert F. Gentry. "If we accomplished 
that, that's a major accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston was the author of a bill in 1980 that would have preserved the 
southern section of the 2,150-acre Laguna Laurel project zone as open space. 
The bill, which died in committee, would not have affected the 400 acres where 
the homes are proposed. Ironically, Cranston toured the areas that the Irvine 
Co. already plans to designate as open space. He did not see the site where the 
homes would be located because he was running late for another engagement. 
</P>
<P>
Neither officials from the city of Irvine nor the County of Orange attended the 
Friday tour. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley said he had been advised not to 
attend because of the possibility of litigation. Irvine city officials said 
they had prior commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. officials say they will continue on with current plans for the 
project.

Sen. Alan Cranston, continuing his counterattack Friday on the adverse 
publicity linking him to the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan scandal, rejected a 
charge that he was one of two senators "more culpable" than others for their 
roles in the collapse of the Irvine thrift. 
</P>
<P>
The California Democrat said he found nothing wrong in seeking $850,000 from 
Lincoln's parent company, American Continental Corp., despite knowing in April, 
1987, that regulators were asking federal authorities to investigate possible 
criminal wrongdoing by the company's chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr. and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Cranston said, he should have taken more seriously the intent of 
federal regulators to pursue a criminal investigation of Lincoln's operators. 
</P>
<P>
The senator also said he was advocating at the time that regulators come to a 
decision and end their long audit of Lincoln by taking action against the 
S&amp;L or leaving it alone. Such a call for action, he said, should put to 
rest continued claims by others that his intervention delayed the eventual 
government takeover of Lincoln for two years, thereby doubling the eventual 
cost to repair the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators eventually seized Lincoln on April 14, a day after Phoenix-based 
American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection. The S&amp;L may become 
the biggest thrift bailout, costing taxpayers up to $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
That bill doesn't include the massive losses of American Continental 
bondholders, which include about 22,000 people who bought nearly $200 million 
in debt securities at Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches. About 
two-thirds of those bondholders are over 65 years old and many mistakenly 
thought that what they were buying was federally insured. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, in a press briefing before he spoke in Santa Ana on women's rights, 
defended his actions since April, 1987, when he and four other senators met 
with regulators twice over an unusually long financial audit of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, apparently for the first time, he responded to a recent claim by 
Edwin J. Gray, who until June 30, 1987, was chairman of the Federal Home Loan 
Bank Board, which regulated thrifts. Gray had singled out Cranston and Dennis 
DeConcini (D-Ariz.) for heavier blame in the Lincoln fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston and three senators met with Gray on April 2, 1987, to find out why the 
examination of Lincoln had lasted more than a year. At Gray's suggestion, the 
senators, along with Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), met a week later with 
regulatory executives. 
</P>
<P>
Gray has claimed that in the first meeting with him, the senators tried to make 
a deal for Keating, a charge all four vehemently deny. The second meeting ended 
abruptly when regulators said they would ask the Justice Department to 
investigate criminal charges against Lincoln's operators. 
</P>
<P>
Asked three weeks ago who was "more culpable than others" in the meetings, Gray 
quickly identified Cranston and DeConcini. Gray singled out the Arizona senator 
for allegedly pursuing the deal and continuing to deny it. 
</P>
<P>
"And Senator Cranston," Gray said, "who after those meetings, went back to 
Phoenix and he got $850,000 for some phony voter registration groups to help 
him with his election. . . ." Gray claimed that Cranston should have steered 
clear of Keating once he learned that criminal charges were being sought by 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
But, Cranston said, that fact "made it seem more urgent" for regulators to take 
action on their audit. He pointed out that even Gray has said that Cranston's 
only statement in the first meeting related to efforts to get the regulators to 
decide on Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said that federal agencies frequently ask the Justice Department to 
look into possible criminal conduct and that many times the charges are 
unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not take it that seriously," he said about the regulators' intent to 
pursue a criminal probe of Keating and others. "Perhaps, in retrospect, I 
should have. Given the developments that have occurred, he may well have been 
violating laws and, if so, they should throw the book at him." 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said he knew nothing about the bond sales at Lincoln branches, and he 
termed the losses of bondholders "tragic."

SANTA VISITS CHILDREN AT TOGETHER CENTER

His cotton-candy beard was an obvious fake. But the delighted children who 
attended Thursday's Christmas party at the Orange Children and Parents Together 
center didn't care a whit about the quality of Santa's whiskers as they 
clambered, one by one, into his overstuffed lap to whisper Christmas wishes in 
his ear. 
</P>
<P>
Visits from Santa have become an annual affair for the 3- to 5-year old 
children in the center's Head Start Program, thanks to the year-round efforts 
of the members of the Itty Bitty Doll Club, a group of 16 or so Orange County 
doll collectors who stockpile donations of toys and gifts to give to the 
children at a Christmas party they organize for the government-funded agency. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Dann Reas, an Anaheim chiropractor and an amateur magician who performs at 
various charity events, provided the entertainment for this year's party. 
</P>
<P>
Manny Torrez, a vice president in charge of loan administration at El Dorado 
Bank in Orange, volunteered to play Santa after hearing about the party from 
Jody Cooper, doll club treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
Torrez, who speaks English and Spanish, found his command of the language 
useful in view of the fact that 84% of the nearly 250 children enrolled in the 
center's day-care, preschool and Head Start programs are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
The average family income for the children who attend the Head Start Program is 
$8,000 a year, officials said. Many of the families get by on incomes in the 
$3,000 to $4,000 range, however, and most have anywhere from four to nine 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Darleen Cordova, president of the Itty Bitty Doll Club and city clerk for the 
city of Stanton, said Stanton city employees have adopted one of the center's 
needy families. 
</P>
<P>
The employees of El Dorado Bank set up a "money tree" at the bank to help 
another family fulfill its Christmas wish list of food, blankets and a home 
heater. 
</P>
<P>
So far, more that $1,000 has been collected, according to Cooper, who organized 
the "adoption." PEGGY HESKETH

PETITIONS SUBMITTED TO CHANGE ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A citizens group hoping to elect City Council members by district rather than 
at large has submitted petitions with more than 4,200 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
The petition drive to change the voting procedure was launched in June by a 
group called the Non-Partisan Alliance for District Representation. Members say 
they want to make council members more responsive to voters, increase the odds 
for candidates from ethnic minorities and reduce the cost of campaigns and the 
influence of special interests. 
</P>
<P>
The group is led by Tom Collacott, a 22-year resident of Westminster whose late 
brother, Connor Collacott, was once the city's police chief. 
</P>
<P>
Collacott, 63, said the new procedure would divide the city into five districts 
with about 8,000 residents in each. A City Council candidate would be elected 
by voters in the district in which they live. 
</P>
<P>
It would also eliminate the election of mayor and leave the selection of the 
ceremonial post to the council. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason people will vote for this is because they're really tired of the 
representation Westminster has," Collacott said. "They feel they have no touch 
with the council and aren't able to reach them. This way, the council would get 
to know the people." 
</P>
<P>
Collacott lead a successful effort in 1982 to change the city's elections from 
April to November. 
</P>
<P>
At least 3,743 of the signatures, 10% of the city's registered voters, must be 
certified by the county clerk before the initiative qualifies for the November 
ballot, said City Clerk Mary Lou Morey. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Charles V. Smith, who opposes the change, said, "I think when people find 
out what it really means, the initiative will fail. In 1984, the voters passed 
an initiative by a 2-1 margin to directly elect the mayor. Historically, voters 
do not like to give up the right to vote on something once they've been given 
that right." 
</P>
<P>
If the initiative is passed by the voters, Smith would not be eligible to run 
for reelection in November, 1990, because he lives in a district already 
occupied by a council member who is not up for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Smith added that the proposed change would place constraints on each member of 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the system is set up now, any member of the council is available to 
anybody in the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, only 20 of California's 444 cities elect their city council members 
by districts. GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: 2.9 QUAKE CAN'T JOLT CALTECH INTO ACTION 
</P>

<P>
Scientists don't know exactly which fault was responsible for this week's 2.9 
earthquake, a Caltech spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the temblor was too puny to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
"They would have to actually go out and break ground" to determine if the 
temblor was along the Newport-Inglewood Fault, the county's largest, said 
Robert Finn. 
</P>
<P>
Caltech generally does not investigate a quake unless it measures at least 
magnitude 4 or 5, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The temblor was centered near the junction of the Costa Mesa and San Diego 
freeways, where the cities of Irvine, Santa Ana and Costa Mesa converge. JAMES

DISPUTE WITH CITY ENDS PLANS FOR HOTEL

<TEXT>
<P>
La Quinta Inns has dropped plans to build a three-story hotel after a dispute 
with the city. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council was told this week that the San Antonio-based company was 
withdrawing from its agreement to build the 172-room hotel on 2.8 acres on the 
southwest corner of Haster Street and Garden Grove Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The project's progress had been complicated by a dispute between the city and 
La Quinta over elevating the building because of its location in the Santa Ana 
River flood-plain area. 
</P>
<P>
The city required that the development be raised five feet above grade to 
provide flood protection, but La Quinta balked, maintaining that improvements 
in nearby levees and bridges made the elevation unnecessary. JAMES TORTOLANO

PANEL TO DELIBERATE ON IRVINE CO. LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HERZOG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials this week named a committee to begin negotiations with the 
Irvine Co. on the future of about 400 acres of vacant land the company owns in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Committee members are Mayor Ruthelyn Plummer and council members Clarence J. 
Turner and Jean H. Watt. They will negotiate to ensure preservation of open 
space and to gain funds for transportation. 
</P>
<P>
On the Irvine Co. team, selected last month, are Vice Chairman Ray Watson and 
two officials of a company subsidiary, Patrick Smith and Dave Dmohowski. 
</P>
<P>
"These properties are very significant in terms of what people are concerned 
about in Newport Beach," Watt said Tuesday. "About half of them are very 
sensitive areas, like around the bay, and we want to preserve open space and 
get a community park." 
</P>
<P>
The basis of the negotiations was laid last year, when city officials adopted a 
new land use and traffic plan within the city's general plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. then proposed a conceptual plan whereby the firm would advance 
money for road improvements. In return, the company would receive a development 
agreement to build on its remaining vacant parcels. 
</P>
<P>
"This way the city gets road funding now instead of it trickling in," said 
Dmohowski. "That's why we want to pool them all up front and look at these 
properties as a package instead of coming back on every single one and 
reinventing the wheel." 
</P>
<P>
While the precise number of parcels to be discussed has not yet been 
determined, at least six highly visible sites will be looked at in terms of 
open space preservation: 
</P>
<P>
* A 60-acre tract known as Castaways at Dover Drive and Coast Highway, site of 
the original McFadden's Wharf. The upper portion of the parcel is designated by 
the general plan for 151 residential units and 10 acres of open space. Watt 
said this parcel is the favorite potential site for a park. 
</P>
<P>
* The Newporter North parcel, about 80 acres east and north of Upper Newport 
Bay between San Joaquin Hills Road and the John Wayne Tennis Club. Under the 
general plan, 212 units are permitted, with provisions for open space. 
</P>
<P>
* The 33-acre Newport Village site on the northwest corner of the junction of 
MacArthur Boulevard and Coast Highway. The Irvine Co. gave 10 acres at the site 
for the Newport Harbor Art Museum, and four acres are under negotiation for a 
new public library site. The remaining acreage is slated in the general plan 
for about 115,000 square feet of commercial space and a four-acre park. 
</P>
<P>
* The San Diego Creek North and South sites between Jamboree Road and MacArthur 
Boulevard at the head of Upper Newport Bay. The north site totals 13 acres and 
is designated for commercial space and a fire station. The south site totals 20 
acres and is planned for 300 residential units. 
</P>
<P>
* Bayview Landing at the corner of Coast Highway and Jamboree Road. The upper 
pad of the 17-acre parcel will probably become a park, Watt said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the other sites to be considered as part of the overall package are 
zoned for commercial or residential development. Others, such as Buck Gully, 55 
acres between Coast Highway and Spyglass Hill in Corona del Mar, are designated 
to remain open space. Still others, such as five ecologically sensitive acres 
at Jamboree and MacArthur, may be preserved as open space if development rights 
can be transferred elsewhere, Dmohowski said. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary findings are expected in three to six months, Dmohowski said.

HISTORIC VILLAGE'S FUTURE UP IN THE AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Historic preservationists working to establish a park region dedicated to old 
Huntington Beach structures are discovering that balancing history and 
economics can be a tenuous, painstaking endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
Members of community historic groups are brimming with ideas for the proposed 
historic village at Bartlett Park but recently have found themselves wrestling 
with the nagging dilemma of how to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary plan for the village, which the City Council approved in July, 
calls for about half a dozen historic structures to be restored and located in 
a one-acre area atop a bluff at the park, which now includes the landmark 
Newland House site. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Historic Resources Board, which advises the council on preservation 
issues, has suggested that several old structures be included in the village, 
including a windmill and the downtown building that 85 years ago was City Hall. 
But, so far, proposals for generating income at the village have been uniformly 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Prospective developers have nixed a series of modest commercial ideas suggested 
by city planners as being financially unworkable. For example, preservationists 
had strongly urged that one or more of the old homes be transformed into a 
bed-and-breakfast accommodation, thus creating income while emphasizing 
historic preservation. 
</P>
<P>
Developers, however, argued that even several bed-and-breakfasts could not 
raise enough money to offset the cost, especially since the park, tucked away 
behind the Newland Center at Beach Boulevard and Adams Street, has poor street 
visibility. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the first firm proposals offered by a developer, recently submitted 
to the city by a group of firms calling themselves the Bartlett Park Village 
Partners Development Co., were briskly scuttled by city planners and historic 
advisers, who complained that the plans were overly commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Lambert, a city associate planner in charge of the project, said the 
firm's bid included three separate proposals. They ranged from a village 
comprising a new restaurant and four or five historic structures, which would 
incorporate a series of shops, to an attraction composed of 10 or 11 old 
buildings, including as many as six shops, in addition to the new restaurant. 
Members of the city's Historic Resources Board at a meeting this week sharply 
criticized the developer's offer. 
</P>
<P>
"That sounds to me like it's no different than a commercial strip center," said 
member Douglas Langevin. "And if this is just going to be another strip center, 
I'd rather see the (historic) buildings go down than be used that way." 
</P>
<P>
The city's Historic Issues Committee, which includes representatives from the 
board, the city planning staff and other historic preservation groups, is now 
devising guidelines that more clearly define what the members want for the 
historic village, Lambert said. JOHN PENNER

CURTIS SEEKS INQUIRY INTO RECALL ATTEMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of accusing the Mission Viejo Co. of being the sole sponsor of a 
recall campaign against him, City Councilman Robert A. Curtis this week called 
for an investigation of the developer by the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis claims that the Mission Viejo Co. was the primary source of the $156,000 
raised by the Coalition to Recall Councilman Curtis to finance a successful 
petition drive this fall. The councilman will face a recall election Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
"The Mission Viejo Co. has been calling all the shots," Curtis said. "Any 
decent investigation with subpoena power to interview people and to pull 
documents will reveal that." 
</P>
<P>
State law requires that any political campaign group receiving "all or nearly 
all of its revenue" from a single source must identify that party as a sponsor, 
said FPPC spokeswoman Sandra Michioku. 
</P>
<P>
Michioku confirmed that the agency had received Curtis' complaint but declined 
to say whether the FPPC would investigate the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter to FPPC Chairman John H. Larson, dated Dec. 12, Curtis said that 
voters "have a right to know that (the coalition) is sponsored by the Mission 
Viejo Co." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the company and the coalition denied Curtis' charges. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just another desperate allegation on his part," said Helen Monroe, 
leader of the recall group which has accused Curtis of improperly trying to 
annex Aegean Hills, a 593-acre development just outside Mission Viejo's 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
"He obviously feels that other developers are incapable of making a decision by 
themselves," she said. "That's an insult to American business." 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Wetzel, a Mission Viejo Co. spokeswoman, said the firm has "scrupulously 
complied with all campaign-reporting laws and our attorneys will be happy to 
discuss any of our (campaign financial) reports with the FPPC." 
</P>
<P>
"We believe Curtis is politicking again to divert attention from his attempt to 
annex Aegean Hills without giving Mission Viejo residents a chance to vote," 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
According to Curtis, the Mission Viejo Co. has forced business partners and 
subcontractors to contribute to the recall campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Their donation just becomes a cost of doing business with the Mission Viejo 
Co.," he alleged. 
</P>
<P>
Wetzel denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
"Individual companies make their own decisions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The action is the third complaint filed with government political watchdogs 
against the recall forces. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office is still investigating separate 
complaints of campaign violations against the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
One complaint alleges that the coalition misled voters by using a city seal on 
campaign mailers. FRANK MESSINA

GIFT STEERS SHIP FROM UNCERTAINTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Claud Sympson's eyes lit up as he watched a group of teen-agers hoisting a 
barrel up the rigging of the Pilgrim sailing ship to cries of "heave ho!" 
</P>
<P>
"Well done, well done," Sympson crowed, clapping for the students in a 
living-history course about life at sea. 
</P>
<P>
With his recent $225,000 donation, enabling the Orange County Marine Institute 
to purchase the Pilgrim, Sympson has guaranteed the permanency of education 
programs aboard the vessel that are attended by more than 60,000 students a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
A retired corporate executive, Sympson, 77 and a 40-year Anaheim resident, said 
he could easily afford the donation. The Cleveland native is a 10-year member 
of the institute's board of directors and announced his donation plans at 
Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been interested in the ocean and in kids," he said. "And with the 
two combined, it's irresistible. I'm glad my wife Jimmie and I were able to do 
this." 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit institute had been soliciting donations to purchase the two- 
masted sailing ship since 1985, when it signed a five-year contract with a 
Salinas-based consortium that has been leasing them the wooden boat. That 
contract would have expired in May if the $450,000 purchase price was not met, 
said Stan Cummings, institute director. 
</P>
<P>
"This is important for us," Cummings said, noting that Sympson's donation is 
the largest in the institute's history. "Although the Pilgrim programs are less 
than half of our operation, more people know us because of the boat than 
anything else. It's a landmark, and it's even on the city (of Dana Point)seal." 
</P>
<P>
The Pilgrim began its life under the name of Joel, built in 1945 in Denmark as 
a cargo ship for hauling grain, Cummings said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, the boat was purchased by BJW Enterprises in Salinas. It was rebuilt 
in Portugal as a replica of Richard Henry Dana's vessel, planned to serve as 
the centerpiece of a Monterey commercial development by the owners. 
</P>
<P>
When the development fell through, the boat was docked in Long Beach Harbor 
from 1977 until it arrived in Dana Point Harbor on Memorial Day in 1981, the 
first official day of business for the marine institute, Cummings recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Institute directors then authorized a $5,000 annual lease and paid for 
insurance and maintenance of the boat, while they unsuccessfully sought an 
interested buyer who would donate the ship to them. By 1985, with the living 
history program in full swing, the purchase agreement was signed to prevent the 
boat from being sold to interested private parties, Cummings said. 
</P>
<P>
Following purchase of the ship, Sympson said the institute will be free to 
pursue construction of a permanent mooring for the boat, which is now anchored 
in the west end of the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Sympson talked excitedly about future plans for the facility, which include a 
$12.5-million expansion of the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"We can start having adult classes and do more community service than we do 
now," he said. "Our goal is to educate our young people in marine life and the 
values of the ocean. This has always been the home port for the Pilgrim, and 
this (donation) is like paying off the mortgage on a house." WENDY PAULSON

LINCOLN S&amp;L OFFERS CIDER, COOKIES IN AD

Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan lost nearly a billion dollars this year and 
taxpayers are expected to pay $2 billion to repair it, but still the thrift has 
dug deep into its pockets to pay for a full-page newspaper ad inviting the 
public to share some free cider and Christmas cookies. 
</P>
<P>
The federal regulators who seized the failed thrift in April spent $37,622.85 
on an ad in Monday's Los Angeles Times to tout their hospitality. The ad 
features a picture of Santa with the following caption: "He's not the only one 
with something for you this Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
For those who don't know it, next week is "Lincoln Savings Customer 
Appreciation Week." The cookies and cider are a gesture of "a taste of the true 
spirit of Christmas," according to the ad. 
</P>
<P>
"They decided to run the ad as an expression of appreciation to the loyal 
customers who continue to do business with them," said Phil Salvati, president 
of the Costa Mesa agency that placed the ad. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials hope Santa Claus and a little apple juice can stop a 
continuing erosion in deposits at Lincoln's 29 branches. On Dec. 31 last year, 
the thrift had $4.4 billion. By Sept. 30, that figure had fallen to $3.6 
billion. The thrift lost $877 million in the first nine months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to maintain a customer base and hopefully win back some new 
customers because they don't want this thing to be a bigger problem financially 
than it already is," Salvati said. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln, which was a subsidiary of Phoenix-based American Continental Corp., is 
expected to be the costliest thrift failure ever. A congressional committee 
recently ended a series of hearings that examined how Lincoln was operated by 
American Continental and its chairman, Charles H. Keating Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The regulators running Lincoln could not be reached for comment.

It was in the dead of winter, early in 1988, when Gheorge Parvu attempted to 
cross the Romanian border into Yugoslavia. He chose January for his escape 
because, he said, guards at the heavily patrolled border "pay not as much 
attention when it is cold." 
</P>
<P>
He carried no food or water, but did have the wooden pan flute he had made 
himself. Tonight, less than two years after his escape, he will play the 
instrument in two selections with the Garden Grove Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
After making it over the border and walking for 35 miles, Parvu was arrested in 
Yugoslavia for lack of official papers and spent 15 days in a Yugoslav jail and 
15 more in a relocation camp. He lived in Belgrade for four months and 10 days 
-- he can recite the exact length of each stage of his journey -- before 
receiving permission to emigrate to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
He came to live in Anaheim in May of last year after a friendly American 
consulate, a native of San Diego, recommended Southern California as a new 
home. Parvu goes to work each afternoon as a janitor for the Placentia Unified 
School District, but he hopes to make a mark with the pan flute, an ancient 
instrument that has survived in a number of cultures. 
</P>
<P>
Named after the Greek god Pan, the instrument is a bundle of hollow wooden 
tubes of varying lengths; it is played by blowing down into the tubes. It is an 
obscure instrument in the United States, though it has been popularized 
somewhat by another Romanian, Gheorghe Zamfir, whose recordings are hawked 
relentlessly on late-night cable television. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove Symphony manager Yaakov Dvir-Djerassi heard about Parvu from 
another musician and arranged a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we're concerned, we always look for the unusual," Dvir-Djerassi 
said. Parvu auditioned in November, 1988, and was worked into this year's 
holiday program, which also features the Vocalworks quartet. Parvu will perform 
with the orchestra during "O Holy Night" and an arrangement of a Romanian folk 
tune, "A Floral Dance." 
</P>
<P>
Parvu has played during services at several area churches, but tonight's 
concert is his biggest performance since his arrival in the United States. He 
first heard the pan flute on the radio, as a child in Romania. He immediately 
told his father, a pianist, that he wanted to learn the instrument. He studied 
with Zamfir, among others, performed on several recordings and was featured on 
national television. 
</P>
<P>
But musical success was not enough to keep him in Romania. His father was a 
dissident who was jailed twice; Gheorge converted to Christianity in 1980 and 
repeatedly was persecuted for his beliefs. So he escaped. 
</P>
<P>
"In Romania, we have very good people. It's a very nice country," Parvu said. 
But, he added, the totalitarian government is another matter. He enjoys his 
new-found freedom -- "I'm very happy," he said. "This is my new country" -- but 
he worries about his homeland, which has so far been untouched by the wave of 
democratization sweeping Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"I have pain for my country, because every country in Eastern Europe, they have 
victory," Parvu said. 
</P>
<P>
Change, he hopes, will come soon: "All the time I hope, because is not hope, is 
not life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Garden Grove Symphony presents "Christmas Vignettes," a program of 
traditional and contemporary Christmas music featuring jazz ensemble 
Vocalworks, Romanian pan-flutist Gheorge Parvu and violinist Mischa Lefkowitz, 
at 8 p.m. at the Don Wash Auditorium, Stanford Avenue and Euclid Street, Garden 
Grove. Tickets: $7 to $25. Information: (714) 534-1103.

'OZ' ITEMS FAIL TO SELL AT AUCTION 
</P>

Five figurines believed to be the original prototypes for characters in the 
1939 MGM film "The Wizard of Oz" failed to draw a minimum bid Thursday at an 
auction at Christie's in New York, according to the statues' owner, Lidia 
Penge. 
</P>
<P>
Penge, 30, of Dana Point had hoped to net at least $10,000 for the Dorothy, Tin 
Man, Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow and Professor Marvel figurines that she 
discovered six years ago in a warehouse inherited from her mother, MGM child 
actress Jackie Horner. But, Penge said Friday, no one would bid more than 
$5,000 and no sale was transacted. 
</P>
<P>
According to "Oz" specialist Rhys Thomas, who was called in by Christie's to 
authenticate the figurines, the one-of-a-kind, hand-painted plaster models were 
made by MGM artists sometime between May and October of 1938 and were given to 
Jackie Horner by producer Louis B. Mayer's secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Penge, who works as an accountant in Laguna Niguel, decided to place the 
statues on the auction block last September after hearing about a pair of "Oz" 
ruby slippers that netted $165,000 at auction in June, 1988. She hoped that 
interest in the statues would be especially high this year, given the publicity 
surrounding the film's 50th anniversary.

GRAVEYARD SHIFT BLURS OFFICERS' DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For police officers on the graveyard shift in Philadelphia, each day can be a 
blur of confusion, fatigue and malaise. The stress builds up over time, 
producing high rates of alcohol and sleeping pill use, accidents and 
estrangement in families. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is in the schedule, not the job, said neuroscientist Charles 
Czeisler of Harvard Medical School. According to Czeisler, the typical 
schedule, which rotates officers through graveyard, evening and day shifts, 
fails to accommodate the body's natural circadian rhythm -- the biological 
clock -- which controls individual sleep-wake cycles. 
</P>
<P>
Czeisler redesigned the schedule of a group of Philadelphia police officers and 
detectives. The new schedule made three major changes. 
</P>
<P>
First, workers changed shifts every 18 days rather than every eight days, 
allowing more time to adjust to the change. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the rotation shifted forward -- from day, to evening, to graveyard -- 
rather than backward as before. Since the typical circadian clock runs on about 
a 25-hour day, the natural tendency is to shift to a later hour; shifting to an 
earlier hour makes readjustment more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Third, Czeisler reduced the number of consecutive days worked from six to four 
to allow officers to catch up on sleep, thereby avoiding the cumulative sleep 
deprivation night-shift workers often experience. 
</P>
<P>
After 11 months on the new schedule, officers reported significant declines in 
sleep problems, sleepiness on the job and fatigue and an increase in alertness. 
</P>
<P>
On-the-job automobile accidents fell by 40%, sleeping pill and alcohol usage 
dropped 50% and sick time declined 23%. 
</P>
<P>
Family satisfaction with the new schedule increased fivefold. Although the 
quantity of time spent with families remained about the same, the quality 
improved. Officers said they felt more rested, more energetic and less 
irritable.

CABS WILL DELIVER DRINKERS INTACT FOR PRICE OF A PHONE CALL

You've spent the last few hours at your favorite watering hole lifting a glass 
to Christmas, Santa Claus, Mrs. Claus, all eight reindeer, the guy on the end 
who can remember each of their names, the bartender, the bartender's Christmas 
tie, Gorbachev, glasnost, Gemutlichkeit, your grandmother's turkey stuffing, 
the infield fly rule, the 1967 MGB, Bing Crosby, "White Christmas," USC, the 
end of the '80s, Hanukkah, spaghetti carbonara and the invention of mistletoe. 
It's been a truly high-spirited evening. 
</P>
<P>
And then you climb down off the bar stool, take that first step toward the 
parking lot and you suddenly get . . . 
</P>
<P>
That Old Sinking Feeling. 
</P>
<P>
You realize that you've not only forgotten where you put your car, you're not 
sure you even remember where you put your keys. What you do remember, however, 
with stark clarity, is that somewhere out there in the night are lots and lots 
of cops who would feel pretty good about taking you to jail if they see you 
behind the wheel of your car. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, you're 15 miles from home and every sober person you know who 
could drive you home went to bed hours ago. 
</P>
<P>
This holiday season, however, there are alternatives to a very long walk home 
or a very uncomfortable night in the slammer. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most visible is a program called CareCab, sponsored by Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving and Care Unit Hospital of Orange. The program offers the 
holiday reveler who has had one or more too many a free ride home by Yellow Cab 
within 20 miles of the pickup point (the customer pays for any additional 
mileage). 
</P>
<P>
The program is designed to take people home from public places where alcohol is 
served, such as restaurants and bars -- private parties don't qualify -- and 
the deal is good only within the borders of Orange County. Also, the customer 
must call the Care Unit toll-free number (1 (800) 422-4143) in order to qualify 
for the free service. 
</P>
<P>
CareCab will operate from Dec. 24 through Jan. 2 from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow Cab of North Orange County and Orange Coast Yellow Cab, based in 
Fountain Valley, also participate in a program called Taxi Time. Similar to 
CareCab, Taxi Time is sponsored by a group of Orange County beer distributors: 
Southland Beverage, Quality Beer Distributors, Consolidated Beverage 
Distributors, Coors Distributing Co. and Straub Distributing Co. 
</P>
<P>
Operating from the evening of Dec. 22 through the evening of Jan. 1 (there are 
no set operating hours), Taxi Time will provide a Yellow Cab at a public place 
and will take the customer home free of charge within 25 miles in Orange 
County. The service does not pick up customers from Laguna Beach south to the 
San Diego County line. 
</P>
<P>
Rides may be obtained from Yellow Cab of North Orange County by calling (714) 
535-2211. The number of Orange Coast Yellow Cab is (714) 546-1311. 
</P>
<P>
For high school students who may find themselves in no condition to drive home, 
many Orange County high schools offer confidential free rides home through 
chapters of Safe Rides. Through the year-around program, groups of students 
belonging to a Safe Rides Explorer Post (the program is sponsored by the Orange 
County Council of the Boy Scouts of America) will pick up fellow students from 
the post's school and drive them home, primarily on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Council of the Boy Scouts of America (546-4990) can provide 
the names of high schools participating in the Safe Rides program, and the high 
schools themselves can provide the phone number of their own Safe Rides 
Explorer Posts. PATRICK MOTT

DROP IN ALCOHOL-RELATED DEATHS INDICATE CAMPAIGN IS PAYING OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Is it all worth it? 
</P>
<P>
The long nights patrolling the streets and highways, filling the backs of 
police cars with drunk driving suspects, the education programs in schools and 
workplaces, the speeches, the warnings, the discussions, the designated-driver 
plans, the sobriety checkpoints, the stiffer penalties, and the litany that 
accompanies the campaign against drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
Has it helped? 
</P>
<P>
The answer may lie in a single statistic, provided by the California Highway 
Patrol: In 1988, there were 134 alcohol-related traffic deaths in Orange 
County, 32 fewer than in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
And, according to the state Bureau of Criminal Justice Statistics, the number 
of deaths in 1989 may drop still further. Only 47 alcohol-related traffic 
fatalities were reported in Orange County in the first six months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
What makes this single statistic even more significant is that the number of 
alcohol-related traffic deaths in the county was pretty consistent throughout 
most of the '80s. For example, between 1983 and 1987, the number went no higher 
than 166 (1987) and no lower than 151 (1984). Therefore, the sudden drop in 
deaths would appear to mean that the message of "Don't Drive Drunk" is finally 
getting through. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people certainly have become more aware of the problem," said Janet 
Cater, the director of the Orange County chapter of Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, the message has been getting out there," she said. "Our 
chapter has done a lot of proactive preventive programs. We kicked off our 
designated-driver program in 1986; we've had increased speaking time at the 
high schools; we've broadened the base of our newsletter. And we started our 
community recognition dinner in 1987, where we honor the top officers from each 
police department who have the highest number of arrests and convictions. I 
think that encourages law enforcement to pay more attention to drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"The prevention is paying off, and we're delighted about it." 
</P>
<P>
So is the California Highway Patrol, whose officers are noticing that drunk 
driving has become less of a laughing matter in the public. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be if somebody told you they'd been arrested for drunk driving, 
people might laugh," CHP spokeswoman Officer Angel Johnson said. "Now the 
message is getting across that people don't like it. They don't want it 
anymore. More people are becoming aware that it's not a joke, that it's a 
potentially dangerous situation." 
</P>
<P>
Increasing the visibility of law enforcement activities such as sobriety 
checkpoints also help, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the holidays, particularly, we put more people on the road just looking 
for (drunk) drivers," she said. "And the courts are helping. The penalties are 
becoming much stiffer, and people are taking notice of that, too. People know 
that we're out there and that we're more conscious and aware of them." PATRICK
