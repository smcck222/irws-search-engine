ARNOLD MOSS; VERSATILE STAGE, FILM, TV ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arnold Moss, a classical actor of diverse ability who was best known for his 
Shakespeare repertoire yet was a favored villain in films and in the early days 
of television, died Friday of lung cancer in his home in New York City. He was 
80. 
</P>
<P>
Moss headed a Shakespearean company, starred in daytime TV soap operas and 
recorded and performed as a narrator with many symphony orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
Moss was praised by critics for his performances as Prospero in "The Tempest" 
in 1945 and as Malvolio in "Twelfth Night" in 1949. He formed his own repertory 
company, the Shakespeare Festival Players, and toured 50 American colleges. 
</P>
<P>
In movies, he often played the heavy and appeared in "Viva Zapata," "Salome," 
"Kim," "Gambit," "Casanova's Big Night" and "My Favorite Spy." 
</P>
<P>
Moss narrated with the Boston, Detroit and Milwaukee orchestras and provided 
the voice of God for the 1978 Chicago Lyric Opera production of "Paradise 
Lost," doubling as poet John Milton. 
</P>
<P>
He began his stage career as an actor-director at Eva LeGallienne's Civic 
Repertory Theatre in New York, where his first stage appearance was as an 
Indian in a 1929 production of "Peter Pan." 
</P>
<P>
The ruthless Spanish colonel in Ernest Hemingway's "The Fifth Column" was his 
first major Broadway role, and Moss went on to win approval for his parts in 
"The Front Page," "Flight to the West," and "Journey to Jerusalem." 
</P>
<P>
Moss also performed on radio as a spokesman for the New York Philharmonic 
Orchestra and as a staff announcer for CBS Radio in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department sent him to Latin America, Africa and the Far East as a 
specialist in theater.

GLADYS BURR; WOMAN WRONGFULLY COMMITTED TO MENTAL INSTITUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gladys Burr, 82, who spent 42 years in state institutions after being 
mistakenly labeled as mentally retarded. Miss Burr was 29 in 1936 when family 
members had her committed to Norwich State Hospital in Connecticut because of 
what they said were emotional outbursts. Miss Burr stayed there for 42 years 
despite IQ tests that proved her of normal intelligence. In 1978 an attorney, 
Richard Altshuler, wrote the state Department of Mental Retardation to ask why 
she had been kept institutionalized. A few days after he sent the letter, Miss 
Burr was released. She won a $235,000 settlement from the state in 1985. In 
Bridgeport, Conn., on Thursday.

PORTER MOVE: QUESTIONABLE PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times on Sunday encouraged Mayor Tom Bradley to hold to his commendable 
insistence that the proposed $2-billion Porter Ranch development be 
significantly modified so as to ease its impact on the northwest San Fernando 
Valley. Just at deadline time, the mayor's office has subsequently revealed, 
Bradley and Councilman Hal Bernson were cutting a deal that achieves some of 
the mayor's demands, but far from all. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson, whose district includes Porter Ranch, said he supported the project of 
developer Nathan Shapell in part because of the attendant public works that 
Shapell would finance, such as highway access and land for schools. OK, but the 
scope of the Chatsworth-area project that will spread across 1,300 acres of 
hillsides makes it the biggest such development in city history. The mitigation 
agreement worked out last week would not significantly reduce the traffic 
congestion and air pollution to result from more than 3,000 homes and town 
houses and some 6 million square feet of office and shop space. More to the 
point, Shapell did not have to back down on the density of the lucrative 
commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
That the project will feature some additional affordable housing and a transit 
system is because the mayor chose to challenge it at all. The fact that the 
mayor did not get all he might have is no reason to flatly oppose the 
development. Still, one has to wonder about the land-use approval process: 
Should such major decisions be negotiated this late in the game almost 
exclusively, in private, by a mayor and a city councilman? 
</P>
<P>
Eyebrows inevitably will arch when it is understood that Shapell contributed 
more than $11,000 to Bernson's campaign fund and more than $40,000 to Bradley's 
in the past five years. Credibility is stretched even further when the public 
learns that former city Planning Commission Chairman Dan Garcia provided 
Shapell with legal expertise in getting the project through the city 
bureaucracy. And Shapell's lobbyist is Robert M. Wilkinson, who used to 
represent the Porter Ranch area on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
There is no suggestion that Shapell's contributions got him anything. Nor is it 
to suggest that the decision is necessarily a bad one because so many vested 
interests had their hands in the action. But if ever a project seemed to have 
high-powered influence behind it at City Hall, this one did. 
</P>
<P>
The history of Porter Ranch is a case study in the urgent need for effective 
campaign finance reform in Los Angeles and throughout Southern California. Even 
the suspicion that Shapell's big campaign bucks and his high-priced lobbying 
talent might have gotten him special treatment at any point strains the 
integrity and credibility of the system.

IT'S JUST NOT THE AMERICAN WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Felix S. Bloch of the U.S. Foreign Service won't declare himself innocent of 
spying, we certainly are not going to put words in his mouth. But after seven 
months of surveillance, eavesdropping and investigation of his bank and tax 
records, the Federal Bureau of Investigation seems unable to make a case that 
he is guilty, either. It makes us uneasy that in a country that puts so much 
store by individual rights, Bloch will be punished anyway, at least by the loss 
of his State Department job, and that official Washington continues to give the 
impression that he is guilty until proven innocent. 
</P>
<P>
This cloak-and-dagger affair began earlier this year, months after Bloch 
returned from a tour at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, when U.S. intelligence 
officials claim that they intercepted and recorded an incriminating telephone 
call from a man they say is a Soviet spy and but who Bloch says is nothing more 
than a fellow stamp collector. Tipped by the call, French agents are said to 
have watched Bloch hand over a bag to the Soviet in a Paris restaurant sometime 
last May. After that Bloch was followed, if not hounded, by the FBI for months. 
In an almost comic touch, Bloch and his FBI tail were trailed by a band of 
cameras and reporters once the story became public in June. 
</P>
<P>
Sources told The Times last week that the same kind of analysis of financial 
records that helped put Chicago's notorious Al Capone in jail for income tax 
evasion failed to yield a clue in Bloch's case. This would seem to mean that 
Bloch either buried any money he got for handing over secrets or that he worked 
for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
Even without hard evidence, a spy story ought to hold together better than the 
Bloch case seems to do. If he did do favors for a Soviet agent -- who knows, he 
may after all be guilty as sin -- it seems that Washington will never know what 
they were. If he did not, Washington will have humiliated him for naught. One 
official told The Times that the case "is coming out the worst possible way." 
We can't disagree with that statement.

ESCUADRON DE LA MUERTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Could death squads from El Salvador be operating here? Most people would 
instinctively call that impossible and blot out the thought that the terrible 
brutality of that country's civil war is a problem for the many Salvadoran 
refugees who have fled to the United States. But in the large refugee 
community, people aren't so sure. That's why last week's action by Los Angeles 
Police, who named a local Salvadoran businessman as a suspect in death 
squad-style threats against local priests and refugees, is important. It says 
that law enforcement is determined not to let the grisly battles of El Salvador 
surface in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
The validity of the allegations will have to be determined in a court of law 
when and if Carlos Rene Mata, 35, is formally charged. Mata, the proprietor of 
an overnight delivery firm that ships goods between Central America and the 
United States, is already in jail on suspicion of receiving stolen property and 
of threatening a former employee of his company, Pipil Express. He also faces 
trial in U.S. District Court on charges that he smuggled illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
Allegations of Mata's possible links to death squads in El Salvador were 
contained in an affidavit filed last week by a police detective involved in the 
continuing investigation of his activities. The FBI, the U.S. Customs Service 
and Immigration and Naturalization Service are also involved in the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Death squads are a frightening aspect of the long Salvadoran war. Bands of 
right-wing thugs who harass and intimidate their political opponents with 
threats, kidnapings and murder, the death squads have killed almost as many 
people as have died in combat. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that death squads might be in Los Angeles was first raised in 
1987, after three kidnapings of Salvadoran refugees, one of them a woman who 
was also raped by her abductors. About the same time, local priests active in 
helping Central American refugees also revealed that they had received 
telephoned death threats and anonymous notes signed with the initials "E.M.," 
which stands for Escuadron de la Muerte -- Spanish for death squad. Similar 
threats were recently reported by two local refugee agencies. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1987 incidents, police and the FBI assigned investigators to 
determine if they might be linked. It is still not known whether the probe of 
Mata and his company grew out of those incidents. In any event, the actions 
taken against Mata send a signal to the entire community: Allegations of 
death-squad activity are taken seriously in Los Angeles, and death squads will 
not be tolerated here. And anyone inclined to take the dangers posed by death 
squads lightly should recall how Chilean dissident Orlando Letelier was 
murdered by Gen. Augusto Pinochet's secret police on the streets of Washington 
in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 300,000 Salvadorans live here, so it's impossible to keep the 
tragedy of El Salvador from crossing national borders and brushing the lives of 
emigrants. But if law enforcement is vigilant, the bloodshed of that war will 
never spill onto the streets of Los Angeles.

STOLEN VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although the district attorney says he will prosecute stolen vehicle crimes as 
a felony when deception is used, I now understand why Southern California's 
hottest crime is stolen vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Recently our stolen truck -- now repainted with different license plates and 
tires -- was recovered during a theft. The suspect fled the scene, violated 
numerous traffic laws, had opened beer cans in the vehicle, and several buyers' 
business cards for the stolen goods. The suspect's name is still unclear as he 
uses five aliases and has a record. Qualifies as a felony, right? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong! The thief was permitted to plead to a misdemeanor petty theft charge for 
stolen goods. That's right -- petty theft! 
</P>
<P>
Because repairs were too costly, the insurance company salvaged the truck, and 
we have a $2,000 loss. I have called the district attorney's office daily 
asking for restitution, but no one has returned my calls. As I said, I now know 
why so many vehicles are stolen in Los Angeles County -- it pays! And if 
caught, the criminal gets free room and board for a few months and is then back 
on the streets continuing his career. 
</P>
<P>
How sad that the greatest country on earth has a judicial system that favors 
criminals.

SOVIETS CONFESS THEIR MISBEHAVIOR; WILL WE?; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: AMERICA HAS LOTS OF INTERVENTIONIST OFFENSES TO RECANT, BUT THAT REQUIRES 
A MEASURE OF HUMILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. SCHEFFER, David J. Scheffer is a lawyer and a senior associate of 
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Humility is a rare virtue in international politics. Voluntary admissions of 
illegal conduct in the global arena are practically unknown. Yet in recent 
weeks the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact have acted with extraordinary 
humility to acknowledge some of their unlawful behavior during the Cold War. 
Such actions test America's own commitment to the rule of international law. 
</P>
<P>
On his return from the Malta summit, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
gathered the embattled leadership of the Warsaw Pact in Moscow. The Soviet 
government issued a unilateral declaration that called the invasion of 
Czechoslovakia by Soviet Bloc troops in 1968 both "unfounded" and "erroneous." 
Then Gorbachev joined with leaders from Bulgaria, Hungary, East Germany and 
Poland (which participated in the invasion) to admit that their actions were 
"an interference in (the) internal affairs of Czechoslovakia and should be 
condemned." 
</P>
<P>
The Brezhnev doctrine, which originated as Moscow's legal justification for the 
invasion, is dead. For two decades, this notorious doctrine sought to justify 
Soviet intervention in socialist countries to preserve Communist rule. The 
declarations in Moscow were not merely words of contrition that bury the 
Brezhnev doctrine; the deeds of the Warsaw Pact also reflect a new era of 
nonintervention. In late October, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze appeared before the Supreme Soviet and owned up to two other 
illegal acts. He cited United Nations condemnations of the Soviet war in 
Afghanistan and asked, "what other evidence did we need to realize that we had 
set ourselves against all humanity, violated norms of behavior, ignored 
universal human values?" (Unfortunately, the continued flow of Soviet and U.S. 
arms to warring parties in Afghanistan long after Soviet troops have withdrawn 
leaves this particular example of aggression unresolved.) And he conceded that 
the Krasnoyarsk radar installation "the size of an Egyptian pyramid" was "a 
clear violation" of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the United States. 
This statement contradicted years of official Soviet denials of the illegality 
of the radar. At a time when differing interpretations of the ABM Treaty 
continue to threaten the success of strategic arms control talks, the Soviet 
admission takes one issue off the table. 
</P>
<P>
Such testimony reminds us that the law of nations is no fiction; it is a 
driving force behind the revolutionary changes occurring in the old socialist 
bloc. The standards erected by international law increasingly help define the 
credibility of both old and new political leaders there. That some officials 
are courageous enough to expose and admit illegal behavior fortunately defies 
historical precedent. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government frequently condemns the illegal conduct of other nations. 
But humility is not Washington's strong suit. Neither the Bush Administration 
nor Congress is likely to acknowledge any illegal conduct by the United States 
during or after the Cold War. Nonetheless, there are some examples worth 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
During the Vietnam War, the United States carpet-bombed parts of Cambodia, a 
country against which it was not at war. The devastating bombing campaign, kept 
secret from Congress and the American public for years by the Nixon 
Administration, remains obscured by a public record of hopelessly flawed 
legalistic excuses. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the covert actions undertaken with U.S. help in Latin America 
challenged international norms. These acts included assistance in overthrowing 
governments in Guatemala and Chile, mining harbors and bombing economic targets 
in Nicaragua and trying to assassinate political leaders. After the aborted 
Oct. 3 coup in Panama, the Bush Administration resurrected such follies with 
its reported plans to topple Manuel Noriega and with a loosened interpretation 
of the ban on assassinations. 
</P>
<P>
The right to counter-intervene against Soviet Bloc interventions in the Third 
World dominated the political rhetoric of the 1980s. But the Bush 
Administration eventually will have to scrap the Reagan doctrine in favor of a 
more enlightened policy on the use of military force. As the post-Cold War 
world transforms the threats confronting the United States, Washington must 
conceive a much different doctrine on both the use and non-use of force in the 
1990s. That task requires that unqualified allegiance for "freedom fighters" 
yield to more humble considerations about the legality of intervening in 
regional disputes. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has not yet eclipsed the United States as the traditional 
guardian of international law. But restoring credibility to the rule of law in 
a new world order may require an occasional act of humility even by our 
leaders.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;

<P>
TIME TO MOVE AGAINST FLOODING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For several years now, authorities have been racing against time to build 
critically needed flood-control protections into the Santa Ana River before a 
major flood comes. After more than 20 years of negotiating, a formal agreement 
clearing the way for the river improvements has at last been signed. 
</P>
<P>
While federal, state and local representatives have tried to come up with a 
compromise on the costs and construction of the flood-control improvements, 
hanging over their heads has been the U.S. Army's Corps of Engineers' ominous 
designation tabbing the Santa Ana River as the worst potential flood threat in 
the Western United States. If a flood occurred, it could take an estimated 
3,000 lives and cause billions of dollars in property damage. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday's agreement by Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino county 
officials and the Army Engineers finally gets the $1.1-billion project moving. 
The goal now must be to get the flood-control protections in as quickly as 
possible.

Re: "Merit Only" College Entry Proposal (Dec. 9): 
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding the charts, tables, reports, studies and other hype presented 
in defense, the disproportionate number of outstanding Asian-Americans who have 
been turned away from certain California public universities and professional 
schools reinforces my belief that de facto discrimination in admissions 
practices is indeed going on in these institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of affirmative action is to help those minority students not 
proportionately represented on the campuses better their academic performance 
so they can gain admission to our institutions of higher learning. The intent 
is not to permit quotas to override other criteria. Asian-Americans value 
learning and are willing to work hard. America has much to gain if their 
pursuit of excellence is rewarded. The Bakke ruling reaffirmed merit as a 
determining criterion in judging admissibility to a UC medical school. The 
Olympic gold is awarded only for excellence. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher is to be 
complimented for his wisdom in sponsoring a congressional resolution which 
speaks to this inequity. The purpose of our institutions of higher learning is 
to pursue the truth. And excellence.

The Chargers announced Monday that Steve Ortmayer, director of football 
operations since January 1987, will not be offered a contract next season. 
Ortmayer cleaned out his office at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium and left at 
mid afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve and I met today," Charger Owner Alex Spanos said. "I want to thank him 
for the effort he has made to make the Chargers a stronger team. Our meeting 
was amicable, and we wish him well in future endeavors." 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer, 45, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation throughout the season that Spanos was considering 
replacing Ortmayer with Bobby Beathard, former general manager of the 
Washington Redskins who left the Redskins at the conclusion of the 1988 season. 
Spanos said last May that he planned to "make an effort to hire" Beathard, and 
that he had discussed his intentions with Ortmayer. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard, who owns a home in Leucadia, was with the Redskins for 10 years. 
During that time, Washington played in three Super Bowls and Beathard earned a 
reputation for having a keen eye for talent. 
</P>
<P>
Sources have said Beathard may be reluctant to accept a position with the 
Chargers because of Spanos' propensity to involve himself heavily with draft 
and trade decisions. Beathard, currently a once-a-week television commentator 
for NBC, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer, the director of football operations for the Raiders from 1978 through 
January of 1987, has had his share of peaks and valleys with the Chargers. In 
1988, the Chargers' first pick was Anthony Miller, now one of the top receivers 
in the AFC. Also drafted in '88 was tackle David Richards, who has started all 
31 games since. 
</P>
<P>
This season's draft picks included defensive end Burt Grossman (eighth 
selection), quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver (51) and running back Marion Butts 
(183). Grossman has added strength to the Chargers' pass rush, Tolliver 
recently took the starting job from Jim McMahon and Butts rushed for a 
season-high 176 yards in Sunday's 20-13 victory over Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
But if Ortmayer's drafting was his strength, his trades were undoubtedly his 
undoing. He gambled and lost in trading for Chip Banks in 1987. Banks is now 
with Indianapolis. He sat out all of last season and was arrested four times on 
drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
Several Charger players have expressed dissatisfaction over Ortmayer's contract 
negotiations. Heading that list is running back Gary Anderson, who sat out this 
season because he could not come to terms with the Chargers. Anderson was the 
team's MVP last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he really dealt with me wrong at the beginning of the season," said 
Anderson, in a telephone interview from his home in Tampa, Fla. "(Other Charger 
players) who have dealt with him in the past seem like they have had a hard 
time getting contracts also." 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer was also responsible for trading all-pro offensive lineman Jim Lachey 
to the Raiders for Napoleon McCallum and offensive lineman John Clay. McCallum 
was cut in training camp this season. Clay will probably not play again because 
of a neck injury. Sources say that Spanos put pressure on Ortmayer before that 
trade, telling him he had 24 hours to do something with Lachey. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the verdict is still not in on the trade for McMahon, who is now an 
$800,000-a-year backup and not exactly a gem from a public relations 
standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Coach Dan Henning expressed regret at Ortmayer's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed that Steve won't be with us," Henning said. "I've had an 
excellent relationship with him. I think he's done a good job in the time that 
I've been here. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him handle the draft as well as it can be handled, and I think we had an 
outstanding draft. I've seen him put a great deal of time and effort into 
getting things where they ought to be. And I see the progress. But wins and 
losses . . . that's what we have to do a better job of." 
</P>
<P>
Other Charger coaches had similar reactions. 
</P>
<P>
"Surprised and very disappointed," defensive coordinator Ron Lynn said. "I like 
Steve Ortmayer, and I think he's done a great job. I think he's been very 
supportive of what (the coaches) have been trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
Center/guard Dennis McKnight, the Chargers' player representative, said the 
blame for the team's 5-10 record cannot be piled entirely on Ortmayer's 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he took a lot of abuse about the trades, but I wasn't of the belief 
that they were solely his decision," McKnight said. "I'm sure Mr. Spanos gave 
the final OK. It's hard to blame all those things that happened on one man. Mr. 
Spanos is a successful businessman, and I think he wants to win in the worst 
way." 
</P>
<P>
As player representative, McKnight had the opportunity to deal with Ortmayer on 
a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an OK guy to me," McKnight said. "That's a very high pressure job. Your 
head is on the block. You've got to win." 
</P>
<P>
In Ortmayer's three seasons, the Chargers were 19-27 and made no playoff 
appearances. That starkly contrasts his tenure with the Raiders, who were in 
the playoffs five times during Ortmayer's nine seasons, including two Super 
Bowl victories. 
</P>
<P>
Others likely to be dismissed by the Chargers at the end of this season are 
Chet Franklin, the director of player personnel, and Les Miller, the director 
of college scouting. Both were hired by Ortmayer. 
</P>
<P>
Staff writer Brian Hewitt also contributed to this story.

Quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver is probable for Sunday's season finale with the 
Denver Broncos with a contusion in the leg. Tackle Joel Patten (hand) is also 
probable.

BULLETS REACH .500 WITHOUT INJURED WILLIAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GOLDSTEIN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LANDOVER, Md. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When all-purpose forward John Williams went down Nov. 25 with a knee injury 
that will keep him sidelined until February, some Washington Bullets fans were 
ready to panic. 
</P>
<P>
Even with Williams, the Bullets had been given slim chance of making the 
playoffs in the National Basketball Assn.'s Eastern Conference. Without his 
consistent scoring to help team leaders Jeff Malone and Bernard King share the 
offensive load, it was considered mission impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Bullets Coach Wes Unseld said other players would have to fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
It sounded like so much rhetoric, but that is exactly what has happened during 
the last four games -- beginning with a tough road loss against the defending 
champion Detroit Pistons, followed by consecutive home victories over the Los 
Angeles Lakers, Charlotte Hornets and Dallas Mavericks that have lifted the 
Bullets back to .500 at 11-11. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Alarie, who averaged a modest 6.6 points as a reserve his first three 
seasons in the NBA, has blossomed while starting in place of Williams. During 
that time, he is averaging 15 points and five rebounds while shooting 56 
percent from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, we miss all the things Williams does that help us to win," said King, 
who scored a season-high 31 to pace the 112-108 victory over the Mavericks 
Saturday night. "But Mark is an excellent outside shooter. The opposition has 
to defense his outside shot, so that helps open things up in the middle for me 
and Jeff." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday's victory also produced surprising offensive contributions from point 
guard Darrell Walker and center Charles Jones, players known best for defense 
and rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, with 15 points on six for eight from the field, and Jones, with 10 on 
four for four, both scored season highs. Walker's eight points in the third 
quarter, including a pair of rainbow jump shots and a sensational stuff of a 
rebound, sparked the Bullets' comeback after Dallas had shot 61 percent in the 
first half to gain a 65-57 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone on this team has stepped up another level to make sure the job gets 
done. Even C.J. (Charles Jones, averaging 2.8 points) had some finger rolls," 
King said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
King, in particular, has stepped up his offensive production since Williams' 
injury. King, a veteran small forward, was averaging 15.8 points after the 
first six games. In the last seven, however, he has averaged 22.1, raising his 
season mark to 17.9. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, he converted consecutive jump shots in the final two minutes, 
including the game-winner with 61 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that John is out, Bernard has simply picked up the slack," said Walker, 
who also was a teammate of King on the New York Knicks four years ago. "Both 
Bernard and Jeff know that they're going to get most of the attention from the 
defense. That's why the rest of us have to score more than usual." 
</P>
<P>
The offense has not suffered during Williams' absence. In fact, Washington has 
averaged 105 points over the last four games, compared with 103.6 before. 
</P>
<P>
But Unseld still is looking for more offensive help from his reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Backcourt substitute Ledell Eackles is in a shooting slump, hitting 42.6 
percent of his shots (20 for 47) during his last five games while averaging 10 
points. Power forward Tom Hammonds, the team's No. 1 draft pick from Georgia 
Tech, is averaging 3.4 points, and reserve center Mel Turpin, after an 
encouraging start, has picked up quick fouls and been ineffectual on offense. 
</P>
<P>
The Bullets were short-handed at guard Saturday night because Steve Colter has 
been keeping watch at the maternity ward in Howard County Hospital, where his 
wife, LaTanya, gave birth to a girl late that evening. 
</P>
<P>
Colter will rejoin the team Tuesday night when the Bullets get their first look 
at the expansion Minnesota Timberwolves.

ALLEN REJECTS OFFER BY LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Ram Coach George Allen said Monday he turned down an offer to coach 
football at Cal State Long Beach, prompting university officials to scramble 
for an alternative candidate in time for today's scheduled 2 p.m. news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I could have helped the school, but I have not accepted the job," 
Allen said from his office at the National Fitness Foundation in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Allen met with 49er Athletic Director Corey Johnson over the weekend, but no 
agreement could be reached. Salary was one problem, since no 49er football 
coach has ever been paid more than $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the school still has contracts to keep all seven assistants from 
the staff of former coach Larry Reisbig, 11-24 in three years at the school, 
resigned in November. 
</P>
<P>
With Allen apparently out of the picture, the speculation is that Johnson 
intends to offer the job to New Orleans Saint assistant John Pease. An airline 
ticket for this morning from Dallas to Long Beach was bought in Pease's name, 
apparently by Johnson, who booked the first part of the connecting flight from 
New Orleans under his own name. 
</P>
<P>
However, before taking the field for Monday night's game between the Saints and 
the Philadelphia Eagles, Pease told reporters in New Orleans that he had not 
heard from Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Pease, 46, attended and later was an assistant coach at Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
Others interviewed by Long Beach included University of Pittsburgh assistant 
Bill Meyers, USC defensive coordinator Chris Allen and El Camino College Coach 
John Featherstone.

FOOTBALL: PHILADELPHIA FAILS IN QUEST TO WRAP UP NFC EAST TITLE BY LOSING 
FOUR-HOUR GAME.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Parcells, coach of the New York Giants, had his "Who Dat" face on Monday 
night rooting for the New Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
Now that they've beaten the Philadelphia Eagles and put New York within a game 
of the NFC East title, he might send a few "Who Dat" thank you cards to John 
Fourcade, Eric Martin, Frank Warren and the rest of the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being out of the playoffs for the first time in two years, the Saints 
(8-7) beat Philadelphia, 30-20, keeping the Eagles from clinching a playoff 
spot by knocking them a game behind the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Fourcade threw for three touchdown passes, two to Martin, and Warren had three 
sacks, one of them on Randall Cunningham in the end zone for a safety. Fourcade 
completed 18 of 35 passes for 236 yards and Martin had nine catches for 120 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia (10-5) can still clinch a wild-card spot by beating Phoenix at 
home next weekend, but the Eagles will need help from the Raiders, who play the 
Giants, to win the division title. If the Eagles and Giants finish with the 
same record, the Eagles win the division by virtue of beating the Giants twice 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
There were several ironies in this Monday night game that lasted almost four 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
For one, the Saints beat the Eagles at their own game, forcing four turnovers 
and converting three into touchdowns. Philadelphia entered the game leading the 
NFL with a plus-24 turnover ratio, 13 better than any other team. 
</P>
<P>
"We just kept the pressure on them," linebacker Vaughn Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
A blocked field goal with 3:02 to play iced it for New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
For another, the man who helped the Giants, Fourcade, was once cut by New York. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a headache for two hours," Fourcade said after a game in which he was 
sacked five times by the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
Two fumbles by Philadelphia led to two early touchdown passes of 13 yards to 
Eric Martin and 35 to Dalton Hilliard that gave the Saints an early 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles scored 10 points in the third quarter to take a 20-16 lead, but 
Fourcade hit Martin for a 20-yard TD early in the fourth quarter for a 23-20 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Then Dave Waymer intercepted Cunningham to start a 58-yard drive, capped by 
Buford Jordan's one-yard run with 6:12 left that all but clinched it. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia's turnovers started early. 
</P>
<P>
The first came when Rickey Jackson stripped the ball from Cunningham and Robert 
Massie recovered at the Philadelphia 35. Four plays later, Fourcade drilled the 
ball over the middle to Martin, who made a leaping catch at the two and fell 
over the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, Milton Mack stripped Keith Byars of the ball and Gene 
Atkins recovered at the 38. This time it took only two plays as Fourcade rolled 
right and found Hilliard, who caught the ball at the 15 and rambled in to make 
it 14-0 just 10 seconds into the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia took just five plays to come back, the big one a 60-yard pass play 
from Cunningham to Byars that carried to the New Orleans 13. On the next play, 
Cunningham, who finished completed 19 of 34 passes for 306 yards and ran for 83 
yards, hit Johnson in the right corner of the end zone to cut the deficit in 
half just 2:46 into the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles cut it to 14-10 on Roger Ruzek's 21-yard field goal with 8:20 left 
in the half. Anthony Edwards made a fair catch of a punt on his own four with 
33 seconds left in the half, and it cost Philadelphia when Warren burst threw 
and dumped Cunningham in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards redeemed himself early in the third quarter, catching a 66-yard bomb 
from Cunningham on a third-and-24 play that carried to the New Orleans one. Two 
plays later, Cunningham hit David Little at the back of the end zone for a 
touchdown that made it 17-16. 
</P>
<P>
Ruzek's 19-yard field goal with 16 seconds left in the period made it 20-16.

INVESTIGATORS SEEK WITNESSES, CLUES TO KIDNAP-MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Investigators searching for clues in the violent rape and murder of a young 
woman abducted from a Carson drive-in theater appealed Monday to witnesses for 
help in finding the men who also brutally beat the woman's boyfriend and then 
burned the couple's car. 
</P>
<P>
In Mexico on Monday, Roberto Franco, father of the slain woman, was recovering 
from a mild heart attack he suffered when he was told of the murder. Franco, 
who lives near Guadalajara, had planned to come to California next month to 
take his daughter, Irene Franco, 20, back to Mexico, friends and family said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's investigators say their search for the killers is complicated by the 
fact that there is no record of those who attended the South Bay 6 Drive-in 
Friday night, when the couple were abducted at gunpoint by three armed men. 
</P>
<P>
"We are soliciting help, not only from those who were in attendance at the 
theater, but also people who may have been in the vicinity outside the theater 
at the time, and those who may have seen the suspects drive away," said 
Sheriff's Deputy Bill Wehner. 
</P>
<P>
Friends and family of the young woman say they will take her body to Mexico for 
burial as soon as authorities complete an autopsy. The funeral could be as 
early as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A benefactor who wishes to remain anonymous has offered to pay the costs of 
transporting Franco's body to her hometown, and a mortuary in Guadalajara is 
donating the cost of the funeral, said Father Luis Valbuena of Holy Family 
Church in Wilmington, which Franco frequently attended. 
</P>
<P>
As hundreds of other movie-goers sat in their cars at the sprawling drive-in 
near the San Diego and Harbor freeways, the gunmen tied up Franco and her date, 
Jesus Martinez, 26, and drove them to an alley in an industrial area north of 
Carson. There, they severely beat Martinez and tied him with an electrical 
cord. Before the assailants drove away with Franco, they told Martinez not to 
worry, saying they would drop her off in a few minutes, Martinez told 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The following morning, Franco's body was found in a South Los Angeles field. 
She had been shot in the head. The car was found burned and abandoned near 
Watts. 
</P>
<P>
Franco's boyfriend was too distraught to talk about the incident Monday, 
according to his mother, Theresa Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
"They were both victims," she said. "He does not feel very good at all. . . . 
Whoever imagined such a thing would occur to them?" 
</P>
<P>
She said the couple had been dating about three months. Martinez lives in 
Gardena and Franco lived in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
"She did not deserve this," said Irma Plascensia, Franco's best friend. The two 
had known each other since they were schoolgirls in the town of Tepatitlan, 
just outside of Guadalajara, where Franco's father and six brothers and sisters 
still live. 
</P>
<P>
Franco's mother died when she was young, Plascensia said. 
</P>
<P>
Plascensia said her friend was a hard-working young woman with strong family 
and religious values who never stayed out past 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 months ago, Plascensia said, Franco and a younger sister came to stay 
with her and her family in Wilmington for a monthlong vacation. The sister 
returned to Mexico, but Franco stayed. 
</P>
<P>
"She loved it here," Plascensia said. "She said her future was here. She told 
me she would like to stay longer, and I said, 'This is your house."' 
</P>
<P>
Plascensia said Franco had planned to attend medical school , but learned just 
before her vacation that she had not been accepted at a school, a competitive 
process in Mexico that has more to do with the small number of medical colleges 
than with test performance. 
</P>
<P>
Franco found a job at a shoe store and the girlfriends attended evening English 
classes at a neighboring high school until a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The school is far away, and as it gets darker earlier now, we didn't want to 
attend classes last semester because we have to walk," Plascensia said. "But we 
were going to start classes again in February." 
</P>
<P>
Plascensia said she is going to Mexico to see her friend buried. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to accompany her," she said. "I am taking her to Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
Father Valbuena said it has been difficult explaining the slaying to Franco's 
family. 
</P>
<P>
"For a town like Tepatitlan, this is unheard of," he said. "To have something 
like this happen, they don't understand it. They are saying, how can you go to 
the movies and have someone attack you and kill you so brutally and then burn 
your car? They don't understand it because they don't understand how a human 
being can do such a thing." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, authorities were investigating the similarities between the murder 
and an abduction Monday in which two gunmen forced a Bassett couple out of 
their car and abducted the woman. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old woman and her husband, 34, were in their car in a park in the 
City of Industry when the men approached, ordered the husband out and drove off 
with the woman, who was released unharmed about an hour later and 12 miles away 
in San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Hal Grant said Monday's assailants "answer the same general description" 
as those in the slaying. They were believed to be driving the victims' 1988 
white Thunderbird, with California license 2HKY059.

ARSENIO HALL TELLS COURT FILM WASN'T BUCHWALD'S IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Television talk show host Arsenio Hall testified Monday that he and comedian 
Eddie Murphy, not humorist Art Buchwald, conceived the idea for the movie 
"Coming to America" in 1987, four years after Buchwald's original story idea 
was optioned by Paramount Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
In a $5-million breach-of-contract suit against the film studio, Buchwald 
alleges that he, not Murphy, came up with the story concept -- which the 
humorist entitled "King for a Day" -- that evolved into the comedy film that 
grossed $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
Portraying Murphy as a generous, sensitive and talented person, Hall maintained 
that Murphy -- Paramount's No. 1 box office attraction -- approached him in 
1987 to take the role of his sidekick in "The Quest," which eventually became 
"Coming to America." 
</P>
<P>
The movie was to be a "black fairy tale" with several different character roles 
that both he and Murphy could portray. Hall -- who hosts a syndicated talk 
show, broadcast locally on Channel 13 -- testified in the third day of trial in 
Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Hall maintained that he knew nothing about Buchwald's story, which Paramount 
optioned in 1983 for producer Alain Bernheim to develop into an Eddie Murphy 
comedy. After three scripts, and about $500,000 in development expenses, 
Paramount dropped its option with Buchwald and Bernheim in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Hall described a process whereby he and Murphy acted out scenes and ideas and 
recited them into tape recorders. They later gave the tapes to two former 
"Saturday Night Live" staff writers who had worked with Murphy and molded it 
all into the script for "Coming to America." 
</P>
<P>
The witness cited Murphy's granting of screenwriting credit to the two writers 
as a sign of Murphy's generosity. 
</P>
<P>
When Buchwald's attorney suggested that Murphy -- who took sole screen credit 
for "creating" the story for "Coming to America" -- might have an ego problem, 
Hall recounted how a recent film entitled "I'm Gonna Get You, Sucka" came from 
an Eddie Murphy idea for which Murphy never sought credit. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody will ever know that it came from Eddie's idea," Hall said. "He's a very 
generous man." 
</P>
<P>
The switch from Murphy's usual tough, foul-mouthed cop or con artist character 
-- popularized in such films as "Beverly Hills Cop" and "48 Hours" -- to the 
kindly Prince Akeem of "Coming to America" was intentionally developed, Hall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a face lift on his character," the witness said. "He was not the 
wisecracking Axel Foley character from 'Beverly Hills Cop,' " Hall said. "This 
showed him soft, sensitive, non-materialistic. He was a gentleman. In this 
movie, he was the perfect man. Any woman would love him." 
</P>
<P>
Following Hall to the stand, Paramount Pictures Corp. chairman Frank Mancuso 
steadfastly maintained during two hours of questioning that he was only 
"generally" aware that Bernheim was developing a script from Buchwald's 
treatment. He said he did not remember that it was being developed as a script 
for Murphy, despite a series of Paramount inter-office memos filed as exhibits 
in the case that show that it was so planned. 
</P>
<P>
In an uncomfortable moment for Mancuso, Buchwald's attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, 
pointed out that Paramount has renegotiated Murphy's contract four times, 
substantially boosting what the studio must pay the star each time. 
</P>
<P>
In an October interview with Murphy in Rolling Stone magazine, the actor was 
quoted as saying that he was not happy with his current five-picture contract 
with the studio. O'Donnell asked that the interview be made an exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Murphy earns $8 million a movie and 15% of the film's gross 
receipts. According to testimony, his seven Paramount releases have earned $883 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the studio is renegotiating Murphy's contract again, Mancuso likened 
the star to a good ballplayer who is a big drawing card. He added in a barely 
audible voice: "We are always in negotiations with Eddie." 
</P>
<P>
Off the witness stand, Hall issued wisecracks, signed autographs for lawyers 
and posed for pictures with bailiffs. 
</P>
<P>
Outside court, the talk show host characterized Buchwald's assertion that 
Murphy might have stolen the columnist's idea as insulting and "absurd." 
</P>
<P>
During his own turn on the stand Monday, the 64-year-old syndicated columnist 
said the genesis for his eight-page film treatment sprang from decades of 
various ideas that came to him as a columnist/writer.

LATINO GROUP OFFERS ITS DESIGN FOR DISTRICTING; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: A COUNTERPROPOSAL LEAVES LITTLE FOR SCHABARUM. THE KEY QUESTION 
EMERGES: WILL DANA GO FOR IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund has made the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors a counteroffer in efforts to settle a 
federal voting rights lawsuit, proposing to carve up the San Gabriel Valley 
among three supervisors and create a new 1st District in which a Latino has a 
chance of being elected. 
</P>
<P>
The offer was made in response to a settlement proposal offered by the county 
board last week that also makes Supervisor Pete Schabarum bear the brunt of 
redistricting by forcing him to face reelection in the predominantly Latino 1st 
District. 
</P>
<P>
The latest map, endorsed by the Justice Department and the American Civil 
Liberties Union, which joined MALDEF in the lawsuit, would make a Schabarum 
reelection bid even more difficult, as Latinos account for 70% of the 
population in the district and 47.4% of the registered voters. Registered 
Republicans, in what was once a solid conservative district, would drop to 
25.9% of voters. 
</P>
<P>
Under the county's proposal, the district would have been 63% Latino by 
population, 36.5% Latino by voter registration and 34.2% Republican. Many 
observers, including Latino politicians interested in the seat, said that under 
the county's proposal it would be possible for Schabarum to hold on to the 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
But the counterproposal adds high Latino voter registration areas of Pico 
Rivera and Montebello to the proposed 1st District and cuts out solid Schabarum 
conservative areas of Covina and Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
MALDEF officials could not be reached Monday for comment on the proposal. The 
organization has said that it will also file a plan for drawing district lines 
as part of a proposal to expand the board to seven members. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the drastic changes to Schabarum's 1st District, the proposed 
redistricting also would herald big changes for Supervisor Deane Dana, who 
broke ranks with his fellow conservative supervisors and joined two liberals in 
voting to begin settlement negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Dana's 4th District now runs along the coast from Malibu to Long Beach and then 
juts inland to Paramount and Bellflower. Under the latest proposal, it would 
continue along like a skinny finger up into the San Gabriel Valley -- taking in 
Whittier, La Habra Heights, Diamond Bar, Walnut and Covina. 
</P>
<P>
Many Republican politicians in these areas have close ties to Schabarum, and 
they have answered his call to urge Dana to reverse his position and withdraw 
from settlement talks. 
</P>
<P>
But Dana would also benefit under the MALDEF proposal, which takes out of his 
district Santa Monica and Malibu, two high Democratic voter registration areas 
where he has had problems over issues concerning development. 
</P>
<P>
Dana, through a spokesman, would say only, "We will confer with the attorneys 
and see where we stand." But some observers speculated that the possibility of 
a settlement could evaporate if Dana is not satisfied with the plan. If he 
changes his vote, and joins conservatives Schabarum and Mike Antonovich, the 
case would go to trial on Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the big question," said political consultant Allan Hoffenblum. "Will 
Dana buy it?" 
</P>
<P>
Under the MALDEF proposal Supervisor Kenneth Hahn would remain in a solid 
central Los Angeles Democratic district. Antonovich, while shifting eastward to 
take in the foothill region of the San Gabriel Valley, would still have a 
solidly Republican district. 
</P>
<P>
Liberal Supervisor Ed Edelman would see his district expand to include heavily 
Democratic areas in Malibu and Santa Monica, and parts of the West San Fernando 
Valley, where his environmentalist views are popular. 
</P>
<P>
As the various maps are proposed and debated in the secret negotiations, San 
Gabriel Valley communities are up in arms over the proposals, contending there 
should be public comment on the redistricting plans that threaten to 
drastically change the political representation of hundreds of thousands of 
county residents. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum has promised to "pack" today's board meeting in an attempt to force 
Dana to drop out of settlement talks. Many local Republican politicians have 
written letters of support to Schabarum and missives of disapproval to Dana. 
</P>
<P>
Dana, often seen as the quiet, soft-spoken member of the board, emerged in 
recent weeks as the political force behind the settlement talks. Dana has said 
his motivation for negotiating a settlement is that it would be better for the 
supervisors to draw the new district lines than to have a map imposed on them 
if they should lose the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
And in drawing the lines in his own favor, Dana said, "I wasn't going to shoot 
myself in the foot." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit accuses supervisors of breaking up the Latino neighborhoods among 
three districts, thereby weakening the political clout of many of the county's 
2 millions Latinos in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Maldef Redistricting Proposal 
</P>
<P>
The map below has been proposed by the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund as a way redraw county board of supervisors districts to 
concentrate Latino voters in a single district and settle a federal lawsuit the 
organization brought against the county under the federal Voting Rights Act. 
The proposal is a counter offer to a map submitted by the county last week. It 
adds Latino areas in Pico Rivera and Montebello to the 1st District and cuts 
out Whittier, Walnut and Covina.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ATLANTIC RICHFIELD PLEADS NO CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Atlantic Richfield Co. has pleaded no contest to charges that it released 
heavy black smoke from its Carson refinery and was fined $22,500. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge Carlos Marino last week also sentenced the company to one 
year's probation. The company was ordered to repair the equipment that caused 
the smoke emission as a condition of probation. The sentence was imposed after 
the company pleaded no contest to two misdemeanor violations of the health and 
safety code for unlawfully discharging air contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. William Carter said the emissions were released last May 29 
from a coke heater and a tail gas incinerator at a refinery at 1801 E. 
Sepulveda Blvd.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-RECORD PROMOTER GETS PROBATION IN PAYOLA 
CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. District Court Judge William J. Rea on Monday sentenced William Craig, a 
former independent record promoter, to five years' probation and 100 hours of 
community service and fined him $60,000 after his conviction on payola and tax 
evasion charges. 
</P>
<P>
Craig, 44, of Scottsdale, Ariz., was one of four people indicted on payola 
charges by a Los Angeles federal grand jury in February, 1988. At time of the 
indictment, then-U.S. Atty. Robert C. Bonner called it the nation's most 
significant payola case since the early 1970s. Craig, who pleaded guilty in 
October, had faced up to three years in prison for one count of failing to 
disclose payola payments and two counts of assisting in preparation of a false 
income tax return. But the prosecutor did not urge that he be imprisoned. 
Another defendant, Ralph Tashjian of San Mateo, was sentenced earlier this 
month to five years' probation and 500 hours of community service and was fined 
$100,000.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 4 CREW MEMBERS RESCUED AS FISHING BOAT SINKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All four crew members of a fishing boat based in San Pedro were safely 
evacuated by the Coast Guard early Monday as their 42-foot purse seiner, laden 
with nets and a catch of squid, sank off the coast of Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
The Donna K, a 37-year-old wooden-hulled boat, began taking on water at 3:30 
a.m. and went down at 5:38 a.m. after the Coast Guard determined that it could 
not be saved, according to Chief Petty Officer Marc Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no real danger (to the crew)," Phillips said. "We were alongside 
attempting to refloat it. When it looked like we were going to lose it, we took 
them off." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips said authorities have not determined the cause of the flooding. The 
operator of the boat, Pete LoGrande, 34, of San Pedro, could not be reached.

ELDERLY MINISTER HIT, KILLED AFTER WALKING INTO FAST LANE OF FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARISSE JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 84-year-old minister, who neighbors say was easily disoriented because of 
his age, was killed Monday when he walked into the fast lane of the Santa Ana 
Freeway and was struck by an oncoming vehicle, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Horace Moore of Southwest Los Angeles died of multiple traumatic injuries after 
walking into the southbound traffic lanes, according to officials of the county 
coroner's office and the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Moore was in the fast lane, apparently trying to cross the freeway just south 
of Greenwood Avenue, when he was struck, CHP Officer Sandra Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the vehicle, 20-year-old Kenneth Noyons, was not cited, according 
to officials. 
</P>
<P>
While investigators tried to figure out why and how Moore wound up on the 
freeway, residents of the neighborhood where Moore lived said that the elderly 
minister -- pastor of Christ Community Truth Church in Los Angeles -- often had 
become lost or disoriented during the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
"He would just get lost. That's why he didn't drive anymore," recalled Alma 
Lockhart, who lived across the street from Moore and his wife, Thelma. "He 
drove out towards Riverside and Moreno Valley, and the police would have to 
bring him back home." 
</P>
<P>
Moore's memory lapses sometimes got so bad that he would get confused and "miss 
his driveway," Lockhart continued. "He'd turn into any driveway he could find, 
and then he'd back up and find his own place." 
</P>
<P>
Moore had been pastor of the church, now located on Normandie Avenue, for more 
than 50 years. Members of the congregation had recently begun to pick up Moore 
and his wife to take them to service, Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
"She took the keys away," said Lockhart, referring to Moore's wife, who walks 
with crutches because of a bone ailment. "The last few months she was having to 
take care of him and herself. Before that, he did a lot for her." 
</P>
<P>
Thelma Moore, in a brief interview, said her husband did not have Alzheimer's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
"He was (just) losing his memory as people tend to do when they get older." She 
declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said she had heard that Horace Moore was visiting another church the 
night he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me that he had gone up to put money in the collection plate, and he 
just kept on out the front door," she said. "They kept waiting for him to come 
back. And he never did."

NIECE AND BOYFRIEND ARRESTED IN SLAYING OF BLIND WOMAN, 75 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARRELL DAWSEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 25-year-old Los Angeles woman and her boyfriend have been arrested for 
allegedly bludgeoning and fatally stabbing the woman's blind great-aunt and 
pawning the victim's diamond ring for cocaine money, Los Angeles police said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Daphne Brownlee and Gregory McClain Jenkins, 34, also of Los Angeles, were 
arrested about 2 a.m. Saturday in the slaying of Helen Duvalle, 75, who was 
robbed and killed in her Southwest Los Angeles apartment sometime before dawn 
Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the two, who were booked on suspicion of first-degree murder, were 
expected to be charged and arraigned today. Both are being held without bail, 
Jenkins at Parker Center and Brownlee at Sybil Brand Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Duvalle, blind for 30 years, was stabbed several times and bludgeoned in her 
apartment on South Brighton Street, Detective Larry Kallestad said. She was 
found by a delivery man the next day. Her two-karat diamond ring was missing, 
Kallestad said. 
</P>
<P>
Brownlee and Jenkins were taken into custody after detectives interviewed 
Brownlee about the slaying, Kallestad said. 
</P>
<P>
"After blatant inconsistencies in her story came to light, she was 
reinterviewed and arrested," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Brownlee recounted her story, Kallestad said, police picked up Jenkins, 
who was also later arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Kallestad said the suspects led police to a pawn shop and Duvalle's ring. 
</P>
<P>
"They had pawned it for $40," the detective said. "They used the money to buy 
cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
Two days after the arrests, shock still lingered in the Brownlee household. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all just devastated by it all," said Ninotchka Brownlee, 47, Daphne's 
mother. "She was very close to Aunt Cookie (Duvalle's nickname). 
</P>
<P>
"(Daphne) did a lot for her. So did Gregory." 
</P>
<P>
When Daphne Brownlee dissolved into heavy sobs and shivers last week, her 
mother interpreted her lament as a natural reaction to the stabbing death of 
her great-aunt. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew she loved (Duvalle)," the mother said in an interview Monday. "We 
thought she was just crying out of grief." 
</P>
<P>
Not long after Duvalle's death, Daphne Brownlee was quick to express love for 
her aunt. 
</P>
<P>
"We all loved Aunt Cookie," she told a reporter last week. "She was always very 
independent, but we used to try to do things for her anyway. She was just so 
sweet." 
</P>
<P>
Although Ninotchka Brownlee said she was certain that her daughter loved 
Duvalle, police maintain that the lure of drugs may have prompted Daphne to 
kill her. 
</P>
<P>
Brownlee said her daughter had suffered drug problems years ago, but she 
believed that the woman had vanquished them. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to put her in detox three years ago," said Ninotchka Brownlee, who is 
suffering from cancer. "But we figured she had changed when she came back home 
to help me out." 
</P>
<P>
The elder Brownlee said her daughter had moved in with Jenkins not long after 
the couple met two years ago at a hospital where Daphne Brownlee worked. 
</P>
<P>
Other family members said Jenkins was not welcomed into the house, but he was 
tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say he was a nice guy," said Violet Bowen, Daphne's grandmother. 
"But he did make himself available to us because he was my granddaughter's 
boyfriend." 
</P>
<P>
After the slaying, relatives said they strongly believed that Duvalle was 
killed by an acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
"It had to be somebody she knew because her dogs didn't bark," Bowen said. 
"They usually would have been making a lot of noise." 
</P>
<P>
Duvalle kept two dogs -- a cocker spaniel named Lady and a Yorkshire terrier 
named Toby -- which suffered shock and had to be destroyed after the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Ninotchka Brownlee said her daughter broke into tears as the family discussed 
Duvalle's death. 
</P>
<P>
"She just freaked out," the woman's mother said. "She started crying and 
shaking. She said she never thought her life would be like this. I just didn't 
know what she meant." 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, the young woman and her boyfriend were arrested and booked in 
Duvalle's murder. 
</P>
<P>
"We just went limp," Bowen said. "We couldn't do anything. Our house wouldn't 
even heat up. It was like evil forces were here."

CIVIL RIGHTS SUIT ACCUSING POLICE DEPT. OF BRUTALITY SETTLED BY TORRANCE FOR 
$105,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six men who accused the Torrance Police Department of brutality in a highly 
publicized case have accepted $105,000 to drop a federal civil rights lawsuit 
filed last year, when the men released a videotape showing one of them being 
choked and beaten into unconsciousness. 
</P>
<P>
The six friends filed suit in September, 1988, seeking more than $3 million in 
damages. They claimed that they had been beaten four months earlier by Torrance 
police who broke up an unruly party they were attending. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance City Council voted Dec. 5 to settle the case. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Hugh Manes said the men -- Clifford S. Shirk Jr. and Thomas Tice of 
Torrance; Eric Musick, Redondo Beach; Gerald Lockstadt, Downey; Darrick Tucker, 
Inglewood, and Steve Warner, Venice -- consider the settlement a victory. 
</P>
<P>
They wanted to avoid a lengthy trial and did not expect to win a substantial 
judgment because none of the men sustained severe injuries, Manes said. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney said the six plaintiffs believed that they did not need to prove 
wrongdoing within the Torrance Police Department after a $6-million civil 
verdict in September against the department and seven of its employees in an 
unrelated case. That judgment went to a San Pedro man whose son was killed in a 
collision with an off-duty Torrance police sergeant. A jury found that the 
Torrance Police Department had a "pattern and practice" of condoning police 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a very compelling factor in their decision," Manes said. "They never 
would have settled this case, if it hadn't been shown they had such a policy." 
</P>
<P>
Torrance City Atty. Ken Nelson said the police officers did nothing wrong in 
breaking up the party and added that the city settled to avoid the substantial 
attorneys' fees in defending the case. 
</P>
<P>
The six friends drew substantial publicity last year when they released a 
videotape of police arresting Tice, 20. The tape showed Officer James Lynch 
holding Tice in a chokehold, while Officer Ross Bartlett hit him eight times 
with a nightstick. The officers continued to choke and hit Tice after his body 
went limp, the videotape showed. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department and City Hall received hundreds of phone calls and 
letters of protest after the videotape was broadcast on nationwide television.

A WHOLE COMMUNITY FACES A LIFE SENTENCE OF NEGLECT; 
</P>
<P>
WAR ON DRUGS: DRACONIAN PUNISHMENT ONLY INCREASES THE SUFFERING OF AFRICAN 
AMERICANS WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE CAUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HALFORD H. FAIRCHILD, Halford H. Fairchild, a social psychologist, teaches 
in the Pan African Studies Department at Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 22-year-old African American man was sentenced early this month in Los 
Angeles to life in prison without the possibility of parole for distributing 
crack cocaine. It was California's first implementation of President Bush's 
war-on-drugs policy. 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing illustrates misguided policy and, in fact, contributes to the 
ravaging of the African American community and our society through poverty, 
drugs, crime and a host of related maladies. 
</P>
<P>
Incarcerating drug dealers distracts us from the true causes of drug abuse and 
crime. To the extent that we are so distracted, the underlying causes of these 
problems remain untreated, and we can expect the continued proliferation of 
drugs and related crime. 
</P>
<P>
More important, the war-on-drugs mentality is a metaphor for our approach to 
social problems in general: Those who display pathological symptoms are treated 
as the cause of those symptoms and then prescribed "appropriate" treatment. We 
therefore ignore the socioeconomic realities that produce these pathologies. 
</P>
<P>
Crack cocaine and other drugs of devastation are equal-opportunity toxins: They 
permeate every ethnic group and socioeconomic stratum. But drug abuse and other 
social poisons hit hardest at the more vulnerable segments of our society: the 
racially isolated, unemployed, chronically impoverished and socially 
disfranchised. 
</P>
<P>
It is no surprise, then, that drug abuse and related criminal activity are 
problems on a larger scale in the poor, ethnic- minority inner cities. This 
fact provides a clue to the causes of these problems. 
</P>
<P>
If we can understand the cause of social isolation, of chronic and 
intergenerational poverty and of anomie and despair, then we can understand the 
causes of drug abuse and related crime. And if this is true, then one thing is 
clear: That 22-year-old African American man facing a lifetime in prison is not 
the cause of segregation, poverty or social distance. His incarceration is not 
the cure. 
</P>
<P>
The causes of poverty include unemployment and underemployment. The causes of 
unemployment are tied to the training of the work force and the availability of 
jobs. Inner-city schools are marked by overcrowding, underfunding, 
less-experienced teachers and academic failure. In some areas, the drop-out 
rate for junior high school is nearly 25%. In many areas, the drop-out rate for 
high school exceeds 50%. Without the necessary academic skills of reading, 
writing and computation, the people living in inner cities are 
disproportionately ill-equipped to compete in a highly technological workplace. 
Moreover, the presumption of incompetence results in continuing racial 
discrimination in employment. 
</P>
<P>
Capital-intensive fiscal priorities, particularly within the military arena, 
serve to eliminate jobs in favor of hardware for death and destruction. We 
marvel at the technological sophistication of the B-2 Stealth bomber, but how 
many jobs can such a weapon produce relative to more humane endeavors? How many 
of these jobs can serve the employment needs of African American men? 
</P>
<P>
The welfare system ensures that millions of Americans live in unremitting 
poverty. This economic parachute opens only for the desperately poor, and 
scarcely softens the fall from catastrophe to subsistance. 
</P>
<P>
Drugs are the narcotic that eases the pain from this hardship. Funding drug 
addiction requires illicit activity that preys on other residents of the 
already economically impoverished community. 
</P>
<P>
To end the cycle of drug addiction and related crime -- and the victimization 
of people in our inner cities -- requires ending the underlying causes. We must 
focus on improving access to quality education in the inner cities. We must 
guarantee equal attainment of basic academic skills. We must increase access to 
jobs and careers. We must eliminate employment discrimination. We must move 
beyond mere equal opportunity to equal achievement in health, education and 
general well-being. We must eliminate the motive for narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, current government emphasis is on building jails and prisons; the 
current construction program is the biggest in our history. And with a prison 
population that is nearly 50% African American, the new cells promise the 
continued removal of these men from the community and from positive economic 
contributions to their families. 
</P>
<P>
Misguided policy interventions, such as incarceration for life, actually 
contribute to the perpetuation of the very problems they seek to ameliorate. A 
22-year-old spending life in prison will have little chance to be a productive 
member of his family, and no chance at all to be productive in his community. 
Both will go on, vulnerable to the unrelenting devastation of drugs and crime, 
while society at-large assumes the burden of housing him for the next 50 years 
or so.

A COKE RUNNER WITH A CONSCIENCE

The Last Run by Kay Wolff and Sybil Taylor; (Viking: $18.95; 344 pages). 
</P>
<P>
As Colombia continues to be ravaged by its full-fledged cocaine war, it is 
interesting to recall trafficking's somewhat humbler days. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, cocaine still was considered a non-addictive drug in the 
United States. In Colombia, the magic powder was just another product in the 
time-honored business of contraband. 
</P>
<P>
Today, of course, $1 million is pocket change to big-time traffickers, but in 
1969, it was considered a respectable income for Colombian cocaine producers 
like Roberto Alvarez. His family processed 100 kilos a month, ran a furniture 
factory to conceal the drug for shipment, and managed a stable of 20 "mules" to 
hand-carry cocaine to Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Last Run," Kay Wolff and Sybil Taylor write of an American woman's 
outlaw days as one of Alvarez's mules and suitcase makers in his clandestine 
factory. Kayleen Wolff (a pseudonym) is a do-good drug dealer, a cocaine addict 
with a social conscience. She is the striking daughter of Okie immigrants to 
the San Joaquin Valley who learned to drive a forklift and went on to earn a 
master's in fine arts from UCLA. At 27, Kay made her way to Bogota in search of 
adventure and riches and, according to the book, she found both. 
</P>
<P>
In a little more than a year, she suffers an earthquake and a plane crash, 
becomes addicted to cocaine and kicks the habit, and is forced to kill an 
intruder into her Bogota apartment. She cannot bear the sight of street waifs 
begging for money and finally adopts two of them just before a meeting of the 
Alvarez family in which the "godfather" shoots his own brother-in-law, 
splattering his brains all over Kay's arm and dress. When she screams and 
attempts to flee, he breaks her ribs. 
</P>
<P>
True? Maybe, maybe not. Maybe there is a little embellishment here and there, 
but evidently there is some truth, too. The writing is uneven -- sometimes 
flowing, sometimes stilted -- but Kay's story gives us a rare glimpse inside a 
Colombian drug family just as the cocaine business is taking off. 
</P>
<P>
Kay's entree into the Alvarez family is through Roberto's son, Ricardo, a 
"younger man" of 19 or 20 whom she meets at a party and teaches to make love 
before buying a kilo of his pure cocaine. Kay turns the stash over to her 
friend and apparently sometime-lover, Maggie, her business partner who carries 
the cocaine to Los Angeles in a false-bottom suitcase. 
</P>
<P>
When Ricardo discovers Kay's skill in fabricating suitcases to conceal cocaine, 
he brings her to a lunch with Dad. She is accepted quickly into the Alvarez 
family and factory. (Too quickly? She is privy to an awful lot of information.) 
She moves into an apartment in one of Alvarez's buildings and occasionally is 
asked to escort his mistress about town. A gringa among Latins, she is treated 
as something more than a woman but not quite a man. 
</P>
<P>
Soon she is earning $10,000 a month from Alvarez, plus she and 
</P>
<P>
Maggie are claiming $50,000 with each run of their own. She also has a habit of 
two or three grams of pure coke a day. 
</P>
<P>
The book describes techniques of smuggling -- in padded bras, radio batteries 
and high-heeled shoes -- that wouldn't become known to U.S. Customs agents 
until the mid-'70s but which are virtually obsolete today. Even then, Alvarez 
was beginning to think big with boats. 
</P>
<P>
Kay describes her delicate work on suitcases and furniture with her tool kit of 
C-clamps, needle-nose pliers, pinking shears, matte knives and casing glue. For 
the Alvarez family, she also carried cocaine to Europe -- via Brazil to 
Portugal -- and banked in the Cayman Islands, always in disguise, with fake 
passport and travel papers. 
</P>
<P>
Half the smuggling business, she says, is waiting, and coping with your nerves 
while you wait. The other half seems to be the high of success, what she calls 
the terror of risk mixed with the elation of victory. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the thrill, however, Kay's '60s conscience bothers her. She hates the 
way the Alvarez family treats its servants, and the rat-packs of hungry 
children in the streets eat away at her. She gives them candy and coins and, as 
Ricardo is about to drop her for his family-picked bride, she brings two girls 
home. Her love for the street kids gives her the strength she needs to kick her 
cocaine habit. And when the godfather grows violent, she knows it's time to go 
home. 
</P>
<P>
The "last run" is Kay's trip home smuggling her two adopted children through 
Costa Rica, Guatemala and Mexico into the United States. It is a touching part 
of the book. 
</P>
<P>
Drug Enforcement Agency sources say they have never heard of Roberto Alvarez. 
In the epilogue of the book, Kay concedes that his name never appears among the 
famous drug lords written up in newspapers. She concludes that he must be dead. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, she says she has lived in fear for the last 20 years, always 
recalling the advice she received from an Alvarez: "The world is a small place 
when a Colombian is looking for you."

VISION FROM INSIDE THE PRISON OF SOCIETY'S TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dangerous Diagnostics: The Social Power of Biological Information by Dorothy 
Nelkin and Laurence Tancredi (Basic Books: $18.95; 207 pages) 
</P>
<P>
One of the most compelling and unnerving depictions of contemporary life was 
written by the French philosopher Michel Foucault, who described social 
institutions as prisons where everyone is watched, recorded, disciplined and 
forced to conform. 
</P>
<P>
Foucault's vision is more insidious and more frightening than George Orwell's 
"Big Brother is watching you." For Foucault, there is no Big Brother. Everyone 
is watching everyone else. There is no "bad guy" that you can point to as the 
cause of the trouble -- or that you can revolt against. It is the system 
itself, in the name of efficiency, that makes prisoners of us all. 
</P>
<P>
In "Discipline and Punish" (1977), Foucault described how hospitals, schools 
and workplaces have become places of control, where knowledge literally is 
power. The price we pay for an efficient economic machine is very high. We 
sacrifice much of ourselves to the machine. 
</P>
<P>
Now come Dorothy Nelkin and Laurence Tancredi to paint a very Foucaultian 
picture of the growth and dangers of medical testing in hospitals, schools and 
workplaces, a vision that once again pits the needs of society against the 
rights of individuals. 
</P>
<P>
In the name of efficiency -- always in the name of efficiency -- we are 
blithely accepting the arguments of insurance companies, employers, health-care 
providers and courts, and unthinkingly allowing ourselves to be tested and 
controlled. 
</P>
<P>
In "Dangerous Diagnostics," an important book that deserves wide attention, 
Nelkin and Tancredi describe the coming use of a wide variety of 
less-than-reliable medical tests -- including genetic screening and psychiatric 
evaluation -- and the coercive and subtle threats that accompany them. 
</P>
<P>
"While biological tests enhance institutional control, they can also conflict 
with social considerations of civil liberties, human integrity or personal 
privacy," the authors write. 
</P>
<P>
"They can bear on people's economic interests, the cost of their insurance, 
their access to jobs and educational opportunities. They can affect personal 
well-being, how people are labeled, their self-conceptions, their exercise of 
free will. They can influence social relationships, leading to stigmatization 
and discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
Nelkin and Tancredi seek to launch an informed discussion about what is 
occurring in the hope that stringent limits will be placed on the use of 
biological tests. 
</P>
<P>
The debate in the last few years over AIDS testing (and the potential social, 
psychological and economic devastation that may come to someone who tests 
positive) is a harbinger of much more testing yet to come, the authors say. 
</P>
<P>
As insurance companies seek to insure only healthy people, and as employers 
shun applicants who may become ill, "we risk increasing the number of people 
defined as unemployable, uneducable or uninsurable," they write. "We risk 
creating a biologic underclass." 
</P>
<P>
These results can occur even though an individual has no sign of a particular 
disease and, in fact, may never get it. The individual just tested positive for 
the tendency or for the genetic defect that is linked to its occurrence. "Tests 
that identify genetic traits are intrinsically incapable of accounting for the 
other variables -- diet, life style, the effect of environmental or social 
interactions -- that may influence their manifestation in disease," the authors 
write. 
</P>
<P>
In the area of psychological testing, much uncertainty and lack of knowledge is 
being swept under the rug in the interest of objective tests and conformity. 
"The boundaries of the 'normal' or the 'healthy' are often fuzzy," they say. 
"At what point, for example, should a person with borderline behavior be 
labeled learning-disabled or mentally ill?" 
</P>
<P>
Nelkin, who is a sociologist and science writer, and Tancredi, a professor of 
medicine and law, write in measured tones, but the dangers they write about are 
real and threatening. Drug testing in the workplace has received much attention 
in recent years, but it is just the tip of the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
We are on the verge of turning over much of our individual privacy and 
well-being to batteries of tests that may or may not be accurate and may or may 
not be useful. Even if they turn out to be 100% accurate -- which they are far 
from being -- all of the dangers to individuals need to be weighed against the 
claimed benefits to society. 
</P>
<P>
"Guided by the assumption that conformity will enhance efficiency and further 
their primary goals, schools, law-enforcement agencies, employers, health-care 
providers, and third-party payers use testing as a means of social control," 
Nelkin and Tancredi warn. 
</P>
<P>
Foucault asked, "Is it surprising that prisons resemble factories, schools, 
barracks, hospitals, which all resemble prisons?"

BEYOND FREEDOM, CAPTIVITY AWAITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Sacred Night by Tahar Ben Jelloun, a novel translated by Alan Sheridan (A 
Helen and Kurt Wolff Book/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich: $18.95; 192 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is closer to the shadow than to the tree that casts the shadow," 
says the blind Consul to the heroine of "The Sacred Night," Zahra, who has 
spent the first 20 years of her life as a man "married" to the wretched Fatima, 
daughter of her vicious and avaricious uncle. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, a tyrannical patriarch, has reared her as a son to boost his ego 
and foster his pride, as well as to have a "male" heir and thus prevent his 
property from falling into the hands of his brother and his wife, both of whom 
he loathes as much as he does his wife and seven other daughters. 
</P>
<P>
On his deathbed, however, the father releases Zahra from the bondage of her 
false gender. Hoping to escape from her uncle and aunt, the envy of her sisters 
and the madness of her mother and her "wife," Zahra runs away from home after 
burying all relics of her fake and hollow past in her father's grave. 
</P>
<P>
Zahra's journey takes her through dreams and visions, illusions and 
hallucinations, time and timelessness; it is a journey that ends in an arrival 
that is also, in a sense, an endlessness. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way Zahra encounters a strange young man with a veiled face who 
carries her away on horseback, a village populated only by children who never 
grow old, a faceless man with a soft voice who rapes her, ghosts in a public 
bath, a large "Seated Woman" and her blind brother who suckles at his sister's 
massive breasts and visits whores in a brothel to ease his agony. 
</P>
<P>
It is with these two, the brother and the sister, that Zahra's destiny lies, 
and it is there that her brief flight to freedom leads to a captivity from 
which there is no escape, for it is the captivity of love and sexuality. 
Zahra's story does not end here. Another prison awaits her, this time a real 
one, made of bricks and bars, tangible and definite, and therefore more easy to 
cope with. Shutting out light and time helps; self-inflicted blindness helps 
even more. 
</P>
<P>
Set in a Morocco of allegory and surreal imagination, "The Sacred Night" reads 
like an extended poem and is rich with images and metaphors that are at once 
tender and fragile yet heavy and portentous, illusive yet rock-solid and real. 
Ben Jelloun and his characters have their feet firmly planted in this world, 
but their hearts and their minds are in many different worlds and times that 
occasionally converge only to drift apart again. 
</P>
<P>
There is an almost never-ending stock of ancient wisdom in and between the 
words of this book, which is so strongly in the Eastern school of Sufi 
mysticism that I am not sure how much of it readers in the West will be able to 
appreciate or even accept. I found it bold and amusing, tragic and funny, 
ironic and twisted, yet somehow eerily straightforward. And very moving. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sacred Night," which won France's Prix Goncourt after being published in 
French in 1987, also takes a new and mystifying look at Islam, a much more 
complicated and multifaceted faith than recent events, both literary and 
political, may have led some of its critics and observers to surmise. But in 
the end it is the characters -- their hopes, aspirations, weaknesses, strengths 
-- and the land -- its dust and sand, houses and one-person lanes, culture and 
way of life -- that dominate the book and mesmerize the reader. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligence, the author believes, is the failure to comprehend the world; 
appearance the most perverse mask; clarity a delusion; truth the voice more 
than the words spoken. Ben Jelloun's voice has the loud and clear ring of 
truth, despite some weak notes, avoidable repetitions and odd, inappropriate 
words (the blame for which most likely rests with the translator) in an 
otherwise delicately crafted rape scene. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it is the rape that more than anything else brings out the great 
divide between the perception of the world as seen by the Western, Christian 
civilization and as experienced by Zahra, the daughter of the East. 
</P>
<P>
"There was blood on my fingers and between my legs," Zahra comments, "but I 
felt neither dirtied nor sullied. I got dressed and went on my way. Something 
echoed in my head, the sound of a hammer on stone, or a piece of marble. It was 
the memory of the man's heartbeat." And later: "The encounter in the wood had 
been brutal and blind. There was no feeling or judgment in the memory. It was 
one adventure among so many others I had had." 
</P>
<P>
It is the unspoken cruelty of her uncle and the emotional violence of the 
Seated Woman that really frighten and ultimately humiliate and destroy her. 
</P>
<P>
To the discerning reader, this book will provide more than just another 
adventure among many. A lot more. But then again, I speak as a true son of the 
East.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: FANTASY CURBS, DISPLACES RAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I often have problems in relationships because of my short 
fuse. I get angry, have an outburst of rage and say things I regret. As a 
result, the person walks out, never to return, and most of the time, I suffer 
from loneliness. My sister tells me that she has the same kind of temper but 
when she's angry she works through it in her imagination. Is this crazy? -- 
G.U. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR G.U.: I don't think so. It's not a bad idea to fantasize about what you 
would do if you could, and then let it go. Some people have told me that when 
someone cuts them off in traffic or is otherwise rude and unfriendly, they 
fantasize whipping out their make-believe revolver and shooting out the 
person's tires. This harmless dream relieves their rage. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ned Marcus, a psychiatrist, points out that dreams are a way of releasing 
suppressed anger. Freud believed that dreams are a safety valve through which 
our mean, dark, horrid impulses could escape harmlessly. 
</P>
<P>
Fantasies never hurt anybody. You are allowed to dream about or think of almost 
anything you wish, and unless you act upon the dream, there's no reason to feel 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Once you learn to handle your anger, you'll probably find that you are less 
lonely and that your relationships are vastly improved. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: Should a 6-year-old be severely punished for lying? My 
husband believes they should be, and recently, when our son reported that his 
teachers complimented him and told him how good he was at a given task, we 
discovered that he'd lied. Indeed, he had not done the task properly and far 
from being complimented, he had been kept after class because of his disruptive 
behavior. -- M.P. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR M.P.: I don't believe in "severe" punishment for a 6-year-old and 
certainly not for lying. What is important for parents and teachers to explore 
is why the youngster felt it necessary to lie. I suspect he may be developing a 
habit of lying because of his fear of punishment. 
</P>
<P>
When a 6-year-old lies, intelligent understanding is needed. It's fairly 
obvious that your son wants his teachers to compliment him, to tell him what a 
good boy he is and to reassure him that he's worthwhile and capable of doing 
the tasks required. Most children want desperately to please parents and 
teachers. They like and need praise. 
</P>
<P>
If the only time a child gets the attention of his parents is when he 
misbehaves, then he may deliberately do naughty things in order to draw 
attention to himself. 
</P>
<P>
Why not try to arrange a conference with your son's teacher to try to find out 
what she feels your son needs? When a child consistently lies about his 
performance at school, he may need some professional counseling. This may be a 
cry for help.

MORNING REPORT: WEEKEND BOX OFFICE

Warner Bros.' holiday spoof "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" grossed 
$7.2 to edge out 20th Century Fox's black comedy "The War of the Roses" ($7 
million) on a cold holiday weekend -- down in business about 25% from the 
weekend before -- that found more people shopping or staying home than seeing 
movies. Most affected by the box-office freeze-out were three male-oriented 
studio films with all-star casts. Tri-Star's comedy caper "Family Business" 
(No. 6), starring Sean Connery, Dustin Hoffman and Matthew Broderick, opened on 
1,201 screens with $2.1 million; buddy-buddies Robert De Niro and Sean Penn, 
two ex-cons disguised as priests in Paramount's "We're No Angels" (No. 8), did 
$2 million on 1,239 screens, and superstar Paul Newman pulled in only $1.7 
million as Louisiana Gov. Earl K. Long in Touchstone's "Blaze" (No. 9). Each of 
the three films averaged less than $2,000 per screen. 
</P>
<P>
* Of the three critically acclaimed studio films that opened in limited release 
on Wednesday and performed well over the weekend, Tri-Star's Civil War epic 
"Glory," starring Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington and Matthew Broderick, 
finished slightly ahead of Fox's love saga "Enemies, A Love Story" and Warner 
Bros.' character drama "Driving Miss Daisy." "Glory" grossed $63,661 on three 
screens for a per-screen average of $21,220.

ALUMNI HELP YOUTH SYMPHONY MARK ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After 25 years together Mehli Mehta and the American Youth Symphony offer few 
surprises. Their concerts are predictably well-played and enthusiastically 
delivered and much more than your average rehashing of symphonic masterpieces. 
The Sunday night concert in Royce Hall, UCLA, part of the orchestra's 
anniversary celebrations, was no exception, with highly accomplished, vital 
readings of familiar music before a large and appreciative audience. 
</P>
<P>
While one must be impressed by the orchestra's continued high technical 
standard, it is Mehta's interpretations that lend these concerts more than 
passing interest. Sunday he conducted the entire concert from memory, and all 
of the music flowed with the naturalness and authority of his long association 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's big symphonic work was Cesar Franck's Symphony in D minor. In his 
own program notes, Mehta revealed his strong identification with this music, 
and his performance bore this out. He gave its fervent, mystical language full 
sway, with unforced but dramatic pacing and lavish phrasing. He brought out its 
rich colorings by enforcing clear textures and subtle dynamic shadings. 
Climaxes were massive and momentous. The orchestra played with exuberance and 
conviction, and if the brass proved overenthusiastic on occasion, they erred on 
the side of intensity. 
</P>
<P>
The first half of the program presented two AYS alumni and a current member as 
soloists. Harpist Marcia Dickstein confidently took on the solo duties for 
Ravel's Introduction and Allegro. Her technical ease and sure sense of line 
gave clear direction to the music, while Mehta and his players were elegant 
though urgent in support. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-concertmaster David Stenske, now a free-lance musician, and ex-principal 
violist Richard Elegino, now with the L.A. Philharmonic, were featured in 
Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante, K. 364. They proved directly communicative, 
unfussy soloists, particularly effective in their warm, singing account of the 
Andante. Mehta and orchestra gave the accompaniment a joyous reading with 
bright accents and emphatic outlines.TIMOTHY MANGAN

'BLACK FOLK IN SONG' AT WESTWOOD PLAYHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Black Folk in Song," at the Westwood Playhouse, is half historical pageant, 
half gospel revue. The parts don't fit well together. 
</P>
<P>
There are strong voices in the cast, and occasionally the singing begins to 
transcend the show's lowly script. The headliners are Vermettya Royster, 
formerly of the Clara Ward Singers, and David Whitfield. 
</P>
<P>
Royster's voice has an on-the-edge quality that can achieve remarkable effects. 
Whitfield's voice isn't quite as distinctive as Royster's, but he adds a 
sinuous swing of his shoulders and an impassioned delivery that's magnetic, in 
the right circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
These two sing an upbeat version of "God Bless the Child" that crackles with 
subtle wit and sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
These words cannot be applied to the rest of the production. It has the air of 
a community talent show, to which director-writer Delilah Williams kept adding 
more ingredients, more or less at random. 
</P>
<P>
At least Williams attempted to tie the first half of the show together as a 
musical history of blacks in America. Righteous slaves sing "Kum By Yah," 
Harriet Tubman sings "Steal Away," Sojourner Truth delivers her "Ain't I a 
Woman?" speech, and Booker T. Washington, William E.B. DuBois and Marcus Garvey 
begin to shout at each other about "What the Black Man Needs." 
</P>
<P>
The history falls apart after that. Narrator Edna Tatum tells us about the joys 
of summer, "when the livin' is easy," followed by a song, "Summer," that sounds 
like a blatant imitation of "Summertime." Black upward mobility in summed up 
with the theme song of the TV sitcom "The Jeffersons." 
</P>
<P>
Little musical comedy skits about life in a black congregation are followed by 
a cluster of half-baked celebrity impersonations, a scene in which parents 
reminisce about their children, and (out of the blue) "My Country 'Tis of 
Thee." Then, right after this burst of patriotism, is a reenactment of Rosa 
Parks' refusal to move to the back of the bus. 
</P>
<P>
Even this most dramatic of the show's scenes doesn't pack the punch it should. 
It's staged so that Parks is seated next to another black woman, who isn't even 
asked to move when a white man boards the bus. On one level, the man's order 
for Parks to move appears to be arbitrarily directed against her as an 
individual, rather than blacks as a group. (In fact, Parks was one of four 
blacks in the fifth row who were asked to move -- and the other three finally 
moved, when threatened with arrest.) 
</P>
<P>
After that scene, the history again vanishes, except for the general conclusion 
that it's God and the church that have held blacks together all these years. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, narrator Tatum is perched in a booth that visibly overlooks the 
stage. A gospel radio announcer, Tatum has a smooth Sunday morning sound that 
sometimes intrudes on the show's more animated moments. Nowhere is this more 
apparent than in Whitfield's introductory rendition of "Without a Song," during 
which Tatum recites each line just before Whitfield sings it -- as if he can't 
remember the words or as if we can't understand them. 
</P>
<P>
This device might work in a gospel concert, but not in a theater. Williams 
should give some more thought to the differences between the two arenas; 
theatrical savvy is conspicuously missing here. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10886 Le Conte Ave., Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 7:30 
p.m., Saturday and Sunday matinees at 3 p.m., indefinitely. Tickets: 
$19.95-$24.95; (213) 208-5454 or (213) 410-1062.

EX-SLAVE'S BATTLE WITH RACISM, SEXISM AND POVERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty." Those words were written in 1927 
by a brilliant American journalist whose long, controversial career as the 
nation's conscience began in 1884. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, PBS' "The American Experience" series, at 9 on channels 15 and 28, 
offers a keenly realized profile of Ida B. Wells, an African-American who used 
her potent skills as writer and orator to fight racism and sexism. 
</P>
<P>
Wells was born into slavery in 1862 Mississippi. She matured during the ferment 
of Reconstruction and its demise. She saw the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, the 
emergence of a black middle class and the apathy of the North. 
</P>
<P>
In 1892, in Memphis, where half the population was black, three of Wells' 
friends were lynched. She wrote scathing anti-lynching editorials in the black 
press, incurring extra wrath by connecting lynchings with sexism. 
</P>
<P>
She shrewdly urged a boycott of white businesses and encouraged thousands of 
blacks to leave Memphis. They did; Wells fled the South with a price on her 
head. 
</P>
<P>
She then took her painstakingly researched anti-lynching campaign to Britain 
where indignant public reaction embarrassed the United States into a belated 
moral outrage of its own. Lynchings decreased. 
</P>
<P>
Wells was the first black journalist inducted into the Tennessee Press Assn.'s 
Hall of Fame and was co-founder of the NAACP and other civil rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
Through interviews with historians, writers and sociologists, through powerful

Gardeners and other city workers who tend San Francisco's Golden Gate Park say 
crime and filth make their jobs dangerous, and they are seeking a crackdown on 
transients. Park workers -- who have drawn up a petition asking for strict 
enforcement of park rules, especially those against camping -- say they often 
find drug paraphernalia, feces and bloody clothing. They also say transients 
threaten them. "I just pruned and found three needles. You've got to have eyes 
behind your head. You always walk around with something in your hand," said one 
gardener who declined to give her name. The petition, which will be sent to 
Cal/OSHA, the job safety agency, was drafted with a new neighborhood group, 
Committee of Concerned Park Neighbors. In one of nearly 30 statements also 
being submitted, area resident William Rothrum wrote: "The entire east end is 
effectively blocked from family use because of the degree of filth and crime 
being tolerated by the city authorities." Parks Commission President Keith 
Eichman said the Recreation and Parks Department does not have control over who 
can enter the park.

WRONG BRINK'S CAR ROBBED, POLICE SAY

San Francisco police believe that the two gunmen who attacked a Brink's Inc. 
armored car three months ago, killing a company messenger and escaping without 
any money, mistakenly attacked the wrong vehicle. Another armored truck 
carrying more than $500,000 was scheduled to arrive at the Bank of America 
branch about the same time on Sept. 7, but was delayed by traffic, 
investigators disclosed. "It looks like they may have been planning to hit that 
one but got it confused with this one instead," said Lt. John Brunner of the 
robbery detail. The Brink's employees had just delivered more than $5,000 in 
Canadian currency when they were attacked. One of the robbers shot and killed 
one of the messengers and wounded his partner and a bystander who came to the 
Brink's employees' aid. The robbers escaped on bicycles.

Moderate earthquakes struck the Hollister area of Central California and the 
Coachella Valley in Southern California, but no damage or injuries were 
reported. The Hollister quake measured magnitude 4.1 and was centered in an 
area 13 miles south-southeast of town, the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park 
said. The Coachella Valley temblor was magnitude 4.2 and was centered nine 
miles east-northeast of the city of Indio, said a spokesman for the Caltech 
Seismology Center in Pasadena.

Dense fog shrouded the central San Joaquin Valley, closing airports, delaying 
and canceling school bus runs and, California Highway Patrol officers reported, 
causing several major chain-reaction pileups. One of the worst involved 12 to 
14 cars, pickups and truck-trailer rigs on California 41 near Fresno. No deaths 
were reported, but there were several major injuries, officers said. There also 
were chain-reaction pileups in Tulare and near Selma, but no major injuries 
were reported. The CHP said another traffic hazard was created northeast of 
Fresno when about 150 cows wandered onto a road after escaping from a nearby 
pasture. It took officers several hours to round up the cattle in the fog. 
Airports around the valley were fogged in until nearly noon.

GEORGE ALLEN EXPECTED TO TAKE LONG BEACH JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach is expected to announce today that former Ram coach George 
Allen will accept the football coaching job at the university, a source said 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
The university has scheduled a news conference for 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Allen met with 49er Athletic Director Corey Johnson over the weekend, but 
apparently no agreement could be reached at the time. Salary reportedly was one 
problem, since no 49er football coach has ever been paid more than $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Reisbig, 11-24 in three years as coach at Long Beach, resigned in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Allen implied the matter was still open. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I could have helped the school, but I have not accepted the job," 
Allen said from his office at the National Fitness Foundation in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
Allen has been away from coaching since 1978, returning only as an assistant 
for two weeks this past season with the school he first coached, Morningside 
College in Iowa, as part of its 100th year of football. 
</P>
<P>
He last coached in the NFL regular season with the Washington Redskins, going 
67-30-1 from 1971 through 1977. His 1972 team lost, 14-7, to Miami in Super 
Bowl VII. He also coached two exhibition games with the Rams in the 1978 season 
before being fired. 
</P>
<P>
Before going to Washington, he coached the Rams from 1966-70, compiling a 
49-17-4 record. His previous college experience included five years at 
Whittier.

NFL DRAFT MAY FACE CHALLENGE; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: TOP COLLEGE UNDERCLASSMEN ARE CONSIDERING SKIPPING SENIOR SEASONS 
BECAUSE OF A POSSIBLE ROOKIE SALARY CAP IN 1991. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE and ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Potential changes in the economic climate of the NFL could result in as many as 
40 college football underclassman applying for next April's draft. 
</P>
<P>
Leigh Steinberg, a sports attorney who has represented prominent athletes in 
negotiations with NFL teams, made that estimate Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Included in this group, according to Steinberg, are three highly regarded 
quarterbacks -- Heisman Trophy-winner Andre Ware of Houston, Jeff George of 
Illinois and Scott Mitchell of Utah. Linebackers Keith McCants of Alabama and 
Junior Seau of USC also are said to be among those considering such a move. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg said the anticipated exodus of underclassmen -- players with 
remaining collegiate eligibility -- is being prompted by NFL discussions of a 
possible cap on rookie salaries by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"So, what underclassmen fear and unscrupulous agents tell them is that we're 
sure salaries will be as strong in 1990 as they were in 1989, but 1991 could 
theoretically be the year of the salary cap," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Demoff, a Los Angeles sports attorney who represents pro quarterbacks 
John Elway, Jim Everett and Dan Marino, said uneasiness over the new collective 
bargaining agreement has prompted some agents to recommend that players forgo 
their remaining collegiate eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
"If that wasn't a risk these kids face, you wouldn't see so many thinking about 
the draft," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Demoff said other reasons for the trend are that football is one of the few 
sports that has successfully stopped athletes from leaving college early, and 
this season's success of Barry Sanders, the Heisman Trophy-winning tailback 
from Oklahoma State who challenged the NFL system last year and left school 
early. 
</P>
<P>
Well aware of what lies ahead, the NFL could fight to protect its rule that 
excludes underclassmen from the draft. 
</P>
<P>
Exceptions were made last year for Sanders and Timm Rosenbach, the Washington 
State quarterback. The NFL rationalized that Sanders' school was on probation 
and that Washington State changed coaches on Rosenbach. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, for a player to be part of the draft, he has to have either used up 
his eligibility or be able to show that he will graduate before the next NFL 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Browne, NFL spokesman, said the league has not abandoned its rules because 
of last year's exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that our rules are in the best interest of the overwhelming 
majority of college players," he said, adding that the figure of 40 
underclassman opting for the draft is not a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Browne said the league is concerned about those marginal players who abort 
their education for a chance at professional football. He cited the case of the 
Sanders brothers -- Barry, who has been a success for the Detroit Lions, and 
Byron, who left Northwestern for the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Byron Sanders was drafted but was cut and returned to school at his own 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
"For every Barry Sanders there are 10 Byron Sanders," Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Steinberg said the NFL eligibility rule has some interesting wrinkles. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the ways for a player to lose eligibility and become a participant in 
the draft is to sign with an agent," he said. "It's almost as if the NFL says 
underclassmen who are guilty of misconduct can have the privilege of coming out 
early and have an extra year of income, but those players who follow the rules 
need to stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
"The exceptions made for Sanders and Rosenbach would lead many people to 
believe that the NFL would like the rule to stay on the books but not to be 
tested. Obviously, the NFL has a wonderful system, with the colleges, in 
essence, acting as a farm system." 
</P>
<P>
And when football players look at Magic Johnson leaving Michigan State for a 
lucrative contract with the Lakers, or John McEnroe leaving Stanford for a rich 
career in pro tennis, they wonder why they are not afforded the same 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Browne insists the NFL is different from other sports and would defend its 
rules in litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg said: "Most legal observers believe that the NFL rule excluding 
underclassmen wouldn't stand the test of judicial scrutiny; that if challenged, 
the rule will fall. 
</P>
<P>
"The point is, if they allowed underclassmen into the NFL, it would not destroy 
college football. There are 100 players on those rosters. It hasn't destroyed 
college basketball, which has 10 or 15 players on rosters." 
</P>
<P>
NCAA officials are also concerned with any departure from the norm. But 
administrators and educators are divided on what course to take. Some believe 
in the free enterprise system, while others are more concerned with students 
staying to graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a university should be for someone who wants to be there," said 
William Reeves, the faculty athletic representative for Texas Arlington. "If 
someone can make a better living outside the university, let them." 
</P>
<P>
Reeves, a member of the NCAA's Professional Sports Liaison Committee, said his 
feelings are bolstered by the fact Arlington does not have a football team. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Ann Lawler, also a member of the NCAA committee and an associate athletic 
director at Florida, where there is a big-time football team, partially agrees 
with Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no problem if they are ready to go and they can make it," Lawler said. 
"I don't think you can ask a kid who is signing for a million dollars to stay. 
But I feel sorry for the ones on the edge." 
</P>
<P>
Lawler said she understands athletes' concerns over potential injury in their 
senior seasons but believes emphasis should be placed on graduation. Although 
past statistics show poor graduation records for many football schools, Lawler 
said recent NCAA rules indicate there will be an improvement in this area. 
</P>
<P>
So, she is concerned with the number of underclassman considering the NFL draft 
as an alternative to higher education. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a trend the NCAA doesn't like," she said. 
</P>
<P>
It is a trend that has clouded the future for some players. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Carrier, USC's All-American strong safety who redshirted as a freshman, 
indicated that he will return for his senior season, then hedged by saying he 
might re-evaluate his options after the Rose Bowl game against Michigan on New 
Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just learning about the NFL," Carrier said. "I haven't talked to any 
agents or picked one. My decision (now) is that I'll be back in school." 
</P>
<P>
USC's Seau, a junior who lost his freshman year of eligibility because of the 
Proposition 48 academic rule, said he is still undecided, adding: "I'm a USC 
Trojan come January 1, and we'll see from there on, but I'm leaning on coming 
back (to school)." 
</P>
<P>
Although Carrier has another year of eligibility, he will be only two classes 
short of graduating in May and could conceivably take them in summer school, 
thereby enabling him to graduate before the start of the '90 NFL season. 
</P>
<P>
Seau, however, would be ineligible for the '90 draft, according to a strict 
interpretation of the NFL rule. 
</P>
<P>
Demoff, the Los Angeles attorney, said the warning from agents is not 
unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some kids would pull back if the NFL gave them some guarantee that 
there will not be a wage scale in 1991," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the owners cannot do that, they can expect to have a full house for the 
draft in April.

MIKE DOWNEY: SOMETIMES, THE CHEER GOES OUT OF THE HOLIDAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
Because I am feeling all Christmassy, I suppose, this is going to be the most 
melancholy, most maudlin column I have written in some time. Hope you won't 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
I am in a bad, sad mood, because I have just read the most depressing newspaper 
pages I have read in a long, long time. 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't the paper's fault. It just printed the facts. Didn't blow them out of 
proportion. Treated them with the proper dignity. 
</P>
<P>
It's just that by the time I stopped reading, I had a sick feeling in the pit 
of my stomach. Because these stories made me think of human beings, and what 
they have to endure. Made me think of the holidays, and how merry we all long 
to be. 
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that Tom Gray, a football player from Cal State Northridge, 
collapsed while socializing with friends Friday night and died after desperate 
efforts to revive him. He was 21 years old. 
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that Mike Goff, a basketball player from Fullerton College, 
collapsed at his Anaheim home Saturday after eating breakfast and was rushed to 
a hospital, where he died. He was 19. 
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that Ramon Ramos, a rookie basketball player for the 
Portland Trail Blazers, remained comatose in a hospital after being critically 
injured in an automobile accident. He is 22. 
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that Kevin Copeland was honored as Southern California's top 
high school football player at a banquet Sunday in Anaheim, a few weeks after 
collapsing during a Dorsey High School football game against San Pedro and 
dying of heart failure. He was 17. 
</P>
<P>
My heartfelt sympathy goes out to the families and friends of these kids, and I 
pray that not too many others need know such silent nights this Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
I know what it's like. It was only a couple of Christmases ago when both of my 
parents occupied rooms in the same hospital, one floor apart, too immobilized 
even to visit one another, one by a stroke, the other by lung disease. You 
haven't hated Christmas until a doctor telephones you at 3 a.m. and tells you 
to get back over to the hospital, because your father might not make it through 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody wants to go out and sing carols and be cheerful each Christmas. Well, 
I'm sorry. I just don't have it in me. Christmas to me means only two things 
this year. It's Christ's birthday. And it's Monday. That's it. 
</P>
<P>
But we go along, doing what we have to do, making our plans, buying our gifts, 
doing our jobs. I'll probably spend the holidays watching football games. Joy 
to the world. 
</P>
<P>
I'm alive, so I should simply rejoice in that. You should, too. Hang onto 
someone you love this Christmas. Spend time with friends or relatives. Me, I'm 
all Scrooged out. You, you should appreciate people while they're still here, 
hug them tightly. Not everyone can. 
</P>
<P>
Tommie Gray was visiting friends near the University Park housing complex in 
Northridge, just before midnight Friday, when a playful wrestling match began 
by the swimming pool. Tommie, 6-foot-3 and 235 pounds, extremely popular with 
coaches and teammates, put a big, friendly bearhug on a buddy. They were 
fooling around, seeing which one could toss the other into the pool. 
</P>
<P>
Then he went limp. 
</P>
<P>
He had what appeared to be a seizure. Tommie's roommate, Derrick Smith, put his 
fingers in his friend's mouth, trying to keep him from swallowing his tongue. 
Tommie was unconscious. Derrick then ran to find campus police, who in turn 
called the fire department. 
</P>
<P>
One of the cops used CPR on Tommie and appeared to have revived him. Then, just 
as suddenly, he expired. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Goff played basketball Friday night for Fullerton College. Two nights 
earlier, he had scored 25 points. He had been the team's most valuable player 
the season before. His high school coach at Anaheim Magnolia, where Mike once 
scored 53 in one game, called him the best player the school ever had. 
</P>
<P>
Mike got up Saturday morning and ate breakfast with his parents. He said he 
wasn't feeling well. He got up from the table, walked into the living room and 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
He was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Ramos was one of the standouts for a Seton Hall team that came within one 
point of the NCAA basketball championship eight months ago, and part of Puerto 
Rico's Olympic team 15 months ago. He had been eagerly awaiting his first 
minute in an NBA game, having just been activated Dec. 8 after spending his 
entire season to date on injured reserve. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon was driving on an interstate 15 miles outside Portland when he lost 
control of his car Saturday at about 3:15 a.m. The car crossed the median and 
flipped, rolling over several times. Ramon was thrown from the vehicle, 
possibly as high as 40 feet in the air, police estimate. He was not wearing a 
seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
After three hours of neurosurgery, doctors detected clear indication of brain 
damage. Ramon's chances of survival were called 50-50 at best. 
</P>
<P>
Because they involved athletes, the stories of these tragedies were placed on 
the morning sports page. The families don't care about sports anymore. They 
don't care about Christmas, either. They just want their kids back.

ORTMAYER DISMISSED BY CHARGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Chargers announced Monday that Steve Ortmayer, director of 
football operations since January 1987, will not be offered a contract next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve and I met today," Charger Owner Alex Spanos said. "I want to thank him 
for the effort he has made to make the Chargers a stronger team. Our meeting 
was amicable, and we wish him well in future endeavors." 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer, 44, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation all season that Spanos was considering replacing 
Ortmayer with Bobby Beathard, former general manager of the Washington 
Redskins, who left Washington at the conclusion of the 1988 season. Beathard 
owns a home in Leucadia, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer, director of football operations for the Raiders from 1978 through 
January of 1987, found both personal success and failure with the Chargers. In 
1988, the Chargers' first pick was Anthony Miller, now one of the top receivers 
in the AFC. Also drafted in '88 was tackle David Richards, who has started all 
31 games since. 
</P>
<P>
This season's draft included defensive end Burt Grossman, quarterback Billy Joe 
Tolliver and running back Marion Butts, all significant contributors. 
</P>
<P>
But if Ortmayer's draft picks were his strength, trades were his undoing. He 
gambled in trading for Chip Banks in 1987. Banks is with Indianapolis. He sat 
out all of last season and was arrested four times on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer was also responsible for trading All-Pro offensive lineman Jim Lachey 
to the Raiders for Napoleon McCallum, cut before this season, and offensive 
lineman John Clay, who likely will not play again because of a neck injury. 
</P>
<P>
Charger Coach Dan Henning expressed regrets at Ortmayer's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed that Steve won't be with us," Henning said. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him handle the draft as well as it can be handled, and I think we had an 
outstanding draft. I've seen him put a great deal of time and effort into 
getting things where they ought to be. And I see the progress. But wins and 
losses are what the perception is always. That's what we have to do a better 
job of."

Rookie Ramon Ramos of the Portland Trail Blazers, in a coma since suffering a 
severe brain injury in an auto accident early Saturday, underwent emergency 
surgery after taking a sudden turn for the worse. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kim Burchiel, head of neurosurgery at Oregon Health Sciences University, 
said the latest surgery appeared to be successful and that pressure on the 
right side of the brain had returned to normal when the operation ended. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos remained in critical condition with what doctors say is a 50-50 chance to 
live.

JETS HIRE DICK STEINBERG AS GM; PATRIOTS THREATEN LEGAL ACTION

Dick Steinberg, former director of player personnel for the Rams who later 
helped build the New England Patriots into a Super Bowl team, was hired as 
general manager of the New York Jets Monday amid threats of legal action by the 
Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg, 54, accepted a contract estimated at five years for nearly $3.25 
million to become the Jets' first general manager in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Patriot General Manager Pat Sullivan, interviewed on WBZ-TV in Boston, said 
director of college scouting Joe Mendez was appointed to replace Steinberg and 
that the team was going to take legal action over the way the Steinberg matter 
was conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said the Patriots would seek compensation of some kind, maybe in a 
trade or monetary form. "We basically felt there are provisions in this 
contract . . . that were violated," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets are 4-11, their worst record in seven seasons under Coach Joe Walton. 
</P>
<P>
Although Steinberg's role with the Patriots had not changed under new owner 
Victor Kiam, he did not have the power there he will have with the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg, the director of player development for the Patriots, has disagreed 
with Kiam, General Manager Patrick Sullivan and Coach Raymond Berry on some 
recent personnel moves, including the waiving of quarterback Tony Eason, who 
started for the Jets Sunday.

WHITE HOUSE REVEALS SECRET MISSION TO BEIJING IN JULY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The White House disclosed Monday that only one month after China's 
pro-democracy movement was crushed by the massacre in Beijing's Tian An Men 
Square, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft made a secret trip to China 
to meet with government leaders there. 
</P>
<P>
The White House said that the July visit was to present an official but private 
U.S. protest about the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. The 
disclosure is expected to add fuel to the storm of criticism that greeted the 
announcement that Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. 
Eagleburger visited Beijing on Dec. 8 and 9. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the crackdown in June, President Bush announced that he had cut 
off high-level diplomatic exchanges with the Chinese -- an informal sanction 
apparently disregarded in the case of Scowcroft's July visit. He also 
temporarily terminated sales of U.S. equipment to the Chinese armed forces, but 
he came under fierce criticism for not reacting more strongly. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed Scowcroft's July trip only 
after it was reported by Cable News Network. He said that Bush sent Scowcroft 
to the Chinese capital "to personally underscore the United States' shock and 
concern about the violence" and to "impress upon the Chinese government the 
seriousness with which this incident was viewed in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
"The President felt this face-to-face mission, like the one recently completed 
by Gen. Scowcroft, was necessary to show the sense of purpose and direction of 
the United States government," Fitzwater added in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater would not reveal the dates of Scowcroft's first trip. He said that he 
was unaware of any visits other than the two now revealed but said that he 
could not say there were no others. 
</P>
<P>
While the first visit was intended to protest the violent crackdown, Fitzwater 
said, the second was intended to move the United States and China beyond the 
standoff that followed. 
</P>
<P>
Disclosure of the July trip drew sharp criticism from Rep. Samuel Gejdenson 
(D-Conn.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who said that Bush 
"has misled the American people and the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
"Most people felt the President stated U.S. policy as cutting off high-level 
contacts. This pulls aside the charade that there was an attempt here to do 
business with the moderates" in the Chinese leadership, he said in a telephone 
interview. "It sends a signal around the globe that you can kill people and the 
Bush Administration will not hold you accountable for any period of time." 
</P>
<P>
But Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) restated his support of the President's China 
initiative, saying: "Bush has demonstrated such a unique style and such 
dominance of the decision-making process that Congress has been left quibbling 
on a limb that bears surprisingly little weight." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's experience as the American envoy to China in the mid-1970s has led him 
to take a personal interest in U.S.-Chinese affairs. He has steadfastly 
resisted pressure from Congress and elsewhere to impose tougher sanctions 
against China in the wake of the June 3-4 crackdown that claimed hundreds, 
perhaps thousands, of lives. 
</P>
<P>
Officials, who have said that the President acts as his own secretary of state 
when dealing with China, reported that the Scowcroft-Eagleburger mission to 
China earlier this month was at the President's suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has said repeatedly during the last week that the most recent Scowcroft 
trip was undertaken to end the isolation of China's 1 billion citizens and that 
there had been indications the Chinese leadership was responding positively. 
Bush has not elaborated, but others have pointed to China's decision to let the 
Voice of America assign a new correspondent to Beijing. The previous 
correspondent was expelled after the June crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there has been mounting evidence that the United States and China 
are moving toward a deal that would free astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and his 
wife, dissidents who took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing after the 
crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with news agency reporters Monday at the White House, Bush said 
that he does not know when the couple will be able to leave the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to critics who said that the Scowcroft-Eagleburger trip this month 
represented a willingness on the part of the President to "kow-tow" to 
hard-line Chinese leaders, Bush said, "I don't think it's a salute." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the criticism was "not a good rap" but that a President must be 
ready "to take a little heat from time to time. It hasn't been that much." He 
said that his critics have been "dealing with emotion and not facts." 
</P>
<P>
He urged skeptics to "be a little patient and wait and see" whether his 
initiative produces results from Beijing.

OBSTETRICIAN CONVICTED OF MURDERING 8 BABIES, FETUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GABE FUENTES and STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Milos Klvana, a Valencia obstetrician, was convicted Monday of 
second-degree murder in the deaths of eight infants and a fetus he cared for, 
in a case the prosecutor said raises questions about the ability of California 
medical authorities to monitor the competence of doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Klvana, 49, faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison. Each 
murder count carries a sentence of 15 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The nine deaths with which Klvana was charged occurred between 1982 and 1986. 
Eight infants died during childbirth or within a few days of their delivery. 
The ninth case involved a fetus that died in its mother's womb. 
</P>
<P>
During Klvana's nine-month trial in Los Angeles Superior Court, the prosecution 
contended that he lacked the medical skill and the facilities at his clinics in 
Valencia and Temple City to perform out-of-hospital births and to deal with 
common but high-risk prenatal or childbirth complications. 
</P>
<P>
The jury deliberated 15 days before returning the verdicts last week. They were 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
After Klvana was found guilty, prosecutor Brian R. Kelberg said outside the 
courtroom that the case shows that the public should not place an unwavering 
faith in a doctor simply because he has a valid medical license. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing that can come out of this trial is an awareness by the public 
that merely because a doctor has a license to practice, or may have hospital 
privileges, or may have a great bedside manner, and merely because there is a 
medical board that is supposed to monitor the competence of doctors, that in no 
way assures that a doctor is in fact competent," said Kelberg, head of the 
medico-legal section of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"Patients should be willing to ask questions and not be intimidated because 
they may not have been to medical school," Kelberg said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Klvana case, the state Board of Medical Quality Assurance investigated 
four of the deaths but did not revoke Klvana's license as a result of the 
probes. The reason, Kelberg said, was Klvana's ability to manipulate Board of 
Medical Quality Assurance investigators. The prosecutor has said these 
investigators "deserve lambasting." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Kraemer, the board's assistant chief of enforcement in Sacramento, said the 
agency will have no comment "until we see what the prosecutor said." 
</P>
<P>
The nine deaths all had two things in common: medical complications that 
prosecution experts testified required hospital treatment and Klvana's failure 
to recommend hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
Kelberg called the complications "bread-and-butter" matters, such as prolonged 
labor, abnormal positioning of the baby, a diabetic mother and a baby that had 
ingested its own fecal material. Six of the deaths were attributed by the 
prosecution to Klvana's misuse of Pitocin, a labor-inducing drug that put 
deadly pressure on babies' heads as they were forced through the birth canal. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot view any one of these cases in isolation," Kelberg said, "because 
you see the same type of care or lack of care in case after case after case." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the nine murder counts, Klvana was convicted on 28 counts of 
insurance fraud, five of practicing medicine without a license, two of grand 
theft, two of perjury and one count of conspiracy. All of the charges are 
felonies. 
</P>
<P>
Richard A. Leonard, one of Klvana's two court-appointed attorneys, argued 
during the trial that Klvana was at worst guilty of manslaughter, not murder. 
</P>
<P>
After the verdicts were announced, Leonard said his client was "tough" to 
defend because "there were nine dead babies and with nine all together I didn't 
stand a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Leonard added, "It looked terrible. There were no facts for the defense. 
Everywhere we checked we came up dry. I didn't have one doctor to put up on the 
stand." 
</P>
<P>
Jury foreman Jaime Pulido, 30, of East Los Angeles said it became clear during 
jury deliberations that there was "no defense" for Klvana, who was arrested in 
October, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"We had experts from all over the county who were called in to testify against 
him," Pulido said. The defense "had the same right to use those experts, but 
they chose not to." 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, but to no avail. The evidence 
against him was overwhelming," Pulido said. 
</P>
<P>
Klvana was prosecuted on the same legal basis used to obtain second-degree 
murder convictions against drunk drivers who cause fatal traffic crashes. Under 
the concept known as "implied malice," a defendant can be convicted of murder 
if the prosecution proves that he knew his actions could cause someone else's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Klvana was born in Czechoslovakia and received his medical training there. 
Following the Soviet Union's 1968 occupation of his native country, Klvana fled 
to Canada and then the United States. He began practicing in Southern 
California in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Medical Quality Assurance first investigated Klvana's involvement 
in a baby's death after Amy Johnson died on Christmas Day, 1982. Klvana had 
delivered the baby the day before. But in this and three other baby deaths 
involving Klvana that the board investigated, the agency took no action against 
his medical license. 
</P>
<P>
The board was sharply criticized earlier this year by the state's watchdog 
Little Hoover Commission and the University of San Diego's Center for Public 
Interest Law. Alluding to the University of San Diego report, which recommended 
that physician licensing fees be raised to beef up the board's investigative 
staff, Kelberg said: "I am not confident that merely by adding money and 
personnel the medical board can do the kind of investigation that may be 
necessary to ensure that doctors like Dr. Klvana do not practice medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing that is necessary is public awareness." 
</P>
<P>
Kelberg also criticized hospitals that allowed Klvana to resign without 
reporting his substandard care to the medical board, which then had to "operate 
in the dark." Those hospitals included Northridge Hospital Medical Center, 
Valley Vista Hospital in San Gabriel and Granada Hills Community Hospital, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Judith C. Chirlin scheduled Klvana's sentencing for Jan. 12.

VANISHING FOUR-YEAR DEGREES; 
</P>
<P>
MORE STUDENTS ARE TAKING THEIR TIME GETTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION. HIGH COSTS, 
FAMILY OBLIGATIONS AND CROWDED CLASSES MAKE THEM ASK, WHY RUSH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's been nearly eight years since Adrienne DeVine began working on her 
bachelor's degree. As the mother of four children, the Cal State Long Beach art 
and journalism student has had plenty of cause to take light course loads and 
time off. But she expects to finally receive her diploma in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to take this long and there were some times when I thought I 
wouldn't make it," says DeVine, who is 35 and describes the juggling of school 
and family as exhausting even with much support from her husband. "You need 
friends and colleagues to boost you up and tell you it will be worth it in the 
long run," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
DeVine is certainly not alone in her marathon schooling. For increasing numbers 
of American students, a college education is more than just a four-year 
struggle with English literature, dormitory roommates and tuition bills. More 
frequently, it is a five-, six- or even 10-year experience. 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies in California and across the nation show a significant drop-off 
in the percentage of entering college freshmen who earn their baccalaureate 
degrees in four years. In fact, only a quarter of public university students do 
it within four and a half years. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the day of the actual four-year degree is gone," explains Dale 
Heckman, an analyst with the California Postsecondary Education Commission. 
</P>
<P>
All sorts of causes are cited by statisticians, administrators and students. 
Among those are the increased need to hold jobs to cope with higher school 
costs and cuts in financial aid, larger numbers of older students with 
families, difficulties in enrolling in required and crowded classes, more time 
off for travel and internships, frequent switching of majors, transferring to 
different colleges, and a slower pace in hopes of getting better grades. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, there is the traditional undergraduate neurosis: fear of entering the 
unpleasant outside world because they're having too much fun. "Why rush?" asked 
a UCLA junior who expects to be on the Westwood campus for six years. 
</P>
<P>
Some state legislators and education experts have an answer for that young man. 
Moving students more quickly to graduation is simply more efficient and, at 
public institutions, saves tax dollars, they assert. If more students finished 
in four years, the University of California and California State University 
systems might feel less of a need to build additional -- and very expensive -- 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some educators say there is nothing magical about finishing 
in four years. A slower pace, they stress, encourages a wider range of studies, 
more extracurricular activities and more maturity. Besides, part-time students 
tend to be more serious. 
</P>
<P>
The trend of longer college careers is particularly noticeable in the Cal State 
system, with its increasing rolls of returning and part-time students. 
According to a new study, the percentage of Cal State students who earn a 
degree within five years has dropped from about 30% for those who entered as 
freshmen in 1973 to about 25% for the freshmen of 1983. However, the report's 
good news is that those who continue for longer than five years and are 
considered likely to graduate has risen from 15% to 27% during the same time. 
</P>
<P>
That study, titled "Those Who Stay," suggests that educators should start 
looking at graduation rates during 10 years rather than four or five. Jerry 
Vargas, a broadcast studies major at Cal State Los Angeles, agrees. Now in his 
sixth year at the school, he expects to graduate in the spring. "Hardly anybody 
gets out in four years," said Vargas, who was slowed down by jobs and switching 
majors several times. 
</P>
<P>
A recent U.S. Department of Education study compared freshmen across the nation 
who entered four-year colleges directly out of high school in 1972 to those who 
began in 1980. At public institutions, only 25% of the 1980 group earned their 
degrees within four and a half years, down from 40% for the 1972 freshmen. At 
private schools the share dropped to 46% from 50%. At the same time, however, 
there were rises in the percentages of non-graduates still enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
One example of that trend is UC Santa Barbara student Chris Lowe. Adding a 
second major of fine arts to the near completion of a business degree is 
lengthening his university education to possibly six years. "I'm glad I'm 
discovering this interest now," said Lowe, who was at UC Riverside for two 
years and is now in his second year at UC Santa Barbara. "I still have a good 
deal of time to make up my mind on what I will do with the rest of my life." He 
works part time now at an accounting firm and is considering a career in 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Lowe, 21, said he notices that many UC students take 12 units a quarter instead 
of the maximum 16 units in hopes of getting better grades for graduate school 
applications. Others, he added, "just like to take their time because they are 
not really ready to get out in the real world." 
</P>
<P>
John Sarvey, UCLA's undergraduate student body president, enrolled at the 
Westwood campus in the fall of 1984 and expects to graduate this spring. He 
took two quarters off to earn money and was also slowed down by a switch from a 
premedical curriculum to a self-designed major called organizational studies, 
which combines sociology, political science, psychology and economics. And, of 
course, being a student leader takes time away from classes. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost everybody I know takes at least five years, especially if they choose 
to take advantage of being involved in any of the many opportunities there are 
at UCLA," Sarvey said. He recalled that one friend managed to graduate within 
the traditional four years and later regretted it, especially since he couldn't 
find a job for four months. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the fifth year has become standard in the UC system. Of the UC students 
who enrolled as freshmen in 1982, only 31% finished in four years, but that 
jumped up to 59% within an additional year, according to UC officials. Unlike 
Cal State, UC discourages part-time students. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of UC Davis and UC Riverside graduates found that the most important 
reason for needing more than four years was taking extra courses for personal 
interest. Ranked next was the need to earn money, followed by changing majors. 
Also mentioned were lack of counseling, stress, trouble getting registered in 
required courses, family problems, athletics and time off to travel. 
</P>
<P>
California's public higher education systems -- with their many accessible 
campuses, relatively low costs, and ease of transferring -- have an atmosphere 
that encourages a slow pace to graduation, according to Prof. Alexander Astin, 
director of UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute. "Dropping out and 
coming back is much more acceptable and more of an established practice in 
California than other places in the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The much higher cost of attending private colleges and universities forces 
their students through faster, Astin said. But a more important reason why 
students at independent schools finish faster, he added, is that private 
schools tend to give more attention to counseling and allow more personal 
contact with professors than the enormous public institutions do. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even the National Institute of Independent Colleges and Universities looks 
at graduation rates over six years. "Even when you have the proper counseling, 
you can't account for changing majors," explained Oscar Porter, the institute's 
assistant executive director in Washington. "You've got to remember, we are 
talking about people under age 25. Planning every moment of their lives over 
the next week, never mind the next few years, is not something they do often. 
None of us at that age did." 
</P>
<P>
UC analyst John Sewart says that public universities are working to improve 
counseling and making sure that seniors get the classes they need to graduate. 
But the idea of a four-year college education may have been something of a 
myth, he said, because delays and changes always have been the very nature of 
intellectual pursuit and self-discovery. 
</P>
<P>
"What can we do if students thought they were interested in literature and now 
find they are interested in science? We have to be supportive of that," Sewart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Allowing such freedom and accommodating older, part-time students make it 
difficult to reverse the trend toward longer educations, state Sen. Becky 
Morgan (R-Los Altos Hills) discovered. She authored legislation that led to a 
study of the issue by the post-secondary education commission last year. 
</P>
<P>
Increases in financial aid might help students get through faster, as would 
better counseling, CPEC found. But Morgan's legislative consultant, Margie 
Chisholm, said big boosts in scholarships are not likely to emerge from a tight 
budget in Sacramento. And other legislative efforts to hurry students to 
bachelor degrees probably would not accomplish much, Chisolm said. 
</P>
<P>
The issue may arise again when legislators start to debate spending billions of 
dollars on 22 proposed community colleges, five new Cal State and three more UC 
campuses. Meanwhile, Chisolm says, the causes of the five- and six-year degree 
"sounds to me like forces beyond our control." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest of those forces is the increasing numbers of what educators call 
"non-traditional students" -- those who are older than 25 or attend school part 
time. Between 1977 and 1987, the national share of such students among all 
undergraduates jumped from 40% to 48% and will soon be more than 50%, according 
to the Pew Higher Education Research Program at the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
DeVine, the Cal State Long Beach senior, exemplifies that. After a false start 
at another school and a technical degree in printmaking, she began a university 
preparatory program at Pasadena City College in 1981 and then transferred to 
the Long Beach campus. 
</P>
<P>
She urges other older students not to give up. "Don't let one failure or one 
false start prevent you from continuing even if you can only take one class at 
a time," said DeVine, who will be looking for a job in publishing or journalism 
after receiving her elusive degree in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will all be worthwhile," she said of her studies. "Or at least ask 
me in a couple of years."

A bomb was safely removed from the building housing the federal 11th Circuit 
Court of Appeals on Monday, but a Savannah attorney was killed when another 
bomb exploded in his office. The fatal blast came two days after the package 
bomb murder of an 11th Circuit judge in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
In Birmingham, Ala., where authorities were investigating the bombing that 
killed U.S. Circuit Judge Robert S. Vance on Saturday, FBI Agent Tom Moore 
said: "The preliminary investigation (in Savannah) indicates strong 
similarities to the other explosive devices in Birmingham and Atlanta." 
</P>
<P>
The FBI said the attacks might be linked to the August, 1989, tear gas bombing 
of the NAACP's regional headquarters in Atlanta. Special Agent William Hinshaw 
said in Savannah that the agency is warning lawyers, judges and NAACP activists 
in Georgia and Alabama to be suspicious of strange packages. 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, frightened employees were evacuated from the five-story downtown 
court building before the device discovered there early in the day was disarmed 
by munitions experts. Security was tightened at other federal buildings in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that the Atlanta bomb had been found in a package in the 
courthouse mail room. They refused to say to whom it was addressed but said it 
resembles the powerful device that killed Vance and severely injured his wife, 
Helen, at their Mountain Brook, Ala., home in the Birmingham suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they are exploring a possible connection between the Atlanta 
and Birmingham bombs. Officials said that the two incidents have been placed at 
the top of the FBI's list of investigations. 
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you, we will leave no stone unturned," FBI agent Allen P. 
Whitaker told a news conference in Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Holland, a postal inspector, told the same news conference that "there 
could be a significant connection between the two packages." 
</P>
<P>
In Savannah, attorney Robert Robinson, a black civil rights activist and city 
alderman, died after undergoing emergency surgery for injuries he suffered in 
the bomb blast in his office around 5 p.m., officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, 42, "lost his right arm, his left hand and some upper body tissue and 
(had) severe damage to his legs," according to a fellow alderman, Floyd Adams. 
</P>
<P>
A federal official who assisted in the investigation of the Savannah attack 
described the "grisly" scene in Robinson's office in the city's historic 
district, where the bomb blew a rectangular hole in the attorney's second-floor 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been difficult to imagine anyone surviving that attack," said 
the official, Lance Hearns, an agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Hearns said the package had been delivered in the regular mail just before noon 
Monday, but that Robinson had not collected it until he returned to the office. 
</P>
<P>
"He carried it upstairs to his private office," Hearns said. "It was a very 
unfortunate scene." 
</P>
<P>
At a Savannah news conference late Monday, FBI agent Bob DeLoach said it was 
"definitely a possibility" that white supremacists had sent the bomb that 
killed Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Hinshaw said the FBI also warned the NAACP that the attacks appear to be 
related to the Aug. 22, 1989, tear-gas mail bomb attack at the NAACP's Atlanta 
offices, in which eight people, including an infant, were injured. 
</P>
<P>
The caustic gas bomb was sent to the civil rights organization via Postal 
Service "Priority Mail." It was addressed only to the NAACP, not to any 
individual, and had a phony return address. 
</P>
<P>
Several investigators in Birmingham trying to find clues to Vance's murder were 
immediately dispatched to Atlanta Monday. Both the Atlanta and Birmingham 
devices are said to be "nail bombs," in which nails are packed into an 
explosive device, and both were delivered through the mail. In addition to the 
FBI, the Marshals Service and Postal Service, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms and local police officers and sheriff's deputies are 
taking part in the investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities continued to comb court records, looking for cases that could 
provide motives for the judge's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-member 11th Circuit handles federal appeals from Alabama, Georgia and 
Florida, and the bulk of the circuit's caseload is drug-related. Investigators 
said that they are ruling out no possibility, including the theory that 
Colombian cocaine bosses may be behind the murder. 
</P>
<P>
However, in Washington, a senior official who is close to the investigation 
went to great lengths to play down that possibility, asserting that all the 
characteristics of the bombing make it unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"None of it seems to match what you would expect from trained killers trying to 
deliver a message," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Another official said, "I don't think it makes any sense. You look at 
motivation in this business, and the only person who says, 'I'd like to get rid 
of that appeals court judge,' is a trial court judge who has been reversed (by 
the appellate court jurist)." 
</P>
<P>
The official, emphasizing that he was being facetious to make a point, said 
that appellate court judges "are, by and large, a pretty faceless people. You 
have to look very carefully at a newspaper report of their decisions to see who 
wrote them. It wouldn't make a point" for Colombian drug kingpins to be going 
after an appellate court judge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A knowledgeable source said Monday night that several federal judges in Florida 
had received anonymous telephone calls from a man with a Spanish accent on the 
afternoon that Vance was killed. 
</P>
<P>
According to the source, the caller asked each of the judges whether Vance were 
there and then hung up. Not until they learned later that Vance had been 
assassinated did the Florida judges suspect that the calls may have been meant 
as a warning, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Although investigators have refused to disclose details about the mail bombs, a 
source close to the investigation disclosed that the package sent to Vance bore 
the return address of Judge Lewis R. Morgan, a colleague on the 11th Circuit. 
</P>
<P>
On seeing the familiar name on the brown-paper-wrapped box, Mrs. Vance said to 
her husband: "Look, here's a package from Judge Morgan," said the source, who 
is familiar with what the widow told investigators. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder if he's sending me some more magazines like he did last year," Vance 
responded. Moments later, the bomb exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Vance was only the third federal judge to be killed in this century. 
</P>
<P>
The judge, who was highly praised as a scholar and as a person, has been 
controversial at times. In 1985, he told a lawyer trying to prevent deportation 
of 1,500 Cuban refugees that the U.S. government "can keep the detainees in the 
Atlanta pen until they die." 
</P>
<P>
That same year, he was on a panel that cleared the way for prosecution of Ku 
Klux Klansmen in a violent 1979 confrontation with black civil rights marchers 
in Decatur. 
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the judge's murder, the Savannah bombing 
or the placing of the Atlanta bomb. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta bomb was discovered shortly after 9:30 Monday morning in the court 
building's mail room during an X-ray examination of mail. Pictures of it showed 
what "looked like electric wires," a mail room employee said. 
</P>
<P>
Court officials telephoned authorities, who carefully examined the device, 
taking fingerprints and other information that could help identify the bomb's 
sender. At around noon, a member of the Atlanta police bomb squad, along with 
an FBI official, emerged from the building carrying the device. They loaded it 
onto a red truck, which sped away under police escort as bystanders looked on. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb was taken to a site near the police academy, where it was safely 
defused late Monday afternoon. Officials said that they will examine the 
device, part by part. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agent Whitaker said that the Atlanta bomb was addressed "to someone in the 
court system," but he refused to elaborate. One source close to the 
investigation said that the bomb package carried the return address of an 
Atlanta attorney, but he refused to disclose the name, saying, "It's being 
checked out." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the incidents, law enforcement officials have extended their 
precautionary warnings beyond judges to other court employees and their 
families. "We have notified court families to use procedures" that include 
screening any items they receive at home or work, Marshal Thomas C. Greene told 
the Birmingham news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Security measures were heightened at federal courthouses around the country 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, about two-thirds of Los Angeles' 30 federal District Court 
judges met with the U.S. Marshal, officials of the U.S. Postal Service and the 
Los Angeles Police Department bomb squad at the federal courthouse to discuss 
security procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Terry T. Hatter said the meeting was useful but that he didn't plan to do 
anything dramatically different. "We're going to be more cautious, that's just 
using common sense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian said, "I don't think (the Vance killing) 
is going to intimidate any judge in this country. We have a lot of confidence 
in the Marshals Service." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Marshal Samuel Cicchino would not divulge what had been discussed in the 
meeting with the judges and said there would be no major changes in security at 
the U.S. courthouse. For years, all persons entering the building from Spring 
Street or Main Street have been required to pass through a metal detector, and 
every piece of mail and every package that arrives at the courthouse is put 
through an X-ray machine. 
</P>
<P>
Cicchino said that on Monday one box that looked suspicious on an X-ray machine 
was opened by the police bomb squad. He said it turned out to be a package of 
Christmas cookies. 
</P>
<P>
The marshal said that any person who receives an unordered package or anything 
else in the mail that looks suspicious should call the 911 emergency number and 
ask for help. 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, the headquarters of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, 
clerks diverted all mail for appellate judges to the main federal courthouse, 
where it was X-rayed. Court of Appeals judges were given the option of having 
their personal mail checked, Mark Mendenhall, assistant executive for the 
circuit court, said. 
</P>
<P>
Clerks were "taking very seriously" the possibility of violence and were 
seeking authorization for a screening device for mail and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like them in place today," Mendenhall said. "Working through Washington 
takes longer than today." 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, the U.S. Marshal's office said it had taken several specific 
additional security measures at the federal courthouse but would not spell them 
out. Because of previous terrorist trials in Chicago and sensitive gang 
prosecutions, security at Chicago courts is already at a relatively high level. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Associated Press reported that Florida Gov. Bob 
Martinez, who said his life has been threatened by Colombian drug barons, said 
Monday that, as a result of Vance's assassination, he will consider wearing a 
bulletproof vest. Martinez said he would reevaluate his previous refusal to 
follow the advice of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which had urged 
the governor to wear the vest during some public appearances.

VAN DE KAMP TO LAUNCH PROBE OF LINCOLN SAVINGS 
</P>

Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp announced Monday that he intends to launch "a 
far-reaching, two-pronged civil and criminal investigation" into troubled 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to move ahead with a full-fledged investigation follows several 
months of congressional and legislative hearings into the events that led to a 
federal takeover of Lincoln last April following the collapse of the S&amp;L's 
parent company, American Continental Corp. Salvaging the Irvine-based Lincoln 
could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion -- making it the most expensive 
S&amp;L bailout in history. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Van de Kamp was asked by Assemblyman Patrick Johnston 
(D-Stockton) to investigate Lincoln. But the attorney general hesitated, citing 
a conflict between his role as the state's top prosecutor and his job as 
attorney for the state of California. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp described the conflict "as a delicate matter because of legal 
barriers against taking actions counter to a clients' interests." On the one 
hand, he has an obligation to prosecute possible government wrongdoers. But he 
may also have to defend the actions of the same individuals in a suit filed 
against the state and others by more than 22,000 customers of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
Those customers -- many of them Southern California retirees -- bought an 
estimated $250 million in American Continental bonds through the S&amp;L's 
branches. When the company entered bankruptcy proceedings, the bonds became 
virtually worthless. 
</P>
<P>
"My office is representing the California Department of Savings and Loan and 
the Department of Corporations in civil litigation where the state Treasury 
faces a potential liability of a quarter of a billion dollars," Van de Kamp 
said two weeks ago. At the same time, he noted that he had begun a criminal 
investigation into allegations that unlicensed employees of Lincoln had sold 
the bonds in violation of state law. 
</P>
<P>
Duane Peterson, a spokesman for Van de Kamp, said the attorney general will 
spell out the details of his investigation at a press conference today. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said that it took "lots of legal research and some innovative 
thinking" to resolve Van de Kamp's conflict-of-interest problem but that the 
issue had been resolved.

ON CALIFORNIA: WHEN SANTA KEPT A HOME IN CALIFORNIA

<TEXT>
<P>
Here's a story about Christmas in Southern California. I realize there are 
those who regard the phrase "Christmas in Southern California" as an oxymoron, 
believing that Christmas more or less fails to make an appearance here in 
paradise. I offer my story as evidence to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
In 1946 a man named Patrick McKeon rolled into Santa Barbara after his hitch in 
the war. His prospects were about as bright as you would expect for an 
ex-sailor with barely enough bankroll to open, say, a gas station. A lot of 
servicemen did just that after the war, but McKeon was more ambitious. He 
wanted to build a business that would leave a mark, that people would remember. 
</P>
<P>
He spotted an empty piece of land just south of Santa Barbara on the main 
highway to Los Angeles. A good piece of property, he thought, the only question 
being what to do with it. He needed a business idea, a high concept that would 
pull customers off the highway and into his establishment. 
</P>
<P>
During this period, other businessmen in Southern California were facing the 
same problem. The ubiquitous car with its potential customers sped by so fast 
that a curbside business had only a few seconds to deliver its message. Thus 
the world's largest doughnut got built near LAX and various restaurants sprang 
up in the shape of hot dogs and ice cream cones. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon's idea was equally spectacular, and it was destined to become one of the 
classics of auto-inspired architecture. But in McKeon's case, his inspiration 
would end up altering his life in ways he did not expect. McKeon decided to 
make his business a monument to Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, of course, life changes were not foreseen. McKeon and his 
brother opened a series of stores along their strip and then built, on the 
roof, the largest Santa Claus in the country. It was 25 feet tall and stood 
there in the dusty, subtropical sunlight, its right hand frozen in an eternal 
salute to the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Just why McKeon believed that people driving next to the Santa Barbara beach 
would be attracted to a gigantic Santa Claus is something of a mystery. And in 
truth, Santa initially flopped. In the first year, sales totaled $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
But then a discovery was made. McKeon learned that if you really got serious 
about Christmas, the customers would remember the stores and come back. They 
liked the feeling, and this being Southern California, it didn't seem to matter 
whether it was July or December. So McKeon began to operate the only stores in 
America based on the principle that Christmas should be observed year-round. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the sort of thing I mean. The brothers installed a loudspeaker inside 
the giant Santa that was connected to a microphone in the store. When they 
spotted a kid outside, his name would be quietly obtained from the parents and 
then Santa would start a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"Hello, Andy," Santa would say from his perch on the roof. "That's a nice a 
bathing suit you have on." 
</P>
<P>
Andy would look upward and become very still. "You know, Andy," Santa would 
say, "Christmas is only a few months away. Are you being good?" 
</P>
<P>
Andy, his eyes wide, would nod gravely. 
</P>
<P>
People loved it. Just like they loved the refrigerator-equipped North Pole that 
stood outside the store and stayed frosted all summer long. And they loved the 
small post office that postmarked letters, "Santa Claus, Calif." When kids to 
wrote to Santa, McKeon's sister always wrote back. 
</P>
<P>
The McKeons started to think of themselves as the keepers of Christmas. If the 
stores made their money by selling date shakes and turquoise jewelry, that 
didn't seem to matter to anyone. This was the 1950s and it was OK to be nutty 
about Christmas. In their own way, the McKeons became famous in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
It couldn't last, of course. There was a divorce, some lawsuits, and times 
simply changed. Pat McKeon eventually left Santa Claus and now operates a 
construction business in Santa Barbara. The new owners -- understandably, 
McKeon says -- have pretty much dropped the Christmas theme. The post office 
closed and for all intents Santa Claus, Calif., no longer exists. 
</P>
<P>
But the news isn't all bad. When the new owners applied for the permits needed 
to dismantle the gigantic Santa, they were turned down. It seems that Santa had 
been named a county landmark and was inviolate. So it will stay, McKeon says, a 
reminder of the good times, when Santa talked to kids in the summer heat, when 
letters got answers, when Southern California did Christmas its own way.

Actor Ed Asner, a former president of the Screen Actors Guild, testified Monday 
that state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya once asked for support in exchange for a vote 
on legislation affecting actors and recording artists. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to know what we were going to do for him," Asner told a federal jury 
during Montoya's political corruption trial. "I thought he was asking for a 
quid pro quo. . . . We do something for him and he'd do something for us, such 
as vote on the bill." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, former Montoya aide Karen Frick testified that the 
50-year-old lawmaker once put a "price tag" of $5,000 to carry two bills that 
would help foreign medical schools and their graduates seeking licenses in 
California.

And veteran lobbyist Dennis Carpenter, who once was a senator from Orange 
County, told the court that Montoya repeatedly asked him to obtain an 
honorarium from a recycling company that was affected by a Montoya bill. 
</P>
<P>
Asner, who had come to the state Capitol to lobby against a bill, said he was 
"angry and shocked" by Montoya's request for support during a private meeting 
in the senator's office. 
</P>
<P>
But on cross-examination, Asner acknowledged that Montoya never used the word 
"money" in asking for assistance. And the actor said his recollection of many 
of the details of his conversation with Montoya is now "fuzzy." 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to undercut Asner's testimony, the defense produced a photograph 
of a smiling Asner and Montoya with their arms draped over each other's 
shoulders. Asner agreed that the picture was taken immediately after his 
meeting with Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
Asner's account of the meeting, however, was corroborated by George Miller, a 
lobbyist for the Assn. of Talent Agents, who also was present. Miller told the 
jury he recalled Montoya saying, "You guys haven't done anything for me, why 
should I do anything for you?" 
</P>
<P>
Asner, star of television's "Lou Grant" and the "Mary Tyler Moore Show," 
testified that he came to Sacramento in May, 1985, to speak against legislation 
designed to extend the maximum length of contracts between recording companies 
and artists to 10 years. The Screen Actors Guild, which includes many 
performing artists among its members, opposed the bill, arguing that the 
10-year period was too long. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who was advising Asner on the bill, had identified Montoya as a swing 
vote at an upcoming hearing of the Senate Industrial Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of the hearing, Asner and Miller went to see Montoya in the 
senator's office. As the actor attempted to explain the guild's position, he 
testified, Montoya began asking what backing he had received from the actors' 
union. 
</P>
<P>
"The Screen Actors Guild had never done anything for him, what were they going 
to do for him," Asner recalled the senator saying. "He seemed to be somewhat 
agitated that we had never done anything for him." 
</P>
<P>
Both Asner and Miller testified that they interpreted Montoya's statement as a 
request for money and the conversation quickly grew heated. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, who took the witness stand after Asner, testified that the veteran 
actor "made a timeout gesture and said, 'You mean I have to pay for a vote?' " 
</P>
<P>
At one point in the conversation, Miller said, "I remember Mr. Asner commenting 
on the (legislative) system. As I remember, he said it stunk." 
</P>
<P>
Asner explained that he agreed to the impromptu photo session in the hope it 
might win Montoya's support for the guild's position. "Perhaps out of the 
goodness of his heart, my making a picture with someone would sway his vote," 
Asner told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, however, voted for the bill and against Asner. The measure by Sen. 
Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena) later passed the Legislature but was vetoed by Gov. 
George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination by defense attorney Bruce Kelton, Asner acknowledged he 
had difficulty remembering some details of the meeting but clearly recalled how 
angry he was at Montoya's request. 
</P>
<P>
"Functions, dates, people are all fuzzy," Asner said. "I only remember 
emotions." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure you remember your lines," Kelton responded. 
</P>
<P>
"Only when I have too," Asner said. 
</P>
<P>
Kelton also questioned whether Montoya had explained that he was forced to vote 
for the bill because it had the backing of powerful Democratic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
But Asner said he did not recall Montoya ever making such a statement. " 'What 
was the guild going to do for him' seemed to be the exact language," Asner 
said. " 'What's the guild going to do for me?' " 
</P>
<P>
Miller testified that once they arrived at the committee meeting room, Montoya 
handed Asner a business card with the handwritten message, "Ed, hope there's no 
hard feelings. Love you, Joe." 
</P>
<P>
Former Senate aide Frick said the committee Montoya chaired had a reputation as 
"a juice committee" -- one that generated large campaign contributions for its 
members. 
</P>
<P>
Frick said she and another consultant to Montoya's Senate Business and 
Professions Committee were approached by a lobbyist representing foreign 
medical schools. The lobbyist wanted Montoya to sponsor bills making it easier 
for foreign graduates to be licensed to practice in California, she said. 
</P>
<P>
When the aides took the request to Montoya, according to Frick, "he said he 
would do that but that there was a price to pay for the bills. . . . I recall a 
$5,000 figure." Frick testified that Montoya emphasized that she and the other 
aide were expected to convey the request to the medical schools' lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
Frick said that on 10 or more occasions she remembered Montoya saying that 
"people have to pay their dues" or "pay up" if they expected his support in the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
After working for Montoya for two years, Frick said, she was fired. Her job was 
taken by Amiel A. Jaramillo, who had earlier made it clear to her that "he was 
going to be taking an aggressive role in raising campaign contributions." She 
said Jaramillo -- who has been charged with four counts of political corruption 
in a related case -- urged the staff to "kick ass and get people to pay their 
dues to Joe." 
</P>
<P>
Lobbyist Carpenter said he had urged his client, Allan Co., not to pay 
honorariums to legislators. But Carpenter said that Montoya raised the issue 
"five or six times" in a matter of only a few weeks. Finally, when Allan Co. 
executives agreed to pay Montoya $2,000 for speaking to a recycling 
organization, Carpenter said it was "all right with me." 
</P>
<P>
But Carpenter said the speech was canceled in August, 1988, when the FBI raided 
the offices of several legislators, including Montoya, and the senator never 
received the $2,000.

President Bush on Monday wished the nation a joyous Hanukkah and a Merry 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
To Jews, who begin celebrating the eight days of Hanukkah at sundown Friday, 
Bush recalled that the holiday commemorates a great victory won by the Jewish 
Maccabees in their struggle for religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, as Jews around the world pause to observe this festival, all of us 
can share in the joy of those people who are just beginning to enjoy success in 
their own struggle for freedom and self-determination," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
He told Christians that the promise of the first Christmas continues to give a 
sense of peace and purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"It is daily acts of goodness and generosity, performed time and time again 
throughout the year, that hold the true meaning of this holy season," Bush 
said.

FBI FACES PROBE ON SALVADOR TESTIMONY

<P>
A congressional subcommittee will investigate whether FBI agents intimidated a 
Salvadoran woman and caused her to recant earlier statements she had made, 
linking elements of El Salvador's armed forces to last month's murders of six 
Jesuit priests in San Salvador, it was learned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The civil and constitutional rights subcommittee of the House Judiciary 
Committee plans to examine complaints from U.S. Jesuit officials and a lawyers 
committee that Lucia Barrera de Cerna was "harassed, intimidated and insulted" 
during FBI interrogation in Miami -- to the point that she changed her earlier 
sworn statements about what she had witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
California Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), the subcommittee chairman, and Jim 
Dempsey, its chief counsel, refused to discuss the matter other than to 
acknowledge their intended inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department officials and a spokesman for the State Department, 
meanwhile, said the questioning of Cerna and her husband by two FBI agents and 
a representative of El Salvador's army was proper. 
</P>
<P>
Cerna, the principal witness, her husband Jorge and their daughter were flown 
to Miami with diplomatic protection after the Nov. 16 killings so that Cerna 
could be questioned in safety about her statements that she had seen armed men 
in Salvadoran army-type camouflage uniforms at the time of the pre-dawn 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
But after three days of questioning, Cerna changed her original story, saying 
she heard gunfire but saw nothing. She and her family now are living in a 
secret location in the United States under the care of American Jesuits. 
</P>
<P>
Both Cerna and her husband failed an FBI-administered lie-detector test after 
they changed their original testimony, authorities said. There was no 
explanation as to why the polygraph was not given earlier. 
</P>
<P>
David Runkel, a top assistant to Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, said the FBI 
interviews were reviewed by department officials last week after Archbishop 
Arturo Rivera y Damas, the Roman Catholic primate of El Salvador, complained 
that the United States was subjecting Cerna to brainwashing and "psychological 
torment." 
</P>
<P>
"People within the department are satisfied that the entire process was 
conducted in a proper fashion," Runkel said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the FBI is providing additional support for the Salvadoran police 
investigation of the killings. The investigation was ordered by President 
Alfredo Cristiani, whom the United States is supporting in a war against 
leftist guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Tutwiler, briefing reporters at the State Department, said a 
department representative attended all the sessions at which the Cernas were 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
"We absolutely and unequivocally deny any allegation that U.S. officials 
mistreated the witness," Tutwiler said. 
</P>
<P>
A report by the Lawyers Committee on Human Rights said Cerna changed her story 
only because she was "frightened and intimidated by the harsh manner" of the 
questioning. The report was given to reporters by R. Scott Greathead, an 
officer and first assistant attorney general of New York state. 
</P>
<P>
Father Paul S. Tipton, president of the Assn. of Jesuit Colleges and 
Universities, endorsed findings in the committee's report. 
</P>
<P>
The report added that Jorge Cerna, after first supporting his wife's story, 
also recanted his account under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"Like most Salvadorans who have witnessed crimes implicating the military or 
security forces . . , he has a natural distrust of government investigators," 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the House subcommittee's probe of Cerna's treatment, a task force 
appointed by House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) will investigate all 
aspects of the killings.

RIVALS TRY TO FLAG DOWN PANAMA SHIP BUSINESS;

COMMERCE: WITH U.S. PORTS OFF-LIMITS TO VESSELS FROM NORIEGA'S NATION, OTHER

<P>
The U.S. ban on Panamanian-registered ships in U.S. ports has set off what one 
shipping specialist calls "a feeding frenzy" in flag-of-convenience countries 
such as this small island nation that are anxious to pick up the registrations 
that Panama loses. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's pushing, and their tactics are very aggressive," said Lawrence I. 
Brown, a Greenwich, Conn., attorney who specializes in ship registrations for 
Liberia and the tiny Pacific island nation of Vanuatu. "I feel like I should be 
sending royalty checks to Noriega." 
</P>
<P>
The ban, announced by President George Bush as he departed for the Malta summit 
early this month, is to take effect after Jan. 31. It was designed as a 
significant addition to the economic arsenal that Washington has deployed 
against Panama's strongman, Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, who has been indicted in 
the United States on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
Until the U.S. port ban, Panama rivaled Liberia as the world's leading flag of 
convenience. Registrations netted the Panamanian government about $50 million 
annually in fees and taxes, and U.S. officials estimate that Noriega and his 
cronies took another $40 million in bribes and kickbacks. They said the ban 
affects 1,500 or more of the 6,121 ships registered in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the two countries that he represents probably will pick up more than 
400 of the registrations as owners of ships flying the Panamanian flag scurry 
to acquire safe, new flags before the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Although it stunned many shipowners, Bush's announcement prompted countries 
such as the Bahamas, a relative newcomer to open shipping registry, to move as 
if a starter's gun had sounded. Today, a little more than two weeks later, it 
appears that the quick marketing campaigns are paying off for the dozen or so 
open registry countries now aggressively grabbing for the Panamanian ships. 
</P>
<P>
Bahamas Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling said that as soon as the ban was 
announced, he personally called several cruise lines that regularly sail in 
Caribbean and Bahamian waters, urging them to shift from Panamanian to Bahamian 
registry. 
</P>
<P>
"We said to the world's shipowners, 'Come check us out,' " the prime minister 
said, frankly acknowledging his hard-sell campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Pindling spoke glowingly of the Bahamas' windfall during a showy news 
conference with Carnival Cruise Lines held at Carnival's elaborate Crystal 
Palace resort here last week. The news conference announced the Bahamian 
re-registration of four of the lines' biggest ships that until now have flown 
the Panamanian flag. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Alan L. Morris, who operates out of London as director of maritime 
affairs and registrar for Bahamian shipping, said the Carnival registrations 
were only a small part of the more than 150 ships now flying the Panama flag 
that he expects to re-register in the Bahamas before the U.S. ban takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
According to James Lawrence, publisher of shipping newsletter International 
Ship Registry, a number of other small countries new to open registry shipping 
also are enjoying a windfall from the U.S. port ban. He cited, in particular, 
St. Vincent and the Grenadines, an island nation in the Caribbean, and the 
Marshall Islands in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"The Marshalls more than doubled their fleet overnight," Lawrence said. He 
cited the move to the Marshalls last week of 13 Panama-registered ships of 
Evergreen Marine Corp., the world's largest container line. 
</P>
<P>
The richest targets are Japanese and Hong Kong Chinese shipowners, said Philip 
Loree, chairman of the Federation of American-Controlled Ships, a lobbying 
group of U.S. owners of ships registered in Panama, Liberia and the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is the leading nation on the Panamanian registry, with 1,388 
Panama-flagged ships, and Hong Kong is second, according to the Journal of 
Commerce, which has been watching the re-registry scramble closely. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the open registry countries) are scurrying all over Japan looking for 
business," said Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Loree and other shipping specialists agreed that the clear winner in the 
marketing race is Liberia, which Loree said stands to pick up more than 300 of 
an expected total of 1,000 to 1,500 Panama re-flaggings. 
</P>
<P>
"According to what I call the 'pond theory,' when you look out the window from 
Japan you see Panama first, then you see Liberia," Loree joked. He explained 
that the two are the oldest of the flag-of-convenience countries, both 
established by the United States. Thus, they are far more experienced in 
handling registrations and offering political support for their fleets. With 
the squeeze on Panama, it is natural that Liberia will take up the biggest 
share of the slack, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Panamanian maritime lawyers and officials involved in ship registry 
have been quick to cooperate with the besieged shipowners who must change flags 
to continue calling on U.S. ports, Loree said. "They're doing everything to 
create and keep good will in the hope that when this is all over, the 
shipowners will remember and come back." 
</P>
<P>
Another irony, according to Loree, is that the Panamanian marine lawyers who 
are most hurt by the U.S. ban are almost universally opposed to Noriega. 
"Noriega's bank account isn't going to suffer," he said, expressing doubt that 
the ban adds any significant pressure on the strongman to step down. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, the ship registry attorney, sardonically agreed. "If Noriega is dealing 
drugs as people say, and he loses $50 million or $60 million on this, he can 
always run another plane load of cocaine to make it up."

</P>
<P>
CZECHOSLOVAKIA: THE COUP REPORT IS LAID TO AN 'ENTIRELY IRRESPONSIBLE CAMPAIGN' 
ATTEMPTING 'TO CREATE PANIC.' STILL, SOME STRANGE THINGS ARE HAPPENING . . . .

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than a week, this has been a city in celebration, but in recent days 
the festivities have taken on a strong undertone of nervousness. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, for example, the Ministry of Defense felt compelled to issue a 
nationally broadcast statement denying widespread rumors of an impending coup. 
</P>
<P>
An "entirely irresponsible leaflet campaign," centering on the provincial city 
of Brno, has talked about a coup in an attempt "to create panic," Defense 
Ministry spokesman Col. Stanislav Pohorel said. "The army command strongly 
dissociates itself from such actions and rejects the accusation," he added. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Civic Forum opposition leader and presidential candidate 
Vaclav Havel broadcast a statement warning of strange "emissaries" who have 
visited military units. He urged soldiers to listen to their commanders and not 
these "various messengers, whatever their motives." 
</P>
<P>
Other rumors involve tales of mysterious car accidents, missing persons and 
assaults on a young man who was allegedly accosted by three men in civilian 
clothes, beaten and left on a railroad track. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the rumors are unverifiable, but they are widely believed. Together 
with the lingering scars from the brutal suppression of the 1968 reform 
movement here, the rumors have had a very real effect on political 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
Involved is what Czechoslovaks refer to -- often in hushed tones -- as "temne 
sily," the dark forces. And there are enough verifiable incidents to make clear 
that the continued presence of "dark forces" is not just a product of fevered 
imaginations. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 4 a.m. Monday morning, for example, a Western newspaper 
correspondent here was awakened by the sound of someone opening his hotel room 
door with a key. A few minutes later, an unidentified man walked in, only to 
run out when the reporter asked what he was doing. American Embassy officials 
say that a U.S. diplomat here recently had the same experience. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't prove it's the secret police, but we assume so," a diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Other Western diplomats have reported returning to their homes at the end of 
the day to find one or two pieces of furniture moved, just enough to make the 
intrusion noticeable. Such incidents have declined somewhat in recent weeks, 
but they have not disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last four weeks, the opposition has succeeded in removing from power 
the people for whose benefit the Czechoslovak police state was run. But the 
state apparatus itself remains. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the democracy movement concede that the new government, in office 
only one week, has not yet been able to bring under control the nation's 
security forces -- most importantly the Statnibezbecnost, or STB, as the secret 
police here are known. 
</P>
<P>
Student demonstrators have taken "Abolish the STB" as one of their favorite 
slogans. But "we cannot push that institution too fast," cautions Jan 
Carnogursky, a first deputy prime minister and the senior non-Communist member 
of the government. 
</P>
<P>
And until the STB and similar bodies are brought under the control of the law, 
Carnogursky and others say, an open election campaign remains impossible. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Civic Forum and its allies have had to adopt undemocratic tactics 
to ensure the transformation to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The new government, for example, was hammered out in deals worked out behind 
closed doors and pushed into power by the strength of massive street 
demonstrations that intimidated the old Communist regime into resigning. There 
is little doubt that the government more closely reflects the popular will than 
the Communists did. But there is also no claim that the government was freely 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
Today, student leaders plan to use the same pressure tactics, running special 
trains to bring thousands of students here from around the country to 
demonstrate in front of the Federal Assembly, the Parliament, to force deputies 
to vote soon to make Havel president. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders say they have no choice, given the continued strength of the 
other side. "If we adhered strictly to the forms of the constitution, we could 
be wiped out," Carnogursky said in a recent conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Forum leaders, most notably Havel himself, devote considerable time in 
their speeches to urging their listeners not be be afraid. 
</P>
<P>
But fear -- or at least concern -- was a major factor in the negotiations 
leading to the formation of the new government, Civic Forum officials say. A 
prime worry was how to devise a way to control the police that would not lead 
its forces to "mutiny." 
</P>
<P>
The resulting compromise has left the country in a strange limbo. Carnogursky 
and Prime Minister Marian Calfa oversee the Interior Ministry, but no minister 
has been appointed to head that ministry, which controls the security forces. 
</P>
<P>
Prague's main squares and hotel lobbies still are ringed with surveillance 
cameras, but no one is sure whether they are still monitored. 
</P>
<P>
State television has broadcast several reports about new restrictions being 
placed on telephone tapping, but it has also shown Interior Ministry officials 
defending the practice. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, mail is no longer being opened. But in practice, Czechoslovaks who 
want to send political material to relatives in the West still often ask 
travelers to take the sparcels out of the country for them. 
</P>
<P>
"We are happy," said one young Czech woman after making such a request of an 
American visitor. "But we remember our past. We cannot afford to be euphoric."

SURVEY FINDS WHITE STUDENTS MORE APT TO ABUSE DRUGS

<P>
A drug-use survey of students nationwide found that white high school seniors 
are more apt to abuse drugs than black seniors, according to figures released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes against conventional wisdom -- particularly television has portrayed 
the problem of drug abuse in the United States as a black, inner-city problem," 
said Doug Hall, vice president of the national Parents' Resource Institute for 
Drug Education Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta-based PRIDE surveyed 296,180 white students and 59,898 black students 
in grades 6-12 at 958 schools in 38 states during the 1988-89 school year, 
including students in inner city areas in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, 
New York and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is keeping teen-agers in school," PRIDE co-founder Marsha Keith 
Schuchard said in a statement. "Black students who stay in school have 
significantly fewer drug and alcohol problems." 
</P>
<P>
The focus on inner-city drug use by blacks "feeds the increasing expressions of 
racism that surface daily in our country," she said at a news conference 
announcing the survey results. 
</P>
<P>
"The preoccupation with blacks and crack also misleads white parents into 
underestimating the temptations and dangers their teens face from the 
multibillion-dollar drug culture." 
</P>
<P>
Judge Reggie Walton, associate director of the Office of National Drug Control 
Policy, called drugs an American problem. 
</P>
<P>
"For all too long, this problem has been portrayed as a black problem, and I 
think the end result has been that there are some people who have not really 
cared a lot about it because of that," he said. "This is an American problem, 
not just a black problem." 
</P>
<P>
The survey found that "black students find cocaine about twice as available as 
white students, but they use cocaine less than white students, by a substantial 
amount," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
About 15% of black students overall said cocaine was easy to get, compared with 
8% of white students who responded that way, he said, noting that cocaine 
referred to both the powder and its smokable derivative, crack. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the 12th grade, in which some 40,000 students were surveyed, only 
4% of the black students said they had used cocaine at least once in the 
previous year, while 7% of white students said they had done so.

Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Monday that he has waived Israeli law and 
allowed the families of missing Israeli soldiers to visit PLO officials in 
Tunis in order to locate the servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
"I authorized the families to meet with the PLO, even for someone from the 
families to travel to (PLO headquarters in) Tunisia, because I thought that in 
this matter there are no conditions," Rabin told the Labor Party student 
faction at Tel Aviv University. 
</P>
<P>
Under Israeli law, contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization are 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The defense minister said the military is doing everything possible to locate 
and obtain the release of missing soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to receive information for the families it is allowed to meet without 
any conditions or limits whatsoever, also at our expense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Six Israeli soldiers are listed as missing and one captured. On Sunday, an army 
spokesman said that captured air force navigator Ron Arad is being held by Iran 
or pro-Iranian militias in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin's revelation comes amid increasing reports that Israeli officials have 
had indirect contacts with the PLO and that the government has chosen to 
overlook political meetings between Palestinians from the occupied territories 
and PLO officials. 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, military officials confirmed that Jewish settlers in the Gaza 
Strip have vandalized homes being built by Palestinians from Egypt. Under the 
Camp David agreement, several thousand Palestinians from a refugee camp in 
Egypt will be allowed to move to the town of Rafah in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which is intended to reunite families, the Palestinians 
are allowed to build homes in Rafah before moving there. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlers in Gaza have vowed that they will not cease their activities 
until the transfer of Palestinians from Egypt is stopped. The Gaza Settlers 
Committee announced that settlers have damaged the walls and foundations of two 
houses under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians angered by the settlers' actions clashed with Israeli soldiers in 
Rafah, and at least nine Palestinians were shot and wounded in the violence, 
Palestinian sources said. 
</P>
<P>
In both the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, residents observed a 
general strike. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, for the first time in the two-year-old Palestinian uprising, police 
have charged journalists with entering an area declared closed by the military, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The charges were brought against three Israeli reporters -- Joel Greenberg of 
the English-language Jerusalem Post, Ori Nir of Haaretz and Oren Cohen of 
Hadashot. 
</P>
<P>
Shaul Naim, police prosecutor, said the three will not be jailed during legal 
proceedings but could be sentenced to up to two years in prison if convicted of 
the charges. He said he is uncertain when the trial will be held. 
</P>
<P>
During the uprising, soldiers have regularly blocked reporters from entering 
troubled towns or villages by declaring them closed military areas. While 
reporters have been detained several times for entering such areas, no charges 
had been brought.

S. AFRICA JUDGE OVERRULES POLICE, FREES SUSPECT IN ASSASSINATIONS

A judge Monday overruled police investigators and ordered the release of a 
former policeman detained in the assassination of two white left-wing 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
Police had opposed the release of Calla Botha, saying there was evidence 
linking him to a right-wing group responsible for political assassinations. 
</P>
<P>
But Johannesburg Supreme Court Justice J. C. Kriegler granted an application 
filed by Botha's father, a retired police colonel, seeking release of his son. 
Kriegler said there was insufficient evidence connecting Botha to death squads. 
</P>
<P>
Botha was detained without charge on Nov. 30 as part of an investigation into 
the assassinations of David Webster, a university lecturer and human rights 
activist, and Anton Lubowski, the only white officeholder in Namibia's main 
independence movement, the South-West Africa People's Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Both were shot outside their homes -- Webster in Johannesburg on May 1 and 
Lubowski in Windhoek, Namibia, on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
In a court affidavit last week, police Brig. Floris Mostert described Botha as 
the "handler" for Donald Acheson, who is being held in Windhoek awaiting trial 
for Lubowski's murder. 
</P>
<P>
Another former policeman, Ferdinand Barnard, is still in custody in 
Johannesburg on the case. Mostert said Botha and Barnard were held briefly in 
June after they were uncovered monitoring the movements of one of Webster's 
activist colleagues.

JUDGE SETS LIMITS ON IMELDA MARCOS' SPENDING; 
</P>
<P>
FRAUD SUIT: SHE MUST HAVE APPROVAL FOR OUTLAYS EXCEEDING $10,000. THE ORDER IS 
A MAJOR VICTORY FOR THE PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT IN ACTION SEEKING TO RECOVER $5 
BILLION. 
</P>

The Philippine government, seeking to recover billions of dollars allegedly 
stolen from the country by its late president, Ferdinand E. Marcos and his 
wife, Imelda, won a major victory Monday when a Los Angeles federal judge 
placed new spending restraints on the former first lady. 
</P>
<P>
Under the order by U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer, Imelda Marcos will 
have to seek court approval of any expenditure exceeding $10,000, except for 
the payment of attorneys fees and court costs. She will also have to report any 
loan exceeding $10,000 and must file a monthly report with the court detailing 
expenditures and accounting for all loans or gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Pfaelzer acted on motions by lawyers for the Philippine government who, in a 
massive civil fraud suit, are trying to recover $5 billion the Marcoses 
allegedly looted from the island nation. 
</P>
<P>
Ferdinand Marcos, who fled the Philippines in 1986 after Corazon Aquino was 
elected president, died in exile in Honolulu on Sept. 28 after a long illness. 
</P>
<P>
When the Los Angeles suit was filed in June, 1986, Pfaelzer issued a freeze on 
the Marcoses' assets worldwide, pending trial. 
</P>
<P>
In October, attorneys Alan D. Bersin and Michael R. Doyen of the Los Angeles 
firm of Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson asserted in court papers that the Marcoses 
and several of their business associates had violated the freeze on many 
occasions. The attorneys, in urging the court to impose further restraints, 
alleged in voluminous documents that the violations included transfers of 
properties the Marcoses owned in New York and Hawaii and manipulation of 
various foreign bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"You've certainly made a good showing that the original order was violated," 
Pfaelzer said in granting the motion Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers asserted that the Marcoses "fraudulently transferred" to Saudi arms 
merchant Adnan Khashoggi ownership and control of two New York buildings, four 
related corporations and at least one Swiss bank account in excess of $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The motion asserted that documents were illegally back-dated in an attempt to 
transfer the Marcoses' holdings to Khashoggi while getting around Pfaelzer's 
1986 injunction. 
</P>
<P>
The court papers filed in October also alleged that the Marcoses violated the 
injunction by spending $2.8 million and encumbering an additional $200 million 
in their Swiss bank accounts to purchase arms for a planned invasion of the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
The court papers further asserted that the Marcoses violated the injunction by 
transferring ownership of their large Honolulu home to a corporation in 
England. 
</P>
<P>
Also named in the civil racketeering case against the Marcoses are Khashoggi 
and others, including Robert Benedicto, a major shareholder in a California 
bank. Benedicto is a fugitive from similar, but criminal, charges in New York. 
</P>
<P>
The New York indictment, issued in October, 1988, alleges that the Marcoses, 
Khashoggi, Benedicto, six others and California Overseas Bank engaged in a 
massive racketeering scheme of fraud, embezzlement, bribery and obstruction of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
Richard A. Hibey, Imelda Marcos' Washington-based lawyer, opposed tightening 
the Los Angeles injunction on several grounds. He asserted that the alleged 
violations occurred some time ago and that he should be allowed to 
cross-examine some of the individuals who had filed written declarations in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Hibey also contended that, if his client were ordered to file monthly reports, 
it would violate her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, because 
such a ruling would require her to provide information that could be used 
against her in a New York criminal fraud case set for trial in March. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the allegations in that case are similar to the charges in the civil 
case in Los Angeles. Both cases describe elaborate money-laundering schemes, 
secret bank accounts in Switzerland, Hong Kong, Panama and other places, and 
falsified documents designed to thwart investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Hibey said the New York case alleges that there is no amount of money that 
Imelda Marcos possesses that does not belong to the Philippine government. 
Therefore, he said, any information she would provide in monthly reports to the 
Los Angeles court could be used against her in the New York case. 
</P>
<P>
Pfaelzer rejected the argument. The judge did, however, modify the original 
proposal of he Philippine government, which would have required Imelda Marcos 
to seek approval for any expenditure exceeding $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
Hibey said he was "not surprised" by Pfaelzer's decision, which could not be 
appealed at this stage of the case. 
</P>
<P>
Bersin, one of the lawyers for the Philippines, called Pfaelzer's ruling "a 
very important step forward" in the country's efforts to regain funds it claims 
the Marcoses stole. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider it a very important indication by the court that Mrs. Marcos 
can't, with impunity, ignore the freeze order" issued by Pfaelzer in June, 
1986, "with regard to assets the Philippines claims. It should have a 
prophylactic effect." 
</P>
<P>
If Marcos violates Pfaelzer's new order, she could be fined up to $1 million 
for each violation. Hibey argued, to no avail, that the penalty would be 
excessive. 
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Commission on Good Government has been conducting an extensive 
search to find assets it claims the Marcoses and their associates stole. 
</P>
<P>
Bersin said Monday, "I can state with certainty we don't know where all the 
assets are. . . . The Philippine government is aware of substantial bank 
accounts in Switzerland and property in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Trial in the Los Angeles case will not begin until the New York matter is 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the civil racketeering charges, the Los Angeles suit alleges 
that the Marcoses stole money from government-owned financial institutions, 
converted to their own use foreign aid money designed to benefit Filipino 
citizens and engaged in illegal money-laundering to conceal the funds from 
authorities.

QUAKE RELIEF IS WORKING WELL, GOVERNOR SAYS

Gov. George Deukmejian donned a hard hat Monday and took a look at recovery 
efforts in three cities hit hard by the Oct. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
In Watsonville, Hollister and Santa Cruz, Deukmejian viewed the remains of 
damaged buildings and toured temporary quarters established for residents and 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased with everything I've seen," Deukmejian said. "Everybody seems 
to be adjusting as well as could be expected." 
</P>
<P>
The governor repeated his pledge to do whatever is necessary to help the 
quake-stricken area return to normal as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he does not believe there is a need now for more than the $800 
million that will be raised by a 13-month quarter-cent increase in the sales 
tax enacted by the Legislature in a special session. But he said the 
legislative package needed to be "fine-tuned" to better meet the needs of the 
quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
In Watsonville, Deukmejian met with a dozen local officials from the region and 
then visited a just-opened temporary shopping center in the downtown business 
district. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Cruz, Deukmejian walked through the devastated Pacific Garden Mall and 
watched as a giant backhoe tore away at the steel and concrete innards of a 
building too badly damaged to be saved. Mayor Mardi Wormhoudt showed him the 
evacuated St. George Hotel, which has 85 units that before the quake housed 
low-income elderly people. 
</P>
<P>
"These are people who are least able to compete in the housing market," she 
said. "They were hanging on to their independence tenaciously but just by a 
thread." 
</P>
<P>
The governor finished the first day of his two-day swing in Hollister, where he 
heard a pitch from local tomato canners who would like the state to buy dented 
canned goods that they cannot sell. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Weller, a representative of San Benito Foods, said the processors are still 
sorting through tens of millions of cans that fell in the quake. They hope to 
sell the dented ones to the state for use in prisons or other institutions.

USE OF DETROIT POLICE FUNDS PROBED;

<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: INQUIRY SEEKS TO DETERMINE IF MONEY WAS SPENT TO PAY RENT ON 
POSH BEVERLY HILLS HOME FOR CHIEF'S DAUGHTER.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a widening scandal that has rocked the Detroit Police Department, federal 
investigators are probing whether cash from a million-dollar secret police fund 
earmarked for narcotics investigations went to pay the rent on the posh Beverly 
Hills home of the daughter of Detroit's police chief. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent diversion occured at a time when Detroit police were so short of 
cash that undercover officers were paying for street-level buys of crack 
cocaine out of their own pockets. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal has become a major embarrassment for a city suffering under a 
plague of drug-related crime, where residents often complain about the police's 
inability to rid their neighborhoods of crack houses and drug-dealing gangs. 
</P>
<P>
A mounting public outcry over the case has led several City Council members to 
call for the suspension of Police Chief William Hart, who has already had 
control of the secret fund taken from him by Detroit Mayor Coleman A. Young. 
</P>
<P>
That action came in the wake of allegations that Hart's daughter had $72,000 in 
rent paid over two years on her Beverly Hills home by companies controlled by 
the mysterious central figure in the scandal, Kenneth Weiner, a former civilian 
deputy chief of police in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Weiner's California-based companies had contracts with the Detroit police that 
were paid out of the secret drug-purchase fund. 
</P>
<P>
Hart has denied knowing anything about Weiner's rent payments for his daughter, 
and city officials say it is still not clear whether any money from the 
drug-purchase fund went for the rent payments. But investigators for the FBI 
and the Internal Revenue Service, working with a federal grand jury, are now 
trying to determine exactly what happened to the money from the secret fund, 
and are trying to track down the elusive Weiner. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal has received so much attention in the Detroit media that Stephen 
Markman, the U.S. attorney for Detroit, took the unusual step last week of 
acknowledging the existence of a federal investigation into the case. 
</P>
<P>
"The circumstances of the investigation surrounding the Detroit Police 
Department have been extraordinary," Markman said, in explaining why his office 
confirmed its probe. 
</P>
<P>
A former college professor and reputed expert on anti-terrorism, Weiner served 
as a civilian anti-terrorism expert for the Detroit police until 1986, when a 
federal investigation of his allegedly questionable investment activities in 
suburban Detroit forced him to resign, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Hart and Mayor Young are now seeking to distance themselves from Weiner, and 
agreed Monday night to turn over checks and other financial records from the 
secret fund that the Detroit City Council had demanded for its own 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Young has refused to take Hart off active duty during the investigation. "The 
Mayor still stands by Chief Hart," Bob Berg, Young's spokesman, said. "There 
has been a lot of innuendo, but you are presumed innocent until you are proven 
guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Young blasted the local media's coverage of the police probe last week, 
charging that it amounted to a "crucifixion" of Hart. On Monday, an 
organization of black Detroit police officers also gave their backing to Hart, 
charging that he had been treated unfairly by the press. 
</P>
<P>
But Young's critics on the City Council believe that the police department 
cannot conduct an adequate internal investigation while Hart remains on the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"I would prefer that Chief Hart step aside until this investigation is 
complete," said Mel Ravitz, a City Council member. "I think keeping him on just 
raises more questions." 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials say that the worst aspect of the case is that funds 
from the secret fund were apparently flowing to Weiner at a time when narcotics 
investigations on the streets of Detroit were sometimes forced to come to a 
virtual standstill because of a lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
In some instances last spring and summer, crews of narcotics investigators sat 
idle, despite rampant drug dealing throughout the city, because they could not 
afford any undercover work.

MORE MIDWEST COLD RECORDS FALL AS SLEET, ICE PLAGUE DEEP SOUTH 
</P>

<TEXT>

A Canadian delivery of sleet and ice sledded into the Deep South on Monday in a 
winter preview that cracked century-old temperature records across the Midwest 
and clogged the Missouri River with a 75-mile ice jam. 
</P>
<P>
The bitter weather closed schools from Mississippi to Michigan, and forecasters 
said that no change was in sight. The cold is being caused by a 
horseshoe-shaped flow of air that follows the West Coast up to Alaska, chills 
and plunges down through Canada into the East and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Southerners from central Mississippi to the Carolinas awoke Monday to a vista 
of freezing rain and sleet that made driving hazardous and was blamed for at 
least one traffic death. Hundreds of schools were closed. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said as much as an inch of sleet and freezing rain 
covered north and central Georgia before dawn, and freezing rain extended as 
far south as Savannah. 
</P>
<P>
At least 19 deaths around the nation were blamed on the cold during the 
weekend, including the deaths of two young Tulsa, Okla., girls who apparently 
were playing with a makeshift sled Sunday when they plunged through thin ice on 
a lake. Two homeless people died of hypothermia while sleeping in New York City 
subway stations. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's cold broke Dec. 18 records that had held for more than a century in 
Columbus, Ohio, where it was minus 7; in Pittsburgh, Pa., where it also was 
minus 7, and in Detroit, where it was minus 3. 
</P>
<P>
Other records included Parkersburg, W. Va., at 4 above, Cincinnati at 3 below, 
Ft. Wayne, Ind., and Cleveland at minus 5, and Youngstown, Ohio, at minus 8. 
</P>
<P>
The Missouri River turned to ice for about a 75-mile stretch between Blair, 
Neb., north of Omaha, and Sioux City, Iowa, according to the National Weather 
Service. Officials feared that the ice floe could cause problems for 
communities that pump their water from the river. 
</P>
<P>
In St. Joseph, Mo., officials activated a new emergency pump as a precautionary 
measure to keep water flowing to the city.

Congresswoman Intervenes on Air Force Plan: The Air Force's secret plan to move 
the Ballistic Systems Division out of San Bernardino, which was disclosed in a 
Times story last month, has not been well received on Capitol Hill. Rep. Pat 
Schroeder (D-Colo.), chairwoman of the House subcommittee on military 
installations and facilities, has sent a letter to Air Force Secretary Donald 
Rice warning that the service lacks the authority to make the move. Schroeder 
also termed as "irresponsible" an Air Force memorandum that laid out a legal 
argument to get around a law requiring the division to stay at its current 
location.

Mattel to Acquire Corgi Toys: The Hawthorne company said it will acquire Corgi 
Toys Ltd., a British concern that produces miniature cars and models, for an 
undisclosed price. The announcement comes two weeks after Mattel, which will 
sell more than $1 billion worth of toys this year, reported strong revenue for 
the Christmas season with a continuation of 1989's 25% sales growth. Corgi has 
annual revenue of about $20 million.

MARRIOTT TO SELL ITS RESTAURANTS, FOCUS ON HOTELS; 
</P>
<P>
SERVICES: TOUGH COMPETITION PROMPTED THE HOTEL GIANT'S DECISION TO SELL OFF ITS 
FAST-FOOD AND FAMILY-STYLE EATERY CHAINS, INCLUDING BOB'S BIG BOY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Marriott Corp., unable to gain ground in the restaurant industry, on Monday 
said it would place family-style eateries like Bob's Big Boy and its fast-food 
operations on the sales block and focus on hotel expansion. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based hotel chain said it is holding discussions with a 
potential buyer for the entire 600-outlet Roy Rogers fast-food chain. Company 
officials said Marriott is also seeking bidders for its 430 family restaurant 
units -- including Bob's Big Boy, Allie's, Jolly Roger, Wag's, Bickford's and 
Howard Johnson's -- properties it may be willing to sell on a piecemeal basis. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Marriott's Bob's Big Boy restaurants -- 140 of 235 -- are in 
California. The company also has 17 Allie's and seven Jolly Roger units in the 
state. The other Marriott-owned restaurants are on the East Coast and in the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said the sales plan is part of a wide-scale restructuring designed 
to reposition and streamline the company. Marriott is looking for ways to cut 
costs but has no immediate layoff plans. Many analysts, citing sizzling 
competition in food service, said Marriott was forced to choose between the two 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Marriott) know hotels, and hotels are typically more profitable," said 
Janet Lowder, manager of restaurant and food service consulting at the Los 
Angeles regional offices of Laventhol &amp; Horwath, an accounting firm. 
"Marriott is strong in the hotel industry but is not a dominant force in the 
restaurant industry." 
</P>
<P>
Competing against giants like McDonald's, Burger King and Denny's, Marriott 
decided to check out of the restaurant industry partly because it could not 
make significant market share gains, said Robert T. Souers, a company 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"In the (fast food) restaurant segment, the national players have too much of a 
head start," Souers said. "In the family restaurant segment, there is more and 
more competition. We thought the effort and resources needed to compete would 
be better spent elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the company's resources and attention will be focused on an ambitious 
hotel expansion plan, Souers said. Marriott now operates 530 hotels and motels 
under the names Marriott, Marriott Suites, Residence Inn, Courtyard and 
Fairfield Inn. Marriott Chairman J.W. Marriott Jr. has recently said the 
company aims to double the number of hotels in the chain by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott, in a statement, predicted that the company's profits will grow 15% to 
20% per year as a result of the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
The prediction is realistic, said Sarah Sheckler, an analyst at the Duff &amp; 
Phelps securities research firm in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"The restaurant business was not . . . meeting their financial expectations," 
Sheckler said. "The restaurant segment was growing slower than their core 
(hotel) business and holding back overall company growth." 
</P>
<P>
Marriott will retain a significant stake in the catering business and will 
continue to manage food services and gift shop operations under contracts at 
airports, for example. However, Marriott completed the sale of one contract 
service -- its airline catering division -- accepting $570 million for the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, Marriott had announced plans to sell the unit, Marriott In-Flite 
Services, to Bethesda, Md.-based Caterair, a privately held company that 
includes Frederick V. Malek, a former Marriott president. But Marriott released 
no details on the sale until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The airline catering sale is expected to generate a net gain of $200 million.

BAT Begins Reshaping: London-based BAT Industries PLC, which has been the 
takeover target of a group led by Sir James Goldsmith, agreed to terms for sale 
of its 69% stake in VGI, which makes analytical instruments. The sale will be 
the first step in a shareholder-approved restructuring aimed at focusing BAT's 
businesses on tobacco and financial services, including its Los Angeles-based 
Farmers Group insurance holding company. Goldsmith supports the divestment but 
would strip BAT of financial services as well, including a sale of Farmers to 
Axa-Midi Assurances SA of France.

Sears Moves to Revamp Image: Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. is ending its 10-year 
association with model Cheryl Tiegs and loosening its ties to Walt Disney Co. 
as the giant retailer continues its search for a winning image to revitalize 
its lackluster retail business. The moves come as the Chicago-based retailer 
struggles to maintain its No. 1 sales status against challengers K mart Corp. 
and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Sears suffers from a weak fashion image, analysts say, 
because the retailer is better known to consumers as a purveyor of tools, 
appliances and automotive goods, despite a switch earlier this year to everyday 
low pricing to lure back budget-conscious shoppers of all stripes.

THE N.Y. RUPTURE OVER HARE'S 'SECRET RAPTURE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every once in awhile, my cat rouses from dyspeptic lethargy, arches her back, 
stiffens her tail and launches herself across the room at the great and 
invisible Rat of Rats that she has conjured up in her sleep. 
</P>
<P>
The Broadway theater community -- as confined, overfed, undernourished and as 
dependable a secreter of hairballs as any apartment cat -- periodically goes 
into a like frenzy with the New York Times theater critic. Watched, deferred 
to, applauded toward -- when I had the job, one producer used to seat himself 
and his guests next to me so I would be sure to notice their spontaneous 
enthusiasm for what was going on upon the stage -- the Times critic is 
transfigured every few seasons into theater's own Rat of Rats. 
</P>
<P>
As this is written, Frank Rich has been allowed to reassume his corduroy 
jacket, tuck his tail out of sight, let his nose subside from pointy to round, 
and take up once more the task of staying sober and awake in the theater four 
or five times a week, making no friends, keeping his sensibility fresh and his 
irritability manageable and trying to give a clear account of what he has seen 
and what he thinks about it. The latest frenzy -- headlines in Variety, a 
front-page story in the Wall Street Journal, long pieces in the Village Voice 
and 7 Days -- seems to have died down. 
</P>
<P>
It was splashier than most. British playwright David Hare wrote an angry letter 
to Rich after the latter had given a strongly adverse review to Hare's "The 
Secret Rapture," which opened on Broadway. Rich had seen the play in London and 
loved it. He still loved it; but now Hare had taken over as director and was 
using a different cast. Hare's staging rendered the play's virtues invisible, 
Rich wrote; the director turned out to be the playwright's "worst enemy." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Hare's letter accused Rich of closing his play -- it did 
close a few days after it opened -- by his harshness. Holding the power he did, 
Hare argued, Rich's duty, in the case of a "serious" play, was to couch 
whatever criticisms he had in a loving fashion. He implied that Rich was 
power-hungry. He had made himself emperor of the New York theater, at the cost 
of reducing this empire to ashes in which only baubles and overfinanced 
musicals could survive. 
</P>
<P>
To which Rich replied with considerable heat that his only duty was to tell the 
truth as he saw it. To mince words; to tell people to see a play because it was 
serious, to conceal that it wasn't very good, would be of no use. Theatergoers 
are not gullible and they don't go to the theater on a worthiness kick. 
</P>
<P>
There is an issue of principle here. Who or what is a critic supposed to serve: 
his/her own aesthetic conscience, the reader's, the serious theater, the 
commercial theater? That last category may seem far-fetched, but there have 
been, and still are, critics who fit in it, writing more or less along the 
lines of: Isn't Broadway Fun! Variety's treatment of the latest flap was 
nakedly commercial; Rich was assessed simply in terms of the number of "pans" 
he had delivered. Nothing was said about the quality of the plays he had 
panned. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there seems to have been a certain manipulation of the dispute by 
the theater Establishment. A lot of faxing was done; the play's Broadway press 
agent tried to get Rich to meet with Hare. Rich refused; it is hard to see what 
such a meeting would have accomplished apart from putting even more pressure on 
the critic. 
</P>
<P>
As for Hare himself, he undoubtedly has a real argument. Theater of genuine 
artistic intent lives under continual threat. Surely, when a serious play 
reaches Broadway, the critic should support it. Particularly when the critic 
admires the play. Couldn't Rich have gone easier on the performance? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps -- or at least, perhaps his language could have been a trifle less 
waspish. Critics get tired, and they get sore. And one thing that gets them 
especially sore is to see a play, which they have seen done so well, wasting a 
rare Broadway opportunity by being done much less well. 
</P>
<P>
But a critic can do only one thing: write what he/she sees, feels and thinks. 
If the critic is wrong -- and we all are, often -- at least it is an error that 
doesn't muddy the water. What does muddy the water is, one: trying to 
second-guess what your readers will or will not like; and, two: trying to 
second-guess what is in the interests of Theater Art. Nobody knows that, not 
even Hare. Meanwhile, the little light the critic has to contribute is not 
served by indulgence. You don't strike a match on butter. 
</P>
<P>
As for tone, a review lives by its phrasing. It is a minor art but an art, 
nonetheless. It is not a weather report. Critics who write a prudent 
bureaucratese may, if unfavorable, do less harm than one whose language 
flashes. But they also do less to fix and elevate what moves them and, 
hopefully, will move the world. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there is no American critic so nakedly exposed as the Times' theater 
critic. Insofar as theater is a New York affair -- and it still is, 
unfortunately, to a great extent -- it seems to be the only voice that counts. 
This is true nowhere else -- not in books, music, art or film. There is some 
power to it, though none to enjoy; the theater critic makes no money off what 
he praises, and, if he is sensible, as Rich is, he doesn't stay around to be 
praised, loved or invited to parties. 
</P>
<P>
To be the solitary voice is a burden, not a privilege. I agree with Rich that 
its duty is to speak as freely as if that burden weren't there. Yet it is 
impossible to ignore; it takes a toll even on a Rat of Rats. There are things 
that can sometimes be avoided: personal attacks, excessive vituperation. Yet 
again, often they can't be. Critics are not a passive partner to the kicking, 
high-stepping, pirouetting bit of theater that comes out at them. They must 
high-kick and pirouette right back. 
</P>
<P>
What licenses all this, of course, is that I was Frank Rich's immediate 
predecessor. I too was built up as the assassin of the theater. The difference 
was that the man who was then the New York Times editor sided with the critic's 
critics and invited me out after two years. It seemed to have caused pain both 
ways, personal and institutional. Rich has received exemplary support ever 
since, and he will undoubtedly be around as long as he can stand it.

In the 1960s, "Good night, Chet," "Good night, David" was an instantly 
recognizable TV sign-off. The pairing of Chet Huntley and David Brinkley as 
co-anchors on "The Huntley-Brinkley Report" gave NBC the predominant newscast 
for a decade -- and, according to a survey at the time, made the two 
newscasters better known than Cary Grant, James Stewart or the Beatles.

In the 1970s, it was Walter Cronkite's turn. On the "CBS Evening News," 
Cronkite was such a popular figure that he was not simply the No. 1 anchor -- 
he was "the most trusted man in America." 
</P>
<P>
The network newscasts were a nightly national seance where Americans came 
together over TV tray tables to watch the dramatic stories of the day. There 
was no Cable News Network or two-hour local newscasts. ABC, founded after the 
other two broadcast networks, was considered an upstart operation. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the three broadcast newscasts are locked in a tightly contested ratings 
race, and ABC's "World News Tonight" with Peter Jennings is on a winning 
streak. With increased news options and changing viewer habits, the day may be 
gone when a single anchor could hold sway over a worshipful era. But the recent 
change in the ratings has broadcasters wondering whether Jennings and ABC will 
be able to turn their winning streak into a long-running standard. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 weeks, "World News Tonight" has edged out "The CBS Evening 
News With Dan Rather" as the top-rated program in the Nielsen ratings, with 
"NBC Nightly News With Tom Brokaw" a close third. While the lead has 
occasionally changed hands in recent years, CBS has most often led in the 
ratings. 
</P>
<P>
In the most recent ratings, "World News Tonight" had an 11.2 rating and 21% of 
the available audience, "The CBS Evening News" had a 10.2 rating and a 19% 
share of the audience, and NBC had a 9.9 rating and 18% share. Each rating 
point represents 921,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the closeness of the competition, even the small ratings-point 
difference can mean millions of dollars in advertising revenue -- and prestige 
for all of the network's news programs. 
</P>
<P>
For Jennings, who had a brief stint as a 26-year-old network anchor in 1965 in 
an ill-conceived move by ABC to counter the competition with Jennings' youth 
and good looks, the recent surge in the ratings may indicate growing popularity 
for his urbane approach and interest in foreign news. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's my Protestant upbringing, but I think it's hypocritical for me to 
boast about ratings after saying we shouldn't be judged by ratings when we were 
No. 3," Jennings says. "Still, when you have a week such as the one where we 
were in Prague, Rome and Malta, and you think you've seen people tuning in to 
the network for a particular occasion, that pleases me for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
"Being No. 1 in news takes the right combination of anchor and broadcast," says 
one veteran news executive. "Jennings is a very good anchor who projects an 
image of knowledge and authority. At the same time, ABC has quietly put 
together a list of correspondents who offer the kind of analysis that 
distinguishes network news from local stations." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent Times-Mirror poll of public attitudes toward the media, Jennings 
was rated the most believable among the network anchors. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's move ahead comes at a time of major breaking stories, from the Bay Area 
earthquake to the avalanche of change in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
In the new era of globe-trotting anchors, Rather, Jennings and Brokaw all 
provided extensive, live coverage of recent events abroad, from the Berlin Wall 
to the summit in Malta. Canadian-born Jennings -- who worked for many years 
abroad for ABC as a foreign correspondent -- previously had emphasized foreign 
news on his newscast, and ABC researchers say viewers identify him with the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
"We do periodic studies of people who watch the evening news, and Jennings is 
seen as particularly strong in that area," says Alan Wurtzel, senior vice 
president in charge of marketing research services for ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Although ABC has a ways to go before matching the 204-week winning streak of 
the "CBS Evening News" with Dan Rather, ABC researchers see promising trends in 
the recent demographics. 
</P>
<P>
(Ironically, since NBC is able to charge advertisers more for the younger 
profile of "Nightly News" viewers, according to network sources, NBC is said to 
have less reason for concern than CBS, even though NBC "Nightly News" comes in 
third in the overall ratings. "World News Tonight," according to sources, has 
been able to charge more for its ads than NBC because of its strength in urban 
markets. By contrast, the audience for CBS -- and the "CBS Evening News" -- 
traditionally has shown strength among older viewers.) 
</P>
<P>
"In the past weeks, we've increased our audience of viewers aged 50-plus by 
5%," says Wurtzel of ABC. "Those are the core news-watchers, and they're hard 
to wrench away." 
</P>
<P>
What effect, if any, is ABC's recent move ahead having at the other two 
networks? Noting that other factors, such as the performance of local stations 
carrying the CBS newscast may be having an effect on the ratings of "The CBS 
Evening News," executive producer Tom Bettag says: "It's too early to make any 
conclusions about where this is coming from. Dan (Rather) has been the No. 1 
anchor for many years, and we feel that we've had one of our best years in 
terms of our news coverage. We've made some changes this year -- for example, 
having Dan stand to do the news -- and we're not planning any other changes at 
this moment." 
</P>
<P>
"Any time your newscast drops from No. 1, there's concern," says another CBS 
source, who notes that CBS's third-place performance in prime-time also may be 
hurting "CBS Evening News," while ABC is showing improvement against 
first-place NBC in prime time. "No edicts have been issued to producers, but 
there are meetings going on to review all of the elements of the newscast." 
</P>
<P>
CBS has built its newscast around Rather, says one news executive. "Yet in many 
ways he is the least comfortable among the anchors with the 'performance' part 
of the job." 
</P>
<P>
Rather's intense demeanor may work against him in the "cool" medium of TV, 
which contradictingly requires that the anchor be a good reporter and also a 
calm figure giving viewers the news. Incidents such as Rather's 1988 interview 
with presidential candidate George Bush may cost him some popularity among 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, network news divisions have experienced staff cutbacks, and 
"World News Tonight" may have benefited from the fact that ABC News has been 
able to create several successful new series, from "Nightline" to "This Week 
With David Brinkley." David Poltrack, senior vice president in charge of 
planning and research for CBS, theorizes that the ratings surge began with 
ABC's coverage of the Oct. 17 Bay Area earthquake, when ABC, with its baseball 
announcers broadcasting the World Series live from Candlestick Park, got the 
jump on the coverage and continued with Ted Koppel for many hours throughout 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they've benefited from the combination of 'Nightline' and 'World News 
Tonight,' " he said, "and the blip we're seeing now can be traced to the 
earthquake, where ABC initially seemed to own that story. Some NBC or CBS 
viewers who were watching the World Series and suddenly saw the earthquake 
coverage ended up sampling ABC News, and a few of them may have become regular 
viewers." 
</P>
<P>
"NBC Nightly News" in recent months experimented with its mix of stories, 
re-editing broadcasts to elongate some stories and shorten others, experiments 
that executive producer Bill Wheatley characterized as "fine-tuning," not 
planned major changes. 
</P>
<P>
"Nightly News" was criticized earlier this year for its lateness in getting on 
the air with coverage of the San Francisco earthquake. (NBC News officials 
originally attributed the difficulties to problems with equipment at its local 
affiliates, but later NBC accepted some of the blame.) But morale improved when 
Brokaw later was the first to broadcast live from Berlin as the Wall was coming 
down. 
</P>
<P>
NBC also has lost some "name" correspondents to the other networks, and the 
news division has not created a successful prime-time magazine news show, 
although hopes are high for the upcoming prime-time magazine show being created 
for Jane Pauley. 
</P>
<P>
Josephine Holtz, the director of news-audience research for NBC, also maintains 
that ABC has benefited from having the Oprah Winfrey talk show as a lead-in to 
the local news on many stations affiliated with ABC. According to a study done 
by NBC, she says, stations that have Oprah Winfrey as the lead-in to their 
local news have a greater chance of having the top-rated local news, which then 
benefits the network newscast. The program that precedes the evening newscast, 
Holtz contends, is more important than what follows it. 
</P>
<P>
"Our research indicates that Tom Brokaw is popular and respected by viewers," 
said Holtz. "We feel confident about the program." 
</P>
<P>
All of this talk of personal popularity and dissecting ratings makes many 
newscasters uncomfortable, and they say that they don't use audience polls to 
determine the news. 
</P>
<P>
"I never read the research," says Paul Friedman, executive producer of "World 
News Tonight." "That's not my job." 
</P>
<P>
Friedman says that he has been encouraged by viewers' letters and phone calls 
in response to "American Agenda," longer segments on issues such as child-care 
and the environment. All three evening newscasts have longer-format sections, 
which seek to give more depth to issues and are seen as a way to differentiate 
the evening-news programs from local news. 
</P>
<P>
But, Friedman said, those segments came not out of research but journalistic 
instinct, the oldest research tool in the book. 
</P>
<P>
"The ratings differences among us are minor," says "NBC Nightly News" senior 
producer Cheryl Gould. "All of this attention to the news ratings trivializes 
the seriousness of what we're trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the news Nielsens land on TV news executives' desks every week. And for 
better or worse, they are one yardstick of success in the larger world of 
broadcasting.

NASH PHOTO GIFT TO L.A. COUNTY MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pop singer Graham Nash has decided to auction his widely acclaimed collection 
of photography, but he won't take all the money and run. A generous portion of 
the proceeds will go to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for the 
acquisition of non-traditional photographs. 
</P>
<P>
A sale of more than 450 works from Nash's collection, scheduled for April 25 at 
Sotheby's New York, is expected to bring more than $2 million. Nash intends to 
recoup his investment -- an amount that has yet to be determined by his 
accountants. Once he has recovered his costs, he will split his profit with the 
museum. In addition, Nash will donate about 140 of the most up-to-date 
photographs to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Why is he selling? 
</P>
<P>
"I love the thrill of the chase and the energy of new fields. In the '60s that 
energy was in rock 'n' roll. In the '70s, it was in collecting photography," 
said Nash, who rocked to fame in the '60s with Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash. 
</P>
<P>
During the '80s, Nash said, his interests turned from photography's historical 
spectrum to contemporary works done with experimental techniques including 
computers. He has collected up-to-the-minute photographs, but now he will turn 
that job over to an institution that can handle the job professionally. 
</P>
<P>
Nash's gift of about 140 works from the '80s will give a considerable boost to 
the museum's small collection. The auction proceeds should put the museum on 
the map as a collector of contemporary photography. While photography prices 
have risen dramatically along with the rest of the art market, photographs are 
still relatively affordable. Nash's money gift -- which could total several 
hundred thousand dollars -- will be significant. 
</P>
<P>
The musician could have gifted an institution that has a bigger and better 
photography collection, but he opted to aid a local museum that has only begun 
to establish its commitment to photography. "The County Museum of Art has been 
criticized for not doing enough for photography. Instead of criticizing, I'd 
rather help," Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted and very grateful, particularly at a time when gifts to 
museums are very hard to develop. Graham Nash's generosity will go a long, long 
way to help us build a mature department of photography," said Earl A. Powell, 
director of LACMA. The museum's photography collection currently covers a broad 
of history but is strongest in post-1945 work, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
The Nash auction will be "the most important single-owner sale of photographs 
ever to come to auction," according to Beth Gates-Warren, director of Sotheby's 
department of photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Nash's collection is unusually broad, reaching from "Feathers," an 1845 
cyanotype by British photographer Anna Atkins (valued between $5,000 and 
$8,000) to Duane Michals' 1973 triple portrait of Andy Warhol ($2,000 to 
$2,500). Nineteenth-Century images include works by Julia Margaret Cameron and 
Peter Henry Emerson. Twentieth-Century pieces encompass the visions of Lewis 
Hine, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Edward Steichen and Harry Callahan. 
</P>
<P>
"Graham Nash began collecting so early -- in the early '70s during the 
formative years of the market -- that he was able to acquire pieces that you 
don't usually see at auction. He traveled a great deal, he was in touch with 
book and photography dealers and he had a lot of people looking for him," 
Gates-Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
Prime among the pieces in the upcoming sale are works by Paul Outerbridge, 
whose abstract still lifes, female nudes and surreal images are widely admired 
by photography collectors and critics. A 1927 self-portrait of the artist in a 
mask and top hat -- a striking image that has never appeared at auction -- is 
expected to bring at least $60,000. Two other Outerbridge works, "Saltine Box, 
Version II" and "H.O. Box" (which comes with a drawing of the same subject), 
are each estimated at $50,000 to $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
A self-portrait by Steichen is valued at $30,000 to $50,000; his portrait of 
Gloria Swanson is expected to bring $10,000 to $20,000. The image that 
persuaded Nash to start collecting photographs, Diane Arbus' "Child With Toy 
Hand Grenade in Central Park," also will go on the block, at an estimated price 
of $12,000 to $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
Nash said that Arbus' image of a scrawny, grimacing kid holding a war toy as if 
it would explode any minute is a great example of photography's "power to move" 
human emotions. That famous picture turned him into an acquisitor, but he was 
already primed for action by his father who was an amateur photographer and by 
his own earlier interest in 19th-Century photographs of North American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Gates-Warren characterized the Nash collection as focusing on "human nature" 
and reflecting Nash's ironic sense of humor. "He is a photographer himself. He 
has a very good eye and sense of composition, but he also feels a lot of 
empathy with the subjects of his photographs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Nash's collection was shown at UCLA in 1981 as part of a traveling exhibition.

STILL DRY: As most of the nation shivers (A35), the problem here is rain -- or 
the lack of same. . . . WeatherData, a private weather service, says no 
immediate end is in sight for Southern California's prolonged drought. "Right 
now, we're starting to get nervous," says meteorologist Rick Dittmann. "This 
high pressure has been here, it's been persistent for two months now, and 
although we have some of the rainier months ahead, we do need to start getting 
some precipitation.". . . The Santa Ana reporting station (B9) shows 1.04 
inches of precipitation for the season; normal for this date is 3.01 inches.

RECOGNITION: Local residents have long lamented that neither the Rams nor 
Angels are associated nationally with Orange County. . . . But with both 
Anaheim and Santa Ana planning sports arenas and trying to lure a professional 
basketball or hockey franchise in the 1990s (C1), Orange County could finally 
hit the sports map. . . . "The real benefit comes out when events are televised 
nationally, which makes people aware of the area," says a local consultant. . .

built an arena there?" Dana Parsons and Mark I. Pinsky

ANCHORS AWEIGH: One problem for Jennings, Brokaw and Rather (F1) is that there 
are more cable and local options for viewers. . . . In Orange County, that 
means you can watch Merker and Matthews. . . . That would be Michelle Merker 
and Pat Matthews, anchors of the county's only regular newscast. For the first 
time, the KDOC-Channel 56 news show has showed up on the Arbitron ratings 
service, watched in at least 5,000 non-cable households. . . . Starting Dec. 
27, the half-hour nightly broadcast moves from its 8:30 slot to 8. Dana Parsons

HANDICAPPED FUNDING CRISIS CLAIMED; 
</P>
<P>
WELFARE: A TUSTIN-BASED WATCHDOG GROUP THREATENS TO SUE, CHARGING THAT STATE 
OFFICIALS HAVE VIOLATED THE RIGHTS OF THE DISABLED WHO NEED BETTER HOUSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
TUSTIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County advocates for the handicapped threatened to sue state officials 
Monday, declaring that tight-fisted funding over the past four years has 
violated "the human, civil, legal and service rights" of handicapped people in 
need of better housing. 
</P>
<P>
The handicapped children and adults affected include those unable to walk, some 
who are blind and deaf, and some who have brain disorders. 
</P>
<P>
In an unusual move, the Tustin-based watchdog agency, known as the Area XI 
Developmental Disabilities Board, formally charged in a Dec. 13 letter to the 
state Department of Developmental Services that the agency is "out of 
compliance" with state laws protecting such handicapped people. Calling the 
situation a "crisis," the board cited the cases of about 200 handicapped people 
in Orange County who have "inappropriate" housing. 
</P>
<P>
If more state money is not made available, the board may pursue legal action 
against the state, warned Rhys Burchill, executive director of the watchdog 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
A state official, however, denied Monday that there has been inadequate funding 
for the handicapped in Orange County or any other part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see it as a crisis," said Greg Sandin, assistant to the director of 
developmental services. Sandin added: "The (Deukmejian) administration has 
adequately funded the programs (for the handicapped) and will continue to do 
so." 
</P>
<P>
At issue are community-based homes, such as board-and-care facilities, that can 
house small numbers of handicapped people who don't need to be hospitalized or 
committed to institutions. Burchill said such small homes, located near the 
families of the handicapped, can offer residents individual care. 
</P>
<P>
But because of the high cost of housing in Orange County and other parts of the 
state, many of these care homes are going out of business, Burchill said. The 
displaced handicapped then have to be moved into already crowded, large state 
institutions. In some cases, the handicapped must return to relatives who are 
hard-pressed to properly care for them, Burchill added. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, this situation is not limited to only Orange County," Burchill 
said. "It is occurring all over the state." She said that the state has not 
been keeping up with the cost of living in providing funds for housing the 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is particularly severe in expensive areas such as Orange County, 
she said. "The state doesn't have a differential for costs according to area," 
Burchill said. 
</P>
<P>
'Out of Compliance' 
</P>
<P>
In the Dec. 13 letter to Gary Macomber, developmental services director, the 
watchdog group formally charged the state agency -- which funnels aid to the 
handicapped -- with being "out of compliance" with state law. The charge 
triggers an internal administrative review, Burchill said. 
</P>
<P>
"After receiving the letter, the (state) department has 30 days to respond and 
to modify their policies and practices," Burchill said. "If they don't, the 
board can hold a public hearing where people testify about our allegations (of 
insufficient housing aid to the handicapped). At that point, the board could 
then request money from the state Council on Developmental Disabilities for 
litigation and take the matter to court." 
</P>
<P>
The little-known developmental disability area boards are citizen-watchdog 
groups that, under state law, have the power to look over state and federal 
programs for the handicapped. The Orange County board made headlines in the 
fall of 1988 when it accused county education Supt. Robert Peterson and the 
county Department of Education of violating handicapped children's civil rights 
by not providing adequate school busing for them. The county department 
ultimately remedied the shortage. 
</P>
<P>
Burchill said the current battle by the Area XI board is simply to enforce 
state law that mandates that adequate housing be provided to disabled and 
handicapped people. 
</P>
<P>
"At the present time individuals with developmental disabilities find 
themselves pawns of a rapidly growing trend back toward institutionalization 
and are often faced with no option other than inappropriate placement at state 
development centers," board chairman Ronald Mincer wrote in the Dec. 13 letter. 
</P>
<P>
Local board members, he continued, "believe that violation of the human, civil, 
legal and service rights of persons with developmental disabilities must not be 
tolerated any longer. . . . This letter serves to officially notify the 
Department of Developmental Services that Area Board XI is initiating 
noncompliance proceedings against the department. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Sandin, of the state department's Sacramento office, said he could not comment 
specifically on the local board's letter on Monday "because we have not yet 
received it." But Sandin denied the board's overall allegation that Gov. George 
Deukmejian's administration has provided insufficient funding for the 
handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
Burchill, however, said the watchdog agency for the handicapped "has been very 
concerned (about state aid to the handicapped) for the last four years. . . . 
'Crisis' is the right word to describe the situation."

BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB CHANGES LOCATION

<P>
The Brea Boys and Girls Club Monday dedicated a new clubhouse, a temporary 
building on a city-owned lot, which will be the club's home while a permanent 
and larger clubhouse is being planned and built. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1985, the club has been housed at Laurel Elementary School. Because 
of building rehabilitation at the school, the club has been forced to move. The 
new location is 502 S. Sievers Ave., next to the Brea Senior Citizens Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Soroptimist Club of Brea will pay the lease on the temporary building, 
owned by Founders National Bank, for four years. The bank has agreed to sell 
the building to the Boys and Girls Club for $1 at the end of that time, said 
executive director Dick Guthrie. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,000 boys and girls belong to the La Habra-Brea Boys and Girls 
Clubs, which has clubhouses at four sites. The overall budget for the clubs is 
$400,000. Most of the funding comes from local sources, with 21% from the 
United Way, Guthrie said. 
</P>
<P>
Activities at the new site will include games, arts and crafts, sports, and a 
variety of group activities. An after-school, day-care program operates from 
2:15 to 8 p.m., Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions are under way with the Brea School District on the possibility of 
constructing a permanent facility for the Brea Boys and Girls Club at Brea 
Junior High. This could involve building a gymnasium and other facilities, 
which would be shared by the district and the club, Guthrie said. DAVID F.

COUNCIL TO WEIGH NIGHTCLUB PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Live entertainment at the Purple Heart Saloon may come to an end when the City 
Council tonight considers whether to grant an extension of the nightclub's 
entertainment permit. 
</P>
<P>
Because of "noise complaints and disturbances . . . far outweighing those of 
other establishments where alcoholic beverages are served," the city staff has 
recommended against extending the permit. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of Purple Heart Saloon, Kenneth L. Hermon, has requested a permit for 
disc jockeys and live bands to perform on Friday and Saturday nights from 8 
p.m. to 1 a.m. The permit would also allow performances for special events, 
including a New Years' Eve party, a post-Super Bowl party and wedding 
receptions. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who live near the saloon at 534 S. Brea Blvd. have complained that 
patrons leave broken bottles and other litter in the area, and sometimes 
urinate near homes. 
</P>
<P>
Dan and Linda Kelly, who have led the neighborhood protest against the night 
club, have complained to the City Council about loud music playing at 1:30 a.m. 
and fighting in the alley between the saloon and their home.

YEAR-ROUND SCHOOL STUDY IS ACCEPTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A study showing three options for year-round schools in Capistrano Unified 
School District was accepted Monday by the board of trustees, although no 
preferred plan was chosen. 
</P>
<P>
By submitting the study to state officials before Jan. 1, the district 
qualifies for extra money for school construction from next year's year-round 
program budget, according to a report by Assistant Supt. William D. Eller. 
</P>
<P>
His study used projected enrollment figures and classroom capacities to show 
three ways that year-round schools could be set up. 
</P>
<P>
One version divides students into four groups who would attend school for nine 
weeks, then take three weeks off, rotating vacations so that one group is 
always off. 
</P>
<P>
A second option uses the same four groups, but the rotation changes every 12 
weeks and students get a four-week vacation. 
</P>
<P>
The third schedule is heralded in Eller's report as "the best space-saver of 
current year-round calendars." Using three groups, students are required to 
attend four out of six terms and take the remaining two terms as a vacation. 
Each term is 43 days. 
</P>
<P>
After the first group of students completes two terms, the second group starts 
its session. The process is repeated for the third group, which starts after 
the second group has completed two terms. By this time, the first group is on 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Eller's report said the last option is the cheapest because it would require 
fewer portable classrooms. WENDY PAULSON

HUBBUB AT POSTAL HUB AS SIEGE HITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The county's General Post Office in Santa Ana found itself under siege Monday, 
grappling with double the normal number of cards and letters and packages in 
the holiday mail crush. 
</P>
<P>
On a normal day, about 1.5 million pieces of mail come through the facility -- 
officially the Santa Ana Sectional Center -- but Monday 3 million cards, 
letters and packages were processed. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,400 employees dug in for the barrage of holiday mail like seasoned 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"You know it's coming," said Gladys Quan, 50, a postal worker for 21 years. 
"It's not like it creeps up on you." 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every piece of mail posted in the county is processed at the facility, a 
bustling, noisy postal hub for all but six Orange County cities. On any normal 
day, the center's operations are a lesson in controlled chaos. At Christmas, 
it's just plain chaos. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, the machines worked nonstop, sorting an endless stream of multicolored 
envelopes that cascaded down sorting "waterfalls" to waiting mail handlers. 
</P>
<P>
And it wasn't just the machines that worked nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
"We work 12 hours a day, six days a week, and you got your home to take care of 
and you got your presents to buy," Quan said. "I hit the malls right after 
Thanksgiving." 
</P>
<P>
Roberta Kriksciun, 31, of Vista, has also worked long hours, including 12-hour 
shifts, seven days a week, in the three weeks immediately after Thanksgiving. 
But she, unlike other postal workers, didn't lose any time away from her 
husband, Mark. 
</P>
<P>
"He works here, too," said Kriksciun, a letter sorting machine operator and a 
Postal Service employee for more than eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Kriksciun's job is to key-punch in the first three numbers of the ZIP code for 
every letter that passes before her -- one per second. That's about 500 letters 
an hour, amounting to more than 6,000 on a 12-hour shift. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done this for so long it gives me time to think," she said. "It makes me 
think why we're here six or seven days a week, 12 hours a day. I get a chance 
to think of what the meaning of Christmas is. It gives me a real good 
perspective." 
</P>
<P>
While the increased hours are designed to keep up with the surge of mail, the 
long shifts can actually decrease efficiency, according to Bill Fisher, a 
superintendent on the afternoon shift. 
</P>
<P>
"The workload is heavier," Fisher said. "The employees get a little tired by 
the end of the night, so our productivity isn't what is should be." 
</P>
<P>
Hector Godinez, the Postal Service's field service director for Orange County, 
said productivity can also be affected by factors that even advanced technology 
can't handle. 
</P>
<P>
"Our bar code readers (devices that electronically cancel stamps) cannot pick 
up a colored envelope," he said. "So we're using our old-time canceling 
machines that we have to feed by hand." 
</P>
<P>
Another problem, Godinez said, is that optical character readers -- electronic 
machines that "read" addresses and ZIP codes -- can't read script, which most 
people use to address Christmas cards. 
</P>
<P>
And despite its "neither rain nor sleet" motto, the Postal Service is still at 
the mercy of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
"If the planes don't land (because of bad weather), the mail doesn't land 
either," said Postal Service spokesman Joseph Breckenridge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HANDLING THE DELUGE 
</P>
<P>
Monday was the busiest day of the year for the Santa Ana Sectional Center of 
the Post Office, the postal "hub" where mail for all but six Orange County 
cities is gathered and processed. 
</P>
<P>
Other busy periods, according to spokesman Joseph Breckenridge, are: 
</P>
<P>
April 15 -- deadline for income tax returns 
</P>
<P>
Mother's Day 
</P>
<P>
Week before the opening of school -- Breckenridge says many stores clog the 
mails by sending out circulars advertising back-to-school sales. 
</P>
<P>
Week after Christmas -- retailers clog the mails with post-Christmas sales 
circulars. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; 
</P>
<P>
GROUP HAS NEW PLAN TO UNITE COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A residents group that formed out of frustration with the City Council has new 
plans for bringing harmony to the tumultuous council. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin Residents Action Committee leaders say they are tired of council 
meetings where heated debates, angry exchanges and bitter accusations are 
commonplace. The resulting negative publicity may discourage business 
investment in the city and affect property values, the leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of residents in Tustin who don't want to be the laughingstock 
of Southern California and, quite frankly, we are," said one of TRAC's leaders, 
Guido Borges, manager of a family owned travel company in Tustin and president 
of Laurelwood Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The group has printed a brochure calling for "a council composition that 
promotes a professional atmosphere in the council chambers." A monthly 
newsletter also is planned. 
</P>
<P>
The group first formed as Citizens for a Responsible Tustin City Council after 
the Sept. 18 council meeting, at which Councilman Earl J. Prescott turned his 
back on the audience for 20 minutes. Prescott later explained he was in pain. 
</P>
<P>
After that meeting, group members called for the resignation of Prescott and 
John Kelly and contemplated a recall campaign. But now the group has changed 
its name and strategy, said chairman Carl Kasalek. 
</P>
<P>
The group plans to hold a candidates' forum and support three candidates in the 
April election, Kasalek said. Several of the group's leaders are presidents of 
local homeowners associations with historically high voter turnout. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly is not impressed by the group's plans. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like that bogus group they had before," Kelly said. "I don't want to 
comment on it until they do something of substance." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that is because the group believes that one way to turn things around 
is to remove Kelly from office in the coming election. His seat will be open, 
along with that of Mayor Pro Tem Ursula E. Kennedy and the unexpired term of 
Councilman Ronald B. Hoesterey, who resigned last month. 
</P>
<P>
Hoesterey's resignation leaves the council open to deadlocks, with Mayor 
Richard B. Edgar and Kennedy on one side, and Kelly and Prescott on the other. 
For instance, the council recently deadlocked on whether to make developers pay 
for street improvements in areas along the border between Santa Ana and Tustin. 
Before Hoesterey's resignation, the two cities had given preliminary approval 
to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Prescott and Kelly disagree with that decision and with developer fees in 
principle, calling them a form of taxation. TRAC members, along with Edgar and 
Kennedy, support charging developers for the road improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the residents group also say Kelly and Prescott are hurting the city 
financially, even turning businesses away. For example, controversy stemming 
from Kelly's and Prescott's objections led to the demise in October of a 
proposal to build a 105-room hotel just south of the Santa Ana Freeway at 
Newport Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
More than issues, though, TRAC leaders object to the style of Kelly and 
Prescott, which they say is argumentative and unprofessional. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people who are so upset and so furious," Borges said. 
"We've tried to take this emotion and turn it into something positive." SHANNON

NEW AMNESTY RULE BENEFITS IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County Coalition for Immigrant Rights told immigrants at a special 
community meeting Monday that they might be eligible for amnesty even if they 
were previously rejected because they had received welfare. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrants who did not apply for amnesty by the original 1988 deadline because 
they had received public assistance now have until Dec. 29 to file for amnesty 
under a ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Garcia earlier this month. The 
ruling also requires that the Immigration and Naturalization Service inform 
previously rejected applicants about the new class of amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
But many immigrants who fall into the extension status may not be aware of the 
ruling and might miss the new deadline, said Robin Blackwell, coordinator of 
the Orange County coalition. The number of immigrants who fall into this status 
is undetermined, Blackwell said. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition has scheduled another community meeting Wednesday at 6 p.m. at 
the George Washington Community Center, 250 E. Cypress St., Anaheim, near City 
Hall.

DON'T EXPECT BASEBALL SALARIES TO HIT THE ROOF IN THE 1990S, AGENT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Projecting astronomical salaries for major league baseball players in the 1990s 
based on this year's advent of the sport's first $3 million men will result in 
overinflated guesses, according to a player agent. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Reich, whose clients include Lance Parrish and Brian Downing of the Angels, 
said it's unrealistic to expect that salaries will continue to increase at the 
pace they skyrocketed between 1988 and '89, because the end of collusion made 
this year unique. Salaries and revenues will be higher in the '90s, Reich 
predicted, but the escalation won't proceed at a breathtaking pace. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should project (1990s salaries) based on a percentage or proportion of 
the increase from last year to this (year), because this is a four-year 
catch-up from a price fix," said Reich, who declined to speculate on exact 
salaries or averages in the coming decade. "Like after a wage or price freeze, 
legal or illegal, there's a catch-up period and that's what we're having now. 
That doesn't mean we won't get some increases, but we're not going to get the 
same kind (of escalation) like last year to this . . . 
</P>
<P>
"A bankable star, whether in music, movies, TV or sports, is going to get his 
price and always will. The salaries of megastars will go up, but franchises 
will have higher value, too. What I do think we'll see is a revenue deal, 
revenue sharing between the players and owners cutting up that big, fat, 
opulent pie. TV revenues are going to go up; the potential of pay-per-view is 
staggering. Could you imagine what they could get if pay-per-view sold the 
World Series around the world? 
</P>
<P>
"There's always been a relationship between revenues and salary since free 
agency. Before, the owners kept all the money. Now, the players get their cut. 
There's a direct correlation between revenues and salary." 
</P>
<P>
However large the increase in salaries, baseball's upper-echelon players are 
sure to benefit far more than the game's lesser lights. 
</P>
<P>
"The journeyman infielder will always be vulnerable," Reich said.

Nevada Las Vegas, which hopes to name its new football coach by the end of the 
week, had its field of candidates drop from seven to six Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Artie Gigantino, special teams coach for the Rams, was interviewed Monday by 
the 17-member committee. Jim Strong, offensive coordinator at Notre Dame, is

Portland State Coach Pokey Allen withdrew his name because he believed there 
weren't enough players on scholarship to rebuild the team quickly enough, 
Athletic Director Brad Rothermel said. The other three candidates are John 
Jenkins, offensive coordinator at the University of Houston, Fresno State 
recruiting coordinator Pat Hill and Gary Darnell, interim head coach at 
Florida.

TITANS' STREAK GRINDS TO A HALT

<P>
This was not Boyd Grant basketball as you remember it. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd Grant basketball in his days at Fresno State was deliberate basketball. It 
was a matchup zone defense and an almost tediously patient offense. It was a 
score in the 50s and -- often enough -- a Fresno State victory. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton took its undefeated team into Colorado State's Moby Arena 
Monday and ran into a different breed of Grant team. 
</P>
<P>
This team didn't live by the matchup zone. It was a team that wanted to run and 
did in an 84-55 victory that spoiled Fullerton's bid for its best start since 
the Titans became a Division I team. 
</P>
<P>
The loss also was an unsettling start to a stretch in which the Titans will 
play six road games in a row, and nine of 11 away from home. It also spoiled 
Fullerton's hopes of going into Saturday's game against UCLA undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
Instead they left here disconsolate. Fullerton hadn't lost so badly since the 
1987 season, when Nevada Las Vegas beat the Titans by 34 points. 
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't anything going right for us," point guard Wayne Williams said. 
"It really just brought us down to earth. We were 5-0 and thought we couldn't 
be beat. We're pretty determined not to ever lose like that again." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody had played Fullerton closer than 11 points this season. But the end of 
the Titans' early-season win streak came quickly. Colorado State led, 10-0, 
before the game was three minutes old. 
</P>
<P>
"They just ran a clinic on us on both ends of the court," Fullerton Coach John 
Sneed said. "We got outplayed in every aspect of the game. I give credit to 
Colorado State. They played fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Mitchell, who played at Mater Dei High School and Fresno State before 
coming to Colorado State to play his final season under Grant, didn't miss a 
shot in the first half. He made seven of seven from the field, including a 
three-pointer, and made his only free throw. 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Hines, a quick, smooth-moving guard, didn't miss a shot either, making 
all four he took. Mark Meredith, another guard, hit five of seven 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
And at halftime, Colorado State held a 44-30 lead. The Rams had hit 68% of 
their shots, including 70% from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State (6-2) was coming off a loss to Montana in which it scored only 
47 points. The Rams scored almost that many in the first half against 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Grant, who had watched his team shoot in 36% against Montana, was 
flabbergasted. 
</P>
<P>
"I really can't even explain it. I really can't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's Cedric Ceballos, who had been averaging 26 points a game, was held 
to 14, his lowest total of the season. Guard Mark Hill led Fullerton with 14, 
but had only two in the second half. Dareck Crane added eight for the Titans 
(5-1). 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell finished with 23 for Colorado State, and Meredith added 20. 
</P>
<P>
Who would have thought that the Rams would run like they did on Fullerton, a 
team that wants to run itself? 
</P>
<P>
Who would have thought that the Rams could start three guards and still 
outrebound the Titans, squelching Fullerton's attempts to run? 
</P>
<P>
Who would have thought that neither Hill nor Ceballos would break 20 points 
when they were averaging 48 points between them? 
</P>
<P>
And who would have thought that one team would score in the 50s and the other 
in the 80s, and that Fullerton wasn't the winner? 
</P>
<P>
"If we're not in the 60s or 70s against them, it's not a good night," Sneed 
said. "If anyone holds us in the 50s, I don't think we have a very good chance 
of playing with them." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans hadn't played any games this season that weren't runaways, and after 
Monday night, they still haven't. The starters were on the bench at the end of 
this one, too, but for a different reason. 
</P>
<P>
It was over. Way over. 
</P>
<P>
"Not one of our guys played up to their potential tonight," Sneed said. "That's 
the first time this year we've had to play behind. It's hard to play catch-up 
on the road, and harder to play catch-up against a team that's not making many 
mistakes. That makes for a long night." 
</P>
<P>
Which it was. Colorado State beat Fullerton inside and outside, with sharp 
passing and good ball movement. One minute, Mitchell was scoring on an easy 
layin inside. The next, the Rams kicked the ball back out for a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
And they did a number on the Titans' offense too. Fullerton was shooting 49% 
before the game, but shot just 38% Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Hill scored 12 points in the first half, keeping the Titans remotely close with 
four three-pointers. But in the second half, the Rams put the squeeze on him 
with a box-and-one, and Fullerton never found any one to pick up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
It was that sort of night. A three-on-two Titan fast break didn't end with a 
Ceballos dunk, but a steal by Hines, who passed it downcourt for a dunk by Eric 
Friehauf that gave Colorado State a 68-43 lead. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sort of night when Fullerton could go as cold as the frigid 
temperatures outside, failing to score for more than five minutes at one point 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sort of night Fullerton would just as soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Agee Ward, who missed a game against Cal State Northridge Saturday with strep 
throat, started against Colorado State but was only somewhat effective. He 
played 17 minutes and scored four points. . .Cal State Fullerton is 0 for 2 in 
Fort Collins this year. The football team lost to the Rams, 42-14, last season.

BARGAINS DRAW SEASON'S SHOPPERS TO SWAPS

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With their overflowing shopping cart parked next to them, Beverly Tanner and 
her daughter took a break from a heavy day of Christmas shopping at the Orange 
County Marketplace. The Tanners had launched their shopping assault at 6 a.m. 
and by lunchtime had bought gifts for the whole family. 
</P>
<P>
"I saved at least $40 on T-shirts and I finished my Christmas shopping today," 
Tanner said while resting at a picnic table. "Now we are looking for stocking 
stuffers." 
</P>
<P>
The Tanner family was among 50,000 to 60,000 shoppers who flocked to the 
Marketplace at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa on Sunday, 
preferring the outdoor swap meet to the indoor malls. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner said she made the 25-mile trip from Whittier to Costa Mesa because of 
the selection of merchandise. "I like the variety of homemade crafts, T-shirts, 
jackets, toys and tennis shoes," she said. "I was buying four T-shirts for 
$10." 
</P>
<P>
There are at least three local indoor swap meets and four outdoor swap meets to 
choose from in Orange County. Many shoppers on Sunday said they prefer swap 
meets to malls because they like the more freewheeling atmosphere and the 
one-on-one contact with the store owners. But most of all, they like the 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
"I came (to the Marketplace) because I wanted to save money," Jill Perkinson 
said. "I probably saved a few hundred dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Among the gifts Perkinson bought were lace tablecloths, tennis shoes and 
perfumes. Sitting at the snack bar having lunch, Perkinson was not only 
overwhelmed with bags but also had packages on hold at various stores. She said 
she would have to make several trips to her car. 
</P>
<P>
Although many customers and merchants extol the bargain prices, there are 
better reasons to shop at the swap meet, said Bob Teller, president of Tel Phil 
Enterprises, which runs the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers can find great deals anywhere if they really shop for them, he said. 
The main difference between the malls and the swap meets is the relaxed 
atmosphere, the freedom of space and the friendliness of the people, he added. 
Instead of simply shopping for bargains, Teller said, people should go to swap 
meets for the fun of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Come here and just stroll around," he said. "It's a great place to people 
watch." 
</P>
<P>
The swap meets, which are clustered in the central and northern areas of the 
county, range in size from 100 vendors at the smaller indoor meets to 1,200 
stalls at the Marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
A newcomer to the market is the Orange County Indoor Swap Meet in Santa Ana, 
which opened two months ago and has about 540 vendors. 
</P>
<P>
The indoor swap meet draws shoppers who don't want to brave the sun or risk 
rain. And it appeals to those who don't want to walk miles for a gift. The 
newly remodeled building is small enough that a shopper can stroll down every 
aisle, yet large enough to offer items ranging from clothes, food and plants to 
jewelry, posters and pets. 
</P>
<P>
Holly Earles, owner of 20th Century, a hair accessory store, said her business 
goes up 25% to 30% during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving the indoor swap meet carrying stuffed bags of Christmas gifts were Al 
and Rachel Cervantes. This was their third and last visit to the swap meet 
before Christmas, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"We shopped here because it's more convenient. It's not so crowded and we saved 
maybe $50," Rachel Cervantes said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple said that until this experience they had always shopped in the 
malls, but now there was no turning back. 
</P>
<P>
"We're coming back next year," Rachel Cervantes said.

QUESTION RAISED ABOUT PHOENIX DEAL TO SELL COMPUTERS TO SOVIET UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by David Olmos / Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Does Phoenix Group International have a firm deal to sell six million personal 
computers to the Soviet Union or not? 
</P>
<P>
That question was raised last week after an official of a Phoenix subsidiary 
disclosed in a signed declaration filed as part of a lawsuit that the company 
does not have a contract to sell six million PCs to the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
But an official of Irvine-based Phoenix said Monday that the Soviet deal is 
going ahead as planned. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 11, Soviet officials and Phoenix announced the formation of a joint 
venture to provide up to six million PCs to Soviet schools and other buyers. 
According to a sworn statement dated Dec. 5 by John French, president of 
Phoenix subsidiary American PC Corp. in Irvine, neither company has "ever 
received a contractual commitment pursuant to which they are entitled to sell 
six million personal computers -- or any number of personal computers of that 
magnitude -- to the Soviet Union or elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
French's statement was made in connection with a lawsuit filed in November 
against Phoenix by Michael Kolsy, American PC's chairman. Kolsy alleges in the 
suit filed in Orange County Superior Court that Phoenix illegally tried to 
dilute his one-third ownership interest in American PC in a debt-for-stock 
conversion. A Phoenix official last week called the suit "frivolous and without 
merit." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Rossiter, Phoenix's executive vice president for legal affairs, said that 
French's statement, though technically accurate, "does not necessarily reflect 
the variety of relationships being developed with the Soviets." 
</P>
<P>
Rossiter said Phoenix has shipped only several dozen PCs to the Soviets. That 
is far fewer than the 12,000 computers Phoenix originally said it planned to 
ship to the Soviets by the end of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
He said Phoenix "still feels comfortable" with the estimate that the joint 
venture will eventually provide six million PCs to the Soviet Union.

FARWEST MAKES ACTING CHIEF PERMANENT

<P>
Charles H. Green, who has been the acting president at FarWest Savings &amp; 
Loan since February, took over the duties of president and chief operating 
officer on a permanent basis Monday, the S&amp;L said. 
</P>
<P>
Green also will retain his position as chief financial officer of the thrift's 
holding company parent, FarWest Financial Corp. in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Green, a longtime commercial banker, has been with FarWest since 1984. He is 
overseeing a restructuring of the S&amp;L, which includes employee layoffs and 
a reduction in assets from $4.8 billion to as low as $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Many thrifts are undergoing similar changes to comply with more stringent 
federal requirements that were part of the industry bailout law enacted in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
The law created three tests for capital -- an institution's final reserve 
against losses -- and forced S&amp;Ls to sell their portfolios of high-risk 
corporate securities known as junk bonds. FarWest doesn't meet two of the three 
capital requirements and took a $22.9-million loss for the third quarter 
because it had to write down the value of its junk bond holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Green was given control of FarWest in late February when the S&amp;L's 
president at the time, Victor H. Indiek, and a top aide were fired for making 
unauthorized investments with depositor funds. 
</P>
<P>
The aide, Ronald D. Struck, then FarWest's chief financial officer, had 
previously been warned about his failure to follow the S&amp;L's policies on 
investments, FarWest executives said at the time. And Indiek, who had 
handpicked Struck for the post, knew about previous improper investments by 
Struck and was held accountable. 
</P>
<P>
FarWest said it did not lose any money on those investments.

IRREVOCABLE TRUSTS: PITFALLS AS WELL AS BENEFITS; 
</P>
<P>
TAX SHELTERS: KEEPING MEDICAID'S HANDS OFF THE MONEY IS THE KEY FOR THOSE WHO 
FACE LONG-TERM HOSPITALIZATION.

<P>
In the old days, if someone set up a trust, it usually meant that they were 
pretty well off. Nowadays, lawyers often recommend trusts as a money-management 
tool for elderly people with middle-level incomes. 
</P>
<P>
What is a trust? Simply put, it's a way to transfer ownership of your property 
to someone else, a trustee, who will hold and manage those assets for you 
according to the terms of your agreement. 
</P>
<P>
It works this way: You sock money and property into the trust, stipulating how 
and when the principal can be drawn, and how any income from those assets 
should be distributed by the trustee, usually a child or other relative. 
</P>
<P>
Trusts not only provide for ongoing management of your assets in case you 
become disabled, points out lawyer and trust specialist Vincent Russo, but they 
also can be set up to provide for quick distribution of your assets upon death, 
avoiding the lengthy and often costly process of probating a will; help your 
heirs save on estate taxes, and protect your assets in the case of long-term or 
catastrophic illness. 
</P>
<P>
To gain all these benefits, however, you need to create what's called an 
intervivos irrevocable trust or, more specifically, a Medicaid Qualifying 
Trust. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers often suggest this for widows or widowers with, say, $50,000 or 
$100,000 in assets and couples with somewhat larger estates who want to shield 
their assets from the government if they ever have to go into a nursing home. 
Otherwise, at an average cost of $4,000 to $5,000 a month, long-term custodial 
care can quickly deplete your assets before you become eligible for Medicaid. 
In New York, the law now allows healthy spouses to keep up to $60,000 and still 
lets their husbands or wives be institutionalized at Medicaid's expense. 
</P>
<P>
Funds placed in trusts for this purpose should be transferred at least 30 
months before applying for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Sound great? Well, don't expect to have your cake and eat it, too. If the 
government is not going to touch your money, even if you apply for Medicaid, 
the trust must meet certain criteria. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, it must be irrevocable. Once set up, Medicaid Qualifying Trusts 
cannot be altered or revoked, regardless of how circumstances change. So you 
can't get that money back. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the trust must be set up so that your trustee has no discretion in 
terms of invading the assets for you. They can, however, invade the assets for 
someone else, such as a grandchild. If Medicaid feels that you have even remote 
access to your money, they will go after it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where a lot of lawyers make a mistake," said Cleveland attorney Armand 
Bundish, the author of "Avoiding the Medicaid Trap.' "In the last month alone, 
I had three people come in with supposedly Medicaid Qualifying Trusts and in 
all three cases they were done improperly -- the trustee was given discretion 
to provide principal for the grantor -- and the worst thing was, they were 
irrevocable." 
</P>
<P>
You can still arrange to receive the income from the assets in your trust, such 
as interest or dividends from stocks and bonds, to help pay your expenses. But 
if you do, and you then go into a nursing home, that income, though not the 
principal, will go to pay for your care. 
</P>
<P>
Still, lawyers often recommend such income-generating trusts. "This way the 
principal is safe, and hopefully you can live out your life on the income," 
said Charles Robert, a lawyer specializing in the elderly and disabled. "But if 
a health catastrophe occurs and you have to go into a nursing home, your assets 
will be protected." 
</P>
<P>
Why not simply give your assets to your children as gifts, as many people do? 
You can do this -- provided you do so 30 months in advance of applying for 
Medicaid, but since you cannot stipulate, legally, what they must do with the 
assets, your children may decide, instead, to spend it, or they may lose it to 
taxes, theft, legal claims, or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
There also may be tax benefits from a trust, particularly if you're 
transferring assets that have appreciated. "If real estate or stock has gone up 
tremendously in value, it's better for your heirs to get them through a will or 
a trust, because the person only pays capital gains on the value difference 
after the date of death," said David Goldfarb, a New York City lawyer. He 
explained that, if the asset is transferred as a gift, the recipient will 
eventually have to pay capital-gains taxes on the increased value since it was 
originally bought. 
</P>
<P>
So, is an irrevocable trust for you? The answer may depend in large measure on 
your age and health. 
</P>
<P>
"People are living a lot longer than ever before and (often are) in a healthy 
condition at the age of 85," Robert said. "If you have a sickly person, the 
balance weighs toward a trust fund. But (not so) for a healthy senior with 10 
to 20 years of productive life ahead, particularly when there may be other 
alternatives to consider, such as nursing home insurance." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, unless you are sick or over 85, Robert said he thinks it is best to 
sit tight and not get yourself into an irrevocable position right now.

TASTES OF U.S. YUPPIES SPREADING TO EUROPE;

Alligator steaks in Britain, California wines in France and Texas-style 
barbecues in West Germany are part of what some Agriculture Department 
observers say is a move by European yuppies to go up-scale American. 
</P>
<P>
"The marketing niche of young, urban professionals, or yuppies, that originated 
in the United States has spread to Europe as well," says the department's 
Foreign Agricultural Service. 
</P>
<P>
But while sellers in Europe "are targeting young and affluent consumers for 
their upscale consumption and bulging wallets," the agency said it may be a bit 
early to predict whether U.S. exporters can benefit significantly. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the European country, yuppie food tastes have common preferences for 
high quality, convenience and innovation," said Mark Condon, a trade show 
manager for the USDA agency. 
</P>
<P>
"These qualities are part of the market of the future," he said. "In our 
upcoming food exhibits in Europe, we have a lot of the kinds of products that 
would appeal to yuppies." 
</P>
<P>
Those include: low-calorie and low-fat health foods, non-alcoholic beers, 
hickory chips for barbecue fires, ethnic foods, picture-perfect produce, 
California wines, and foods with no preservatives or additives. 
</P>
<P>
"Europeans are market-savvy people," Condon said. "Items must be of top 
quality. They can't be cheap or discounted." 
</P>
<P>
The rise of yuppie food interests in Europe is described in the forthcoming 
December issue of AgExporter magazine published by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
"As in the United States, the European yuppie market is small," the report 
said. "But yuppies are trend-setters and innovators, often the first to try a 
new food or fashion. Later, their tastes and preference trickle down to other 
segments of the population, gradually being adopted by a broader audience." 
</P>
<P>
So it is important to know what European yuppies are currently consuming, the 
report added. Their tastes, however unusual today, could be the general rule 
tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Good, U.S. agricultural trade officer in Hamburg, said the appeal of 
American foods to European yuppies varies from country to country. For example, 
in West Germany the products have to be compatible with German food traditions. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept of eating cuisines from other countries is just emerging," Good 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But in Italy, the opposite seems to be the case, says U.S. agricultural 
counselor for Rome, Frank Piason. The current rage is for ethnic food, 
especially Tex-Mex, in the land of pasta. 
</P>
<P>
"For the Italian yuppie, the focus is on lighter eating and less fatty food," 
Piason said. "The Italian yuppie is likely to consume pasta salad or rice 
salad, rather than pasta, during lunch." 
</P>
<P>
Also, U.S. wines are popular with the young Italians, the report said. That's 
also the case in France. 
</P>
<P>
"While trying to sell U.S. wines in France might seem like bringing coal to 
Newcastle, the French are actually fascinated with U.S. wines," said Holly 
Higgins, who recently completed a two-year assignment as U.S. agricultural 
attache in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
So the "plugged-in group" in France goes for American wines and Tex-Mex 
specialties such as chili and enchiladas, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Microwave ovens also are gaining in France, the land of the long-simmering 
sauce, Higgins said. Changes in life styles, more working women and less time 
for cooking are changing eating habits. 
</P>
<P>
David Mergen, U.S. agricultural attache in Madrid, says, "Yes, Spain does have 
yuppies" and they can be found in the middle of the day at expensive 
restaurants close to where they work. 
</P>
<P>
"Spanish yuppies prefer to eat dishes that are low in cholesterol and they also 
tend to drink lighter alcoholic drinks," Mergen said. "Yuppies drink mineral 
water and fruit juices. They drink wine with meals, however, and gin and tonics 
in the evening." 
</P>
<P>
One of Mergen's colleagues, Isabel Pastor, said the opening of several Madrid 
restaurants that serve American food has helped promote awareness of those 
foods. At least two of the restaurants have names such as "Hollywood" and 
"Boston," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In Britain, the preferences of yuppies are also highly varied and subject to 
changing moods of style and trend, said marketing specialist Christine Chapman 
of the U.S. agricultural trade office in London. But a few of the "in" foods 
are alligator steaks and spicy Creole cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman said organic foods are part of the yuppie menu, along with foreign 
items such as surimi, a processed fish product from Japan, Tex-Mex from the 
United States, and kedgeree, a dish originally from India of rice and chopped 
fish bound together with egg. 
</P>
<P>
"Champagne is high on the list, particularly if it is laced with black currant 
juice or wine," she said. New World wines from the United States and Chile are 
growing in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
Even conservative Switzerland has a yuppie market, according to agricultural 
specialist Hansruedi Bachmann of the U.S. embassy in Bern. More than the 
average consumer, the Swiss yuppie is attracted by U.S. foods, especially 
California wines. 
</P>
<P>
"Swiss yuppies, however, do not eat fast food," Bachmann said. "Instead, they 
frequent luxury restaurants with an upscale, high-quality image."

A WARHOL CHRISTMAS: CLICHED BUT CLEVER

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If somebody found a bunch of shopping lists with doodles by Andy Warhol, you 
can bet they'd be snapped up by some salivating collector and grandly exhibited 
in a burst of fulsome PR. So it isn't surprising that the Center for Decorative 
Arts in San Juan Capistrano is making a fuss over a set of Christmas cards 
Warhol made for Tiffany &amp; Co. in the early 1960s, on view through Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the seemingly low-key, ultratraditional designs for the cards reflect 
some of the central concerns of Warhol's own work. He was, after all, the 
artist who deliberately sought out such banal or well-known subjects as 
Campbell Soup cans, Brillo boxes and the faces of Jackie Kennedy and Marilyn 
Monroe. He presented these subjects as mindlessly repetitive, identical images 
suited to an era of mass media, mass production and mass ennui. 
</P>
<P>
The cards, which Warhol designed while he still worked as a commercial artist, 
offer images of fruit baskets, Christmas trees with birds and baubles, kids 
holding hands, a sled filled with presents -- the most uncreative and cliched 
subjects imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, these subjects were likely to please the average card-buyer looking 
for something pretty and seasonal. A major consumer in his own right (as 
posthumous auctions of his bric-a-brac made clear), Warhol always had a 
brilliant grasp of consumer habits. 
</P>
<P>
The watercolor originals are cheerily executed in the unsettling colors 
(avocado greens, hot pinks) stylish in the late '50s and early '60s. They also 
are full of Warhol-style repetitive imagery: To make the trio of holly leaf, 
fern leaf and mistletoe Christmas trees that appeared on a card from about 1963 
(precise dates apparently are unavailable) Warhol repeated the same four-branch 
segment over and over. The eye reads the juxtaposed branches as a tree, 
although the branches aren't actually connected to each other. 
</P>
<P>
Other images, such as the two designs of Christmas trees made with little 
stars, seem to have been hand-stamped onto the paper -- a primitive form of 
mechanical reproduction. ("Christmas Tree With Continuing Stars" is actually a 
fine little conceptual exercise. The whole paper is dotted with colorful stars 
which "fall" like snow, except where they are printed in close, overlapping 
formation to form the outline of a tree. Warhol's penciled-in triangular 
guidelines are visible under the mass of stars.) 
</P>
<P>
In 1962 Warhol pioneered the concept of having his "paintings" silk-screened by 
assistants rather than painted by (his) hand. So making designs for 
mass-produced cards was right up his alley. 
</P>
<P>
Even the fact that they were made to be sold by a ritzy Fifth Avenue jewelry 
store probably suited him to a T. As others have pointed out, Warhol's art was 
the reflection of an affluent society. Wealthy people shelled out more for 
Warhol's screen-printed portraits of themselves than they would have paid for 
ordinary, painstakingly hand-painted portraits. 
</P>
<P>
So, far from merely being a hungry artist's potboilers or curiously banal 
mementoes of a world-beating career, the cards are full-fledged pieces of 
Warholiana. And it just so happens that Tiffany's is reissuing two cards each 
year beginning this Christmas -- a savvy move in an era that once again is 
likely to ooh and ah over the sweetly traditional motifs. But we know better. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen Christmas card drawings by Andy Warhol are at the Center for the 
Study of Decorative Arts through Dec. 23, along with Christmas trees decorated 
by 10 designers. The center, at 31431 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano, 
is open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. A $3 donation is 
requested. Information: (714) 496-2132.

<P>
Like a magician's top hat, "Wand," a holiday musical closing this weekend at 
the Newport Theatre Arts Center, is full of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Written and directed by Linda Ballew with music by Terence Alaric, "Wand" 
updates "The Magical Wand of Baledi," a feel-good fantasy brimming with 
colorful characters and hummable tunes that Ballew and Alaric premiered at NTAC 
last December. This year's version features a new choreography by Marie de la 
Palme (formerly with the Alvin Ailey Dance Theatre Workshop) and several new 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
Alaric's tunes (especially "High 5's and "I Ate 'Em) and De La Palme's dance 
steps are snappy, and Ballew's story is engaging as ever. It goes something 
like this: 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time, in a glitzy but painfully boring New York apartment, four 
kids (Brian Kiser, Tyler Morgan, Katy Grumbles and Alison Arnold) acquire a 
magic wand from a bumbling magician named Alexander (real-life illusionist 
Scott Ratner). But Alexander's rabbit (Amber Reaves) points out how much 
trouble the gift could cause in inexperienced hands, and Alexander tries to 
retrieve the wand only to tangle with Maldetto (Eddie Rivera), an evil sorcerer 
who has had his eye on the wand for years and who isn't above using black magic 
to get it. With the wand, Maldetto sends the kids packing on their own 
wild-but-ill-fated fantasies, much to the dismay of Mom (Francoise Conrad). In 
the end, it's up to Alexander to overcome his self-doubt and save the day, but 
. . . well, you get the picture. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the theme of the story is 'the magic is in you,' " Ballew said, 
"meaning we all have the power within us to do whatever we want." Ballew, who 
has created children's plays for groups in Texas and Oregon, has coordinated 
acting classes at NTAC for the past three years. "The Magical Wand of Baledi" 
was her first Orange County production and her first collaboration with Alaric, 
who has composed tunes for eight other NTAC shows. 
</P>
<P>
In creating the show, Ballew and Alaric were given two guidelines by NTAC 
administrators. To save on production costs, the holiday story had to be told 
on the set of NTAC's most recent production. And, in recognition of their 
subscribers' diverse ethnic background, there could be no mention of Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"I remembered when I was living in New York with my daughter," Ballew said in 
explaining how she came up with the story. "She hated it because she said it 
was a 'grown-up city.' So I had this concept of four bored kids in a boring 
apartment, trying to escape through their fantasies." 
</P>
<P>
The 12-member cast features seven youngsters aged 6 to 14, many of them drawn 
from NTAC's children's musical theatre classes, and five local adult actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wand" runs Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights at 7:30 at the Newport 
Theatre Arts Center, 2501 Cliff Drive, Newport Beach. All tickets are $5.

STATE DELAYS DECISION ON SAN ONOFRE DISCHARGE; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD MAY HOLD A JOINT HEARING 
WITH THE COASTAL COMMISSION TO LOOK AT POSSIBLE POLLUTION VIOLATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The state Regional Water Quality Control Board on Monday tabled a decision 
about whether the San Onofre nuclear plant is violating its federal 
pollutant-discharge permit. 
</P>
<P>
The status report briefing was prompted by a presentation made in October by 
two students from the Environmental Law Clinic of the University of San Diego 
School of Law, who asked the water board to respond to the findings of a 
15-year, $46-million study that show the plant is violating two sections of its 
discharge permit, which the water board has the power to issue or revoke. 
</P>
<P>
The students requested that the water board revoke San Onofre's permit until 
Southern California Edison reduces the amount of sea water sucked into and 
spewed out of the plant -- now 200 million gallons a minute -- by building 
cooling towers. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the water board resolved only to consider holding a joint hearing on 
the issue with the California Coastal Commission, which created the Marine 
Review Committee in 1974 to compile the extensive report on the nuclear plant. 
The commission is weighing a variety of options to soften what the report found 
to be substantial environmental damage caused by the nuclear plant. 
</P>
<P>
The briefing room for Monday's meeting quickly became a battleground, however. 
</P>
<P>
On one side were two Edison officials and four paid Edison consultants, as well 
as one of the report's authors, who was assigned to the committee to represent 
the utility's interests. On the other side were the two law students and 
another of the report's authors, who represented the environmentalists' views 
on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
Frank L. Melone, an Edison environmental affairs spokesman, suggested that the 
Marine Review Committee study would not withstand the scrutiny of the 
scientific community at large, and he compared it to the work of two Utah 
scientists who recently claimed that they had discovered cold nuclear fusion -- 
a contention that is now largely dismissed by physicists. 
</P>
<P>
"The work those two individuals had done has since that time undergone peer 
review, and their claims just didn't hold up," Melone said, clearly suggesting 
that the MRC study could meet the same fate. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. William W. Murdoch, a biologist with the University of California at 
Santa Barbara and one of three authors of the study, called Melone's assertion 
ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
"That's silly. If you're going to argue with science, you should argue by 
bringing in results that support your view," he said, pointing out that the MRC 
study was conducted by more than 100 scientists and reviewed independently by 
another 100 biologists and other marine experts before the final report was 
released in August. 
</P>
<P>
And Dr. Rimmon C. Fay, who represented environmentalists' interests on the 
committee, said the report's results are accurate. 
</P>
<P>
"Enough samples were counted that you could have confidence in the results 
according to statistical data," he said. "So it's good evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Among the adverse effects the report found is a 60%, or 200-acre, reduction in 
the area covered by the nearby San Onofre kelp bed. The report also found that 
the plant's cooling system sucks up and kills 21 tons to 57 tons of fish 
yearly, then discharges debris-filled water into the ocean, reducing natural 
light levels on the ocean floor by as much as 16%.

CITY SAYS SETTLEMENT OF SEWER SUIT IS NEAR; EPA LAWYER IS LESS OPTIMISTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The city of San Diego is nearing a settlement in its 17-month legal battle with 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, an agreement that could be concluded 
by the end of the week, a city attorney said during a federal court hearing 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The city thinks we are close to being able to settle this case in the next 
four or five days, or know whether a settlement can occur," Jim Dragna, a 
private attorney representing the city, told U.S. District Judge Rudi Brewster 
during a pretrial hearing on the EPA's demand that San Diego upgrade its sewage 
treatment system. 
</P>
<P>
But an attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice, which represents the EPA, 
was less optimistic, telling Brewster that "very serious disagreements" remain 
between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald George, senior counsel for the Justice Department, said in an interview 
that the issue of how the city will stem continued spills from its system 
remains an obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA and the state sued the city last year for missing a July, 1988, 
deadline for compliance with the federal Clean Water Act and for spilling 
untreated sewage into local waterways since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The agencies are demanding that San Diego upgrade its treatment system from the 
"advanced primary" level, which removes 75% to 80% of solids from effluent, to 
"secondary" level, which removes 85% to 90% of the solids. 
</P>
<P>
City planners and consultants have drawn up plans for a $2.6-billion to 
$2.8-billion treatment system that would be the largest public works project 
ever undertaken by the city. The EPA is not challenging the design of the 
system, but in court documents filed last month demanded that the city build it 
by December, 1999. In corresponding documents, the city contended that it could 
not complete the mammoth construction project until August, 2007. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, however, city attorneys offered to complete the system sometime 
during 2004, and to build a large-scale sewage cleanup project in lieu of a 
fine of as much as $3 million, City Hall sources have said. 
</P>
<P>
If the two sides cannot settle the case, Brewster will set the start-up date 
after a trial that is scheduled to begin Jan. 9 and could last two to three 
weeks. Later, a separate trial on penalties for past sewage spills would be 
held. 
</P>
<P>
Dragna said in an interview that the two sides still are negotiating on a 
start-up date for the system. George would not comment on the negotiations. 
Robert Simmons, an attorney for the Sierra Club, which has been granted 
intervenor status, described the two sides as "a hair's breadth away" from a 
settlement.

SIMI VALLEY COUNCIL TENTATIVELY OKS ANTI-GRAFFITI LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to stem vandalism and discourage what officials say is rising gang 
activity, the Simi Valley City Council on Monday tentatively approved an 
ordinance banning the sale of spray paint to minors and authorizing the city to 
eliminate graffiti from private property. 
</P>
<P>
"Graffiti is not just an eyesore, but part of the process by which gangs take 
claim to territory," said Simi Valley Mayor Gregory Stratton. "We'd like to 
suppress it as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance, which is similar to measures enacted recently in Los 
Angeles, Beverly Hills and Thousand Oaks, would give private property owners 10 
days after notification by the city to remove the graffiti themselves or give 
the city written permission to do the job. It also authorizes the city to 
assess property owners for cleanup costs and, if necessary, prosecute those who 
do not cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
Stratton said gangs are not a major problem in the bedroom community of just 
under 100,000 residents, but, "We'd like to stop it before it gets started." He 
also said there is the fear in Simi Valley, as there is elsewhere in Ventura 
County, of encroaching gang violence from Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
That fear is borne out by recent incidents, according to Kevin McGee, assistant 
chief deputy district attorney, who said gangs "use walls and buildings as 
their bulletin boards." Although he was unable to provide statistics, McGee 
said gang activity has been increasing in Ventura County, some of it local, 
some from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
McGee said an adult and a minor, both identified as Los Angeles gang members, 
were recently prosecuted in connection with a series of armed robberies in Simi 
Valley. Thousand Oaks this year experienced a drive-by shooting and, in a 
separate incident, a stabbing at The Oaks mall. Both were gang-related, McGee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Schreiner, an assistant city attorney for Thousand Oaks, said an 
anti-graffiti ordinance adopted last summer was not prompted by gangs but by 
vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Police Chief Lindsey (Paul) Miller said: "We don't really have 
gangs per se at this point, just a lot of 'wannabes,' or kids who want to be in 
gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti "at this point is more of a visual nuisance than anything else," he 
said. "Once people get used to seeing it, it becomes commonplace. We want a 
community where graffiti definitely is not a common thing." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley's code-enforcement staff documented 23 incidents of graffiti 
between April and October. But code-enforcement Director Jocelyn Reed said 
comparisons to prior years are not possible because the city did not keep track 
of graffiti separately from other vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen of the cases have been remedied, but seven involving uncooperative 
property owners remain unresolved, Reed said. The city's new anti-graffiti 
ordinance would allow prosecution of the property owners if they do not 
cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the measure would prohibit minors from buying or possessing spray 
paint, except under the supervision of a responsible adult. If a minor is 
arrested for graffiti vandalism, parents or guardians would be responsible for 
the cost of its removal. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance also would authorize the city to pay rewards for information 
leading to the arrest and conviction of graffiti vandals. 
</P>
<P>
The abatement program, to be handled by the city's Public Works staff, is 
expected to cost $23,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is expected to be adopted after a second reading at the council's 
Jan. 8 meeting, Stratton said.

COURT OFFICIALS NOT SO MERRY OVER JUDGE'S CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA KLEIN LERNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Beverly Hills attorney sitting as a volunteer judge in Van Nuys spread a 
little Christmas cheer Monday by suspending the fines of dozens of traffic 
violators, asking them to donate the money to a charity toy drive instead. 
</P>
<P>
But the attorney's high spirits fell somewhat when he learned that the 
presiding Municipal Court judge is looking into his charity spree as a possible 
violation of judicial ethics. 
</P>
<P>
While playing Santa, attorney Perry C. Wander dismissed arrest warrants against 
people who had failed to appear in court and suspended fines for people accused 
of traffic infractions such as driving with expired car registrations and 
running a stop sign. 
</P>
<P>
Wander said he gave breaks to dozens of people, saving some as much as $230 in 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
"If you had to be in court, this was the day," said one courtroom spectator who 
asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspended all the fines that people owed the court and conditioned their 
suspension on people buying toys and donating them to the CHP's toy drive. I 
told them that they were getting a Christmas present," said Wander, 34, who has 
a general practice in real estate, corporate and business law. 
</P>
<P>
Wander's elderly grandparents, visiting from New York, sat in the courtroom and 
later reported to a gleeful Wander that those sentenced by him agreed he was 
the best judge they'd ever seen, Wander said. 
</P>
<P>
Wander even called The Times in hopes of publicizing his actions. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was laughing, everyone was saying 'Merry Christmas' and everyone was 
thanking me," Wander said happily. "I got my bachelor's degree in social work 
and have always wanted to help people. This was a place where I could get into 
the spirit of things and help somebody." 
</P>
<P>
But Wander's largess brought no holiday cheer to Larry P. Fidler, presiding 
judge of the Los Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
Wander's "actions appear to be completely unacceptable," said Fidler, who 
learned of the incident through calls from court employees. "This court will 
not stand for that type of behavior. It doesn't matter if it's kindhearted. You 
cannot dismiss tickets because someone gives to a charity." 
</P>
<P>
"He used very poor judgment," Fidler said. 
</P>
<P>
The judge added that he will review an tape recording of Wander's morning on 
the bench to determine whether he should remove Wander from the list of 
temporary judges or report him to the State Bar of California. 
</P>
<P>
Tape recordings are made of all proceedings involving the 2,000 volunteer, 
temporary judges who preside over some civil, small claims, traffic and 
landlord-tenant cases as part of a program to save the county money. 
</P>
<P>
All attend a special training course, said Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge 
Karl W. Jaeger, chairman of a committee that oversees the judges. 
</P>
<P>
"I must assume he's been through our training and must have slept through the 
ethics course," said Jaeger. 
</P>
<P>
But Wander defended his actions, saying he was within his judicial discretion. 
</P>
<P>
"A judge imposing a sentence can attach reasonable conditions. You can suspend 
fines, you always have that discretion," said Wander, adding, "I didn't dismiss 
any drunk driving, anything involved in accidents. Nobody that deserved to have 
a fine assessed was not fined." 
</P>
<P>
Wander also pointed out that he did not dismiss the cases but merely suspended 
fines. The infractions would still remain on a person's driving record, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wander said he did not require contributions as a condition of sentencing but 
simply reminded defendants that he'd saved them money and made them promise to 
make donations. He said he gave defendants a CHP phone number for information 
about the toy drive. 
</P>
<P>
But Fidler said a judge has authority to suspend a sentence only "in the 
furtherance of justice," and said he does not believe that occurred here. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't suspend a fine for anything but for a proper reason," said Fidler. 
"I would hope we all would have warm feelings and want to do good for our 
fellow man, but we can't suspend the law. No judge has that kind of authority." 
</P>
<P>
Wander, who graduated eight years ago from the University of San Fernando 
Valley College of Law in Van Nuys, said he got the idea for the unusual 
sentencing when he saw a CHP display for the toy drive while shopping in 
Century City. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Christmas," he said.

CSUN FACULTY SPLIT ON CHINA EXCHANGE PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
TEACHING: THE CONFLICT IS OVER A CONTRACT WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO TRAIN 
EDUCATORS. SOME SAY IT ENDORSES A REPRESSIVE REGIME WHILE OTHERS SAY IT 
PROVIDES ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Cal State Northridge faculty members are raising questions about campus efforts 
to win a $3.3-million contract from the Chinese government, saying the campaign 
by school officials gives the appearance of support for the totalitarian 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN officials this fall applied to China's State Education Commission to 
become administrators of a portion of a $50-million World Bank loan earmarked 
for the overhaul of the country's secondary education system. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of new teachers are needed in China as part of an long-range 
plan to expand compulsory education from six to nine years, campus officials 
said. CSUN, which was visited by a delegation of Chinese this fall as part of 
the selection process, is one of four universities compet ing to operate the 
teacher-training program. The other three are Ohio State University, Columbia 
University Teacher's College and the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education 
in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
But faculty critics say the campus efforts could be viewed as lending support 
to the government that in June killed scores of students in Beijing's Tian An 
Men Square. President George Bush last week received similar criticism for 
sending National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State 
Lawrence Eagleburger to meet with Chinese officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a gamble," said Lawrence Littwin, a political science professor. "On the 
one hand, involvement with China is good, it does expose us to people there. 
But our participating legitimizes the government of China." 
</P>
<P>
Littwin and other faculty members have written a policy statement that says any 
effort to establish educational links with China "in no way indicates that this 
university condones the policies repressing the free expression of ideas" by 
the Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
Faculty Senate President Henry Abrash said Monday that he and colleagues had 
originally sought to ban all academic exchanges with China until the government 
there granted more freedom to its citizens. But other faculty members argued 
that such exchanges can be catalysts for political change, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our help in education is ultimately beneficial, but I think there is a real 
danger that our presence there can be used for propaganda purposes," Abrash 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed statement, which is to be voted on by the faculty Senate in 
February, is opposed by CSUN professors who have close ties with China and who 
are seeking to participate in the teacher-training program. 
</P>
<P>
"Academic exchange has nothing to do with the government's policies," said 
I-Shou Wang, chairman of the CSUN geography department. "We are supporting the 
people of China." 
</P>
<P>
Physics Prof. Paul Chow, who is credited with helping the university establish 
ties with more than a dozen Chinese universities in the last 12 years, said he 
opposes the proposed policy because it takes a moral position that not all 
faculty members share. 
</P>
<P>
"It is wrong to impose the ideas of a few people on more than 1,000 faculty 
members," Chow said. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN President James W. Cleary said through a spokeswoman that he does not 
support the Chinese government, but does support intellectual exchange. He 
declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
But other campus officials concede that CSUN is trying to walk a line between 
attempting to please the Chinese government to win the contract and wanting to 
expand educational opportunities for Chinese students, which many say could 
propel change in the current Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy," said Angela Lew, director of the school's China Institute. 
"But if we can somehow promote the spreading of knowledge, that will move the 
country one step closer to democratization." 
</P>
<P>
Lew said there was no mention of the student massacre in Beijing when a 
three-member Chinese delegation came to the campus in October for an inspection 
tour related to the World Bank program. 
</P>
<P>
"No one on this trip talked about politics," Lew said. "We do not want to 
offend the government and shut the door." 
</P>
<P>
World Bank officials, who approved the loan prior to the June 4 military 
crackdown, said Monday that they do not know when the Chinese will select the 
university to run the teacher-training program. 
</P>
<P>
A State Department official said Monday the Bush Administration continues to 
support such academic exchanges with China. 
</P>
<P>
In the CSUN proposal, more than 90 professors from universities throughout the 
country would train more than 200 visiting Chinese scholars in the United 
States and scores of others in China during the program's four years. Those 
Chinese scholars would train teachers at institutions throughout China.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 12th in a series of video store robberies occurred just after 10 a.m. 
Monday, police said. Since September, video stores in National City, Chula 
Vista and San Diego have been robbed, apparently by the same person, San Diego 
police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest store to be hit was Blockbuster Video in the 3000 block of 
Clairemont Drive in San Diego. A man in his late 30s, wearing a camouflage hat, 
blue sweat shirt and gray running shoes, showed a handgun to employees and made 
off with an undisclosed amount of money, Robinson said. Although the attire has 
been different, the physical descriptions of the person have been similar, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Jerry Moody said the robberies occurred within the same three-hour time 
frame, adding that all but three of the stores have been part of the 
Blockbuster chain. The store robbed Monday was also the first store robbed, on 
Sept. 26, Moody said.

TEEN-AGER SHOT OUTSIDE LA JOLLA YMCA CLUB 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An 18-year-old man was in serious condition Monday after being shot in the 
stomach outside a La Jolla youth club following an argument with two other men, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny McClure was in the Firehouse Teen and Youth Center about 11 p.m. 
Saturday when the argument began. Security personnel asked the men to leave, 
said Elaine Andersen, operations manager of the under-21 club. She said McClure 
stayed inside for a while after the others left. He was shot as he walked down 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
Two shots were fired from a red Volkswagen Scirocco, and one of them hit 
McClure, said police spokesman Bill Robinson. McClure was taken to Scripps 
Memorial Hospital in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Andersen said it was the first time a shooting had occurred in the area around 
the 7-month-old club, part of the La Jolla YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't serve alcohol here. We play music and have a light show." 
</P>
<P>
She said McClure had been in the club before, but the other two men were not 
known to the patrons or the security officers. 
</P>
<P>
"The young men were having an argument, and they ended it here. . . . It's a 
horrible thing that happened," she said. YOLANDA RODRIGUEZ

LA JOLLA INSTITUTIONS TO CREATE BRAIN RESEARCH CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
UC San Diego, the Research Institute of Scripps Clinic and the Salk Institute 
have been awarded a $1.2-million, three-year grant to create and operate a 
center that will study perception, language and memory. 
</P>
<P>
The institutions will use grant money from the James S. McDonnell Foundation of 
St. Louis and the Pew Charitable Trusts of Philadelphia to fund the Center for 
Cognitive Neuroscience, where "students at each institution can . . . 
participate with the senior staff in interdisciplinary research," said a 
spokeswoman for the charitable trusts. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the institutions, all in La Jolla, are studying aspects of 
neuroscience, but the center will focus specifically on brain functions that 
govern learning and attention. 
</P>
<P>
The award is part of a $12-million program to advance mind-brain research. 
Similar grants were awarded to the University of Arizona, Dartmouth College, 
Johns Hopkins University, Montreal Neurological Institute, the University of 
Oregon, Oxford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
The grant marked yet another example of collaborative effort among researchers 
at the three La Jolla-based institutions. Earlier this year, UCSD and Scripps 
Clinic hired organic chemist Kyriacos C. Nicolaou to serve as a UCSD professor 
and head of Scripps' new chemistry department. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, UCSD Chancellor Richard Atkinson said the joint appointment marked 
a "new era of cooperation" between the university and Scripps. 
</P>
<P>
Terrence J. Sejnowski, director of the Salk Institute's Computational 
Neurobiology Laboratory, will direct the center's operations. Sejnowski is also 
as a professor of biology and physics at UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
The grant will support eight graduate students and four post-doctoral fellows.

ARGENTINA TO FLOAT AUSTRAL: Argentina's new economy minister, Antonio Erman 
Gonzalez, announced that the country's currency, the austral, will be allowed 
to float against the dollar and that all foreign-exchange controls will be 
scrapped as part of a plan to beat the country's hyper-inflation. In a speech 
made just after being sworn in by President Carlos Menem, Gonzalez said he also 
would end all price controls as well as an 11% rise in duty on farm exports 
that his predecessor, Nestor Rapanelli, announced last week. He did not specify 
when the new measures would take effect.

Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden said Monday that 
he is creating an International Affairs office to coordinate enforcement 
cooperation with foreign stock regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Breeden announced the new office at a news conference where he reported on 
cooperative agreements reached last week with securities regulators in France 
and the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
The new Office of International Affairs will be headed by Michael D. Mann, now 
an associate director for international affairs in the SEC's Enforcement 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Breeden said the new office, which will be responsible for negotiating formal 
cooperation agreements, known as memoranda of understanding, "underlines the 
very high priority the commission places on international cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
Last week Breeden signed cooperation agreements with Dutch and French 
securities regulators that will allow the exchange of information to help stamp 
out insider trading and other market abuses. 
</P>
<P>
Breeden said the French agreement is contingent upon the passage of legislation 
pending before Congress that would allow the SEC to guarantee foreign 
authorities that confidential information they supply to U.S. investigators 
would be kept confidential in this country.

SAUDI ARABIA WANTS TO REFINE OIL IN JAPAN

Saudi Arabia, which has the world's largest supply of crude oil, wants to start 
oil refining and marketing in Japan, a move that may force reorganization of 
Japan's oil industry, a leading economic journal says. 
</P>
<P>
Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported Sunday that Saudi Arabia has already sounded out 
the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry as well as the 
Resources and Energy Agency about the possibility. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government is ready to cooperate with Saudi Arabia on the 
condition that it allow Japanese participation in oil development projects, 
agree to a stable supply of crude oil in the event of a crisis and contribute 
to the improvement of the Japanese oil industry, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
Masashi Yamamoto, director of the Resources and Energy Agency, will visit Saudi 
Arabia in January to prepare for high-level negotiations on the project in 
March, the daily said. 
</P>
<P>
It said Saudi Arabia is strongly interested in steady growth of oil demand in 
Japan and wants to establish a government-financed oil refining and 
distribution system to compete against major U.S. and European oil firms. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis' direct entry into the Japanese market may intensify competition and 
trigger reorganization of the domestic industry, the daily said. 
</P>
<P>
The timing and scale of the Saudi project were not known, but it would take at 
least two to three years to come through, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi oil minister Hisham Nazer said in September that his country plans to 
refine and sell petroleum products worldwide, especially in Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia bought a 50% share of three Texaco Inc. 
refineries in Saudi Arabia and 10,000 service stations in the Eastern United 
States for $2 billion to help the third-largest U.S. oil company fight a 
takeover attempt.

SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES: IMPERIAL CORP. OF AMERICA REPORTS CAPITAL DEFICIENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imperial Corp. of America said Monday that additional losses sustained by its 
already battered junk bond portfolio has resulted in a negative tangible net 
worth for the troubled San Diego-based parent company of Imperial Savings of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators have been fully informed of ICA's "capital deficiency" but 
there are no indications as yet that regulators may seize control of the 
S&amp;L, ICA spokesman Bruce Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
Tangible net worth, or core capital less good will, is one of three capital 
adequacy tests applied to thrifts in the wake of last summer's S&amp;L rescue 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
According to the minimum standards in the bill, ICA's core capital is supposed 
to equal at least $150 million, or 1.5% of its $10.5 billion assets. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn declined to specify what ICA's negative tangible net worth now totals. 
</P>
<P>
ICA's junk bonds declined in value by $51.7 million from Sept. 30 to Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
During its third quarter ended Sept. 30, ICA was forced to write down the value 
of its junk bonds by a total of $147.6 million to adhere to new regulatory 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
The value of the portfolio is now about $860 million, down from $1.2 billion on 
June 30, Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our earnings and capital ratios are captive to the junk bond market right 
now," Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
ICA expects to realize a gain of up to $60 million by the impending sale of its 
credit card operation to Wells Fargo, but Dunn could not say whether the gain 
would push ICA's tangible net worth back to positive. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Corp. of America also announced that it has settled five shareholder 
lawsuits that alleged that ICA misrepresented and made inadequate disclosures 
concerning asset problems that later resulted in significant losses. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement to shareholders totaled $13 million, all but $500,000 of which 
will be paid by ICA's insurers, ICA said. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement will be paid, after of legal costs, to shareholders who 
purchased ICA stock between March, 1987, and January, 1989, Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement also includes the payment to plaintiffs of 1.5-million warrants 
for the purchase of one share of common stock. CHRIS KRAUL

SAN DIEGO INDUSTRY NOTES

<P>
 A U.S. District Judge has limited to $2.5 million the damages owed by Mail 
Boxes Etc. to a former shareholder who successfully sued the San Diego company 
for misrepresenting the value of his stock. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged misrepresentation occured just before the shareholder's sale of 
shares back to the company in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Mail Boxes must also pay $750,000 in attorneys' fees to the plaintiff, the 
judge ruled. 
</P>
<P>
In September, a jury awarded $4 million to family members of Gerald Aul, a Mail 
Boxes Etc. co-founder. 
</P>
<P>
The award was broken down into $2.5 million owed to Aul by the company and $1.5 
million owed by Mail Boxes chief executive Tony De Sio. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the court ruled that Mail Boxes faces a maximum liability of $2.5 
million plus legal costs, De Sio said. 
</P>
<P>
If Mail Boxes loses a planned appeal, it would be forced to pay $2.25 million, 
since $1 million of the liability is covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The liability works out to an after-tax cost to shareholders of about 35 cents 
a share, company sources said.

TOUR FIRM'S WOES RISE AT CLIENTS' EXPENSE; 
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL: ENCINO'S HEMPHILL HARRIS TRAVEL FACES CUSTOMERS' GRIPES, LAWSUITS AND 
LOSS OF A ONCE-STERLING REPUTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Erwin Smith, a retired engineer, and his wife, Betty, were 7,500 miles from 
home on the Indonesian island of Bali in October as part of a 29-day vacation. 
The Lompoc couple paid for their accommodations up front, having given $14,000 
to Hemphill Harris Travel Corp., an Encino firm known as one of the major 
operators of luxury overseas tours. 
</P>
<P>
Everything was supposed to be arranged. But the next thing Erwin Smith knew, he 
was reaching for his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
After Bali, the Smiths and several other Americans were supposed to fly to Hong 
Kong, their last stop. But on Oct. 18, the day before their flight, they got a 
telegram from Hemphill. 
</P>
<P>
Hemphill, running out of cash, had canceled the rest of their tour. The Hong 
Kong hotels where the group planned to stay were already owed money by Hemphill 
and were no longer accepting the travelers' prepayment vouchers. So the 
Americans either had to pay for the rest of their stay themselves, or fly home 
immediately (their airline tickets were still valid). 
</P>
<P>
"I was really shocked," Erwin Smith said. "My first reaction was, 'We'll go 
home tomorrow.' " Later, though, the group finished the trip "because we were 
clear over there," he said, adding that he spent an extra $600 to complete the 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Hemphill said it canceled tours escorting at least 70 Americans in the 
Orient, Australia, Thailand, India and elsewhere. But the number of people 
affected was probably higher. Travel agents said other trips were canceled 
before tourists left the United States. The U.S. Tour Operators Assn., a trade 
group in New York, received calls from 100 people asking for help in getting 
refunds after their Hemphill tours were scrapped, said USTOA President Robert 
E. Whitley. 
</P>
<P>
And though the cancellations caught the customers and their travel agents by 
surprise, there were signs last spring that all was not well with Hemphill, 
which is owned by Weststar Acquisition Corp. in New York. Since then, 
Hemphill's problems have only mounted, badly tarnishing the firm's reputation 
as a premier tour operator. 
</P>
<P>
Overseas creditors -- the foreign hotels and tour operators that helped 
Hemphill organize its trips -- have filed several lawsuits in state and federal 
court in Los Angeles, alleging that Hemphill still owes them at least $1.7 
million. Last month, the landlord for Hemphill's Encino headquarters filed a 
complaint in Superior Court, claiming Hemphill was behind a month's rent of 
$21,600. 
</P>
<P>
Individual travelers such as the Smiths complain that they can't get refunds, 
even though Hemphill promised refunds to anyone affected by the canceled tours. 
The complaints have prompted the California attorney general's office to 
investigate Hemphill, although Herschel Elkins, head of the attorney general's 
consumer law section in Los Angeles, said, "I don't know if there's been any 
violation of law as yet." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most important, some travel agents -- the ones who steer travelers to 
one tour operator or another -- have decided to just say no to Hemphill. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly would never book with them again," said Nancy Pole-Wilhite, 
international supervisor for Beaverton Travel in Beaverton, Ore., a Portland 
suburb. She said she's tried for weeks to get $28,000 in refunds for four 
clients whose trips were canceled by Hemphill, to no avail. "They disconnected 
their fax, they disconnected their '800' number," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Rockow, owner of Airtours Cruises and Travel Service in Encino, also said 
he would not recommend Hemphill. "They're having trouble meeting their 
obligations, according to reports in the trade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another Oregon agent, Alice Sabin of Ambassador Travel in Eugene, said she has 
clients who are still owed $15,000 by Hemphill. Sabin even made a personal 
visit to Hemphill's headquarters, but officials "were always in conference or 
out" of the office, she said. 
</P>
<P>
David Dukesherer, chief executive of Weststar and president of Hemphill -- and 
the man who signed the telegrams sent to the stranded tourists in October -- 
did not return repeated phone calls seeking comment for this story. Neither did 
lawyer Jack Staitman, who is defending Hemphill in several of the lawsuits, nor 
did Michael Jay, a Weststar vice president who was the company's main spokesman 
when the tours were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Until this year, Hemphill, whose tours cost an average of about $4,000, was a 
thriving operation with, reportedly, about $70 million a year in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Hemphill Harris was considered one of the best, one of the innovators in 
deluxe travel," said Charles Kao, executive vice president of SpeedTravel Inc., 
a Hong 
</P>
<P>
Kong-based tour operator with offices in Santa Monica. Hotels and restaurants 
worldwide "had the utmost respect for them, for the business they generated," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
That's all changed, said H.G. (Red) MacKenzie, vice president of the Western 
region of the American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA), a trade group. "Until 
they establish credibility again, it will be difficult for the travel agents to 
start doing business with them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some of Hemphill's latest moves only further clouded its status. Last 
month, Weststar, which had owned Hemphill since a year ago, said it had sold 
Hemphill to a company called Gala World Corp. for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
What's Gala World? Executives in the travel industry said they don't know, and 
the California secretary of state's office shows no records of incorporation 
for such a company. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody seems to know much about" Gala World, said MacKenzie. Added Whitley, "I 
don't know what to make of it." 
</P>
<P>
The confusion grew last week, when TravelAge West, a trade publication, 
reported that Weststar had bought back Hemphill from Gala World, but that Gala 
World had assumed Hemphill's debts and planned to pay refunds to Hemphill's 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
Until a year ago, the firm, founded in 1977, had been owned by Ron Harris, John 
Hemphill and Joseph Lavitt. They sold it to Weststar, an investor group that 
had never been in the travel business before, and the three agreed to stay on 
to run the firm. 
</P>
<P>
But signs began emerging that Hemphill Harris was running into problems. In the 
spring, Harris and Weststar sued each other for allegedly breaching their 
contract. Harris and Hemphill soon quit and the tour operators' trade group 
tossed Hemphill out of its organization in July because of the management 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
According to Weststar, a major blow came in June, when the Chinese government's 
crackdown on civil unrest left Hemphill unable to conduct its tours. Hemphill, 
having already forwarded its customers' money to China to set up the tours, 
suddenly could not get it back. Yet the firm had to give its customers refunds. 
</P>
<P>
The result: Hemphill was out millions of dollars, creating "a severe cash 
shortage" at the firm, Weststar's Jay said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
In July and August, several hotel chains with overseas sites -- Hilton, 
Mandarin Oriental, Shangri-La International and Regent International -- filed 
lawsuits in Superior Court in Los Angeles seeking payment for services they 
provided Hemphill. Tour operators in Egypt and Canada did likewise in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
In some of the suits, the hotels claimed they received some payments from 
Hemphill, only to have Hemphill's checks bounce. And in some cases, Hemphill 
denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Where does Hemphill go from here? Earlier this month Dukesherer told TravelAge 
West that Hemphill will keep operating and is looking for new investors. A 
telephone receptionist at Hemphill's headquarters said the firm is booking 
tours for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Smiths, they had paid $100 for insurance that would have reimbursed 
them if they had canceled their tour, but their policy did not cover a default 
by the tour operator. The latter insurance is also available, travel officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So the Smiths are still waiting for Hemphill to refund the $600 they spent to 
finish their October tour. The Smiths said Hemphill did contact them once, 
however. The firm mailed them a questionnaire asking how they liked their trip.

DEMISE OF WESTLAKE THRIFT CITED AS CLASSIC BANK FRAUD; 
</P>
<P>
SAVINGS AND LOANS: INVESTIGATION INTO RISE AND FALL OF LENDING INSTITUTION 
UNCOVERS LARGE-SCALE FRAUD SCHEME INVOLVING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BOGUS LOANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The first years of the 1980s were a boom time for Westlake Thrift &amp; Loan of 
Westlake Village as it grew into a company of more than 100 employees with 
almost $100 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
Automobile loans were a company specialty. The word was out that Westlake 
Thrift virtually wanted to corner the car-loan market in Ventura County, and it 
almost succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
"They grew by taking a lot of low-quality loans. They were writing $64 million 
in auto loans a year," one government official said. "An 18-year-old kid with 
no credit could finance a new Cadillac through Westlake, and every car dealer 
in the county knew it." 
</P>
<P>
But something was drastically wrong. In July, 1988, Westlake Thrift went out of 
business. Federal regulators gave no reason for the collapse, and the exact 
nature of the company's many problems was not initially disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
What also was not disclosed at the time was that much more than questionable 
banking practices was involved in both the rise and fall of Westlake Thrift. 
</P>
<P>
An FBI investigation already was well under way into allegations that at least 
one bank official was part of a large-scale fraud scheme involving millions of 
dollars in bogus loans -- some of them written to people who never existed. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the story of Westlake Thrift's demise became clearer as the 
financial institution's former president, Steven Smith, 46, of Thousand Oaks, 
pleaded guilty in federal court in Los Angeles to charges of conspiracy, fraud 
and misapplication of bank funds. 
</P>
<P>
Even as Smith was entering his guilty pleas, the FBI and the U.S. attorney's 
office in Los Angeles were pressing forward with their inquiry into Westlake 
Thrift, as well as the activities of some officials of the thrift's parent 
company, United Community Bank of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
It is too early to say where the investigation will lead, officials said. 
Already, however, court documents and interviews provide a detailed account of 
what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
In sketching the anatomy of a thrift and loan collapse, federal officials begin 
the story with Walter Vladovich, 55, a Riverside businessman who allegedly set 
out in the mid-1980s to build the largest chain of video stores in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Vladovich, the lead defendant in a 26-count federal bank fraud indictment 
returned earlier this month, has pleaded not guilty to all charges that he 
conspired with Smith and others to set up the phony loan scheme. He is awaiting 
trial in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. David C. Scheper, Vladovich and Smith 
were the central figures in a fraudulent scheme in which $4 million in loans 
from Westlake Thrift were channeled into a Riverside company called Leader 
Video. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of sources said Vladovich, who also owned a mortgage firm called 
Pioneer Acceptance Corp. of Riverside, allegedly began his fraudulent 
activities in 1984 with a banker named Henry Schneider, vice president of First 
United Thrift &amp; Loan of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Vladovich is accused of submitting false loan packages to Schneider for video 
store franchises that supposedly were going to be operated by some of his own 
employees and others. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, he sold some legitimate stores, then he coerced employees to submit 
paper work that they were buying the stores," one source told The Times. 
"Schneider helped him get 38 or 40 loans in all. Vladovich was the one actually 
making the payments and keeping the money." 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement between Vladovich and Schneider allegedly lasted about a year. 
Scheper said Vladovich received about $550,000 in loans and paid $15,000 in 
bribes to Schneider. Scheper said Schneider has agreed to plead guilty to three 
counts of conspiracy and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
First United ultimately was absorbed by a larger bank, however, and the loans 
to Vladovich were stopped in 1985. About that time, sources said, Schneider 
introduced Vladovich to Westlake Thrift officials. 
</P>
<P>
After meeting Smith, who then was a vice president of Westlake Thrift, 
Vladovich allegedly came up with a different scheme that involved obtaining 
$5,000 loan packages through Pioneer Acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
The loan packages were submitted to Westlake Thrift on behalf of people who 
supposedly were going to buy 48 video movies and video equipment with which to 
launch their own video store businesses -- a tiny inventory that alone would 
have warned off serious investors. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, according to federal officials, Vladovich initially enlisted 
applicants for the loans by telling them that he would give them $1,000 in 
video equipment for the use of their names and would make the actual 
$200-a-month loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange, officials said, Vladovich kept the $5,000 loans from Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
As one source described it: "What Vladovich told customers was: 'I'm trying to 
go public on the New York Stock Exchange. To do that, I need 100 stores. I'm a 
wealthy man. I've got enough money to do it myself, but it's tied up. If you 
fill out the loan application, you won't have any problems. I'll make the 
payments for you and give you $1,000 worth of video equipment.' " 
</P>
<P>
According to Scheper, Vladovich and his sales people processed more than 800 
loans worth about $4 million. He allegedly used some of the money to pay 
himself a $1,800-a-month salary and to cover his business operating expenses. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, the loan applicants were real people," one source said. 
"Some of the first people Vladovich contacted were California Highway Patrol 
officers in the San Bernardino area. He made a pitch to about 35 of them and 
got them signed up for the free video stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem was that the highway patrol people were asking too many 
questions," the source added. "They also were too demanding in terms of the 
kinds of free TVs and VCRs that they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
From the start, a variety of sources said, Vladovich put heavy pressure on his 
sales staff to write an increasing number of loan applications. The pressure 
allegedly increased when Vladovich needed additional funding for another 
business venture, a novelty company called Bric-a-Brac. 
</P>
<P>
"The salesmen had signed up members of their families by this point, and 
Vladovich was making the payments for them," one source said. "They started 
going to shopping malls and getting names from shoppers. It reached the point 
where they would make up Social Security numbers and submit the loans for 
fictitious people." 
</P>
<P>
Westlake Thrift, meanwhile, still was enjoying its boom period. Smith was in 
charge of the loan deals with Vladovich, and everything still looked good on 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not exactly clear when Smith knew these were bad loan packages," a source 
said. "By 1986, however, he knew that Vladovich was making the payments. In 
early 1987, he demanded a meeting, and Vladovich said he wasn't buying the 48 
movies that were supposed to be part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"Smith told him that if he missed a payment, the loans would be cut off. 
Vladovich said that if he did, they would go down together, and Westlake would 
lose more than $1 million in outstanding loans," a source added. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that confrontation, the indictment filed in U.S. District Court shows 
that the loan arrangement continued through the first half of 1987. Smith, 
however, began to distance himself from Vladovich, no longer personally signing 
the checks to Pioneer Acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
By this time, state banking regulators had begun to look at other questionable 
loan practices by Westlake Thrift. And, in July, 1987, a Westlake Thrift 
official named Chet Adams gained access to the Vladovich files and blew the 
whistle internally to other bank officers. 
</P>
<P>
Not only had the FBI investigation into criminal fraud begun, but the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. was beginning an inquiry of its own that eventually led 
to the forced closure of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's relationship with Vladovich effectively was ended. But the banker 
continued on a course that was destined to add to his problems. In late 1987, 
according to the indictment, he compounded his troubles by misappropriating 
$24,500 in bank funds, allegedly giving $5,000 to a female acquaintance in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
While Vladovich still faces trial, and Smith and the others indicted so far 
have not been sentenced, the guilty pleas by Smith and Vladovich's former sales 
force already have led some law enforcement agencies to view the investigation 
of Westlake Thrift as "a classic takedown" in a bank fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
"Bank failure cases, particularly those resulting from fraud, are enormously 
difficult to investigate and prosecute," said Gary Auer, special agent in 
charge of the FBI's Ventura office. 
</P>
<P>
"This case is a classic example of the kind of fraud that has taken place 
throughout the country," Auer said. "It shows that this is not just something 
that happens to people in other places, but can take place right here."

FRANK ZAPPA, CAPITALIST ROCKER; 
</P>
<P>
ENTREPRENEURSHIP: ZAPPA GOT TITLE TO HIS MASTER RECORDINGS BY SUING HIS RECORD 
COMPANY. NOW HE'S MAKING NON-MUSIC DEALS WITH THE SOVIETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Frank Zappa has long been known as a rock 'n' roll iconoclast, an outspoken, 
unconventional musician who earned the devotion of a moderate-sized following 
with records such as "Freak Out," "Weasels Ripped My Flesh" and "Sheik 
Yerbouti." But the former leader of the Mothers of Invention is also a shrewd 
businessman. "I don't have anything against making a profit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zappa, who turns 49 on Thursday, always did part his hair differently than his 
more commercially successful contemporaries. But this year, while middle-aged 
rockers such as the Who, Paul McCartney and the Rolling Stones were reaffirming 
their popularity on high-profile concert tours, Zappa was smart enough to stay 
home. He hung up his road gear after he lost $400,000 on his self-financed 1988 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody got paid but me," he said. Even though the four-month tour of the 
United States and Europe was 90% sold out, Zappa said the losses piled up 
because of high travel costs and salaries for the 12-piece band. There were 43 
people in all, three buses and five trucks. "I had to pay the cost of all the 
airplane tickets, all the buses, all the food, all the per diems and salaries," 
Zappa said. 
</P>
<P>
"That sort of dampens one's enthusiasm for going out there and doing it again," 
he said, adding that he's unwilling to accept financial backing from a 
corporate sponsor because it would mean hawking products such as beer or soft 
drinks. 
</P>
<P>
But Zappa is hardly struggling. Like any other businessman, he's worked at 
cutting his overhead and he looks for new business opportunities where he can 
find them, some as distant as the Soviet Union. From offices in North Hollywood 
and his hilltop Laurel Canyon home, Zappa and his wife of 22 years, Gail, run 
several businesses: a record label, a mail-order company, a video company and a 
music publishing firm. All the businesses are 100%-owned by Zappa and his wife 
and he says they are profitable, although he remains tight-lipped about sales 
and earnings. 
</P>
<P>
He owns the lucrative master tapes for many of his recordings, thanks to a 
lawsuit he filed against his former record company, Warner Bros. Records, and 
he slowly re-releases the old titles on compact discs. Much like an annuity, 
the money keeps coming from those re-releases. "My stuff sells year after year 
and the income from those sales goes to me," Zappa said. 
</P>
<P>
It was a few years ago that Zappa and his wife decided to cut their overhead. 
They had employed managers, lawyers and accountants to run his music 
businesses. "After we started reading the contracts, we started to get smart 
and figured out maybe we could do it better," Gail Zappa said. "So I fired 
everyone and started over." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1985 she has run the business end of things. "He's the artist and puts 
the product together. I handle all production aspects of it, the cover art and 
packaging. I make all the financial decisions." 
</P>
<P>
And lately, the man who produced "Valley Girl," (the 1982 hit he made with his 
daughter, Moon, who immortalized a series of Val-slang phrases such as "Gag me 
with a spoon") has turned his sights to international trade and is brokering 
joint ventures in the Soviet Union, including a proposed deal to start a 
U.S.-Soviet business-oriented television show. 
</P>
<P>
In the fickle world of pop music, Frank Zappa never achieved superstar status, 
though he did have a few certifiable hits. According to Billboard magazine, 
Zappa's three biggest singles were "Don't Eat the Yellow Snow," which reached 
No. 4 on the charts in 1974, "Dancin' Fool," which hit No. 8 in 1979, and, with 
Moon, "Valley Girl," No. 12 in 1982. But the recordings were labeled by 
Billboard as novelty songs, meaning "it's like the Singing Chipmunks, more or 
less tongue in cheek," said Kim Whitburn, a spokeswoman for Billboard's record 
research unit. 
</P>
<P>
Zappa, however, concentrates on other numbers. He says artists can make lots 
more money by running their own record companies than by collecting royalties 
from someone else. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Zappa sued Warner Bros. Records, alleging that Warner used 
questionable accounting methods to mislead him about royalties due from sales 
of his music, a practice he says is still common in the music business. Most 
artists don't take the time to closely scrutinize their contracts with record 
companies, Zappa said. But he wanted more control over the sales of his 
records. 
</P>
<P>
When the suit was settled out of court, ownership of many of the masters 
reverted to him. Zappa said he spent about $1.6 million on the suit, but the 
steady sales of his old records are very lucrative. "I have albums that were 
released 10, 15, 20, 25 years ago that are selling substantial quantities in CD 
and cassette," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros. executives declined to give figures on past sales of Zappa's 
albums, and they remain touchy about the lawsuit. "I'm not going to deal with 
any issue relating to Frank Zappa," said a source at the company, who asked 
that his name not be used. "If we say he sold 2 million records for us, he 
might come back and sue us for royalties." But the source did say Zappa's 
records consistently sold hundreds of thousands of units, which "wasn't huge, 
but it was substantial." 
</P>
<P>
Zappa releases his new albums on his independent label, Barking Pumpkin 
Records, which he started in 1981. "We're taking all the risk a record company 
takes," he said. "We have to pay for our own recording, advertising, every 
other cost a record company would normally have. On the other hand, all the 
profit a record company would normally have is ours now." The records are 
distributed through a unit of Capitol Records. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the record company, Zappa also has a licensing deal with a 
Boston company, Rykodisc, which has distributed about two dozen of Zappa's old 
albums on CD during the past three years. Don Rose, president of Rykodisc, said 
that sales of a few of them have topped 100,000 units, a strong showing 
considering the recordings are up to 25 years old and that an album goes "gold" 
with sales of 500,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
Though most of Zappa's income comes from the record business, a growing 
offshoot is his Barfko-Swill mail order company, which sells Zappa T-shirts, 
posters and postcards, as well as records and cassettes. He also runs a music 
publishing business, Munchkin Music; Honker Home Video, a company named after 
Zappa's nose and which has produced videos such as "The True Story of '200 
Motels,' " based on Zappa's film "200 Motels;" and Joe's Garage, a rehearsal 
hall rental company. 
</P>
<P>
And after four trips to the Soviet Union in recent few years, Zappa has a 
variety of non-music deals he's trying to put together. He's already set up an 
agreement for a Chatsworth company to receive amber for jewelry-making from the 
Soviets, for which he received a 10% commission. 
</P>
<P>
He is also working on starting a satellite-linked television show that would 
feature Soviet and American business and legal experts exchanging ideas and 
information. He says the cable channel Financial News Network is interested in 
the concept, and he has another working trip to the Soviet Union planned for 
January. Other joint U.S.-Soviet deals in the works include the possible 
manufacture of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Zappa home, where Frank and Gail live with three of their four children and 
where much of their business is run, is large but unpretentious. Wood-paneled 
rooms are dark and cluttered, and stacks of tapes line the walls. In one part 
of the house is Zappa's studio, where he started installing digital recording 
equipment in the early '80s, before the technology became a standard for 
recording. 
</P>
<P>
The studio also contains Zappa's beloved Synclavier, a computerized synthesizer 
that can be programmed to produce a vast array of sounds. 
</P>
<P>
Zappa was born in Baltimore, but his family moved around a lot because his 
father was a civil servant for the military. The Zappas eventually settled in 
Lancaster, near Edwards Air Force Base. When he was about 12, Zappa became 
interested in drums because he liked "the sounds of things a person could beat 
on." 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager, while other kids were spending their money on cars, Zappa was 
buying records by Igor Stravinsky and avant-garde musicians such as Edgard 
Varese. He formed his first band while still in high school. Zappa's first 
album was "Freak Out," which he recorded with the Mothers of Invention in 1965. 
Since then he has produced more than 50 albums, both with and without the 
Mothers. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago Zappa went on a tour of another kind when he accepted some 
dates on the college lecture circuit. Zappa said the $15,000 per lecture he 
earned was practically all gravy -- which rattled him a little since he prefers 
touring with a band but can't justify the expense. The businessman explained: 
"The interesting thing about lecturing is I make more money sitting in a chair 
on a stage for 90 minutes than I do playing in a rock band because there's no 
overhead."

JONES IS BACK ON THE AIR AND BACK IN CONTROL OF HIS LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
RADIO: AFTER LOSING THE 91X MORNING SLOT TWICE BECAUSE OF DRUGS, THE DEEJAY IS 
WORKING HARD TO PROVE HIMSELF AT THE SLOWER-PACED Z90.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bryan Jones says his party-animal days are ancient history. 
</P>
<P>
The man who almost single-handedly caused the implementation of a drug testing 
policy at XTRA-FM (91X), losing the prestigious morning slot twice because of 
drug problems, was hired last April as the morning personality for XHTZ-FM 
(Z90). 
</P>
<P>
He'd much rather talk about Z90, as he lounges on the oceanfront deck of a 
trendy Mission Beach restaurant, dressed in his omnipresent shorts and T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave me a job when I was down," he said. "I'm happy to be here." 
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledges that the fact that he's on the air in San Diego, driving to 
Tijuana at 5 a.m. every weekday morning to handle Z90's morning drive show, is 
particularly interesting in relation to where he's been and the jobs he lost at 
91X. 
</P>
<P>
He says he is free of drugs, and his track record since joining Z90 in April 
suggests it's true. 
</P>
<P>
For Jones, there were no dramatic events or shocking revelations. Nothing like 
a "Just Say No" campaign changed his mind about drugs. 
</P>
<P>
He simply decided he was tired of it. He didn't enjoy doing cocaine anymore. He 
wanted to try to get his life together. 
</P>
<P>
And he wanted to do it in San Diego, the one place where he was known, as he 
says, as a "deadbeat." 
</P>
<P>
"I have something to prove here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
More than another clean-and-sober saga, this is the story of a radio station 
taking a chance, and a young man trying to make the most of it. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 32, was raised in Fresno, and 91X was his first job outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Compared to Fresno, San Diego is Gotham City," Jones said, laughing at the 
"Batman" image. 
</P>
<P>
XTRA hired Jones and partner Dean Opperman to be the morning team for its new 
"cutting edge" rock 
</P>
<P>
'n' roll format in 1984. The station heavily promoted the "Dean and Jones and 
the Breakfast Club" team, noted for its wacky skits and bizarre characters. A 
typical morning would include parodies of television shows, such as "Nitwit's 
Court" and "Genital Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
They were extremely popular with the station's youth-oriented audience. Those 
were good days for the duo. There were parties aplenty for the old friends, who 
felt like they had hit the big time. 
</P>
<P>
Opperman was the first casualty. After a series of absences and drug-related 
problems, he left the 
</P>
<P>
station in October, 1985, to return to Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Soon Jones found it increasingly difficult to make the 5:30 a.m. drive to 
Tijuana, then the site of 91X's studio. The unexcused absences and unexplained 
behavior continued. Party animals in the radio industry are not unusual. They 
only attract attention when they don't show up for work. Seemingly everybody in 
the local radio industry knew Jones was using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1986, Jones resigned, before he was fired. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted me to go test, and I would have tested positive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to Fresno and a classic rock station. But in 1988, new 91X program 
director Trip Reeb, now with KROQ in Los Angeles, called and said he wanted him 
back at the station -- under certain conditions. He had to be clean of drugs, 
and he had to submit to urinalysis three times a week to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to testing him, XTRA paid for Jones to regularly visit a 
psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
At the station, however, he returned to the same scene, the same pressures that 
he says led him to drugs in his earlier stint with 91X. If anything, the 
pressure was worse. Not everyone at the station was thrilled to have him back, 
and he sensed the animosity, even understood it. 
</P>
<P>
"The station was paying more for my rehab than some people were making," Jones 
said. He laughed at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody told them I was going to do drugs," he said. "Even the psychiatrist 
told my bosses I was going to drugs." 
</P>
<P>
But 91X management stuck by him. The arrangement worked for eight months. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no problem stopping," he said. "But I still wanted to do drugs." 
</P>
<P>
He had tested positive for drugs in June, 1988, a few months after he was 
hired, but no action was taken against him. But a few months later, in 
September, Jones went to London for a special broadcast from the Amnesty 
International benefit concert. In the swirl of backstage activity, he did 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, back in San Diego, he flunked a urinalysis and was fired. 
</P>
<P>
At first, he showed no remorse. When The Times broke the story of his dismissal 
for flunking the drug test, he denied using drugs, and threatened a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not an idiot," Jones told a reporter last year after he was fired. "It 
would be pretty dumb to do drugs if you're tested three times a week." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Jones admits, he was dumb. Really dumb. 
</P>
<P>
He did use cocaine, he says, and he deserved to be fired. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to Fresno, where he says he "played golf and got stoned" almost 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I had more fun doing drugs than working at 91X," because of the 
pressures at the station, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He took a job as a morning disc jockey with the classic rock station in Fresno 
and settled into his old party habits. 
</P>
<P>
The realization that he was on a track to nowhere came when he took a hard look 
at his life style. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got pissed off at it," he said. "The people I was hanging around with 
were deadbeats. I realized that, if I'm hanging out with these people, then 
that must mean I'm a deadbeat too." 
</P>
<P>
For him, doing drugs became a "real lame way of looking at life." The lure of a 
great job wasn't enough to make him quit; he says he finally just decided 
chemicals were stupid. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is going to make you stop unless you want to stop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With something to prove, he came to San Diego looking for work. There are few 
opportunities in rock radio in San Diego. Z90 might have significantly lower 
ratings than 91X, but it's rock 'n' roll. He "camped out" at Z90 until they 
finally hired him. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody deserves another opportunity," station owner Victor Diaz said in a 
recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
There are no drug testing provisions in his contract with Z90, which pays him 
"about one-third" of the $70,000 he earned annually at 91X, according to Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"I think (testing) is an invasion of privacy," Diaz said. "If somebody is doing 
what they're supposed to do, it's nobody's business." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone at Z90 appears pleased with Jones. The almost nonexistent ratings for 
the morning show have been steadily creeping up, and, despite the laborious 
drive to Tijuana every morning, Jones has been the model of consistency. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen him work harder than here," said program director Gary Beck, 
who worked with Jones at XTRA. "I've never seen a person care as much that had 
a couple of strikes against him." 
</P>
<P>
For Jones, Z90 is more than a new beginning. It's also fun. On the air, he 
feels less pressure to be constantly funny than in his days at 91X, although he 
still displays much of the Letterman-like irreverence of those days. A recent 
routine included a reference to a celebrity cookbook by Vice President Dan 
Quayle titled "Sand is Good Food." 
</P>
<P>
"I talk a lot less, just because we're a music station," Jones said. "These 
people are not saying, 'Do 15 bits a day.' They're saying, 'Play some music and 
do some jokes.' 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody and his brother is having some sort of yuck fest (on the air). I've 
gotta believe people are tired of it." 
</P>
<P>
Far from any bitterness, he has nothing but raves for his former employers at 
91X. The firings were his fault, he says, not theirs. 
</P>
<P>
But his focus is on Z90, and making the most of his opportunity. His goal is to 
get a job in a major market, which can offer him dramatically more money and 
exposure, but he's in no rush. A new girlfriend and the consistency of the Z90 
job have helped change his outlook on the radio business. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for me to rebuild," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Given his history, a big market job offer probably won't be forthcoming for a 
while. He realizes that, to a degree, he's paying his dues, that he is trying 
to wipe away the impression some people have of him as an irresponsible party 
dude. 
</P>
<P>
"I sure was a deadbeat, but I'm not now," Jones said. "Now I just have to prove 
it."

JACK BRUCE, ONCE CREAM OF THE CROP, RETURNS TO ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"When it came to getting along together, they might have called us Sour Cream," 
quipped bassist Jack Bruce, referring to his stormy 2 1/2 years with drummer 
Ginger Baker and guitarist Eric Clapton in the late-'60s rock super-group 
Cream. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in an elegant Beverly Hills office, Bruce, a small man wearing rumpled 
clothes and flashing a beaming smile that never seemed to quit, continued: "We 
did a lot of things wrong when it came to getting along. In many ways, it was 
like a bad marriage. We were young and foolish. But there were high points. We 
did make some good music." 
</P>
<P>
He was just being modest. Cream made some great music. 
</P>
<P>
Fans still recall Bruce, 46, from his glory days. That's 
</P>
<P>
why there's such interest in his new band, which plays tonight at San Diego's 
Bacchanal as part of a tour promoting Bruce's Epic album, "A Question of Time" 
-- his first American solo album and tour since 1981. The band also includes 
Baker, who has been both Bruce's friend and nemesis over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've patched up our differences," said Bruce. "We can play together now. But 
we used to have some terrible times. Lord knows Ginger can be difficult. But 
can you believe that I can be difficult too?" 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it's hard to imagine this hearty, outgoing Scotsman being 
temperamental. But he reiterated: "I have my bad moments if people push the 
wrong buttons. Ginger and Eric used to push the wrong buttons sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Cream, with its blues-influenced rock and its winding, improvisational jams, 
was the band that created a cult of musicianship in rock. The trio was revered, 
but their meteoric career lasted only from 1966-68. Why did Cream turn sour? 
</P>
<P>
"Personality conflicts, hassles with fame, drug abuse -- we all had drug 
problems," Bruce replied. "A combination of many things. Cream was sort of an 
accident anyway. No one thought we'd get that big. We got over two good years 
out of it. That was enough." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce has been involved with various jazz, rock and fusion bands over the 
years, and has recorded assorted solo albums in Europe and the United States. 
Though none of these projects has made a huge commercial impact, he has always 
been a respected musician. But thanks to songwriting royalties -- he was 
Cream's main composer and has a catalogue of 150 songs -- he is financially 
secure. 
</P>
<P>
So why, in his late 40s, has he re-entered the rock 'n' roll grind?

"It's not the money," replied Bruce. "I just want to reach as many people as 
possible with my music. There's an excitement that comes from having a large 
audience that I've missed. I want to recapture that feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Though noted for his skill with blues and rock, Bruce considers himself a jazz 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"When I left home at 17, I was working on this U.S. Air Force base in Italy," 
recalled Bruce, who was raised in a working-class family in Scotland. "That's 
where I got turned on to (jazz bassist Charlie) Mingus. I really wanted to get 
deeper and deeper into jazz." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce turned to jazz bass after briefly studying cello at a Scottish music 
academy. "Ginger and I started out as a rhythm section, playing free jazz 
influenced by people like Ornette Coleman. I was really into modern jazz. I was 
a snob." 
</P>
<P>
But Bruce also liked the blues. He played in three blues-based bands, headed by 
Alexis Korner, Graham Bond and John Mayall, before the formation of Cream. 
Clapton, who had also worked with Mayall, lured Bruce and Baker into the 
blues-oriented style that was the essence of Cream. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce is still ambivalent about Clapton: "We get along and we don't. If he 
walked in now I'd shake his hand and be friendly. But he's done stuff to rub me 
the wrong way. It's sort of love-hate." 
</P>
<P>
One thing that slightly miffs Bruce is that many fans think Clapton -- who is 
still a major star -- was the main singer and songwriter in Cream. "Eric helps 
perpetuate that myth in his own subtle way," Bruce said. "It's a minor thing, 
but it's still somewhat aggravating." 
</P>
<P>
The last time he saw Clapton, Bruce said, was when Clapton sat in with Bruce's 
band last year at the Bottom Line in New York. "I didn't get to talk to him 
much then," Bruce said. "We haven't really talked in years. But we'll get 
together again one day." 
</P>
<P>
That reunion might happen, Bruce said, on this tour if he and Clapton are in 
the same town. "The three of us would jam together," Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
Although his band is called the Jack Bruce Band With Ginger Baker, Bruce said a 
reunion would be different. "It would be like old times. We could call it Sweet 
Cream -- old but still sweet." 
</P>

<P>
Photo, ALMOST WHOLE CREAM "We did a lot of things wrong when it came to getting 
along," Jack Bruce, above, says of his days in the rock super-group Cream with 
Ginger Baker and Eric Clapton. But now Baker is in Bruce's new band, and, if 
Clapton is around during this tour, he's welcome to join them for a song or two 
-- probably. "We get along and we don't," Bruce explains. "He's done stuff to 
rub me the wrong way. It's sort of love-hate."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : CLASSICAL MUSIC;

WHEN IT COMES TO OPERAS, 'PHANTOM' HAS BIT OF ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"There's really no need to send up opera," mused Barry Koron, "because the man 
in the street thinks it's pretty funny just as it is." 
</P>
<P>
Koron, who is musical director for Ken Hill's "Phantom of the Opera," wryly 
summed up the author's point of view in this pastiche of opera excerpts wedded 
to the Gaston Leroux story. Hill's "Phantom" -- known in some circles as the 
"other Phantom" to distinguish it from the megabuck Andrew Lloyd Webber musical 
-- opens a two-week run tonight at Symphony Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Koron has been with Hill's "Phantom " since it opened at San Francisco's 
Theater-on-the-Square in August, 1988, although this scaled-down traveling 
version commenced in Washington's Warner Theater in September. (The tour is 
booked through May, 1991, after which the producers are eyeing Japan and 
Australia.) 
</P>
<P>
Koron directs his six-man pit orchestra from his stack of synthesizer 
keyboards, much like a conductor from the Baroque era conducted his opera 
orchestra from the harpsichord. He spoke by phone from Las Vegas, the 
production's stop before San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"This 'Phantom' uses opera for musical comedy purposes," Koron explained. "Hill 
went through the whole opera repertory and picked out what he deemed the 
angriest aria, the sweetest, the scariest, etc." 
</P>
<P>
Some detractors of the Hill "Phantom" point out that it appears to draw much of 
its box office appeal from audience confusion with Lloyd Webber's latest 
musical showpiece. Though the show's producers have admitted that their show 
would not be as successful without Lloyd Webber's "Phantom of the Opera," they 
also point out that Lloyd Webber derived his inspiration to write "Phantom of 
the Opera" after seeing Ken Hill's original London production. 
</P>
<P>
Koron explained that the greatest number of opera excerpts in Hill's "Phantom" 
is drawn from Gounod's "Faust" because a performance of "Faust" takes place in 
the story. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, the phantom's plight contains a thematic echo of Gounod's opera, 
where an individual with extraordinary knowledge gains temporary control over 
someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Other selections are from more operas with demonic overtones, from Mozart's 
"Don Giovanni" and Offenbach's "Tale of Hoffmann." In one case, Hill pasted 
together a portion of the scary "Wolf's Glen" scene from Von Weber's "Die 
Freischutz" with the sorceress Ulrike's aria in Verdi's "Un Ballo in Maschera." 
</P>
<P>
And a final note of irony: When Hill's "Phantom of the Opera" is playing at 
Symphony Hall, up the street at Civic Theatre, "Starlight Express" -- another 
Lloyd Webber smash hit -- will be playing a a five-night run from Dec. 27-31. 
</P>
<P>
Up-to-date in Sacramento. Karen Keltner, San Diego Opera's resident associate 
conductor, made a well-received Sacramento Opera debut last month conducting 
Donizetti's "L'Elisir d'Amore." (Keltner conducted Donizetti's other popular 
opera buffa, "Don Pasquale," in March, 1989, for San Diego Opera.) Although 
local audiences are accustomed to seeing Keltner in the orchestra pit at Civic 
Theatre -- she has conducted the gamut of grand opera from "The Barber of 
Seville" to "Faust" -- as a woman conductor, she was a novelty in Sacramento. 
Just before the opera's opening, the Sacramento Bee ran a lengthy feature on 
Keltner, in which staff writer Robert Masulio noted that Keltner would be "the 
first woman ever to conduct a Sacramento Opera production."

Minnesota pilgrimage. Believe it or not, there are worthy Minnesota traditions 
that predate Garrison Keillor's mythical Lake Wobegon. KPBS-TV (Channel 15) 
will broadcast the 77th annual St. Olaf College Christmas festival concert Dec. 
23 at 8 p.m. Every December, the Minnesota college that pioneered the a 
cappella choral tradition in North America masses all of its choral and 
orchestral forces to showcase the best sacred music of the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
More Holiday Sounds. KPBS-FM, the local public radio station, will broadcast a 
generous sampling of seasonal music this weekend. Among the more unusual are 
two non-Christmas celebrations, the Western Wind Ensemble's "Celebration of 
Light" (Dec. 23, 11 a.m.), which observes the winter solstice with Renaissance, 
Hanukkah and Native American music, and an all-Hanukkah concert featuring 
traditional Eastern European Jewish music performed by the Kleveland Klezmorim 
(Dec. 23, 9 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
For the traditionalists, the Dale Warland Singers celebrate Christmas with both 
familiar and rarely heard carols (Dec. 24, 1 p.m.), and tenor Jose Carreras 
leads the forces singing Christmas music from Latin America (Dec. 24, 3 p.m.). 
Holland's leading Baroque specialist, Ton Koopman, will lead the Amsterdam 
Baroque Orchestra in a concert of 18th-Century European choral and instrumental 
Christmas music (Dec. 24, 4 p.m.)

Pauley's Exit at 'Today': Jane Pauley's last day as co-host on "Today" will be 
Friday, Dec. 29. The early-morning show is planning an on-air tribute to 
Pauley, but details still need to be worked out. Deborah Norville takes over in 
the job Jan. 8, and, for the interim week, NBC is bringing on several former 
"Today" hosts to share the couch with Bryant Gumbel. Tom Brokaw, who was host 
of "Today" when Pauley joined the show in 1976, will join Hugh Downs and 
sportscaster Joe Garagiola as fill-in co-hosts. Shauna Snow

The former president of the Indianapolis League of Women Voters and her two 
sons were led to federal court in chains today to answer charges that they ran 
one of the largest marijuana-smuggling rings ever uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 24 hours after their extradition from Austria, Linda Leary and 
Richard and Paul Heilbrunn appeared before U.S. Magistrate John P. Godich. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving the United States in 1985, Leary, 58, had been president of the 
Indianapolis League of Women Voters and the local chapter of the National 
Council of Jewish Women. Paul Heilbrunn, 35, was a commodities broker and 
columnist for a local business journal. His 38-year-old brother lived with his 
wife and two children on a farm outside Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Leary and her sons were among 34 people named in a 1987 indictment outlining 
the marijuana-smuggling ring that allegedly involved 11 states and moved at 
least 250,000 pounds of the drug.

<P>
Robert E. Page, former publisher of the Chicago Sun-Times, has agreed to 
purchase the Orange Coast Daily Pilot and four local weekly newspapers from 
Adams Communications Corp. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Page said the Pilot offices in Costa Mesa would serve as headquarters for a 
"Southern California publishing company," and that "other transactions are 
pending." He would not discuss what other papers he may be purchasing, but he 
reportedly is interested in a group of weekly newspapers in Northern San Diego 
County that are for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The Pilot, purchased by Adams Communications from Ingersoll Publications last 
year, has a circulation of about 23,000 centered in the Costa Mesa-Newport 
Beach area. The weekly newspapers -- all called the Independent -- serve 
Newport Beach, Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Pilot Publisher Rosemary Churchman has resigned, but Page said other staff 
changes were not anticipated at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Page said his deal with Adams was expected to close "within 72 hours."

The sponsor of the Proposition 103 insurance initiative today said it would try 
to put a measure on the November, 1990, ballot that would create a state 
insurance agency to replace private auto insurers. 
</P>
<P>
Voter Revolt's proposed California Auto Plan would kick in if industry 
insurance averages show by Sept. 1, 1991, that rates have not been reduced to 
20% below 1987 levels and if more than 15% of motorists are uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
"Our message to the insurance companies is, 'Obey Prop. 103 or we're going to 
kick your butts out of the state of California,' " Voter Revolt chief Harvey 
Rosenfield said at a morning news conference.

FBI agents intent on arresting suspected Soviet spy Felix Bloch attempted to 
turn his family against him, his daughter says. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted my mother as the star witness. They were grasping at straws; they 
were desperate," Andrea Bloch, 26, said in today's New York Post. The agents 
threatened to charge her mother, Lucille Bloch, as a co-conspirator, Andrea 
Bloch charged. 
</P>
<P>
"They were trying to pressure my father into breaking by using us," she said. 
"They wanted to make us so miserable that it would make him miserable."

<P>
The FBI's plan "totally backfired," she said, despite the strains it put on the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Bloch, once the No. 2 man in the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, was followed by FBI 
agents for months after he was videotaped purportedly passing a briefcase to a 
Soviet official in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
The surveillance has been scaled back recently, and Bloch has not been charged 
with any crime.

Prime Minister Herbert Blaize, who won election after the U.S. invasion in 
1983, died early today at his official residence, Governor General Paul Scoon 
announced. He was 71.

<P>
Blaize had been suffering for years from cancer of the prostate and had made 
regular, annual visits to Walter Reed General Hospital in Washington for 
radiation treatment. 
</P>
<P>
He died at his official residence just after 9 a.m., Scoon said. He had been 
working from an office in his residence for about a year because of his 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
Following the Reagan Administration-backed military intervention in 1983, 
Blaize and two other leaders of moderate political parties formed the coalition 
New National party and won elections in 1984. The United States intervened in 
Grenada after the government of Marxist Prime Minister Maurice Bishop was 
overthrown by a military coup.

FORMER ENVOY TO CHINA BLASTS BUSH INITIATIVE

Winston Lord, a career diplomat who served as President Ronald Reagan's 
ambassador to China, today denounced President Bush's decision to send 
emissaries to Beijing as a "severely misguided" step that will make the United 
States appear weak to China's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"One does not shore up the long-term foundations for Sino-American relations by 
appearing weak to China's leaders and callous to the Chinese and American 
people," Lord said in a signed column in today's Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
"One does not earn respect abroad by reversing field within months and 
practicing double standards," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lord's piece was written before the White House's disclosure Monday that Brent 
Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, and Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the 
deputy secretary of state, secretly visited Beijing on Bush's orders in July. 
</P>
<P>
Scowcroft and Eagleburger also visited China earlier this month. The White 
House announced that visit after they arrived in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Lord said in seeking improved ties with China the Administration forfeited the 
right to censure it on moral grounds. "But even on its own terms the Scowcroft 
mission was severely misguided," he said, arguing it undermined China's "closet 
moderates." 
</P>
<P>
"Far from strengthening their hand, the Administration has robbed them of the 
argument that Chinese repression and xenophobia entail costs," he wrote. 
"Japan, Europe and others will feel free to follow the Scowcroft trail." 
</P>
<P>
The former ambassador said that while censure might not influence China's 
hard-line leaders, "international acquiescence" in the Tian An Men Square 
shootings "surely reinforces their view that crushing their populace elicits 
only fleeting outcries, no lasting repercussions."

An obstetrician convicted of infanticide after witnesses said he let an aborted 
fetus die was placed on three years' probation today and ordered to perform 300 
hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Joseph Melnick, 66, was found guilty in a nonjury trial in June, the first 
criminal prosecution under Pennsylvania's 1974 abortion law that requires 
doctors to do what they can if they remove a living fetus. 
</P>
<P>
Common Pleas Judge Lynn Abraham heeded Melnick's plea for leniency, calling 
what he did a "criminal mistake" for which neither jail nor a heavy fine was 
appropriate. She also said she had no intention of making an example of him. 
</P>
<P>
The mistake, the judge said, was that the doctor performed an abortion on a 
teen-ager in her eighth month of pregnancy. The doctor said he had been told 
she was in her fourth or fifth month.

The real average weekly earnings of American workers, after adjusting for 
inflation and seasonal factors, fell 0.7% in November, the Labor Department 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
It said October real average earnings were unchanged after earlier figures, 
which had shown a 0.6% gain, were revised. 
</P>
<P>
November real average earnings were down 1.5% from the same month a year ago, 
the department said. 
</P>

The November decline reflected a 0.1% fall in average hourly earnings, a 0.3% 
drop in average weekly hours and a 0.3% rise in the consumer price index for 
urban wage earners and clerical workers, the department said.

Consumer prices rose 0.4% in November after a 0.5% October gain, with higher 
food and housing costs accounting for much of last month's advance.

West German automotive giant Volkswagen AG said today it expects record profits 
of about $580 million this year despite market share losses in North America. 
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen's executive board said preliminary figures revealed a 10% increase, 
bringing the concern's total turnover to $38 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen, the largest European automotive concern and fourth-ranking 
internationally, expects an increase over 1988 profits of $450 million for the 
entire concern, including $304 million for Volkswagen AG in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, almost 3 million VW, Audi and other automobiles under Volkswagen 
management were delivered worldwide, an increase of 3%. In Europe, 2.14 million 
cars were sold, accounting for a 5% increase. 
</P>
<P>
But Volkswagen registered a 20% loss in the United States and a 15% loss in 
Canada.

Dresdner Bank, West Germany's second-largest commercial bank, announced plans 
today to open an office in Dresden, the East German city where the bank was 
founded more than a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to success of economic restructuring in East Germany (lies) in a 
transfer of capital, technology and management know-how from Western industrial 
nations," it said. 
</P>
<P>
The bank was founded in Dresden in 1872. Although its management was shifted to 
Berlin in 1884, Dresden remained the bank's legal headquarters until 1950. The 
official headquarters has been in Frankfurt since 1957.

A 'TERRIFYING' TIME FOR THE STONES; 
</P>
<P>
CABLE TV: ROCK 'N' ROLL'S BAD BOYS GO LIVE ON PAY TV TONIGHT AT ATLANTIC CITY. 
THEY MAY BE GOOD BUT CAN THEY DRAW AN AUDIENCE LIKE WRESTLING? 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tonight's Rolling Stones concert on pay-per-view television is being dubbed 
"Terrifying," and that may well be the mood now that the Stones' "Steel Wheels" 
tour of North America is drawing to a close. 
</P>
<P>
It's not terror at the thought of doing a live concert on television, of 
course, but that Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and the boys are finally going to 
have to count all the money they've earned over the last 3 1/2 months, a take 
estimated to be well over $100 million from ticket sales, sponsorships and 
merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
The concert, featuring one of the biggest names ever in rock, also will serve 
as another test of the viability of live concerts on pay-per-view television. 
Attractions such as boxing have generally done much better. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one's giving out exact figures, the Stones figure to make a bundle 
for tonight's work at the Convention Center in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
The three-hour concert will be available locally for $19.95 to $24.95 per 
household (depending on cable company), with a taped repeat for sale on 
Saturday. With a national pay-per-view subscriber base of 13 million homes and 
with projections that 2% of that potential audience will buy the show, that 
could mean a gross of $5.7 million, more than any of their sold-out stadium 
shows. All in all, a good night's pay for a good night's work. 
</P>
<P>
Such scale is typical of the Rolling Stones' 25-year career, and the only 
questions some fans may have at this point are how the astounding "Steel 
Wheels" urban-decay set -- 340 feet wide and 90 feet high -- is going to fit 
into the Convention Center, and whether Mick Jagger is going to bump his head 
on the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
"And if Mick bumps his head (when he strides atop the set on 'Sympathy for the 
Devil'), we'll keep it," said Lorne Michaels of "Saturday Night Live," who is 
acting as executive producer for "Terrifying." 
</P>
<P>
Although the show will be similar to those on the "Steel Wheels" tour, there 
will be some special guests, including Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin of Guns N' 
Roses, guitarist Eric Clapton, bluesman John Lee Hooker and one or two 
"surprises." 
</P>
<P>
Pay-per-view concerts are still in the early stage. By comparison, pay-per-view 
wrestling and boxing do three or four times better, "$20-million days without 
blinking," according to Scott Kurnit, president of Showtime Event Television, 
Showtime's pay-per-view division. "For music, it can't just be music. It has to 
be an event, something that is compelling television. Music by itself is not as 
compelling as a boxing match."

A manufacturing mistake has struck a sour note with the Dallas Symphony 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The producer of compact discs for the Pro Arts record company mislabeled up to 
1,000 compact discs, according to the orchestra's music administrator, Victor 
Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
"I found out about it when members of the orchestra bought the recording of 
Gustav Holst's 'The Planets' to see how they sounded and discovered that they 
had bought a Christian rock group album," Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the discs have been recalled, but Marshall said he still has 50 of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even know who the rock group is, but I don't really want to throw the 
discs away," Marshall said. "I may string them on a wire and turn them into a 
mobile for my office."

<P>
The battle of the show-biz barons in Clear Lake over Buddy Holly's legacy 
appears to be over. 
</P>
<P>
The winner is Surf Ballroom owner Darrel Hein, who plans to hold "The Winter 
Dance Party" on Feb. 2-3 in honor of Holly, the rock legend who played his last 
concert in the ballroom in 1959. Hein apparently won a feud with another 
promoter, Darryl Hensley, a Burlington radio station owner, who was going to 
stage a rival event at a cattle barn. 
</P>
<P>
Clear Lake has held a highly popular Buddy Holly memorial concert the last 11 
years in the Surf on the anniversary of his death, but the two promoters had a 
falling out, prompting the two different plans. 
</P>
<P>
The lure of the Surf Ballroom was apparently the bigger draw. Hensley said he 
was not selling any tickets to his family-sanctioned Holly event at the Cerro 
Gordo County fairgrounds, so he had to cancel. 
</P>
<P>
Hein cannot use the Holly name but says Holly fans will come to see the Surf. 
He may negotiate with Holly's family in the future for the right to attach the 
rock star's name to the annual concert. 
</P>
<P>
Holly, a native of Lubbock, Tex., was killed along with Ritchie Valens, J. P. 
(The Big Bopper) Richardson and pilot Roger Peterson when their light plane 
crashed in a farm field outside Clear Lake on Feb. 3, 1959, while flying to 
Minnesota for another concert. The event was immortalized in song as the "Day 
the Music Died."

PRODUCER SUES GARCIA MARQUEZ

Nobel Prize-winning novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez faces a breach-of-agreement 
lawsuit filed by a movie producer who contends that the author broke a deal 
with him to film "Love in the Time of Cholera." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Roth, producer of the film "Julia," claims in the suit filed Monday 
that he had a deal with Garcia Marquez to pay $400,000 for film rights to the 
Colombian-born author's latest international bestseller. But the deal went sour 
when Garcia Marquez allegedly demanded Roth hire a Latin American director to 
produce the film set in South America, said Roth's attorney, Max Blecher. 
Roth's financing arrangements fell through after Garcia Marquez imposed the 
condition, Blecher said.

Q. My wife makes fun of my sexual needs. We have been married 43 years, and I 
still love to pleasure her but I am not up for intercourse -- no erections. 
When I approach her, she says things like, "Hey, King Kong, lust rising in you 
like a volcano again?" 
</P>
<P>
Lately she has been doing comic striptease acts -- "to arouse me," she says. 
She is really making fun of our bodies and of golden-years lovemaking. She 
refuses to be tender or serious or romantic. It is a total turnoff. What can I 
do? 
</P>
<P>
A. You have to tell her that it makes you sad that she wants to cause you this 
kind of pain. Tell her you are going to seek marital counseling, by yourself if 
she won't come with you, because what she is doing is seriously troubling to 
you. 
</P>
<P>
And do go for that help. The marriage counselor may suggest a way for you to 
reason with her. Or she may see that she is harming her marriage and you, and 
agree to go to counseling with you. I think she is resentful or angry with you, 
and you had better find out what it is that makes her act that way. If she 
weren't resentful, why be so mean to a lifelong companion? 
</P>
<P>
Q. Ten months ago I walked in on my boyfriend having an affair with himself and 
wearing women's lingerie. I had known him for more than a year and never 
suspected. He has been doing this since he was 6. And he has tried to make me 
think he feels very guilty about it, but I don't think he even wants to stop 
it. I think he is addicted to the feeling it gives him. 
</P>
<P>
I have tried to understand and even went to the length of researching the 
problem, but I could find no help. How can I get help in ending this problem, 
or at least in understanding it? This is important, as I hope to marry him 
someday. 
</P>
<P>
A. I can't imagine what research you could have done, since you write as though 
you had been told nothing about transvestism. Before marrying this man, you 
definitely should talk to a psychologist specializing in this kind of behavior 
-- in hopes of understanding it. 
</P>
<P>
I don't think there is much point in trying to "end this problem." But if you 
do love this man and want to marry him, you should know that you would be 
joining a great many wives who know that their husbands do feel compelled to 
dress like women at times. It is not an addiction. It is a powerful psychic 
need, established a long time ago, even before he was 6. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities agree that the majority of married transvestites are not 
homosexual. In fact, they like women so much that they need to dress like them. 
I can't make you understand that in so many words, which is why you must talk 
to a counselor or psychotherapist. Not for him but for you, to help you 
understand.

For the first time in almost a century, there will be the patter of little feet 
in the Mississippi governor's mansion. Gov. Ray Mabus and his wife, Julie, are 
expecting their first child in July. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so excited I've been about to pop," said grandmother-to-be Lucille Mabus 
of Ackerman. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement is making this a special season at the 145-year-old mansion.

"I've never seen them light up so much," said spokesman Lori Freeman. "The 
staff is happy. We feel like this is the best Christmas present ever." 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old governor said he doesn't have his heart set on a Ray III or a 
Julie Jr. "I just want it to be a healthy child," Mabus said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Elbert R. Hilliard, executive director of the state Department of Archives and 
History, said Monday that the only earlier reference to a baby being born to a 
sitting governor and his wife goes back to the turn of the century. 
</P>

The governor and Julie Hines, 37, were married on Jan. 3, 1987, in Jackson.

Actor James Naughton, whose life has taken that familiar theatrical tour of 
hard work for years only to be declared an overnight success, says acting is as 
much fun as baseball. 
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old performer's characterization of a tough-talking private eye 
turned him into a star when the Broadway musical "City of Angels" opened last 
week. Naughton, who has a long list of stage and film credits, landed a plum 
off-Broadway role as early as 1971 in "Long Day's Journey Into Night" with 
Geraldine Fitzgerald and Stacy Keach. 
</P>
<P>
He acts, he says, because "It's a lot of fun. It's the same kind of fun as when 
I was a kid. And to be able to continue to do that, it's sort of like playing 
baseball. You see these guys who are 40 years old and they're still playing 
ball and they say, 'I'm the luckiest man in the world to be able to play this 
kids' game for so long and so successfully.' And it's the same with acting."

The accident, which injured no one, occurred about a mile west of the site of a 
4:30 a.m. street scuffle Green had with heavyweight champion Mike Tyson on Aug. 
23, 1988, in front of Dapper Dan's Boutique. Tyson reportedly fractured his 
right hand when he smashed Green in the face, opening a gash between his eyes 
and closing Green's right eye. 
</P>
<P>
Green filed a misdemeanor assault complaint against Tyson but dropped it after 
the champ promised to give him a fight if he "got his act together."

Denver Nuggets center Danny Schayes will undergo surgery to remove bone spurs 
from his right ankle, which will likely sideline him for three to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Schayes, hindered by either injury or foul trouble throughout this season, has 
played in only 12 of 23 games. He has undergone bone scans and X-rays in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Schayes attempted to practice Monday but quit in pain after about 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Surgery is scheduled Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he might miss the entire season, Schayes said, "I don't think so. Not 
from what the tests show." 
</P>
<P>
Schayes said doctors might also perform arthroscopic surgery on his left foot. 
"They might scope it to clean out all the debris," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schayes' problems began with an injury to his left ankle. He said he might have 
overcompensated and put too much stress on his right foot.

HIALEAH PARK BETTING LICENSE LIFTED; 
</P>
<P>
RACING: AN EMERGENCY STATE ORDER SHUTS DOWN THE HISTORIC TRACK BECAUSE IT 
ALTERED ITS SCHEDULE WITHOUT APPROVAL.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Florida Department of Business Regulation said it will suspend Hialeah 
Park's pari-mutuel license because the historic track altered its racing 
schedule without state approval. 
</P>
<P>
The department's emergency order will at least temporarily shut down the 
track's troubled meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Hialeah Park owner John Brunetti and his attorney, Barry Richard, informed of 
the state's plans Monday, promised to appeal the order to the 3rd District 
Court of Appeals in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
If Hialeah can persuade the court to grant a stay, the track can continue 
running its abbreviated schedule until a full hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"I never have expectations with an appellate court," Richard said of Hialeah's 
outlook. 
</P>
<P>
Brunetti had planned to be closed today through Friday. Saturday was to be the 
first day Brunetti would test his revised three-day race schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Under its original schedule, Hialeah was to be open today. By closing, the 
track would be in violation of its license, which requires that it run six days 
a week through May. 
</P>
<P>
The state's emergency order is based on the grounds that the Division of 
Pari-Mutuel Wagering no longer can adequately regulate pari-mutuel activity at 
Hialeah under the chaotic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Brunetti decided to abbreviate Hialeah's schedule because the track has lost an 
estimated $68,000 per day since it opened Nov. 18.

BIRD DOESN'T SOAR AS HIGH AS HE USED TO; AND CELTICS LANGUISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
OK, so what is the matter with Larry Bird? 
</P>
<P>
His heels are fine. The Boston Celtics are satisfied he has no physical 
problems. Entering tonight's game in Milwaukee against the Bucks, Bird is 
averaging 23.3 points, 10 rebounds and 6.9 assists in 37.7 minutes a game. All 
but his rebound average are team highs. He is also leading the club in steals 
and turnovers and is second in blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
But no one who watches the Celtics with any regularity can be deceived by such 
numbers. Mr. Evergreen clearly has had a rough re-entry from a year's idleness, 
and one cannot help but suspect it's having a trickledown effect on his 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
It might be simplistic to resurrect that timeworn adage, "As Bird Goes, So Go 
The Celtics," but that generally was true when a healthy Bird was winning most 
valuable player awards and the team was collecting the Larry O'Brien Trophy 
from a champagne-doused Commissioner David Stern with Brent Musburger close at 
hand to ask the pertinent questions. 
</P>
<P>
Now, both Bird and the Celtics are struggling, providing everyone a glimpse of 
the flip side to the "As Bird Goes . . . " theory. It's a side we haven't seen 
-- we all assumed last year's plunge was because of Bird's foot injuries but 
one that, in retrospect, is perfectly understandable. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, are the Celtics at the stage where they're only as good as 
their struggling superstar? Have they grown so dependent on him -- even after a 
year's absence -- that he carries them down as well as up? The evidence seems 
to suggest that is the case. 
</P>
<P>
Before he was hurt, there was never a question as to who wore the pants for the 
Celtics on and off the court. Bird would throw chairs in the locker room if he 
wasn't satisfied. He would rip teammates for not setting picks or other 
perceived transgressions. He felt qualified and obligated to do so. And people 
listened. 
</P>
<P>
But like a politician who has lost his constituency, or a speaker who has lost 
his audience, Bird cannot come across as the unflagging, take-charge guy if he 
isn't, well, taking charge. Everyone simply assumed he would reaffirm his 
status as the club's consummate whip-cracker and everything would naturally 
flow from there. 
</P>
<P>
"Larry still has the same bearing and demeanor that he always has had," Boston 
General Manager Jan Volk says. "He still is a personality and a force off the 
court." 
</P>
<P>
But Volk also says: "The biggest part of Larry's leadership role in the past 
has been to lead by example. And he's not there, yet. The effort is there and 
there is a fine line between very good and great. He has to get back over that 
line. I think he'd be the first to acknowledge he has a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
He does. It's easy to note he is incapable of playing one-on-one defense 
against anyone with a modicum of quickness. That's why Bird speaks forcefully 
about the need for others to help on defense. He can't do it alone, which 
doesn't exactly make him the most credible spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
It's also easy to point to Bird's shooting, which is the most glaring and 
visible of his weaknesses. There have been far too many Phyllis Diller shooting 
nights, including the nine for 27 effort against the Lakers Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In nine games this season -- or 40% of the time -- Bird has shot less than 40% 
from the field. In his last healthy season, 1987-88, he shot under 40% only 11 
times. This season, he is shooting 45.7%, which may be all right for the 
Washington Bullets' Jeff Malone but is unacceptable for Bird. 
</P>
<P>
That is one reason behind Boston Coach Jimmy Rodgers' share the wealth 
philosophy, which Bird has had trouble accepting. Bird is the foremost 
proponent of deregulation. The fewer constraints, the better. No constraints is 
downright Utopian. 
</P>
<P>
Bird always has been given a long leash -- some would say no leash -- but there 
was an implicit understanding that such widespread latitude also produced 
dividends. He would win games. He would exhort teammates. He would make the big 
play. When others couldn't, he could. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Bird has done little of the above, which may make him uneasy about 
assuming any leadership role. And are his teammates any less culpable if they 
delegated leadership authority to Bird simply because of who he was rather than 
what he did? Is it fair to ask so much of Bird given everything he went through 
-- and is still going through -- when the team and league is changing all 
around him? 
</P>
<P>
The question of leadership always is a touchy and risky one. There's nothing 
worse than having someone try to be what he is not. Or cannot be. But in the 
past, Bird stepped forward and everyone else got out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
One source close to the Celtics recently suggested Bird no longer is interested 
in refiring his leadership rockets. The suggestion was that the fire wasn't 
there as it once was. All of his good friends from years past -- Quinn Buckner, 
Bill Walton, Artis Gilmore -- are gone. And in their places are players he 
barely knows. 
</P>
<P>
If there was one "given" this season, it was that Bird would fill the 
leadership void from last year. If he can't, or won't, the Celtics will find it 
hard not to drift aimlessly, which is exactly what they did last season.
