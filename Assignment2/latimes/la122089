And now, new tales about USC's controversial marching band, the group that 
isn't always what it seems to be. 
</P>
<P>
In our last episode, you may recall, we mentioned that the current Trojan band 
includes a handful of professionals who are non-students. 
</P>
<P>
While band officials compared these "teaching assistants" to assistant coaches 
on a college football team, the difference, of course, is that assistant 
coaches do not make tackles and throw passes during games. 
</P>
<P>
This band summoned forth memories of the school's legendary 1966 group, which 
had such a poor turnout that non-musicians were recruited to simply carry 
instruments to fill out the ranks. It became known as the "Library Band" for 
its lack of volume. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes Bill Walleck of Bent Parade Floats, who recalls another unique USC 
band -- the one that marched behind a convertible carrying then-First Lady Pat 
Nixon in the 1973 Tournament of Roses Parade. 
</P>
<P>
The front line of uniformed, instrument-carrying Trojans, Walleck learned, was 
composed of Secret Service agents. 
</P>
<P>
While we're on the subject of undercover officers, how about a salute for the 
Smog Police of the South Coast Air Quality Management District? They've had a 
big year, targeting 78,000 polluting vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Prospective members of the Smog Police force do not have to take a physical. 
Anyone can join (sort of like the situation with the 1966 USC band). All you 
have to do is phone 1-800-CUT-SMOG when you see a smoking car, or fill out and 
mail one of the agency's citation blanks. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of such a sighting receives a letter from the AQMD, which requests 
that any needed repairs be made. 
</P>
<P>
While it's a voluntary program, the agency says that about 15% to 20% of the 
selected subjects do send in proof that they've repaired their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Citizen support for the program seems to be increasing. After all, few would 
argue with the notion that all of L.A. should be a nonsmoking-car section. 
</P>
<P>
Los Feliz Boulevard has a Christmasy kind of ring to it -- "Feliz Navidad" is a 
holiday standard. So you'd think that there'd be a cheery story behind the 
name. Especially when it translates loosely as "The Happy Ones." 
</P>
<P>
Alas, no. 
</P>
<P>
The boulevard, south of Griffith Park, runs along the old path used a century 
and a half ago by one Domingo Los Feliz, a wealthy rancher. 
</P>
<P>
In his later years, Los Feliz took a beautiful young bride, Maria del Rosario 
Villa. There was a great celebration with food and music (though this was 
before the time of USC marching bands). 
</P>
<P>
Los Feliz's love proved stronger than hers, however, and Maria soon ran off 
with a drifter from Sonora, Mexico, named Alipas. The prideful Los Feliz chased 
them down and retrieved his wayward wife in San Gabriel. But on their horseback 
ride home, he was ambushed by Alipas, who stabbed him to death, according to 
Lee Shippey, author of "It's a California Custom." 
</P>
<P>
Alipas and Mrs. Los Feliz were jailed in L.A. The case dragged on. Finally, a 
vigilante committee hanged the illicit lovers. 
</P>
<P>
Thus ended the unhappy story of Los Feliz. 
</P>
<P>
Worried about that post-holiday letdown? Here's something to look forward to: 
The City of Industry has been chosen to host the first annual Great Snail 
Festival from March 30 through April 1. 
</P>
<P>
A press release says that the event will create "a light-hearted atmosphere of 
games and entertainment" with "activities such as the 'snail toss.' " 
</P>
<P>
Light-hearted, at least, from the humans' point of view. 
</P>
<P>
It will probably become another California custom.

LOGIC GETS A SKINNING WHEN 'FAUX' REPLACES FOX; 
</P>

FASHION: IF YOU WOULDN'T WEAR THE SKIN OF A DEAD ANIMAL, WHY WEAR APPAREL THAT 
PASSES FOR THE REAL THING?

Fake fur and animal prints are everywhere one looks this shopping season. From 
the lingerie to the shoe departments, from home furnishings to automobile 
accessories, merchandisers have decreed "faux" to be the real thing. 
Animal-rights activists are claiming the lion's share of the credit for this 
fashion trend, in which they see reflected a more humane, less human-centered 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Given the vicissitudes of fashion, the exact impact of the anti-fur forces is 
hard to gauge. Whether fur sales are down, up or holding steady seems to depend 
upon whose figures you read. But it is certainly conceivable that, after the 
anti-fur onslaught of the past few years, some women and men, tired of being 
bombarded with slogans like "Cruelty is never chic," would feel relieved to 
hear that fake fur is fashionably, as well as politically, "correct" this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the animal-rights movement can claim victory in this trend toward the 
artificial, though, one must wonder at the logic of fake fur as a political 
statement. One of the movement's favorite slogans is "Real people wear fake 
fur." Why? Do gun-control advocates display replicas of firearms in their 
homes? Do anti-smokers give their children candy cigarettes? Why should "real 
people," ostensibly those who have achieved a higher plane of ethical 
consciousness, wear fake fur at all? And if they do, just what sort of message 
are they sending? 
</P>
<P>
For years, fake fur was a fashion untouchable; it was so obviously synthetic. 
Now, reputable designers are using fake fur precisely because technology has 
made it look real. In other words, it looks, and sometimes feels, like the skin 
of an animal. As far as anyone knows, the person wearing the fake fur is 
wearing the pelt of an animal trapped or farm-bred under conditions that the 
animal-rights movement roundly condemns. Even more problematic is the fake that 
appears to be the coat of a rare or endangered species. It is hard to see how, 
exactly, one proclaims one's compassion for furred creatures by wearing what 
appears to be the pelt of a jaguar or an ocelot or a tiger. 
</P>
<P>
The fake-fur trend, as championed by the animal-rights movement, seems to 
suggest a peculiar form of double-think. Given the behavior of some 
animal-rights advocates, it is tempting to attribute this logical lapse to mere 
muddle-headedness. What else could explain why Jane Wiedlin, a former member of 
the Go-Gos, showed up in a leather-look jacket at last February's "Rock Against 
Fur" concert in New York, sponsored by People for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals? Around the same time, various animal-rights voices were excoriating 
"Animal Lovin' Barbie" for wearing animal prints, on the apparent assumption 
that little girls might mistake hot-pink leopard spots for real fur. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-fur protesters also demonstrate a curious ambivalence regarding the 
treatment of real furs. The Animals' Agenda (one of the movement's more 
influential publications) has repeatedly suggested that enlightened fur-owners 
donate their furs to be used as "props" in anti-fur protests. One such prop 
appeared on the evening news, dangling from a leg-hold trap. This hardly 
conveys much "respect" for animals. Other animal-rights advocates have 
asserted, with perhaps more ethical consistency, that the only legitimate way 
to treat a fur is to give it a decent burial. (One cannot help but wonder 
whether it is politically correct to wear a fake fur while doing so.) 
</P>
<P>
Logical coherence is hardly a hallmark of the animal-rights movement. However, 
the fake-fur fascination of the anti-fur lobby seems to betray a more deeply 
rooted hypocrisy than it does a mere inability to think straight. Never mind 
that this alternative is produced from environmentally polluting 
petrochemicals. Never mind that anti-fur boycotts have had disastrous economic 
effects on native human communities here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Is it easier to oppose fur fashions now that almost-perfect fakes are 
available? Do actions speak louder than words? If so, then all "real people" 
(whether they are pro- or anti-fur) should agree that you cannot stand up for 
animals' well-being by pretending to wear their coats.

MASSAGER GIVES ACHING MUSCLES GOOD VIBRATIONS 
</P>

<P>
Body Vibes is a flexible, tubelike massager you can manipulate over sore, 
hard-to-reach muscles in much the same way you use a bath towel to dry your 
back. 
</P>
<P>
The lightweight massager, which is 46 inches long and three inches around, 
pulsates at two speeds. It's quiet, so you can drape it around your neck or 
wrap it around your waist while sitting in the office, or while on a plane or a 
train. You can even tie a loop in it and massage a sore leg. 
</P>
<P>
Body Vibes, which comes in blue, yellow or pink, operates on two C batteries 
that fit in each end of the tube. Manufactured by Conair Corp. in Stamford, 
Conn., the massager has a suggested retail price of $32.99 and is available 
nationwide at drug, discount and department stores. In the Los Angeles area, 
Body Vibes is available at K mart, Revco, Sav-on, Thrifty and Fedco. If you 
can't find it in your area, call Conair's toll-free hot line, (800) 326-1236.

Football Lovers Will Appreciate FanDomes 
</P>
<P>
Need a stocking stuffer for the professional football fan in your life? Take a 
look at FanDomes, plastic snowdomes that represent the 28 National Football 
League teams. 
</P>
<P>
Each 3-inch-high, water-filled FanDome features an NFL team's logo displayed on 
a miniature helmet sitting on a tiny football field. There are also goal posts 
and a free-floating football inside. 
</P>
<P>
Shake the FanDome, and you'll think you're watching snow fly at a late-season 
game in Cleveland, Green Bay or Denver. If you shake it carefully, you just 
might be able to get that football through the goal posts for a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Developed by Los Angeles entrepreneur Ron Kaiser, a football fan and snowdome 
collector, FanDomes are available nationwide in sporting goods stores, stadium 
shops, department stores and gift shops. In the Los Angeles area, FanDomes can 
be purchased at Scoreboard stores, J.C. Penney, Pro Image and at the Pro-Jersey 
departments in Montgomery Ward. They retail for about $6.50. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a fan of another professional sport, hold on. Kaiser plans snowdomes 
for teams in the National Basketball Assn., the National Hockey League and in 
Major League Baseball by late spring. 
</P>
<P>
Butaflame Candles Light Up Parties 
</P>
<P>
If you're planning holiday dinner parties, you might want to consider Butaflame 
butane candles, which are long-burning and won't leave wax drippings on your 
tablecloth. 
</P>
<P>
Manufactured by Tampus Gifts Inc. in Irwindale, Calif., the aluminum candles 
come in 12- or 15-inch lengths, are available in 18 colors and fit most 
candleholders. Tampus president Kirit P. Shah says the company also offers 
matching candleholders in 3-inch or 8-inch heights. 
</P>
<P>
The candles will burn about three to five hours. A pair of 12-inch candles 
costs about $30; a pair of 15-inch candles, about $36. The candlesticks range 
from $38 to $75 a pair. 
</P>
<P>
A can of Butaflame butane fuel provides about 15 hours of burn time and costs 
about $3.50, but you may use other brands of butane fluid. Simply fill each 
candle from the bottom with the butane, wait 10 minutes and light it to ensure 
an even flame. To clean, use a soft cloth dampened with water and a mild 
detergent. 
</P>
<P>
The butane candles are available in Southern California at Wilshire Fireplace 
stores in Beverly Hills and Costa Mesa, and Wicks 'n' Sticks in Ventura. If you 
can't find them in your area, contact Tampus Gifts Inc., 6020 N. Irwindale 
Ave., Unit P, Irwindale, Calif. 91702; (818) 812-4438.

Swiss Army Knives as Fashion Accessories? 
</P>
<P>
There's a new twist to the classic red-and-silver Swiss Army knives that come 
in handy when opening a bottle or trimming a fingernail. This year, they come 
in pastel colors and are designed to be "practical fashion accessories and 
convenient tools for women." 
</P>
<P>
Pastels are made by Wenger, an official supplier of knives to the Swiss Army 
since 1908. Available in mint-green, blue, pink or slate, the knives are 2 1/2 
inches long when closed. In addition to the pocketknife blade, they feature 
scissors with a springless mechanism and self-sharpening, serrated-edge blades; 
a nail file / cleaner; a toothpick; tweezers, and a key ring. 
</P>
<P>
The suggested retail price is $18, which includes a lifetime warranty. Pastels 
are sold in Southern California at King's Luggage and Gifts in Buena Park, 
Glendale, Pasadena, Montebello, Westminster, Lakewood and Riverside; Beckel's 
Luggage in downtown Los Angeles; Lazar's in Sherman Oaks, and John's Fifth 
Avenue stores in San Diego and Escondido. In other areas, call (800) 431-2996.

SCREEN STYLE: HIGH PRICE, LOW-KEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jaclyn Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Series: "Christine Cromwell," an "ABC Saturday Mystery" movie airing 
monthly. Next installment, Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
The Look: Rich-girl financial adviser Christine Cromwell (Jaclyn Smith, 
pictured here) attains her well-heeled image with demure white blouses, 
designer suits and classic leather pumps. But, in the midst of so much 
understated, expensive dressing there are a few zingers. The blouses in 
particular get top billing for the way they frame the face, enhance the 
complexion and do all the other flattering things designers always say white 
blouses do. The fresh-cut flowers Cromwell wears on her suit lapels are another 
nice touch, and just might start a run on gardenia and rosebud boutonnieres. In 
contrast to Cromwell's understated approach, her Auntie Mame-ish mother 
(Celeste Holm) is an older-woman fashion plate, with a flamboyant wardrobe of 
boldly patterned outfits. 
</P>
<P>
The Labels: No budget specials here. The sportswear Smith promotes for K mart 
stores doesn't cut it on this show. Costume designer Marjorie Bowers explains 
that she built Cromwell's wardrobe from a single point of view: "We tried to 
establish her as having money from way back." Donna Karan and Gianni Versace, 
along with Chanel and Armani, help support the image. As for Cromwell's flashy 
mother, a lot of her clothes carry the Escada label. 
</P>
<P>
The Stores: Most of the clothes come from designer boutiques in Los Angeles. 
Some are from specialty stores including Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and 
I. Magnin. And a few items come from Smith's own closet. One, a black sequined 
evening dress with a cut-out back, which made its first appearance on the 
show's first episode in November, was a knockout. It and others are likely to 
turn up again on future episodes. "She's a working woman, she doesn't have an 
unlimited wardrobe," Bowers says of the stylish sleuth. 
</P>
<P>
The Costumer: A former ready-to-wear designer, Bowers plucked the fashion plum 
of the season when she signed onto this project. The lavish budget allowed for 
16 designer outfits in the first episode, priced from about $1,500 up, 
establishing Cromwell as a clotheshorse before the show's credits ever started 
to roll. 
</P>
<P>
The Script: A pretty, younger partner at one of San Francisco's high-powered 
investment management firms, our heroine gets entangled with the powerful 
clients her boss (Ralph Bellamy) has to untangle from white-collar crimes. She 
can handle it -- she's more than just another stylish dresser. She's got an 
MBA, a law degree, and experience as a public defender. 
</P>
<P>
The Conflict: Since Smith has had so many professional images, from "Charlie's 
Angel" to miniseries leading lady to makeup-and-perfume spokeswoman, it was up 
to Bowers to create something new. More than that, "there had to be a hook that 
separates Cromwell from other professional women on TV," Bowers explains. That 
led to the character's pristine fashion approach, with skirts just above the 
knee, necklines high, backs low. Bowers says that the young executive dresses 
very similarly to the off-camera Smith. "We went through Jaclyn's closet to see 
her life-style choices, then struck a balance between the role and the 
actress," Bowers says. 
</P>
<P>
The Payoff: Simplicity can be seductive. And it doesn't always have to be 
expensive. Of all her swanky designer-label selections, Cromwell never looks 
better than when she drips out of the shower and pops on a plush white 
terry-cloth robe. She ought to put that one in her recycler bin. Jaclyn Smith

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: HOW TO HANDLE FITS OF ANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's said that people have more difficulty coping with anger than with any 
other single problem. How much do you know about handling resentment and rage? 
Here's a chance to test your views. Answer true or false. 
</P>
<P>
1. The healthiest, best way to cope with anger is to ventilate it -- "let it 
all hang out." 
</P>
<P>
2. Fantasizing can help people deal with anger. 
</P>
<P>
3. Humor and anger are incompatible. 
</P>
<P>
4. If you're really angry, stop what you're doing, get down to the business of 
talking, and settle matters once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
5. Being totally honest at all times is a way to avoid and overcome anger. 
</P>
<P>
6. Children who abuse their toys or who bully other children may be making a 
statement about their inability to handle anger. 
</P>
<P>
7. Everybody feels better after expressing anger. 
</P>
<P>
8. Passion and anger are basically the same. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWERS: 
</P>
<P>
1. FALSE. This is usually not a constructive way to cope with rage, for 
although the time to "let it all hang out" may be right for you, it may be 
wrong for the other person. You may end up worse off than before. 
</P>
<P>
2. TRUE. Daydreaming or fantasizing about what you'd like to do to your boss, 
your ex or even to a bad-tempered child won't hurt anyone, and it can be a 
safety valve. You never need to feel guilty about your fantasies as long as you 
don't act them out. 
</P>
<P>
3. FALSE. While laughter is often a good release for anger, most humor has a 
certain amount of rage at its core. Many jokes are disguised rage. 
</P>
<P>
4. FALSE. This may not be a good idea because if your emotions are too charged, 
you may not be able to be rational. Often, it's better to wait, take time out, 
count to 20, walk around the block or go to a movie, before attempting to 
confront the issues. 
</P>
<P>
5. FALSE. As Laura Singer, past president of the American Assn. for Marriage 
and Family Therapy, pointed out, to be honest at all times is really to act out 
a lot of aggression and hostility. 
</P>
<P>
6. TRUE. Such youngsters often attack toys, animals or other children because 
they're afraid to express any negative feelings to parents or other adults. The 
child who is too sweet, too perfect with adults may be sitting on a mountain of 
rage. 
</P>
<P>
7. FALSE. This is a dangerous myth. Often people feel worse after blowing up 
and letting all their rage fall where it may. This kind of freedom of 
expression usually ends up exacerbating the problem. 
</P>
<P>
8. FALSE. Often people like to excuse destructive displays of temper with the 
excuse that they're passionate. Passion doesn't mean a lack of control, but 
rather an intensity of feeling. 
</P>
<P>
If you answered six of these questions correctly, you're better informed than 
most on this subject.

They come to see Dustin Hoffman, but at intermission they're talking about

That is not the usual reaction to "The Merchant of Venice" in performance --

most productions. As a result, a problem play comes into its own as a romantic 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with "The Merchant," especially for modern audiences, is Shylock. 
Although he appears in only five scenes, he oppresses the story like a bad 
conscience. How can we smile at a fairy-tale comedy whose "villain" is, to our 
eyes, a victim of the rankest anti-Semitism? 
</P>
<P>
Hall doesn't soften the cruelty of the Shylock scenes. Indeed, he intensifies 
it. The Christian merchant Antonio (Leigh Lawson) doesn't merely inform the 
Jewish money lender Shylock (Hoffman) that he is quite ready to spit in his 
face. He does so. And Hoffman's Shylock must wipe his brow and pretend -- or 
pretend to pretend -- that this is a little joke that the two men have between 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Later we see Shylock physically manhandled when his case against Antonio is 
thrown out of court. Because Hoffman's Shylock has so little harm in him -- 
apart from the harm implanted by his Christian adversaries -- these moments 
have force. 
</P>
<P>
And yet the final scene of the play is all moonlight and charm. Portia's 
adventure in the courtroom is over, the lovers are reunited (with the men 
having learned a little lesson) and Antonio, the lonely merchant, will not be 
left out in the cold. Portia (Geraldine James) and Bassanio (Nathaniel Parker) 
turn at the door of her mansion and signal to him: Come in. 
</P>
<P>
A lovely image. Do we reflect that this is the same Antonio earlier seen 
spitting in the face of a harmless Jew? Only in retrospect. For the moment, 
Hall gives Shakespeare the scene he seems to want, and leaves it to the viewer 
to sort out the contradictions in the play. 
</P>
<P>
Or are they contradictions in human nature? What the final scene said to me was 
that the same person -- Portia, say -- can be exquisitely sensitive to the 
unspoken needs of a friend while being totally oblivious to the humanity of a 
person -- Shylock, say -- who is perceived as a member of a lower caste. That's 
far more telling than playing Portia and her circle as spoiled aristocrats who 
don't care a pin for anybody. 
</P>
<P>
It also lends interest to those scenes in the play in which Shylock doesn't 
appear, which is to say most of them. This "Merchant of Venice" has many 
stories to tell, among them the tale of a restless heiress who finally finds 
employment for her intelligence in the lower courts, even if she does have to 
pretend to be a man. James' Portia grows more and more likable -- to herself, 
as well -- as she takes her life into her own hands: a sort of reverse Hedda 
Gabler. If Parker's Bassanio doesn't strike us as much of a prize, perhaps she 
will make something of him. 
</P>
<P>
It is harder to say what's up with Lawson's Antonio, but the opening scenes 
make it clear that he, too, feels himself in a kind of cage, perhaps relating 
to his feelings for the very same Bassanio. Like everyone in the company, actor 
Lawson makes his lines come from a real place, without habitually stopping to 
take his character's emotional temperature, as bad American Shakespearean 
actors do. The text drives the play, like film speeding through a movie 
projector. 
</P>
<P>
How does Dustin Hoffman adapt to this style of acting? Like an athlete. 
Vocally, he is in tune with the rest of the company: not a question of accent, 
but of voice placement, phrasing and, above all, confidence. He's got the words 
and the music now, as may not have been the case when he played Shylock for 
Hall in London last summer. 
</P>
<P>
It is also a fully rounded characterization. Hoffman's Shylock is a little man 
who knows his own worth and who knows exactly how much he is prepared to take 
from these Christians. There are meaningful pauses toward the end of the "Hath 
not a Jew eyes?" speech, where Shylock reminds his listeners that, pushed far 
enough, a man will take a man's revenge. The proposition is exactly the one 
that Malcolm X used to make toward whites ("If you want to know what I'll do, 
think what you'd do") and Hoffman reads it in a quiet, measured voice that 
brings utter stillness to the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
This is a man to be reckoned with. On the whole, though, Hoffman's Shylock 
wants to get along. Rather than a Venetian magnifico, he suggests a small 
businessman with plenty of practice in chatting up a customer. This is partly a 
pose, but not entirely -- there's some native whimsy here. 
</P>
<P>
He has learned to listen, as members of an endangered minority must. And he has 
learned to shut off. When the abuse gets too strong, we see him draw into 
himself: I am not going to let this touch me. 
</P>
<P>
There's little of the mythic Shylock in Hoffman's portrayal, but few actors 
have had a firmer grasp on what it must feel like to be Shylock, particularly 
after his fall. "You take my life when you do take the means whereby I live" 
isn't self-pity. It is the simple truth. And where is "mercy" now that the 
Christians are in charge? 
</P>
<P>
Impossible to believe that Shakespeare didn't feel compassion here. Yet his 
duty -- and Hall's -- is to the fairy story, and it whirls back in like music, 
with only a little uneasiness about the future of Shylock's runaway daughter, 
Jessica (Francesca Buller), whose marriage to Lorenzo (Richard Garnett) seems 
not to have taken. Their teasing is a little too real. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Dyer's set is a Venetian square that can turn into a lady's chamber in 
one light cue. Nothing encumbers the flow of the play, yet each scene finds its 
own pace and its own specific gravity, including the droll business when 
Portia's exotic and hopeless suitors come to call. This "Merchant of Venice" 
isn't the editorial that another director -- perhaps Hall himself in his 
younger days -- would have made it. And it is certainly not a star vehicle. But 
what a good story!

Was Jackson Video Hijacked?"A Current Affair" was ready to air an exclusive 
home video of Michael Jackson on Monday and Tuesday nights, until Jackson's 
lawyers showed up at the last minute and prevented the show from running the 
video as planned, according to the syndicated show's executive producer, Gerald 
Stone. "A Current Affair" had gotten the video from Steve Howell, a cameraman 
who worked with Jackson on some videos and had taken extra footage of Jackson 
around his house. Stone said Howell told "A Current Affair" that Jackson gave 
up the rights to the video, but Jackson's lawyers claimed the video was 
"hijacked," and Howell did not have legal access to it. "A Current Affair" 
smelled a news story, and on Monday did a piece on the confusion surrounding 
the tape (another segment was scheduled for Tuesday night). While the program 
used excerpts from the tape as part of the news story, "in deference to Michael 
Jackson, we didn't run the whole thing," Stone said. He added that Howell 
denied Jackson's attorneys' accusations. Shauna Snow

Kurosawa to be Honored: Japanese film maker Akira Kurosawa will receive an 
honorary award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences at the 62nd 
Annual Academy Awards show on March 26. Kurosawa, 79, will be recognized "for 
his cinematic accomplishments that have inspired, delighted, enriched and 
entertained worldwide audiences and influenced film makers throughout the 
world." Kurosawa's 1951 production of "Rashomon" won the Oscar for Best Foreign 
Language Film and is generally credited with turning the western world's 
attention to the work of Japanese film makers. Shauna Snow

JAZZ NOTES: HOLIDAY MUSIC FROM THE DUKE AND BUCK; 'NEWPORT JAZZ '89' WILL AIR 
ON KCET 
</P>

If you've decided you just have to wait up for Santa on Christmas Eve, we've 
got the perfect musical accompaniment for your vigil: seven hours of classic 
Duke Ellington music as programmed by John Breckow on his "Smoke Rings" radio 
show, beginning at 11 p.m. Sunday on KPFK (90.7 FM). 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be emphasizing the suites, like the 'Degas Suite,' the 'Queen's Suite' 
and Ellington's adaptation, with Billy Strayhorn, of Tchaikovsky's 
'Nutcracker,' " said Breckow, who has been hosting the Sunday all-nighter for 
more than a dozen years. "These longer pieces were more introspective, softer, 
prettier, which makes them seem appropriate for the holiday season." 
</P>
<P>
Breckow has another special ready for New Year's Eve, when he will program "A 
Tribute to Buck Clayton," the 78-year-old former trumpeter noted for his work 
with Count Basie in the '30s and '40s and for his well-crafted, swinging 
arrangements for Basie and other bands, including his own. 
</P>
<P>
"Buck, who was the master of the shout chorus, has recently revitalized his 
writing career, since he stopped playing some years ago," said Breckow. "He's 
writing music for his own big band, and for the Alden-Barrett Quintet. When 
playing Buck's originals and arrangements, the latter group (led by guitarist 
Howard Alden and trombonist Dan Barrett) sounds like Basie's band at the 
Roseland Ballroom in New York in 1938. It's fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
Breckow indicated he would feature Clayton's big band, the Alden-Barrett 
quintet, as well as selected recordings from throughout Clayton's career, on 
the Dec. 31 broadcast. Information: (818) 980-8745, 985-2711. 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for a more contemporary mix of jazz, and you want visuals to 
boot, check out "Newport Jazz '89," airing at 12:30 a.m. Friday on KCET 
(Channel 28). Among the artists featured on the show, which was taped in New 
York last summer, will be singers Mel Torme and Diane Reeves, flutist Herbie 
Mann, pianist George Shearing and trumpeter Wynton Marsalis. The numbers range 
from Mann's "Memphis Underground" to Marsalis' version of Charlie Parker's 
"Chasin' the Bird." 
</P>
<P>
Marsalis returns later with strictly seasonal songs on "A Classical/Jazz 
Christmas with Wynton Marsalis," airing at 9 p.m. Friday, also on KCET. On the 
program, the crafty trumpeter leads his current sextet in holiday favorites 
from a live concert at New York's Lincoln Center. The selections -- "Little 
Drummer Boy," " 'Twas the Night Before Christmas" and "Let It Snow, Let It 
Snow, Let It Snow" among them -- will be drawn from Marsalis' recent new 
holiday album, "Crescent City Christmas Card" (CBS). 
</P>
<P>
Swing's the thing, and may it remain so. At least that's the way Chuck Foster 
feels. The bandleader recently celebrated not only his 50th year in show 
business, but also his 25th year of big band sessions at Myron's Ballroom in 
downtown Los Angeles, where he plays for listeners and dancers from 4-10 p.m. 
Sundays. "I went down to hear him at the Biltmore Bowl years ago and thought he 
was great," said Myrna Myron, who has operated Myron's since 1946, and owned 
the building since 1982. "So you know how happy I am to have him playing for 
us." Information: (213) 748-3054. 
</P>
<P>
**** "The Place to Be" (Steeplechase) is somewhat of a return for the solid 
mainstream tenor saxophonist Junior Cook, who, while remaining active in 
Manhattan, has not been heard from on record in some time. Working here with 
pianist Mickey Tucker, bassist Wayne Dockery and drummer Leroy Williams -- 
veteran colleagues all -- Cook, a former star with Horace Silver's quintet in 
the '60s, shows that he is as potent as ever. He offers driving, resplendent 
lines on the faster tunes like Parker's "She Rote," crackles on the medium 
tempo swingers like Benny Golson's "Are You Real" and Tadd Dameron's enchanting 
"Gnid" and is in with singing, provocative statements on Tucker's bluesy 
ballad, "I Should Have Known." The pianist has plenty of good things to say and 
Williams and Dockery are there with just-so support throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 Records are rated from one to five stars. ***** means a swinging must-have for 
the jazz lover; * means save your pennies, Benny.

Eubanks Apologizes: Speaking of "Roger and Me," television personality Bob 
Eubanks has issued a statement of regret for an offensive joke about Jews and 
AIDS he tells in the documentary film. Eubanks was preparing to be filmed by 
director Roger Moore in Flint, Mich., where Eubanks is a native son, when he 
told a tasteless gag to the film's crew. Eubanks reputedly never knew the crew 
had the joke on tape until someone who had seen the film told him it was part 
of the movie. "It was not my intention to harm, insult or in any way demean the 
Jewish people or persons with AIDS," said the one-time host of "The Newlywed 
Game" in a prepared statement. Shauna Snow

BEN BARZMAN; SCREENWRITER BLACKLISTED IN MCCARTHY ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ben Barzman, who was forced to abandon a successful screenwriting career when 
he was placed on a McCarthy-era blacklist, died Friday in Santa Monica. He was 
79 and had suffered a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
A journalist, novelist and author of musical revues, he turned to screenwriting 
with "True to Life" in 1943. He was to write or co-write several well-known 
pictures, among them "The Boy With the Green Hair," "Back to Bataan," "El Cid," 
"The Fall of the Roman Empire," "Z," "The Blue Max," "The Visit" and "Heroes of 
Telemark." Some did not reflect his screen credit because of the blacklist, 
said his wife, Norma. 
</P>
<P>
Barzman left Hollywood in the late 1940s, but unlike many of his fellow 
craftsmen, it was not to avoid a subpoena. He and his wife, a successful 
journalist and scenarist, went to London in 1949, where they had been invited 
by Edward Dmytryk, one of the two survivors of the famed Hollywood 10. Dmytryk 
was directing Barzman's "Christ in Concrete," based on the Pietro di Donato 
novel, for the J. Arthur Rank Studio. 
</P>
<P>
The picture went on to win awards at several European film festivals, but by 
then the Barzmans had been told they would not be welcomed back to Hollywood 
because of their political sympathies. 
</P>
<P>
("Christ in Concrete" has just been purchased by HBO for screening in 1990.) 
</P>
<P>
Barzman, born in Canada, had his naturalized citizenship revoked in 1954 and 
his American passport taken away. It was 1963 before his citizenship was 
restored, said Larry Ceplair and Steven Englund in their book "The Inquisition 
in Hollywood." The government then presented Barzman with a bill for back taxes 
he supposedly owed for his nine years as a non-American. 
</P>
<P>
In the interim the Barzmans lived in London, Paris and Nice, where he wrote 
several films for the French and Italian cinema. 
</P>
<P>
Barzman's novels included "Echo X," published in 1960 and winner of the Science 
Fiction Book-of-the-Month Award. Philosopher Bertrand Russell said of it that 
Barzman "has a rare gift -- he manages to treat serious themes amusingly." 
</P>
<P>
With his wife, he wrote two films, "The Locket" and "Never Say Goodbye," and a 
second novel, "Rich Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
They raised their seven children in Europe, returning to Los Angeles in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982 Ben Barzman was honored with a film retrospective at the Paris 
Cinematheque and in 1985 the French named him an officier of the Order of Arts 
and Letters. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his wife and children, he is survived by five grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. Jan. 7 at Westwood Mortuary.

THE ONLY WAY TO HELP POLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 40 years of communism, Poland is an economic and environmental shambles. 
Its farmers have grown single cash crops for so long they will have to learn 
agriculture all over. Times writer Art Pine reported from Krakow recently that 
30,000 workers at the Lenin steel mill produce no more than what a fraction of 
that number can turn out in South Korea. Inflation is running at an annual rate 
of 450% and economists warn it will be 900% next year without radical reforms. 
A recent Warsaw visitor reports the opening of a new office building that took 
35 years to build, a paradigm for the way the whole country works. But there is 
a way out of this mess -- and it rests with the old-fashioned notion of 
international economic cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
The Poles already know that help is on its way from the United States, Japan 
and European countries and from the International Monetary Fund, but at a 
price. Under a proposed agreement with the IMF, wages must be capped and that 
will produce a 25% loss in buying power next year. Government subsidies must be 
wiped out and that means prices of things like electricity will soar. The 
Polish parliament has begun deciding these and other changes in economic rules 
that could lead to failures of many businesses and to higher prices as the 
nation moves to a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
Alarming? Yes. But visitors find the professors and labor leaders who are 
suddenly in charge of a nation -- with no experience in governing and only a 
vague idea of how a free market works -- determined to change everything at 
once, remarkably optimistic that they can do it, able even to joke about it. 
When President Bush's chief economic adviser, Michael Boskin, began lecturing 
members of the Polish Cabinet on the dangers of taking on too much at once, 
they heard him out and then one responded: The Cabinet member said that 
gradualism would not work and that Poland had no choice but to take what has 
been called the Big Bang approach. Then, with a smile, he added that, anyway, 
like war and generals, moving from communism to a market economy was too 
important a task to be entrusted to economists. 
</P>
<P>
After a slow start, Washington is moving to provide not only food and cash but 
the kind of technical help Poland will need to do such things as create credit 
lines -- something that's second-nature in the West and all but unheard of 
under communism. Some estimates put the value of pledges of aid for Poland as 
high as $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, Warsaw was overwhelmed with visitors from the West, stumbling over 
one another with free-lance offers of aid, taking up the time of Polish 
officials that should have been spent on planning for the radical changes 
involved in creating a market economy from economic rubble. With the IMF about 
to agree on its own contribution of more than $700 million, the West will have 
a traffic controller on the scene to monitor the flow of aid and free up the 
time of Polish officials for more important things than chatting with 
well-intentioned visitors. Next to cash and technical advice, Western nations 
can make no more important a contribution to Poland than cooperating with the 
IMF's traffic controls.

Why does Democratic gubernatorial candidate John Van de Kamp want to encourage 
teaching as a career with two free years of college and a tax on candy (Part A, 
Dec. 12)? Why not give teachers a wage worthy of five years of college to make 
it attractive as a career so they don't go hungry?

MORE MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerome Marmorstein's article ("Our Rights Get a Dose of Malathion," California 
Commentary, Dec. 4) reaffirms, once again, the old adage that a little bit of 
knowledge is a dangerous thing. Like Dr. Marmorstein, I too am concerned about 
the public health and environmental effects of chemical pesticides. However, 
unlike Dr. Marmorstein, I have had the opportunity to study integrated pest 
management at UC Berkeley, to serve as past-president of the Assn. of Applied 
Insect Ecologists, and to travel to countries where the Medfly is 
well-established. 
</P>
<P>
If we do not eradicate the Medfly each time that it is introduced to this state 
by a careless tourist, chemical pesticide use throughout California will 
dramatically increase. The increase will not be temporary, like the current 
aerial spraying, but will last for the rest of our lives. The area affected 
will not be localized, like it is now, but will include millions of acres and 
many cities. 
</P>
<P>
I am not going to argue that malathion is 100% safe. But the dangers of 
localized, temporary malathion treatments are preferable to the permanent, 
widespread spraying that would occur, for the rest of our lives, if the Medfly 
were to be established.

Here's one more taxpayer protesting the malathion spraying over our private 
property -- without our permission -- to benefit a handful of growers when it 
might well be harmful to our health! 
</P>
<P>
Over the years we've enjoyed fresh fruit from our tangelo, orange, lemon and 
grapefruit trees, knowing that they were not tainted with insecticides which 
permeate commercial produce in the markets! 
</P>
<P>
Now, after the recent overnight spraying in our area, we're apprehensive that 
lingering residue from this stuff might get on our hands and clothes while 
working in the yard. A performance like this might be acceptable in Eastern 
Europe, but certainly isn't here.

This continuous spraying of our population with poisonous substances is like

Granted, the Medfly infestation is a serious problem. But if we possess the 
technology to land men on the moon, surely we can devise a less-hazardous 
method of eradication. Any politician supporting aerial spraying of malathion 
will certainly not get my vote.

BUSH'S CYNICAL CHINA SYNDROME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The adjectives cynical and dishonorable already have been used to describe the 
Bush Administration's conduct of Sino-American relations. The word deceitful 
can now be added to the list. 
</P>
<P>
In the immediate aftermath of the bloody suppression of pro-democracy 
demonstrators in Beijing's Tien An Men Square last June, the President publicly 
ordered a suspension of all high-level contacts between U.S. and Chinese 
diplomats. He also halted sales of military supplies to Beijing, and announced 
that Washington would seek a halt to consideration of additional international 
financial loans to China. These steps, Bush then argued, would be sufficient to 
persuade Beijing that as long as it persisted in murderous repression, it could 
not expect to do "business as usual" with the West. 
</P>
<P>
The ban on U.S. military sales was the first of the sanctions to be discarded 
by the Administration. Tuesday, the President abandoned the purely economic 
reprisals when he approved the sale of three civilian communication satellites 
to China and lifted prohibitions on U.S. export-import financing of business 
activities with China. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, the President never had any intention of abiding by his own 
ban on high-level diplomatic contacts. Barely a month after the killings in 
Tien An Men Square Bush dispatched National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft 
and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger on a secret mission to 
Beijing. Now that they have been found out, the Administration's spokesmen 
claim the envoys were sent "to underscore the U.S. shock and concern about the 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, but if the Chinese government, which at that very moment was rounding 
up dissidents and conducting secret executions, read something else into the 
contradiction between Washington's public statements and private conduct, who 
would be surprised? The leaders of China's power elite may be physically 
feeble, but they have a keen appreciation of hypocrisy born of a lifetime's 
practice. The Bush Administration, after all, was talking their language.

SOUTH AFRICA: THE EXPOSURE OF THE CRUMBLING ECONOMIES OF EASTERN EUROPE IS 
AFFECTING BLACK LIBERATION MOVEMENTS THAT ASSUMED SOCIALISM WAS THE WAY OF THE 
FUTURE.

JOHANNESBURG, South Africa 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Only months ago, the nationalization of South Africa's major industries was 
assumed to be a consequence of black majority rule, whenever that might occur. 
</P>
<P>
The debate among black activists and in the townships was on the process rather 
than the need for nationalization. Because of capitalism's failure to show a 
human face and its robust health under apartheid, most blacks worshiped the 
socialist economic system. 
</P>
<P>
Socialist writers had a ready and growing market in the black townships, even 
though their writings were banned. Children were frequently named after Fidel 
Castro, Mao Tse-tung, Leon Trotsky and Vladimir Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
But events in Eastern Europe have thrown the region's crumbling 
state-controlled economies into the world spotlight, with repercussions for 
South Africa's liberation theorists. Many are now asking if the future 
socialist society on which they built their hopes and sacrifices is a realistic 
alternative to the apartheid society they are dismantling. 
</P>
<P>
When the economies of socialist countries were first exposed to be faltering, 
black activists rejected the reports, calling them another manifestation of the 
ages-old campaign against "our socialist brothers." However, the penny has at 
last dropped and it is now accepted that East Bloc socialist governments have 
failed to give their citizens a better life. 
</P>
<P>
Stories of housing shortages and long lines for basic necessities are now 
reluctantly believed. We have seen Poles asking the much-hated capitalists of 
the West to invest in their country. South Africa's neighbor, Mozambique, has 
abandoned Marxism-Leninism as the guiding philosophy for that troubled country. 
Julius Nyerere's African Socialism experiment in Tanzania was a dismal failure. 
</P>
<P>
A prominent entrepreneur in Soweto says that only a fully free economy, with 
the market as sole arbiter, will work. "Look at what is happening in communist 
countries," he said. "They are now begging the West for investments and 
technology." 
</P>
<P>
South Africa's major liberation movement, the African National Congress, now 
promulgates a mixed economy. The Pan Africanist Congress and the Black 
Consciousness movement are still officially committed to a socialist Azania, 
the name for a liberated South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
With time, the latter two are likely to change their tunes, for it is 
increasingly difficult to argue for state-controlled socialism when the world's 
communist countries have admitted the system's serious political, social and 
economic shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
There are other, seemingly insurmountable, hurdles to a socialist economy in 
South Africa. The country's white business community, which controls 90% of the 
wealth and is here to stay, will resist socialism to the bitter end. The 
present captains of industry, robbed of their companies and lives of luxury, 
would do all in their power to ensure the demise of a socialist economy. This 
is the catch that has trapped Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. 
</P>
<P>
Added to this is the lack of a corps of black technocrats, even from the ANC 
and PAC, to ensure that government strategies in a planned economy are carried 
out. 
</P>
<P>
While socialism may no longer be a path for the future, the case for pure 
capitalism is no better, as capitalism shares the blame for South Africa's 
present ills. Capitalism and apartheid are two sides of the same coin; if 
capitalist structures had the welfare of the blacks at heart, they would not 
have pursued labor policies that destroyed black family life and turned 
townships like Soweto into mere reservoirs of workers. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa's future economy must address the present disparities, the most 
obvious being that blacks are the country's workers and consumers, but not its 
producers and employers. If one person, one vote were to come to this country 
tomorrow, today's have-nots would still be in the economic underclass. This is 
not liberation. 
</P>
<P>
Second, an economy that guarantees the freedom of man, his markets and their 
growth is the only base on which to build. The shortcomings of state socialism 
and capitalism have prompted blacks to look at the welfare economies in the 
Scandinavian countries, particularly Sweden. The shopping, however, continues. 
</P>
<P>
While South Africa's blacks are still the only ones on the continent who have 
not attained their liberation from white oppressors, the blessing may be that 
this has placed them in a better position to judge and learn from the 
shortcomings of the Soviets, Chinese, British and Americans. They will then 
come up with a system that will serve their national interests, and not just 
one with appealing rhetoric.

COLD LAKERS NO MATCH FOR BULLS; 
</P>
<P>
NBA: LOS ANGELES HELD TO SEASON-LOW POINT TOTAL IN 93-83 LOSS TO CHICAGO. 
JORDAN SCORES 37. 
</P>

CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prolific as he was, Michael Jordan did not beat the Lakers here Tuesday night. 
The Chicago Bulls, rightfully, took credit for the 93-83 victory. But the 
Lakers really counted this as a self-inflicted loss from an array of errant 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers did it all in recording their season low for points. They missed 
open jump shots. They missed layups. They missed dunks. They missed free throws 
and three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
If the Lakers had not hired a chartered plane late Tuesday night, they might 
have missed their flight out of town, too. The Bulls, meanwhile, flew Air 
Jordan for 37 points and limited the Lakers to 36.4% shooting to win their 
fifth in a row and end the Lakers' four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offense was pathetic at times," Laker Coach Pat Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
He did not need to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The 83 points were the Lakers' lowest total since a 105-79 loss at Utah last 
February. That Tuesday's shooting did not mark a season low -- the Lakers shot 
36.1% against the Golden State Warriors in November -- was only an indication 
that this is a recurring problem. It even translated to the free-throw line, 
where the Lakers made 66.7% 
</P>
<P>
"We were stagnant again," Laker forward James Worthy said. "We were just 
randomly running around. We couldn't execute and couldn't hit shots that 
normally go down." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers (18-6) hit bottom in the third quarter, when they made five of 27 
shots for 18.5%. They weren't discriminating, either, missing eight open jump 
shots, as well as several layups and tip-in attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that, the Lakers trailed by only 10 points entering the fourth quarter 
and cut the margin to five with 8:17 to play. 
</P>
<P>
From that point, though, the Lakers made four of 12 shots. Among those misses 
were a failed slam dunk by Worthy and a blown layup by Larry Drew. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls made 50.7% of their shots. With Jordan and John Paxson (11 points) 
hitting from the outside, Chicago was able to sustain an inside game against 
the shorter Lakers. That resulted in easy baskets for Scottie Pippen, who had 
16 points and 12 rebounds, and Horace Grant, who had 12 points and eight 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he would have liked to give the Bulls total credit for shutting down 
the Lakers, who end an eight-game, 12-day trip tonight against the Minnesota 
Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they did have a heckuva lot to do with it," Riley said, shrugging. "They 
have quick defenders who plug up the things we wanted to try. But we missed a 
lot of layups and open shots. I mean, we were way off." 
</P>
<P>
But, when someone suggested this was a defensive struggle, Riley laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a defensive game?" he asked, incredulously. "It was not high scoring, 
but it definitely was not a defensive game." 
</P>
<P>
There is a difference. The Lakers, more than anyone, know that. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of shots we missed tonight that usually are academic for us," 
Laker forward Orlando Woolridge said. "I guess it was just one of those nights 
for the whole team." 
</P>
<P>
All the Lakers shot poorly, but if anyone stood out, it was shooting guard 
Byron Scott. 
</P>
<P>
Scott went 0 for 7. He missed five open jump shots and was sat down for good 
with 3:53 left in the third quarter with only three free throws to his credit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the coach's decision," Scott said. "I'm not going to lie and say I'm 
pleased by it, but I really don't want to talk about it. It's his decision." 
</P>
<P>
Explained Riley: "Byron was struggling, and Larry (Drew) is more of a 
penetrator. I was trying to get the offense going." 
</P>
<P>
Worthy led the Lakers with 19 points, but made eight of 19 shots and saw his 
inside game reduced to lunges in the lane. Magic Johnson had a triple-double 
with 18 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, but made only six of 16 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Other cold-shooting Lakers were center A.C. Green at three of nine, forward 
Michael Cooper at two of nine, Drew at four of nine and Woolridge at four of 
10. 
</P>
<P>
"No excuses," Riley said. "We just got our . . . beat." 
</P>
<P>
Riley might not have offered excuses, but he and Laker players did offer a few 
reasons for Tuesday's performance. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers are nearing the end of a long trip, and weariness apparently has set 
in. They played their fourth consecutive game without center Mychal Thompson 
(bursitis in his left heel), but they had won one of the previous three games 
with the 6-foot-9 Green starting at center and Cooper at forward. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely out of sync (offensively)," Riley said, "probably because 
we've been on the road for a long time. Being on the road, we haven't had a 
chance to get some really good practices, and everything seemed a step behind." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their poor shooting, the Lakers were not shamed by the loss. The Bulls, 
after all, are 15-7 and lead the Central Division. They are 10-1 at home and 
have a somewhat more-balanced attack. Instead of immediately looking for 
Jordan, the Bulls try a few other options before putting the ball back into his 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
Though pestered by Cooper's defense most of the game, Jordan still showed 
flashes of dominance. He scored 21 of his 37 points in the first half, when he 
made nine of 12 shots. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bulls proved capable of holding a lead even with Jordan temporarily 
grounded. Jordan scored only one field goal and two free throws in the third 
quarter, but the Bulls still outscored the Lakers, 22-16. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, a lot had to do with the Lakers' offensive funk. 
</P>
<P>
"All you can do is fight through it," Green said. "In retrospect, I can't think 
of another game in which this has happened to us. It's frustrating to see it 
happen to everyone. You can't stop shooting. It was unfortunate, but we had to 
just keep grinding it out. Shoot again and again and again and hope maybe they 
will fall." 
</P>
<P>
On this night, it was the Lakers, not their shots, that fell. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan made 15 of 29 shots, but he was more pleased by his defense on 
Magic Johnson. "We were able to contain Magic, and he never really got going," 
Jordan said. "One of our objectives was to slow them down on the break." . . . 
The Lakers' season field-goal percentage fell to 46.4%. Last season, the Lakers 
shot 50.2%. . . Byron Scott's shooting percentage fell to 45.1% and his scoring 
average to 16. Last season, Scott shot 49% and averaged 19.6 points. Michael 
Cooper's shooting percentage dropped to 35.3% Last season, Cooper made 43.1%.

OREGON STATE FALLS, 117-113, TO KIMBLE'S 53

<P>
In a shootout between local favorite Gary Payton and Loyola Marymount's Bo 
Kimble, the Lions beat 21st-ranked Oregon State Tuesday night, 117-113. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 9,183 saw Gill Coliseum -- which began the evening as Payton's Place 
-- end up as Kimble's Corner. 
</P>
<P>
The Beaver All-American fouled out with 48 points. His fifth foul provided 
Kimble with the last of his 53 points and allowed Loyola to build a three-point 
lead in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
Payton's total tied Mel Counts' 26-year-old school record, while Kimble's total 
-- his third in a row of more than 50 -- broke the record for an Oregon State 
opponent of 46 set by Louisiana State's Pete Maravich in 1969. It was also a 
Loyola school record. Kimble hit 21 of 27 shots from the field, 10 of 11 free 
throws and added a game-high 12 rebounds in the absence of Hank Gathers. 
Loyola's total was the most ever scored against Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
In Loyola's first victory over a ranked team since beating Wyoming in the NCAA 
tournament in March, 1988, the Lions overcame several double-figure deficits. 
</P>
<P>
When Payton opened the second-half scoring, the Beavers led, 68-58. But Loyola 
stormed back when Per Stumer hit two three-pointers, and Jeff Fryer connected 
on five more. The Lions, who shot 59% (to Oregon State's 58.5%) hit 10 of 20 
three-point attempts. The Beavers hit only one. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola took its first lead since the opening minute at 71-70 but didn't go 
ahead for good until the 59-second mark, when, with the score tied at 112-112, 
Kimble drove into the lane, drew contact from Payton and sank the shot. Payton 
was called for the foul, and Kimble completed the three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told our guys I was disappointed we didn't get our (scoring) average," 
Lion Coach Paul Westhead quipped. "I knew we were all right when we got down 
12, but two minutes later it was back to four. Once the game gets going like 
that, we're in good shape. Sometimes we give so much you get caught up in the 
run." 
</P>
<P>
Oregon State Coach Jim Anderson agreed. "The system got to us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In improving to 6-1, Loyola got 22 points from Fryer and 18 from Terrell 
Lowery. Four players from Oregon State (5-2) supported Payton with double 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
Among its accomplishments Tuesday, Loyola was able to force 19 turnovers. The 
Beavers were averaging only 12. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't usually brag about our defense, but we were very tough," Westhead 
said. "We played our press very well. It was evident we had tired Oregon State 
in the first half." 
</P>
<P>
The fast-paced first half rapidly became a duel between Payton and Kimble, who 
scored 28 apiece by halftime. Payton paced the Beavers to a 12-point lead 
midway through the period and had 18 points nine minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Then Kimble began working inside, and Loyola trimmed the lead to 52-50 with two 
minutes left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
When Kimble left with three fouls, the Beavers followed with a 10-0 spurt and 
appeared close to burying Loyola before the half. Kimble quickly re-entered the 
game and responded with two consecutive baskets. Then Lowery hit a spinning 
drive at the buzzer to cut the halftime lead to 66-58. 
</P>
<P>
Once the Lions caught up down the stretch, the margin in the final six minutes 
was never more than two points until Kimble's clinching basket. 
</P>
<P>
"The great thing was it wasn't like we just stopped the show and said get the 
ball to Bo," Westhead said. "Eighty-five percent (of his scoring) was in the 
flow." 
</P>
<P>
Said Anderson: "Kimble was an unstoppable force."

A reporter entering the King locker room Tuesday night after the club had 
beaten the Winnipeg Jets, 9-5, could be excused for going back to check the 
team name on the door. 
</P>
<P>
Was this really the winning team? 
</P>
<P>
Hadn't the Kings ended a two-game losing streak with their highest-scoring 
output of the season before 14,158 at the Forum? 
</P>
<P>
Yes to both of the above. 
</P>
<P>
Led by Wayne Gretzky's six points (two goals and four assists) and two goals 
each by Keith Crowder and Steve Duchesne, the third-place Kings had indeed 
increased their advantage to four points over the fourth-place Jets in the 
Smythe Division. 
</P>
<P>
So why all the long faces? 
</P>
<P>
Defense, that's why. Or lack of it. Once again, the Kings had gotten a big 
lead, only to let up. 
</P>
<P>
This time, leading 7-1 after two periods, the Kings gave up four final-period 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fuming," said King Coach Tom Webster, who had already made that obvious. 
"Sure we played well for the first two periods, but they could have gotten back 
into the hockey game. We got lazy. Completely lazy. We got to the point where 
we didn't care what we did on our end of the ice. 
</P>
<P>
"Put it this way: I'm glad we won. There's no way we'll win a championship that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
Crowder's two goals were particularly impressive since he had gone through the 
first 21 games of the season without scoring. A free agent who played for the 
Boston Bruins last season and signed with the Kings during the off-season, 
Crowder scored his first goal as a King two games ago. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, the NHL scoring leader, increased his point total to 73 with his six 
Tuesday night, which tied his single-game high. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' first goal came on a power play, 2:55 into the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, often on the giving end of great passes, was on the receiving end of 
this one. Defenseman Brian Benning faked a shot from the left side, then slid 
the puck past two defenders to Gretzky, who was coming in from the right side. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard enough to stop Gretzky head on, but Winnipeg goalie Daniel Berthiaume 
never had a chance as Benning's fake left him leaning the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky easily flipped the puck in for his 16th goal, his fifth on a power 
play. 
</P>
<P>
The second goal looked a lot like the first. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Tom Laidlaw, back in the lineup after missing four games due to a 
slash over his right eye, set up the second score after stealing the puck. 
</P>
<P>
He passed it to winger John Tonelli who, like Benning, came in from the left 
side, faked the slap shot and then pushed a pass through the slot. 
</P>
<P>
The recipient this time was Crowder, who shoved the puck past Berthiaume's 
glove at 14:44 for his second goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
King left winger Luc Robitaille, who entered play Tuesday night tied with Brett 
Hull of the St. Louis Blues for the league lead in goals with 26, picked up his 
27th at 16:55 off a centering pass from Gretzky to boost the Kings into a 3-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings added four more in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Duchesne scored his 10th at 2:54 of the period on a slap shot off a pass from 
Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
At 13:12, Duchesne got his second goal of the evening and 11th of the season on 
a rising shot that Berthiaume deflected, but couldn't control, the puck getting 
past him. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings added two more goals in a span of 40 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Crowder scored his second of the night on a pass from Tonelli at 16:18. Then, 
the Kings scored again at 16:58. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg's Brent Ashton appeared to be clearing the puck when Berthiaume stuck 
out his stick, stopping the puck in front of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Two Kings were on the spot to respond: Mikko Makela to tap it over to Gretzky, 
who popped it in. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets' only goal in the first two periods came off the stick of center 
Thomas Steen, who scored his 10th goal at 10:32 of the second period. Steen 
later added two assists. 
</P>
<P>
When the final red lights had stopped flashing, goaltender Kelly Hrudey, who 
faced 41 shots, 20 in the final period, was asked why the Kings have become so 
lax on defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. Ask them," he said, pointing to his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
But nobody seemed to have answers this night. 
</P>
<P>
Just a lot of frowns. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg goalie Daniel Berthiaume gave up seven goals on 29 shots in 40 
minutes. Daniel Essensa replaced him in the final period and gave up two goals 
on six shots.

CAL STATE LONG BEACH WOMEN ADD TO TENNESSEE WOES, 62-58

The Cal State Long Beach campus is abuzz with sports news. First, the women's 
volleyball team brought home the NCAA title. Then George Allen was named 
football coach. Anyone hear the latest? 
</P>
<P>
The No. 8-ranked women's basketball team defeated No. 4 Tennessee, 62-58. That 
may not rank with the first two, but don't tell the 1,000-plus that filled 
University Gym, and grew ever raucous as the game progressed. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 58-52, with 1:53 remaining, the 49ers converted two free throws 
before Trise Jackson streaked down court for a layup that made it 58-56. 
</P>
<P>
Penny Moore was fouled and made both free throws to tie the score 58-58 with 
1:08 left. 
</P>
<P>
After a Tennessee timeout, Daedra Charles was called for traveling, and Dana 
Wilkerson got the ball downcourt. She missed, but got her own rebound and 
scored to give the 49ers the lead, 60-58, with 33 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson stole the inbounds pass and passed to Wilkerson, who put the game away. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did the 49ers overcome an eight-point halftime deficit (largely 
because of 20% shooting), they also were outrebounded for the first time this 
year, 57-41. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkerson led four players in double figures with 14 points -- 11 in the second 
half. Center Angelique Lee had 12 points and nine rebounds for the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee (6-3), which has lost to three ranked teams in its last four games, 
got 19 points from center Daedra Charles.

After going on NCAA probation, North Carolina State couldn't get going. 
</P>
<P>
Calvin Talford and Alvin West scored 18 points each and sparked an early 11-0 
run as East Tennessee State upset 15th-ranked N.C. State, 92-82, at Raleigh, 
N.C. It was the Wolfpack's first game since being put on probation last week 
for violations within the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
"I told our team that East Tennessee State is not the kind of team to get 
behind," Wolfpack Coach Jim Valvano said. "If they get ahead, they do run their 
motion offense. When you're playing them with the lead, you can force them to 
do something else. 
</P>
<P>
"They shot the ball exceptionally well. They out-quicked us and they outplayed 
us." 
</P>
<P>
East Tennessee State Coach Les Robinson agreed that his team's quick start was 
the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"We came out of the gate extremely fast tonight and N.C. State didn't," he 
said. "That helped us tremendously with the confidence factor." 
</P>
<P>
The Wolfpack (6-2), coming off an extended layoff for exams, committed 14 
turnovers and shot only 35.7% from the field in the first half as East 
Tennessee State (6-1) took a 17-point halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Talford had five points and West four, including a layup that capped the spurt 
and gave the Buccaneers a 20-6 lead with 13:38 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
East Tennessee State increased the lead to 46-21 on two free throws by Jerry 
Pelphrey, then the Wolfpack scored 10 consecutive points. Bryant Feggins had a 
three-point play and a follow shot and Mickey Hinnant scored on a three-point 
basket and a dunk as the Wolfpack cut the lead to 46-31 with one minute left in 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
No. 1 Syracuse 129, C.W. Post 72 -- Stephen Thompson scored 20 points and Billy 
Owens 18 as the Orangemen tied a Carrier Dome record with a 70-point first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Reserve guard Michael Edwards added all 13 of his points in the opening half, 
when the Orangemen (8-0) matched the 70-point first half they had last season 
against U.S. International. The 129 points were the third most in school 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen made 63 percent of their field-goal attempts, including six of 10 
from three-point range. Willard Mack scored 20 points to lead Division II C.W. 
Post (5-2). 
</P>
<P>
No. 14 Georgia Tech 109, Coastal Carolina 82 -- Dennis Scott scored 33 points 
and Brian Oliver added 27 as the Yellowjackets built a 29-point halftime lead 
and coasted to victory at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The Yellow Jackets (6-0) are off to their best start since 1977-78, when they 
also won their first six. 
</P>
<P>
No. 24 Oklahoma State 79, Texas Southern 77 -- Corey Williams made both ends of 
a one-and-one with six seconds left to give the Cowboys (5-2) the victory at 
Stillwater, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Price, who scored a career-high 34 points, including 15 from 
three-point range, missed a long jump shot on Texas Southern's final chance, 
and a tip-in try also missed at the buzzer. The Tigers fell to 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
No. 22 Arizona 83, Miami, Fla. 53 -- Wayne Womack scored 20 points and had 12 
rebounds as the Wildcats used their inside strength to win at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona (3-2) dominated from the start in handing the Hurricanes (3-2) their 
second consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State 66, Dartmouth 55 -- Isaac Austin scored 24 points and Mark Becker 
had five of his 13 during a 13-2 second-half run as the Sun Devils won at 
Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the fourth in a row for the Sun Devils (4-3). Dartmouth (3-2) 
had its three-game winning streak stopped. 
</P>
<P>
UC Santa Barbara 70, Oregon 54 -- Carrick DeHart scored 22 points and Eric 
McArthur ignited a second-half rally as the Gauchos (5-2) beat the Ducks (5-3) 
at Goleta, Calif.

PEPPERDINE PROVES TOO MUCH FOR IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury has been complaining that his team has played well 
in spurts this season, but not for an entire game. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves fell into that pattern Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine played well just long enough to defeat UC Irvine, 81-71, before 
1,257 at Firestone Fieldhouse in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The game was far from pretty. Both teams kept committing turnovers, and both 
went for long periods without scoring. 
</P>
<P>
And the last three minutes of the game turned into a foul-a-thon, with the 
Anteaters committing most of the fouls in a desperate effort to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves sank 13 of 17 free throws down the stretch to pull out the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Waves looked good at times, Asbury said Irvine's tough zone 
defense had something to do with preventing Pepperdine from running away with 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said that Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan and his players remembered last 
year's 102-76 loss to Pepperdine and were determined that this game wouldn't 
turn into another rout. 
</P>
<P>
"They played a different style and tempo than last year, and they did it very 
well," he said. "We weren't as crisp or as sharp as we wanted to be and may 
have had an emotional letdown after (Saturday's loss to) Kansas. But you've got 
to give Irvine a lot of credit." 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine forward Geoff Lear scored a game-high 25 points, mostly from inside, 
and led all rebounders with 10. Teammate Shann Ferch added 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Herdman, Ricky Butler and Jeff Von Lutzow each scored 14 points for the 
Anteaters, and Herdman added nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine (3-3) took a 24-14 lead with 6:25 left in the half and was ahead at 
halftime, 35-28. 
</P>
<P>
The game began inauspiciously for Irvine (2-6). 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters, who were averaging 17.6 turnovers entering the game, seemed to 
be following the same old pattern of errors. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Waves seemed to be pulling steadily away after building a 10-point 
lead, Irvine got its offense going. Rob Doktorcyzk made a three-point shot, and 
Von Lutzow drove for two layups, sandwiched around a Herdman three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the Anteaters had gotten back in the game, pulling within 27-24. 
</P>
<P>
Lear, operating inside, led the Waves with nine points and five rebounds in the 
first half. He made four of six shots from the field.

JUDGE CURBS TESTIMONY BY NORTH ON POINDEXTER; 
</P>
<P>
IRAN-CONTRA: JURIST SKEPTICALLY ACCEPTS EX-WHITE HOUSE AIDE'S CLAIM OF 
CONFUSION. THE PROSECUTION MAY BE HURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- In a decision that seems certain to handicap the prosecutors of 
Iran-Contra figure John M. Poindexter, a federal judge ruled Tuesday that 
questioning of former White House aide Oliver L. North must be strictly 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
North contended in hearings last week that he was confused about what he knew 
from his own experience and what he concluded based on Poindexter's testimony 
before Congress two years ago -- testimony that cannot be used in Poindexter's 
trial because of immunity conferred by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene said Tuesday that he is skeptical about 
North's claim of confusion about testimony by his ex-boss, Poindexter. However, 
Greene ruled that prosecutors may not ask North any questions relating to 
statements he made after Poindexter began his nationally televised testimony on 
July 15, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter, a former national security adviser in the Ronald Reagan White 
House, is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 22 on five felony charges in the 
Iran-Contra scandal. He is charged with conspiracy, two counts of false 
statements and two counts of obstructing Congress in connection with the Reagan 
Administration's resupply of Nicaraguan rebel forces at a time when Congress 
had banned all military aid to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
Greene's ruling will handicap federal prosecutors because they will be unable 
to use much of the testimony that North gave at his own trial last April, when 
he frequently stated that Poindexter was aware of his support for the Contras. 
North was convicted last May on three of 12 felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
North told Greene last week that he knows Poindexter's immunized testimony 
heavily influenced what he said at his own trial. 
</P>
<P>
Greene's ruling became necessary because Poindexter gave his sworn testimony in 
1987 only after Congress had granted him immunity from criminal prosecution for 
his statements. Thus, the government's prosecution of Poindexter must be based 
solely on evidence obtained by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, without 
reliance on that testimony. Otherwise, a conviction of Poindexter could be 
thrown out on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
North, during two days of hearings before Greene last week, said that he had 
difficulty remembering what he knew from his own experience and what he knew 
from having listened to Poindexter's testimony. North made clear that he 
respects Poindexter and does not relish having to testify at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Greene did note that North testified to Congress several days before Poindexter 
appeared, adding that North's "testimony to these bodies . . . could not have 
been influenced by the statements Poindexter made." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors will be permitted to question North on his congressional testimony 
and to explore subjects on which Poindexter did not testify. 
</P>
<P>
"The court takes North's alleged inability to differentiate with a grain of 
salt," Greene said. "It seems unlikely that a witness who was a major and 
active participant in the events themselves would be unable to distinguish 
between the version of events described in another's testimony and his own 
recollection of what occurred." 
</P>
<P>
However, Greene added that he wants to "err on the side of protecting 
Poindexter's constitutional right not to be convicted with the use of his own 
testimony." 
</P>
<P>
The judge ruled also that the two prosecutors -- Dan Webb, a former U.S. 
attorney in Chicago, and Howard Pearl -- should not be disqualified from trying 
the case. He rejected contentions of Poindexter's lawyers that Webb and Pearl 
are familiar with Poindexter's immunized testimony. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Justice Department attorneys and lawyers for former 
President Reagan filed additional legal papers arguing that Poindexter should 
be prevented from subpoenaing Reagan's personal notes and diaries. Greene 
authorized such a subpoena last month, but it is being contested.

COLD AGAIN BREAKS RECORDS IN MIDWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A stubborn cold spell broke temperature records from Nebraska to the nation's 
capital on Tuesday as wintry storms dumped snow across the Midwest and hit the 
South with sleet and freezing rain. 
</P>
<P>
A fresh batch of record lows gripped parts of Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Ohio and 
the Washington, D.C., area, intensifying what National Weather Service 
officials said is already one of the coldest Decembers on record. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature slipped to a record 19 degrees below zero at Norfolk, Neb., and 
16 below at Grand Island, Neb. Youngstown, Ohio, which had a second straight 
day of record-breaking temperatures, reported a low of 3 below. 
</P>
<P>
Bitter cold gripped northern Wisconsin also on Tuesday, with the low 
temperature plunging to 32 below zero at Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in Harrisburg, Pa., fell to 5 degrees, breaking a record set in 
1919, and the mercury dipped to a record 2 degrees below zero at Dulles 
International Airport outside Washington. It was the fifth straight day for 
record low temperatures there, the weather service reported. 
</P>
<P>
"Looks like the coldest mass is yet to come," meteorologist Jeffrey Stoudt 
said. "There are some indications that the arctic highs might be the last in 
the series . . . but it may take another seven to 10 days for it to run its 
course."

The Department of Housing and Urban Development has an "extremely weak" system 
of policing possible ethics violations by key officials and consultants, 
according to a congressional study released Tuesday. It said that HUD Secretary 
Jack Kemp was partly to blame. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that, to a large extent, it is business as usual at the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development," said Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.), who 
requested and released the General Accounting Office report. "I am faulting 
Secretary Kemp." 
</P>
<P>
Pryor said he believed Kemp, who took office in February, was committed to 
reforming the agency but that it did not appear that all HUD employees were 
following his lead. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp aides acknowledged that problems persist in the agency's internal policing 
efforts but said Kemp and his deputies were making steady improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO, in a draft report to a Senate subcommittee, said it reviewed the files 
of 62 consultants hired by HUD from 1986 to 1989 and that 52 had not filed 
required financial disclosure forms. 
</P>
<P>
The agency, the investigative arm of Congress, said also that HUD had received 
62 disclosure reports from employees who are required to file them but that, 
more than 100 days later, the agency had not reviewed any of them. Ethics law 
requires that the reports, designed to uncover possible conflicts of interest, 
be reviewed within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Francis Keating, HUD's general counsel, said that most of the disclosure 
reports had been reviewed since the GAO had checked in late September. Keating 
said that Kemp ordered Tuesday that the rest be scrutinized by Jan. 15. He 
could not say how many needed to be reviewed.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: LAWYERS, LAWYERS, EVERYWHERE AND NOT A DROP 
OF INK . . .

<P>
At every turn in the Broderick case, there are lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Broderick used to complain that newspapers were afraid to publish 
anything about her bitter divorce for fear of being sued. She was furious when 
her ex-husband, a lawyer, convinced a judge to seal the official record. 
</P>
<P>
After Broderick was charged with murdering her ex-husband and his new wife, 
prosecutors sought a gag order against her and others in the case. 
</P>
<P>
And now the latest legal twist. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Clausen, an award-winning author and creative writing professor at the 
University of San Diego, has decided not to sign with Simon &amp; Schuster to 
write a nonfiction book about the Broderick case. 
</P>
<P>
The major reason: Clausen could not get the assurance he wanted that the 
publishing house would protect him if the book prompted lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Clausen had pitched Simon &amp; Schuster on a "serious, thoughtful" look at the 
Broderick case as "a metaphor for a nation's values and a symbol of much that 
went wrong with human relationships in the 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
Simon &amp; Schuster sent the contracts to the Del Mar-based literary agency 
Waterside Productions. On Sunday, Clausen bowed out. 
</P>
<P>
"I was concerned that the attention to legal details would make me write 
defensively," Clausen said, "and I'd end up with a book with very little 
spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Clausen, 46, won the Edgar Award for mystery fiction in 1982 for his 
best-selling "Ghost Lover," a thinking man's novel of revenge and murder in the 
rural Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
His free-lance writing includes comedy screenplays and a computer software 
manual. He had envisioned telling the Broderick story in the manner of Truman 
Capote's "In Cold Blood," a mix of detailed reporting and novelistic flair. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, he happened to read the latest edition of the book "Fatal Vision." A 
newly added epilogue convinced him he had made the right decision. 
</P>
<P>
It was author Joe McGinniss' account of his three years in court fighting a 
lawsuit filed by convicted murderer Jeffrey MacDonald. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newspaper Strike Chatter 
</P>
<P>
Strike one and you're out. 
</P>
<P>
* Senior editors and non-editorial department managers at the Union-Tribune are 
said to have pleaded with publisher Helen Copley and editor-in-chief Herb Klein 
to avert a threatened strike by Newspaper Guild members. 
</P>
<P>
* Reporters are taking home their files and phone lists so they can't be used 
by replacements hired as strike-breakers. Elected officials are being asked not 
to talk to strike-breakers. 
</P>
<P>
The first to pledge support were Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) and state 
Sen.-elect Lucy Killea (D-San Diego). 
</P>
<P>
* Guild members are handing out flyers warning would-be replacements: "Those 
crossing picket lines to replace us will be deemed SCABS and treated as such." 
</P>
<P>
* As the Guild sees it, the major obstacle to a compromise settlement is the 
disingenuous style of King &amp; Ballow, the Tennessee law firm hired to 
represent the company. 
</P>
<P>
The National Labor Relations Board has accused K&amp;B of two dozen counts of 
illegal negotiating tactics during U-T bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
One U-T employee says the K&amp;B style is captured in William Kennedy's novel 
"The Ink Truck," a comic-tragic tale of a fictional newspaper strike in Albany. 
In it, an angry columnist talks of Stanley, the company's lawyer-negotiator: 
</P>
<P>
"Stanley says our 57th proposal is unacceptable without changes. He refuses to 
specify which changes. Hinted even with changes he wouldn't like it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Odoriferous Idea 
</P>
<P>
Some men have their names on libraries or dams or great halls of learning. 
Others have to settle for less imposing edifices. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dragna, the attorney representing the city in litigation with the 
Environmental Protection Agency, told federal Judge Rudi Brewster during 
Monday's court session that officials are considering names for the proposed 
$2.6-billion sewage system. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been some discussion of naming the system the Judge Brewster 
(sewage) system," Dragna said. 
</P>
<P>
Brewster groaned. Dragna then assured him he was joking.

J. DAVID INVESTORS TO GET 15 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Investors in the bankrupt J. David &amp; Co., founded by since-convicted 
swindler J. David Jerry) Dominelli, will receive about 15 cents for every 
dollar they put into the fraud-riddled brokerage house. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving on Monday authorized the payment of 
$14.7 million to nearly 1,000 J. David creditors, mostly people who invested an 
estimated $83 million in La Jolla-based commodities trading firm. 
</P>
<P>
The payments, expected to be mailed Friday, are the first reimbursements to 
investors since the company collapsed into involuntary bankruptcy in February, 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the largest lump-sum payment investors can expect, although there 
may be future distributions of much smaller amounts, bankruptcy trustee Allan 
M. Frostrom said. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be the bulk of the money," he said. "There will be at least one more 
distribution, but I can't say with optimism that it will approach anything more 
than 5 cents" per dollar invested. 
</P>
<P>
About $6 million has been paid by the J. David estate through the trustee for 
adminstration of the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
That money and the amount being returned to investors come from funds 
authorities recovered by selling J. David property, settlements of preferential 
payment lawsuits and interest earned on those funds, Frostrom said. 
</P>
<P>
After disgruntled investors forced the closure of Dominelli's financial empire, 
investigators found only $350,000 of what investors thought would total more 
than $83 million, Frostrom said. 
</P>
<P>
Dominelli is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence for his guilty plea to 
mail fraud, bankruptcy fraud and tax evasion. He ran a sophisticated Ponzi 
scheme, in which money from new investors was used to pay previous investors 
and finance his lavish life style. 
</P>
<P>
Former J. David executive Nancy Hoover Hunter, then Dominelli's girlfriend, 
also was convicted by a federal jury last week of four counts of tax evasion in 
connection with the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, who has since married Santa Barbara millionaire businessman Kenneth 
Hunter, remains jailed without bond pending her scheduled sentencing Feb. 20, 
the same day her retrial is scheduled to begin on 192 unresolved conspiracy and 
fraud charges.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ATTORNEY TO PAY COUNTY $25,511 FOR 
OVERBILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles attorney who was accused of overbilling for legal services he 
performed on behalf of indigent defendants has agreed to pay the county 
$25,511, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
W. Raymond Newman, who , in 1988, was the highest paid court-appointed attorney 
in a county bar program, reached the out-of-court settlement last week with the 
district attorney's office. He had been paid $508,000 in 1988 by the Los 
Angeles Superior Court for representing indigents, and had allegedly billed for 
work performed on 366 days of the year, officials said. Records indicated that 
he had billed for 5,000 hours of work, far in excess of the annual average of 
2,000 billable hours normally claimed by civil law firms. 
</P>
<P>
Newman was suspended last month from the county's bar's Indigent Crimminal 
Defense Appointment program, a panel of court-sanctioned attorneys who provide 
services to clients when the public defender's office is unavailable.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Zoo has received one of the largest single donations in its 
history, an unexpected $1.1 million gift from the estate of two La Jolla 
retirees that has been earmarked for gorilla exhibits now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
John and Opal McDonald, a 92-year-old retired executive from Caterpillar 
Tractor Co. of Peoria, Ill, and his 85-year-old wife, had been members of the 
San Diego Zoological Society for 15 years, but had never indicated their plans 
to make the zoo a beneficiary of their estate, said Patrick O'Reiley, the zoo's 
planned-giving director. 
</P>
<P>
The gift, which zoo officials say puts them over the halfway mark in its 
$16-million fund-raising drive for the gorilla exhibit, is among the zoo's 
largest ever. In 1986, Joan Kroc gave $3.3 million for the zoo's Tiger River 
exhibit. In 1987 and 1988, Paul and Ione Harter of Coronado created a 
$1.75-million trust for the zoo, then deeded over their $3-million residence as 
well.

GINGER BROWN'S FATHER, ACCUSED OF KIDNAPING, CALLS IT A 'RESCUE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Testifying on his own behalf, Earle Brown told a Vista Superior Court jury 
Tuesday that he and his wife, Dorothy, decided to "rescue" their daughter, 
Ginger Brown, from the influence of the leader of a religious group in order 
"to save her, to return her to a free state of mind." 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to restore Ginger to her free will and to get her to act responsibly 
in society," Earle Brown, 58, said of the unsuccessful, five-day deprogramming 
effort in May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he and his wife decided to forcibly take their daughter after she 
had been home in the fall of 1987 for a supposed reconciliation but was still 
anti-social. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety percent of the time she was there, she wouldn't talk with us," he said. 
"She took no meals with us, wouldn't watch TV with us, wouldn't go to shows 
with us. I was confused. 
</P>
<P>
"On Thanksgiving Day, she wouldn't eat with us. She left the house early that 
morning and didn't come home until late at night." 
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after that to try to remove her from the small religious 
group known as Great Among the Nations, Brown said. But, on the fifth day of 
the deprogramming effort, Brown said, he and his wife gave up and decided to 
return Ginger Brown to her apartment in Carlsbad. Instead, he said, she tricked 
them into taking her to the Sheriff's Department substation in Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a quick U-turn," he said. "I wanted to get her back safely to her 
apartment. "She started banging her head -- bang! bang! -- on the motor cover 
(of the van). I said, 'Dorothy, we've got to let her go.' I'd rather have her 
off, out in the night, than hurting her head." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he pulled over and his daughter jumped out of the van. He and his 
wife then returned to the sheriff's substation, where they asked for help in 
finding her and were, in turn, arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns, another of their daughters, Holly, and two men -- Hank Erler, in 
whose mother's Escondido home the deprogramming attempt was made, and Cliff 
Daniels, the deprogrammer -- are standing trial for kidnaping, false 
imprisonment and battery. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys believe the Browns are the first parents to stand trial in this 
country on kidnaping charges stemming from a deprogramming attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Earle Brown said that, although his daughter was kicking and swinging her arms 
when she was taken from an Encinitas parking lot, efforts were made not to hurt 
her. Contrary to his daughter's testimony that she was punched in the face and 
lifed into the getaway van, Brown said, he and an accomplice simply lifted her 
into the van, where a mattress had been placed on the floor so she wouldn't be 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he struck his daughter, Brown said: "She was biting into my shoulder. 
I couldn't believe this was happening. I swiftly pushed her face away because 
the pain was unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Again contradicting his daughter's testimony, Brown said her head was never 
rammed against the van's floor. "She'd go into these kicking attacks. I'd say, 
'Please, be still, please be quiet, we want to talk. Calm down, calm down." 
</P>
<P>
Brown conceded he told his daughter he might break her leg, but he said he was 
joking out of nervous tension. "I said that in jest to her. I thought it would 
elicit some joke or ha ha from her. I was in shock, and she was in shock." 
</P>
<P>
While inside the home in Escondido, Brown said, his daughter at one time 
"hammered her forearm against the wall real hard, as if to bruise it." Another 
time, he said, Ginger Brown was "picking scabs" from an earlier wound. 
</P>
<P>
"No one at any time attempted for Ginger to renounce her faith," he said. 
Rather, the group was trying to get her to disavow her allegiance to Benjamin 
Altschul, the leader of Great Among the Nations to which his daughter belonged. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Rempel said after Brown's testimony, "Nothing he said 
hurt us, except that he's her father. But, as far as the law goes, he hasn't 
said a thing that constitutes a defense to kidnaping." 
</P>
<P>
During a break in Tuesday's proceedings, Rempel asked Judge David B. Moon Jr. 
to admonish persons in the courtroom for supposedly applauding rulings that 
went in the defense's favor and for crying in view of the jury to evoke 
sympathy on behalf of the Brown parents. 
</P>
<P>
Rempel's remarks were apparently in reference to television actress Maureen 
McCormick ("The Brady Bunch") who, along with another trial watcher, television 
character actor Bob Pierce, said she was present in support of the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by Moon if he had seen applauding or crying, courtroom bailiff Elmer 
Blaikie said, "I've seen a lot of people crying, but I haven't seen anybody 
clapping, your honor." 
</P>
<P>
Rempel's cross-examination of Earle Brown continues today. Holly and Dorothy 
Brown are expected to testify on their own behalf Wednesday and Thursday, but 
the case isn't expected to go to the jury for deliberations until the first 
week of January.

D.A. TO SEEK LIFE IN PRISON FOR RUSS IN 1987 KILLING OF HIS ARTIST WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former fugitive Charles Russ faces a life sentence without the possibility of 
parole if he is convicted of killing his artist wife by running over her with 
her own car, the San Diego County district attorney's office said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Pettine said the death penalty had been ruled out. 
Pettine said "a total review of the case" resulted in the determination that 
life without parole would be "appropriate punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Russ, 39, formerly of Leucadia, entered a not-guilty plea to the murder charge 
Tuesday, and San Diego Superior Court Judge Herbert Exarhos set trial for June 
13. 
</P>
<P>
Russ' wife, Pamela, 33, was found on North Torrey Pines Road near La Jolla on 
Feb. 1, 1987. Her Mercedes-Benz was found nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Russ is also charged with two counts of forgery and two counts of grand theft 
in the alleged embezzlement of $78,000, the life savings of his mother-in-law, 
Ginger Allen, 68. 
</P>
<P>
Pettine said the special-circumstances allegations stated that Pamela Russ was 
killed for financial gain and that she was a witness to the bilking of her 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
Exarhos revoked a $3-million bail set for Russ because of the filing of the 
special-circumstances allegations. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney substituting for Russ' regular attorney objected, and the judge 
scheduled a bail review for Dec. 27. He will be held without bail until then. 
</P>
<P>
Pettine said that Russ was a fugitive for two years, until his arrest in 
Florida in August, and was thus a flight risk. 
</P>
<P>
Russ was arrested after the case was featured on "America's Most Wanted" 
television show. He was recognized by a North Hollywood, Fla., detective who 
was walking on a beach.

MISSING GIRL, 2, IS FOUND IN SOUTHEAST S.D. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty-one CB-wielding citizens and 15 San Diego police officers helped find a 
2 1/2-year-old girl Tuesday after searching a 3-square-mile area. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe that Christian Smith, who was staying with her aunt, crawled out 
of the house sometime between 11 p.m. Monday and 8 a.m. Tuesday and walked 
toward her mother's house half a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
The citizens band radio group, called the CB Emergency Response Team, narrowed 
the search Tuesday morning. But it was the girl's 15-year-old sister who 
spotted Christian being dragged by a man behind a fast-food restaurant on 54th 
Street about 12:30 p.m., a mile and a half from where she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
The sister, Damisi Matlock, was in a parking lot across the street after having 
her hair done when she saw Christian. 
</P>
<P>
When spotted, the man dropped the child and fled. He was described as white, 
about 30 years old, 5 feet, 9 inches tall, 145 pounds with long brown hair, and 
wearing cutoff shorts and a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Police do not know when the man met up with Christian, but she did not appear 
to be injured. 
</P>
<P>
The CB team canvassed the neighborhood of the aunt's house, going door to door 
and circulating photocopies of the girl's picture. The effort turned up a 
witness who had seen the girl, leading the search in the direction where she 
was eventually found. 
</P>
<P>
"They were able to expand our search resources," Sgt. David Berridge said of 
the CB team. "They found the witnesses, but the family members were the ones 
that found the child." 
</P>
<P>
The CB organization has helped in about half a dozen searches for missing 
children and invalid adults in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is that we can saturate a search area with lots of people at no cost 
to the city," said R. H. Westray of the CB organization.

HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: DE LA HOYA CREATES A NAME FOR HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Rene de la Hoya stands 6-foot-2. And he weighs 140 pounds. Which makes you 
wonder if he has eaten anything resembling a meal in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
How does one describe de la Hoya's physique? 
</P>
<P>
"He looks like a pencil," Reseda Coach Jeff Halpern said. 
</P>
<P>
De la Hoya is that guy you play against on the blacktop who is so rail thin 
that it feels as if his elbows have been chiseled to an annoyingly sharp tip. 
</P>
<P>
Meet Rene de la Hoya, most valuable player of the North Hollywood tournament 
and a senior starting forward for Grant (8-1), the No.1-ranked team in the 
Times Valley poll. Grant, behind the fine play of de la Hoya, dumped previously 
top-ranked North Hollywood on Saturday night in the title game, 54-43. That's 
the same Husky team that features all-everything Dana Jones, a player who is so 
talented that it's likely the tournament folks had his name engraved on the MVP 
trophy sometime last summer. 
</P>
<P>
De la Hoya paid careful attention to Jones, making sure that all of his 
team-high 13 points avoided a Jones handprint. 
</P>
<P>
"When I drove in against him, I just dished it off," the quiet de la Hoya said 
respectfully. 
</P>
<P>
But Jones and the rest of the capacity crowd at North Hollywood's gym were 
forced to pay attention to de la Hoya when the thin man was making an emphatic 
statement with two breakaway dunks. 
</P>
<P>
The first came with 3:52 left in the second quarter and gave Grant an 18-14 
lead. The second came with 3:05 left in the third quarter and gave his team a 
29-23 lead, making it seem plausible that Grant could beat the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at the game," Halpern said. "And those dunks just about made my 
assistant's jaw fall open." 
</P>
<P>
De la Hoya's reaction? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I was waiting for that," he said. "I'd never dunked in a game before but 
I knew I could get over the rim, so I did it." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, de la Hoya scored 11 points in the opening tournament game against 
Bell-Jeff and a game-high 23 points in a semifinal win over Reseda. Not bad for 
a guy who played his first game of organized basketball just last year. 
</P>
<P>
De la Hoya shied away from the sport even though he competed against his 
brother Javier, a former Grant baseball star now in the Dodger organization, on 
the playground. It took the encouragement of Bill McKee, a former Grant varsity 
coach and current physical education teacher to induce him to try out for the 
team as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
De la Hoya -- who insists that the correct spelling of his surname is as such 
and not the single-word spelling his brother uses -- played on the 'B' team his 
junior season and was chosen league player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
He has come a long way. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he didn't even attend Grant games. Now he is chosen tournament 
MVP over a player such as Jones, who already has signed with Pepperdine. "It 
surprised me," he said of the selection. "I thought Dana was gonna get it for 
sure. But then my whole team was mobbing me, and my brother, Javier, was in the 
stands jumping for me, he was so happy." 
</P>
<P>
As Halpern said: "Coming out of the shadow of his brother." 
</P>
<P>
For a lean sort, Rene is casting a rather big shadow himself.

HARBOUR (50), MYERS (45) SET SCHOOL SCORING RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
John Harbour, the Camarillo High basketball coach, believes that his 6-foot-2 
1/2 son, David, needs to grow a little to attract basketball scholarship offers 
from big-time Division I schools. 
</P>
<P>
"He's pretty serious about playing basketball in college," the elder Harbour 
said. "But he might need that extra inch." 
</P>
<P>
Yet even if David, a junior guard, doesn't grow another millimeter, he might 
have found the best way to grab the attention of college recruiters -- by 
posting some very big numbers. 
</P>
<P>
In a first-round game of the Bosco Tech tournament Tuesday, Harbour scored a 
school-record 50 points to lead Camarillo to a 78-56 win over Garfield at Bosco 
Tech in Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
In another game involving a Marmonte League team, Royal forward Russell Myers 
scored a school-record 45 points to lead the Highlanders to a 90-68 victory 
over Buena at Royal. Myers, a 6-6 forward, is recovering from mononucleosis. 
</P>
<P>
Myers, who missed five games before returning in last Saturday's 65-46 victory 
over Notre Dame, broke the school scoring record of 40 set by Andy Jercha in 
1981. Myers came off the bench against both Notre Dame and Buena. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was feeling tired, I was supposed to let (Coach Joe Malkinson) know," 
Myers said in reference to the Buena game. "But I didn't feel that bad, so I 
played almost the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
Myers made 13 of 17 free throws, a pair of three-pointers and 13 two-point 
field goals against Buena. 
</P>
<P>
In Camarillo's victory, Harbour scored 36 of his team's 45 points in the first 
half, made 16 of 28 shots from the field and 14 of 16 free throws. Harbour 
broke the Camarillo single-game mark of 42 set in 1985-86 by Mitch Parrott and 
came within a basket of tying the Ventura County record of 52, held by Don 
MacLean of Simi Valley and Jeff Oliver of Buena. 
</P>
<P>
A factor in Harbour's extensive playing time was the loss of fellow starters 
Rick Schnell and Scott Foster. 
</P>
<P>
Schnell, a returning starter who was averaging 16.6 points a game this season, 
underwent emergency appendectomy surgery Tuesday and will be out from two to 
four weeks, Harbour said. Schnell was an all-tournament selection last week as 
Camarillo won the Page (Ariz.) tournament championship. 
</P>
<P>
Foster, a three-year starter at center, was diagnosed Monday as having 
mononucleosis and will be out from two to six weeks. STEVE ELLING

MASTER'S SHOWCASES GREER IN 74-53 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As debuts go, it was far from spectacular, but neither Damon Greer, nor 
Master's College Coach Mel Hankinson, nor anyone in the estimated crowd of 650 
at Bross Gymnasium was complaining after the Master's 74-53 victory over Cal 
Baptist in a National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 men's 
basketball game Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Greer, one of 10 players who quit San Jose State's team in January protesting 
what he called then-Coach Bob Berry's verbal abuse and mental cruelty, had six 
points, four assists and three rebounds in his first collegiate game in more 
than 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just glad to be back out there," Greer said. "I had the butterflies as 
usual, but my main concern was to just help the team and not make too many 
mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
While it was obvious that Greer will need several more games to be totally 
comfortable on the floor again, the former Cleveland High standout did show 
flashes of brilliance that left the crowd oohing and aahing. 
</P>
<P>
On two occasions in the second half, Greer fed teammate Tom Bruner (18 points) 
with passes on fast breaks that resulted in a two-hand jam and a layup. Later, 
the 6-foot guard went above the rim to tip in a missed layup by David 
Humphreys. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly feel good about his first night out," Hankinson said. "The 
addition of him and Humphreys make us a very strong team at the point-guard 
position . . . That's a very excited locker room in there right now. Those guys 
are talking about winning 10 games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"Damon adds a whole new dimension to our team. With his athletic ability, he 
has the capability of scoring or setting up a basket at any moment. His 
addition makes us one of the strongest college division teams in this region."

Steve Carnes and Mike Wawryk each scored 20 points as Simi Valley High nursed 
an early lead Tuesday to defeat Crescenta Valley, 52-45, in a nonleague game at 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by as many as 12 points in the first half, the Falcons (6-2) chipped 
away at Simi Valley -- even getting within a point in the third quarter -- but 
were unable to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed a 'W' against a good team," said Pioneer Coach Dean Bradshaw, whose 
team improved its record to 5-4. "Are we oiled up and ready to go? No." 
</P>
<P>
Nor is Crescenta Valley, as evidenced by poor free-throw shooting. The Falcons 
made just nine of 20 attempts. Simi Valley missed 11 of its 23 foul shots. 
</P>

<P>
De la Hoya made six of six free throws in the fourth quarter -- including two 
with 25 seconds left to send the game into overtime -- and May scored six 
points in the extra period. Grant (8-1) made 17 of 18 free throws.

MARJORIE LORD VOLK MAKES ROOM FOR BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1976, actress Marjorie Lord Volk was wondering what she would do with her 
life after marrying Harry Volk, the banker who helped finance the Music Center 
and who is now chairman of the Weingart Foundation, which gives away millions 
of dollars to Skid Row causes and the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought -- you work, you earn money, you prove yourself," she said. 
Immediately after her marriage, however, she found herself in demand, mostly 
because of her husband's reputation, she thinks. "I did not have the respect 
then that I do now for people who volunteer -- giving their time, their money 
and their creativity. But I've met some wonderful friends. You know, the acting 
world is very insular, and this (her marriage) has opened up new worlds that I 
would not have sought after; I knew they were there, but I did not know they 
were there for me." 
</P>
<P>
This week, the actress, best known for the role of Kathy, the wife of Danny 
Thomas in "Make Room for Daddy," will star as volunteer chairman of the Joffrey 
Ballet's Patron Nights. The first one tonight celebrates the opening of the 
Joffrey Ballet LA/NY winter season with "The Nutcracker" at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion. Volk will also chair the Patron Series opening night of the 
spring season May 2 with a black-tie dinner-dance in the Grand Hall and the May 
20 picnic supper with Gerald Arpino and the Joffrey Dancers preceding "Romeo 
and Juliet." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's Patron parties netted about $300,000. Volk hopes for as much, from 
underwriters and from the patrons who will pay $1,000 each for the series. To 
help her, she recruited Ruth Shannon, Peggy Parker and Lara Ladd for 
assistants. "It takes a lot of thought and effort," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, the ballet is a labor of love. . . . In the world today, we are all so 
busy feeding the poor and the hungry and sick, but we have to nourish their 
souls with the arts and give them something to look forward to in life." 
Through the financial support of Gary Winnick, she notes, the entire Pavilion 
will be opened for a matinee next Wednesday for the underprivileged. 
</P>
<P>
Volk also has made her mark in the city as chairman of a recent benefit for the 
Friends of the USC Library and as a volunteer for Banning House's Floriade. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't enough hours in the day," she said. She's also co-writing a 
script. Two years ago she did a TV film and a TV pilot. She also is following 
the acting career of her daughter Anne Archer, who has completed two new films 
and was nominated for an Oscar for her supporting role in "Fatal Attraction." 
Says Volk: "She's a hard worker, and she was exposed to it through me." 
</P>
<P>
Born and raised in San Francisco, Volk studied dance and acting from the age of 
3. When she was 16, her family moved to New York, and she played the lead 
ingenue on Broadway for four months in "The Old Maid" with Judith Anderson. She 
then toured 10 months. She was married to Broadway actor John Archer for nine 
years before they divorced and then 17 years to Randy Hale, an actor and son of 
the prominent San Francisco retailing family. 
</P>
<P>
As a widow, she met Harry Volk, a widower. Leaving the acting world, she says, 
"is a little painful, because it is all I wanted and I struggled for, and I 
never thought I would pull out of acting. But I wouldn't want to be struggling 
as an older actress. I would rather retire graciously."

ABT CANCELS L.A. DATES; FROZEN OUT BY JOFFREY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
American Ballet Theatre will not dance in Los Angeles in 1990, said Jane 
Herman, executive director of the company. However, the company remains 
scheduled to appear from March 6 to 18 at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The company had announced plans to dance at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for 
two weeks in July, nine years after its last engagement there. 
</P>
<P>
Ballet Theatre's decision came after the collapse of negotiations with the 
Music Center Operating Co. to bring the company back to the Pavilion for annual 
engagements from 1990-92, sources said. But whether Ballet Theatre canceled or 
the Music Center withdrew an offer remained open to debate. 
</P>
<P>
Herman said that the Music Center Operating Co. "withdrew an offer (for annual 
Ballet Theatre engagements) that was on the table and approved by the officers 
of ABT," and she blames that withdrawal on the Joffrey Ballet, the resident 
dance company of the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told not to fly out to sign the three-year agreement -- because I 
couldn't have it," Herman said. "I was told in no uncertain terms that we could 
not play two consecutive years (at the Pavilion) -- and this was a decision by 
the Joffrey." She agreed that the initial proposal for annual ABT appearances 
at the Pavilion was made by ABT, before she joined the company in September. 
</P>
<P>
"For a company of our size to go into July, unassisted by anyone -- to be 
completely at risk, and yet have no ability to build a subscription audience 
(at the Pavilion, over a minimum three-year-period) -- was unacceptable," she 
said. "We would have had no jurisdiction over our future." 
</P>
<P>
Penelope Curry, executive director of the Joffrey Ballet, denied that her 
company had any veto power over Music Center bookings. "That's strictly the 
(Music Center) Operating Co.," she said. The operating company's executives 
agreed and said that the Joffrey's role was strictly advisory. 
</P>
<P>
However, Curry also said that the operating company had asked the Joffrey for 
its opinion of the three-year Ballet Theatre proposal, and "we recommended 
against it" on principle. 
</P>
<P>
She explained that only the Music Center resident companies (which include, at 
the Pavilion, the Joffrey Ballet, the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Los Angeles 
Master Chorale and Music Center Opera) are guaranteed annual performance dates. 
"Having as little as three weeks more available (for dance at the heavily 
booked Pavilion) up until Disney Hall opens, we wouldn't want L.A. closed out 
to everyone except one or two companies," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our feeling that there should be a variety of dance at the Music Center. 
Beginning in 1992, the Joffrey has been asked to coordinate dance at the Music 
Center, and we wanted ABT to be the first company to be invited (for a proposed 
subscription dance season)." 
</P>
<P>
That invitation, made this July, was for appearances every other year, Curry 
said, "but Jane (Herman) said that until she had finalized negotiations with 
the operating company (over the three-year proposal), she didn't want to talk 
about 1992." Herman agreed with Curry's account of the 1992 situation. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Kimberling, president of the Music Center Operating Co., confirmed the 
Joffrey's influence on the decision to reject Ballet Theatre's three-year 
proposal. "We chose to pursue musical theater for '91 (instead of offering the 
time to Ballet Theatre) and support the Joffrey Ballet in our decision, she 
explained." 
</P>
<P>
However, Kimberling said the operating company "had made Jane a very fair deal 
for 1990. But she considered 1990 only as the first step in an annual 
commitment. . . . It was definitely a permanent arrangement (one that would 
last beyond the three-year proposal) that ABT wanted as far as I'm concerned." 
</P>
<P>
A gala celebrating the company's 50th anniversary was to have been part of the 
1990 engagement. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie E. Schoof, Ballet Theatre general manager, was in charge of negotiations 
with the Music Center before Herman joined the company. He said that in 
discussions and preliminary negotiations -- "all along" -- the Operating Co. 
always accepted the premise that ABT would be coming each year on a 
self-presentation basis. "They spoke about offering us a one-year contract, 
renewable annually," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Schneider, chairman and chief executive officer of the operating company, 
explained that, since the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera ceased to be a Music 
Center resident company, "the one thing we don't have on a regular basis is 
musical theater." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the possibility of "The Phantom of the Opera" continuing to play 
the Ahmanson through the summer of 1991 helped shape the decision to put 
musical theater in the Pavilion that summer rather than Ballet Theatre. But he 
emphasized that "we'd love to have ABT there -- and we'd love to have other 
dance companies there as well." 
</P>
<P>
The Music Center is not yet prepared to announce what attraction will fill the 
dates previously assigned to Ballet Theatre -- but operating company executives 
said there is no shortage of applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Curry said the Joffrey had never objected to plans for an ABT season at the 
Pavilion in July, 1990, and, indeed, had agreed to a request from the operating 
company to help market that season through flyers inserted into Joffrey 
programs. But she also said that the ABT cancellation involved causes other 
than the problem of the Pavilion's long-term availability. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my understanding that the main concern that ABT had for 1990 was the 
risk of playing against the Bolshoi (Ballet) at the Shrine," she said. (Half of 
Ballet Theatre's two-week engagement at the Pavilion would have overlapped the 
Bolshoi season.) 
</P>
<P>
Curry agreed that unconfirmed reports of engagements in Orange County by the 
Royal Ballet (in late July and early August) and the Australian Ballet from 
(Aug. 7 to 12) -- plus the attention to be given the dance-dominated 1990 Los 
Angeles Festival in September -- also made for what she called "a very risky 
summer." 
</P>
<P>
Kimberling also said that the Bolshoi engagement was a key factor in Ballet 
Theatre's decision not to dance in Los Angeles. "If the Bolshoi hadn't been 
there, ABT would have taken its chances," she declared. "I told Jane that if it 
was my decision, I wouldn't come." 
</P>
<P>
Schneider was even more emphatic. "There's just no doubt in my mind that the 
direct competition with the Bolshoi, and ABT's own appearance in Orange County 
in the spring caused them to cancel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Herman denied that the issue of Bolshoi competition was pivotal, though she 
also said that she didn't know which dates the Bolshoi would play in Los 
Angeles when she joined the company and picked up the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying that the Bolshoi being there didn't cause us to worry about the 
rep we were bringing," she said. "It certainly changed some of our (box-office) 
projections, too. But the major problem was that the idea of an ABT presence 
annually (at the Pavilion) was not what they (the Joffrey) saw to their 
advantage. They wanted us every other year and to bring in other companies in 
the interim years. All of which would be attached to their subscriptions." 
</P>
<P>
"(We) cannot afford high-risk factors in the summer if we can't build (our own) 
subscription audiences," she said. "We can't allow our company to be part of a 
major financial risk in order to bolster subscriptions in which we have no 
say." 
</P>
<P>
She said the July, 1990, dates were not connected to any other nearby 
engagements -- what's called a "runout." 
</P>
<P>
"A completely segregated engagement like this one is extremely costly," she 
explained. "We're talking about 140 people, 10 or 12 trucks out on tour. We 
were prepared to do it as an investment, to build a (subscription) audience at 
the Pavilion and in hopes of securing more attractive dates when the Disney 
Hall opens (in 1992). But not as a one-year-deal with absolutely no knowledge 
of where that would take us." 
</P>
<P>
Herman said she wasn't sure whether Ballet Theatre would dance in Los Angeles 
in 1991, and wanted to look at plans for that year "completely fresh." 
</P>
<P>
As for the invitation to join the Pavilion's subscription dance season the 
following year, she characterized herself as adaptable. "If we have to 
negotiate with the Joffrey for '92," she said, "we will see what the future 
is."

DAMAGE CONTROL AT THE BELEAGUERED CORCORAN GALLERY OF ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that Christina Orr-Cahall has taken the fall for the outlandish shenanigans 
of Washington's Corcoran Gallery of Art during the past six months, observers 
immediately have begun to ask: Who will replace her as director of the 
once-venerable, now-sullied, museum? 
</P>
<P>
Alas, we ought to be asking something slightly different: Who in their right 
mind would want to? 
</P>
<P>
Let me explain. 
</P>
<P>
The Corcoran's problems are far from over. Following months of national 
protests, artists' boycotts, staff defections, patron withdrawals and more, all 
in the crippling wake of the cancellation of a long-planned exhibition of 
photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe, the announcement Monday that the 
director would relinquish her post at the helm of the museum is news to be 
received with both a yawn and a groan. 
</P>
<P>
The yawn comes from recognizing that, when Orr-Cahall decided, on June 13, to 
cancel a potentially controversial show for fear of upsetting Congress on the 
eve of budget hearings for the National Endowment for the Arts, she set into 
motion a great, whirring machine of righteous (and appropriate) horror that 
could only be shut off by insightful and decisive action. 
</P>
<P>
Simply put, the cancellation was shocking because it placed the security of 
federal arts funding ahead of the very ends of art itself. It was difficult to 
believe that a museum professional who did not understand the gravity of that 
decision -- indeed, who didn't even seem to know that was its consequence -- 
could possibly possess the skill to pull out of a screaming nosedive. She 
didn't, and Monday she crashed and burned. 
</P>
<P>
The groan comes from something else. We are not talking here about the 
momentary failure of judgment on the part of a single museum employee, which 
can be neatly swept away with her departure. We are not even talking about a 
director's repeated failures. After all, the cancellation of the Mapplethorpe 
exhibition was accomplished with the official backing and continued support of 
the Corcoran's board of trustees. There was virtually no indication Monday, as 
there has not been from Day One, that the museum board has in any way changed 
its mind about that calamitous decision. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, board chairman David Lloyd Kreeger, a member of a special trustees' 
committee appointed Sept. 25 to find ways to repair the damage to the museum's 
credibility, was quoted in published reports of Monday's announcement as saying 
that the board was less concerned about the cancellation of the Mapplethorpe 
show than about the "continued barrage" of criticism leveled at the Corcoran. 
(Kreeger was subsequently unavailable for comment.) Amazingly enough, six 
months later the crisis still is being perceived as a gross public relations 
problem, an ever more nagging menace that might miraculously disappear with the 
director. 
</P>
<P>
It won't. Public life is forever being confused with public relations, but the 
Corcoran scandal is at heart a catastrophe of public life. For it is finally 
the board of trustees, not the director, that holds the museum, its collections 
and its programs in trust for the public. It is the board of trustees, not its 
employee, in whom ultimate fiduciary responsibility is vested. That is what the 
word trustee means. Except for a staff change, the Corcoran Gallery of Art 
today is no different than it was last week, when public confidence and support 
were virtually nil. 
</P>
<P>
So, what is the museum to do to begin earnestly repairing the damage it has 
wrought? Indications are that, in a report approved in principle and to be 
publicly released next month, the special trustee committee has recommended a 
structural overhaul of the museum's unwieldy board. It's a crucial decision. 
Indeed, a newly configured, less divisive board might now actually take the 
step it should have taken -- and almost did -- many months ago. The Corcoran 
might apologize to the public whose confidence it has breached, and whose trust 
has been seriously violated. 
</P>
<P>
In September, a few days before the trustees' special damage-control committee 
was assembled, the board and the director did issue a joint statement, which 
was billed as a public apology. When it turned out not to be, the supposed mea 
culpa immediately blew up in their faces. 
</P>
<P>
For what did the Corcoran apologize? Certainly not for having erred in 
rearranging its exhibition program according to a perception of the political 
winds blowing through the corridors of Congress. No, the Corcoran humbly 
apologized for having created a public relations nightmare for itself. "By 
withdrawing from the Mapplethorpe exhibition," the statement said, "we, the 
board of trustees and the director, have inadvertantly offended many members of 
the arts community, which we deeply regret." 
</P>
<P>
Apology not accepted, because apology not offered. If the Corcoran wants to 
appear strong, thus restoring at least a modicum of public confidence, then the 
Corcoran has got to be strong. 
</P>
<P>
A formal apology is not necessary because of any vulgar need to embarass 
anyone, nor to force an admission of guilt on bended knee. A formal apology is 
necessary simply because the public needs to know that the museum truly knows 
what happened. So far, there is still no indication of that, and Monday's 
musical chairs didn't help. 
</P>
<P>
Handicapping the potential replacements for the directorship of the Corcoran 
Gallery of Art is not the appropriate line of inquiry now, because this is not 
a business-as-usual situation. As it stands, it's hard to imagine a candidate 
worth his or her salt even considering the post -- which is not the same as 
saying that someone might not get the job.

ONCE CREAM OF CROP, JACK BRUCE RETURNS TO ROCK WARS; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: VETERAN BASS PLAYER WANTS TO 'RECAPTURE THE FEELING' OF PLAYING TO 
LIVE AUDIENCES. HE LEADS HIS NEW BAND, INTO THE COACH HOUSE TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"When it came to getting along together, they might have called us Sour Cream," 
quipped bassist Jack Bruce, referring to his stormy 2 1/2 years with drummer 
Ginger Baker and guitarist Eric Clapton in the late-'60s rock super-group 
Cream. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in an elegant Beverly Hills office, Bruce, a small man wearing rumpled 
clothes and flashing a beaming smile that never seemed to quit, continued: "We 
did a lot of things wrong when it came to getting along. In many ways, it was 
like a bad marriage. We were young and foolish. But there were high points. We 
did make some good music." 
</P>
<P>
He was just being modest. Cream made some great music. 
</P>
<P>
Fans still recall Bruce, 46, from his glory days. That's why there's such 
interest in his new band, which plays tonight at the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano and Thursday at the Palace. 
</P>
<P>
These dates are part of a tour promoting Bruce's Epic album, "A Question of 
Time" -- his first American solo album and tour since 1981. The band also 
includes Baker, who has been both Bruce's friend and nemesis over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've patched up our differences," said Bruce. "We can play together now. But 
we used to have some terrible times. Lord knows Ginger can be difficult. But 
can you believe that I can be difficult too?" 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it's hard to imagine this hearty, outgoing Scotsman being 
temperamental. But he reiterated: "I have my bad moments if people push the 
wrong buttons. Ginger and Eric used to push the wrong buttons sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Cream, with its blues-influenced rock and its winding, improvisational jams, 
was the band that created a cult of musicianship in rock. The trio was revered, 
but their meteoric career lasted only from 1966-68. Why did Cream turn sour? 
</P>
<P>
"Personality conflicts, hassles with fame, drug abuse -- we all had drug 
problems," Bruce replied. "A combination of many things. Cream was sort of an 
accident anyway. No one thought we'd get that big. We got over two good years 
out of it. That was enough." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce has been involved with various jazz, rock and fusion bands over the 
years, and has recorded assorted solo albums in Europe and the United States. 
Though none of these projects has made a huge commercial impact, he has always 
been a respected musician. But thanks to songwriting royalties -- he was 
Cream's main composer and has a catalogue of 150 songs -- he is financially 
secure. 
</P>
<P>
So why, in his late 40s, has he re-entered the rock 'n' roll grind? 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the money," replied Bruce. "I just want to reach as many people as 
possible with my music. There's an excitement that comes from having a large 
audience that I've missed. I want to recapture that feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Though noted for his skill with blues and rock, Bruce considers himself a jazz 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"When I left home at 17, I was working on this U.S. Air Force base in Italy," 
recalled Bruce, who was raised in a working-class family in Scotland. "That's 
where I got turned on to (jazz bassist Charlie) Mingus. I really wanted to get 
deeper and deeper into jazz." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce turned to jazz bass after briefly studying cello at a Scottish music 
academy. "Ginger and I started out as a rhythm section, playing free jazz 
influenced by people like Ornette Coleman. I was really into modern jazz. I was 
a snob." 
</P>
<P>
But Bruce also liked the blues. He played in three blues-based bands, headed by 
Alexis Korner, Graham Bond and John Mayall, before the formation of Cream. 
Clapton, who had also worked with Mayall, lured Bruce and Baker into the 
blues-oriented style that was the essence of Cream. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce is still ambivalent about Clapton: "We get along and we don't. If he 
walked in now I'd shake his hand and be friendly. But he's done stuff to rub me 
the wrong way. It's sort of love-hate." 
</P>
<P>
One thing that slightly miffs Bruce is that many fans think Clapton -- who is 
still a major star -- was the main singer and songwriter in Cream. "Eric helps 
perpetuate that myth in his own subtle way," Bruce said. "It's a minor thing, 
but it's still somewhat aggravating." 
</P>
<P>
The last time he saw Clapton, Bruce said, was when Clapton sat in with Bruce's 
band last year at the Bottom Line in New York. "I didn't get to talk to him 
much then," Bruce said. "We haven't really talked in years. But we'll get 
together again one day." 
</P>
<P>
That reunion might happen, Bruce said, on this tour if he and Clapton are in 
the same town. "The three of us would jam together," Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
Although his band is called the Jack Bruce Band With Ginger Baker, Bruce said a 
reunion would be different. "It would be like old times. We could call it Sweet 
Cream -- old but still sweet."

USC RECRUIT CONWAY SCORES 730 ON SAT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of USC's top football recruits last season, quarterback Curtis Conway of 
Hawthorne High School, scored 730 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test Nov. 4, 
making him eligible to enroll at USC next fall. 
</P>
<P>
After failing in four attempts to reach the SAT score of 700 required under the 
NCAA's Proposition 48, Conway decided to sit out this fall in an effort to 
retain his four years of athletic eligibility. USC did not accept players 
ineligible under Prop. 48 this year. 
</P>
<P>
Conway plans to enroll at El Camino College part time beginning next semester 
and begin his college football career next fall. USC had told Conway that it 
would honor its commitment to him if he passed the test. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not been in school this fall," Conway said, who was the state 100-meter 
champion last spring. "I have just been studying for the SAT test and working 
construction this year." 
</P>
<P>
Conway said he also plans to participate in track at USC. LONNIE WHITE

COLLEGE HOCKEY: FORUM TOURNAMENT SHOWCASES TOP TEAMS IN HOPE OF NURTURING 
DIVISION I PROGRAMS IN SOUTHLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Until recently, many Southland residents thought icing went on top of a cake, 
and Zamboni was probably a magician. 
</P>
<P>
But all this has changed since Wayne Gretzky joined the Kings in August of 
1988. Los Angeles has become a hockey town. Amateur leagues have doubled and 
tripled in size. 
</P>
<P>
And that is why the Forum is playing host to the Great Western Freeze-Out, a 
college hockey tournament matching some of the best college hockey teams from 
Canada and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie Buss, the Forum's special events director, is hoping that the 
tournament will help intercollegiate hockey gain more recognition in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see (NCAA) Division I hockey here," Buss said. "I think that it's 
important to have hockey here at that level. Since Wayne arrived, the Kings 
have generated so much interest, I can't imagine it not growing." 
</P>
<P>
But better facilities are needed. It is so difficult to reserve ice time that 
some local college teams must practice at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the University of Alberta, Denver University, the University of 
British Columbia and Michigan State, the Forum was able to arrange practice 
sessions at either Culver City Ice Arena or the Olympic Ice Arena -- the latter 
called "a converted barn" by one UBC player. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty brutal," UBC forward Kalle Furer said. "It was all hacked up, 
and the boards only came up to my hip. I wouldn't want to play a game in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Players who skated at the Culver City Ice Arena said it was adequate. They were 
not surprised by the popularity of local college hockey. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because the climate is warm doesn't mean that you can't have hockey 
teams," UBC left wing Dan Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that hard to make good ice. It's just a matter of keeping it at the 
proper temperature." 
</P>
<P>
About 8,000 tickets have been sold for tonight's 7:30 championship match 
between top-ranked Michigan State and the University of Alberta. On Monday 
night, the Spartans (17-3-1) defeated Denver, 2-1, and the Golden Bears 
(18-7-2) beat British Columbia, 5-4, in triple overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very excited about having been given the opportunity to prove ourselves 
against Michigan State," Baker said. "'People really think that the American 
universities are superior, but the Canadian schools are good, too. We just 
don't get a chance to play against them during the regular season." 
</P>
<P>
Luring the teams to Los Angeles, away from sub-zero temperatures, was easy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like you see in the movies and television," Michigan State forward 
Leif Gustafson said. "I'm happy to be playing here." 
</P>
<P>
A television contract for the tournament fell through. "We just want to make 
this tournament first-rate this year so that the television people will pick it 
up next year," Buss said. 
</P>
<P>
Buss hopes the tournament will become as popular as those played in Canada and 
the East. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Martinson, a hockey fan from Van Nuys, praised the tournament, saying: 
"I started coming to the (Kings') games last year, and now I have season 
tickets. I'll see any hockey game played in L.A. I'd like to see UCLA and USC 
play at the same level that these kids do. This is really great." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Simpson of Beverly Hills said: "The people who know hockey out here were 
never really involved because it was never taken seriously. Even the NHL 
players used to think that they were coming here for an easy two points and a 
day at the beach, but not anymore."

MELVIN DURSLAG: IT'S DEFINITELY AN OPEN-AND-SHUT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELVIN DURSLAG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As counsel for Sam Wyche, distinguished coach of Cincinnati, we wish to appeal 
the NFL ruling removing $3,000 from Sam on a rap you shortly will conclude is 
bum. 
</P>
<P>
Sam was nailed for closing the locker room doors to the sporting press after a 
recent game against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The fine is challenged here on two grounds. First, no effort was made on the 
part of authorities to look at the pictures. The instant-replay process has 
been instituted at the cost of millions, and no review was made to determine 
whether Sam merely shut the doors or locked them. 
</P>
<P>
If Sam shut them, is it his fault it never occurred to those outside to open 
them and walk in? 
</P>
<P>
Failure, too, to defer to instant replay deprived announcers from anticipating 
what the tape would reveal before the judgment was handed down. Announcers 
never wait for official disclosures. They take the position that if one can't 
guess what the verdict is going to be, one doesn't qualify as an analyst. 
</P>
<P>
The analyst says: "There is no way it can be ruled that Sam locked the doors. 
Look where his knee touched." 
</P>
<P>
Listening to Bill Walsh work the game on TV the other day between San Francisco 
and Buffalo, we were seized with the urge to tender Bill advice he would live 
with forever. He chose to outguess the instant-replay booth, insisting the 
runner was down before he lost the ball. 
</P>
<P>
When the tape disproved this, we wanted to assure Bill, "A seasoned expert 
never sets himself up to look like a chump. He waits for the ruling, then says, 
without equivocation, 'It comes as no surprise that the play was ruled a 
fumble. How could it be ruled anything else? Study the posture of the 
ballcarrier and his juxtaposition to the ground.' " 
</P>
<P>
Same with analyzing a game. 
</P>
<P>
"Wait until it's over, Bill," you say, "then tell your audience, knowingly, 'It 
was a foregone conclusion the Bills didn't have the smarts to handle San 
Francisco.' " 
</P>
<P>
How do you think guys in the newspaper business last 50 years? 
</P>
<P>
In behalf of our client, Sam Wyche, it also is argued that a fine of any kind 
is uncalled for in the light of the cultural deprivation he has suffered, 
separated from those coming into the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
You detach yourself from this cerebral force and, at game's end, you can't be 
asked, "Sam, what kind of pitch did you hit?" 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't hit any pitch. This is football." 
</P>
<P>
"Then when did you feel you had it won?" 
</P>
<P>
"We never had it won. We blew it, 24-17." 
</P>
<P>
Those breaking off communications with the sporting press have had to answer to 
authorities in the sky, who normally impose a curse. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Carlton, for instance, decided to sever relations with authors. He 
declared it would be his policy not to talk to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
So what happened to Steve? He came into baseball at 21 and, by 43, he was 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, he won 20 games only six times. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson locks his dressing room door. And you don't think Bo has been 
punished? He was limited to 32 homers last season and 105 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
And for all his notoriety, you count Bo's money and you find he hasn't even 
accumulated as much as the Sultan of Brunei. 
</P>
<P>
Nor has one of Bo's employers, Al Davis. Reclusive by nature, Al rarely 
converses with the sporting press, seeing it as an encroachment on his thinking 
time. 
</P>
<P>
So he pays for it. The forces arrange for Al to get nothing more than $18 
million from an antitrust suit, $8 million from an eminent-domain suit and $10 
million from Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
And now, if he gets lucky, the best he can dredge from Oakland, Sacramento or 
Los Angeles is a lousy $50 million for the pleasure of his team's company. 
</P>
<P>
When Al locked the doors on the press, he should have thought about the 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Defying counsel, Sam Wyche not only wants to pay his $3,000 fine but is 
recommending the money be turned over to a worthy cause. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to a worthy cause," the owners inform him. "It's going to us." 
</P>
<P>
Sam isn't stable enough to get into these kinds of scrapes. One week he fights 
with sportswriters, the next week he fights with Houston, running up 61 points

HUNTING: RICK HACKER PROVIDES CHRISTMAS DINNER THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY -- HE 
EARNS IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Rick Hacker introduced a visitor around the den of his home in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
There were Beauregard and Edgar, in their eternal staredown from opposite sides 
of the room. Sam and Harley were in their usual corners, silently ignoring 
everybody. 
</P>
<P>
Hacker said Harley will be guest of honor at the Christmas dinner his wife, 
Joan, will prepare, but it's not an honor Harley would recommend. Harley is 
also the dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"I name all my animals," Hacker said. "That's Beauregard the buffalo, Sam the 
ram, and that's Edgar, the five-point elk. We got 375 pounds of meat off him. 
That lasted us many years." 
</P>
<P>
That left Harley the antelope, who was named after a motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of going straight up, his horns go outside, like handlebars, so I 
called him Harley," Hacker said. 
</P>
<P>
Well . . . isn't that an honor, a measure of immortality, not only his own name 
but a role in two great traditions -- muzzleloading hunting and Christmas 
dinner? 
</P>
<P>
Hacker is the consummate holiday hunter. For the last 22 years, he has provided 
the Christmas meal with one of his antique single-shot weapons -- some 
original, some replicas, but all faithful to technology dating to the 1700s. 
His book, "The Muzzleloading Hunter" (Outdoor Life Books, distributed by 
Stackpole, $21.95), is the definitive treatise on flintlock and percussion 
weapons for the 20th-Century hunter. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always been a fan of the Old West," Hacker said. "It was a practical way 
to relive history and I like to hunt, and to me that is hunting personified -- 
the true way to hunt. You've got one shot, it's you one-on-one with the animal. 
You have to stalk, you have to be close. Most of my shots are 35 to 75 yards." 
</P>
<P>
Hacker, 47, also subscribes to an old-fashioned hunting ethic. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to eat everything I shoot," he said. "It's almost a religion with me." 
</P>
<P>
His book contains recipes for "muzzleloading meals," none likely to be found at 
Denny's: Rocky Mountain elk stronganoff, black bear corn-fried steak, wild boar 
chops. 
</P>
<P>
His table has been graced with all of those, as well as a San Marino sheep he 
shot on Santa Cruz Island, pheasant, wild turkey and venison. Hacker said that 
not only does this meat taste better than store-bought stuff, it's better for 
you. 
</P>
<P>
"No fat, no chemicals. People are used to eating animals that are full of 
artificial encumbrances. You can't barbecue wild game, because there's no fat. 
But I always wanted to have a wild boar for the holidays. There's a great 
illustration in one of my Dickens books of them bringing in this whole boar 
roast. So Joan cooked it in the oven, then I took it out to the barbecue, 
turned it up and flambeed it with bourbon. It was great." 
</P>
<P>
England, with its strong traditions, still has markets that sell wild game, 
Hacker has noted on visits there. 
</P>
<P>
"You lose a lot of contact with life by having everything so organized," he 
said. "You buy a piece of meat, put it in the microwave and it's done. If you 
hunt, the hunt lingers on throughout the meal." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Harley, the Hackers' dining room is not visible from the den, 
so diners will not feel his blank eyes on them during the meal. However, from 
his vantage point he may follow preparations in the kitchen and recognize a 
section of him that has been in a freezer while his head has been on a wall 
since Hacker brought him home from Montana in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Hacker calls it "the longest shot I ever made -- 225 yards, and he was running 
away uphill at an angle." 
</P>
<P>
The weapon was one of Hacker's favorites, the replica of a .40-90 Sharps -- 
.40-caliber, with 90 grains of black powder. It was built by his guide, John 
Schoffstal, and weighs 12 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"The traditional gun was what they called a Big 50 -- a .50-caliber," Hacker 
said. "The .40-90 became very popular with the serious, long-range hunters of 
the frontier years. You've got to be in shape to use these guns." 
</P>
<P>
Hefting the weapon, Hacker joked: "You can also club 'em to death with it. I 
was the first hunter in the 20th Century to shoot a buffalo with a .40-90 
Sharps." 
</P>
<P>
That would be Beauregard. Normally, Hacker wouldn't even try that long a shot. 
Muzzleloaders don't have telescopic sights, and the projectile moves so slowly 
that allowances must be made for wind and trajectory. By comparison, a .30-06 
bullet has a muzzle velocity of 2,700 feet per second, while a muzzleloader 
projectile exits at 1,050 feet per second. 
</P>
<P>
"But the beauty of it is that when it hits, nothing gets up," Hacker said. 
</P>
<P>
Hacker's standard load is a 435-grain lead conical bullet, made by the Buffalo 
Bullets company of Whittier. A .30-06 bullet weighs an average 180 grains. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't travel fast, but there's no doubt when they get there," he said. 
"It's like lobbing a boulder. You don't have any wounded game." 
</P>
<P>
So he had a good feeling about it and, against Schoffstal's advice, touched off 
a shot. 
</P>
<P>
"I set my trigger and used my tang sight and gave him a lot of lead and aimed a 
little bit high -- and shot. As I shot, the antelope dropped, and I heard 
something hit the ground behind me. It was John. He had dropped his gun (and 
said), 'How'd you do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the first time Hacker had impressed someone with his prowess. In 
1982, he became the first white man to hunt in Zimbabwe -- formerly Rhodesia -- 
after that nation's seven-year civil war. He used a .58-caliber black-powder 
muzzleloader to bring down a one-ton eland. 
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't been in Africa 48 hours when I'm crawling through the brush on my 
hands and knees with a native who doesn't speak any English, going after an 
animal I don't know how to spell." 
</P>
<P>
And when he found his prey, he said, "It took two bullets to put him down. 
That's unusual." 
</P>
<P>
Since he wasn't allowed to take the meat out of the country, he gave it to the 
natives. 
</P>
<P>
"That night I heard these drums -- boom-ba-boom-ba-boom -- and all this 
shouting." 
</P>
<P>
The tribe was celebrating his kill with a feast. 
</P>
<P>
"They gorged themselves all night, and the next morning they had yards and 
yards of it hanging to smoke." 
</P>
<P>
The natives knew what many city-dwellers don't, Hacker said. 
</P>
<P>
"Meat isn't 'gamey' if it's processed properly. The problem most hunters make 
in the field is they'll let the meat sit there for half a day while they take 
pictures and things. Forget the trophy pictures. You can always take those 
later. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's a big animal, you want to open the body cavity and air it out. You 
have to gut the animal immediately (to) let it cool (and discard) the stuff 
you're not going to eat. In the case of a big animal, I'll let that meat age 
for six days (to) let it break down a little bit. Then when you get back to 
camp, you hang it. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't let the hair of the animal touch the meat when you're skinning it. It 
can taint the taste of the meat. If possible, I'll take it right to a butcher 
(and) have him skin it, quarter it and bone it." 
</P>
<P>
When he got Edgar, Hacker was hunting with five conventional hunters who, he 
suspects, did not take him entirely seriously at the start. Hacker is not 
inconspicuous. At a practice range, his shots are noted by loud explosions and 
great clouds of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"There goes Hacker again," others say. 
</P>
<P>
As a muzzleloading hunter, he likes to dress the part, with coonskin cap and 
buckskin coat. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always the joke when I walk in because I dress like this," he said. "And 
when I say I'm from California, that clinches it. They all roll their eyes." 
</P>
<P>
But Hacker and Edgar had to hang out in camp, in a manner of speaking, for five 
days until the others got their animals. 
</P>
<P>
"Didn't hurt it at all. It was cold up there. If it's hot, you have a problem 
with flies. You should cover the meat with cheesecloth or some covering that's 
aerated (to) keep the insects off." 
</P>
<P>
Some hunters use plastic, but Hacker said, "There's no ventilation, and that 
will spoil the meat." 
</P>
<P>
And that, one supposes, would mean canned ham or frozen turkey for the table. 
</P>
<P>
"People lose touch with their heritage," Hacker said. "Christmas is such a 
traditional time and hunting is such a traditional sport that when you combine 
the two and you're eating a meal you hunted for the Christmas table, that's the 
epitome of the holiday celebration. That's what the pioneers did before there 
were grocery stores." 
</P>
<P>
Hacker recalled the film, "Jeremiah Johnson," when Robert Redford killed a deer 
in one scene and his family ate it in the next. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy behind me said, 'Oh, that's terrible.' I turned around and said, 'Well, 
I guess the Rocky Mountain Safeway was closed that day.' "

NEWSWIRE: LAST-PLACE KINGS FIRE BILL RUSSELL AS VICE PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Boston Celtic star Bill Russell was fired Tuesday as vice president of 
the Sacramento Kings, and Coach Jerry Reynolds became director of player 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
"It was in the best interest of the organization," Gregg Lukenbill, the Kings' 
managing general partner, said in a statement. "It has become evident that our 
franchise was not moving in a positive direction." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings (6-14) are in last place in the Pacific Division. There was no 
comment from Russell. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds will continue as interim coach until a permanent replacement is 
selected. Rick Benner, vice president for business, will replace Russell. 
</P>
<P>
Russell coached the Boston Celtics and the Seattle SuperSonics after concluding 
a playing career in which he was a five-time NBA Most Valuable Player. He was a 
basketball television commentator for 10 years before becoming coach of the 
Kings in 1987, where he compiled a 17-41 record over 11 months before being 
relieved as coach.

Penn State officially became the 11th school in the Big Ten, but it doesn't 
mean the conference will change its name. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, the Big Ten still sounds right even though it may very well be the 
Big Ten with an asterisk," said Stanley Ikenberry, president of the University 
of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Because of scheduling obligations, Penn State is not likely to play a Big Ten 
football schedule until the mid-1990s. Other sports should be able to 
participate sooner, some as soon as the 1990-91 school year.

U.S. DENOUNCES ROMANIA OVER DEATHS OF PROTESTERS 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration denounced Romania as the last police state in Eastern 
Europe and vowed Tuesday to try to find a way to punish the regime for its 
bloody repression of anti-government demonstrators as reports of violence 
mounted. 
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug cited reports, which it conceded were 
unconfirmed, that the death toll may have reached 2,000 in weekend clashes in 
western Romania near the Hungarian border. Other news agencies reported 
casualty figures ranging from a few dozen to several hundred. 
</P>
<P>
Romania sealed its borders to the outside world Monday. Attempts to reach the 
country by telephone were usually met by busy signals. 
</P>
<P>
In a report from Budapest, United Press International said visitors returning 
to Hungary from western Romania were describing a Tian An Men Square-style 
massacre of pro-democracy dissidents, with morgues filled with bodies and tanks 
patrolling the streets. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Washington is reviewing its 
already chilly relationship with Romania in search of "actions which can 
meaningfully be taken" and that it is discussing with its European allies a 
range of coordinated sanctions against Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting from reports filed by the U.S. Embassy in Romania, Tutwiler said the 
crackdown seems to have been limited to the area around Timisoara, a city of 
about 300,000 people in Transylvania. She said the embassy has sent two 
diplomats to the area to obtain firsthand information. She said that the 
embassy has been unable so far to determine the extent of the death toll. 
</P>
<P>
Tanjug and Budapest Radio reported more clashes Tuesday. The Associated Press, 
quoting Greek students who escaped to Yugoslavia, said that shooting was 
continuing in Timisoara and that fires were burning in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The students said many children were killed or wounded "because people used 
them as shields" in the erroneous belief that security forces would hold their 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
A Romanian doctor who arrived in Austria spoke of protesters stoning armored 
vehicles. He said that one vehicle drove into the crowd, crushing a woman. The 
AP reported that rows of people were mowed down by gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Tanjug reported from Bucharest that students in the capital have declared 
solidarity with the protesters in Timisoara and that police guards, in 
response, were posted in dormitories. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and leaders of other 
governments, both East and West, joined Bush Administration officials in 
condemning the Nicolae Ceausescu regime. 
</P>
<P>
"The repressive measures undertaken by the Romanian government are totally 
unjustified and stand in stark contrast to the positive changes taking place 
elsewhere in Eastern Europe," White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The demonstrations in Timisoara and elsewhere were a result of the systematic 
denial of human rights to the people of Romania, particularly to members of the 
Hungarian minority," Fitzwater added. 
</P>
<P>
Romania was once Washington's favorite member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact 
because of Ceausescu's independent foreign policy, despite the regime's chronic 
suppression of human rights. At one time, the United States praised Romania for 
refusing to march in lockstep with its allies. 
</P>
<P>
But with economic and political reform sweeping across Eastern Europe, 
Ceausescu's continuing refusal to conform has made him a pariah on both sides 
of the crumbling Iron Curtain. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, talking to reporters after an unprecedented visit to North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters in Brussels, said the Soviet Union 
"categorically opposed the use of force." 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the brutal repression of demonstrators by Soviet troops in 
Tbilisi, the capital of Soviet Georgia, earlier this year, Shevardnadze said: 
"Let me remind you of the tragic events in Tbilisi, after which I had to speak 
to the people. I condemned that (the use of force) in my remarks there. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is the same wherever it happens," he added. "Problems must be 
resolved through political means." 
</P>
<P>
In Prague, the Czechoslovak Parliament passed a resolution expressing "profound 
anger" at events in Romania. The government television network showed Polish 
and Hungarian parliaments also condemning the action of the Romanian security 
forces. Even Bulgaria, which had never before protested the action of another 
member of the Warsaw Pact, expressed "serious concern" over Romania's decision 
to close its frontier. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler said the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest "intends to protest in the 
strongest possible terms based on what our (diplomats) are reporting to us." 
</P>
<P>
She said the Administration is "reviewing our bilateral relationship, including 
economic, scientific and other areas, to determine if there are other actions 
which can be meaningfully taken." 
</P>
<P>
However, Washington has comparatively little leverage. In February, 1988, 
Romania renounced the most-favored-nation trade status that it had enjoyed for 
more than a decade.

ADMIRAL SCORES OFFICERS FOR LAPSES IN NAVY ACCIDENTS 
</P>

<P>
The chief of naval operations, in the wake of the Navy's unprecedented two-day 
break in operations last month, blasted his subordinates Tuesday for lax 
adherence to safety procedures and inattention to safety training and 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
In a message to Navy skippers and other leaders summarizing the findings of 
fleet commanders, Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost repeated the Navy's claim that "no 
single thread" linked an unusual series of accidents that triggered the 
first-ever fleet-wide "safety stand-down." 
</P>
<P>
But in reviewing the details of 10 major Navy accidents in the two months 
before the Nov. 15 safety break, Trost said that he found several related 
lapses in officers' oversight of safety training and operations. 
</P>
<P>
"The level of effective supervision on the scene was often inadequate when 
accidents occurred," Trost said. 
</P>
<P>
In a reference which suggests that safety deficiencies found aboard the 
battleship Iowa may be more widespread than previously believed, Trost singled 
out "incomplete job indoctrination" -- Navy shorthand for lack of job 
qualifications -- as a problem throughout the fleet. 
</P>
<P>
"Supervisors assumed that subordinates had a level of knowledge higher than 
they actually possessed," Trost told skippers. "We need to look at each 
subordinate and make sure they know their job." 
</P>
<P>
A Navy investigation of the April 19 blast aboard the Iowa, in which 47 sailors 
died, uncovered "discrepancies" between established safety training procedures 
and actual practices on the ship. In the turret where the blast occurred, for 
instance, only nine of 37 sailors handling explosive equipment or devices were 
qualified to serve in their jobs. 
</P>

The Iowa tragedy, which the Navy said was probably caused intentionally by one 
of its sailors, was one of 67 major accidents that occurred this year before 
Trost and Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III called for the two-day halt in 
operations last month. 
</P>
<P>
Since the safety stand-down, there have been five major accidents that have 
resulted in two deaths, bringing the total this year to 104, said Lt. Frank 
Thorp. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply must do better," Trost told Navy leaders. "To do so takes officer, 
chief petty officer and experienced petty officer attention on every 
safety-related detail of what we do on the sea, under the sea and in the air." 
</P>
<P>
Some private naval authorities criticized Trost for neglecting to make the 
connection between the problems that led to the safety review and those that 
were evident in the immediate wake of the Iowa explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"Adm. Trost didn't just close the book on the safety stand-down, he closed his 
eyes to the problem," said retired Rear Adm. Gene R. LaRocque, director of the 
Washington-based Center for Defense Information. "There's your thread when 
accidents occurred. In the case of the Iowa, all of those problems were 
dismissed as unimportant. Now, they suddenly have become important." 
</P>
<P>
LaRocque called Trost's conclusions "fatally flawed" because they failed to 
make officers accountable for the inadequate supervision he cited. 
</P>
<P>
"The chief of naval operations should have said: 'I will hold every captain, 
every commanding officer of station, every squadron and flotilla commander 
personally accountable for the safety of personnel and materiel.' " LaRocque 
said, adding that Trost should have issued the statement long ago. 
</P>
<P>
Trost cited specific concerns raised by fleet commanders in their reports to 
him at the end of the two-day Navy safety reviews, including complaints that 
qualified senior leadership is neither sufficiently involved in the planning of 
major exercises nor on hand to oversee them. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Trost said, fleet commanders reported that "compressed at-sea 
schedules preclude proper confidence training for junior personnel." 
</P>
<P>
LaRocque criticized Trost for failing to propose changes in Navy schedules or 
planning policies. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's an opportunity for the chief of naval operations to say, 'I'm going to 
use my influence with the Joint Chiefs of Staffs and change the exercise 
schedule to enhance safety,' " LaRocque said. "If something's wrong with the 
sea schedules, that's not something the commanding officer of a ship or the 
petty officer on a gun mount can do anything about."

CZECHOSLOVAK PREMIER URGES FREE MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring that only a free market system can reverse decades of economic 
decline here, Czechoslovakia's new prime minister Tuesday proposed fundamental 
changes that would essentially dismantle his nation's Communist economic 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
After 40 years of Communist rule, "much of our inherited national wealth has 
been dissipated," Prime Minister Marian Calfa told the Federal Assembly, 
Czechoslovakia's Parliament, as he outlined the government's legislative 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, "we have to accept the market with all its advantages, but also 
its disadvantages." 
</P>
<P>
Calfa, a Communist who presides over a largely non-Communist government, also 
said the government plans to introduce new laws in January that would guarantee 
freedom of religion, speech and association, the rights of the media and the 
functioning of a free democratic political system. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, the Parliament, dominated by long-obedient Communist 
deputies, voted unanimously to approve the government's policies. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, deputies one after another took advantage of live national 
television coverage of their meeting to assure constituents that they support 
the speedy election of activist playwright Vaclav Havel, leader of the Civic 
Forum democratic movement, as the nation's next president. 
</P>
<P>
The government plans to hold free elections here next spring, and even 
Communist members of the assembly who had opposed Havel only a few days ago 
appear to have decided that supporting him is their best hope for gaining 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies have been receiving a flood of letters, telegrams and petitions 
supporting Havel. And to reinforce the message Tuesday, they were greeted by 
thousands of students, many of whom had come to Prague in special chartered 
trains, who gathered near the assembly building with pro-Havel banners and 
placards. 
</P>
<P>
Havel's victory is now all but assured. "It does seem I am the likely person to 
be elected," he said at a news conference Tuesday. Late Tuesday evening, the 
Parliament's Presidium announced that the election will be held on Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Calfa's speech was a remarkable embrace of free-market principles. The 
government, he noted, will continue to provide services for which the market is 
ill-suited, such as education and health services, and will strive to ensure 
full employment while fighting inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "we cannot afford to experiment" with half-measures that would 
mix some market principles into the nation's current centrally planned system. 
Only a free market, he said, can "ensure economic rationality, an increase in 
the standard of living of the population and rational use of natural 
resources." 
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of the new year, he added, the government would 
introduce laws to break up the giant state monopolies that now dominate the 
economy; legalize all forms of private property; authorize companies to sell 
stocks; establish open markets for money and capital, and begin a "progressive, 
but not hesitating, introduction of a convertible currency." 
</P>
<P>
The current state pricing office will be turned into an anti-monopoly 
commission, he said, and the government will move "urgently" to close old, 
inefficient factories. 
</P>
<P>
The government, for the first time, also will introduce an unemployment 
compensation system. It will propose a new state budget that will sharply 
restrict government spending, reducing the size of the bureaucracy and cutting 
money for the army and the police. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, he said, the aim will be to "create all conditions to make 
Czechoslovakia an equal partner integrated into the world economy." 
Czechoslovakia will ask for some form of "association" with the European 
Community, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Calfa pledged to try to make the transition to a free market as 
painless as possible, he also warned that "the government cannot permit rising 
wages without increasing productivity." 
</P>
<P>
Calfa's speech went far beyond the ideas he outlined in a news conference after 
he was appointed last week. The new statements clearly reflected the thinking 
of his finance minister, Vaclav Klaus, who likes to call himself the "Milton 
Friedman of Czechoslovakia," a reference to America's most prominent 
conservative free-market economist. 
</P>
<P>
In describing his goals, for example, the prime minister chose words that would 
fit easily into a Republican Party platform in the United States. The free 
market "gives every individual the opportunity to follow his own interests and, 
at the same time, benefit all others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the debate that followed, only a few hard-line Communist deputies departed 
from the basic direction set by Calfa's speech. The government must preserve 
"the unchangeability of our socialist system," one deputy said. "We're entering 
into a new era of socialism," said another. 
</P>
<P>
Most deputies, however, chose instead a tack that would have been familiar to 
American legislators, using their time on television to press parochial 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Several deputies from mining regions, for example, raised the plight of miners 
who are likely to lose their jobs in the coming economic restructuring. A 
deputy who represents an area with a large ethnic Hungarian population called 
for a new ministry to handle minority affairs. And a delegate from Prague asked 
government ministers to examine the city's housing shortage. 
</P>
<P>
The one common theme, other than support for Havel, was concern about the 
nation's severe environmental problems, as delegate after delegate rose to 
complain about dirty air, contaminated food and rising cancer rates. 
</P>
<P>
The parade of endorsements for Havel began with Calfa himself, who was quickly 
joined by the nation's Communist minister of national defense and most of the 
other members of the new government. 
</P>
<P>
When the vote comes, Havel is likely to be the only candidate nominated for the 
presidency. One potential opponent, Alexander Dubcek, who led the nation's last 
reform effort in 1968, is expected to be elected chairman of the assembly. 
Another candidate, Cestmir Cisar, an official in Dubcek's government, withdrew 
from the race Tuesday night and endorsed Havel.

BOY, 12, REPORTEDLY HAD CRUSH ON GIRL HE'S ACCUSED OF KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 12-year-old boy, identified by friends as the one who shot and killed a 
classmate in the Mall of Orange in Orange County, had a crush on the girl and 
sometimes brandished a pistol to act tough, his friends said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Classmates and acquaintances said the boy, a seventh-grader at Cerro Villa 
Middle School in Villa Park, was infatuated with Jacalyn (Jackie) Calabrese, 
12, of Orange, whom he allegedly shot in the head Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
One youngster, Matthew Palmer, also 12, said the boy had been showing a 
.25-caliber handgun to friends for more than a month. A relative said he did 
not know where the boy got the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew said that the boy showed him the weapon again on Monday evening -- 
before he visited the mall with Jacalyn and several of her friends. 
</P>
<P>
"He showed me there were bullets in it," Matthew said. "It scared me. It was 
the first time I had seen bullets in the gun's chamber." 
</P>
<P>
The boy was arrested Monday night after he allegedly shot the girl and fled 
from the mall. He sought refuge at a friend's home, where a member of the 
household eventually persuaded him to call his parents. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Police Sgt. Art Romo said a .25-caliber semiautomatic pistol was found 
near a house in a residential area west of the mall. 
</P>
<P>
A decision regarding prosecution is not expected until after police and 
prosecutors meet today, said Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. John D. Conley, 
who handles juvenile cases. The boy is being held without bail at Orange County 
Juvenile Hall on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Although police said it was premature to advance any theories about the 
shooting, witnesses said it appeared that Jacalyn's death was a bad joke gone 
awry. The boy reportedly shot the girl once in the forehead after he displayed 
the weapon and she voiced doubts that it was a real gun. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just all mellow and trying to be cool in front of Jackie," said Keli 
Edwards, a seventh-grader who was with the two youngsters when the shooting 
occurred. "He looked at me like, 'Oh, my God! I didn't mean to do that!' " 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that this boy did this deliberately. Kids do foolish things," 
the victim's mother, Gloria Calabrese, said Tuesday, fighting to hold back her 
tears. "This act . . . it's senseless and I don't think there ever will be an 
answer for anything so senseless." 
</P>
<P>
Angie Calabrese, 15, said her sister had talked to the boy earlier in the 
evening and he had come by their house to take her to the mall. Before Jackie 
left for the mall, Angie said, her sister was in the "best of moods." 
</P>
<P>
"I do feel sorry for him," she said of the boy. "I don't know what would have 
made him do such a thing. They've known each other since fourth grade." 
</P>
<P>
Flag at Half Staff 
</P>
<P>
At Cerro Villa school -- where the victim and the boy attended -- the American 
flag flew at half staff Tuesday. Nine psychologists were present to help 
students deal with the tragedy, said Roger Duthoy, an assistant superintendent 
of the Orange Unified School District. Dozens of students met with the 
psychologists throughout the day, some merely to talk about their feelings 
about Calabrese and the unidentified boy. 
</P>
<P>
"For these 12- and 13-year-olds, there was a lot of soul searching. They wonder 
how could this possibly happen to a friend," said David Bastin, a psychologist 
for the district. "They want a way to blame somebody so the whole incident can 
be resolved immediately. Some side with Jackie, some side with the boy. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're trying to tell them, don't place blame like this."

BONE-MARROW TRANSPLANT TO BE TESTED AGAINST AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Medical researchers in Los Angeles County intend to begin testing bone-marrow 
transplantation as a treatment for some AIDS patients, in light of a case in 
which a man appeared to have been purged of the AIDS virus after physicians 
replaced his bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
A team of transplant specialists at City of Hope National Medical Center in 
Duarte is among several groups nationwide that plan to test the experimental 
procedure on a small number of patients with AIDS-related lymphomas, or tumors 
of the lymph nodes. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure, which entails eradicating an impaired immune system in hopes of 
cultivating a new one, is considered extraordinarily risky, however. Several 
dozen previous attempts at treating AIDS patients with similar transplants have 
produced disappointing results. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to be very circumspect in how we proceed with the treatment 
using bone-marrow transplantation," said Dr. Ronald Mitsuyasu of UCLA, who has 
tried the technique. "We don't want to kill the patient in the process of 
trying to help them." 
</P>
<P>
The plan to test the procedure at centers in California, Washington, Minnesota 
and Maryland was fueled in part by a report from Johns Hopkins University in 
Baltimore, where researchers believe that they purged an AIDS patient of the 
human immunodeficiency virus. 
</P>
<P>
The case, reported at the International AIDS Conference in Montreal last June 
and published Wednesday in Annals of Internal Medicine, involved a 41-year-old 
man whose defective bone marrow was replaced by researchers with marrow taken 
from a healthy sister. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who was also treated with the anti-viral drug AZT, died of cancer 47 
days after the operation. Researchers found no traces of the virus in his body 
either while he lived or in an autopsy performed after his death from his 
AIDS-related lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an exciting case, but it's just one," said Dr. William Burns, a member of 
the team involved in the work. "It's probably a year before we know if this is 
going to be something important for treating AIDS or not." 
</P>
<P>
Other experts in AIDS treatment raised similar reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take patients living a lot longer to see if we really have been 
able to render that patient free of the (consequences) of the AIDS virus," said 
Dr. Stephen J. Forman of City of Hope, whose team helped to analyze the Johns 
Hopkins case. "It may be that the AIDS virus may still be in the body and the 
AZT is preventing it from infecting the cells." 
</P>
<P>
"My concern is that there will be a misinterpretation that we're dealing with a 
cure for AIDS, which this certainly is not," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director 
of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 
</P>
<P>
At least initially, the four medical centers intending to test the procedure 
plan to use it only on patients with AIDS-related lymphomas and leukemia. The 
reason is that patients with those conditions, even in the absence of AIDS, are 
sometimes treated with bone-marrow transplants. 
</P>
<P>
The procedure used by the Hopkins group involves exposing the patient to high 
doses of chemotherapy and radiation. The purpose is to eliminate cancerous 
cells from the patient's body and knock out the AIDS-impaired immune system to 
make way for transplanted marrow. 
</P>
<P>
They then inject into the patient's blood stream about a quart of bone-marrow 
cells drawn from the hip bone of a sibling donor. Those cells make their way 
into the patient's bone marrow and begin to grow, generating new, healthy, 
immune-system cells. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the patient is treated with intravenous AZT, a drug that has 
been proven to block replication of the AIDS virus. The AZT is intended to 
prevent any virus remaining in the body from infecting the new immune system 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
Bone-marrow transplantation, which costs up to $200,000, is fraught with 
complications even when used in more traditional ways, such as against 
leukemia. As many as one-third of all patients die within the first year alone 
from the procedure itself, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
The complications include a condition called graft-versus-host disease, in 
which cells in the transplanted marrow attack the patient's tissues. That 
condition can increase the patient's susceptibility to infection -- already a 
problem in AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
The Johns Hopkins patient died from a relapse of his cancer, despite high doses 
of chemotherapy and radiation. Forman of City of Hope said that illustrates the 
fact that cancer cells are sometimes stronger than chemotherapy and radiation. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the therapy appeared to work against the AIDS virus, but failed 
to conquer the patient's AIDS-related cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Fauci said he had recently tested bone-marrow transplantation, without 
chemotherapy and radiation but with AZT, on 16 AIDS patients whose donors were 
identical twins. Marrow donated by identical twins is less likely to be 
rejected by the patient. 
</P>
<P>
"We have found that apparently there is no lasting impact on the clinical 
course of the patient," Fauci said in a telephone interview. "Some do well, 
some died, some have transient improvements. . . . Our experience is that the 
effects are only transient." 
</P>
<P>
Mitsuyasu, an assistant professor of medicine at UCLA's AIDS Research Center, 
said UCLA had been conducting a study of bone-marrow transplantation in AIDS 
patients since 1983. But he said the university had tried the procedure on only 
three patients so far. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always had enthusiasm for our study," Mitsuyasu said. "It's just that we 
want to select our patients carefully. . . . It's a very aggressive treatment 
with a fairly high morbidity and mortality rate compared to other treatments." 
</P>
<P>
He said the procedure has other worrisome implications. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost problem becomes a factor," he said. "We're talking on the order of 
$100,000 to $200,000 for a typical bone-marrow transplant. And that obviously 
is going to put a strain on the patient as well as the health care system."

<P>
The chairwoman of the California State University trustees misstated her 
academic credentials when she told the governor's office and the state Senate 
that she had received an Associate of Arts degree in literature from Long Beach 
City College in 1959, she acknowledged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Marianthi Lansdale -- wife of Long Beach developer William M. Lansdale, a 
generous political supporter of Gov. George Deukmejian -- conceded to The Times 
that she had never received her community college degree, although she listed 
the degree and a 1959 graduation date when the governor nominated her to the 
prestigious board in 1985. She was unanimously confirmed by the state Senate 
for a term that expires in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
As chairwoman, Lansdale heads a 24-member board charged with making policy 
decisions for one of the largest public four-year university systems in the 
world. Lansdale selects colleagues to serve on special committees, chairs board 
meetings six times a year, and helps set the tone in salary negotiations with 
the system's 19,200 faculty members. The board chair is rotated among members, 
who elect the presiding officer for a one-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach City College records show that Lansdale attended the school for 13 
semesters between 1957 and 1967 -- eight years past the date of her claimed 
graduation. Lansdale said she took night courses because she was a working 
mother struggling to raise a child and put her first husband through college. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lansdale said she accumulated the 60 credits needed for the AA degree, 
the Long Beach patron of the arts acknowledged Tuesday that she never received 
the formal degree because she lacked a required course in either geography or 
history. The 1959 graduation date is also included on the current official CSU 
information sheet for Lansdale. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what? I never thought anybody would write a story or cared or it 
mattered," she said Tuesday. "It wasn't like I lied about a traffic infraction 
or a felony or a fraud. I'm just a good solid citizen and I never thought I 
would be living in a fishbowl." 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale, 57, said Tuesday that she "doesn't care" that she misstated her 
educational background, emphasizing that she received credits "equivalent" to 
an AA degree. She also blamed the misrepresentation on her part to confusion 
and the fact that she is unaccustomed to filling out application forms. 
</P>
<P>
'Don't Even Care' 
</P>
<P>
"People who read your article don't even care. You know that?" she said. "I 
think they ought to be proud a working mother attended and found the time and 
ability to attend school at night." 
</P>
<P>
But Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said Tuesday that 
Lansdale should step down. Had the Senate known that she misrepresented her 
educational credentials, she would not have been confirmed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes to the heart and substance of what she does on the board," he said. 
"The board . . . in effect sets the value of the degree and to falsify your own 
degree information is intolerable." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Deukmejian said Tuesday the governor's office was checking into 
whether Lansdale's education claims were subjected to a background check before 
being sent on to the Senate as part of the confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale was appointed to the state university board after she and her husband, 
through their Long Beach development company, gave more than $95,000 and the 
use of a corporate aircraft to Deukmejian's 1982 campaign, public records show. 
Board members do not receive a salary, but are paid $100 a day and expenses for 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Lansdale acknowledged that her nomination to the CSU 
board in 1985 surprised her, especially since she had not attended a four-year 
institution and did not have a bachelor's degree. She also said that her 
political activity was a factor in prompting the governor to make the 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked diligently and hard in raising money for the governor," Lansdale 
said. "This is his way of saying, 'You did a good job and this is a prestigious 
appointment and you're going to do a good job.' That's just the ABCs of the 
political world." 
</P>
<P>
CSU Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds said Tuesday that the lack of a college degree 
has not dimmed Lansdale's enthusiasm or ability to serve as a trustee, for 
which there are no educational requirements. She said the misrepresentations by 
Lansdale "do not bother me" and that trustees cannot be held to the same 
standards as university employees, who can be fired if found to be falsifying 
academic credentials. 
</P>

THE CENTRAL VALLEY'S CURSE: KILLER TULE FOG OF WINTERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it blows in across the seashore, the mood becomes melancholy. Workers 
lower their heads and reach for woolen mufflers, lighthouses sound hoarse 
bellows from their klaxons. 
</P>
<P>
But when the fog rises up from the ground, wet and cold and dripping thick -- 
and most of all, stubborn -- in the Central Valley, it tests the will, it tests 
the eyes. It tests one's control of the machine he is driving. The mood is 
heavy with anxiety. And nearly every year people die. 
</P>
<P>
In the Central Valley, they call it Tule fog. It is as reliable an indicator of 
winter as the snows of New England. And sometimes as severe. 
</P>
<P>
It is a fog that lowers spirits and shortens the schedules of schools. But most 
of all, it it throws a frightening blanket on transportation. 
</P>
<P>
A drive across town becomes a anxious test of skill. An airline reservation 
becomes a maddening ordeal. Highways become nightmares of screeching tires and 
colliding steel. And sometimes, such as happened Tuesday, even the trains 
become prey in the fog. 
</P>
<P>
Fog was a factor in a 69-vehicle accident near Tracy early Tuesday morning. 
Fifty-five vehicles were involved in a series of 14 separate injury accidents 
in Merced County the same day, and 14 cars plowed together near Manteca. In one 
accident, a small toxic cloud mixed with the fog when a swimming pool service 
truck was rear-ended, rupturing containers of chlorine and acid. 
</P>
<P>
"This time of year makes me wonder why I do this," said Michale San Clemente, a 
flower grower from Jamestown in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Twice a week, he 
delivers his roses to the San Joaquin Valley, logging 350 miles per trip. On 
Tuesday, he set out in the thick gloom at 3 a.m. "This big gravel truck pulled 
out in front of me. . . . I (hit the brakes and) went completely sideways. I'm 
dreading my delivery days." 
</P>
<P>
"It would be OK if everyone would slow down, but of course they don't," said 
Bruce Eldridge, a professor at UC Davis, who recalled near-accidents when 
driving in the fog. On Tuesday, he had the misfortune of switching and taking 
the train on a trip south. His was the train that crashed. 
</P>
<P>
"I still feel the most dangerous place to be is behind the steering wheel," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Even non-drivers dread these foggy days. "It's cold, I'll tell you that. I hate 
it. I hate it. It cuts through to your bones," said Telly Jackson, 27, a 
homeless person at the Reyes Senior Park in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has lived through a winter in the Central Valley knows of the fog 
and has stories to tell. Anyone who has not may find the phenomenon hard to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
Local authorities advise motorists to stop at intersections, roll down their 
windows, and listen in both directions before proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
Days can stretch into weeks without a glimpse of the sun. Never mind the 
publicity hounds who go into caves for long periods to study the effects of 
darkness on the human psyche. Just send them to the Central Valley during a fog 
spell. 
</P>
<P>
Visibility can approach zero in what the California Highway Patrol calls 
"critical" Tule fog. That can means you see no farther than your hood ornament. 
News reporters tell of threading through two highway pileups just to get to the 
wreck they are assigned to cover. These are not exaggerations. 
</P>
<P>
Tule fog season runs from November to March, with December and January the 
killer months. National Weather Service meteorologist Lyle Hammer in Fresno 
said that long-term weather records in the Central Valley show that dense fog 
can be expected nearly 40 days a year -- 6.2 days in every November, 12.3 days 
in December, 11.6 in January, 6.3 in February and 1.8 in March. These are 
averages. Some tell of periods of more than 50 days straight without sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
The Highway Patrol could not provide regional accident statistics. But 
statewide highway fatalities mirror the Central Valley fog patterns. In 1988, 
eight people died in fog-related automobile accidents, 15 in November, 20 in 
December, 11 in January and one each in February and March, according to the 
CHP. 
</P>
<P>
CHP spokesman Ten Eichman, described by headquarters at the patrol's "Mr. Fog," 
said the winter decrease in visibility ranks right behind alcohol as the 
motorists' biggest nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Boren, a long-time reporter for the Fresno Bee, recounts what it is like to 
drive long-distance through dense fog. His trip was from San Francisco to 
Fresno earlier this week: 
</P>
<P>
"It was about 2 a.m. when I got into the valley. I couldn't go any faster than 
20, sometimes slower. You couldn't see more than three white lines in front. I 
had my head out the window sometimes. It was unnerving -- you could only cross 
your fingers that somebody wouldn't come racing up and hit you from behind. And 
then you had to strain to see ahead. Sometimes the patches of fog were so thick 
you would drive into them and just hope there was nothing ahead to hit. 
</P>
<P>
"My daughter slept the whole way. Her father was terrified." 
</P>
<P>
Ground fog is created when weather conditions in the Central Valley are stable, 
the air moist and still. The ground cools at night and chills the adjacent air. 
Moisture condenses and a ground-hugging cloud forms. As long as there is no 
wind to disperse the cloud, the process continues and the fog grows thicker and 
denser each day. A typical pattern is to see a few days of fog only in the 
mornings or late nights. Then the fog progressively thickens. The sun fades to 
only a glow. Finally, all that is left is a gloomy, gray soup. 
</P>
<P>
Tule fog is named for the cattail-like tules that grew in Tule Lake, which once 
covered the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley and created the moisture 
which fueled the fog. 
</P>
<P>
As airline travelers know, airports throughout the Central Valley struggle with 
the fog -- notably Sacramento, Stockon, Fresno and Bakersfield. At Sacramento, 
51 of 140 flights were canceled Tuesday because of fog. Among them was the Los 
Angeles-to-Sacramento flight of Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, who was headed to the 
Capitol for an important news conference where he was named a special 
prosecutor in the growing Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Airport spokeswoman Laura Gipson said the number of cancellations was unusually 
high. On a normal December day, only 20 to 25 flights would be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
The Stockton Municipal Airport was closed all day. From the control tower, a 
spokesman shrugged, "Can't see 100 yards." 
</P>
<P>
Then there is Eli Setencich, a columnist for the Fresno Bee. Each season at 
this time his eyes mist up and he swears it is not from the fog. "I like it. 
It's the only thing that's different here." he said. Then he read from a column 
on the subject: "To hear the experts, you'd think the black plague is coming. . 
. . If anything, fog sharpens the vision -- you can see that telephone pole in 
your path or the red tail light on the truck you did not realize you were 
following. Nothing can heighten awareness like a good, thick fog."

40,000 EAST GERMANS CHEER AS KOHL BACKS 'REVOLUTION'

DRESDEN, East Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, winning a more rousing welcome than he ever 
received at home, promised here Tuesday to support the "peaceful revolution" in 
East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In return, East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow, after his first meeting with 
the chancellor, declared that Berlin's historic Brandenburg Gate will be opened 
by Christmas. Modrow also said East Germany will allow visa-free travel for 
West Germans into East Germany, beginning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl was wildly cheered by an estimated 40,000 people, who chanted, "Helmut, 
Helmut, unity, unity." A banner across a blackened church tower proclaimed: 
"Helmut: With You to Unity." 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators mostly carried the West German black, red and gold flag, which 
far outnumbered the few East German banners. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl and Modrow, the reformist prime minister who was Communist party chief in 
Dresden before moving to Berlin, met Tuesday morning. Later, Kohl and his aides 
said Bonn will offer East Germany at least 10 billion Deutsche marks, or $5.8 
billion, in credits to revive the deteriorating economy. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl declared: "In this difficult situation for East Germany, we will not leave 
our countrymen in East Germany in the lurch." 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, he attempted to walk a fine line between encouraging 
German reunification and being polite to his host, who opposes German unity. He 
said, "My aim remains -- if history allows -- the unity of the German nation." 
</P>
<P>
The chancellor said he will meet Modrow early next year and hopes to sign a 
treaty leading to cooperation in economic matters as well as in transport and 
social policy. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, East Germany's Modrow told the news conference: "The existence of 
East Germany is something we will not give up. 
</P>
<P>
"We agree on our responsibility for peace in Europe. Our decision to build 
closer cooperation step by step is a point of departure that all our neighbors 
-- ours and yours -- can trust." 
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that all political prisoners in East Germany will be freed 
soon, perhaps by Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Modrow did not specify the date when the East Germans will open the Berlin Wall 
at the Brandenburg Gate, the city's most famous symbol, but he indicated that 
it would be for pedestrian traffic only. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Kohl placed a wreath at the ruins of the Church of Our Lady, bombed like 
most of Dresden during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
To a crowd that cheered almost every line, Kohl, who called those at the 
gathering "my compatriots," said events in East Germany represented the first 
peaceful revolution in German history. 
</P>
<P>
But he added: "Self-determination makes sense for Germany only if we do not 
neglect the security rights of others. The house of Germany must be built under 
a European roof." 
</P>
<P>
Kohl ended his speech in the chilly dusk with the words: "God bless our German 
fatherland." 
</P>
<P>
During Kohl's various appearances, some members of the crowd taunted one 
another, because many were for a reunited Germany, while others insist on 
keeping East Germany a separate and socialist state. 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin, anti-unity demonstrators marched through the city center 
chanting the slogan: "Never Again Germany." They made a point of waving East 
German flags, which bear the Communist Party's insignia. 
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting were both countries' economics ministers, who are 
expected to begin drafting agreements under which West Germany will begin 
underwriting part of the East German economy. Bonn Economics Minister Helmut 
Haussmann and East German Foreign Trade Minister Gerhard Beil said they expect 
trade and investment to rise sharply next year. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Dresdener Bank, West Germany's second-largest, revealed plans 
to open a branch office here in Dresden, where the company was founded more 
than 100 years ago.

LITHUANIA LEADER URGES SPLIT WITH SOVIET PARTY;

<TEXT>
<P>
The leader of the Lithuanian Communist Party called on the party Tuesday to 
declare its independence from the Soviet Communist Party in an unprecedented 
move that he described as essential if Lithuania is to restore its sovereignty 
as a state. 
</P>
<P>
Algirdas Brazauskas, the forceful and charismatic first secretary of the 
Lithuanian Communist Party, told a special congress here that the national 
party, through its past complicity with Stalinism and its failure to keep up 
with the demands of the people for reform, has virtually lost its authority to 
govern. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing Communist leaders throughout Eastern Europe, Brazauskas urged his party 
to rebuild itself by first admitting its past errors and asserting its 
independence from Moscow -- and then by making the re-establishment of 
Lithuanian statehood and the reshaping of the political and economic systems 
here its primary goals. 
</P>
<P>
"We can renounce the past only through radical changes," Brazauskas declared. 
He outlined further measures, including a full multi-party political system, a 
market economy and the sale of state enterprises to private companies that will 
take Lithuania far beyond the reforms proposed by President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev for the Soviet Union as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
However, the ultimate focus of those changes must be Lithuanian independence, 
he continued, challenging on an issue so sensitive that Gorbachev had publicly 
and repeatedly warned the Lithuanian party and Brazauskas personally against 
this break with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev's warnings had little evident impact as speaker after speaker 
rose to denounce the Soviet party and to call for the independence of the 
Lithuanian party. 
</P>
<P>
Only two delegates dared to challenge the majority view. "The Soviet Communist 
Party is strong enough a structure to carry out reforms itself, and I do not 
see any basis for severing relations with it," Leonid Jankulewicz, a regional 
party leader, said. "We should limit ourselves to adopting a new program." 
</P>
<P>
When the 1,038 delegates vote today, more than two-thirds are expected to 
endorse Brazauskas' call for a break with the Soviet party in a move that will 
send political shock waves through the country's other constituent republics. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gorbachev has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to accept the 
changes in Eastern Europe as the result of "freedom of choice," Lithuania, the 
other Baltic republics of Estonia and Latvia, and later perhaps Armenia and 
Georgia will challenge that commitment to the utmost. 
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas, while emphasizing Lithuania's desire for "independence" and 
"sovereignty," avoided answering directly the implicit question of whether 
Lithuania would remain a part of the Soviet Union or secede. 
</P>
<P>
"Our future is in a union of sovereign states," Brazauskas said. "We broadly 
support Mikhail Gorbachev's policies as a guarantee for the sovereignty and 
economic independence of our republic. This will make it possible to build a 
Soviet Union from which it would then be possible to secede if desired." 
</P>
<P>
Arvydas Juozaitis, a leader of the Lithuanian national movement Sajudis, 
praised Brazauskas' speech as important psychologically as it was politically. 
</P>
<P>
"This declaration of independence from the Soviet Communist Party is a dress 
rehearsal for the declaration of independence of Lithuania," he said later. 
"Secession is not just a juridical problem and a political problem, but it is 
also a psychological problem. That has now been overcome." 
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas, speaking of Lithuanians' longing for the independence enjoyed for 
two decades from the end of World War I to its absorption by the Soviet Union 
in 1940, said that "every nation strives to have its own state -- the problem 
is how to realize those aspirations." 
</P>
<P>
In its new program, the Lithuanian Communist Party declares that its primary 
goal is "building a democratic society and the maximum implementation of the 
basic humanistic goals of socialism, the most important of which are liberty 
and social justice." 
</P>
<P>
"This goal can be achieved in Lithuania at present only on the condition that 
it is an independent state," the program says. "Therefore, the restoration of 
Lithuanian statehood is the prime task of the Communist Party of Lithuania." 
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas, acknowledging that his party had little chance of winning the 
republican elections scheduled for February, said that only by such a break 
with the Soviet party and the reorientation of the Lithuanian party could it 
reassert its political leadership here. 
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas also proposed that the Lithuanian Communists form a "united front" 
with other political parties and groups, including Sajudis, to promote 
political and economic reforms here and move Lithuania toward independence. 
</P>
<P>
Most political observers believe that the Communist candidates would win 
perhaps 35% of the seats in the local elections in late February, with four new 
parties dividing the rest. 
</P>
<P>
"After the election, I believe there will be no force capable of forming a 
one-party government," Justas Paleckis, head of the party's ideology 
department, told journalists. "In terms of Lithuania and its situation, we 
might go into a coalition, and this is already taking shape with members of 
Sajudis becoming involved (in decision-making). 
</P>
<P>
"Moscow will not object, not really. All the changes taking place here are with 
Moscow's accord." 
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas proposed the restructuring of the Soviet Communist Party so that it 
becomes a federal organization -- something already rejected by Gorbachev.

Britain's Prince Charles, whose attacks against modern buildings have shaken up 
his country's architects, will attend a celebration of the American Institute 
of Architects during a weeklong visit to the United States in February. 
</P>
<P>
A royal spokesman said the Prince of Wales also will attend the opening in 
Washington of an American Architectural Foundation exhibition on the 
architecture of Sir Christopher Wren, who built London's St. Paul's Cathedral. 
</P>

During the visit, which is scheduled to begin Feb. 16, Charles will be a guest 
at the American Institute of Architects' Accent on Architecture celebration in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Charles, heir to the British throne, attacked the modern face of architecture 
in his recent book "A Vision of Britain," in which he complained that high-rise 
buildings had ruined London's old skyline of church spires and domes.

SOUTHERN BOMBINGS PUT FOCUS ON HATE GROUPS

<P>
A broad spectrum of civil rights organizations, alarmed by the deadly bombings 
in the South, has gone on a heightened state of alert amid speculation that 
hate groups may be responsible for the wave of violence, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the groups, including the NAACP, the Anti-Defamation League 
of B'Nai B'Rith and the Center for Democratic Renewal, joined judges and other 
court employees in taking extra precautions while opening mail and other 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, a mail bomb killed U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert 
S. Vance, who prevented white supremacists from taking over the Alabama 
Democratic Party. On Monday, another mail bomb killed Savannah, Ga., Alderman 
Robert Robinson, a lawyer active in a contentious school desegregation case. On 
the same day, a bomb found in the 11th Circuit Court building in Atlanta was 
disarmed, as was one found Tuesday at the Jacksonville, Fla., office of the 
NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frightening," said Sunny Stern, assistant area director of the American 
Jewish Committee in Atlanta. "Any time this type of hate group spews out 
against any group of people, we know we can be a target as well." 
</P>
<P>
The distinct possibility that racist motivation is behind the bombings has 
renewed attention on white supremacist groups, raising questions about who they 
are, where they operate and how they have changed over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Civil rights organizations are busy compiling answers, warning that while the 
number of Ku Klux Klan members has declined during the last decade, newer, more 
violent groups have sprung up, attracting disciples in droves. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals who monitor white supremacist groups say the recent violence may be 
a reaction to recent court decisions -- including the 1987 award of $7 million 
to the mother of a teen-ager murdered by the klan in Mobile, Ala. -- and a 
sense that violence is necessary to keep their movement growing. 
</P>
<P>
"They feel that their options are limited," said Charles F. Wittenstein, 
counsel for the Anti-Defamation League. "Violence is the only thing left. They 
may be hitting out at an institution like the Court of Appeals that has 
traditionally defended the rights of blacks, Jews and other minorities." 
</P>
<P>
At the Center for Democratic Renewal, also known as the Anti-Klan Network, 
Leonard Zeskind, research director, said that the klan, perhaps the oldest and 
best known of hate groups, saw its membership plummet from an estimated 15,000 
in 1980 to some 6,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
But in addition to the klan, remembered for kidnapings and killings of blacks, 
Jews, Catholics and civil rights workers for decades in the Old South, there 
are now the Skinheads, the Neo-Nazis and Posse Comitatus. There is the 
California group called the White Aryan Resistance, and Dallas is the home base 
for a group called the Confederate Hammer Skins. 
</P>
<P>
In all, said Zeskind, his organization has identified some six-dozen hate 
groups, with 20,000 "hard-core" members nationwide and another 150,000 
sympathizers -- people who are on mailing lists and may attend meetings 
occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a burgeoning of this movement," Zeskind said. "People think it's 
going away when you have it increasing." 
</P>
<P>
The Klanwatch Project of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., 
estimates that 230 such groups are operating, and are responsible for 11 
murders, 100 shootings and assaults, and 60 cross-burnings during the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
A report by the project said that the groups' "cult of violence" has grown more 
brutal during the last decade. A combination of factors fuels the white 
supremacist movement, the report says, including the groups' ability to reach 
huge audiences of prisoners and disenchanted youth through cable television. 
</P>
<P>
And the youthful Skinheads, the report says, are "the most violent group of 
white supremacists this country has seen in a quarter-century." 
</P>
<P>
Morris Dees, the director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said: "Skinheads 
were considered the radical upstarts of the 1980s, but they are on their way to 
becoming the domestic terrorists of the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
In Jacksonville on Tuesday, a longtime resident said Skinheads are highly 
visible there. "My wife and I were by a park . . . not long ago, and there was 
a group of them standing around there," he said. "They were obvious by their 
attire -- black clothes, combat boots, shaved heads and swastika tattoos." 
</P>
<P>
Although no state is without members in these groups, analysts say, the 
greatest numbers are in the eastern half of the country, in California and in 
the Northwest. A map by the Southern Poverty Law Center depicting locations of 
various groups shows heavy concentrations of klan members from Pennsylvania 
down through eastern Texas and large numbers of Skinheads in California. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody paid any attention to the groups" before the recent bombings, says 
Willis Edwards, president-emeritus of the Beverly Hills-Hollywood NAACP. "Now, 
people are saying, 'We'd better take another look.' " 
</P>
<P>
The fear rising from speculation about the bombings has been profound, 
affecting the groups in seemingly contradictory ways. On the one hand it has 
had an energizing effect, as several rights activists cited the bombings as 
reason to enact legislation that would mandate federal collection of data on 
racist incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Others said they have been told that potential members are afraid to join the 
rights groups because of the bombings. Additionally, the Atlanta NAACP office 
was the target of a smoke bomb earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have said they don't want to be involved (with the NAACP) 
because it's too big a risk," Edwards said. "These hate groups are very serious 
people. They're nothing to play with. They're out to win." 
</P>
<P>
In some parts of the country, the groups have demonstrated openly. About six 
months ago, for example, a small klan march took place in Savannah. And similar 
marches occur periodically in and near Atlanta. Lately, many of those marches 
have been aimed at immigrants, especially Mexicans and Asians. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some people connected with racist organizations dispute the 
theory that racists committed the bombings. A woman answering the telephone of 
a man who publishes an anti-minority newspaper in Marietta, Ga., Tuesday called 
speculation about racist bombings "a smear." 
</P>
<P>
The woman, who refused to give her name, said: "Nobody wants to be connected to 
such a thing" as the bombings. "I think the FBI is investigating the drug 
lords. They should be investigating Morris Dees." 
</P>
<P>
As for stories about racist groups, she said: "The media's wrong to be jumping 
to conclusions. They're climbing up the wrong back."

VICTIMS LINKED BY DESEGREGATION CASES; 
</P>
<P>
BOMBINGS: U.S. APPEALS COURT JUDGE HAD ORDERED SCHOOL BUSING. ATTORNEY HAD 
REPRESENTED NAACP IN SCHOOL LAWSUIT.

<P>
The two victims of mail bombs in the South had something in common -- both were 
known as civil rights advocates, and both may have died for their activities. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Robert S. Vance, 58, had ordered busing for school desegregation, sided 
with blacks in suits against white-controlled city governments and reinstated a 
federal lawsuit against members of the Ku Klux Klan in Alabama during his 11 
years on the federal appeals court based in Atlanta. He died after the bomb 
exploded at his home near Birmingham on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Robinson, a 42-year-old black attorney and city alderman in Savannah, 
Ga., represented the NAACP earlier this year in seeking a stronger 
desegregation program for his hometown school system. He was killed by an 
explosion at his office Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Federal investigators said Tuesday they suspect a "possible racial motivation" 
in the two killings. 
</P>
<P>
The civil rights link was heightened Tuesday when a bomb was discovered at the 
Jacksonville, Fla., offices of the NAACP. A fourth bomb addressed to the clerk 
of the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals was discovered and dismantled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Just three months ago, Vance, who was white, spoke for a three-judge panel of 
the 11th Circuit Appeals court in reviving a school busing order in 
Jacksonville. Siding with NAACP lawyers, Vance reversed a district judge who 
said court-ordered busing should be ended after 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Vance lambasted Jacksonville school officials for what he called their 
"consistent failure" to meet the desegregation goals of a 1971 decree. The 
failure to hire more black teachers and administrators also "perpetrated the 
effects of the prior system of segregation," he wrote in an opinion issued on 
Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
The 11th Circuit, which handles appeals from Florida, Georgia and Alabama, has 
continued to order busing for school desegregation, even as federal judges 
elsewhere have eased the pressure on school officials. 
</P>
<P>
In October, for example, the court in a highly publicized ruling in Georgia 
said that DeKalb County schools in suburban Atlanta must consider new busing as 
a way to remedy increasing segregation. Lawyers said Vance did not sit on the 
three-judge panel that decided the case. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys described Vance as a passionate liberal on most social issues, but a 
tough, accusatory questioner in the courtroom. His aggressive style had gained 
him a certain prominence among appellate lawyers in the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very aggressive jurist. At one point during the argument, he was 
shouting at me and was red in the face," said Cindy Laquidara-Kenney, the 
attorney who represented the Jacksonville school district. "If he didn't like 
what you were saying, he would cut you off in mid-sentence," she added. 
</P>
<P>
"He liked to pick on lawyers, and a lot of them didn't like it," said Neil 
Bradley, an attorney with the Southern regional office of the American Civil 
Liberties Union in Atlanta. "He was a liberal across the board, except for 
capital punishment and the Cuban refugees." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Vance took a hard-line stance against convicted murderers who 
appealed their death sentences, and he was impatient with lawyers representing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
But ACLU attorney Bradley noted that Vance was a different person off the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
"He was quite likable. Garrulous. A joke teller. He liked to tease you," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Vance's prominence in legal circles, Bradley and other attorneys say 
they find it hard to believe that his court rulings could have prompted the 
bomb attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"The appellate judges are generally invisible. You hear about trial judges, but 
not appeals court judges," he pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, Vance became chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party and is credited 
with wresting control of the party from Gov. George C. Wallace. In 1978, 
President Jimmy Carter appointed him to the federal appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Robinson, the Savannah attorney, say he was not known as a prominent 
civil rights attorney. They expressed surprise Tuesday that he might have been 
chosen as a target by extremists. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson practiced out of a modest Savannah townhouse and handled a variety of 
civil and criminal cases. While he represented black plaintiffs in the Savannah 
desegregation case, a New York-based attorney handled most of the appellate 
work, a friend said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a one-man firm. He was a surviving attorney," said fellow alderman 
Willie Brown.

OILMAN RECALLS ENCOUNTER WITH 'EL BANDITO'; 
</P>
<P>
CORRUPTION TRIAL: HE SAYS MONTOYA CAST A FAVORABLE VOTE, THEN QUICKLY HINTED 
THAT PAYMENT WAS DUE.

<P>
State Sen. Joseph B. Montoya once cast his vote in favor of a bill to help 
independent oil producers and then promptly hinted that he expected payment 
from the group, an official of the organization testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Hunt, executive vice president of the California Independent Petroleum 
Assn., said Montoya approached the group's lobbyist minutes after voting for 
the bill and asked, "Has my matter been taken care of?" 
</P>
<P>
Hunt said he was "disgusted" by Montoya's statement, which he interpreted as an 
attempt to make sure the group delivered on a pledge to give the senator a $500 
campaign contribution. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the brief encounter with Montoya, the Whittier Democrat's 
aggressive fund-raising efforts had already earned him the nickname "El 
Bandito," Hunt told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya is on trial on 12 counts of extortion, racketeering, bribery and money 
laundering stemming from an undercover federal investigation of Capitol 
political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
The charges stem from eight separate incidents involving a variety of bills, 
including the 1987 legislation to help independent producers of natural gas 
compete against giant utilities such as Pacific Gas &amp; Electric. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, authored by Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles), was designed 
to help the small producers form cooperatives so they could sell gas directly 
to cities and factories. The bill passed the Assembly easily and was sent to 
the Senate Energy and Public Utilities Committee, of which Montoya was a 
member. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt testified that the petroleum association was advised by its lobbyist, 
former Assemblyman Robert Cline, to give a campaign contribution to Montoya and 
several other committee members. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya was singled out for a contribution because he had missed committee 
meetings in the past, Hunt testified. 
</P>
<P>
"This would help ensure that at least the senator would be there," Hunt said. 
"This would help ensure his attention to the merits of the bill. And also, Sen. 
Montoya liked to help people who were interested in his political future." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya read a newspaper during the committee meeting and another member slept, 
Hunt recalled, but ultimately the panel approved the bill on a 7-0 vote with 
Montoya voting for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt said that as he, Cline and other members of the oil group stood in a 
hallway outside the committee room savoring their victory, Montoya walked by 
and asked the lobbyist, "Has my matter been taken care of?" 
</P>
<P>
Cline was taken aback but responded, "Yes senator, I think so. I'll check on it 
for you," Hunt recalled. After the senator walked away, Hunt said, Cline called 
Montoya "El Bandito." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt, who once worked as a lobbyist in Louisiana, told the jury: "I was 
disgusted that an official, particularly a senator, would ask that question 
right after a vote. I was dismayed that this sort of thing was happening in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
After the brief conversation with Montoya, Cline checked the group's records 
and confirmed that a $500 check had been sent to Montoya by the oil producers' 
political action committee, Hunt testified.

DIANNE KLEIN: IT'S FOR WOMEN -- CHRISTMASES PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dianne Klein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My husband announced the other night that he had bought my Christmas present. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, you can always take it back," he added next. 
</P>
<P>
Usually he delivers that thoughtful line as he hands me the gift itself, so 
this represents a progression. 
</P>
<P>
Who knows, maybe this time when he gives me the present the sales receipt will 
be tucked next to the bow -- just to make things simpler, more streamlined. 
</P>
<P>
I've noticed that this has emerged as a general pattern in my husband's holiday 
habits over the past few years. He's cutting back, unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
Recently he announced over lunch with friends that all of his Christmas 
shopping was done. When I heard him say this, I turned, incredulously at first, 
thinking about my sister's husband, my father, his mother, not to mention my 
own mother, but then I stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Of course he's done. He's a man. 
</P>
<P>
Men don't do Christmas shopping, not really, not in the sense of making lists 
and checking them twice and certainly not if they have wives or girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
Men say things like, "The mall's too crowded" or "I don't know what to get," 
and with such penetrating insights, they excuse themselves. ("And besides, it's 
Saturday. There's a game on!" some have been known to add). 
</P>
<P>
So instead, they'll ask the women they know to pick up something for their 
mother, their father, brother, nieces, nephews, sister and grandmother -- since 
you're going anyway -- and these women will nod, maybe even smile. They will 
shop. 
</P>
<P>
I know about this, you understand. I am one of the biggest suckers around. 
</P>
<P>
Let me say right here that I am not a woman with a lot of spare time on her 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
I do not relish crowds, or waiting in line 15 minutes at the cash register, or 
going upstairs to customer service for a box, which usually doesn't fit anyway, 
and then like a rabbit leading the greyhounds, enticing at least one cruising 
motorist to follow me so closely toward my parked car that a front tire comes 
within inches of clipping my heel. 
</P>
<P>
But I go. I shop, box and wrap. This year, my husband mailed. I asked him to. I 
had more shopping to do. 
</P>
<P>
So why do I do this? I am a feminist. I believe in equality of the sexes, equal 
pay for equal work. And when has my husband ever shopped for my relatives? Try 
never. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, I've been asking around. Not one woman friend of mine can remember a 
time when her husband or boyfriend went on a solo shopping spree for her 
relatives. Forget about them actually doing it, but an offer might be nice. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings me to another holiday truth, one that I am not entirely proud of. 
As much as women may complain about doing it all themselves, there is a certain 
perverse joy to it. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas is supposed to be infused with that warm, fuzzy feeling. Everybody 
expects this and women, usually, make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
We shop, bake Christmas cookies, thread banisters with ropes of fake pine 
needles, heap holly and pine cones atop mantles and dangle mistletoe over 
doorways. 
</P>
<P>
Men sometimes string lights and pick up a carton of eggnog at the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, no doubt about it, this is a sexist, inequitable distribution of labor. 
But at least women are in control, thank God. 
</P>
<P>
One friend of mine, a professional woman with a 14-year-old son, says she's 
been orchestrating Christmas all of her married life. She doesn't particularly 
enjoy it, she explains, but she married young and didn't know any better. Now 
she knows too much. 
</P>
<P>
Lord knows what kind of presents her husband would come back with if he were 
set loose in the mall. Better she should do it herself than be mortified by 
gifts that will bear her name too. 
</P>
<P>
Another working mother says she addresses all of her family's Christmas cards, 
including those mailed to business acquaintances she has never met, because 
even her doctor has better handwriting than her husband does. 
</P>
<P>
And one woman I talked to is still buying the gifts for her in-laws even though 
she and her husband of 16 years have recently divorced. (Obviously, this is a 
clinical case.) 
</P>
<P>
As for my own husband, while Santa's helper he is not, I don't mean to imply 
that he's some sort of Scrooge either. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in fact, he really went out on a limb. While I was taking a nap 
after an exhausting morning of shopping, he brought home a Christmas tree and 
set it up in the living room. This was supposed to be a nice gesture, in the 
spirit of the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
But when I came down the stairs, not only was I surprised, I was stunned. Keep 
in mind that I was barely awake, so I wasn't in full command of my senses. 
</P>
<P>
I told him that the tree looked, uh, a little small and suffice to say, he did 
not take it well. He told me that I could go out and get my own tree, which, 
true to my Christmas nature, I did. 
</P>
<P>
I dragged off his tree, shoved it in the back of the station wagon, returned 
it, bought a new one and installed it in the living room -- all by myself. When 
it was done, I was tired, scratched, cold and not very happy. 
</P>
<P>
But I was back in control. And I have to admit, it felt good. 
</P>

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL DELAYS ACTION ON ETHICS RULES 
EXEMPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fair Political Practices Commission on Wednesday postponed action until 
January on a staff recommendation to exempt public officials in small cities 
from certain conflict-of-interest regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Discussion of the issue, prompted by a dispute in Signal Hill, was delayed when 
officials from Southern California cities could not reach Sacramento after the 
city's airport was closed because of fog. 
</P>
<P>
Public officials whose principal residence is 300 feet to 2,500 feet from a 
development are restricted from voting on the project unless it affects the 
value of their homes the same way it affects other nearby property. The 
commission staff has proposed exempting officials in cities with populations 
less than 25,000, where council members are elected on an at-large basis and 
the city is 10 square miles or less.

NONE HURT AS CAR BOMBING AT MALL DELAYS HUNDREDS

A car bomb went off in a Sherman Oaks Galleria parking structure Tuesday, 
causing no injuries and little damage but delaying hundreds of holiday shoppers 
for hours while police checked surrounding cars for explosive devices. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police officers cordoned off the first floor of the seven-level 
parking structure while they probed the incident, in which a white Jeep 
Cherokee received minor damage about 4 p.m. Police said the driver was not 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the bombing, shoppers heading for their cars were met by 
security guards and police who instructed them to return to the stores. 
</P>
<P>
Fran Benitez of North Hollywood, who was shopping with her two children, said 
she went to a department store's television display to watch a Lakers game 
after being turned back from the parking structure. At 7:30 p.m., she found she 
still could not return to her car. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hungry. We're tired. The Lakers lost," she said. "What else is there for 
us to do? We're shopped out. I don't want to go back in there." 
</P>
<P>
The Jeep was parked in a lot reserved for employees of the stores and for 
workers in an adjacent office complex, where the car's driver works. Police 
initially roped off more than 50 spaces in the employee lot and more than 100 
surrounding spaces used by shoppers. Stores in the Galleria remained open 
during the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a car bombing involving an improvised explosive device," said Detective 
Ken Bourne. "We have no definite suspect or motive at this time." 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Angela Buono, described by police as a San Fernando Valley resident 
in her 20s, said she jumped from the vehicle when she heard strange noises and 
saw smoke while backing the Jeep out of a parking space. 
</P>
<P>
Shopper Greg Manns said his arms were already filled with merchandise when 
police directed him back into the Galleria. Manns said he spent another $300 
during his return to the shops. 
</P>
<P>
"If this was a ploy by the mall, it worked," he said. "I'm extremely 
frustrated. I'm trying to be as patient as I can, but we're all bummed out." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Basile, who works for a finance company in the Galleria's office complex, 
said his car was just two vehicles away from the Cherokee. He said officers 
kept him from inspecting his car for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Might as well finish my Christmas shopping," he said. "I'm going up to May Co. 
and I'll worry about my car later." 
</P>
<P>
Another office complex employee, Phyllis Grogan, opted to sit next to a 
security guard until police allowed her to return to her car. "I'm done 
shopping for this year, so all there is to do is wait," she said. 
</P>
<P>
At 5:30 p.m. police began allowing some shoppers to return to their cars. By 8 
p.m. the damaged Jeep had been towed from the parking structure, although 
officers kept the employee lot cordoned off while they used flashlights to 
search for evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Bourne said damage to the Jeep was confined to the underside and engine areas. 
Cars on either side were slightly damaged by debris and one had a flat tire, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a large device," he said. "It appears to be minor damage." 
</P>
<P>
Bourne is assigned to the Police Department's criminal conspiracy unit, which 
handles bombings. He refused to elaborate on the type of device, how it was 
attached or its explosive potential. 
</P>
<P>
"All that's under investigation," he said.

STUDIOS, RESIDENTS CLASH OVER BURBANK GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burbank homeowners and film studio executives faced off at a Burbank City 
Council meeting Tuesday night over proposals to control growth in the city's 
Media District. 
</P>
<P>
Studio executives asked the council for more flexibility to develop their 
facilities, while homeowners complained that the restrictions on development 
contained in the proposed Media District Specific Plan will not adequately 
protect their neighborhoods from increased traffic, air pollution and noise. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't want to look out their front windows and see massive high-rises," 
said Ted McConkey, a member of the Burbank Rancho Homeowners. "We're asking 
that no building in the Media District be more than five stories in height." 
</P>
<P>
Jack O'Neill, vice president of real estate for NBC, said the studios should be 
allowed to build up to 20 stories high. 
</P>
<P>
"The five-story restriction is an extreme position, which I think would just 
cut off development completely in the city of Burbank," O'Neill said. "The 
studios have a special role and a special economic base in the city and the 
Specific Plan should respect that." 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people attended the meeting, at which the council was to consider 
the proposed Media District Specific Plan. When the plan reaches its final 
form, after a process that includes revisions, an environmental impact report 
and more public hearings, it will guide development in the Media District. 
</P>
<P>
The district, dominated by several motion picture and television studios, is a 
1.2-square mile area bordered roughly by the Ventura Freeway, Oak Street, 
Keystone Street and Clybourne Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Studio executives argue that they need to build more office and studio space to 
keep up with competitive demands. But homeowners complain that the studio 
properties are already overdeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
All the studios that have offices there have said they want to expand their 
facilities. The Burbank Studios, which include Warner Bros. and Columbia 
Pictures, want to build almost 3.8 million square feet of space. NBC and Walt 
Disney each want to build 1.4 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, Burbank officials have been attempting to formulate a 
plan that will accommodate those landowners who want to develop their 
properties as well as nearby residents determined to keep noise, traffic and 
pollution from overwhelming their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the proposed Media District Specific Plan is what city officials 
say may be one of the strictest building controls in the state. Under that 
provision, developers might be allowed to build only one square foot of floor 
area for every square foot of property they control. 
</P>
<P>
Height limits on high-rises are also being considered, and developers who want 
to build structures more than 35 feet high might have to apply for 
conditional-use permits, which would require them to hold public hearings. 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank Rancho Homeowners has also called for developers to be assessed a 
special "neighborhood preservation fee" of $1.50 per square foot of office and 
commercial space. The money would be used to mitigate increased traffic, noise 
and other problems caused by the new development.

DRESS CODE DISPUTE PUT ON HOLD FOR HOLIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Student indignation over a new dress code at Peary Junior High School in 
Gardena, which was to be capped with a sit-in by protesters last Friday, was 
defused when Principal Alvin L. Hayes Sr. offered to discuss the new standards 
with the students after the winter holidays. 
</P>
<P>
A group of about 20 students had planned the sit-in to protest the code on the 
last day before winter break, but classmates failed to join them in a walkout 
after roll call. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they were afraid," said Michele Martinez, 13, who waited with other 
students for more than an hour for their classmates to join them. "There were 
police everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Two unmarked Gardena police cars and four patrol cars were sent to the campus 
after school security officials requested backup, said Lt. David Morgan of the 
Gardena Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The protests were prompted by a revised dress code imposed by the school's 
shared-decision-making council -- a group of parents, teachers, community 
members, the principal and one student. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 180 students walked out Dec. 12, and about 15 students walked out the 
following day, Hayes said. Students said more protesters scaled fences to leave 
campus on both days. 
</P>
<P>
The dress code, which went into effect Dec. 11, prohibits such clothing as tops 
that expose bare midriffs, garments printed with suggestive language and items 
associated with gangs, including hats, hair nets, bandannas and gloves. 
</P>
<P>
Students objected most vehemently to restrictions banning a single earring, 
which school officials said is sometimes a symbol of gang affiliation, and 
clothing with holes, including blue jeans with tears.

HEALTH CARE COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I applaud Dr. Neil Schram's article (Dec. 5) on cutting the cost of death to 
provide health care to the living. I am a registered nurse and help to bridge 
the gap between the physicians and families who must make these decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Many times the decision not to take away life support measures prolongs 
suffering for both the patient and the family. Guilt, selfishness and/or 
ignorance can interfere with the decision to stop treatment. Families should be 
well-informed what treatments are actually done. 
</P>
<P>
Resuscitating a terminally ill person or elderly person can be very brutal. I 
am trained to provide care to people in time of sickness; yet am trained to 
help them die with dignity, when the time comes. In this day and age, when we 
have so many technological advances, we can keep people alive too long. Let's 
provide health care to the living.

Gov. Deukmejian is right.

It's time the prisoners helped out. With job opportunities they will be able to 
improve their financial standing, learn to live honestly in society and take on

GRETZKY COLLECTS SIX POINTS IN KINGS' 9-5 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
INGLEWOOD 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It had been a lost weekend for the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
A once-promising trip had turned sour with consecutive losses in New Jersey and 
Philadelphia, dropping the Kings into third place in the Smythe Division, just 
two points ahead of the Winnipeg Jets. 
</P>
<P>
So the Jets came to the Forum Tuesday night with a chance to catch the Kings in 
the standings, but instead, all they caught was the fury of an angry team. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings scored early, explosively and often in defeating Winnipeg, 9-5, 
before a crowd of 14,158. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Kings' highest-scoring game so far this season. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way were Wayne Gretzky, with two goals and four assists, and Keith 
Crowder and Steve Duchesne, who also scored two goals apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, already the NHL scoring leader, pushed his point total to 73. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' first goal came on a power play, 2:55 into the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky, often on the giving end of great passes, was on the receiving end of 
this one. Defenseman Brian Benning faked a shot from the left side, then slid 
the puck past a couple of Jets to Gretzky, who was coming in from the right 
side. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard enough to stop Gretzky head on, but Winnipeg goalie Daniel Berthiaume 
never had a chance on this one as Benning's fake left him leaning the wrong 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky easily flipped the puck in for his 16th goal, and his fifth on the 
power play. 
</P>
<P>
The second goal looked a lot like the first. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Tom Laidlaw, back in the lineup after missing four games due to a 
slash over his right eye, set up the second score after stealing the puck. 
</P>
<P>
He passed it to winger John Tonelli who, like Benning, came in from the left 
side, faked the slap shot and then pushed a pass through the slot. 
</P>
<P>
The recipient this time was Crowder, who shoved the puck through Berthiaume's 
glove side at 14:44 for his second goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
His first came just two games ago in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum is King left winger Luc Robitaille, who 
entered play Tuesday night tied with Brett Hull of the St. Louis Blues for the 
league lead in goals with 26. 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille scored his 27th at 16:55 off a centering pass from Gretzky to give 
the Kings a 3-0 lead.. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings scored four more in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Duchesne scored his 10th goal at 2:54 of the period on a slap shot off a pass 
from Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
At 13:12, Duchesne got his second goal of the night and 11th of the season on a 
rising shot that Berthiaume deflected, but couldn't control, the puck getting 
past him. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings added two more in a span of 40 seconds on a night when the Jets' net 
seemed to have a magnet in it. 
</P>
<P>
Crowder scored his second on a pass from Tonelli at 16:18. 
</P>
<P>
And just like that, he had doubled his season total for goals. 
</P>
<P>
His first, last Friday night, came after a 21-game drought. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the Kings scored again at 16:58 on a play that must have convinced the 
Jets, if they still needed any convincing, that they could do no right this 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg's Brent Ashton appeared to be clearing the puck when Berthiaume stuck 
out his stick, stopping the puck right in front of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Two Kings were on the spot to respond, Mikko Makela to tap it over to Gretzky, 
who popped it in. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets only goal in the first two periods came off the stick of center Thomas 
Steen, who scored his 10th goal at 10:32 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, who have been criticized of late for lax defense, especially when 
they are comfortably ahead, reverted to their old, bad habits in the final 
period, giving up four Jet goals. 
</P>
<P>
But on this night, even a scoring output such as that wasn't enough to stop a 
King team determined to vent its frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Kings began play Tuesday night with 35 points, eight fewer than they had at 
the same stage a year ago when they were 21-11-1. . . . Right winger Jim Fox, 
who retired last month because of knee problems, was honored before the game as 
the Kings' NHL man of the year for his charity work in the community. . . . 
Another King, goalie Kelly Hrudey, was given the same honor as Islander man of 
the year for his charity work in the New York area before being traded to Los 
Angeles. . . . Fox and teammates Dave Taylor, Bob Kudelski and Mike Allison 
will deliver toys today to kids at the St. Joseph's Children's center in 
Venice. . . . After a tough trip that included six cities in nine days, the 
Kings are home for two weeks. Following the Jets to the Forum will be Quebec 
(Thurs.), Vancouver (Sat.), Calgary (Dec. 27) and Philadelphia (Dec. 30).

REDSKINS' SEASON LEAVES ONE TO WONDER WHICH QUESTIONS TO ASK; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: ANOTHER SEASON WITHOUT A PLAYOFF BERTH LEAVES WASHINGTON PLENTY 
OF TIME TO PONDER ITS FUTURE.

Gerald Riggs was not the answer. 
</P>
<P>
Dexter Manley was the answer, but to the wrong question. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the matter of the Dallas Cowboys. Ask yourself about that one. 
</P>
<P>
When the Washington Redskins look back on this season, and they'll have to 
eventually, it may take some time to figure out just exactly what took place. 
Even after watching the films. 
</P>
<P>
We know they missed the playoffs, and for the second consecutive year, which, 
in the Joe Gibbs era, amounts to a serious slump. 
</P>
<P>
We know, too, that if the Redskins were to win this Sunday against Seattle, it 
would be their fifth consecutive victory and leave them with a 10-6 record, 
which might win in a few divisions of the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
So, which is it: Are the Redskins on the way down or on the way back? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's both. 
</P>
<P>
Once, the Redskins were a consistent Super Bowl contender, a candidate for team 
of the '80s, a better bet around town than Ronald Reagan. Those days seem to be 
over. In the age of parity, the NFL's top tier has shrunk to one team, the San 
Francisco 49ers. Maybe Denver could argue the point. 
</P>
<P>
But then you have the Philadelphia Eagles, a team supposedly on the way up, now 
in a late-season struggle. And you have the New York Giants, a team that was 
supposed to be on a slide, back in contention. What happened to Buffalo? And 
now the Green Bay Packers are part of the way back. These are confusing times, 
folks. 
</P>
<P>
As the season began, with the Redskins coming off the 7-9 debacle that followed 
the Super Bowl title, it didn't look that confusing. The Redskins thought they 
were in great shape. Doug Williams would return. They picked up running backs 
Riggs and Byner. The hogs were healthy. The defense looked sound. Dexter Manley 
was learning to read. 
</P>
<P>
And then everything that could go wrong did go wrong. They lost to the Giants 
and Eagles to start the season, with one setback more improbable than the next. 
In each, the game was lost on a fumble by Gerald Riggs, famous for not 
fumbling. Then Riggs hurt his foot and disappeared to become the ghost of 
George Rogers past. 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks later, as quarterback Mark Rypien was struggling, Gibbs made the 
strange decision to throw a rusty Doug Williams, only minutes off the injured 
list, back into the ring. Williams would look a lot like Roberto Duran, and so 
another game was lost and with it the season. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, there was the Dexter Manley trauma, as Washington's most popular 
player failed a third drug test and was banned for life to many tears and much 
beating of breasts. Barry Wilburn also had drug problems, was suspended and 
then put on the injured reserve list. There were other injuries, including 
cornerback Darrell Green and most of the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, if you take away the two fumbles, the Redskins could be looking at a 
12-4 season and talking Super Bowl. If they don't become the only team in the 
league to lose to the Cowboys, they might be headed for the playoffs, and 
suddenly the future doesn't look so dim. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Rypien came on strong in the end after nearly losing his job. They must 
have fed the incredible fumbling quarterback an all-glue diet. But who was he 
coming on against? The Redskins' home-stretch schedule of Chicago, Phoenix, San 
Diego and Atlanta is a lot like Georgetown's early-season lineup of St. Leo's, 
Hawaii-Hilo and Hawaii Five-0. How far back have they really come? 
</P>
<P>
Joe Gibbs doesn't know the answer. But he does know the question: Does Gibbs 
still have it? 
</P>
<P>
After the 1988 season, he suggested that he might be fired, probably in the 
hope that owner Jack Kent Cooke would then reply that Gibbs was a great coach 
whom he would never fire. Cooke obliged. 
</P>
<P>
During this season, Gibbs has hinted that he might well quit, suggesting that 
it was in God's hands. There is a popular theory these days that coaches wear 
out after 10 years. John Madden went out on top after a decade. So did Bill 
Walsh. Unfortunately for Gibbs, who began in 1981, there's no TV gig in his 
future, unless CBN picks up pro football. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Gibbs looks just fine in comparison to his colleagues, many of 
whom have gone, well, nuts. There was Mike Ditka, who told the world his team 
stinks. There was Sam Wyche, who told the world that somebody else's team 
stinks. Jimmy Johnson claimed that Buddy Ryan was putting out bounties, and 
Ryan, well, what can you say about Ryan that Jimmy Johnson hasn't already? 
</P>
<P>
Ditka's Bears are a puzzle. And so are Ryan's Eagles. This is hardly an easy 
season to figure, particularly in the AFC where six teams have eight wins and 
two more have seven. Pete Rozelle should be happy. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins aren't happy. Happiness is, at a minimum, making the playoffs. But 
they like their new young offensive line. They like the way Rypien has 
responded. They like the fact that their schedule next season doesn't look too 
demanding. What they don't like is thinking about the Cowboys, about what might 
have been in 1989, and how it was that the season got away.

UC Irvine's 81-71 loss to Pepperdine Tuesday was another adventure in 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Irvine Coach Bill Mulligan promised a long night of film-watching 
for the Anteaters. Call it Late Night with UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
After a lackluster practice Monday, Mulligan issued an ultimatum: shape up or 
watch game films until 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the Anteaters left Pepperdine's Firestone Fieldhouse Tuesday night headed 
straight for the film room at Crawford Hall at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
It was hard to tell from the Anteaters which was worse, playing through their 
sixth loss in eight games or having to go watch it all over again. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we'll find out (what went wrong) when we watch the films until 3 
a.m.," Jeff Herdman said. "Probably, if we had played hard and still lost we 
wouldn't have to go watch films." 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters didn't play hard -- or very well, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
"What I used to do when I was at Long Beach Poly (High from 1958-64) was make 
them practice after a game if they won and didn't play hard," Mulligan said. 
"I've never had a team that's played this soft and had all the answers. I 
couldn't care less (about staying up all night). There's no school. It's good 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine played well in short spurts, especially in the second half, but the 
Anteaters lost for the fourth time in as many road games this season. Irvine 
stayed close to Pepperdine, despite its usual poor shooting and bad 
ballhandling. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters trailed, 35-28, at halftime although they shot 11 of 30 (36.7%) 
from the field. They also had eight turnovers. And Pepperdine didn't try to 
press the Anteaters, who started their fourth game in a row without point guard 
Rod Palmer, who has been sidelined with a sprained knee. 
</P>
<P>
Even a late appearance by Palmer, who was cleared to practice and play if he 
felt OK, couldn't save the Anteaters. Palmer played the final nine minutes and 
had two points and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
Twice, Irvine rallied in the second half only to see Pepperdine pull away. The 
second was the most frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine closed a 10-point gap to 66-61 on two free throws by Ricky Butler with 
2:44 left. But it all came unraveled quickly. 
</P>
<P>
After Herdman missed a short shot, Jeff Von Lutzow fouled Pepperdine center 
Geoff Lear. 
</P>
<P>
Herdman then got a technical foul protesting the call. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'We've been getting it all game. . . . ' " Herdman said. 
</P>
<P>
Lear, who had a game-high 25 points, made both free throws, then Shann Ferch 
made two free throws for the technical, and the Waves led, 70-61. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Irvine went on a 9-0 run to tie the score, 46-46, with 12:10 left. 
</P>
<P>
But Lear scored, was fouled and made the free throw. After Irvine's Dylan 
Rigdon made a free throw, Ferch made two free throws. Dexter Howard made two 
more, reserve guard Rick Welch hit a three-pointer and suddenly Pepperdine's 
lead was 56-47. 
</P>
<P>
"I've taken credit for some of these losses, but I'm not taking it for this 
one," Mulligan said. "We have no senior leadership and no junior leadership." 
</P>
<P>
Von Lutzow, a freshman, had his best game at Irvine, scoring 14 points. Herdman 
and Butler, both juniors, also had 14. 
</P>
<P>
Ferch had 17, Howard 12 and Doug Christie 11 for the Waves (3-3). 
</P>
<P>
Irvine began the game in frustrating fashion. 
</P>
<P>
On the Anteaters' first possession, Butler slipped around the defense for an 
easy layup, missed, then went over the back for a foul. 
</P>
<P>
On the next trip down the floor, Rob Doktorczyk missed a layup and was charged 
with a foul. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays, two missed layups, two fouls. It set the stage for another long 
night for the Anteaters. 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
No one was more encouraged by Rod Palmer's return than Rod Palmer. "I felt 
pretty good," said Palmer, who had been averaging 13 points when he injured his 
knee against Tennessee Chattanooga Dec. 2. "Hopefully, I get a little more 
playing time. It was a little stiff, but it felt good to be out there. I wish I 
could have got in a little earlier." . . . Former Mater Dei star Tom Lewis, 
nursing a dislocated finger, had just six points on two of nine shooting. 
"Lewis' finger is really bothering him," Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said. "His 
shot is way off."

SWISS CREATION KEEPS TIME, BUT PRICE TAG COULD STOP A CLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Time is money. But the bill usually doesn't run this high. 
</P>
<P>
The famed Swiss designer Gerald Genta is coming out with a new wristwatch that, 
more or less like an ordinary Swatch, tells time. Only it costs about $249,965 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Who in the world would want to buy a timepiece costing a quarter of a million 
dollars, even if it is an extremely rare and fancy Tourbillon Minute Repeater? 
"Someone who just doesn't want to be a me-too person and can afford it," said 
Stuart Barish, vice president of the New York distributor, Gerald Genta North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
"There's arrogance involved," he added, "but it's also ego and pride, so why 
not?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, aside from world poverty and other possible reasons, the band is simply 
leather, and the watch itself, unlike most in this price range, isn't studded 
with precious gems. It isn't even watertight. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you'd want to go swimming with it," Barish said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, you could buy a Volvo for what you'd save in New York city and state 
sales taxes alone by doing without the Genta creation. 
</P>
<P>
But none of that seems to have dampened interest in the watch, which is being 
touted as the most expensive "pure" watch -- in other words, one that isn't 
intended as jewelry -- ever made. Already, people are lining up to buy the 
first one, which is due to arrive in this country early next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The piece probably will be sold before it even gets in a case. We have a dozen 
prospects waiting to hold it in their hands," said Anthony D'Ambrosio, 
executive director of Tourneau, the New York dealer that has the right to sell 
the first Tourbillon Minute Repeater. 
</P>
<P>
"A quarter-million for a watch makes more sense to me than a $50-million 
painting," he added, when asked to explain why someone would want to spend 
$250,000 on a timepiece. If you use the watch for one year, that would be a 
little less than a penny a tick. 
</P>
<P>
The Swiss-made watches will be cranked out at the rate of two or so a year, and 
sometime in 1990 the Princess Ermine Jewels shop at the Beverly Hilton might 
have one to sell too. 
</P>
<P>
For the money, the buyer will get some special features. Made of more than 600 
parts, it can be set to chime every minute, every 15 minutes or at nearly any 
other interval. 
</P>
<P>
The watch also offers a perpetual calender, meaning that it makes automatic 
adjustments for months of varying lengths. In fact, one lever kicks in just 
once every four years, when Feb. 29 arrives on leap year. 
</P>
<P>
"It just works with gears and levers, the old-fashioned way," D'Ambrosio said. 
</P>
<P>
The device also is noted for its "skeleton" housing, which lets you see the 
parts inside. 
</P>
<P>
Genta, the designer, is part of the attraction too. "He works on the watch by 
hand and mind," Barish said. 
</P>
<P>
Genta is "the Picasso of watches," Barish boasted. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, promoters say that the watch should appeal to the wealthy collector 
who admires the best in pre-high-tech craftsmanship and artistry. 
</P>
<P>
The psychology of the buyer figures into the equation, too. David Stewart, a 
social psychologist who is a marketing professor at USC, said there always will 
be a market for ultra-expensive products as long as there are newly rich people 
"who are insecure in their new status in life and need the symbols of that 
status as a way of dealing with their insecurity."

JAMES FLANIGAN: BOEING KNOWS WHAT IT'S DOING OVERSEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Boeing, the Seattle-based master aircraft builder, is giving a lot of people 
jitters these days, even though the company itself remains calm and clear-eyed 
about world markets and the future. 
</P>
<P>
When Boeing announced recently that it would try to attract orders and go ahead 
with development of a new aircraft, to be called the 777, its stock dropped for 
three consecutive days on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Focusing near term as usual, stock market investors fear that development 
expenses for the new aircraft -- $4 billion, at least -- will hurt Boeing's 
current profits, which are due to rise sharply in the next few years as it 
delivers planes from its incredible backlog of $68 billion in orders for 737s, 
747s, 757s and 767s. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, when Boeing said it was discussing ways to share the 777's risks and costs 
with its Japanese suppliers -- Mitsubishi, Kawasaki and Fuji Heavy Industries 
-- the reaction from trade and foreign policy commentators was equally nervous. 
There were cries that Boeing was giving away its know-how, even though the 
three Japanese companies already subcontract on the 767. 
</P>
<P>
There were suggestions that Boeing would imperil its standing as the world's 
leading aircraft maker -- with 65% of the jetliners flying today -- if it 
brought in Japanese partners. 
</P>
<P>
So why is Boeing going ahead? Because it is looking to the late 1990s, when 
Asia will provide a market for a new plane to handle its explosion in air 
travel. It also knows that airlines in the U.S. market will need larger planes 
to accommodate more passengers through available airport slots. 
</P>
<P>
The envisioned 777 will be a two-engine, 350-seat plane with a wingspan 
adaptable enough to allow a range of 4,800 to 6,000 miles. Boeing is counting 
on that flexibility, plus a wider body and higher speed, to help it against 
similar planes that Europe's Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas will have 
on the market before the 777. 
</P>
<P>
Ties with Japanese subcontractors are likely to get closer, not looser, for the 
simple reason that Japan Air Lines and All Nippon Airways are among Boeing's 
best customers, taking a third to a half of the jumbo jets delivered in a given 
year. That's why Boeing subcontracts in Japan, just as it does in Italy and 
other countries that buy its planes. 
</P>
<P>
The deal on the new aircraft will go beyond subcontracting, possibly to an 
equity participation in which the Japanese companies would put up as much as $1 
billion, or 25% of the 777's development costs. 
</P>
<P>
And that sounds ominous to some. Rather than equity deals in Japan, suggests 
Clyde Prestowitz, author of "Trading Places," Boeing should turn for help to 
the U.S. government and form a consortium with U.S. aerospace companies. 
</P>
<P>
But that suggestion misses the point, says aerospace analyst Wolfgang Demisch, 
of UBS Securities. "It is not aircraft technology that is scarce, but access to 
markets. Having the market has always been important." Demisch points to a long 
history of European countries trying to field competitive aircraft 
manufacturers with too slight a home market to support them. Not until France, 
West Germany, Britain and Spain got together in the Airbus Industrie consortium 
did the European effort know any success. Airbus has emerged as Boeing's chief 
competitor. 
</P>
<P>
But the newly growing markets will be in Asia, with Japan leading off. A nation 
of 120 million people in a region of literally billions of people, Japan will 
lead a long-term travel boom that will make Asia a giant new home market. 
</P>
<P>
And that prospect has made Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
determined to get into the aircraft industry. MITI knows that value added in 
manufacturing aircraft is higher than in, say, shipbuilding. It's a matter of 
creating better jobs for Japanese workers, so it is a national purpose in 
Japan, where MITI has already given $80 million in development grants to 
Boeing's subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
Down the road will come a Japanese effort at a supersonic transport plane -- a 
21st Century project that may be something for the U.S. government and 
aerospace industry to think about. 
</P>
<P>
But Boeing knows that the 1990s, when world airlines will buy $400 billion 
worth of planes, will be crucial to its business. So it is going ahead with the 
new plane. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, development will be costly, but Boeing can handle it. The stock market's 
doubts don't reflect how strong the company is. As Boeing delivers planes from 
its backlog, its revenue in 1990 alone may jump 40% to $24.5 billion. Its 
profits next year, says analyst Phil Friedman of Drexel Burnham Lambert, could 
go to $1.3 billion or $5.50 a share, from $760 million or $3.30 in 1989 -- when 
it had a strike. The rising trend will continue until at least 1993, Freidman 
says, when Boeing could earn almost $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing, in fact, could afford to build the 777 alone. But that might only drive 
MITI to seek help from Europe's eager Airbus Industrie; it could surely hurt 
Boeing in the world's largest emerging market. 
</P>
<P>
So Boeing doesn't think that isolating itself is a way to lead world markets. 
Maybe that's why it's the largest U.S. exporter and, arguably, the most 
globally competitive American company.

CHENEY PROPOSES PRODUCTION CUT IN C-17 PROGRAM; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: IF APPROVED, THE MOVE WOULD BE A SETBACK FOR THE EXPANSION OF DOUGLAS 
AIRCRAFT'S LONG BEACH WORK FORCE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a move affecting the Southern California defense industry, Defense Secretary 
Dick Cheney has proposed cutting production of the Air Force's C-17 airlift 
plane from 10 aircraft to six next year, defense sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, if approved by the White House and Congress, would be a blow to 
Douglas Aircraft's plan to boost its 8,000-member Long Beach work force for the 
stepped-up production that had been planned earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated move that also cut into programs at the Long Beach plant, 
Douglas' parent firm, McDonnell Douglas Corp., announced Tuesday that 
management and production of its $4.5-billion T-45 Navy jet trainer program 
will be moved from Long Beach to the company's McDonnell Aircraft division in 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,800 of the Long Beach plant's 37,000 workers will be affected by the 
move. Most of them will remain employed at Long Beach, said a Douglas Aircraft 
spokesman, Richard Hill, but will be shifted to other military and commercial 
programs, including, ironically, the C-17 as well as the MD-80, MD-90 and MD-11 
commercial airliners. He said a undetermined -- but small -- number of Long 
Beach workers will be transferred to St. Louis in connection with the shift of 
the T-45 program. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said McDonnell Douglas had been aware of Cheney's proposal to cut 
production of the C-17. The decision on the T-45, he added, was "purely a 
business decision. It will allow us to concentrate our resources where they are 
most needed." 
</P>
<P>
The C-17s, which cost $178 million each, are designed to haul the Army's 
bulkiest weapons to crude airfields in faraway hot spots. Officials said that 
in trimming the C-17 program in his 1991 budget recommendations, Cheney has 
left open the option of scaling back the Air Force's planned purchase of 210 of 
the planes. 
</P>
<P>
At an estimated total cost of about $37.5 billion, the C-17 program is among 
the military's most expensive. It is, thus, an attractive target for cutbacks 
as the Pentagon prepares for tighter budgets and the diminishing Soviet bloc 
military threat. 
</P>
<P>
The C-17 airplanes might be further jeopardized by new intelligence estimates 
suggesting that the West would have as much as 90 days' warning of a Warsaw 
Pact military attack on Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
With that kind of warning, officials said, the United States could afford to 
reduce its reliance on fast but costly airplanes to move weapons and other 
material to fighting zones and to concentrate on building cheaper, but slower, 
transport ships. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the possibility of arms negotiations and further progress in East 
Bloc reforms have prompted Cheney and his senior advisers to order the 
preparation of a new assessment of the need for the C-17, according to several 
officials who have participated in early discussions about the plane's future. 
</P>
<P>
"It really depends on what we want our forces to look like" after arms 
negotiations, budget cutbacks and changes in Eastern Europe run their course, 
one senior defense official said. If the Army recasts itself into a lightly 
armed, fast-reaction force deployed primarily from the United States, the 
official said, there may still be a strong rationale for full production of the 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
With that decision still to come, Cheney has decided to set aside his often 
stated aversion to "stretching out" production runs -- Pentagonese for the 
practice of decreasing yearly production rates and planning a longer production 
period to complete a purchase of equipment. Cheney has said that the practice 
merely increases the cost of building weapons over the lifetime of a program. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas officials said the shift of the T-45 program to St. Louis, 
which will take place during the next several months, is intended to focus more 
effort on construction of large airframes at Douglas, where the company has a 
backlog of orders. The company said it expects some reduction in 
defense-related aircraft manufacturing at McDonnell's St. Louis plant in coming 
years, so it is moving the T-45 program there to help maintain production 
efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas won the Navy contract to develop and produce the T-45 
training system in November, 1981. The program calls for 300 aircraft, 32 
flight simulators, 49 computer-aided instructional devices, four mainframe 
computer facilities and 200 computer terminals. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of the jet training planes have been completed for the Navy's test 
program. 
</P>
<P>
In another blow to a Southern California defense firm, it was learned that 
Cheney has recommended ending production of the Maverick anti-tank missile by 
the end of fiscal year 1990, two years earlier than originally planned. In 
doing so, Cheney deleted Air Force and Navy requests of $350 million for the 
missiles, which are built at Hughes Aircraft Co.'s missile systems group in 
Canoga Park.

STOCK PROSPECTUS LIFTS VEIL OF SECRECY AT READER'S DIGEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Reader's Digest Assn., publisher of the world's most widely read magazine, on 
Tuesday issued the prospectus for its first stock offering and in so doing 
lifted a veil of secrecy that has hidden its inner financial workings for six 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
The prospectus for the sale of 25 million non-voting shares showed a publishing 
and direct-mail business that has undergone booming growth in recent years but 
that also saw profit growth abruptly slow in the fiscal year that ended last 
June. 
</P>
<P>
With annual revenue of about $1.83 billion, the association is controlled by a 
charitable trust and two funds set up by founders DeWitt Wallace, who died in 
1981, and Lila Wallace, who died in 1984. In 1922, the pair launched a magazine 
that grew to a current worldwide circulation of 28 million, mixing conservative 
politics and plain-spun humor. 
</P>
<P>
The underwriters of the offering, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Lazard Freres 
&amp; Co., expect that the non-voting Class A shares will be priced between $18 
and $22 apiece. At that valuation, the offering would be worth $450 million to 
$550 million. 
</P>
<P>
And assuming that the company's 20 million Class B voting shares are worth no 
less than the 124 million non-voting shares, the entire company would have a 
value of as much as $3.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The non-voting shares, which represent 21% of all common stock, will be sold by 
the two controlling funds and seven independent foundations set up earlier in 
the decade to support some of the Wallaces' favorite charities. Those 
foundations benefit, among others, Colonial Williamsburg, the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art in New York, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, 
and a conservation and preservation group called Scenic Hudson. 
</P>
<P>
The two controlling funds -- the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund and the 
Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund -- each own 10 million voting common shares, 
or 50% of the class. 
</P>
<P>
The firm said it was the foundations' wish to sell some shares to create a more 
active market for the securities, making it easier for shareholders to sell 
stock if they wish. Of the 25 million Class A shares to be sold, 21 million 
will be sold in the United States and the balance will be sold abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The prospectus for the securities, which will be sold in February, shows how 
the company has moved from a sole focus on its Reader's Digest and Reader's 
Digest Condensed Books lines to direct marketing of other books, specialty 
magazines, recorded music, videotapes and other merchandise. Among the 
specialty magazines are the Family Handyman, Travel Holiday and New Choices for 
the Best Years. 
</P>
<P>
The books and entertainment products now account for more than half of the 
business's total revenue and operating profits. 
</P>
<P>
After the death of Lila Wallace in 1984, the company's management embarked on a 
new strategy from its headquarters in suburban Westchester County, N.Y. It 
expanded operations while cutting costs, closing less profitable businesses and 
reducing its work force to a current 7,400 from 9,200. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1985 and 1988, net income grew an average of 40% a year, and pretax 
operating income increased by an average of 56% annually. 
</P>
<P>
Between fiscal 1988 and fiscal 1989, however, operating profit fell 3% to $207 
million and net income rose only 7% to $152 million. The company attributed the 
slowdown to a number of factors, including slower book sales, the addition of 
new money-losing magazines, and the increased costs from new compensation and 
profit-sharing plans. 
</P>
<P>
READER'S DIGEST ASSN. AT A GLANCE 
</P>
<P>
Based in Pleasantville, N.Y., the association is a major publisher and 
direct-mail marketer. Its flagship monthly, the Reader's Digest, is published 
in 39 editions in 15 languages, with a worldwide circulation of 28 million. In 
fiscal 1989, the magazine posted operating income of $62 million on revenue of 
$589 million, about 32% of the company's total. Direct-mail sales of books, 
recorded music and home video products generated $192 million in operating 
income on $1.09 billion in revenue, about 59% of the company's total. The 
association also publishes special interest magazines and assists school 
fund-raising campaigns.

Former Employer Sues Defense Firm: An engineer who quit his job at a Garden 
Grove defense contractor filed suit against the firm Tuesday, alleging that he 
was driven out because he blew the whistle on a scheme to defraud the 
government. John A. Trepl II contends that officials of Swedlow Inc. began to 
pressure him last year after he refused to cooperate in the firm's alleged 
scheme to cover up flaws in windshields it manufactured for the B-1B bomber. 
Trepl also said he alerted the FBI to the case. Swedlow and a vice president, 
Norman Gene Nixon, 53, have been indicted on four counts of making false 
statements to the government.

IBM Introduces Powerful New PC: International Business Machines Corp. announced 
the most powerful member of its Personal System/2 family of microcomputers, a 
model based on Intel Corp.'s i486 microprocessor. The PS/2 Model 70 486 is two 
to three times faster than systems using Intel's previous generation 386 chips. 
The new IBM computer is intended especially for users of numerically intensive 
applications, IBM said. The PS/2 Model 70 486 is available immediately and 
sells for $12,395 or $12,990. Introduction of the model apparently was made 
possible when Intel solved a problem with the i486 chip.

Imperial Corp. Has Negative Net Worth: Imperial Corp. of America said 
additional losses sustained by its already battered junk bond portfolio have 
resulted in a negative tangible net worth for the troubled San Diego-based 
parent company of Imperial Savings of California. Federal regulators have been 
fully informed of ICA's "capital deficiency" but there are no indications yet 
that regulators may seize control of the S&amp;L, ICA spokesman Bruce Dunn 
said. According to the minimum standards in the bill, ICA's core capital is 
supposed to equal at least $150 million, or 1.5% of its $10.5 billion assets. 
Dunn declined to specify what ICA's negative tangible net worth now totals.

LOOKING AHEAD: CHIEF EXECUTIVES WILL NEED GLOBAL VIEW IN THE 1990S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER G. VAJTA, PETER G. VAJTA is the director of the Los Angeles office of 
Arthur D. Little Inc., an international management and technology consulting 
firm headquartered in Cambridge, Mass.

<TEXT>
<P>
America's chief executive, President Bush, has gained considerable mileage from 
his vision of a "kinder, gentler nation." CEOs of American business, however, 
should prepare for a tougher, more turbulent marketplace in the decade ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The men and women who pilot American companies in the 1990s aren't likely to be 
any smarter or more ambitious than their current counterparts. But tomorrow's 
superior companies will be led by a new breed of chief executive -- one who is 
knowledgeable on global issues and their application to marketing strategy, is 
adept at anticipating change, acts swiftly and communicates those insights and 
actions to employees and shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Five major challenges confront the CEO of the '90s: 
</P>
<P>
Acting globally: In the '80s, only the brightest American corporate leaders 
considered the global market for their business. In the '90s, corporate leaders 
can't just think globally, they must act globally, and in every aspect of their 
businesses. In fact, CEOs who have not yet addressed the impact and 
opportunities of global markets in corporate planning are already lagging 
behind their competition. 
</P>
<P>
Many companies today pay lip service to being multinational when, in fact, they 
are actually a cluster of unrelated worldwide entities contributing to the same 
bottom line. To leverage off the global presence of their companies, CEOs must 
forge a unification of disparate company entities while recognizing the 
peculiarities of the individual markets. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacific Rim emerged in the '80s as a source of competition and a trove of 
opportunities for U.S. business. The unification of the European Community in 
1992 also presents comparable opportunities, to say nothing of a rapidly 
opening Eastern Europe. The smartest CEOs must thoroughly understand the 
cultural and business differences among -- and in -- each of these foreign 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
The best CEOs will recognize the potential of millions of consumers and vast 
raw materials in these markets. Thoroughly assessing foreign markets and 
developing new ways of doing business in foreign operations will be 
prerequisites for success. 
</P>
<P>
Using technology to gain competitive advantage: The implementation of 
information technology is changing the way companies operate today. However 
technology is used, it will play a critical role in a company's success or 
failure. CEOs must consider advanced technology not as an added luxury but as a 
necessity. 
</P>
<P>
Effectively competing in the global arena will require integrating technology 
into all aspects of a company's operations, with a corporate commitment to 
maintaining sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
Competing against non-traditional forces: Competition will emerge not only from 
foreign markets but also from the new companies formed by mergers and 
acquisitions. In addition, companies that were once customers may become 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
With few exceptions, industry leaders in the '90s will not be well served by 
competing on price alone. Quality -- in both products and services -- will 
become an essential way that companies will attempt to differentiate 
themselves. Many firms today have established mandates to improve quality at 
every level in the company. Motorola, Xerox and Westinghouse Electric, for 
example, have been nationally recognized for achieving progress through a 
top-down commitment to quality. 
</P>
<P>
Approaching the new labor force: The CEO's role as coach and manager will 
evolve in the next decade as he or she tries to direct, without dissuading, a 
new breed of manager that is more entrepreneurial in nature. As the corporate 
organizational structure of the '90s becomes increasingly flat, CEOs must be 
able to effectively direct fewer management levels with more multifunctional 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
The changing profile of the American family and the average life style will 
also necessitate how the CEO views the work force. The way that the CEO 
addresses such issues as child care, parental leave, flex-time schedules and 
fitness facilities will affect the loyalty of all ranks within organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Changing the profile of mergers and acquisitions: Mergers and acquisitions will 
continue, but progressive CEOs will increasingly look to those that enhance 
existing capabilities or provide access to new markets and services. As 
business leaders wisely move away from the "scorched earth" cost-cutting 
policies of the '80s, the measure of corporate financial performance will shift 
from short-term profit gains to the improvement of company and shareholder 
value created by strategically formed alliances. 
</P>
<P>
The most effective CEOs will be those who recognize the priority of identifying 
value in their companies. They will concentrate on profitable activities while 
reducing marginal business. They will set ambitious yet obtainable goals and 
will communicate their progress and optimism to the financial community and 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
To say that the role of the CEO in the '90s will be more difficult may be a 
gross understatement. What is certain is that corporate success will depend on 
the CEO's ability to adapt effectively to a rapidly changing business 
environment.

Medium of the Moment: Heritage Media Corp. is shifting its emphasis to in-store 
advertising from network television. Heritage, which owns TV and radio stations 
throughout the country, also holds 51% of POP Radio, which provides in-store 
programming for retailers that sounds like live radio, is targeted to shoppers' 
tastes and offers more store-specific advertising. If Heritage eventually buys 
POP Radio in a planned merger, it will be the dominant in-store advertising 
company and well on its way to deriving 60% of its revenue from that business. 
Why the shift? Because TV advertising is becoming less effective and in-store 
advertising is the medium of the moment. Dallas Morning News

IBMphasis: A survey by Computer Intelligence, a market research company, 
reveals that IBM still is the most popular PC with both large and small 
businesses. When asked about PC purchase plans, 3,000 of the 13,064 firms 
surveyed plan to buy at least one in the next year, and a significant 48% are 
leaning toward IBM. Apple, Compaq, Zenith and NCR each garnered less than 10% 
of the votes, while the remaining 28% of those planning to buy will go with 
other vendors, none of whom were mentioned by more than 2% of the respondents. 
Industries that will add the biggest numbers of PCs include medicine, 
education, government and manufacturing. Digital Review

East Bloc Business: One company tackling the obstacles to investment in Eastern 
Europe is McDonald's Canada, which has succeeded in erecting Golden Arches in 
the Soviet Union. Other companies interested in the Eastern Bloc would do well 
to look at McDonald's strategy, which included investing nearly $55 million in 
a food preparation center outside Moscow. Local farmers were recruited to 
supply milk, apples and meat, and McDonald's went so far as to introduce 
farmers to the potatoes that it wants grown. In case you'd like to make 
reservations, Big Mac makes its Moscow debut early next year. (London) Daily

Aluminum on the Rise: Aluminum ingot prices may soon turn around if alumina 
shortages continue as predicted. The price of alumina, the main ingredient in 
aluminum, is expected to rise as much as 45% in 1990, from $275 to $400 a ton, 
because of shortages precipitated by high aluminum production levels in the 
past two years. The rising alumina prices could cause some aluminum smelters to 
close, which is expected to cause an increase in aluminum ingot prices.

most productive offspring, and development of tougher, higher-yield crops. The

MAYOR ANGRILY DISPUTES REPORT OF OFFERING SPECIAL TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, angrily disputing a Times report that he offered 
preferential treatment to a personal friend and her business clients, declared 
Tuesday that the access given to Mary Anne Singer was no more sweeping than 
that accorded to hundreds of lobbyists and public relations executives. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you that there are hundreds of PR firms and representatives who 
have access and who are campaign contributors who are able to reach me," the 
mayor said at a City Hall press conference. 
</P>
<P>
"There are political lobbyists who are able to reach me. They do so because 
there has been a pattern that has been the principle of my office. I serve the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
The article in Tuesday's Times detailed how Singer, a 47-year-old contact lens 
technician, has used her connections to Bradley to build a small public 
relations business. At the same time, she was raising tens of thousands of 
dollars for Bradley's election drives. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, at 71 recently elected to a record fifth term, has been engulfed in 
controversy since spring because of his financial dealings. A federal grand 
jury recently convened to investigate possible violations of securities and 
public corruption laws by the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
According to Times sources in Tuesday's article, Singer had virtually 
unrestrained access to the mayor. "Nobody had access like Mary Anne," one 
former Bradley aide said. "Whatever she wanted, she got and she let people know 
it. If you said 'No' -- for whatever the request was -- Bradley would call. So 
you would just learn." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who had refused several requests for an interview before the article 
was published, similarly declined to discuss Tuesday any specifics about his 
relationship with Singer. Singer, too, has declined to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
But in questions posed after a news conference on homeless programs, Bradley 
angrily answered, "No, no, no, no," when asked if Singer had special access. 
</P>
<P>
He also criticized The Times for publishing the article, calling it a 
"non-story." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor repeatedly sought to frame his connection to Singer as part of a vast 
network of associates he maintains, and not as a special and isolated case. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether it is somebody that I've known for 20 years or someone that I know 
only by virtue of a phone call, I try to respond to their needs," Bradley said, 
"and I believe that is the function of an elected official." 
</P>
<P>
"I try to provide the kind of case-by-case evaluation so that whatever my 
response is in connection with that inquiry, that is not something that is 
improper or illegal." 
</P>
<P>
"I immediately go to work to try to get somebody to take some sort of action," 
the mayor said. "I think the process in far too many cases is much too 
cumbersome."

BRADLEY POLITICAL CARNIVALS RAISE LEGAL DOUBTS; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGNS: STATE LAWS AND CITY POLICY MAY HAVE BEEN VIOLATED BY THE MAYOR'S 
FUND-RAISING ACTIVITIES. HE REFUSES TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT 1987 AND '88 
EVENTS. 
</P>

<P>
A series of fund-raising carnivals for Mayor Tom Bradley's 1989 reelection 
campaign may have violated state campaign laws as well as a city policy that 
prohibits the use of public land for political purposes, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
City and state officials said the staging of the carnivals and the handling of 
the proceeds could pose a number of problems for the mayor's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
At least two carnivals were held on city-owned property in South-Central Los 
Angeles before proper permits were issued and without the required approval of 
the City Council, records show. Also, the Bradley campaign may have failed to 
disclose the true source of the carnival proceeds on campaign reports, said 
Jules Glazer, the mayor's campaign accountant. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the state Fair Political Practices Commission declined to 
comment on the Bradley carnivals. But, she said, if the sources of political 
contributions are concealed, that could constitute "laundering" of funds and a 
violation of state law. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported Tuesday that the carnivals were coordinated by two Bradley 
political supporters -- Mary Anne Singer, a contact lens technician who runs a 
small public relations firm out of her Beverly Hills apartment, and her 
one-time client, Long Beach businessman Allen Alevy. The carnivals were held on 
inner-city lots in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time that the carnivals were generating money for his campaign, the 
mayor was personally intervening at City Hall to help Alevy purchase city 
property, where at least two of the carnivals were held. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley walked out of a news conference Tuesday when he was questioned about 
the carnival fund-raising operation. Later, Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani said 
Bradley had not known that the carnivals were run on city property. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said the mayor on Tuesday ordered an overall 
review of the fund-raising carnivals by his staff. Chandler said the office 
would have "no further comment" on the carnivals. Alevy and Singer also have 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising officials for the mayor were unable to say how many carnivals were 
held or how much money they produced for the mayor's campaign, in part because 
money raised by Alevy and Singer were handled outside normal campaign reporting 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
The carnival contributions will be examined by the city clerk's office as part 
of an ongoing audit of the mayor's political fund-raising, said City Clerk 
Elias Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office said it will wait for results of the audit before 
deciding whether to take action. 
</P>
<P>
Under a written policy, the city has not allowed political fund-raising on city 
property because "once you open it up for anything, you open it up for 
everything," Senior Assistant City Atty. George Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
Two council members criticized the Bradley campaign for holding fund-raisers on 
city property. 
</P>
<P>
"I would think we ought to look into it and find out who gave them permission 
to use city property," said Council President John Ferraro, who was defeated by 
Bradley in 1985. "You're not supposed to use city property for political 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said, "Clearly, it is inappropriate . . . That's no 
different than holding a fund-raiser in a City Hall office." 
</P>
<P>
City records show that 11 carnivals were sponsored by "The Committee to 
Re-elect Tom Bradley." The Times has obtained copies of money orders totaling 
$20,000, which represent a portion of the total gate receipts funneled to the 
mayor's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Singer served as a liaison between Alevy, Bradley and the mayor's reelection 
campaign, according to four sources. The sources said, among other things, that 
Singer helped coordinate the scheduling of the carnivals. 
</P>
<P>
Alevy arranged the carnivals through Ross Phipps, a Wilmington-based carnival 
booking agent. Alevy solicited Bradley supporters to donate land for his 
events, including Boys Markets, developer Wayne Ratkovich and parking lot 
operator Joe Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
"He was pretty strongly indicating he was connected to the mayor," said Neil 
Torrence of the downtown architectural firm of Albert C. Martin and Associates. 
Torrence said he allowed a vacant lot northwest of downtown to be used three 
times for Bradley carnivals. 
</P>
<P>
One landowner said he received a call from Alevy about two years ago to host a 
carnival that would raise funds for the mayor. Alevy said he was "a friend of 
the mayor" and, "If you'd like me to have the mayor call you, I will," said the 
landowner, who supports the mayor and asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
That night, the owner said, he received a call from Bradley, verifying that 
Alevy was arranging carnivals for the campaign. The carnival was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
At least two of the carnivals were conducted without proper approval on land 
owned by the city near Avalon and Martin Luther King Jr. boulevards, according 
to city records. 
</P>
<P>
Alevy said "he owned the lot," according to Phipps. In fact, Alevy was 
attempting to acquire the narrow vacant lot, records show, but it was still 
city property when the Bradley carnivals were held in September, 1987, and 
February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
City records also show that permits for several of the mayor's carnivals were 
not approved by the Police Commission until weeks after the events were held. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Richard Rudell said he cracked down on a number of carnival 
operators, including those putting on Bradley's events, because requirements to 
ensure public safety and give advance public notice were bypassed. 
</P>
<P>
The Bradley campaign received a 20% share of the income from the rides, or 
between $3,000 and $5,000 for a typical five-day run, said Phipps. Cashier's 
checks would be made out to the Bradley committee and delivered to Alevy, 
Phipps said. 
</P>
<P>
Alevy, in turn, would send money orders and cashier's checks directly to 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"He did not come through the normal fund-raising operation," said Glazer, the 
mayor's campaign accountant. 
</P>
<P>
Glazer said Bradley instructed his staff to report the carnival contributions 
as miscellaneous small donations in the amount of $5 and $10, meaning the names 
of donors did not need to be disclosed under the law. 
</P>
<P>
For such small donations, the campaign must prove that those individuals knew 
they were contributing to a political campaign, said Sandra Michioku, 
spokeswoman for the state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
However, people buying tickets at the Bradley carnivals would not have known 
they were benefiting the mayor, said several carnival operators and employees. 
"Not unless they had some connection to the (Bradley) committee," said Sharie 
Davis, one of the carnival operators. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Kirstensen, a manager for Davis, said there were no Bradley signs at an 
October, 1988, carnival which city records show was a Bradley fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Phipps also said the carnivals were not identified as Bradley 
fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
Later, after The Times questioned Alevy about the lack of identification, 
Phipps said he "forgot a couple of things" and volunteered that he had placed 
Bradley signs on ticket booths at Alevy's insistence. 
</P>
<P>
Glazer acknowledged in an interview last week that the campaign could have 
erred in the accounting of the carnival contributions. 
</P>
<P>
If the Bradley carnivals were not properly identified as fund-raisers, the 
landowners and the carnival organizers would be the donors, Michioku said. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler said Tuesday that the carnival funds were reported properly. He also 
said that, according to a campaign official, signs were placed on ticket booths 
indicating the carnivals were for Bradley. He declined to name the official or 
say how the official knew the signs were posted. 
</P>
<P>
The carnival fund-raisers came at the same time Bradley was working behind the 
scenes to help Alevy acquire two block-long parcels of surplus city land on 
East Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. -- without competitive bidding. Alevy wanted 
the land to build two small shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
One carnival in March, 1987, for example, was held only days before Councilman 
Gilbert Lindsay -- at the mayor's request -- introduced a motion recommending 
that Alevy be sold one of the parcels. Thirteen months later, Alevy bought the 
land for $185,000. 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, Alevy met with Bradley at City Hall on the day one of his 
four-day carnivals ended, according to the mayor's appointment calendar. Within 
a week, records show, the second vacant city parcel was put up for sale, 
eventually leading to a recommendation by city real estate officials that it be 
sold to Alevy. City financial analysts last May rejected the sale, however, 
saying it was not in the public interest because a higher price could possibly 
be obtained by putting the property up for auction.

GRINCHES DON'T WIN THIS TIME;

AID FLOWS IN TO REPLACE FAMILY'S STOLEN CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An unexpected blizzard of Christmas cheer fell Tuesday upon an impoverished 
South-Central Los Angeles family whose home was cleaned out by thieves while 
the mother visited her young, cancer-stricken daughter at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The two police officers who were flagged down by a distraught Blanche Griffin 
after she found her West 85th Street home looted of clothing, food and wrapped 
Christmas gifts reached into their own pockets and immediately purchased $100 
worth of replacement toys for her five children. 
</P>
<P>
Actor Henry Winkler dispatched a $1,000 check and a personal letter to the 
family to express his dismay at the Scrooge-like attack, which left Griffin, 
34, with an empty closet and her children with only the clothes on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin's landlord quickly found a new house for her to move into. And workers 
from AT&amp;T volunteered to install a free security alarm system in it to 
protect the family in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan telephoned Griffin to offer his best wishes for 
her 9-year-old daughter's recovery and to promise his assistance in replacing 
household goods that were spirited off early Monday while Griffin and three of 
her children visited ailing Vernika Griffin at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday night, new clothing, toys, canned food and more than $3,500 in cash 
had been dropped off for the family at the Los Angeles Police Department's 77th 
Street Division station. 
</P>
<P>
"People have just opened their hearts," said Sgt. Art Ficke, whose office was 
serving as a clearinghouse for the donations. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin was in tears as some of the toys were delivered to Vernika at the 
hospital by firefighters and police officers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a miracle," said Griffin, a single mother who moved with four of her 
children from Arkansas to Los Angeles two years ago to work as a domestic. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought my family would not be able to enjoy this Christmas. I thought it 
would be a disaster because we had spent all of the money we had on clothes and 
toys and it was all gone." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Griffin had been surprised by Reagan's telephone call when she visited 
the police station to thank Officers Juan Santos and Kevin Becker for the toys 
they had purchased. 
</P>
<P>
The former President said he had been moved by news reports of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
"You could see the desperation on her face when she ran out and flagged us 
down," Santos said of Griffin. "People had been watching her house, and they 
knew she went to the hospital every day to visit her little sick girl." 
</P>
<P>
Her plight was familiar to Santos, 39. The eight-year veteran said he grew up 
the son of a New York minister whose home was frequently burglarized Sunday 
mornings by thugs who knew the family would be at church. 
</P>
<P>
Santos and Becker discovered that about $1,200 worth of gifts had been 
purloined from Griffin's house -- including a battery-powered toy police 
motorcycle, a blackboard and a stereo set. 
</P>
<P>
The gifts were for Vernika and Griffin's son Donta, 12, and other daughters, 
Tasha, 8, and Alicisa, 2. Another son, Steven, 16, lives with Griffin's mother 
in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
As gifts and cash poured in Tuesday, Becker promised Griffin that police will 
use the money to purchase replacement clothing and household goods so she is 
not disqualified from Medi-Cal payments that are covering Vernika's 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
At the hospital, Vernika clutched a check for $250 donated by hospital workers, 
and hugged her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"Momma, why are you crying?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Carole Hurvitz, director of the children's cancer treatment program at the 
hospital, said Vernika -- and her family -- have won the hearts of doctors and 
nurses because of their daily visits over the 20 weeks that the girl has been a 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
Vernika's condition is guarded, Hurvitz said. Cancer that started in the girl's 
brain last year has spread to her spine. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to get her home in time for Christmas, but she'll have to come back 
again next week for more chemotherapy," Hurvitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Griffin: "It's going to be our best Christmas ever."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YAROSLAVSKY OPPOSES PERMANENT ETHICS PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said Tuesday that he thinks a 
permanent city ethics commission would be too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said he agreed that an ethics panel, as proposed by a blue-ribbon 
panel appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley, is needed. But he dismissed as "out of 
the question" a plan to give the commission authority to hire lawyers to 
conduct investigations without approval of the city attorney or the council. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen enough $3 (million), $4 million bills from private attorneys," 
Yaroslavsky said. "No department in the city of Los Angeles has a call on the 
city's general fund in this way," he said. "(Police Chief) Daryl Gates, who has 
a much more serious problem to deal with than the ethics commission will ever 
have to deal with, doesn't have the right to call on the general fund for 
unlimited sums of money to police gang violence."

"We think we've done the only thing left for us to do," said Walt Keller, 
co-chairman of the Malibu Committee for Incorporation which, with the Malibu 
Township Council, filed the Superior Court complaint. It accuses the 
supervisors of violating a state law that gives them 60 days from the time they 
begin hearing a cityhood matter to conclude the hearing, before setting an 
election in another 30 days. The supervisors took up the issue Oct. 19, and 
voted 4 to 1 last month to postpone a decision until construction permits are 
issued for a Malibu sewer system the county wants to build.

OFFICIALS DEFEND BOARD'S INACTION ON OBSTETRICIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
State officials on Tuesday defended the California Board of Medical Quality 
Assurance in the wake of the nine second-degree murder convictions of Dr. Milos 
Klvana, a Valencia obstetrician whom the board investigated but did not 
discipline in the deaths of some of the babies that figured in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"I see nothing to apologize for in terms of our efforts," said Kenneth J. 
Wagstaff, the board's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Wagstaff released a statement Tuesday that called his agency's investigations 
of Klvana "unusually difficult" and said that "no governmental agency, no 
matter how large or powerful, can ever guarantee that bad medical practice will 
not occur." 
</P>
<P>
But others, including the prosecutor in the Klvana case, remained skeptical of 
the board's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"The system allowed him to get away with it," said Brian R. Kelberg, chief of 
the medical-legal section of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury convicted Klvana, 49, of nine 
counts of second-degree murder in the deaths of eight infants and a fetus 
between 1982 and 1986. The prosecution charged that the deaths resulted because 
Klvana, who operated out-of-hospital birth clinics in Valencia and Temple City, 
was incompetent and ill-equipped to handle high-risk deliveries, but proceeded 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation that led to Klvana's 1986 arrest and Monday's convictions was 
triggered by the 1984 death of baby Jason Friel. But state medical board 
officials acknowledged that they knew of Klvana's involvement in four earlier 
infant deaths, investigated the cases but took no action against his license. 
</P>
<P>
Kelberg said the case exposed flaws in the board's system of monitoring the 
competence of doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Wagstaff responded Tuesday by defending the board's system of using panels of 
physicians and medical consultants to investigate complaints of incompetence 
against doctors. 
</P>
<P>
"I have confidence in the system," Wagstaff said. "I think the average person 
should have confidence in the system. The fact is unfortunately that every 
system can be sidestepped, ducked and in some cases manipulated." 
</P>
<P>
The board was hampered in its probe of Klvana by a variety of factors, 
including the doctor's skill at misleading investigators and falsifying medical 
records, a reluctance by some parents to cooperate with medical authorities and 
a dearth of solid information about the deaths at the time they occurred, said 
California Deputy Atty. Gen. Linda J. Vogel. She represented the board in the 
Klvana case. 
</P>
<P>
The first death of a baby in Klvana's care that came to the board's attention 
was that of Amy Johnson on Christmas Day, 1982. The board interviewed the 
parents but were not told of several important details of Klvana's substandard 
care until more than two years later, after the district attorney's 
investigation of him was well under way, Vogel said. 
</P>
<P>
In another case, the 1983 death of Amanda Herrera, the mother said Klvana 
administered a labor-inducing drug outside of a hospital setting; Klvana denied 
using the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Without evidence to corroborate the mother's story, an investigative panel of 
two doctors looking into the case said they believed "we would not be able to 
bring medical evidence to dispute what Klvana was saying," Wagstaff said. 
</P>
<P>
But Kelberg said this case demonstrated that the board's investigations are 
tainted by a collegiality that "calls for this automatic acceptance of what the 
doctor says and a belief that the patient must be mistaken." 
</P>
<P>
Klvana's own attorney, Richard A. Leonard, said the board failed to realize 
that Klvana had "a motive to lie and fabricate. He (wanted) to protect that 
(medical) license." 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 death of Aaron Diederick also was reported to the medical board. 
Wagstaff's statement said the board's probe merged into the investigation begun 
by the Los Angeles County district attorney later that year after the death of 
Jason Friel. 
</P>
<P>
Klvana's license currently is under a court injunction the board obtained 
earlier this year, after Klvana was found to have been practicing medicine 
while out on bail. The injunction effectively bars him from practicing 
medicine, Vogel said.

POLICE PROBE ABDUCTIONS OF 2 MORE WOMEN; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: KIDNAPINGS IN WEEK NOW TOTAL FOUR. AUTHORITIES DOUBT THAT THEY ARE 
CONNECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Authorities on Tuesday were investigating the abductions of two more Los 
Angeles-area women -- one of whom was sexually assaulted and killed -- bringing 
to four the number of local women kidnaped in less than a week. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives, however, said the cases probably are not related. Descriptions of 
suspects provided by witnesses have varied, as have the suspects' methods and 
weapons used. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, detectives said they do not believe that the spate of cases 
represents an upturn in violent sexual attacks or abductions which, at least in 
Los Angeles, have declined statistically in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"If you saw the reports we get daily, these kinds of occurences, unfortunately, 
happen all the time," observed Detective Steve Laird, a Los Angeles Police 
Department sex crimes investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Laird noted, perhaps ironically, that sexual assaults in Los Angeles tend to 
decline during December. 
</P>
<P>
It was last Friday when Irene Franco, 20, was abducted from a Carson drive-in 
theater by three armed men who beat her boyfriend and then raped and murdered 
her. The suspects remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent abduction occurred about 4 a.m. Tuesday, when a man driving a 
van offered a ride to two young women walking in the 2400 block of Pacific 
Coast Highway in Wilmington, said Lt. Mike Markulis of the LAPD's Harbor 
station. 
</P>
<P>
Markulis said the man grabbed one of the women and handcuffed her to the 
steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
When the other woman, Zennie Joanna McGowan, 23, of Long Beach, ran from the 
van, the suspect chased McGowan, trapped her against a chain-link fence, and 
beat her with a padlock and chain that was hanging from the fence gate. 
</P>
<P>
The woman handcuffed to the steering wheel -- whom McGowan identified as either 
Michele Thomas or Michele Thompson, 24, of Carson -- has not been seen since, 
nor has the van, which Markulis described as a light blue Ford or Dodge. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was described as white, about 35 years of age, 5 feet, 7 inches, 
and 140 pounds. He had long dark hair, a dark mustache and was wearing 
eyeglasses. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Los Angeles police detectives in the Wilshire area were looking for 
two men in last week's kidnaping, sexual assault and slaying of a Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center filing clerk whose body was found Friday afternoon in a vacant 
lot behind a church in the 5700 block of Rodeo Road. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Johnson, 25, was last seen alive at about 11:30 p.m. Thursday, when she 
left work at Cedar's Comprehensive Cancer Center, where she had worked for 
three months, according to hospital spokesman Ron Wise. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they believe that after shooting the woman once in the head and 
dumping her body, her attackers went to Inglewood to burglarize her home. 
There, at about 1:30 a.m. Friday, they encountered her husband, Charles Johnson 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, an Army recruiter, tried to run outside to call police, but was shot 
several times in the torso. He died at a nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Police said detectives were able to put the two homicide cases together when 
Mrs. Johnson's father filed a missing persons report with Inglewood police 
after the slaying of his son-in-law. Los Angeles detectives, monitoring 
teletype messages between police departments, recognized the missing woman's 
description as being that of Mrs. Johnson, whose body initially could not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Johnson's car was found abandoned Saturday in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Dan Andrews said there did not appear to be any connection between 
the Johnson homicides and the slaying of Irene Franco. 
</P>
<P>
"There were different calibers of guns used, different parts of county, 
different methods," Andrews said. "Although we are keeping an open mind, there 
is nothing at this point to link anything together." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators were still searching for 
clues in Monday's abduction of a 33-year-old Bassett woman. 
</P>
<P>
The woman and her husband, 34, were in their car in a park in the City of 
Industry when two gunmen forced the husband out and drove off with the woman. 
She was released unharmed about an hour later and 12 miles away in San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
The couple's car, a 1988 white Thunderbird, license plate 2KHY059, was still 
missing on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
And, in Orange County, Garden Grove homicide detectives continued searching for 
a stolen car that they believe may lead them to the assailant who raped and 
killed a 30-year-old Fountain Valley woman on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Hong Thi Nyugen, was shot in the head after being sexually 
assaulted. Her white Toyota MR2 was missing and apparently stolen.

A man killed last week at the side of drug kingpin Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha has 
been identified as one of the lieutenants of the powerful Medellin cocaine 
cartel, police said. Authorities initially thought the man was one of the 
bodyguards slain during a gun battle with police at a coastal ranch. But Luz 
Mary Celades, the wife of Rodriguez Gacha, identified the body as that of 
Gilberto Rendon Hurtado, reportedly the No. 8 man in the cartel. Rendon Hurtado 
was wanted for extradition to the United States, but he was not on the 
so-called dirty dozen list of top drug traffickers wanted by the U.S.

El Salvador's leftist guerrillas have admitted for the first time that hundreds 
of their number have been killed in their five-week-old offensive. Radio 
Venceremos, the guerrillas' mouthpiece, said 401 fighters of the Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front have been killed, among them a high-ranking 
officer named Dimas Rodriguez. The government estimates that up to half of the 
6,000 to 10,000 rebels have been killed or wounded.

A former minister in the pro-Soviet Afghan government defected to the 
resistance and said he had worked secretly in Kabul for the guerrillas for 
almost 10 years. Pacha Gul Wafatar, recently the minister of civil aviation, 
was interviewed in Peshawar, Pakistan, after he fled Kabul. He said he had been 
advised by one of the guerrilla factions to depart the capital because of the 
possibility of a coup attempt. He was one of the most senior officials to 
switch sides in the conflict.

The wife of a Japanese member of Parliament said she is so fed up with the 
leadership of her husband's ruling party that she will run for election on an 
independent ticket. Makiko Hamada, 47, wife of Takujiro Hamada, a Liberal 
Democratic member of the lower house, said she has had enough of money 
politics, which have embroiled the party in its biggest scandal in more than 30 
years. The scandal, in which the Recruit Co. communications conglomerate handed 
out unlisted shares to gain political influence, eventually brought down Prime 
Minister Noboru Takeshita.

Three incendiary bombs have been found in major downtown San Francisco 
department stores since the holiday shopping season began, police disclosed. 
None of the devices exploded. It is not known if there is any connection 
between the three incidents, Police Officer David Ambrose said. The latest 
incident was over the weekend at The Emporium, where a bomb was found by a 
store employee in a box under a rug after moving a sofa in the area, police 
said. On Nov. 25, a bomb was found in a package at the I. Magnin store, and 
another was found on Dec. 14 at Macy's. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms is also investigating, Ambrose said.

Pesticides in runoff farm water may be a key factor in the sharp decline of 
striped bass in the Sacramento River, state scientists reported. Staff of the 
Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board said in a report circulated 
among government agencies that they have detected levels of pesticides that are 
lethal or toxic to tiny animals in the striped bass food chain. The pesticides 
are carbofuran, ethyl parathion and malathion. "Pesticides in rice discharge 
water may be responsible, in part, for the decline in size of the striped bass 
population in the Sacramento-San Joaquin (rivers) Delta," the report said. 
Scientists noted that striped bass production in the delta is at an all-time 
low. Responding to the report, Brian Finlayson, supervisor of the state 
Department of Fish and Game's pesticide unit, said more scientific studies are 
needed to prove that farm chemicals are to blame. Water diversions and other 
factors may have much to do with the decline, he said.

The automobile license plate of Bay Area earthquake victim Buck Helm will be on 
public display soon, and his former wife says she hopes it will serve as a 
symbol to "give others strength against all odds to hold on." Helm, 58, a 
longshoreman from Weaverville, was found alive after being trapped in his car 
for 90 hours amid the rubble of the section of Interstate 880 in Oakland that 
collapsed in the Oct. 17 temblor. He died on Nov. 18 in an Oakland hospital. 
Lorene Helm, the victim's former wife, announced that the family was donating 
the California license plate to Ripley's Believe It Or Not for display at the 
organization's museum at San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf. "We hope that 
Buck's story of survival in a time of desperation will be told over and over 
again," Lorene Helm said.

ROMANIANS: In 1982, Daniel Branzai lost his Romanian citizenship over alleged 
anti-government activities. . . . Today, he's the pastor of the 200-member 
Romanian Baptist Church in Anaheim, site of a prayer service this Friday night 
for those killed in last weekend's Romanian protests (A1). "We want change, but 
without shedding of blood," says Branzai, who recently re-entered his homeland 
for the first time since 1982. . . . Orange County is home to 15,000 Romanian 
emigrants, Branzai says. Dana Parsons and Mark I. Pinsky

CSU BOARD HEAD ADMITS FUDGING ON AA DEGREE 
</P>

The chairwoman of the California State University trustees misstated her 
academic credentials when she told the governor's office and the state Senate 
that she had received an Associate of Arts degree in literature from Long Beach 
City College in 1959, she acknowledged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Marianthi Lansdale -- a Huntington Beach resident and Orange County patron of 
the arts who is married to developer William M. Lansdale, a generous political 
supporter of Gov. George Deukmejian -- conceded to The Times that she had never 
received her community college degree, although she listed the degree and a 
1959 graduation date when the governor nominated her to the prestigious board 
in 1985. She was unanimously confirmed by the state Senate for a term that 
expires in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
As chairwoman, Lansdale heads a 24-member board charged with making policy 
decisions for one of the largest public four-year university systems in the 
world. Lansdale selects colleagues to serve on special committees, chairs board 
meetings six times a year and helps set the tone in salary negotiations with 
the system's 19,200 faculty members. The board chair is rotated among members, 
who elect the presiding officer for a one-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach City College records show that Lansdale attended the school for 13 
semesters between 1957 and 1967 -- eight years past the date of her claimed 
graduation. Lansdale said she took night courses because she was a working 
mother struggling to raise a child and put her first husband through college. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lansdale said she accumulated the 60 credits needed for the AA degree, 
she acknowledged Tuesday that she never received the formal degree because she 
lacked a required course in either geography or history. The 1959 graduation 
date is also included on the current official CSU information sheet for 
Lansdale. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what? I never thought anybody would write a story or cared or it 
mattered," she said Tuesday. "It wasn't like I lied about a traffic infraction 
or a felony or a fraud. I'm just a good solid citizen, and I never thought I 
would be living in a fishbowl." 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale, 57, said Tuesday that she "doesn't care" that she misstated her 
educational background, emphasizing that she received credits "equivalent" to 
an AA degree. She also blamed the misrepresentation on her part to confusion 
and the fact that she is unaccustomed to filling out application forms. 
</P>
<P>
"People who read your article don't even care. You know that?" she said. "I 
think they ought to be proud a working mother attended and found the time and 
ability to attend school at night." 
</P>
<P>
But Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) said Tuesday that 
Lansdale should step down. Had the Senate known that she misrepresented her 
educational credentials, she would not have been confirmed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes to the heart and substance of what she does on the board," he said. 
"The board . . . in effect sets the value of the degree and to falsify your own 
degree information is intolerable." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Deukmejian said Tuesday the governor's office was checking into 
whether Lansdale's education claims were subjected to a background check before 
being sent on to the Senate as part of the confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale told The Times early Tuesday that she would release her Long Beach 
City College transcripts to clear up any questions about her community college 
education, but she changed her mind later in the day and said she would keep 
her records confidential. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale was appointed to the state university board after she and her husband, 
through their Long Beach development company, gave more than $95,000 and the 
use of a corporate aircraft to Deukmejian's 1982 campaign, public records show. 
Board members do not receive a salary, but are paid $100 a day and expenses for 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview last week, Lansdale acknowledged that her nomination to the CSU 
board in 1985 surprised her, especially since she had not attended a four-year 
institution and did not have a bachelor's degree. She also said that her 
political activity was a factor in prompting the governor to make the 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked diligently and hard in raising money for the governor," Lansdale 
said. "This is his way of saying, 'You did a good job and this is a prestigious 
appointment and you're going to do a good job.' That's just the ABCs of the 
political world." 
</P>
<P>
She added: "If I were governor, would I appoint somebody out of the phone book? 
Heck no. I would say, 'This person has been strongly supportive of me and I 
know them, know them to be honest people.' " 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale and her husband also have given generously to many civic and cultural 
endeavors in Long Beach and Orange County. They are active in the Long Beach 
symphony, the Long Beach Civic Light Opera, the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center and the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana. She is also active in cultural 
affairs in Palm Springs, where she maintains a second residence and is 
registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
CSU Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds said Tuesday that the lack of a college degree 
has not dimmed Lansdale's enthusiasm or ability to serve as a trustee, for 
which there is no educational requirement. She said the misrepresentations by 
Lansdale "do not bother me" and that trustees cannot be held to the same 
standards as university employees, who can be fired if found to be falsifying 
academic credentials.

A spokesman for Southern California Edison was on one line, a needy family on 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Both seemed hesitant to talk, but they got over it after talking for about two 
minutes," Irvine Temporary Housing's Louise Wagner said. "Now, it turns out, 
the children in the family are all excited. They get to go for a ride in one of 
Edison's big trucks." 
</P>
<P>
This week, Wagner is once again playing matchmaker, just as she does each year 
during the holidays. She is in charge of Adopt A Family for Christmas 1989, her 
third year coordinating the program. 
</P>
<P>
"Businesses, families and individuals all play a part. The Soroptomists have 
called and are taking three families, Alderwood Basics Plus (an Irvine 
elementary school) is taking seven families, the Chamber of Commerce is 
involved, our high schools, the Irvine Medical Center. There are about 45 
families we are placing this year," Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Temporary Housing rents 10 apartments and two houses in the city to 
needy families, based on their ability to pay. Each of these families will also 
be adopted in the Christmas program. Their identities remain secret to save 
them from embarrassment, Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our 12 families always remain anonymous, as do many of the people involved in 
the Adopt a Family program," Wagner said. "Many people, on both sides of this 
program, simply prefer it that way. They bring food, gifts and sometimes 
clothing here and families come to pick it up." 
</P>
<P>
Others find out specific sizes for children and custom fit their donations. 
</P>
<P>
"It just depends on how each individual wants to handle it," Wagner said. 
"Sometimes we just give out phone numbers and they work it out outside the 
program." LEN HALL

BUENA PARK MAN ARRESTED IN STABBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police arrested a Buena Park man Tuesday on suspicion of murder in the stabbing 
of an Anaheim man, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police took Pablo Gomez, 25, into custody on the Santa Ana Freeway in 
Buena Park early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Fred Roush said detectives made the arrest a few hours after Gilberto 
Hernandez Pineda, 18, died from stab wounds at Western Medical Center-Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Police and paramedics found Pineda bleeding from the chest in the 800 block of 
South Claudina Street, Roush said. The incident occurred around 3 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics treated Pineda on the scene before taking him to the hospital. 
Pineda died around 12:05 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tip, Roush said, police stopped a vehicle driven by Gomez on the 
freeway after a two-hour search. 
</P>
<P>
"The suspect was arrested without incident," Roush said. 
</P>
<P>
He said police are still trying to determine the motive for the stabbing.

MORE NORTH COUNTY MEDFLY DOUSING DUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State officials on Tuesday scheduled two more aerial pesticide sprayings in 
January for the North County neighborhoods that surround a guava tree in Brea 
where a Mediterranean fruit fly was trapped last month. 
</P>
<P>
Parts of La Habra, Fullerton and Brea, covering about nine square miles in 
Orange County, will be doused by helicopter with a mixture of malathion and 
insect bait on the nights of Jan. 2 and Jan. 22, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the third and fourth sprayings for most of the the Orange County 
region since late November. The area could be hit as many as a dozen times 
through the summer as part of the state's new multiple-spraying policy, aimed 
at containing a problem that scientists say could be out of control. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of a schedule for sprayings through January held no surprises, 
but it could help to reduce some complaints from residents who said they were 
confused about the time and place for past treatments. 
</P>
<P>
In a further effort to reduce confusion, state officials now plan to send out 
mailers to 699,000 residents around the Southland who live in spray areas, 
notifying them of the January schedule. That includes more than 30,000 homes 
and businesses in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The Southland spray region includes 277 square miles in nine separate areas, 
most of which are residential. In Los Angeles County, the spraying will take 
place in North Hollywood, Glendora and the Downey-Norwalk area. 
</P>
<P>
The schedule for spraying beyond January will depend on the weather. State and 
local agricultural officials said Tuesday that they expect to spray in the 
infested areas every 21 days during cold weather, stepping up the frequency as 
the temperatures rise and the Medfly life expectancy shortens. By spring, 
helicopters may be spraying malathion once every seven to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural officials, acknowledging they may have underestimated the severity 
of the current problem, say the multiple sprayings are needed to avoid a repeat 
of the 1981 epidemic. The Medfly, which lays its eggs in more than 250 
different types of produce, cost the state agriculture industry millions of 
dollars in lost goods that year. By some estimates, the infestation also cost 
then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. his political standing because of his failure to 
respond quickly. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, meanwhile, an umbrella group called the Coalition Against Urban 
Spraying began organizing this week to try and persuade local politicians to 
abandon the spraying policy. They assert that the malathion treatments pose 
both safety and environmental threats. 
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated expressions of concern from the public, state officials insist 
the malathion pesticide mixture, in the low doses used in the aerial 
applications, poses no health threat. ERIC LICHTBLAU

The Dana Point Chamber of Commerce has donated the proceeds of a recent 10-K 
run to the anti-drug abuse program at Dana Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber has contributed about $4,000 to the program this year, including 
$1,442 from a Thanksgiving Day run. About 2,800 runners took part in the event, 
and the chamber donated 50 cents to the program for each participant.

RESIDENTS TARGET PORNOGRAPHIC FILMS

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week was presented with petitions signed by about 1,200 
area residents protesting the sale and rental of pornographic films at some 
local adult bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
Church leaders and an anti-pornography group delivered the petitions, which 
object to movies depicting the graphic abuse of women. Police Chief John R. 
Robertson said at least two such films had been recently seized by the Garden 
Grove police, and that his department would meet with the district attorney to 
discuss prosecution of the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Sharon K. Newland, 33, pastor of family ministries at Living Springs 
Christian Fellowship in Garden Grove, told the City Council on Monday that the 
films were much worse than soft-core pornography. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking about Playboy or X-rated videos," Newland said. 
</P>
<P>
She urged city and county officials to prosecute the makers and marketers of 
such materials on obscenity charges. JAMES TORTOLANO

GROUP SAYS CITY HAD ANTI-VAGRANT POLICY 
</P>

<P>
The city has tried to force homeless people out of the Civic Center and parks, 
the Legal Aid Society of Orange County said Tuesday, notwithstanding officials' 
claims that its policy was only to remove discarded belongings. 
</P>
<P>
"The city had every intention to drive the homeless out of Santa Ana for good," 
said Legal Aid attorney Crystal Sims. 
</P>
<P>
In a city memo dated June 16, 1988, Allen E. Doby, director of the city's 
Recreation and Community Services Agency, wrote, "The City Council has 
developed a policy that vagrants are no longer welcome in the City of Santa 
Ana." Later in the same memo, Doby wrote that the city had a program to deal 
with "vagrants." 
</P>
<P>
"In essence, the mission of this program will be to move all vagrants and their 
paraphernalia out of Santa Ana by continually removing them from the places 
that they are frequenting in the city, such as Civic Center, Center Park, the 
mission, the Hospitality House on the east side of town and other city 
facilities that offer refuge to them." 
</P>
<P>
In another memo, Doby wrote that his agency would need $22,000 more to "meet 
the city's objective of cleaning up its neighborhoods and forcing out the 
vagrant population." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Edward J. Cooper said that Doby had mistakenly believed that the 
City Council had such a policy. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no policy before and there is no policy now on the homeless," Cooper 
said. "The only policy is to maintain the parks." 
</P>
<P>
Legal Aid is representing several homeless clients who are suing Santa Ana for 
lost belongings. The city confiscated clothes, bedrolls and other property and 
discarded them in May, 1988, as part of its park maintenance plan. After 
complaints, the homeless were able to reclaim their belongings at a dumpster in 
Centennial Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
The city and the plaintiffs' attorneys are negotiating for a settlement in the 
suit, both sides said Tuesday. LILY ENG

MURDER CONVICTION UPHELD BY COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 38-year-old Orange man twice convicted of murder and twice awarded new trials 
in the 1979 death of his 2-year-old stepdaughter lost his latest bid for 
freedom Tuesday when the state Supreme Court upheld his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court reversed a decision last year by the 4th District Court of 
Appeal in Santa Ana, which had ordered a new trial for Leland Roy Dellinger for 
the second time. 
</P>
<P>
Dellinger, unable to make bail even after his two appellate court victories, 
has remained in either jail or prison since his arrest nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Dellinger was convicted of first-degree murder in 1981 for the May 29, 1979, 
beating death of Jaclyn C. Zilles, the daughter of Diane Pena, who was married 
to the defendant at the time. Dellinger had been in the process of adopting the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors testified for the prosecution that both a head injury and ingestion of 
cocaine were contributing factors in the girl's death. Dellinger testified that 
he was in the kitchen at the time and heard a noise and that he then found the 
toddler at the bottom of a set of seven carpeted steps. 
</P>
<P>
The original autopsy after the incident listed the girl's death as accidental. 
However, after a toxicological report three months later showed the child had 
ingested cocaine, a second autopsy was ordered. The pathologist's ruling this 
time was that the death could not have been caused by such a fall, and 
Dellinger was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
After his conviction, Dellinger won the next two court rounds: Superior Court 
Judge James F. Judge reduced the jury's verdict to second-degree murder, 
reducing Dellinger's automatic penalty from 25 years to life to 15 years to 
life. Then in 1985, the 4th District Court of Appeal reversed his conviction 
and ordered a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
The justices ruled that prosecutors had used an unscientific re-creation using 
mannequins to convince the jurors that the child's injuries were the result of 
violent acts by the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors decided to retry Dellinger, and in 1986 he was convicted by a new 
jury of second-degree murder. Then in 1988, the 4th District Court of Appeal 
again reversed his conviction. This time the court ruled that the trial judge 
had given jurors a confusing instruction on "implied malice" -- a factor 
necessary in second-degree murder. The appellate court found that the jurors' 
interpretation of the law on "implied malice" was so critical it should have 
been made more clear. 
</P>
<P>
But the state Supreme Court, in a 6-1 opinion, ruled that the jurors had been 
adequately informed. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Dellinger had been very optimistic after that second appellate court 
reversal," said Rick Sireff, his appellate attorney from San Diego. "It's going 
to be tough to break this news to him." 
</P>
<P>
Dellinger has been in prison so long that he has already reached his first 
parole hearing, which was denied. He is due for another hearing in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The child's mother, no longer married to Dellinger, could not be reached for 
comment.JERRY HICKS

MALATHION: IT'S A THANKLESS JOB FOR PILOTS ENLISTED TO APPLY PESTICIDE OVER 
PARTS OF ORANGE COUNY. THEY'VE BEEN CURSED AND, IN ONE INSTANCE, EVEN SHOT AT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Josephson and his workers say they really don't like their jobs. The hours 
are bad. The work is stressful, dangerous. They are separated from their 
families one week before Christmas. And the people they are supposed to be 
helping are irritated, if not enraged, by their hovering presence. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been condemned, badgered and shot at," said Josephson, a 49-year-old 
Delano resident who runs a helicopter service in the San Joaquin Valley. "We 
don't do this because we like to do it. We do it because a job like this needs 
top professionals." 
</P>
<P>
Josephson and six pilots form the backbone of a 50-member squadron that has 
been enlisted to apply pesticide over parts of Orange County and other areas of 
Southern California to combat the Mediterranean fruit fly, the crop-destroying 
pest that has spread through more than 250 square miles of residential 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
In the months ahead, their low-flying helicopters will become a commonplace 
sight -- and sound -- over Southland neighborhoods. As part of an escalated 
attack plan, officials have called for at least 12 aerial applications of the 
pesticide malathion over each pocket of infestation. Previously, they had 
attempted to fight infestations with only one spraying. 
</P>
<P>
State and county officials say the aerial applications pose no health risks 
because of the extremely low dose of malathion dropped in a sticky molasses 
bait. Nonetheless, it remains controversial, eliciting protests from some 
residents and politicians who question the need for such an extensive attack. 
</P>
<P>
For Josephson's pilots and ground support crews, the sensitivity drives them to 
extraordinary caution at every step. Virtually every action -- from unsealing 
the pesticide barrel to mapping out the flight plan -- is checked, 
double-checked and measured by somber-faced government officials. If something 
should go wrong, if the pesticide is not properly mixed, or a helicopter sprays 
the wrong neighborhood, a record of each action has been tabulated for the 
resulting state inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that is why the staff goes about their nightly duties on the tarmac at 
El Monte Airport with little emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you serious about everything," Jim Rudig, the state's aerial spray 
program coordinator, said of the criticism. "I'd be lying if I said this was a 
fun job." 
</P>
<P>
On one typical spray night last week, three slick, white helicopters sat alone 
on the tarmac, glistening beneath the airport spotlights. 
</P>
<P>
The six pilots were five miles away eating dinner at a Denny's restaurant. They 
are a quiet lot of middle-aged men from the San Joaquin Valley. Three are 
Vietnam War veterans, one is a sheriff's deputy, another is a test pilot for 
the National Guard, others are full-time pilots working for Josephson. They 
said publicity didn't interest them. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't interested in being heroes or anything," said Josephson, a pilot 
himself. "We just keep a low profile and stay out of the limelight so we can 
get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
They sleep in the Vagabond Hotel, eat dinner together in coffee shops like 
Denny's and then head straight to the airport to tend their choppers every 
night. 
</P>
<P>
On this night, like all others, the six pilots arrived at 8 p.m. sharp, wearing 
bomber jackets, down vests and jeans. Their arrival prompted a surge of 
activity around the Bell 204 helicopters. The men circled the choppers, 
touching the walls of the craft feeling for possible cracks, shining 
flashlights on engine parts and rotor blades. 
</P>
<P>
A chubby tanker truck pulled up along side the helicopters, followed by four 
government pickup trucks. A man in a white jumpsuit unraveled a hose from the 
tanker, stuck the nozzle into the belly of the helicopter and pumped out 250 
gallons of corn syrup laced with malathion. 
</P>
<P>
The crew spoke their own language, an odd mix of military slang and 
agricultural terms. The "ships" were to follow "flight lines" above city 
streets, guided by ground navigators' "cue-beams" as they dropped "bait spray" 
over the sleeping populace. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter crews prefer the term "bait spray" to "pesticides." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a big difference," Josephson said. "This is not contact spraying. Bugs 
are not physically drowning in spray. What we do here is apply bait. A fly has 
to eat the bait to die." 
</P>
<P>
Josephson said that when he sprays crops in Bakersfield to kill bugs such as 
the beet leaf hopper, it is not uncommon to drop 10 to 20 gallons of water and 
pesticide over every acre. Officials say the Medfly sprayings drop 12.4 ounces 
of mixture over an acre, 2.8 ounces of which is malathion. 
</P>
<P>
Josephson's firm, San Joaquin Helicopters, is one of the largest aerial 
application and ground spraying operations in the West. His company, which 
charges the state about $40,000 a night to treat 20 square miles, was the 
lowest bidder in a state contract awarded last year. He and most of his crew 
are veterans of the Northern California Medfly infestation of 1980-81 and are 
noted among their peers as pioneers of urban pesticide spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Josephson said that in 1980-81, he and his crew flew amid "public hysteria" 
over the aerial pesticide applications. One of his helicopters was shot at, but 
not damaged, in that infestation. No such incident has occurred in the current 
outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
The customized choppers are equipped with 12-foot spray booms on each side with 
three nozzles each. The booms, which look like metal sprinkler pipes, are 
connected to a 300-gallon tank that sits in the belly of the chopper. 
</P>
<P>
After completing a final nozzle test, the roaring helicopters gently lifted off 
in unison and flew eastward, looking much like giant invader insects 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Night flying poses its own special difficulties, Josephson said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had our preference we would fly in the daytime when it is easier to see, 
easier to land safely in an emergency," he said. "It's the hardest thing to 
find a spray zone in the middle of 50 miles of city lights. I mean we have to 
pick out that area, line up and spray. We have to keep in formation and keep 
our lines straight." 
</P>
<P>
The pilots use a sophisticated navigational computer called Loran, which stands 
for long range area navigation. The pilots find the exact boundaries of the 
spray zone by inputting the latitude and longitude of the street intersections 
below. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots fly single file in east-west lines, crossing the spray zone up to 
300 times in a night. Their eyes are fixed most of the time on digital computer 
figures and instrument compasses. When they reach a designated boundary the 
co-pilot flicks on the spray switch. 
</P>
<P>
All during the flight the Loran prints out the exact path of the chopper. If a 
resident later complains that the wrong neighborhood was sprayed, state 
officials have a record. 
</P>
<P>
As a backup, six human navigators position themselves at each end of the 
boundaries and hold up bright spotlights, "cue beams," to catch the eye of the 
pilots. When the ships pass, they race to the next block and wait for the next 
fly-by. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another team of agricultural inspectors is actually out catching 
malathion rain drops. At several spots inside and just outside the zone, they 
lay out 12-inch-square white cards that will show the drop size and coverage of 
the spray. They call themselves the "Kimby card team," a non-military term that 
refers to the absorbent baby diaper material lining the cards. 
</P>
<P>
If drops show up on cards outside the zone, the Kimby team radios the 
helicopter pilots and advises them to turn off the spray a bit earlier upon 
boundary approach. 
</P>
<P>
The intense activity leaves little time for the pilots to think about the 
people down below, some who get caught in the spray. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we are up and see people playing tennis or out on the soccer field," 
Josephson said. "So we try not to worry about it because it will all wash off." 
</P>

sprayings in January for North County neighborhoods. B2

STATE SENATE CANDIDATE ACCUSES RIVAL OF 'SPECIAL-INTEREST' TIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Republican State Senate candidate Ron Isles launched his first attack Tuesday 
in what could be a messy campaign by charging that Republican opponent Frank 
Hill "is moonlighting for special interests." 
</P>
<P>
Isles, a candidate for the special election to replace State Sen. William 
Campbell, issued a statement saying the Whittier assemblyman collected $52,412 
last year in gifts and honorariums. That is more than Hill's $44,000 
legislative salary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Where I come from, it looks like Frank Hill has a second job; he is 
moonlighting for the special interests," said Isles, a Brea City Council 
member. 
</P>
<P>
Hill did not return repeated telephone calls to his office Monday or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian's announcement Tuesday that the primary for the 31st 
Senate District will be held Feb. 6 has forced the three announced Republican 
candidates into a quick campaign that has already seen Assemblyman Gil Ferguson 
(R-Newport Beach), the other Republican running for the GOP-dominated district, 
accuse Hill of being involved in a "Machiavellian scheme" to eliminate him from 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
Isles' campaign manager, Harvey Englander, promised that the issue of ethics -- 
believed heightened in the public's mind by recent scandals in Sacramento and 
Washington -- will play a major role in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Isles' statement Tuesday noted that Hill was a subject of the FBI's 
investigation into influence-peddling at the state Capitol. Hill's office was 
searched as part of the investigation, but no charges have been filed against 
him. Hill has declined to comment on the sting operation.

MIKE PENNER: LOSING YOUNT KEEPS ANGELS A STEP BEHIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First the Batman and now Robin. They could have been contenders, or at least 
Angels, but today Joe Carter and Robin Yount have their assignments for 1990 
and neither will have to answer to Doug Rader. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, slugger extraordinaire, went to San Diego two weeks ago in a trade and 
Tuesday, Yount re-upped with Milwaukee. The top two names on the Angels' 
most-wanted list got away -- Where have we heard that before? -- and the Angels 
are left to pat themselves on the back for Mark Langston while swearing they 
have other irons in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, the Angels did announce the signing of right-handed relief pitcher Mark 
Eichhorn, who was released by the Atlanta Braves. This must rate as some kind 
of blockbuster. We weren't aware the Braves had enough pitching to part with 
any of it. 
</P>
<P>
Eichhorn, 29, was 5-5 with a 4.35 ERA in 45 games with Atlanta last season. 
Before that, he was 1-0 with 19 saves at triple-A Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
So that's one way of keeping pace in the American League West. A Mark Eichhorn 
for a Mark Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The Yount thing hurts. Before the 1989 AL MVP re-signed with the Brewers for 
$9.6 million, the Angels had visions of putting Yount in center field and 
moving Devon White to right, which, some insist, is White's best position. Gene 
Mauch used to call White the best natural right fielder he'd seen since Al 
Kaline. 
</P>
<P>
Yount also could have batted leadoff for the Angels, ridding White of the 
albatross, and added a 100-RBI presence to a lineup that placed 12th in the 
American League in RBIs last season. More than that, Yount could have followed 
up on the missionary work done by Bert Blyleven in the Angel clubhouse and 
dislodged a few more bricks from the stonewall. 
</P>
<P>
Yount was a cure-all, a panacea. He was the one free agent Rader really wanted. 
</P>
<P>
And the Angels were ready to pay the price. Reportedly, they were prepared to 
offer Yount the world, or at least large parts of it. Raiding Arizona was the 
plan. The Autrys own property in that state and what's a few orange groves when 
the treasure trove is at hand? 
</P>
<P>
 Robin, this land is your land. 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Mike Port insists the Angels never made Yount a formal offer. 
Semantics are at work here, but in one respect, Port speaks the truth. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, the only offer Yount considered was the Brewers'. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted to sign with the team I've played for throughout my entire 
career," Yount said Tuesday in a prepared statement. That's a 16-year career, 
no small amount of water under the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Yount, Robin's player-agent brother, may have had his eyes on California, 
but he isn't the one who broke in with Milwaukee as a 18-year-old shortstop in 
1974. He isn't the one who led the Brewers to their first and only World Series 
in 1982. He isn't the one who received 6,000 letters from Wisconsin school 
kids, pleading with their hero to stay at home. 
</P>
<P>
Beer is thicker than water and Yount, though raised in Woodland Hills, has 
become a Milwaukee kind of guy. Take Yount out of Milwaukee and you might as 
well take the holes out of the cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Angels are the ones with the hole, although Port persists in brushing 
up for his blurbs for the 1990 season-ticket brochure. 
</P>
<P>
Plugs Port: "If we were to open tomorrow, with the addition of Mark Langston 
(and) knowing what kind of pitcher Chuck Finley is at the major league level 
and projecting a year's improvement from Jim Abbott . . . (we believe) we're a 
good baseball club and we're working on things that would make us even better." 
</P>
<P>
If the Angels were to open tomorrow, they'd be looking at the same fate that 
met them in 1989. Third place. 
</P>
<P>
The A's are still the A's, a little thinner perhaps, but still equipped with 
the Henderson-Canseco-McGwire axis. 
</P>
<P>
And Kansas City not only has the Angels out-Davis-ed -- a Mark and a Storm beat 
a Chili -- but the Royals also have the better everyday lineup. George Brett, 
Bo Jackson, Kevin Seitzer and now Gerald Perry, who was a National League 
All-Star in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the Angels need to do something and, now, getting what they want will 
require giving up a player or two. The free-agent field has been harvested, 
leaving Port to ponder trade proposals for the likes of Ellis Burks and Von 
Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
And if not Hayes, how about a Philadelphia teammate named Lenny Dykstra? He 
plays the outfield, he runs into walls, he steals bases and he bats leadoff. 
He's also from Orange County, a Garden Grove High grad, which wouldn't hurt 
attendance any. 
</P>
<P>
Look what happened the last time the Angels dipped into the Garden Grove 
League. A Santiago High alum, name of Blyleven, went 17-5 and won AL comeback 
player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Yount is gone but for the Angels, all is not lost. Yet. Port still has three 
months and six starting pitchers to play with. 
</P>
<P>
Time is on the Angels' side. 
</P>
<P>
Catching the A's, however, would have been a lot easier if Yount had been there 
too.

EVERETT HAS THE OFFENSE PASSING ALL TESTS; 
</P>
<P>
RAMS: WITH AN ON-TARGET ATTACK LEADING THE WAY, ROBINSON LIKES HIS TEAM'S 
CHANCES AGAINST ANY TEAM.

<P>
Has Jim Everett hurled the Rams into a new league? Is the franchise no longer 
destined to playoff disappointments rooted in an offense that wasn't quite 
potent enough? 
</P>
<P>
Could be. At least Coach John Robinson believes so. These days, you'll hear him 
talk about seeing "eye-to-eye" with any team in football and how this team has 
as good a chance to reach to the Super Bowl as any he has coached. 
</P>
<P>
And most of that optimism centers on an offense that seems capable of scoring 
40 points against anyone . . . when it's in sync. 
</P>
<P>
"Offensively, we're a load to handle," Robinson said. "We have a lot of 
weapons, a lot of ways to strike. I think we're a pretty dangerous offensive 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have the potential to win any of the remaining games we play. We 
certainly don't look at anybody we would play and say those people are better 
than us." 
</P>
<P>
Everett, of course, is the key player, coordinating the Ram arsenal from his 
command post in the pocket. And lately, the fourth-year quarterback has been 
doing the two things that win games: he's making the right decisions and 
delivering the ball with accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Everett leads the National Football League in touchdown passes (28) and yards 
(4,129) and is the league's third-best passer with a rating of 93.2. If you've 
seen him play recently, you don't need to know the numbers to judge Everett's 
ability to throw the football. A lot of his passes hit receivers in the hands. 
</P>
<P>
Everett even seems to know when to underthrow a long pass just enough to allow 
Henry Ellard or Flipper Anderson time to slow down and catch it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think accuracy comes with confidence and timing," Robinson said. "Ernie 
(Zampese, the offensive coordinator) always says, 'Turn it loose, turn it 
loose. If you feel it, turn it loose.' You know, don't aim, throw it out there 
and make the receiver catch it. 
</P>
<P>
"And (Everett) turns the damn thing loose, so he's never really late and he 
doesn't have to throw it so hard. He's just putting it out and he isn't waiting 
to see if guys are open." 
</P>
<P>
The trick here, of course, is to have the correct feeling before turning it 
loose. Throwing the ball to the other team is frowned upon. 
</P>
<P>
Either Everett is beginning to master this somewhat spiritual art or he has 
been guessing right a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"What's amazing to me is how his vision seems to be broadening," Robinson said. 
"He's coming off the field and describing what he saw, and you look the next 
day (at the films) where you get to see the complete picture, and he's pretty 
damn accurate. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll say, 'I saw that guy widen his stance and I knew we could get behind 
him,' and I'll say, 'Yeah, right.' But it appears to be true. I'm really 
impressed with what he sees now." 
</P>
<P>
Everett would be the first to point out that what he sees are a bunch of guys 
getting open. 
</P>
<P>
Eight Rams have 19 or more catches this season. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receivers Ellard, Anderson and Aaron Cox have caught a total of 127 passes 
for 2,723 yards and 16 touchdowns. Tight ends Pete Holohan and Damone Johnson 
have 74 receptions, 650 yards and 10 touchdowns. And running backs Buford 
McGee, Bobby Delpino and Greg Bell have 86 catches, 694 yards and four 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
When you consider that Anderson and Cox accounted for 28 catches and 571 yards 
in the two games Ellard missed with a hamstring injury, the depth of the Ram 
receiving corps is evident. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who has a reception average of 27.1 yards, has been an important 
addition. A threat to score on every play, he has relieved some of the pressure 
previously directed toward Ellard. 
</P>
<P>
"Flipper has had a great year with the big play," Robinson said. "It almost 
seems like magic. He's got great speed and great concentration at the point of 
reception." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has no doubts about Anderson's ability to join Ellard in catching 75 
to 80 passes a season, but the coach is not so sure that would be a prudent 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what's more valuable than 27.1," Robinson said. "That's a 
phenomenal number. I don't know that we want to try and change our concept and 
get Henry with 80 and Flipper with 80." 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback LeRoy Irvin may have said the Rams and Jets played with the emotions 
of two 80-year-olds Sunday, but Robinson was satisfied with the Rams' effort. 
</P>
<P>
"People seem to get on these emotion kicks," Robinson said. "You play a game 
like this and people ask if you're going to be flat. And then you play the game 
and people say you were flat and you win, 38-14. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we played the game the way you're supposed to play the game. I think 
we did an effective job of preparing and executing our responsibilities. I 
thought we were efficient and solid and controlled the game completely. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a rather dominant performance. I did not think we were flat 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
Which team do you think the Rams would least like to face in the playoffs? A 
good bet is Minnesota. The Vikings have one of the best home-field advantages 
in football. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's the Minnesota defense. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, on filling out his Pro Bowl ballot: "You almost want to put their 
whole defensive team on." 
</P>
<P>
Patriots' Coach Raymond Berry said quarterback Steve Grogan will play Sunday 
against the Rams if Marc Wilson's injured finger "interferes with his execution 
significantly." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has a stress fracture on the index finger of his right hand. He was 
injured in the second half of last week's 28-10 loss at Pittsburgh and has a 
splint on the finger.

NOT MUCH CHEER AT LINCOLN'S $80,000 COOKIE PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two full, steaming pots of cider sat on portable burners, and plates of cookies 
near the teller windows appeared to be untouched. 
</P>
<P>
Sofas and chairs were arranged around coffee tables and amid desks where 
lenders once sat, giving a homey, close-knit feeling in an office entirely too 
big for the traffic coming through the door. 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the Christmas season, the insolvent Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan is 
spending an estimated $80,000 to advertise its offering of free cookies and 
cider to customers at all 29 branches. But holiday cheer wasn't infectious at 
this Huntington Beach branch. For half an hour during lunchtime Tuesday, no one 
came to sample the cider, much less put any money in their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"We get some customers in the morning and again from 2 to 4 in the afternoon," 
said one of the three branch employees. "But most of our money comes in through 
large CDs . . . and we can't make any loans." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine-based Lincoln was seized by the government in April, and regulators will 
not allow the S&amp;L to make loans. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's holiday treat for customers isn't unusual for S&amp;Ls. Many thrifts 
provide free goodies to customers during holiday seasons. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike Lincoln, they are not destined to become the biggest industry 
disaster. Taxpayers could be hit with a $2-billion bill to clean up the 
S&amp;L, which regulators seized in April. 
</P>
<P>
More importantly, critics say, Lincoln has lost more than $875 million in the 
first nine months this year and shouldn't be paying the estimated $80,000 in 
newspaper advertisements to invite their customers in for cookies and cider. 
</P>
<P>
Regulatory officials in Washington thought that advertising the S&amp;L's 
season's greetings was appropriate, though a bit extravagant. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Lincoln's marketing department got a little carried away with the size 
of the ads," said Caryl Austrian, a spokeswoman for the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L's good cheer wasn't wasted, though, said Mark Randall, a regulatory 
executive managing Lincoln. Other offices in the Lincoln network generally see 
a "considerable number of customers," he said.

HOTELS FIGHT HOLIDAY SLUMP WITH BARGAINS; 
</P>
<P>
LODGING: ORANGE COUNTY HOTELIERS FIND THAT LOWER-THAN-USUAL OCCUPANCY RATES 
THIS CHRISTMAS SEASON CAP A DISAPPOINTING YEAR FOR TOURISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With Christmas only days away, one of the best bargains these days isn't on the 
retailers' racks. It was at Orange County's hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Just as sure as there are jammed stores and packed parking lots at area malls, 
it is a certainty that the holidays will be the slowest time of the year for 
the lodging industry. And Orange County's hoteliers are finding that this 
season is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the worst I've seen in the past 23 years," bemoaned John Hill, general 
manager of the Heritage Inn in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The occupancy level at the 124-room Heritage is down about 30% for November and 
December compared to the same period in 1988, he said. Hill attributes this 
year's drop to fewer Asian tourists and the countywide glut of hotels. 
</P>
<P>
While others are more optimistic, the Heritage is by no means alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Business travelers as well as tourists just don't travel as much," said Sandra 
Louvier, a hotel consultant with the accounting firm of Laventhol &amp; Horwath 
in Costa Mesa. "So it's not unusual for (hotel occupancy rates) to run in the 
40% or 50% range." 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the seasonal problem this year is the fact that 1989 has been, at 
best, a disappointing year for tourism in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The result? Hotels from Fullerton to Dana Point are following what has become a 
Christmas tradition: slashing room rates and offering special package deals. 
Consider, for example, these basement-level bargains on room rates: 
</P>
<P>
* The Disneyland Hotel -- generally acknowledged to be one of the most 
successful in the county -- is offering a special rate of $99 per couple on 
Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. That compares to a usual rate of $150 to $180 for 
each night in those same accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
* Through New Year's eve, the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel and Tennis Club has 
a $99 special for its Two for Breakfast Promotion, which includes a double room 
for one night, plus breakfast the next morning. By lowering the usual daily 
rate of about $164 for doubles, marketing director Greg Smith estimates that 
the 600-room hotel fills another 15 to 20 rooms each night. 
</P>
<P>
* The Hyatt Regency Alicante in Garden Grove is offering package deals to the 
Freedom Bowl or Disneyland, including a one-night stay and two tickets to the 
football game or the theme park, priced at $125 and $128, respectively. That 
compares with the ordinary rate of $139 per night for a double room, without 
other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
* Even the exclusive Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel has a holiday package. The deal 
costs $350 per couple for two nights' stay in the ocean-view hotel, and 
includes a gift basket loaded with luxury tidbits such as champagne and a gift 
booklet for shopping at South Coast Plaza's Crystal Court annex. Ordinarily, 
rooms at the Ritz-Carlton go for $185 to $360 per night. 
</P>
<P>
What they are all trying to do is put some life into the deadest time of the 
year, a time when meetings and convention business has wound down and what 
pleasure travelers there are often prefer to stay with family or friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody likes to be away from home during the holidays," said Smith of the 
Newport Beach Marriott. "So hotels just aren't the hot spots over the holidays 
-- at least to sleep, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
The countywide numbers for 1988 give a good indication of just how low 
occupancy can go during the off-season. Consider that all of Orange County had 
a 53.7% occupancy level last December -- contrasted with a 68.4% occupancy 
level for the county during all of 1988, according to Pannell Kerr Forster, an 
accounting firm that monitors the hotel industry. 
</P>
<P>
Industry experts say in general that an occupancy level of about 65% is needed 
for a hotel to make money. So if they had to depend on holiday traffic alone, 
it would be a depressing business. 
</P>
<P>
"You would not build a hotel for that type of occupancy," said Jim Burba, a 
partner with Pannell Kerr in Irvine, referring to holiday occupancy levels. 
"But everyone realizes that's part of the business and plans for it 
accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
So hotels look for ways to lure guests and trim expenses. They generally lower 
prices as an enticement and many hotels reduce their staff to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Most hotels have no choice but to lay off a tremendous amount of workers in 
order to counteract expenses," said William Torresala, general manager of the 
Pan Pacific Hotel in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
While the Pan Pacific this year opted to keep all of its regular employees 
during December, Torresala said some hotels will lay off as much as 50% of 
their staff -- especially housekeepers, gardeners, bellmen and front desk 
personnel -- for half of December. 
</P>
<P>
Sprucing up the premises by adding a bit of Christmas cheer never hurt 
occupancy, either. That's why the Ritz-Carlton, for example, starts its 
celebrating soon after Thanksgiving with a ceremony to light its 50-foot tree. 
</P>
<P>
"Since December is the weakest month of the year, we had two choices," said 
Henry Schielein, general manager at the 393-room hotel. "Either lay everyone 
off and close up shop or create other options." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to offering package rates, those other options at the Ritz-Carlton 
have come to include carolers, puppet shows, a gigantic gingerbread house and a 
display of 130,000 white lights -- all of which are heavily promoted. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy seems to work. Since the hotel began actively promoting Christmas 
a few years ago, occupancy in December has climbed to the low 60s from the low 
40s, Schielein said, making the Ritz among the most successful in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel industry also relies heavily on holiday parties and New Year's Eve to 
bring in much needed revenue dollars at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
With Christmas celebrations, year-ender parties and employees being taken to 
lunch, the Newport Beach Marriott, for instance, sees probably a 15% jump in 
food and beverage sales in December, Smith estimated. 
</P>
<P>
O.C. HOTELS SUFFER DECEMBER SLOWDOWN

While occupancy rates plunged last December, a boom in food and beverage sales

An engineer who quit his job with a Garden Grove defense contractor sued his 
former employer Tuesday, alleging he was driven out because he blew the whistle 
on a scheme to defraud the government. 
</P>
<P>
John A. Trepl II contends that officials of Swedlow Inc. began to pressure him 
last year after he refused to cooperate in the firm's alleged scheme to cover 
up flaws in windshields it manufactured for the B-1B bomber. Trepl also said he 
alerted the FBI to the case. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Swedlow and one of its vice presidents, Norman Gene Nixon, 53, of 
Orange were indicted by a federal grand jury on four counts of making false 
statements to the government. 
</P>
<P>
At their trial in Santa Ana in March, prosecutors will try to prove that Nixon 
directed his underlings to falsify reports in order to minimize the defects in 
four windshields manufactured for the Air Force. Both defendants have pleaded 
not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
The government has confirmed that the windshields are flight-safe. But the Air 
Force required Swedlow to get its permission before repairing any defects that 
were more than four inches long or one inch deep, which Swedlow allegedly 
failed to do. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement sources said at the time of the indictment that the 
investigation was launched after a Swedlow employee called the FBI in Santa Ana 
and alleged that Nixon was instructing workers to cover up the extent of the 
defects. The employee was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for Swedlow and Nixon could not be reached Tuesday to comment on 
Trepl's lawsuit, filed in Orange County Superior Court. Swedlow is one of the 
nation's biggest manufacturers of military aircraft windows. 
</P>
<P>
Trepl, who lives in San Bernardino, said in the suit that after two years 
working for Swedlow, he was assigned on Sept. 1, 1988, to be project engineer 
for the B-1 windshield and side-window program. 
</P>
<P>
At a design engineering meeting that morning, Nixon discussed a defect in the 
delamination -- a separation between layers -- in the windshields, the suit 
said. Nixon told those present to "misrepresent" the nature of the defects, 
Trepl said. 
</P>
<P>
Trepl objected, saying the "defects should be dealt with in an honest manner," 
the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Trepl was relieved of his new assignment and told he no 
longer had a future with Swedlow, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
From that point on, Trepl alleged, he was assigned unusually large workloads, 
denied overtime and received poor performance ratings. On Jan. 5, he received a 
memo terminating his employment and giving him the chance to resign. He 
resigned Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Trepl's suit seeks unspecified damages.

PAGE AGREES TO BUY DAILY PILOT AND 4 WEEKLY PAPERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Robert E. Page, former publisher of the Chicago Sun-Times and Boston Herald, 
has agreed as expected to purchase the Orange Coast Daily Pilot and four local 
weekly newspapers from Adams Communications Corp. Terms of the transaction were 
not disclosed, but sources pegged the price at around $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Page said the Pilot offices in Costa Mesa would serve as headquarters for a 
"Southern California publishing company," and that "other transactions are 
pending." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to discuss what other papers he may be purchasing, but is 
reportedly pursuing the North Coast Publishers Inc., a group of weeklies in 
Northern San Diego County, and the daily Glendale News-Press. 
</P>
<P>
The Pilot, purchased by Adams Communications from Ingersoll Publications last 
year, has a circulation of about 23,000 in the Costa Mesa-Newport Beach area. 
The weekly newspapers -- all called the Independent -- serve Newport Beach, 
Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Pilot publisher Rosemary Churchman has resigned, but Page said other staff 
changes were not anticipated at this time. Page emphasized his commitment to 
expand the paper's influence and become involved in the community, and added 
that he is now living in rented quarters in Newport Beach and expects to settle 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Financing for the Pilot acquisition, which is expected to close today, came in 
part from a New York media investor, Elliot Stein Jr., who will serve as 
chairman of Page Group Publishing Inc. Stein is managing partner of a new New 
York investment house called Commonwealth Capital Partners, which counts Page's 
company as its first investment. 
</P>
<P>
Page described Commonwealth as his "partner" and said it would be involved in 
any additional transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Stein's other media interests -- which are not part of Commonwealth -- include 
El Vocero, which Stein described as the largest Spanish language newspaper in 
Puerto Rico, as well as the Los Angeles-based weekly Mundo Artistico, a trade 
magazine company, and four television stations. 
</P>
<P>
Stein said Commonwealth had "a lot of capital" and would "do what it takes" to 
help Page build his newspaper group. He noted that Page was "a very imaginative 
publisher who's going into a small market compared to what he's done before, 
and he's going to apply all his ideas and marketing talents to make (the Pilot) 
useful for its readers." 
</P>
<P>
Page said he has no plans for major changes at the Pilot but said he believed 
the paper had "significant opportunities" to grow, in terms of circulation, 
advertising and influence. He added that the paper would focus on local issues, 
emphasizing life style, the arts, local government and high school sports. 
</P>
<P>
The Pilot's circulation has dropped by nearly half since the late 1970s, 
falling to about 20,000 when Adams purchased the newspaper in June, 1988. Kirk 
Cheyfitz, president of the publishing division of Adams Communications, said in 
October that the paper had picked up about 3,000 subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
Page rejected suggestions that the Pilot, which has been caught in the 
cross-fire of the fierce competition between The Times and The Orange County 
Register, would have to reorient its position in the market. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spent my whole life as an underdog -- at UPI fighting the mighty AP, at 
the Boston Herald when (media mogul Rupert) Murdoch first bought it, and at the 
Sun-Times, and we've made an awful lot of money," Page said. 
</P>
<P>
Page joined Murdoch in 1981 after a long career at United Press International 
and soon became publisher of the Boston Herald. In 1984, he moved to the 
Chicago paper, which was also owned at the time by Murdoch, as publisher. Page 
led a management buyout of the Sun-Times in 1986 but resigned as publisher last 
year and sold his interest after reportedly clashing with investors and other 
executives.

MICKEY IS OUT, MAGELLAN IS IN AT PORTUGAL'S HISTORICAL THEME PARK; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: UNDER AN AMBITIOUS PLAN BY U.S. BUSINESSMEN, 15TH-CENTURY 
EXPLORERS WILL STAR IN AN AMUSEMENT ATTRACTION TO OPEN IN 1993 NEAR LISBON.

Vasco da Gama and Ferdinand Magellan may seem unlikely rivals for Donald Duck 
and Mickey Mouse. But under an ambitious plan by a group of U.S. businessmen, 
the 15th-Century Portuguese explorers could vie with Walt Disney stars as major 
European theme park attractions. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S.-owned company, backed by the Portuguese government, is planning an 
$80-million to $100-million theme park near Lisbon, based on the pioneering 
Portuguese sea voyages to Africa, Asia and the New World some 500 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The Lusolandia park is set for a 1993 opening, one year after the scheduled 
launch of a Euro Disneyland park in France. 
</P>
<P>
Lusolandia Holdings chairman Edward Kane, a Boston native, said the project 
sprang from Disney's rejection five years ago of an idea from then-Portuguese 
Prime Minister Mario Soares to locate a European Disneyland in Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
As Lisbon representative of the Washington-based International Trade and 
Guarantee Corp., a company advising U.S. businesses abroad, Kane had been asked 
by Soares -- currently Portuguese president -- to approach Disney. 
</P>
<P>
"Walt Disney Enterprises basically said no way, Portugal is too small potatoes 
for them," Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
Disney decided to locate closer to Europe's more affluent and densely populated 
"golden triangle" formed by London, Paris and Brussels. Their French amusement 
park program foresees costs of up to $2.8 billion to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
After Disney's refusal, Kane turned to Management Resources, an Anaheim company 
specializing in creating and running theme parks and formed by ex-Disney 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the idea of . . . instead of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck . . . let's 
make it a Portuguese historical theme park, let's replace Donald Duck with 
Bartolomeu Dias and Mickey Mouse with Vasco da Gama," said Kane, a retired U.S. 
foreign service officer. 
</P>
<P>
Portuguese authorities backed the plan, and Mangagement Resources 
enthusiastically joined the project. Feasibility studies predicted 2.15 million 
first-year customers from Portugal's 10 million inhabitants and foreign 
visitors to Portugal who last year topped 16 million. 
</P>
<P>
The park is to be built near the town of Azambuja, 28 miles northeast of Lisbon 
along the main north-south freeway to Oporto, Portugal's second largest city. 
</P>
<P>
Kane said the park will also have good road links to Portugal's main tourist 
destination -- the southern Algarve region -- and to neighboring Spain. The 
site proposed for a new Lisbon international airport is seven miles to the east 
of the park location. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors will enter the 247-acre park into a mock-up of Renaissance Lisbon, 
complete with castle and 15th-Century main street. 
</P>
<P>
From a reconstructed quay, replicas of the explorers' caravels will carry 
would-be Magellans on a voyage of discovery across an artificial lake to "theme 
areas" representing Brazilian jungles, mysterious African kingdoms and the 
glittering civilizations of India, China and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Kane said the latest technology will be used to create a have-fun-as-you-learn 
environment for adults and children. The park publicity brochure promises ocean 
storms and Amazonian canoe trips as well as cultural exhibits highlighting 
lands along the Portuguese sea routes. 
</P>
<P>
Portuguese historians will advise on the park's authenticity and experts from 
other countries will be contacted to set up Japanese teahouses and African 
dance displays. 
</P>
<P>
Lusolandia Holdings is registered in Bermuda and owned 50-50 by Management 
Resources and International Trade and Guarantee Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Kane said, they will be joined by a Portuguese partner and create a 
Portuguese company -- Lusolandia Empreedimentos Turisticas. 
</P>
<P>
Private financing for the project is being sought mainly in Europe. Kane also 
hopes to gain Portuguese government funding and is discussing loan prospects 
with the Luxembourg-based European Investment Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese government has created a special task force of officials from 
four ministries to steer the project through Lisbon's bureaucratic maze. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the ideas of Prince Henry the Navigator, Portuguese 14th- and 
15th-Century mariners undertook a series of voyages that expanded Europe's 
perception of the world and opened contacts with the people of other 
continents. 
</P>
<P>
Dias became the first man to sail beyond the shores of North Africa down the 
West African coast to the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, da Gama discovered the sea 
route to India in 1499 and Pedro Alvares Cabral first landed in Brazil in 1500. 
Sailing under Spanish colors, Magellan began the first circumnavigation of the 
globe in 1519.

DEPTH OF COMMITMENT TO BE MEASURED;

<P>
THE ARTS: NOW THAT THE CENTER AND OTHER ATTRACTIONS ARE BUILT, WILL ORANGE 
COUNTY RESIDENTS DIG DEEPER TO GUARANTEE GROWTH, OR WILL GOVERNMENT HELP BECOME 
THE ONLY WAY OUT?

<P>
If the '80s made it safe for much-trumpeted "world class" performers to add 
Orange County to their tour schedules, thus saving local arts lovers the 
arduous trek to Los Angeles, the '90s will test the community's commitment to 
making the county hospitable to home-grown talent. 
</P>
<P>
And with more and more communities forming their own arts commissions to foster 
activities city by city, the byword for Orange County arts in the '90s may 
shift from "world class" to "neighborhood domain." 
</P>
<P>
As high-profile, already-established arts organizations look ahead to complete 
their growth and settle into maturity, high real-estate prices and declining 
government support of the arts make it even tougher for newer and potentially 
more adventurous efforts to get off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
With the Orange County Performing Arts Center as the shining example, the '80s 
were a triumph of the county's conservative, private-enterprise ethic: The 
$73.7-million facility was built without direct government funding. The '90s, 
though, promise to test how deep the donors' pockets really are. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Harbor Art Museum is in the midst of a giant capital campaign, as 
is the Bowers Museum, while the Center hopes to someday proceed with 
long-delayed plans to add two smaller halls. Other efforts aim at padding 
endowment funds to ensure future operating funds; meanwhile, in some areas -- 
particularly classical music -- groups acknowledge rising competition for 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
As the high-profile projects woo audiences and donors, more modest efforts may 
be left out in the cold. Leaders of South Coast Repertory and the Grove Theatre 
Company predict the sprouting of new professional theater companies in the 
coming decade, but the birth can be difficult: just ask Santa Ana's struggling 
Alternative Repertory Theatre or the recently defunct Illusion's New View 
Theatre in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
The risk is that the '90s could find Orange County top-heavy with big 
attractions: The Newport Harbor Art Museum opens its new $50-million home in a 
vacuum, with no serious local gallery scene; a new arena in Anaheim or Santa 
Ana provides a new indoor venue for the Bon Jovis of the world, while a dismal 
club scene forces local bands to travel elsewhere for a place to play; 
audiences pack the Center to see the Kirov, while local dance companies 
continue to founder. 
</P>
<P>
A sports analogy applies: The test of a team's vitality, and that of an arts 
community, rests in its depth, not just in its stars. 
</P>
<P>
This situation figures to be exacerbated by the "cocooning" effect: county 
residents, daunted by ever-worsening traffic and the demands for many of a 
two-career household, will be increasingly inclined to stay home and will 
demand more if and when they do leave the house. 
</P>
<P>
The '90s also will bring more cultural opportunities closer to home. The 
750-seat Irvine Theatre is slated to open in October of next year, while a 
1,500-seat theater for Mission Viejo is in the discussion stage. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach, meanwhile, has plans for a new cultural arts center, and the 
Laguna Art Museum is interested in adding a second shopping mall satellite 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa plans to beef up its arts support, and the county has announced 
intentions to study its role in funding the arts. Even developers are getting 
in on the act: The Foothill Ranch Co. plans to incorporate public art into its 
planned $2-billion community in the Saddleback Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Other promising signs: 
</P>
<P>
If and when the Center adds a planned 800-seat drama house, SCR would likely be 
involved, setting the stage for expanding the scope of the acclaimed company. 
That, and a planned 2,200-seat concert hall, would help to broaden the Center's 
conservative offerings. 
</P>
<P>
County arts organizations say they will work harder to gain minority 
representation on their boards, a promise that comes as the county's ethnic 
minority population is projected to rise. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's only commercial television station, KDOC-TV (Channel 56), plans 
to broaden its local news broadcast from a half-hour three hours daily -- one 
hour each in the morning, afternoon and evening. But for the bulk of its 
programming, the station will continue to rely on its bread and butter: a 
steady diet of reruns that currently includes everything from "Green Acres" to 
"Mod Squad." Public station KOCE-TV (Channel 50), meanwhile, plans to continue 
offering public affairs specials on local topics ranging from transportation to 
a planned county jail. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Irvine, Newport Beach and Laguna Beach seem destined to make a 
culinary splash with their burgeoning restaurant scene. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the marginal state of arts education lingers as an issue more than 10 
years after the passage of Proposition 13. That's a matter of survival for 
local arts leaders looking to the future, who worry about whether youngsters 
are learning enough today to be the arts audience of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
What follows is a discipline-by-discipline rundown of what the '90s hold in 
store for Orange County arts and entertainment.(See separate stories). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Education may hold the key to whether we feed our faces or our spirits. 
</P>
<P>
Arts and Entertainment 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton: Fox Fullerton, which Landmark Theatre Corp. is ravamping into a 
three-screen complex specializing in first-run foreign, art and specialty 
films, as well as some mainstream fare, due to open late 1990 or early '91. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine: New Irvine Theatre, to open October, 1990 at the UC Irvine campus. 
</P>
<P>
Southland: Edwards Cinemas, Orange County's largest theater chain, plans to add 
100 screens in the Southland during 1990 alone, the vast majority going into 
south Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach: Huntington Beach Art Center, scheduled to open spring 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach: Expanding Newport Harbor Art Museum in Newport Beach, scheduled 
to open late in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
What to Look For: Arts and Entertainment around Orange County in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Dining: 
</P>
<P>
If Orange County makes a national name for itself in any realm, it is likely to 
be in the fine art of dining. Several local restaurants are exhibiting a sense 
of refinement and sophistication of the highest level. 
</P>
<P>
Movies: 
</P>
<P>
There will be less variety of what to see, as the lofty prices of the land on 
which the theaters will be built threatens to keep all but the mainstream hits 
locked away. 
</P>
<P>
Pop Music: 
</P>
<P>
Pop music fans should see a modest but encouraging return to sanity in the 
price of concert tickets for major rock and pop attractions, as the fierce 
bidding wars between Irvine Meadows and the Pacific Amphitheatre settle into a 
"more sensible" pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Art Education: 
</P>
<P>
The course arts education takes in the '90s may spell the difference between 
whether Orange County eventually develops a distinct cultural face, or whether 
the indigenous arts scene lays fallow because of public indifference. 
</P>
<P>
Up-and Comers: 
</P>
<P>
Maudette M. Ball, administrative director of the Foothill Urban Arts Program. 
Ball will play a key role in bringing to fruition the ambitious 
mutilimillion-dollar, developer-financed arts program for the Foothill Ranch 
Co.'s $2-billion planned community in Saddleback Valley over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Bradburn, 49, artistic director of concerts at UC Irvine and artistic 
co-director of California Ballet Theatre. One of two founding directors of the 
fledging California Theatre Ballet, Bradburn plans to pass on the expertise and 
repertory he acquired working with Eugene Loring, who founded the UCI dance 
department in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Hellesen,33, playwright. South Coast Repertory In Costa Mesa will mount 
the world premiere of Hellesen's "Once in Arden" in April as part of its 
mainstage season, one of the rare times the Tony Award-winning company has 
produced an Orange County playwright. It will be the first major production for 
Hellesen, who lives in Fullerton and grew up in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Vinnie James, late 20s, rock singer and songwriter. As the '90s begin, Vinnie 
James, a black folk-rocker who lives in Westminster, will lend his own 
forthright singing and distinctive, socially conscious songwriting voice to the 
noble task of tearing down racial walls. 
</P>
<P>
Nalda Osline,33, director, Huntington Beach Art Center (scheduled to open in 
spring 1992). Osline combines knowledge of the alternative arts scene and an 
understanding of the broad role of a community art center.

AUSTRALIAN CONDUCTOR TO LEAD SYMPHONY TONIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
TRYOUT: STUART CHALLENDER IS VIEWED AS A DARK HORSE CANDIDATE TO SUCCEED KEITH 
CLARK AS PERMANENT DIRECTOR OF PACIFIC SYMPHONY. 
</P>

<P>
In every good race, there is a dark horse -- in the ongoing contest to replace 
Keith Clark as music director of the Pacific Symphony, that distinction may 
belong to Stuart Challender, chief conductor of the Sydney (Australia) 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Challender, who will lead the Pacific today and Thursday at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center, was never supposed to be in the race at all. 
</P>
<P>
He's there now because Zdenek Macal of Laguna Niguel, originally announced as 
this week's guest conductor, decided that he didn't want the director's job 
after all. He agreed to release the dates, according to an orchestra 
spokesperson, so that Challender could be considered. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pacific Symphony rang me up two or three months ago," Challender said in a 
recent interview (stressing that they called him, not the other way around). 
"They said Mr. Macal had canceled and was I interested in coming? They knew me 
from last year's Sydney Symphony tour," which began in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Was he aware that the orchestra was conducting a search for a new music 
director? 
</P>
<P>
"I did know that, he said. "But they rang me." 
</P>
<P>
Is he interested in the job? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but we're not talking about that at the moment," he said. "I haven't 
thought about it really. I certainly enjoy working in the States. It depends on 
how we could arrange it in terms of time commitment with Sydney . . . I really 
don't just know . . . If everything goes well at the concerts, we might sit 
down and talk. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Challender was on the phone from Tokyo where he was relaxing after having 
stepped in for an ill Seiji Ozawa for three concerts in Hong Kong with the 
Boston Symphony. (On one of the programs, he split podium duties with Carl St. 
Clair, the orchestra's assistant conductor, who is scheduled to try out with 
the Pacific Symphony on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1.) 
</P>
<P>
A student of Zen Buddhism, Challender had a very good time in Kyoto, visiting 
Zen temples. "But it was a little bit hurried," he said. "I went by bus -- 
which is not a good idea. The traffic is unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
His career, he said, has been going well. In the past year, he has conducted 
about 30 concerts in Australia and has guested in Europe. After Costa Mesa, he 
heads to Chicago to conduct the Chicago Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
"This is all very good for me -- and indeed good for the Sydney Symphony -- to 
be seen to be working overseas a lot," he said. "I think it's very important 
that we tour. For so many years, we felt very much out on a limb, by ourselves. 
It's very good for musicians and artists to get out there and show our wares 
and compete in the big world. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only 12 hours on that wonderful direct L.A.-to-Sydney flight. We're 
beginning to feel much more part of the real world." 
</P>
<P>
When he returns home from Chicago, he faces major challenges: first, Wagner's 
"Tristan und Isolde" for the Australian Opera, and then he will lead the 
complete three-act version of Berg's "Lulu" in its first Australian 
presentation. 
</P>
<P>
The opera will be part of a two-month festival, "Mahler, Vienna and the 20th 
Century." Challender believes his country is ready for such major challenges, 
because the music scene there steadily has been upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
"The major trend in Australia is that the standards are rising, and rising 
rapidly. This thrills me," he said. "For many years we kept saying, 'This isn't 
good enough.' We seemed to get no support from the older generation who were 
happy to go on with things the way they were. That's all changing. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a new generation of managers and orchestra personnel and conductors 
and musicians who all want to see things get a lot, lot better. We're working 
very hard. But like all change, it's difficult. There is an older guard who 
thinks, 'Why change? Things have been very fine.' " 
</P>
<P>
Upgrading, of course, costs money. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the first things the new regime did was to raise orchestra salaries," 
Challender said. "They had been allowed to fall behind the rest of the work 
force quite badly. We realized that if wanted to raise the standards, we had to 
pay for it. So we found more money, which was a miracle -- I'm still not sure 
where it came from -- and gave our musicians a very substantial increase in 
salary." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We get more government subsidy than American orchestras, but we 
still have to work very hard to get increased funding. We can't actually use 
private money to pay for salaries. That can only be used to fund special 
programs because the orchestra players are attached to the government through 
the government-funded radio station and so are classified as public servants. 
There are problems there to be solved." 
</P>
<P>
Challender has put an Australian work on the Pacific program -- Richard Mills' 
"Bamaga Dyptich" -- to replace American composer John Corigliano's "Variations 
on an Ostinato." 
</P>
<P>
"I simply did not have enough time to learn that new piece, which I had never 
done before," Challender said. "The (Pacific) agreed to replace it with an 
Australian work by Richard Mills, a young Australian, a very fine, young 
composer, one of our best." 
</P>
<P>
Challender described the 15-minute "Dyptich" as "a brilliant orchestra 
showpiece" for large orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"It's meant to be a pictorial and psychological description of the breaking of 
the dry season in northern Australia," he said. "If you've ever experienced 
those few weeks of intense heat and dryness that lead up to the monsoon season 
in the tropical parts of the world, you know what it means to convey the 
feelings that are associated with that heady atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to describe it in words. It's very easy to describe the pictorial 
part, which is so realistic: rain on the roof and thunder and wind in the palm 
trees. But the psychological part is very deep and personal to the composer who 
lives in a tropical part of Australia and who has experienced it many times: 
What it does on the people, the release and tremendous emotional outpouring 
when finally the rain does start to come down. Everyone goes out and gets 
sopping wet." 
</P>
<P>
He said that while he "never analyzed" how he works in rehearsals, he said that 
"it's very important to have a very clear idea of what you want before you 
enter the rehearsal room, even though perhaps you may change slightly this 
ideal. The acoustical properties of the hall play a big role in the work you 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"But I like to let the musicians' personalities shine through -- as long as 
it's through the framework of what I'm trying to do. There are conductors who 
try to mold everyone into their own image. I like a more collective approach," 
he said. "The rest of it is hard work, basically." 
</P>
<P>
 Sydney Symphony chief conductor Stuart Challender will lead the Pacific 
Symphony in music by Richard Mills, Rachmaninoff and Beethoven at 8 p.m. on 
Wednesday and Thursday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town 
Center Drive, in Costa Mesa. Soloist will be pianist Alexander Toradze.

The consensus of the experts on the Orange County theater scene in the '90s may 
be summed up in two words: more growth. And it will come on both sides of the 
footlights, they predict, in terms of larger audiences and the establishment of 
new troupes at all levels of accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
"A county this big could stand one or two more professional companies," says 
Thomas F. Bradac, artistic director of the Grove Shakespeare Festival in Garden 
Grove. "It's bound to happen, probably in the South County. And I think we'll 
get more cutting-edge type of theaters, storefront places that are willing to 
take chances because they want to make a name for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
At South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, producing artistic director David Emmes 
echoes those views, noting that much of the anticipated growth is a function of 
the countywide "infancy" of the arts. However, since SCR has just come off a 
decade of dramatic institutional expansion, he expects his Tony-winning company 
to do comparatively less growing than others in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to think we are in our artistic maturity," Emmes says. 
</P>
<P>
Only if the Orange County Performing Arts Center gets around to building an 
800-seat drama house -- which is currently under study along with a 2,200-seat 
concert hall -- would SCR be likely to undertake a major new venture in the 
scope of its operations. 
</P>
<P>
"If they decide to go forward with that in the '90s, then that is something we 
would be interested in using," Emmes says. " . . . Saying anything further 
would be to presuppose that the Center is going to want to go ahead with a 
drama house, and I don't know that that is the case at all." 
</P>
<P>
Across the street, Center president Thomas R. Kendrick asserts that plans 
definitely call for the construction of two halls. "Things are going faster 
than anybody thought," he says, referring to the current implementation of a 
$100,000 design study. But just when these plans would be realized remains 
hazy. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Douglas C. Rankin, who heads the Irvine Theatre Operating Co., 
expects the opening of the $17.6-million, 750-seat Irvine Theatre in October, 
1990, to generate a "wave of momentum" for the creation of new theater 
facilities across the county. One indication of that, he notes, is the effort 
now under way in Mission Viejo to explore the possibility of building a 
1,500-seat arts center there. JAN HERMAN

Movie-going in Orange County will be stronger and more mainstream than ever 
over the next decade, industry insiders say, in tandem with an ambitious 
building program by the county's major theater chain. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards Cinema, which operates 200 screens for first-run commercial fare 
throughout Southern California, plans to add another 100 screens during 1990 
alone. Advertising director Bladen Thompson says most will come in Orange 
County, where Edwards now has 105 screens, with the main concentration in South 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the high price of real estate is likely to keep the number of 
art-movie houses basically where it now is for the early '90s. So says Stephen 
Gilula, president of the San Francisco-based Landmark Theatre Corp., which 
operates the Balboa Cinema in Newport Beach and the Port Theatre in Corona del 
Mar among 82 screens nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Landmark expects to reopen the old Fox Theatre movie palace in Fullerton as a 
renovated three-screen complex showing both mainstream and art-house fare in 
late 1990 or early 1991. But the chain doesn't anticipate any further expansion 
in the county over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the market for art films is strong down there," Gilula said, "but not 
strong enough to justify the extremely high cost of real estate. You have to 
have big-grossing films to support that kind of investment." JAN HERMAN

Both Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm will continue in the '90s to tempt 
crowds with new attractions and special events -- an old formula, but one that 
has worked. 
</P>
<P>
Knott's first salvo in the battle for local tourist dollars -- about half the 
visitors at both parks come from Southern California -- will be the Boomerang, 
a roller coaster slated to open next summer on the site of the old Corkscrew. 
Notoriously tight-lipped Disneyland has yet to leak details of its next major 
attraction, although an announcement may come next month. 
</P>
<P>
"There's one thing I can say with certainty: There'll be new things, and we'll 
continue to change," said Jack Lindquist, Disneyland's vice president of 
creative marketing concepts. Among the possibilities: a ride based on the mine 
train chase from the film "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the park will continue its '80s love affair with odd anniversaries 
and character birthdays. Next month, Disneyland begins a yearlong celebration 
of its 35th anniversary, patterned after its highly successful 30th with car 
giveaways, special parades and live entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
While both businesses consider themselves "family" parks, Knott's has developed 
a niche separate from its bigger and better-known neighbor, according to Stuart 
Zanville, the park's director of public relations. "Knott's is a reality park," 
he says. "Disneyland is a fantasy park." Zanville also characterizes Disneyland 
as more ride-oriented, while Knott's will continue to pursue a more "relaxed" 
emphasis on shopping, restaurants and live entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Local tourism should continue strong in the '90s, spokesmen for both parks 
agree. Lindquist cites resort development on the Irvine coast, plans for major 
sports arenas in Anaheim and Santa Ana and a much-discussed high-speed train 
from Anaheim to Las Vegas as potential boosts. Zanville brings up evidence of a 
"mini baby-boom" and predictions of more discretionary income and more leisure 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's going to be a good time for the parks," Zanville said. RICK

For county museums, the '90s are likely to involve addressing a diverse set of 
issues. Staff members at Newport Harbor Art Museum, the Laguna Art Museum and 
the Bowers Museum were asked to comment on a grab bag of prognostications about 
the upcoming decade: 
</P>
<P>
It seems possible that increasing gridlock on the freeways and harried 
two-career households may put a damper on the frequency of family museum treks. 
On the other hand, when they do make the trip, visitors are likely to expect 
more in the way of a "full" cultural and educational experience. 
</P>
<P>
The influx of Asian and Latino residents in Orange County is likely to cause 
museum leaders to ponder how to reach audiences who may have different 
expectations and leisure habits. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, museums will have to continue to come up with new ways of 
introducing children to the arts, essentially doing the job that was once a 
province of the family (now often too busy or unknowledgeable to supervise this 
area of a child's development) and the public schools, which continue to view 
the arts as a "frill." 
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising is a big unknown: Will Orange County be willing and able to keep 
all its cultural institutions afloat? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the '90s may be the decade when "global awareness" -- of major, 
environmental problems as well as political issues -- becomes a foundation of 
museum programming. More than ever, the role of a museum will be to keep our 
heads out of the sand and our minds on the big issues facing the planet, no 
matter how materially satisfying the "good life" of Orange County may be. 
</P>
<P>
At the Newport Harbor Art Museum, outgoing curator Paul Schimmel said: "If not 
wanting to fight the traffic is an ongoing and increasing reality, then our 
audience will rely on artistic venues in Orange County more than (those in) Los 
Angeles or San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
"We'll no longer be a 45-minutes to one-hour experience," he said. " . . .We 
will move from being part of a package of things to see in Newport . . . to 
being a destination." 
</P>
<P>
Schimmel added that the museum is "increasingly playing a more significant role 
in terms of art education in the county." Making adults of varied backgrounds 
feel welcome at the museum "begins through the children," Schimmel said. "They 
bring their parents in." 
</P>
<P>
At the Laguna Art Museum, Director Charles Desmarais said the gridlock issue 
and the changing ethnic makeup of Orange County residents partly motivate his 
hopes of creating another satellite museum site in the South County, to 
complement the one at South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
In regard to fund-raising, Desmarais said: "In the last 10 years, this county 
has done a tremendous job of setting into place a cultural foundation. . . . 
The challenge for the next 10 years will be to build our endowments." 
</P>
<P>
At the Bowers Museum, acting Director Josie de Falla suggested that there will 
be new "issues of how (minority) cultures are presently treated in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
"The museum can even (present) some of the solutions other cultures have 
developed for handling these issues, to provide a framework for the 
difficulties involved in creating a utopian society." 
</P>
<P>
De Falla said fund-raising in the '90s is likely to involve "the education of 
new corporate owners as to philanthropic possibilities" in the arts. The key to 
reaching heads of foreign-owned U.S. businesses may involve exhibitions 
relating to the cultures of their native countries. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of global awareness, De Falla said, the museum might create exhibits 
dealing with such big-ticket ideas as "the nature of ritualized war" as well as 
"smaller issues, like the way other cultures deal with medicine and their 
relationships with nature. 
</P>
<P>
"When we look at the information Voyager is bringing back on our place in the 
universe (we realize) our smallness on one hand and our power on the other 
hand," De Falla said. "The ultimate goal of museums is to be able to portray 
that ultimate contradiction." CATHY CURTIS

The Soviet Union today swiftly condemned the U.S. military assault to seize 
Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, while British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher praised it as a "courageous decision." 
</P>
<P>
"Someone has to uphold democracy," Thatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Reactions contrasted sharply as news flashed around the world that President 
Bush had ordered troops to capture Gen. Noriega, who was indicted on cocaine 
trafficking charges in the United States in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Governments across Latin America strongly criticized the military strike, 
saying it marked a throwback to the days of gunboat diplomacy in the region. 
</P>
<P>
From Mexico to Brazil, the use of force by the so-called "Colossus of the 
North" to settle its dispute with tiny Panama played badly. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, some of the harshest criticism came from countries with generally 
close ties to Washington, such as Venezuela, which said the incursion should be 
"condemned and rejected" by all nations. 
</P>
<P>
Canada expressed regret today about the use of force by the United States in 
Panama but was sympathetic to the American action under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
A statement from External Affairs Minister Joe Clark also said that 
"intervention by force is a dangerous precedent," adding that Canada notes that 
the United States relied on force as a last resort after failing to resolve the 
situation in Panama peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez of Spain said he "deeply lamented" 
the U.S. action. He said the Spanish government, "which always has been opposed 
to foreign military intervention, expresses its hope that the Panamanian people 
can decide their future in freedom." 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P. Perfiliev said, "These actions, 
a violation of the U.N. Charter and generally recognized rules of state 
relations, should be condemned by the international community. The United 
States must immediately stop its armed intervention in Panama."

Sen. David Durenberger (R-Minn.) apologized to the people of Minnesota today 
for a book publishing deal and outside speaking engagements that have come 
under scrutiny by the Senate Ethics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I did that which was legal. But if I give it a smell test, or the light of day 
. . . its linkage with honorarium made it look inappropriate," Durenberger said 
at a news conference. "This suggests to people some kind of inappropriate 
conduct." 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger, who does not face reelection until 1994, said he will not resign 
and expects to be vindicated by the ethics panel. He also said he will pay back 
any money beyond that deemed allowable, although he expects the ethics panel 
will not find that any money should be returned. 
</P>
<P>
Durenberger said he was putting four sons through college and was going through 
a divorce during the time of the possible infractions.

Secretary of State James A. Baker III notified Congress today that the U.S.

A Soviet rocket blasted off today carrying the first U.S. scientific experiment 
to the Mir space station. 
</P>
<P>
Tass press agency said the Progress M-2 cargo rocket lifted off on schedule at 
6:31 a.m. and was functioning normally. It is scheduled to dock with the Mir in 
two days. 
</P>
<P>
Along with food, water and 90 pounds of New Year's presents for two Soviet 
cosmonauts on the Mir, the rocket carries an experiment for growing protein 
crystals in space, developed by Payload Systems of Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Flights of the U.S. space shuttle are too short to grow many kinds of crystals, 
whereas on Mir, the Soviet orbital platform launched in February, 1986, they 
have months to develop.

In one of the biggest East-West spy swaps since World War II, Bonn will release 
four people jailed as Communist agents in exchange for 24 Westerners held in 
East Germany, West German government officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for West German President Richard von Weizsaecker said two former 
secretaries jailed after they passed state secrets to their KGB lovers had been 
pardoned. He could not say whether they had yet been freed. 
</P>
<P>
Bonn's minister for inner-German affairs, Dorothee Wilms, visiting Dresden with 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's delegation, confirmed the spy swap but would not give 
further details. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this means the chapter of prisoners and agents is now ended," she said. 
"That is the prerequisite for the two governments to cooperate in trust."

Upjohn Co. said today it will take an after-tax restructuring charge of about 
$200 million in the fourth quarter to pay for closing down a chemical plant and 
other costs. 
</P>
<P>
The pharmaceuticals company said it will scale back production at its North 
Haven, Conn., Fine Chemical plant, beginning in 1990, as a first stage in a 
three-year phase-out of the operation. It also will record a number of other 
non-recurring charges, including the estimated cost of a previously announced 
early retirement plan for U.S. employees. 
</P>
<P>
"These charges primarily reflect steps we are taking to become more competitive 
in our core pharmaceutical business," Chairman Theodore Cooper said in a 
statement. "They will make us a stronger company in 1990 and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
Kalamazoo, Mich.-based Upjohn said it plans to sell its industrial chemical 
product lines and technologies during 1990.

DOUGLAS WINS $4-BILLION SEOUL HORNET PROJECT

The Defense Ministry today said the government plans to acquire 120 F/A-18 
Hornet fighter planes made by McDonnell Douglas to beef up air defenses in a 
project estimated to be worth more than $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
A ministry official said in a statement that 12 of the advanced U.S. aircraft 
will be purchased directly from the United States. He declined to give details 
on the other 108, saying the ministry is still negotiating terms of purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Lee Sang Hoon later told reporters that he expects 36 of the 
aircraft to be assembled locally from imported McDonnell Douglas parts and 72 
to be produced in South Korea under license. 
</P>
<P>
Samsung Aerospace Industries, which services and supplies parts to engine 
makers Pratt &amp; Whitney and Boeing, has been designated the main contractor. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics vied for years to win the project, 
which, in addition to the initial price tag, would give the company a lucrative 
role in partnering the evolution of the South Korean aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the first aircraft is to roll off the assembly line in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Ministry officials in Seoul said in October that the co-production deal 
had been agreed upon with Washington at a government-to-government level but 
that it could be delayed by opposition in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
South Korea's program follows the controversial FSX co-development project 
between the United States and Japan. In that deal the two governments agreed to 
co-produce an improved version of the F-16 Falcon, but critics said U.S. 
companies were giving away technology and sacrificing American jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The similarities led at least one U.S. senator earlier this year to dub the 
project "son of FSX." 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. critics of the co-production project with South Korea say Seoul 
should purchase all 120 planes to help narrow Washington's trade deficit.

SUEZ SHIPPING RESUMES AS TUGS REFLOAT GROUNDED OIL TANKER

<P>
Shipping resumed in the Suez Canal today after tugs refloated a grounded oil 
tanker that had blocked the waterway for more than 19 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The accident meant both the world's major shipping canals were closed for 
several hours today. After the U.S. intervention in Panama early today, the 
Panama Canal Commission ordered the waterway closed until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberian-registered Lauberhorn ran aground Tuesday shortly after entering 
the waterway connecting the Red Sea with the Mediterranean, coming to rest 
across a narrow curve. 
</P>
<P>
The Greek owners, Base Shipping Service Network, said the 128,000-ton tanker 
ran aground because of poor visibility. 
</P>
<P>
A Suez Canal Authority official said shipping resumed in the canal late this 
afternoon. One convoy of 10 ships was already heading south through the canal. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four ships were waiting at the southern entrance to the canal near the 
port of Suez, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker, its load lightened by the removal of 6,000 tons of oil, was 
refloated in the afternoon as the tide began to rise. 
</P>
<P>
Shipping company officials added that 1,500 tons of oil had leaked from the 
ship and that one of its holds had cracked. There was no sign of oil slicks on 
the canal. 
</P>
<P>
The Suez Canal Authority is asking for $5 million in initial damages, it said. 
Egypt earned $1.3 billion from transit tolls from the canal in 1988.

State Comptroller Gerald Lewis today began legal action to remove David L. Paul 
as chairman of CenTrust Bank of Miami, claiming Paul has used Florida's largest 
savings and loan to support his "opulent life style." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis filed an administrative complaint that seeks removal of Paul as chairman 
of the thrift. Paul has 21 days to either contest the complaint through a state 
hearing or comply with it. 
</P>
<P>
"Paul maintained an opulent life style largely at the expense of the 
association and generally treated a federally insured financial institution and 
public company as it if were his own public piggy bank," Lewis said in the 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint was filed 11 days after federal regulators, also citing 
CenTrust's lavish spending practices, ordered the institution to stop 
squandering its assets on fine art, sailboats, excessive executive salaries and 
other personal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Terence McElroy, spokesman for the comptroller's office, said the action today 
was highly unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's a fairly unusual institution," McElroy said.

The Gillette Co. said today it agreed to buy the Wilkinson razor and blade 
business outside the European Community for $72 million and will take a 22.9% 
non-voting stake in a company acquiring Wilkinson's EC interests. 
</P>
<P>
The seller is Swedish Match, which is shedding all its disposable lighter, 
match and Wilkinson razor and blade business worldwide in a series of 
transactions worth an estimated $672 million. 
</P>

Gillette said it will pay $14 million for its share in a new Dutch company that 
is buying the EC portion of the Wilkinson business as well as all of Swedish 
Match's worldwide match and lighter business. 
</P>

Wilkinson has about 2% of the U.S. blade and razor business compared with 63%

The stock market posted a small loss today, registering no strong reaction to 
the U.S. military action in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.68 to 2,687.93, extending its 
loss over the last five sessions to 73.16 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues nosed out declines in the overall tally on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 763 up, 740 down and 482 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 176.52 million shares, against 186.06 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index edged up .14 to 189.54. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said investors were cautiously watching the situation in Panama but 
apparently not viewing it as any cause to make big changes in their strategies. 
</P>
<P>
They said prospective economic effects of the confrontation, if any, remain 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, brokers said, stock traders appeared to draw only brief 
encouragement from the Commerce Department report that the gross national 
product grew at a 3% annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the third 
quarter of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Economists' projections remained gloomy about results to be posted in the 
fourth quarter and the early stages of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rose in early trading today as traders said the Federal Reserve 
added money to the banking system in a long-awaited signal that it might lower 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond jumped 1/4 point, or $2.50 per $1,000 in 
face amount, by midday. Its yield fell to 7.81% from 7.83% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The key federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for overnight 
loans, dropped to 8 7/16% from about 8 1/2% late Tuesday. Analysts said they 
expected a target of 8 1/4% for the rate. 
</P>
<P>
Economists have expected the Federal Reserve to ease its monetary policy to 
stimulate the sagging economy. The Fed had not added any reserves to the 
banking system with the federal funds rate trading below 8 1/2% since late 
November. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they wanted to give the markets a clear-cut sign," said Kevin 
Flanagan, money market economist with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the credit markets showed little reaction to the U.S. military 
intervention in Panama. Bond prices normally rise in times of instability as 
investors transfer money to long-term fixed investments like bonds.

Judith Jamison, a former dancer in the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater who 
left to work on Broadway and form her own group, was named today as Ailey's 
successor as artistic director of the company. Ailey, who founded the dance 
company 31 years ago, died Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Jamison said at a news conference at the company's school that, earlier this 
year, Ailey told her he wanted her to succeed him. "He said, 'You're going in 
another direction now.' " 
</P>
<P>
"It's like coming home to a place I've been in my heart for years, even if I 
haven't been here physically," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jamison joined the company in 1965, leaving 15 years later to be one of the 
stars of "Duke Ellington's Sophisticated Ladies" on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, she started the Jamison Project, for which she choreographs and

Carroll O'Connor, executive producer and star of the NBC series "In the Heat of 
the Night," says he will take legal action against the tabloid that published a 
story saying that he has fired co-star Howard Rollins. 
</P>
<P>
"The article published in the Dec. 26, 1989, edition of the National Enquirer 
is totally unfounded and deliberately false," said O'Connor. "I am going to sue 
this strange pathogenic publication for its malicious statements." 
</P>
<P>
Rollins entered a hospital several weeks ago after having chest pains. Although 
tests showed he had no coronary problems, the actor decided to take some time 
off, O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all expecting him to return to work in the near future as soon as he is 
able to physically withstand our very strenuous work schedule," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
He called Rollins a "vital part of the series," adding, "I miss him 
professionally and personally and want him back on the set." 
</P>
<P>
David Gerber, chairman and chief executive officer of MGM/UA Television 
Production Group Inc., said the show, which is filmed on location in the 
Covington, Ga., area, may rely on guest appearances by other actors while 
Rollins recuperates.

"We are deeply concerned about Howard's well-being," said Gerber. "The rigors 
of filming a television series can be quite stressful and in order to make sure 
that Howard is physically capable of continuing with his role, we are 
discussing with him whether he can withstand the physical demands of our 
location filming schedule," Gerber said.

Fellow musicians gave Beatle Paul McCartney an award and a standing ovation for 
his contribution to popular music. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney said the recognition Tuesday by the Performing Rights Society, which 
ensures composers receive payments for all public performances of their music, 
was one of the most important he had ever received. 
</P>
<P>
"These are all people who have written great lyrics, and to be honored by them 
is something very special," said McCartney, a society member for more than 25 
years. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney paid tribute to his fellow Beatles -- Ringo Starr, George Harrison 
and the late John Lennon -- and accepted a miniature gold copy of the Hofner 
guitar he made famous. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney, who has just finished the American leg of his first world tour in 13 
years, said the tour is "going marvelously." He said he is particularly looking 
forward to "the British fans, that part is nostalgic." 
</P>
<P>
McCartney's first British concert is Jan. 2 in Birmingham.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: 'MAGIC' DANDRUFF REMEDY NOT YET AVAILABLE IN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Q. When I was in England last winter I had such terrible dandruff I went to see 
a dermatologist. He prescribed a shampoo that cleared my scalp up like magic. 
</P>
<P>
Now the problem has returned. My doctor says I have seborrheic dermatitis, but 
he didn't know what I was talking about when I mentioned the English shampoo. 
The stuff he offered isn't nearly as good. 
</P>
<P>
Please tell me what they use in Europe and how I can get some more. 
</P>
<P>
A. We can't be sure what your English doctor prescribed, but it might well have 
been Nizoral (ketoconazole) shampoo. Although this anti-fungal medicine is 
available in the United States both as a cream and as tablets, it has not yet 
been approved as a shampoo for seborrheic dermatitis or severe dandruff. 
</P>
<P>
There is growing evidence this condition is caused by a yeast infection of the 
scalp, which may explain why Nizoral shampoo is so effective. It is available 
in Belgium, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, Singapore, South Africa and the 
United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you plan to travel abroad, you will have to wait for the Janssen 
pharmaceutical company to receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration to market its unique shampoo in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Q. When will the FDA allow tryptophan to be sold again? I used it successfully 
for insomnia and am upset I can't buy it now. 
</P>
<P>
A. There are now more than 700 cases of EMS (eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome) 
reported in conjunction with tryptophan. This potentially lethal blood and 
muscle disorder has everyone confused. 
</P>
<P>
Although millions of people have used tryptophan safely for years, the reports 
of fever, muscle aches and high blood counts have forced the feds to pull this 
amino acid off the market. Until they get to the bottom of the mystery, no one 
should take tryptophan. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I have had asthma for 60 years, and I try to stay on top of new drugs and 
therapies for my breathing problem. Is there any newsletter that would keep me 
up to date on the latest trends in asthma treatment? 
</P>
<P>
A. We have just come across "Air Currents," a new asthma newsletter. It offers 
practical information and lists resources. For a free copy write to Air 
Currents, Dept. P; 301 East 57th St., New York, NY 10022.

<P>
Outfielder John Kruk has signed a 1990 contract for $615,000 plus bonuses with 
the Philadelphia Phillies, General Manager Lee Thomas announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The Phillies also announced that pitcher Marvin Freeman and outfielder Ron 
Jones have been assigned to the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre Red Barons of the 
International League, and former Phillies outfielder Jerry Martin has been 
hired as coach at Martinsville, Va., of the Appalachian League. 
</P>
<P>
Kruk, 29, came to the Phillies in a three-player trade last June from San 
Diego. He batted .300 with eight homers and 44 RBIs for the season. After 
starting with a .184 average at San Diego, Kruk hit .331 in 81 games with the 
Phillies.

<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Mets traded unhappy center fielder Juan Samuel to the Dodgers 
today for outfielder Mike Marshall and pitcher Alejandro Pena, the Associated 
Press learned. 
</P>
<P>
The trade was to be announced simultaneously in New York and Los Angeles at a 
news conference this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel, 29, was traded to New York from Philadelphia in mid-season, but by the 
end of the year he asked to be traded. He batted .235 with 11 homers and 48 
RBIs and 42 stolen bases in 532 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Samuels had some problems in center field, a position he started playing in 
1988 after five seasons as a second baseman with the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall, who will be 30 next season, batted .260 in 1989 with 11 home runs and 
42 RBIs in 377 at-bats. He has been bothered throughout his career by a bad 
back. In 1988, he played in 144 games and batted .277 with 20 homers and 82 
runs batted in. He hit .293 in 1985 with career highs in homers (28) and RBIs 
(95). 
</P>
<P>
Pena, 30, was 4-3 in 1989 with a 2.13 earned-run average with five saves in 53 
appearances. The right-hander is 38-38 lifetime with 32 saves. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall will make $1 million in 1990 in the second season of a three-year, 
$3.5-million deal. Pena will make $875,000 in the final year of a two-year, 
$2.15-million contract, but the Mets inherit an option for 1991 at $1 million.

A children's swimming coach who met a 13-year-old girl on a so-called telephone 
"talk line" faces six felony charges of sexual misconduct with a minor, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Patrick Pennels, 27, a longtime coach of the Moreno Valley Marlins swim 
club, was charged last week with six felony counts of lewd and lascivious acts 
with a child under 14, Riverside County Assistant Dist. Atty. Guy Pittman said. 
</P>
<P>
Each charge carries a maximum penalty of three, six or eight years in prison. 
Pennels has pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
The girl's mother contacted police late in November after she discovered her 
daughter missing from home late one night and found a letter in the girl's room 
that led her to believe she was having a physical relationship with Pennels. 
</P>
<P>
The Moreno Valley Marlins is a private swim team for youngsters 5 to 18 years 
old. The team competes in the San Gorgonio swim league. Pennels resigned this 
month "for personal reasons," team spokesman Chris Jones said.

NEVADA LOOKS AT INTERSTATE PARI-MUTUEL TRACK BETTING 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal for interstate pari-mutuel betting in Nevada race books makes its 
initial appearance Thursday before the state Gaming Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The Nevada Pari-Mutuel Assn. is asking the commission to schedule a hearing on 
a proposed regulation that would allow sports books to share pari-mutuel 
wagering with California horse racing tracks. 
</P>
<P>
The association, formed by several major Las Vegas resorts, contends that 
approval of pari-mutuel wagering would decrease the risk to legal sports books 
and boost total horse race betting in the books. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Amerine, a former Gaming Control Board member who heads the association, 
said it will allow bettors in Nevada to receive the same odds as bettors at the 
tracks. At present, most race books pay race track odds, but only up to a 
certain limit. 
</P>
<P>
The benefit of pari-mutuel wagering, said Amerine, is that the race book will 
not be at risk. In pari-mutuel wagering, bets are put into a pool and winners 
are paid after a commission for the track and payment of taxes is made. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed regulation, the sports books would share in the commission, 
assuring income to the book without it taking the risk of paying off on long 
odds. 
</P>
<P>
Amerine said most race books do not accept big wagers so they can protect their 
bankrolls and do not offer some bets race tracks offer, such as quinellas.

BASEBALL TAKES LOOK AT OWNERS' PITCH ON PAY: LOW, OUTSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For those of you who never took economics, as I did (twice, just to make sure I 
got it right), I will present a brief lesson in the form of a quiz. 
</P>
<P>
It's multiple choice, so anyone who knows the alphabet up to D has a heck of a 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
Here goes: 
</P>
<P>
If the people who own a company are making more money than they've ever made 
before, and the employees are making more money than they've ever made before, 
what should happen? 
</P>
<P>
A. They have a big party, and party girl Margo Adams jumps out of the cake. 
</P>
<P>
B. They have a big party, and party girl Nadia Comaneci jumps out of the cake. 
</P>
<P>
C. They have a big party, and somebody forgets to buy the cake. 
</P>
<P>
D. They have a lockout-strike, and somebody says, "Let them eat cake." 
</P>
<P>
If you guessed D, you have probably also guessed that our subject is baseball, 
and that only in baseball (or football) is this set of circumstances even 
remotely possible. As it turns out, it's more than remote. Those who have 
studied these labor negotiations suggest that a work stoppage -- a tip: take 
lockout and give the points -- is likely. 
</P>
<P>
How? Why? 
</P>
<P>
This is where it gets sticky. The players wouldn't dare complain they were 
underpaid. How could they? When Pascual Perez signs for about $4 million, you 
try not to say anything. When we do hear from the players, it's usually to trot 
out some loyal soul such as Kent Hrbek to say how he turned down $100 million 
to remain in Minnesota, settling for a paltry $99.5 million instead. 
</P>
<P>
But isn't it equally hard to imagine how the very same team owners who, without 
so much as a bazooka pointed at their heads, are paying out these obscene 
amounts for free agents can rightly complain about players being overpaid? But 
they do. Oh, they do. 
</P>
<P>
And so, as negotiations begin at long last, the owners are asking the players, 
in effect, to handcuff them so they can no longer reach into their pockets and 
willingly give the players all the money they ask for. This would be like 
winning the lottery and having the state ask you to give back the money because 
it could be better spent on snow removal. You'd give it back, right? Right? 
Sure you would. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal on the table is to set up a scale for players with less than six 
years in the big leagues, based on seniority and performance in a formula yet 
to be determined. This would eliminate the need for arbitration, a concept 
originally suggested by the owners, who now see it as a greater evil than 
communism and even free agency. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of which, free agency would remain an option for those with six years' 
experience, but there's a catch: Each team's payroll would be limited under a 
system of revenue-sharing in which the players are paid a 
still-to-be-determined percentage of the clubs' revenue. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, under this system, the owners would be guaranteed a percentage 
of dollars, regardless of how few dollars they make, and the players could see 
major reductions in their salaries. And what is revenue anyway? Does that 
include capital appreciation of the club (the Orioles, as an example, 
appreciated about 500% in less than 10 years). Does it include a cut of beer 
sales? Or does it include just tickets sold to Boy Scouts on week nights? 
</P>
<P>
And, whatever it includes, why should the players accept it? Why should the 
players say they want to take less than someone is willing to pay them? Do the 
Rolling Stones do that? Do you do that? 
</P>
<P>
The owners say the future of the game depends on it. In the National Basketball 
Assn., where the players agreed to a similar system, it did. The league has 
prospered under that system. Baseball has prospered -- no, thrived -- under the 
present system. 
</P>
<P>
The owners continue to insist that, without such a system, only those teams in 
the big markets will be able to afford the best players, and competitive 
balance will die and, without it, so will the game. They insist upon this even 
though George Steinbrenner's New York Yankees last won a pennant in 1981, and 
Joan Kroc's San Diego Padres have won one pennant and the two Chicago teams 
have won a single pennant between them in the postwar era, and since free 
agency began, there hasn't been anything like a dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
This is what is known as the Big Lie. Or maybe the owners actually have talked 
themselves into believing it. Baseball is a business, and it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Autry, an old, rich man whose California Angels have never been to the 
World Series, is willing to pay outlandish amounts to players who might get him 
there. He can afford it. Do you feel sorry for him? For Joan Kroc? For Gussie 
Busch? These people are ultra-rich anyway, and, despite the big salaries, 
they're still making money on their baseball teams. If you can feel sorry for 
these people, you should have been on Leona Helmsley's jury. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the players will make demands. They want players with two years' 
experience, instead of three, to be eligible for arbitration. They want bigger 
pension plans. They want -- and here's something they'll insist on -- some set 
remedy if the owners again collude. 
</P>
<P>
But it seems fairly clear the players aren't going to strike unless the owners 
insist on it. And the betting money is that if the sides can't get together, 
the owners, who can't really believe the players will accept this new proposal 
without some, uh, encouragement, will strike first, locking the players out on 
Opening Day before the players start cashing paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
It's ridiculous. It's absurd. It's a slap in the face to every fan. And it just 
might happen.
