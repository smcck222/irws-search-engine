Slamming the cell doors shut for good, a federal judge Thursday made Warren 
James Bland the first person in California to be sentenced to life in prison 
without parole under a new law that targets repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving imposed the term on Bland, 53, of Los 
Angeles, who had been convicted last month of being a repeat felon in 
possession of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Irving had sentenced Bland to the life without parole term last year but was 
overturned by a federal appeals court, which ruled he erred by telling jurors 
that Bland was wanted in the 1986 killing of a 7-year-old Pasadena girl. At a 
second trial last month, a jury convicted Bland of the gun charge -- his 14th 
felony conviction -- after deliberating for precisely 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"You have, by virtue of your conduct, inflicted cruel and unusual punishment on 
your victims of incalculable proportions, in my view," Irving said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Irving said Bland's victims, many of them women and children, had suffered 
"horrible trauma." Irving added, "I am convinced beyond any possible doubt that 
you must be permanently incarcerated in federal prison. You have earned a 
permanent cell in federal prison." 
</P>
<P>
Bland, 53, who has spent 28 of the past 31 years in prison or mental 
institutions, remained impassive as Irving imposed the term. 
</P>
<P>
After Bland was convicted last month on the gun charge, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Larry Burns, the prosecutor in the case, said that Bland had become the 
"measuring stick for other alleged armed criminal criminals. I hear defense 
attorneys comparing their clients to him, saying, 'He's not a Warren Bland, 
judge, he's not a Warren Bland.' " 
</P>
<P>
In many respects, the hearing Thursday was a rerun of the August 1989 session 
at which Irving first imposed the life without parole term. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, as defense attorney Judy Clarke recited Bland's objections to the 
term, conceding that Bland had a "seriously bad record" but contending it was 
cruel and unusual punishment to impose a "natural death sentence," Irving said, 
"We have been down this road, most of it, before." 
</P>
<P>
As he did last year, Burns urged Irving to impose the no-parole term. He said 
Thursday that Irving could "put an end to Mr. Bland's reign of terror, his 
ability to victimize people." 
</P>
<P>
"It's time for Mr. Bland to go away and not be among us again," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Bland, who spoke last year at length in his defense, declined Thursday to talk. 
Irving, who had made his feelings about Bland known last year, was decidedly 
more brief Thursday in his comments. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Irving called Bland a "vicious, incorrigible predator." Because of 
Bland's bespectacled, grandfatherly appearance, Irving said, Bland is 
"particularly dangerous" and a "wolf in sheep's clothing." 
</P>
<P>
Bland was convicted Nov. 16 under the 4-year-old Armed Career Criminal Act, 
which allows repeat offenders arrested while in possession of a firearm to be 
sentenced to life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
Bland's first felony offense came in 1957, Burns said. According to court 
documents, he has been convicted, among other crimes, of burglary, rape and 
kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, in one three-week period in December, 1959, and 
January, 1960, Bland assaulted a 43-year-old woman, a 46-year-old woman, an 
18-year-old woman and a fourth woman whose age was not listed. He pleaded 
guilty to one count of kidnaping and one count of forcible rape. 
</P>
<P>
In August and November of 1968, about a year after being back on the streets 
and while on parole, Bland embarked upon his next series of rapes and assaults, 
court documents said. He raped a 28-year-old schoolteacher, then a 31-year-old 
woman, then assaulted a 22-year-old woman. The next year he was convicted of 
rape, burglary and kidnaping, court documents said. 
</P>
<P>
Paroled in August, 1975, Bland assaulted an 11-year-old girl and her mother in 
August, 1976, raping the mother and torturing the girl while trying to rape 
her, court documents said. He served three years in prison for assault with 
intent to rape and for kidnaping and was released in April, 1980, documents 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1980, according to court documents, he tortured and molested an 
11-year-old boy. In July, 1981, he was convicted of three felony counts in 
connection with that assault and sentenced to nine years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
He was most recently released from prison in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1987, Bland was wounded and arrested by San Diego police and 
charged in the torture and murder of 7-year-old Phoebe Ho of South Pasadena, 
whose body was found in a Riverside County ditch. She had disappeared while 
walking to school in December, 1986. Bland awaits a preliminary hearing in that 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Bland also has been named as a suspect in the slayings of 14-year-old Wendy 
Osborn of Placentia in Orange County and Ruth M. Ost, 81, of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego police had been looking for Bland on the Riverside County warrant. 
Officers found a gun in his car. 
</P>
<P>
Bland was then charged under the 1986 federal "career criminal" law with 
possession of a gun by a felon with at least three serious convictions.

HAPPY SAILORS RETURN TO S.D. FROM GULF 
</P>

<P>
Mother Nature got in her last licks Thursday morning as the Independence sailed 
into San Diego Bay, the first West Coast-based aircraft carrier to return from 
the Persian Gulf crisis, just in time for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
For weeks on end, she had baked the boys in uniform in the suffocating heat of 
the gulf. Then she nearly froze them solid on their return to usually balmy San 
Diego, hurling a numbing storm to rain on their homecoming parade. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, as the 1,000-foot carrier neared its home berth in Coronado, 
hundreds of sailors manning the deck in a ceremonial human garland broke and 
ran in disarray, scampering in all directions to escape a sudden downpour. 
</P>
<P>
On shore, more than 1,500 wives, mothers, fathers and children waited patiently 
despite the foul weather, clenching wind-whipped welcome-home banners and 
tissues that wiped away more raindrops than tears. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't the way I pictured this day in my dreams, not at all," said 
radioman Alonzo Sims as he shivered on deck in a stiff, wet wind. "But I'll 
take it, anyway. It could be snowing here in San Diego for all I care. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just the happiest day of my life. I'm like a kid at Christmas. I'm 
just so glad to be home." 
</P>
<P>
For many, Thursday's arrival carried special significance. Because this wasn't 
just any ship returning to port in a Navy town. This was an aircraft carrier, 
an imposing steel island carrying enough men to populate a small city. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Independence coming home from a Middle East tour with Battle Group 
Delta, the first major U.S. force to arrive in the area after Iraq's invasion 
of Kuwait last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The 80,000-ton vessel was also the first U.S. aircraft carrier since 1974 to 
operate inside the war-tense Persian Gulf when it passed through the Strait of 
Hormuz on Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
So, when 5,150 thankful sailors breathed a collective sigh of relief to be back 
in San Diego, the sound was sweet and sonorous and almost palpable. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking over our shoulder all the way back," said a smiling ship's 
supply officer Lonnie Mitchell as he held three long-stemmed roses -- one each 
for his wife and two young daughters on shore. 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday morning, when the carrier had the San Diego skyline in sight, 
sailors like 20-year-old Blake Brown of Columbus, Ohio, were daydreaming about 
what the coming night would bring. 
</P>
<P>
Brown was looking for some heavy metal, the music kind. He was just sick and 
tired of the heavy metal bowels of the Independence. 
</P>
<P>
For six months, Brown had endured erratic mail calls that would come seven 
straight days and then not again 
</P>
<P>
for 10 more. When he didn't get a letter from his girlfriend back home, his 
mind would harbor terrible thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
But now he was home. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's party," he said. "We're going to check into a hotel in San Diego. During 
the next 10 days we might see the light of day. But I doubt it." 
</P>
<P>
But not every sailor aboard the Independence had a girl for him on shore. 
"Nobody's waiting for me," said 20-year-old John Gibson. "But we're back. 
That's what counts." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, several sailors were peering through a 6-foot binocular contraption 
known as Big Eyes and used by the lookouts. But nobody was looking for the 
enemy Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"Holy Moley! Look at that babe!" one sailor gasped as he pointed the binoculars 
toward shore. "She's fine, and she knows it." 
</P>
<P>
Below in the carrier's hangar, 50 anxious men also had thoughts of babes on 
their minds. They were the men whose wives had delivered children during their 
absence, and it was the ship's custom to let them off first -- before even the 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
James White's daughter, Ashley Nicole, would be 6 weeks old when he laid eyes 
on her for the first time Thursday. He couldn't wait. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised to hear her name," the Santa Monica man said. "I thought my 
wife and I had agreed to call her Amanda. But she pulled a fast one on me. I 
don't care. When I get in that car and get a good look at her, I know I'm going 
to cry." 
</P>
<P>
Their excitement followed what they called weeks of boredom sitting amid an 
endless expanse of sea without sight of land. They had been stationed in the 
Indian Ocean since June, when the call came to report to the Persian Gulf in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
Then they endured the shimmering Middle Eastern heat that on some summer days 
turned the carrier's black deck into a big black griddle, a frying pan that 
often burned to the touch. 
</P>
<P>
"Some days, it was 114 degrees on that deck. If you touched it, it scorched 
your hand," said Marine Lance Cpl. Steve Allen of Garyburg, N.C. "It got so 
bad, nobody wanted to go up on deck. But, every day, the Marines were out there 
doing our exercises." 
</P>
<P>
On the Independence, Operation Desert Shield meant trying to shield yourself 
from the desert heat -- waiting for the deck parties where they were each 
issued two beers to slake their thirst. Those came every 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
"You had to decide if you wanted to guzzle those beers right down or savor them 
a while," said Samuel Robinson of Austin, Tex. "Most guys just guzzled them 
down the hatch." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the worst sufferers of the heat were the catapultists, the sweaty 
sailors who worked to release the jet fighters that continuously lifted off the 
carrier's deck. "The worst part was the jet blasts, which just added to the 
heat of those terribly hot days," said James White. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys got sick from dehydration. The only way to beat the heat was to 
drink sodas. Between five of us, we drank three cases a day. I don't think I'll 
drink another Coke for at least a year." 
</P>
<P>
Aboard the Independence, thousands of sailors used calendars to mark off their 
days in the Persian Gulf, reading newspapers and watching 2-day-old newscasts 
dispatched from home. 
</P>
<P>
"We really felt like the folks back home were behind us on this trip," said 
seaman Rod Fleege. "Sometimes you go to sea and you feel that people forget 
you're out here. 
</P>
<P>
"But, as soon as we hit the Persian Gulf, the support started coming in, the 
additional letters and videotapes and newspapers. It was good to see." 
</P>
<P>
But there was also frustration. Because of its sudden Persian Gulf assignment, 
the carrier was forced to stay out longer than its scheduled five months. 
</P>
<P>
Men were forced to write letters back home to anxious wives and loved ones 
saying they wouldn't be home on time -- and that, frankly, they didn't know 
when they'd be home. 
</P>
<P>
In sailor-speak, 5,150 sailors were waiting their turn to ditch the GOO -- Gulf 
of Oman -- and head on back to San Dog -- San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In November, after the ship finally left the area, conflicting reports surfaced 
about whether they would be home in time for Christmas. "It was frustrating," 
said Marine Lance Cpl. Lee Dailey, one of 70 Marines assigned to the 
Independence. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd get one date you'd write home about. Then, a week later, you'd have to 
write again and change it." 
</P>
<P>
As the ship neared San Diego, time slowed down. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure the morale gets higher, but the hours go slower because you're looking 
forward to being home so much," said Ed (Dino) DiNatale. "I became a clock 
watcher. We all did." 
</P>
<P>
Russell McKamey, 31, of Sunnymead, stood anxiously in line with gifts he had 
bought in Hong Kong for his new son. Onboard, a counselor had told him to 
expect his son to cry because he was used to being in the arms of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if he cries, I'm going to hold him and squeeze him. Then I'm 
going to squeeze my wife until she cries. Then I'm going to cry. We'll all cry 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"After I stop crying, I'm going to tell my wife how proud of her I am, that 
she's the one who had the tough tour of duty, not me. But I don't know if I'm 
going to be able to talk, I'm going to be all choked up." 
</P>
<P>
In a matter of minutes, McKamey and the other new fathers splashed through 
puddles as they hurried down the gangplank toward their waiting wives. Outside, 
the crowd cheered and screamed in waves as the sailors still on deck whipped 
them into a frenzy with waves and calls. 
</P>
<P>
McKamey, a strapping man who stands over 6-foot-4, waded through the sea of 
expectant faces until his spotted his wife, who had curled her hair for his 
homecoming. His embrace swept her off her feet. 
</P>
<P>
Then he placed her back on earth and gently touched her chin. But he could 
manage only three words when he whispered in her ear. 
</P>
<P>
She smiled and hugged him back. 
</P>
<P>
"I know," she said.

WEEKEND VOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
German voters went to the polls on Dec. 2 and 78% of 59.9 million eligible 
voters (reportedly the lowest turnout since 1949) cast their ballots. 
</P>
<P>
Isn't it about time that we Americans are allowed to vote on a Saturday or 
Sunday also? Our low voter turnout is a national disgrace and embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
And while we are in the mood for a change, let's also have door-to-door voter 
registration like they do in Canada. People who are registered are much more 
likely to vote. 
</P>
<P>
Expect much opposition and howls of rage from our current power structure, 
however, if ordinary Americans try to change the current comfy 
vote-on-a-weekday arrangement, which makes it very difficult for long-distance 
commuters and working couples to get to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
Our ruling class is quite happy to govern without the consent of a large 
percentage of the governed.

U.S. ENERGY POLICY AND NUCLEAR PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial ("New Designs Are Great, but Where Does the Waste Go?" Dec. 10) 
states "the new designs look good on paper." I don't know whether to laugh or 
cry. 
</P>
<P>
I can assure you that the old designs looked good on paper, too. I know. I was 
a quality control inspector at San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS). 
</P>
<P>
I started out enthusiastic about an industry that promised to deliver us from 
dependence on fossil fuels. Over time, I learned that the builders and 
regulators of nuclear energy have been unable or unwilling to transform a good 
plan into a good, safe nuclear generating plant. 
</P>
<P>
A part of the reason is that the pro-nuclear groups (builders, operators and 
the naive public and politicians) overstate the benefits and minimize the 
problem of nuclear energy production. 
</P>
<P>
I am a witness and can document numerous instances of intentional obfuscation 
and cover-ups. 
</P>
<P>
How many people who support nuclear energy realize the plants must be shut down 
after only 30 or so years? They will have absorbed enough radiation to be 
dangerous for thousands of years. The costs to decommission are not included in 
the estimated cost of building or operating the plants. As you have correctly 
pointed out, spent fuel is another problem the pro-nuclear voices are silent 
on. 
</P>
<P>
America needs a cohesive, effective, environmentally benign energy policy. 
Where are the leaders with enough vision to make this issue a top priority? The 
nation that solves the complex problems of energy and environment will be the 
nation that leads the world during the 21st Century. Sadly, the U.S. plods 
along without direction and without a vision.

CONTROVERSY OVER DOLPHINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My comments concern the Dec. 6 column of Al Martinez, "Lo, the Endangered 
Company." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Martinez writes for a satirical effect. 
</P>
<P>
But his obvious lack of understanding of the problem connected with drift nets 
is reckless journalism. 
</P>
<P>
What StarKist and Chicken of the Sea have promised not to do is purchase tuna 
captured in a particular type of net, purse seine fish nets. This type of net 
is used to capture yellowtail tuna, which are attracted to dolphins. Fishermen 
seek schools of dolphins knowing yellowtail are present as well, drop a net 
that completely surrounds the school of dolphins and yellowtail and then pull 
them all on board. The effects on the dolphin and other marine mammals is 
fatal. 
</P>
<P>
Although I am not personally a member of any environmental group, I would 
certainly advocate for there to be a solid scientific foundation for any 
environmentalist claims. Martinez, on the other hand, had the opportunity to 
"research" this topic more thoroughly than a call to Bumble Bee. 
</P>
<P>
By not weeding the chaff from the seeds in environmental claims, Martinez takes 
an Archie Bunker armchair approach. Very disappointing for a man in your 
position, Martinez.

The Kings were dropping faster than the temperature Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky: Playing injured with a bruised calf. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Granato: On a plane home with a stomach injury. 
</P>
<P>
Tomas Sandstrom, Marty McSorley, Bob Halkidis and Rick Hayward and Frank

<P>
Already in a 1-5-4 slump and coming into the home of the Smythe 
Division-leading Flames, the beat-up Kings figured to have about as much chance 
Thursday night as marathon runner in the streets of Calgary where the 
temperature was down to 36 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
And indeed, after 59 minutes, the Kings trailed the Flames by a goal. 
</P>
<P>
But in their biggest comeback of the season, the Kings, down by two goals at 
one point, got one from Steve Duchesne to tie with a minute to play and a goal 
from Luc Robitaille to win in overtime, 4-3, before a stunned Olympic 
Saddledome crowd of 20,132.

"It was a big victory," an elated Robitaille said. "With so many of our guys 
missing, we wanted to show we're still pretty good. We played on pride." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was Rick Wamsley, the Calgary goalie who has turned the Kings 
away so many times before, who lost the puck on both of the big scores. 
</P>
<P>
He had a lifetime record of 14-6 in the regular season against the Kings coming 
in and seemed to have his 15th victory in hand when Duchesne came skating down 
the left side, went around defender Al MacInnis and fired at the Calgary goal. 
</P>
<P>
Wamsley blocked the shot and came out of the net to clear it off the left 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
But he never saw Robitaille until it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I surprised him," Robitaille said. 
</P>
<P>
No kidding. 
</P>
<P>
The King wing stole the puck and fed it back out to Duchesne in the left 
circle. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the King defenseman didn't miss, not with Wamsley unable to recover 
and get back in goal. 
</P>
<P>
The puck slammed into the right side of the net for Duchesne's 10th goal. 
</P>
<P>
In the overtime, Coach Tom Webster, suddenly faced with the prospect of 
salvaging at least one point out of what had seemed like a disastrous night, 
played conservatively. 
</P>
<P>
But when the puck was shot out into the neutral zone, the Kings had their 
window of opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille followed the puck across the red line, then across the blue line. 
</P>
<P>
Wamsley came out to meet him, a full 20 feet from the net. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames goalie reached the puck first, but instead of clearing it to the 
side, he shot it right onto Robitaille's stick. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Wayne put a glare in his eyes," Robitaille said with a wide grin on 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
That was in reference to a story earlier in the day in the Calgary Herald in 
which Wamsley had complained that the glare from Gretzky's new aluminum stick 
could be blinding on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
Wamsley later denied he had said that, but there was no denying his mistake at 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
Given the puck, Robitaille whizzed by Wamsley and was staring at an open net. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't stare long, smashing in his 17th goal with 1:17 left in the overtime 
to boost the Kings' record to 18-10-5 and move them within three points of 
Calgary (20-12-4). 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' other goals were scored by Gretzky, (his 21st) and Todd Elik (10th). 
Calgary's goals came from Sergei Makarov (11th), Joe Nieuwendyk (20th) and 
Jamie Macoun (fifth). 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, the Kings headed out into the night to fly to their next game 
in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
It hadn't gotten any warmer, but for the Kings, it was like a day at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Wing Tomas Sandstrom is not expected back until at least the second week in 
January, according to Coach Tom Webster. When Sandstrom fractured his back on 
Nov. 29, club officials said he could be back in a minimum of one to two weeks. 
Webster now concedes that was "very optimistic." Sandstrom has resumed skating. 
. . . Tony Granato flew home Thursday when it became difficult for him to 
breathe without pain. "I think I did it to myself," he said earlier in the day 
in describing the stomach injury. "I went to cross-check somebody (in the game 
at Edmonton Tuesday) and felt something pull. That was in the first period. We 
tried taping it, but it got worse and worse. I went out in the third period 
because I wasn't doing anybody any good by then." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Breault injured his knee in the Calgary game on Dec. 13. Arthroscopic 
surgery Wednesday revealed the extent of his injury, so Dr. Steve Lombardo 
proceeded with the major surgery that will keep Breault out nine months. . . . 
Defenseman Marty McSorley has been medically cleared to play, but has remained 
home because of continued soreness in the rib area. . . . Bob Halkidis has a 
knee injury, Rick Hayward a bad shoulder. . . . Unlike Scott Bjugstad, 
defenseman Brent Thompson didn't have far to go when the Kings called him up 
Wednesday. Thompson, a 19-year-old junior, plays for the Medicine Hat Tigers. 
But he was already in Calgary as a member of Canada's national junior team. 
Thompson was cut from the national team Tuesday, so he simply switched 
uniforms. . . . Garry Unger, who had served as interim head coach of the Kings' 
New Haven farm team, returns to his old job as an assistant coach with the 
Phoenix Roadrunners with the naming Wednesday of Pat Hickey and Nick Fotiu as 
co-coaches at New Haven.

MORNING BRIEFING: HE'S THROWING THE BOOK AT THE SOONERS AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"The Games Behind the Game," a book by Walter Byers, executive director of the 
NCAA from 1951 to 1987, will be published in late summer or early fall of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Associated Press, the book "will deal with his suggestions for 
reform in collegiate athletics as well as look at the personalities, economic 
power and politics that influence intercollegiate sports." 
</P>
<P>
Is it ironic -- or fitting -- that "The Games Behind the Game" will be 
published by the University of Oklahoma Press? 
</P>
<P>
He broke the story: There was Woodward, there was Bernstein and now there's 
Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Bailey of the Providence Journal-Bulletin, another in the growing legion 
of collectibles columnists, wrote in his "Collector's Corner" of Dec. 8: "Way 
back on Oct. 7, we provided a peek at what Topps is planning for 1991 -- a 
special 40th anniversary production that mixes 792 new cards with bonus samples 
of every card produced during the past four decades." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: There have been no tie games in the NFL this season. When was the 
last time the league went a full season without a tie? 
</P>
<P>
Way back payback: After Miami's recent 23-20 overtime victory over 
Philadelphia, the Dolphins' Jim Jensen said teammate Jeff Cross told him an 
Eagle had said Coach Buddy Ryan offered $100 to the defensive player making the 
best hit on Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ron Howard, the Eagles' media relations director: "This has absolutely 
nothing to do with Buddy Ryan. Our players felt Jim was a jerk. There was no 
bounty on him, but our players thought, yeah, if we can get a good shot on him 
within the legality of the rules and in the spirit of play, they would take 
one." 
</P>
<P>
Howard said the Eagle players were angry at Jensen for playing too rough in an 
off-season "Best of the Beach" basketball game in Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
Add "bounty": Wednesday, the Eagles wore T-shirts that read, "Buddy's Bounty 
Hunters." 
</P>
<P>
Said guard Mike Schad: "We just found them in our lockers today. Buddy said an 
anonymous guy brought them in in a box and gave them to the PR department." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ryan: "Nobody gave me one." 
</P>
<P>
Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson, who last year accused Ryan of putting a bounty on 
Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman and kicker Luis Zendejas, commented on the 
T-shirts: "Was that the bounty on us or was that the one on (Jensen) we heard 
about this year?" 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys and Eagles play Sunday in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: 1985. 
</P>

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: FROM SAUDI ARABIA TO THE SIDELINES, NBC TURNS ON THE 
JUICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART

<TEXT>
<P>
Football came easy to O.J. Simpson. Broadcasting did not. 
</P>
<P>
He struggled, but never gave up, even when things looked bleak. One critic 
wrote that Simpson sounded as if he had a brick wall between his brain and his 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
The critics aren't picking on Simpson now. In fact, NBC executives are raving 
about him, calling him both a team player and a star. 
</P>
<P>
He's been to Saudi Arabia to visit the troops; he's been on the sidelines 
digging up information on injured quarterbacks; he's been hustling and going 
after stories and he's showing, by gosh, he is a good broadcaster after all. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson concedes that he's having his best year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more relaxed because I understand my responsibilities better than ever 
before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, on NBC's "NFL Live," the emphasis was on Bob Costas and "insiders" 
Bobby Beathard and Ralph Wiley. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes there'd be eight seconds left, and they'd say, 'Go to O.J.,' " 
Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, the second segment is all mine. They tell me what they want, then 
leave it up to me and my producer, Kevin Smollon." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson spent this week working on a Bo Jackson piece that will be seen on "NFL 
Live" Saturday at 12:30, before the Raiders' game at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"We like it that people, whether it's Bo Jackson or the troops in Saudi Arabia, 
feel at ease with O.J.," said Terry O'Neil, NBC Sports' executive producer. "We 
also think that viewers who have grown up with O.J. feel comfortable with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a big difference for O.J. on 'NFL Live' this year is the addition of 
Will McDonough. They play off each other very well." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson also gives a lot of credit to McDonough. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just what we do on the air," he said. "We watch games together and 
exchange ideas." 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Simpson was assigned to work the sideline at Giants Stadium, 
where Buffalo played New York. Usually, sideline reporters get about 30 seconds 
to offer little more than a few cliches. 
</P>
<P>
But after both quarterbacks, Buffalo's Jim Kelly and New York's Phil Simms, 
went down with injuries, Simpson became a major player. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't even supposed to be down on the sideline," he said. "I kept having to 
change umbrellas so the league officials upstairs couldn't spot me. I got 
thrown off the field once." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Simpson was able to get information on the injuries, and he even had a 
beer with Kelly in the trainer's room. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, he made about a dozen calls tracking down Kelly and persuaded him 
to do a phone interview on "NFL Live." 
</P>
<P>
"I told him I'd play in his golf tournament if he'd come on the air," Simpson 
said. "So I guess I'll be in Buffalo in June." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson's work last weekend has drawn him sideline assignments this weekend -- 
Saturday at the Metrodome and Sunday at Rich Stadium in Buffalo, where the 
Bills play Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"The Metrodome is OK, but do you know how cold it will be on the field at Rich 
Stadium?" Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
He's not really complaining, though. 
</P>
<P>
"I groaned and moaned when they said they were sending me to Saudi Arabia, and 
I groaned and moaned when they said I was going to be on the sideline last 
Saturday," Simpson said. "But to tell you the truth I've gotten a kick out of 
being out where the action is." 
</P>
<P>
There is a certain kinship between Simpson and Bill Walsh, and not just because 
Walsh coached Simpson briefly with the San Francisco 49ers. Walsh, like 
Simpson, went from a field where he excelled to one where he is struggling. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, however, says he believes Walsh will stay in broadcasting and not 
return to coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Bill would prefer to succeed on TV and not have to go back to 
coaching," he said. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's O'Neil said a decision about Walsh's status with the network will be made 
after the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't talk until then because we don't want to distract him during the 
season," O'Neil said. 
</P>
<P>
A new coaching rumor about Walsh is that he will end up in San Diego. Charger 
officials are saying Coach Dan Henning, who has three years left on his 
contract, is on solid ground, but an NBC source said Walsh and Beathard, now 
the Chargers' general manager, have talked. 
</P>
<P>
Angel announcers: Now that Channel 5 has hired an Angel play-by-play announcer, 
Ken Wilson, the next step is to find a commentator. Johnny Bench is the leading 
candidate, with Jay Johnstone and Bob Gibson high on the list. And there still 
is a possibility that Reggie Jackson will be back. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Quasarano, Channel 5's executive sports producer, said he hopes to decide 
by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who has done baseball in St. Louis, Cincinnati and Seattle, got his 
first baseball announcing job in 1970 with the Hawaii Islanders. Al Michaels 
hired him. 
</P>
<P>
"I was headed into my third year with the Islanders when Ken, a disc jockey in 
Honolulu, applied for a job," Michaels said. "I asked him if he knew who Mike 
Fiore was? He knew that Fiore was a Kansas City utility man, so I hired him." 
</P>
<P>
Hard to figure: USC quarterback Todd Marinovich is among the personalities 
profiled on "First Person with Maria Shriver" on NBC Sunday night at 8. 
</P>
<P>
In doing the piece, an NBC crew had more than a few problems trying to track 
down Marinovich. Once, it went to a math class to film him, only Marinovich 
wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
Said Marinovich: "What math class? I have a math class? I can't stand math." 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
With the Raiders playing at Minnesota on Saturday and the Rams at Atlanta on 
Sunday, Los Angeles gets an extra NFL telecast Sunday -- New Orleans at San 
Francisco on Channel 2 at 1 p.m. Newcomer Brad Nessler and Dan Jiggetts will 
announce the Ram-Falcon game, Verne Lundquist and John Madden the Saint-49er 
game. Lundquist is filling in for Pat Summerall, who is still hospitalized with 
a bleeding ulcer. Jack Buck has taken over Lundquist's assignments. Summerall 
is expected to be home for Christmas, but his work status is undetermined. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS game on Saturday is Detroit at Green Bay, with James Brown and Randy 
Cross reporting. And don't forget, because of Christmas Eve, "Monday Night 
Football" falls on Saturday this weekend, with Washington at Indianapolis at 5 
p.m. . . . The big game on Sunday is Miami at Buffalo on NBC at 10 a.m., with 
Marv Albert and Paul Maguire. The ESPN game Sunday evening is Denver at 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
With all the college basketball on television, it's amazing that UCLA at Iowa 
Saturday at 5 p.m. isn't on somewhere. . . . The highlight of the Christmas Day 
lineup is the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls on NBC at noon, with Albert and 
Mike Fratello reporting. Fratello said, "It's been a long time since we did the 
Lakers and Spurs the first weekend of the season, so being able to do the 
Clippers (for Channel 5) has really worked out well." . . . KLAC offers the NBA 
radio network's coverage of the Pistons and Bulls, with Joe McConnell and Frank 
Layden announcing. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Ticket kicks off a USC-UCLA football marathon at 4 p.m. Christmas Day 
with a full replay of this year's game. Following are six hours of highlights 
from other games during the last decade. Prime Ticket will send tapes of the 
football marathon to troops in Saudi Arabia. . . . Other Christmas Day 
highlights include an ABC football doubleheader -- the Blue-Gray game at 9 a.m. 
followed at 12:30 by Syracuse and Arizona in the Aloha Bowl -- and a two-hour 
special, "The Best of SportsCenter '90," on ESPN at 5 p.m. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Fred Roggin has completed taping the first six half-hour segments of "Roggin's 
Heroes," an MCA-distributed series being syndicated to 145 markets for Saturday 
night showing, beginning Jan. 12. The shows are similar to Roggin's year-end 
specials. But instead of getting one a year, Roggin fans will be getting one 
every week. . . . Chris Marlowe, drawing his first Prime Ticket boxing 
assignment, did nice work on Wednesday night's stunner at the Forum, in which 
Rolando Pascua knocked out Humberto Gonzalez. . . . Beginning Jan. 1, Prime 
Ticket will replay "Press Box" nightly at 1:30 or 2. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN boxing commentator Al Bernstein has joined the KVEG lineup that includes 
Fred Wallin, Rick Talley and Peter Vent. Bernstein's show, which began this 
week on the 50,000-watt Las Vegas radio station, is on weekdays, 3 to 4 p.m. . 
. . Ed (Superfan) Bieler has talked with KTMS in Santa Barbara about 
employment. The station's talk-show host, Jim Rome, left to join XTRA in San 
Diego, and Randy Rosenbloom is filling in. . . . CBS has announced that it will 
again televise only 16 regular-season baseball games, beginning April 20.

LOYOLA MAKES BIG RUN AT LSU BUT STUMBLES AT THE END, 122-114; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: LIONS PLAY THEIR BEST GAME OF THE YEAR AGAINST 10TH-RANKED 
TIGERS. LOWERY SCORES 40 POINTS AGAIN.

<P>
Louisiana State students chanted "Tiger bait, tiger bait," as Loyola Marymount 
took the floor here Thursday, and for most of the game the Lions baited the 
Tigers exceedingly well. 
</P>
<P>
Playing their best game of the season, the Lions played on even terms with 
10th-ranked LSU, eventually falling, 122-114, before a crowd of 13,044 at the 
Pete Maravich Assembly Center. 
</P>
<P>
It was Loyola's third loss in a row against a top 20 team, but after defeats at 
UCLA and Oklahoma totaling 111 points, the Lions set the pace in this game and 
avoided the all-out Big Shaq Attack they feared. 
</P>
<P>
Shaquille O'Neal, LSU's dominating center, finished with 29 points and 14 
rebounds, most of that in the final eight minutes as the Tigers pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's Terrell Lowery scored 40 points for the second game in a row and the 
fourth time in eight games. He and guard Craig Holt (17 points) combined to hit 
11 of 23 three-point baskets, part of the formula for Loyola's good showing. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very pleased with our effort," Lion Coach Jay Hillock said. "Our style 
hurt them a little bit. If we can take a couple more steps we can do what I 
want to do, which is be a factor in our conference." 
</P>
<P>
LSU Coach Dale Brown said it was "the best I've seen Loyola play all year long, 
by far. They dictated most of the game with their up-beat style. Lowery's 
performance in the first half was brilliant." 
</P>
<P>
The teams were tied, 57-57, at halftime -- Lowery had 25 -- and LSU led by only 
three points before putting together a decisive 12-3 run to build a 99-87 lead. 
Loyola never got closer then seven after that. O'Neal, who had only eight 
points at halftime, had a series of monstrous dunks down the stretch and the 
Lions finally wilted against the taller home team. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected to tire 'em out," Lowery said. "They happened to hold up and push 
through. The bigger bodies took a toll. I think they outmanned us a little at 
the end." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Vernel Singleton had a career-high 26 points and 12 rebounds for LSU 
(6-1) as the Tigers controlled the boards, 48-31. Defensive specialist Shawn 
Griggs had 20 points, eight assists and a Southeastern Conference record eight 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
Center Richard Petruska, in his best performance, had 18 points and eight 
rebounds for the Lions (2-6) and made eight of 12 shots as Loyola shot 55%. 
Lowery added 14 assists. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions continue their road swing against highly rated teams with a game 
Saturday at Georgia Tech. For a change, they go in with some confidence despite 
Thursday's loss. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big-time motivation builder," Lowery said. "We had taken a couple of 
beatings. It's evident we hadn't played up to our potential. We were just 
waiting for a game like this, for it to come together. I'm looking forward to 
(playing Georgia Tech's) Kenny Anderson."

<P>
Isiah Thomas played in this tournament. So did Mark Aguirre, Terry Cummings, 
James Edwards, Terry Teagle, Sleepy Floyd and William Bedford. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, it was known as the Cabrillo Classic, and some of the visiting 
coaches were Georgetown's John Thompson, DePaul's Ray Meyer, Indiana's Bobby 
Knight, Michigan State's Jud Heathcote and Villanova's Rollie Massimino. 
</P>
<P>
After three name changes, it is called the Texaco Star Classic, and the 15th 
edition of the tournament tips off at 6 tonight at the San Diego Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect to recognize many of these teams or players. The first game 
features Lamar (5-3) against Drexel (1-6). San Diego State plays Arkansas State 
(5-3) at 8:30 in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
"You always worry about a tournament when it doesn't have good name 
recognition, but please, all of our basketball fans have to recognize what 
these teams have done this year," SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg said. 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Lamar and Arkansas State's winning records. 
</P>
<P>
John Wadas, the SDSU associate athletic director who coordinates the basketball 
schedule, said at various times the Aztecs thought they had Georgetown, Ohio 
State and Oklahoma State committed to play in this year's tournament. But for 
various reasons, none of the three worked out. 
</P>
<P>
According to Wadas: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ohio State verbally committed, and things were so close to being wrapped up 
that Wadas sent the paperwork out. But then the Buckeyes changed coaches, and 
new Coach Randy Ayers wasn't interested in the tournament. Wadas said Ohio 
State backed out "last January or February." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Georgetown expressed an interest in coming to San Diego, but the Hoyas 
decided to open their season with two games in Hawaii instead -- at Hawaii Loa 
and Hawaii Pacific. Wadas said Georgetown said no in April. 
</P>
<P>
-Oklahoma State was also close, but after several conversations between Wadas 
and Coach Eddie Sutton, the Cowboys decided to play in the Old Style Classic in 
Chicago, along with DePaul, Wisconsin-Green Bay and Southern Illinois. Wadas 
said the Cowboys dropped in midsummer. At the last moment, Lamar was added to 
this year's field. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament used to be the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, but 
SDSU moved it up a week this year so it would not be fighting for publicity 
with the Holiday Bowl. It will remain the weekend before Christmas for at least 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem we found out as we got into this year is that a number of schools 
have finals and have problems traveling this week," Wadas said. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is with the scramble for television games, schools typically 
juggle their schedules right up until the start of the season. SDSU was 
supposed to play at North Carolina last season but, when the Atlantic Coast 
Conference-Big East challenge was organized for ESPN, the Tar Heels postponed 
SDSU until this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Classic has become a profitable tournament for SDSU since Texaco has become 
a corporate sponsor. Jim Herrick, SDSU associate athletic director/business 
affairs, said the school lost about $2,000 on the tournament in 1988 but, when 
Texaco got involved to a larger extent last year, SDSU made about $29,000. 
</P>
<P>
Whether this year's field, without marquee teams, will attract many fans 
remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still a championship event and a good experience, I believe, for the 
athletes," he said. "Our guys are going to be playing in a (Western Athletic 
Conference) tournament later on. Tournament experience is important. You need 
to know what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
As for the tournament's future, Wadas said South Carolina is committed for next 
year, and Texas has agreed to participate two years from now.

BERNSTINE ACTIVATION UP IN THE AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Running back Rod Bernstine said Thursday he "doesn't have a clue" if the 
Chargers are going to activate him this week. 
</P>
<P>
And to hear Coach Dan Henning talk, it's no wonder why. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned about Les Miller's back, and if we use one of our moves with 
Rod, we have to save the other one just in case we have a quarterback problem 
next week," Henning said. "You get Billy Joe Tolliver hurt and you'd want to 
use the move for John Friesz. 
</P>
<P>
"If we move Rod up we'd be shorting ourselves a defensive player and a special 
teams player. It might turn out we have to make a move with (linebacker) 
Richard Brown and wait on Rod." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Henning doesn't have a clue what the Chargers are going to do. 
</P>
<P>
He's concerned about Miller's sore back, and might try to sneak linebacker Jeff 
Mills through waivers. If Marion Butts can play, then there's less urgency to 
use one of the team's final two free moves on Bernstine. 
</P>
<P>
Follow? 
</P>
<P>
Henning said Butts is suffering from a ligament problem in his foot. He said 
Butts did not practice, and there remains concern about his long-term health 
should he try to play on the sore foot. 
</P>
<P>
"Now he's out here jogging and subjectively he says, 'I feel pretty good.' But 
he's not pounding away 250 pounds and the adrenaline's flowing," Henning said. 
"The doctors are still vacillating and if there's any vacillation whatsoever, 
it's going to go in the other direction. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say at this point it's unlikely he's going to play. They've got to 
give me a clean bill of health on that guy to take that kind of chance right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said Bernstine (hamstring) looks pretty good, and Bernstine said he 
felt good running Thursday. "I don't know if I'm 100% or 80%," he said. "I 
don't know what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Take a number. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said he has talked to his team about reports out of Kansas City that 
the Chiefs are wary of the "cheap-shot Chargers." 
</P>
<P>
"I took everybody aside," Henning said. "We have some feedback from their media 
that their players said our players were taking cheap shots. "Well, I have film 
to prove the opposite is true. We're the ones who got penalized for most of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Chargers' tight end Arthur Cox drew a penalty for kicking a defender after 
being tackled, and Kansas City linebacker Derrick Thomas was penalized for 
throwing a punch. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to play as hard and as strong as we can, but we don't want to be 
kicking (below the belt) and punching in the face as they had done in that ball 
game," Henning said. "Those are the ones that the officials are likely to see. 
Don't take any (grief) and play as hard as you can within the rules." 
</P>
<P>
Nose tackle Les Miller was scheduled to undergo testing on his back Thursday, 
but the 300-pounder balked when he couldn't fit in one of the medical machines. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted to grease me up to fit in it," Miller said. "I said any machine 
that needs me to get greased up isn't made for me." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he's been bothered by his back for the past three weeks, but said 
it felt better this week. He remains questionable for the game. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Nate Lewis, who had been listed as doubtful with a wrist injury, 
was upgraded to questionable. T.J. SIMERS

TOWNSEND EARNED START IN PRO BOWL

<P>
Although four Raiders were named to the Pro Bowl, defensive end Greg Townsend 
was the only Raider voted into the starting lineup. An integral part of the 
Raider pass rush, Townsend has a career-high 12.5 sacks this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt he should have made it last year but he didn't," Coach Art Shell said. 
"Now the players know who he is and respect him." 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota Viking Coach Jerry Burns, under fire because of the Vikings' collapse 
this season, says he wants to return next season. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time earlier in the season when I was pretty discouraged about the 
way things were going," Burns said. "It seemed like everything we did was 
backfiring on us and we had a lot of internal problems." 
</P>
<P>
But after losing six of their first seven games, the Vikings won five in a row, 
rekindling Burns' enthusiasm. Burns, 63, the NFL's oldest head coach, has a 
44-33 record since succeeding Bud Grant in 1986. CHRIS BAKER

Coach John Robinson said Thursday that Gaston Green and Cleveland Gary will 
split time at tailback Sunday at Atlanta, with Green getting the starting nod. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just going to be an even thing," Robinson said, emphasizing that neither 
Green nor Gary is ahead of the other in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Injury report: Recently signed Bruce Klostermann will replace injured Frank 
Stams at one inside linebacker spot, Robinson said, with veteran Brett 
Faryniarz going in on passing downs. The Rams will decide today whether 
starting left guard Tom Newberry, who injured an ankle last week, can play 
Sunday. Bern Brostek, this year's No. 1 pick, will play considerably at left 
guard either way. Newberry and tight end Damone Johnson (hamstring) are both 
listed as questionable. 
</P>
<P>
For the Falcons, defensive end Mike Gann (foot) is listed as doubtful. 
Quarterback Scott Campbell (shoulder), Pro Bowl receiver Andre Rison (knee) and 
running back Steve Broussard (hamstring) are all questionable. TIM KAWAKAMI

IT'S A DO-OR-DIE WEEKEND FOR STORES HOPING TO LIFT SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After nearly a month of disheartening holiday sales, Southland merchants are 
bracing for what they hope will be a three-day sales blitz, the retail 
equivalent of hanging shiny new ornaments on an otherwise sagging Christmas 
tree. 
</P>
<P>
Hit hard by the economic slowdown, department store executives and small 
shopkeepers alike say they hope that the malls will bustle and cash registers 
will ring starting Saturday and running through Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers who have postponed making gift-buying decisions will finally be 
forced to act -- or wait until next year. Merchants, forced to keep sweetening 
the pot with sales and discounts, will have one final chance to move 
merchandise off the shelves before having to slash prices for after-Christmas 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think (merchants) have faced a time in recent memory where three days 
have been more important to them. This can be the difference between an OK 
Christmas and a very disappointing year," said Richard Giss, partner-in-charge 
of the Retailing Services Group for the accounting firm Deloitte &amp; Touche 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As if to foretell the comeback, the blast of cold arctic air this week was 
being welcomed by store owners as a way to put people into the Christmas 
spirit, into malls and into expensive jackets and ski gear. 
</P>
<P>
The calendar is also giving retailers reason to keep fingers tightly crossed. 
The season has been a little longer, with five weekends since Thanksgiving Day 
instead of four. And more important, since Christmas Day falls on Tuesday, 
shoppers are likely to take Monday off or work only a partial day. As a result, 
merchants believe that Christmas Eve may be one of the busiest shopping days 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
A three-day shopping period before a holiday typically adds 6% to 8% to sales 
revenue for the month, said Rita Mincavage, manager of merchandise publicity 
for J. C. Penney's Southern California stores. "You can say that about any 
holiday, but what's really nice is this holiday is Christmas," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Although the busy Christmas Eve shopping day could add a lift to sales, 
retailing executives say they would rather have seen the buying season pick up 
speed earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly a big plus as far as shopping goes, but it's a mixed blessing 
because it makes it more likely people will put off their shopping and 
retailers would like to see them get in there early," said E. Harlin Smith, a 
spokesman for Carter Hawley Hale Stores, owner of the Broadway Southern 
California, Weinstock's, Emporium and Broadway Southwest chains. 
</P>
<P>
Late or not, every sale will be appreciated as merchants reel from the weak 
economy and heavy debt from the takeover wars. 
</P>
<P>
Department stores and others have responded by increasingly upping the ante to 
try to lure shoppers. Price reductions ranging 20% to 50% have been common 
during the season. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to boost sales of big-ticket items, Sears, Roebuck and Co. offered 
0% financing starting Thursday on appliances, furniture, home electronics and 
carpeting costing more than $200. J. C. Penney is starting its traditional 
"after-Christmas sale" on Saturday, three days before the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Problem is, sales eat into profits. A price-cutting binge may offset the surge 
in volume derived from a last-minute shopping stampede. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if they can bring customers in the door, the fact is that discounting 
hurts earnings," said Sandra Shaber, an economist and management consultant for 
The Futures Group in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Stack, an analyst for the stock brokerage Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards 
in Los Angeles, adds that no matter how busy the three days turn out to be, it 
will be hard to recoup from five flat weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Many retailers agree. Said one San Diego sporting goods store manager: "I don't 
think this weekend will save the season; I'm just hoping to break even." 
</P>
<P>
Department store executives say they have seen a trend for years toward 
shopping later in the season, particularly as consumers become more bargain 
hungry and have less time to shop. 
</P>
<P>
But one thing that retailers could never plan on was the onslaught of cold, 
wintry weather that has gripped the Southland the past few days. Finally, it's 
beginning to look a lot like Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Chick, president of the Covina-based Chick's Sporting Good chain of six 
stores, said the weather should help heat up icy sales of winter and ski gear. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers who wait too long, however, may pay an unexpected price for their 
procrastination. Some key items may be sold out by Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Although overall retailing has been off, there have been some regional bright 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
Some San Diego retailers, for instance, are hoping that the return of the 
aircraft carrier Independence from duty off the Persian Gulf will flood the 
city with free-spending sailors.

CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY FILED BY JIMSAIR AVIATION 
</P>

<P>
Jimsair Aviation Services, a San Diego aircraft fueling and service company 
with operations at San Diego's Lindbergh Field and in Palm Springs, has filed 
for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
President Phil Bracamonte said the company's high debt -- taken on to finance 
expansion -- coupled with a downturn in business forced it to seek protection 
from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no disruption of services and no layoffs of the company's 65 
employees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Bracamonte said the company has $8.9 million in assets and 
$8.4 million in liabilities. Among the assets is a lease for hangar space 
through the year 2014 with the San Diego Unified Port District, operator of 
Lindbergh Field. 
</P>
<P>
The company recently spent a considerable sum doubling its hangar space at 
Lindbergh, but Bracamonte said problems with the Palm Springs facility were 
more to blame for the financial difficulties that led to the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
The company's major creditors include Textron, First National Bank of San Diego 
and BP Oil, the firm's attorney Peter L. Duncan said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Jimsair filed its bankruptcy petition in the court of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge 
James W. Meyers. The company was founded in 1952, when it established a 
presence at Lindbergh, Bracamonte said. 
</P>
<P>
A sale of the company to Flightcraft of Portland, Ore. was announced last year 
but fell through. CHRIS KRAUL

BEHIND THE WHEEL / TOYOTA TERCEL DX: A REAL-LIFE CAR TO MEET YOUR NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The median price of a new car recently rose to $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
In real life, that buys a half-share in a Lincoln Town Car, will put you into a 
12-year-old Porsche or just about cover the sales tax on a Bentley Turbo. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, today's new car buyers should not consider $15K as an 
inescapable sentence to search weekend classifieds for a Cal Worrisome special 
among former Hertz fleet rentals. 
</P>
<P>
For there is indeed life below $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
They are called subcompacts. 
</P>
<P>
There's the Ford Escort and the Mazda Protege, small yet solid performers 
sharing a nicely tuned Asian chassis and base pricing below $9,000. Next, the 
Honda Civic, a peppy veteran of this pintpot platoon and the $7,000 starter of 
a Honda-Acura line that in recent years can do no wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The Geo Prizm is Chevrolet's $10,000 clone of Toyota's subcompact Corolla at 
about the same price. Geo out of Toyota means doors and lids that fit tightly, 
a superior finish to paints and plastics, outstanding value all around -- and 
consciences salved by the double standard of owning a Japanese car while still 
buying American. 
</P>
<P>
This is a "carry-over year" for Escort, Protege, Civic, Prizm and Corolla. Trim 
packages have been changed and a few options added. Transmissions have been 
revised and wagons introduced. But there will be no major revisions of engines 
and other serious mechanicals for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
For three other models in the subcompact set, however, 1991 marks the birth of 
new generations. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota has enlarged the entry-level Tercel and increased the horsepower. Nissan 
has installed a new, twin-cam, 16-valve engine in the Sentra that opens its 
line. 
</P>
<P>
And Mitsubishi has added 11 more horsepower to its little Mirage -- another 
captive of the rebadging frenzy and sold as the Colt through Dodge-Plymouth 
dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks ahead, we will evaluate all the new subcompacts that -- despite 
the buying public's apparent predilection for performance, matched hides and 
European grandeur -- remain the meat and potatoes of our motoring habit. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the purchase of any vehicle for $15,000 or less is no longer the 
cramped, noisy, vibrating, dawdling and sloppy handling compromise it used to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the motorized perambulators that used 30 miles of the Hollywood 
Freeway to reach the fast lane. No more the mechanical Cubism where routine 
maintenance included realignment of front wheels and the driver's spine. 
</P>
<P>
Today's automotive technology has advanced to where subcompacts come 
inexpensive, but not cheap. They look small but feel large. They give more than 
30-m.p.g. on highways and they can easily travel at 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
And the Toyota Tercel is typical. 
</P>
<P>
Wheelbase and length are the same as the 1987 design it replaces -- but the 
interior is roomier by 9%. 
</P>
<P>
The car has been lightened to less than one ton and its carburetor has been 
replaced by fuel injection. That combination is good for a 5% improvement in 
horsepower (to 82 h.p.) and slightly quicker acceleration times. 
</P>
<P>
Trunk space is up to 10.7 cubic feet (a 7% increase), which is more room than 
you will find in a Ford Mustang. There's greater headroom, front and rear, than 
the Acura Integra and more rear leg room than the BMW 325. 
</P>
<P>
The Tercel is offered as a four-door this year, and Toyota claims the car can 
carry five passengers. It does not specify five adults, five children, five 
schnauzers, or one large driver and four orders of Thai takeout. Ergo, we would 
not recommend five of anything for journeys much longer than the average 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
Another hard truth of the Tercel -- or any subcompact -- should not be 
overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
It does not have the power and performance of a Ford Mustang. It cannot offer 
the up-market richness of the Acura Integra. Unless you are into humiliation 
(or have a backup Porsche), do not go against a BMW on Mulholland. 
</P>
<P>
If you are looking for motoring's little luxuries, it is respectfully suggested 
you look elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
But by all means expect this subcompact to offer competent performance, safe 
and satisfactory handling and a simple but not unpleasing interior. 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, you will be paying only $6,488 (for a two-door Tercel with a 
4-speed manual transmission, the upper limit of Spartanism) for a car of 
established durability. And with a gas tank holding 12 gallons, you're also 
good for about one weekly trip to the pumps. 
</P>
<P>
In balance, cars like the Tercel fulfill all our motoring needs without 
indulging our wants. 
</P>
<P>
In truth -- especially when those needs are no greater than daily travels on 
constipated freeways -- what else does a Mercedes offer beyond more elegant 
lolling room? 
</P>
<P>
The styling of the Tercel seems to have taken a cue from Toyota's Previa van. 
It is well-rounded, somewhat domed, and in brown or green might be mistaken for 
a desert tortoise. 
</P>
<P>
The high notchback (the area that used to be known as the rear deck) is more of 
a cleft, creating a squat rear that is about the only legacy from ghosts of 
subcompacts past. Except for cursed plastic wheel covers (we did some 
curb-polishing on two in the first 60 miles of city driving) on the Deluxe 
Sedan. It remains a major mystery of our time why manufacturers continue to see 
these scuffed Frisbees as an improvement on even the steel wheels of bargain 
basement models. 
</P>
<P>
But the fat, wraparound body moldings and body-color front grille add dashes of 
the '90s and upscale style to the Deluxe Tercel. It also was satisfying to see 
narrowed body seams that tame the car's slipstream and reduce wind noise to the 
interior. 
</P>
<P>
That interior is practical, functional, unobtrusive, definitely uninspiring and 
clearly assembled by designers who know that inexpensive elaborations on basic 
equipment is an open invitation to tackiness. 
</P>
<P>
Our Blue Metallic test vehicle came with power steering that clearly is a $250 
extravagance. With a curb weight of 1,975 pounds, the car is light enough. With 
power steering added to a suspension softened more for commuting than 
cavorting, the handling gives a sense of float. 
</P>
<P>
Even in this relatively low-powered front-driver, knowing exactly what the 
front wheels are doing -- particularly in the wet and winter slipperies -- 
falls squarely beneath the heading of critical information. Power steering was 
developed to provide assistance, not anesthetize. 
</P>
<P>
On the road, the Tercel is highly maneuverable. The acceleration won't bring 
tears to your eyes, especially with the automatic. But the pace is adequate, 
albeit directly reflective of a driver's skill with the five-speed manual. 
</P>
<P>
Brakes: Discs up front and more than enough. 
</P>
<P>
Speed: Sufficient to surprise those who thought they had their minds made up 
about feeble subcompacts. 
</P>
<P>
Comfort: To compact car standards. 
</P>
<P>
Engines in the smaller sedans of yore, were traditionally noisy little things 
rattling on basic mounts until the inside of the car felt rather like a working 
beehive. 
</P>
<P>
In the new Tercel, the crankshaft has been rebalanced and weighted to reduce 
the thrashing. Fire wall and dash are made from a metal sandwich that contains 
acoustical insulation. So mechanical noises remain and even become intrusive 
when the engine is working hard. But they have been drastically reduced. 
</P>
<P>
No air bags are offered on the Tercel. The best sound system on its option list 
comes with only four speakers. Seat belts are manual. There are no illuminated 
vanity mirrors nor power windows nor rear spoiler nor climate control . . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's also also missing a $15,000 window sticker.

As the Year Turns: The Millennium Society, the group planning the big New 
Year's Eve party for Dec. 31, 1999, at the Great Pyramid in Egypt and 23 other 
sites around the world, has announced its "Most Inspiring" list of the year, 
including Czechoslovakian President Vaclav Havel, singer-composer Paul 
McCartney, the Aga Khan, basketball star Michael Jordan, actor Kevin Costner 
and Bart Simpson.

Family Outing: The Bushes were out and about Wednesday. President Bush had five 
grandchildren in tow at a public screening of "The Blue Planet," the latest 
massive-screen film at the Air &amp; Space Museum in Washington. Meanwhile 
First Lady Barbara Bush took in a private tour of the National Gallery's Titian 
exhibit.

Out in the Cold: Dorothy Heyser, the 64-year-old wealthy Dallas socialite who 
was John Tower's longtime companion, was married for the fourth time Wednesday 
and the groom wasn't Tower. Heyser married Robert Goddard, a wealthy Texas 
businessman. Heyser was the supportive presence at the former senator's side 
during the Senate hearings on his failed nomination for secretary of defense. 
The Washington Post's Chuck Conconi quotes a Tower friend as saying Tower was 
not just surprised; Tower's reaction was more like "shock."

As I read about the researchers who are looking for ways to extend our life 
spans and of the people egging them on, I truly wonder if we humans have not 
lost all reason. 
</P>
<P>
In my own lifetime, the world's population has risen from 2 billion to more 
than 5 billion, and demographers are projecting 10 to 12 billion total in the 
next 50 years -- in the lifetimes of my children and grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Species are going extinct every day because we humans are polluting and 
crowding them to death. Can't we oldsters graciously exit so the next 
generation can have its turn? Better yet, can't researchers bend their energies 
to figuring out how to keep human fertility in balance with the rest of God's 
creatures?

While I sympathize with the feelings of isolation felt by many Jewish parents 
and teachers at this time of the year ("Parents Wrestle with December's 
Dilemma," Dec. 17), I must remind them that one of the themes of Hanukkah and 
other Jewish holidays is tolerance of different beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of making calls of complaint to the Jewish Federation, why isn't that 
parent making latkes, playing dreidel and teaching her child's class about 
Hanukkah? 
</P>
<P>
I have never felt guilty or wanted my children to feel guilty about enjoying 
the holidays of other religions. The more we know about the beliefs of others, 
the more we understand each other.

A POINTILLIST NOVEL BEST SEEN FROM A DISTANCE;

Trailing clouds of continental glory, a French success warmly welcomed in 
England, "Women" may be the first pointillist post-feminist novel. Eschewing 
complete sentences as a dreary bourgeois convention, Philippe Sollers uses 
triple dots as the all-purpose punctuation mark. At an average of, let's say, 
125 per page, that idiosyncrasy adds up to approximately 80,000 for a book of 
this length. 
</P>
<P>
Dots . . . Of course, Seurat used dots to create spectacular neo-impressionist 
paintings, so there is a definite precedent for this artistic experiment. 
Writers have been slow to follow suit, perhaps because the technique requires 
that the work be viewed at a distance of at least 10 feet -- easy enough when 
one is looking at a painting, considerably more demanding when reading a book. 
Perused from a mere foot away, even a masterpiece like "Sunday Afternoon on La 
Grande Jatte" turns into confetti. 
</P>
<P>
Read in the usual way, "Women" splinters into frank pornography. Considered in 
perspective, it's easily the most ferociously misogynist tract since John 
Knox's "First Blasts of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women" in 
1558. Unlike Knox, who was merely inveighing against Mary Queen of Scots, 
Sollers is attacking the entire sex. Arrogant, emotionally frigid and 
pathologically self-indulgent, the narrator continually marvels at his own 
sexual prowess and its magical effect upon the women he treats with such 
contempt, loathing his conquests for adoring him. 
</P>
<P>
The protagonist of this first-person diatribe is Will, an expatriate American 
journalist living and working in France. His sexual odyssey takes him all over 
the world . . . a paranoid Priapus compulsively jetting to his own destruction. 
</P>
<P>
When the hejira begins, Will has already decided that female sexuality is 
synonymous with death, a hypothesis he continually tests by fornication, each 
experiment reinforcing his pre-existing theory. The record will eventually form 
a novel to be called "Women," though the fieldwork consumes so much of his 
energy that there's little left for the actual writing. (What we have here may 
be the notes.) The subjects represent all nationalities, ethnic strains and 
cultures, the list constantly expanding. By page 157, we've seen him in action 
with Cyd, Lynn, Flora, Ysia, Jane, Helen, Dora, and Barbara . . . a veritable 
U.N. of women alone and in combination, though we haven't yet met his wife, the 
learned and loyal Deborah, mother of Will's son Stephen. "How crazy not just to 
stay quietly at home with them . . . Not to just accept that particular death . 
. . The only one with any useful meaning" . . . A fleeting thought, and he's 
off again, verifying his foregone conclusions. Fortunately, the possibilities 
are finite. 
</P>
<P>
Women as vampires, women as zombies, women as piranhas, women as torturers, 
women as cannibals . . . but most of all, women as sexually insatiable 
death-dealing castraters . . . "You're surrounded by the living dead . . . 
They're swimming toward you . . . They're half-rotten jaws hem you in . . . 
Throwing their grappling hooks . . . Clambering up toward the light they dimly 
discern in their musty, dark-encumbered minds . . . you are Moby Dick . . . The 
White Whale . . . They'll hunt you through the whole world . . . To harpoon you 
. . . Cut you up . . . Eat you in slices . . ." And so on and on; women as 
"givers of death, not life," women united in a terrorist organization called 
the World Organization for Male Annihilation and a New Natality (WOMANN), 
dedicated to the overthrow of the Judeo-Christian tradition and the reduction 
of men to mere sperm factories . . . And that's just for openers. 
</P>
<P>
Heavily larded with literary allusions and showy demonstrations of the author's 
familiarity with the works of Picasso, de Kooning, the Bible, Barthes, 
Foucault, Mao, Flaubert, Melville, Freud, Tolstoy, Mozart, Bach, the Marquis de 
Sade, as well as a gaggle of contemporary European intellectuals and Eastern 
gurus, "Women" stridently demands to be taken seriously as a nihilistic satire 
on philosophy, religion, the arts, social science, America, France, and 
whatever else swims into view. While some of these riffs are wildly inventive, 
most are mere invocations of magic names, summoned to gild the eroticism and 
supply the requisite redeeming social value. Think of Sollers as a latter-day 
Glendower, loudly calling spirits from the vasty deep, lacking only Hotspur to 
remind him: "Why so can I, or so can any man; But will they come when you do 
call for them?" In Europe, they came running. Let's see what happens here.

Basket Case 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hanks, Steve Bochco, John Candy, Don Henley and Michael Keaton are all 
giving the same holiday present this year -- gift baskets. Tinseltowners are 
flocking to Marmalade, the 5-week-old shop in Santa Monica that assembles 
custom-tailored baskets for an average price of $100. Shoppers also can order 
intricately designed tins or brocade stockings filled with everything from 
chutney, jam and tea to pate, cheese, creole sauces and breads and more. 
Porcelain fish, farm animals (all sizes), and carved dolls produced by cottage 
industries can be added, for a price. 
</P>
<P>
DO THEY GIFT WRAP? Last week, Heather Locklear took advantage of the promise of 
delivery before Christmas at Kreiss Collection in West Hollywood. She chose 
custom furniture right off the floor, to fill every room in the nest she shares 
with hubby, Tommy Lee of Motley Crue fame. 
</P>

WHAT A CARD: What's gold-colored plastic, fits in your wallet and gets flashed 
a lot in Beverly Hills? The recently issued city gold card, of course. But 
don't expect it to get you very far at Gucci. It's a bar-coded library card 
used in the new automated book checkout system. In an amusing bit of reverse 
snobbery, the children's cards are platinum. 
</P>
<P>
HOW GOOD IS YOUR CREDIT? Looking for something sparkly to put under the 
Christmas tree? Considered a tiara? There are very few available in the world, 
but one is at Fred in Beverly Hills. Sure, it's pricey at $2,205,000 but it has 
a 137-carat emerald centerpiece and comes with a matching necklace that boasts 
50 carats of diamonds. At the more affordable end of the wish list, Listen has 
also noticed the hottest rings of the season, which double as watches, sell for 
a mere $23. The tiny timepieces by Digits are modeled after some famous status 
watches by Cartier, Rolex and the like. Hecht's in Washington, D.C., held the 
record for sales, 500 in one day, until Robinson's put them on the shelves in 
their Los Angeles-area stores. Two thousand were snatched up in a day and a 
half. 
</P>
<P>
PHOTO OP: When baby Paulina, daughter of Wayne Gretzky and Janet Jones, got her 
first haircut she was taken to Cowlicks, the Calabasas children's hair salon 
where the management videotapes the event. Salon spokeswoman Jane Baker says 
some children are so taken with their snip scenes they bring their tapes back 
time and again to record their entire haircut history. The price for a shampoo, 
cut, blow dry and video documentation is $19 for girls, $17 for boys. 
</P>
<P>
COMPETITIVE EDGE: There is a new kind of golf wear on the market designed to 
improve your game via sports psychology. The design of the clothing uses color 
and graphic motifs to reinforce attitudes that have been identified with 
improving performance. One shirt, in a soft purple with a geometric pattern, is 
to remind a player to stay focused. A red and black shirt with angular graphics 
stimulates aggressiveness. The psych-out shirts, called Mindset, will be 
available in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
WHEREFORE ART THOU: Romeo Gigli's New York "image director," Ellen Carey, was 
at I. Magnin over the weekend for the opening of Magnin's new Gigli boutique. 
She had a few choice observations about East Coast versus West Coast style. 
"They wear more color here," she noted, explaining that Magnin stocked up on 
marigold-color Gigli outfits while the free-standing Gigli boutique in New York 
carries more subtle shades of eggplant. And, of course, "People in L.A. are 
much more body-conscious. They wear all-Lycra Gigli outfits. In New York they'd 
cover Lycra leggings with a long, silk top."

Hollywood Memorabilia Sells: The Jewish marriage certificate of Marilyn Monroe 
and Arthur Miller was sold Thursday in London for $13,700, Christie's 
auctioneers said. The ketubah, a framed marriage certificate with a decorated 
border in the style of a medieval manuscript, was sold by the executors of 
Monroe's estate and bought by an unidentified American. Indiana Jones' kangaroo 
hide bullwhip sold for $24,300 -- more than double its estimate -- to the owner 
of Paris' City Rock Cafe. CLAUDIA PUIG

Vanilla Ice's "To the Extreme" is one of the fastest-selling albums in many 
years. Though out less about four months, it's already sold more than 5 million 
units and is still going strong. 
</P>
<P>
For the last eight weeks, it's been the No. 1 album on the Billboard magazine 
pop chart. M.C. Hammer's "Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'em" -- a fixture at No.2 
after months on top -- is still a big seller, but it's just not selling at the 
phenomenal rate of Ice. The Simpsons' album, "The Simpsons Sing the Blues," is 
the hot newcomer, barreling up to No. 10 in just two weeks. Madonna's "Justify 
My Love" moved up to No. 1 on the pop singles chart. 
</P>
<P>
* This album of remixed versions of New Kids' hits is shooting up the chart, 
jumping from No. 30 to No. 19. It won't be as popular as the group's Christmas 
album last year, but it may make the Top 10.

Hammer Tops 'Em: Rap artist M.C. Hammer, the "dancing machine" from Oakland, 
received seven nominations Thursday for the 18th annual American Music Awards, 
the most of any recording artist. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer has brought rap into the mainstream with his album "Please Hammer, Don't 
Hurt 'Em" topping the charts as the best-selling album this year, with more 
than 8 million records sold. Hammer's nominations came in three categories: 
pop-rock, rap and soul-rhythm and blues. Janet Jackson was second in 
nominations with five. Madonna received four nominations. The awards will be 
presented Jan. 28 on ABC. CLAUDIA PUIG

ROFFE'S HOPES HINGE ON DAMAGE TO KNEE

<P>
Diann Roffe, America's leading ski racer, will be examined today by Dr. Richard 
Steadman in Vail, Colo., to determine the extent of damage to her left knee, 
which she injured Wednesday in a downhill training spill at Morzine, France. 
</P>
<P>
One of Roffe's teammates, Kristin Krone, was quoted by the Associated Press as 
saying: "The doctor (in France) examined her, and there is a problem with the 
ligaments of the left knee but he doesn't know how serious. According to the 
doctor, Diann could miss about three weeks or (up to) six months." 
</P>
<P>
If the diagnosis results in a three-week absence, Roffe, 23, of Isle La Motte, 
Vt., will miss only the World Cup downhill, slalom and combined events at 
Morzine today and Saturday, and probably the first two races when the circuit 
resumes on Jan. 6-7. Six months, of course, would sideline her for the rest of 
the season, including the World Alpine Ski Championships at Saalbach, Austria, 
Jan. 21-Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the 1985 World Championships at Bormio, Italy, that the then 
17-year-old Roffe surprised everyone by winning the gold medal in the giant 
slalom. 
</P>
<P>
There followed a string of injuries that resulted in four operations -- two on 
each knee. Last season, she appeared to have regained her form and finished 
10th in the World Cup women's overall standings with 130 points. After five 
races this season, she is in fourth place with 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. women's team is already competing this winter without Kristi Terzian, 
who suffered a serious knee injury in October, after scoring points in 17 World 
Cup races last season. 
</P>
<P>
Petra Kronberger of Austria continues to dominate the World Cup women with 115 
points, followed by teammate Sigrid Wolf with 45 and Germany's Katrin Gutensohn 
with 34. 
</P>
<P>
Italian hero Alberto Tomba hopes to regain the men's lead in a slalom and giant 
slalom today and Saturday at Kranjska Gora, Yugoslavia. He has 72 points, four 
fewer than Franz Heinzer of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Ole Christian Furuseth, who won last Tuesday's slalom on Tomba's home slopes at 
Madonna di Campiglio, is third with 63, followed by fellow Norwegian Atle 
Skaardal with 52 and three-time World Cup overall champion Marc Girardelli of 
Luxembourg with 51. 
</P>
<P>
A.J. Kitt, 22, of Rochester, N.Y., is the top American in 44th place. He has 
eight points after finishing 15th and then ninth in a pair of downhills last 
weekend at Val Gardena, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Snow fell on California this week, just in time to improve conditions for the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
In the Southland, Big Bear was blanketed with four to six inches of powder -- 
meaning that Snow Valley, Snow Summit and Bear Mountain have depths of 12 to 36 
inches of natural and man-made snow -- and Mountain High, near Wrightwood, 
added an inch or so, giving it similar coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The High Sierra, which had been skimping along, is now in relatively good shape 
after the cold storm dumped eight to 28 inches on resorts from Mammoth Mountain 
to Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
Mammoth reported 12 inches of new snow, boosting its total to 30 inches at the 
top of the mountain. Warming Hut II will be warmed up this weekend for skiing 
off chairlifts 17 and 7, with No. 16 operating mainly for access to other runs. 
In all, 10-12 lifts will be running. 
</P>
<P>
High winds forced Mammoth to shut down Wednesday, but the Eastern Sierra resort 
was open again Thursday, as was nearby June Mountain, which offered skiers a 
24-inch base for the first day of its season. 
</P>
<P>
On the Western slope, Mt. Reba at Bear Valley also opened Thursday, making it 
just about unanimous in Central and Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Skiing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Pro Tour will take the next two weekends off before resuming action 
Jan. 4-6, the men at Heavenly Valley and the women at Bromley Mountain, Vt. 
Phil Mahre of Yakima, Wash., won his first race of the season when he defeated 
Roland Pfeifer of Austria in the slalom final last Sunday at Nashoba Valley, 
Mass., after beating twin brother Steve Mahre in the round of 16. Bernhard 
Knauss of Austria hooked a ski tip in both heats of his round-of-16 race but 
still leads the men's standings with 155 points, 60 more than Tomaz Cerkovnik 
of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Big Bear Express, the new high-speed detachable quad chairlift at Bear 
Mountain, opens Saturday. . . . Breckenridge, Colo., dedicates its fourth quad 
chairlift Sunday with Mercury astronauts Alan Shepard, John Glenn, Gordon 
Cooper and Scott Carpenter participating in the ceremonies. The $5-million lift 
serving Beaver Run has been named the Mercury SuperChair. 
</P>
<P>
"Warren Miller's Extreme Skiing," produced by Warren Miller of Hermosa Beach, 
won "Best of Festival" honors at the Ray-Ban International Ski Film Festival in 
Crested Butte, Colo. . . . ESPN will show highlights of the recent 24 Hours of 
Aspen ski marathon at Aspen, Colo., today at 5 p.m., PST, following "Subaru Ski 
World With Bob Beattie" at 4:30.

DANA HILLS MISSES GAME AFTER MIX-UP, FACES COIN FLIP TODAY

Dana Hills and San Clemente high schools will have a coin flip to decide which 
team advances in the San Dieguito boys' basketball tournament after the teams 
did not play their scheduled game Thursday because of a scheduling mix-up. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, we are going to have a coin flip (today)," tournament director 
David LaBorde said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to try to play the game (today) but couldn't get the 
arrangements made." 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins were to play San Clemente at 7:30 p.m. Thursday at Carlsbad High 
School, but tipoff time was changed to 5:30 because of construction scheduled 
for the gymnasium. San Clemente was notified, but Dana Hills Coach Rich Skelton 
said he was not, and the Dana Hills team arrived at 6:30 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
The game, however, had been officially ruled a forfeit at 6:15. 
</P>
<P>
LaBorde reversed the decision, allowing the game to be rescheduled, pending 
arrangements. But those arrangements could not be made. ARA NAJARIAN

KITSCHY, KITSCHY GOO

With a crash, some flash and a chorus of "goos" and "aaaahs," "Kindergarten 
Cop" (citywide), unveils the new kinder, gentler Arnold Schwarzenegger: 
would-be super-hunk for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
But, even from this movie's new tot's-eye perspective, it's the same old Arnie 
game. The Austrian inflections and minimalist acting strategies haven't 
changed. Neither have the affable, bemused stares, the softly maniacal relish 
at destroying bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
There is something different: the context. Befitting the morning-after '90s, 
Schwarzenegger is now a robo-cop with a heart, a tweetie-pie terminator, Dirty 
Hansel with a pocketful of Gummi bears. He's Sudden Death elfinized: with 
dozens of adorable kiddies dangling from every visible pectoral, gun-grip and 
bicep. 
</P>
<P>
As image makeover and sheer crass commercial calculation, "Kindergarten Cop" is 
a dubious triumph. You have to give it credit: In a way, it's the ultimate 
marketing-hook movie, a kind of pop-commercial bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
The director, Ivan Reitman, and the writers have streamlined their work with 
such single-minded professionalism that their storytelling becomes the 
cinematic equivalent of a foot in the door, a show that's all sell, hype 
transmogrified. Watching the trailer probably made audiences want to see the 
movie, and watching the movie may make them want to see the trailer. Actually, 
I'm not sure which is the purer or more effective version of the story: maybe 
it achieves its perfect aesthetic form in the 15-second TV spots. 
</P>
<P>
"Cop" begins with what plays like a 20-minute parody of most of the 
Schwarzenegger super-action specials of the '80s -- with the star's defiantly 
slovenly and cheerfully sadistic undercover cop, John Kimble, stalking a drug 
kingpin through a shopping mall, and pursuing a junkie witness to a Skid Row 
dive, which he proceeds to blast apart with what looks like a sawed-off 
howitzer. 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, in his 12 o'clock shadow and great floppy overcoat, sometimes looks 
like a flasher. His nemesis Crisp, by contrast, is a cold-blooded, nasty-natty 
mama's boy with a ponytail (Richard Tyson), enraged because his ex-wife and boy 
have disappeared. In order to trap him, Kimble and his female partner, Phoebe 
(played by that husky-voiced, scene-stealing wonder, Pamela Reed) have to stake 
out mother and child in Seattle. There, Phoebe will pretend to be the boy's 
kindergarten teacher: a job that a series of contrived gastronomic and medical 
mishaps promptly switches over to Kimble. 
</P>
<P>
The movie's main under-theme is that the killer has what Kimble deserves: the 
wife and child that are life's ultimate reward. Kimble, stoic dirty-job man, 
has been fleeing domesticity; crazy Crisp wallows in it with his equally 
sadistic mom (Carroll Baker). The movie becomes a race to see who ultimately 
finds and wins the prize. 
</P>
<P>
But, even more than this wisp of a fish-out-of-water hook, the film's strategy 
lies in its gentling of Schwarzenegger. It's as if that first shot of slob 
Kimble were a before-and-after set-up. "Cop" wants to turn him into someone who 
belongs in a shopping mall. And it does: surrounding him with maternal or 
sisterly substitutes throughout: most obviously food-freak Phoebe and Linda 
Hunt as the school's taskmaster principal. 
</P>
<P>
The filmmakers play Kimble's initial fascist tactics for laughs and then they 
suggest (consciously?) that he's a better teacher, because he is a bit of a 
fascist: because he takes this anarchic classroom and whips them into 
drill-team shape, because he can beat up abusive parents. 
</P>
<P>
Reitman uses the child actors well, but they're not as important as the title 
and the trailers suggest, and some of their lines -- like the deadpan gags 
about sexual organs -- are cheap and exploitative. In the end, nothing gets in 
the way of this movie's self-salesmanship: mapped out and executed with 
political campaign slickness. "Kindie-Cop" doesn't have plot twists; it has 
testimonials and endorsements -- or, rather, it has plot twists that turn into 
testimonials, that exist mainly to show what a swell guy Kimble-Schwarzenegger 
is becoming. 
</P>
<P>
It would be lying not to say that some of the moviemakers here, Reitman and his 
editors especially, aren't working at the top of their craft, or that the movie 
won't reach audiences. On its own terms, "Kindergarten Cop" (rated PG-13, 
despite violence, sex and language) is nearly fool-proof: the last word in 
glib, shallow, soulless, spuriously warm-hearted commercialism. In one scene, 
it surpasses itself: Kimble's class, in matching Abraham Lincoln beards and 
outfits, recites the Gettysburg address, Kimble gets a standing ovation, and 
Reitman and company scrape the dizzy heights. They've taken us very near the 
apotheosis of shameless kitsch.

DE PALMA DAMPS THE 'BONFIRE'; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: A RICH NOVEL IS TURNED INTO AN OVERSTATED, CARTOONED FILM FOR DULLARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian De Palma opens his calamitous version of Tom Wolfe's dense novel "The 
Bonfire of the Vanities" (at selected theaters) with a glittering, 
dusk-through-dawn shot of Manhattan from a point of view of a Chrysler Building 
gargoyle. 
</P>
<P>
It's not the last of the movie's visual excitement; unfortunately, it's not the 
last of its monsters either. In a disastrous misjudgment, De Palma decided that 
Wolfe's panoramic morality play about a privileged WASP overreacher needed 
pointing up for dullards like us in a movie audience. 
</P>
<P>
So what was rich, journalistic and precisely observed is now overstated, 
under-textured and cartooned, in playwright/screenwriter Michael Cristofer's 
witless screenplay. Certainly Wolfe's canvas might lend itself to a broad 
approach, but broad like "Dr. Strangelove," not broad like the Three Stooges. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the three principals -- a game but miscast Tom Hanks as 
the patrician broker Sherman McCoy, Melanie Griffith as his mistress, Maria 
Ruskin, and Bruce Willis as the boozy journalist responsible for Sherman's 
plummet from power -- De Palma has packed the screen wall-to-wall with harpies, 
gargoyles, grotesques and caricatures. He's also made Wolfe's memorable Jewish 
judge, Myron Kovitsky, black, the better for Morgan Freeman to deliver the 
movie's stern but soothing homilies to an almost-rioting black courtroom 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
Both De Palma's tamperings and his approach may infuriate those who savored the 
book's brilliant high comedy, while the movie's callow vision of life among the 
haves -- and have-nots -- is enough to make non-"Bonfire" readers wonder why 
anyone would have read 10 pages of anything this sophomoric, much less 659 of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
In rough outline, Hanks' Sherman McCoy feels himself a true Master of the 
Universe, one of those Norse-god-like plastic toys, as he contemplates his 
assets: top-dog position at a hallowed Wall Street brokerage house, a Park 
Avenue apartment and a wife, daughter and mistress. 
</P>
<P>
All will be ripped away from him after a hit-and-run accident in the Bronx, 
when Sherman's Mercedes apparently hits and injures a young black man at a dark 
freeway on-ramp. Conscience-stricken, Sherman wants to report it, but since the 
also-married Maria is a clandestine fellow passenger, she persuades him not to. 
</P>
<P>
When the victim falls into a coma and the car's ownership is traced, Sherman 
becomes the center of a political cat's cradle reaching from the Bronx to Wall 
Street to Park Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The Bronx D.A. (F. Murray Abraham) wants Sherman's WASP neck, the better to run 
for mayor. Harlem's self-styled religious leader, Rev. Bacon (John Hancock), 
spokesman for the young victim's mother (Mary Alice), wants Sherman as an 
example of white arrogance. His too-chic and too-thin wife Judy (Kim Cattrall), 
the injured party, wants Sherman's child and his bank account. And Maria wants 
whatever moving part is left over. 
</P>
<P>
While Sherman's term of office as one of Manhattan's Masters was relatively 
short-lived in the novel, it was written with such authority that his patrician 
family, his business savvy and his enormous success had real believability and 
meaning. By introducing Sherman, as De Palma does, just as his foot hits the 
roller skate at the top of the stairs, we have no sense of what he stands to 
lose. Certainly the loss of that wife or that child would come under the 
heading of a blessing. And in spite of Hanks' touch with both the film's comedy 
and pathos, and Sherman's birthright isolation from the real world, Hanks still 
seems too boyishly untried, not world-worn enough. 
</P>
<P>
In much the same vein as Sidney Lumet's insightful "Q&amp;A," Wolfe suggested 
that shaky ethnic alliances had held the city together for generations and that 
they might be fraying out in front of New Yorkers' oblivious noses. The movie 
goes for the fury without the artful distinctions among these warring factions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Wolfe's book was prescient, before Howard Beach, before Tawana 
Brawley, before even the yo-yo-ing fortunes of The Donald. When Wolfe drew a 
character like Rev. Bacon and his theory of ghetto "steam control," Bacon was a 
rich and complex key to the city's ferment. 
</P>
<P>
Now however, Bacon is simply an easy send-up of Al Sharpton, never seen without 
his back-up gospel chorus of five women in gold satin robes. He's been 
transformed the same way that Peter Fallow, the book's dim alcoholic English 
tabloid hack, has been turned into the wryly American Bruce Willis -- by taking 
all the good stuff out. And so it goes, character by character, throughout the 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
Willis, for the relatively little that's demanded of him in terms of 
characterization, is very good. If you think his amazing physical business at 
the opening is easy, think again. Griffith, who's able to capture every nuance 
of Maria's devious mind and every inch of her stunning body, is equally fine. 
(The film's R rating is for strong language.) In contrast, most of the rest of 
the cast has been cattle-prodded into wretched excess, beginning with Abraham 
and Cattrall. 
</P>
<P>
De Palma has pushed the look of his movie into cartoony excess too, so that we 
are forever peering at characters from the jowls up or from the bald spot down 
or as they are goggling into the camera like TV pitchman Ernest. 
</P>
<P>
This can hardly be laid at the door of the splendid cameraman Vilmos Zsigmond, 
who is just giving the boss what he wants. To be fair, De Palma also wanted the 
amazing five-minute opening action sequence that introduces Willis' Peter 
Fallow, arriving dead drunk for his awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
As Fallow is poured out of a limo, through the entrails of the World Trade 
Center, out of his jacket, into his tuxedo and up on to the awards dinner 
platform, he is caught in a tour-de-force of Steadicam sinuousness that may 
one-up a similarly fluid sequence in "GoodFellas." 
</P>
<P>
In the "GoodFellas" sequence, director Martin Scorsese used one long, 
uninterrupted shot, winding through a nightclub's backstage off-limits to show 
us his young gangster's comic worldliness; it was the character showing off, 
not the director. "Bonfire's" opening sequence is drop-dead but gratuitous, a 
hint of what is to come.

JOFFREY OFFERS 'NUTCRACKER' AT THE PAVILION; 
</P>
<P>
DANCE: GERALD ARPINO AND COMPANY ARE BACK IN BUSINESS AFTER A POWER STRUGGLE 
OVER ARTISTIC CONTROL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the board of American Ballet Theatre recently threatening to disband the 
company during contract negotiations with the dancers, and with some board 
members of the Joffrey Ballet trying unsuccessfully last May to wrest artistic 
control from company co-founder Gerald Arpino, 1990 has been a cruel year in 
the dance world. 
</P>
<P>
So when Arpino took a moment to tell the audience prior to the opening of the 
"Nutcracker," Wednesday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, that it was 
"wonderful to be back," he had earned the moment in the spotlight, even if he 
could not resist adding a remark promoting the spring season. The company could 
use the support. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, it was Joffrey "Nutcracker" business as usual -- welcome business as 
usual -- with all but one familiar face in this 1987 production that offers an 
exemplarily warm first scene and a number of problems later. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Joffrey set the action in America in the 1850s and lived to see the 
premiere. But failing health had required his delegating assignments. (He died 
in 1988.) George Verdak and Scott Barnard shared the staging, drawing on the 
1940 Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo abridgement. Arpino created new choreography 
for the Waltzes of the Snowflakes and Flowers. 
</P>
<P>
In this version, Drosselmeyer, who usually disappears after Act I, stays on to 
stage manage Act II. 
</P>
<P>
Making his first Southern California appearance as Drosselmeyer, Glen Harris 
modeled himself uncannily upon the veteran character dancer Alexander Grant, 
who as a guest originated the role. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who joined the company in 1988, showed youthful ardor and an edge of 
poetry, and danced with clean precision. Lacking Grant's authority, he tended 
to fade out in the intrusive manipulations of the second act, but some of us 
were grateful for that. 
</P>
<P>
Tina LeBlanc and Tom Mossbrucker made an oddly paired Sugar Plum Fairy and 
cavalier-Nutcracker Prince. LeBlanc capitalized upon strong technique, vibrant 
characterization and intelligent phrasing. Mossbrucker was a lyric, dreamy 
Prince and had some problems in finishing cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Barton still looked convincing as an easily hurt but often wonder-struck 
Clara. (She created the role.) As her brother Fritz, Carl Corry could not 
overcome the disadvantage of height and age to blend in with the children. He 
danced Snow Prince and Tea with cautious, correct virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Dawn and Douglas Martin (Snow Queen and Snow King, also Clara's 
parents) demonstrated strong partnership, with Dawn allowing herself real risk 
when taking the flying turns and jumps into his arms. Like LeBlanc, Dawn can 
balance forever and also modulate her phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
Among the mechanical dolls and divertissement dancers, Beatriz Rodriguez made a 
sunny, coyly flirtatious Spanish dancer. Her colleagues proved secure and 
energetic in their assignments. 
</P>
<P>
With conductor Allan Lewis' newly unhectic tempos, Arpino's speed-driven 
choreography for the Waltz of the Snowflakes and, especially, the Flowers could 
bear more scrutiny than usual. The problem, for once, seemed less in the 
choreography than with the corps.

CALDER UNLOADS SOME ZINGERS AT RUTBERG GALLERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An artist sometimes becomes such a household name, you forget why he's good. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Calder, who will forever be known as the guy who invented the mobile, 
also brought a wide-eyed zing to painting and stationary sculpture. An 
exhibition of some of his pieces dating from the 1920s to the '70s (he died in 
1976) reminds us what a disingenuous tinkerer he was -- and how fully he 
absorbed the European Surrealist ethos and Americanized it into a brashly 
lyrical fanfare. A couple of pieces also reestablish Calder's credentials as a 
political commentator. 
</P>
<P>
An exquisitely finished untitled painting from 1945 shows the artist at full 
Surrealist throttle. What appears to be a sprightly imaginary landscape is 
filled with portents of nuclear disaster. 
</P>
<P>
White-hot light illuminates the underside of the cap of a tall mushroom plant 
that softly dissipates into the earth. A striped hourglass form hovers in the 
yellow sky, not far from a phalanx of horizontal, airborne shapes that look 
like escapees from a molecular diagram. A snake -- one of Calder's favorite 
images -- wiggles ominously through the brown earth. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, a cheerful-looking 1969 gouache, "Pennants to the Bird," seems to be 
about the Vietnam War. The "bird" -- which rears up on its hind legs, alongside 
a row of waving red pennants in Calder's inimitable scribble-style -- is surely 
a belligerent American eagle. A dove, symbol of peace, is painted black. 
</P>
<P>
Other works are simply dogged investigations of forms in space. "Hollow Fish," 
from 1929, is a doodle in brass wire -- the sort of thing Calder had been doing 
all his life. (When I interviewed his sister years ago, she unwrapped a group 
of tiny wire animals he made when he was a small child.) A series of irregular 
spirals fills out the body of the fish and hints at its flickering movement; 
the tail is a flat design that incorporates the artist's signature. 
</P>
<P>
There are some mobiles and stables on view, too, though their appeal has become 
somewhat dimmed by the ubiquity of Calder's industrial-sized pieces. Even so, 
some of the small, handmade versions -- like "Duck," a zoomorphic stabile from 
the mid '40s -- still can be appreciated for their delicious economy of means 
and suppleness of wit. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Buzz Word: Aficionados of Los Angeles artist Buzz Spector expect his work to 
yield a delicate combination of humor, erudition, worldly commentary and subtle 
visual pleasures. A group of eight new works by Spector does not disappoint, 
though it contains a couple of one-liners ("Tear" and "Leer") along with more 
meditative pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Half of "French Letters" consists of postcard-sized photographs of the Eiffel 
Tower alternating with photographs of a debonair chap; on the other half, the 
Eiffel Tower alternates with a woman posing by candlelight. 
</P>
<P>
The title of the piece is a reference to the epistolary romance hinted at by 
the photos as well as the English term for condoms: The distance between the 
lovers effectively serves as a prophylactic. The Eiffel Tower, symbol of the 
country synonymous with romance, is an iron framework -- and so is a chastity 
belt. 
</P>
<P>
In the photographs, both of the lovers play with hoary romantic motifs -- 
candlelight, stagy poses -- to create intrigue. But then again, Spector creates 
his own intrigue by juxtaposing the images of two people who probably never met 
and fitting them into a checkerboard pattern suggestive of the games lovers 
play. The piece is a visual jeu d'esprit, offered in the demurely allusive 
terms of the lovers' vanished era. 
</P>
<P>
The activity of collecting is the subject of two pieces. "Re: Collections 
(shells)" consists of a collection of individual shells and a "collector shell" 
(which picks up other shells on its travels), all neatly filed in wooden 
pigeonholes. 
</P>
<P>
The accompanying text describes the collector shell's habits in human terms, as 
if it really feels "the final thrill, the thrill of acquisition." The death 
rattle lurking in those words and the tacit suggestion that seemingly 
sophisticated human habits are no more significant than those of a mollusk 
gives the piece a fine sharp edge. 
</P>
<P>
"Re: Collections (boxes)" is simply a set of old metal-framed glass boxes of 
various sizes, nested inside one another. A metaphor for thought (the way an 
idea leads to a subset of itself), the boxes also suggest the increasingly 
specialized categories devised by the owner of a burgeoning collection, as a 
means of maintaining power over it. These boxes are empty, though; the urge to 
collect is quite independent of the specific objects collectors lust after. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
TV Portraits: Allan McCollum's set of "Perceptual Photos" are blown-up 
photographs of undecipherable shadowy forms. The subjects of these images, 
photographed from a TV screen, are works of art hanging on the walls behind the 
main action in sitcoms and films. McCollum crops out the action and setting 
from the photo, enlarges the work of art to typical painting size and reframes 
it in utilitarian black. 
</P>
<P>
The action of isolating these images calls attention to the dogsbody's role a 
work of art plays in a TV show or film -- as an anonymous symbol of prestige in 
an office or invisibly appropriate furniture for a middle-class home. The 
subject matter isn't important; any traditional landscape or portrait will do. 
Nobody cares who painted it. The point is simply to stock the set with a 
product that registers generically as "art." 
</P>
<P>
"With all of my works, I have always meant to withhold the creation of specific 
meaning," McCollum has written, "because I am so much more interested in the 
quality of meaningfulness in and of itself." 
</P>
<P>
McCollum's point is not to pick nits with the media per se, but to examine in a 
larger sense -- and without overt moralizing -- the role of art as commodity in 
contemporary society. The uniqueness of a work of art is contradicted by the 
interchangeability of all works of art in the popular mind. The specific theme 
of a particular work evaporates under the far more intense identification of 
art with money and power. 
</P>
<P>
Finding the works of art he photographs in the midst of TV dramas is perhaps 
also McCollum's way of drawing attention to the way art is the locus of all 
sorts of human desires -- to communicate an idea, to enjoy oneself, to make a 
good investment, to gain the respect of one's peers. Somehow, we all want to be 
in the picture.

PREMIERES NEEDS TO IRON OUT ITS SCRIPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Premieres sits on the northwest corner of Hollywood and Vine. It's also in the 
heart of Hollywood's theater district, which made my playwright friend Henry 
extremely happy. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally," he said, "a big restaurant right among all the theaters." 
</P>
<P>
Premieres, open just more than six weeks, is big; it seems that there is 
seating for several hundred. But when we walked into the restaurant, the place 
was nearly empty. 
</P>
<P>
The dining room reminded me of a large train station in Europe; there was a 
certain bareness. The walls were pale orange; the furniture was gray. No 
pictures were hung except in the bar. 
</P>
<P>
I was surprised to find the prices high: Appetizers run from $6.50 to $12 each, 
entrees from $14 to $24. But as our waiter told us, we were eating in a 
restaurant with a first-class chef -- Gerard Melou, who came from La Serre in 
Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
"Just wait until this place gets off the ground," Henry rhapsodized. "Can't you 
just see this place filled to capacity with people on their way to see a play . 
. . my play?" 
</P>
<P>
Our waiter recited the evening's specials: "Dinners include a vegetable and 
some form of starch. Oh, and the portions are good. We're not nouvelle here." 
He also advised us to leave room for dessert -- the chef brought his pastry 
chef from La Serre, as well. 
</P>
<P>
When the first courses arrived, I was delighted. The presentation was fetching. 
There was marinated salmon on mixed greens that were fresh and varied. On a 
goat cheese and tomato salad, the cheese had been grated in an unusual and 
appealing pattern. And the waiter was right: Portions were generous. 
</P>
<P>
We dug in and ate in silence for a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe next time I'd get my salmon without the marinade," Henry said. "Or this 
kind of salad dressing." 
</P>
<P>
"At least the ingredients are good," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," said Henry, his voice trailing off. 
</P>
<P>
When the entrees arrived, we cheered up. The plates were downright gorgeous. 
One held walloping big hunks of poached salmon partially elevated by small 
potatoes and arranged in a bright culinary mandala around an artichoke heart 
filled with pretty red chopped vegetables. On the other were two medallions of 
filet mignon in contrasting sauces, united by a thick, free-form line of mashed 
potatoes. "This is as good as some theater right here," Henry said. 
</P>
<P>
Then we ate. Show tunes filled the silence. After a few minutes, we exchanged 
plates. After a few more minutes, we switched back and somewhere in the middle 
of it all, I realized that we were both steadily engaged in the same activity: 
scrupulously scraping the sauce off the meat. 
</P>
<P>
"The chef sure likes peppercorns, doesn't he?" said Henry. 
</P>
<P>
Peppercorns, indeed, were represented to a near overpowering degree in both the 
salmon and the steak sauces. Only the "white" steak sauce was palatable, in 
that it was the least assaultive. Also, both fish and steak, handsome cuts as 
they were, were overcooked. 
</P>
<P>
We had no trouble saving room for dessert. Henry's creme brulee, while 
glassy-topped, had not thickened and closely resembled the pool of creme 
anglaise under my berry tart. Henry's visions of a theater hangout faded. 
</P>
<P>
Since there was much promise in Premieres' cooking, I returned. I was happy to 
discover that the chef doesn't overcook everything, but the sauces still need 
work. A feuilette with wild mushrooms and wildly wonderful large scallops was 
swamped in a dark winey sauce that tasted strongly of something like Marmite. 
The leek coulis that was supposed to accompany the chicken breast at lunch 
turned out to be a thick and overly sweet caramel sauce with some shredded 
leeks in it. The shrimp "Cote d'Azur" consisted of heavenly shrimp in a heavy, 
curiously pungent red sauce. Some great andouille sausage spiked an otherwise 
overly rich cream sauce on the Cajun tagliatelle. 
</P>
<P>
During lunch one day, I overheard a woman talking to her date over the 
feuilette with scallops. "It's pretty good, isn't it?" she said. "I think this 
is a very good restaurant, I eat here a lot." When the waiter came to take her 
order, I couldn't help it, I eavesdropped. I thought that she might know a 
secret thing or two about the menu that I hadn't yet discovered. "I'll have the 
salmon of the day," she said. "And tell the cook, please, no sauce." 
</P>

'RABBIT': IT'S MORE THUD THAN THUMP

<P>
'Tis the season for some folly, the season to be charmed -- if that is the 
right word -- by corps after corps of cutesy creatures on tippy-toes. 
</P>
<P>
After many a Yule, the swan turns into a sugarplum. Sigh. 
</P>
<P>
That's just the beginning. Mice dance, and toy soldiers prance. Flowers waltz. 
Fake Christmas trees become skyscrapers before our wandering eyes. 
Incipient-ballerinas pretend that they are just sweet little girls, and 
danseurs nobles masquerade as heroic nutcrackers. 
</P>
<P>
It tends to be worse than fruitcake. Even with Tchaikovsky's wondrous score, it 
is more than some of us fossils can bear. 
</P>
<P>
This year, this fossil thought he'd try something different. That turned out to 
be a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of all the predictable dross from Drosselmeyer, in place of the fey 
adventures in Candyland of adorable little Clara or Masha or Marie or Gelsey or 
whatever her name is, your faithful long-suffering, callous, curmudgeonly 
scribe opted for the world premiere, in San Diego, of something billed as a 
"family ballet." 
</P>
<P>
As the cruel Fates would have it, "The Velveteen Rabbit," which opened a 
seven-performance stand at the Spreckels Theater on Wednesday, offers very 
little for anyone in the family older than 4 1/2. And it isn't much of a 
ballet. 
</P>
<P>
At least it is short. The opening performance began at 8, paused for a merciful 
intermission, and still ended before 9:30. 
</P>
<P>
On second thought, it didn't seem all that short. It seemed like a 15-minute 
dancing-school skit padded and padded and padded with pretension and irrelevant 
exercises. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, any benign observer with a head full of holly would shrug a shoulder 
or two and walk away whistling a happy carol. As Mama always said while she 
wagged her trusty forefinger, "If you can't say something nice, don't say 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Sorry, Mama. 
</P>
<P>
This production shouldn't have looked so amateurish. Tickets cost as much as 
$30. It shouldn't have sounded so perverse. 
</P>
<P>
It was staged by a respectable ensemble called ODC/San Francisco (the initials 
stand for Oberlin Dance Collective), and it made the ambitious trip southward 
with help from some impressive sources: Wells Fargo Bank, the city of San Diego 
and the California Arts Council, not to mention the GAP Foundation and Reader's 
Digest. 
</P>
<P>
If only credentials could dance. If only the people responsible for this 
quasi-translation of Margery Williams' children's book had approached their 
task with a bit more wit, with a better sense of focus, and with some notion of 
narrative style. 
</P>
<P>
"The Velveteen Rabbit" is, you may recall, the harey tale of a stuffed animal 
that becomes a real honest-to-goodness thumper through the magic of innocent 
love. The fragile story warms the cockles of the heart -- well, some cockles, 
anyway. To achieve credibility in the rarefied land of the arabesques, however, 
it would need the vision of a really imaginative, tasteful, whimsical 
choreographer -- preferably a genius. 
</P>
<P>
Where is Frederick Ashton when we need him, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
The craftsperson on duty here is KT, a.k.a. Katie, Nelson. She has cranked out 
a lot of clumsy pantomime and a little hopping, skipping, flopping and posing 
to accompany -- sometimes to illustrate and occasionally to contradict -- a 
taped reading of Williams' text. Nelson asks her hard-working little ensemble 
to execute maneuvers that vacillate between dull literalism and clumsy 
abstraction. 
</P>
<P>
For the score, which ought to be charming, Nelson misappropriates some dark and 
serious music of Benjamin Britten, interspersed with inane ditties by one Bob 
Franke. For sets and costumes, Brian Wildsmith has designed bargain-basement 
decorations that look improvised, which is OK, and uninspired, which isn't. 
</P>
<P>
Geoff Hoyle provides the voice on the soundtrack. Lizanne McAdams owns the body 
trapped in the unchanging, saggy rabbit suit of the titular toy. Robert Moses 
is the very manly boy who cuddles her in fragmentary pas-de-deux embraces. 
Julie Kanter owns the upper torso of the towering housekeeper who keeps an 
untitled porteur under her skirts in a pallid out-take from Pilobolus. Lisa 
Wallgren impersonates a Skinhorse who is skinny if not horsey and, more 
serious, seems neither wise nor worn. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone tries to be engaging and cute and ultimately poignant. In vain. 
</P>
<P>
Back to those infernal snowflakes in tutus. Back to nasty friend Fritz and his 
hostile army. Back to Mother Ginger and her ever-multiplying Kinder. 
</P>
<P>
Humbug.

STAGE BEAT: A CHARMING REVIVAL OF 'CARNIVAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Broadway musical "Carnival," based on the enchanting movie "Lili," has been 
charmingly revived at the Group Repertory Theatre in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The wide-eyed central character, who joins a tawdry circus troupe, is 
delectably portrayed by Lauren Hathaway. For those of us who fell in love with 
Leslie Caron in the 1953 MGM movie, Hathaway's wispy innocence and her lovely 
rapport with the carnival puppets cast a warm memory. 
</P>
<P>
Director-choreographer Dom Salinaro has caught the milieu of a bedizened little 
circus in a small southern European town. The show (originally staged by Gower 
Champion in 1961) is fragile and airy in its best moments, fulsome and garish 
in its sideshow pizazz. 
</P>
<P>
The cast is vocally ample, especially Hal Cobb's love-smitten, lame, embittered 
puppeteer. Musical director Craig Fenter has squeezed Bob Merrill's score onto 
a synthesizer, making it workable. 
</P>
<P>
The material can be clunky and mawkish, but there's a lilt that's entrancing. 
Actors sing, dance, walk on stilts, do magic tricks and work puppets. Flavorful 
characters are rendered by Gay Storm's saucy circus queen, Louis Herthum's 
romantic Don Juan and Larry Eisenberg's wise, jaunty puppeteer. 
</P>
<P>
It's a great show for children. 
</P>
<P>
"Carnival," Group Repertory Theatre, 10900 Burbank Blvd., North Hollywood, 
Fridays, Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 5 p.m. Ends Feb. 9. $10-$15; (818) 
769-PLAY. Running time: 2 hours, 15 minutes.

Open Fist's 'True West' Packs Powerful Punch 
</P>
<P>
A new theater company in Hollywood calls itself the Open Fist and puts its 
action where its mouth is. Its production of Sam Shepard's "True West" smacks 
you like an open fist. Shepard's 1980 drama about a screenwriter and his desert 
mongrel of a brother has a comic surface and a maniacal interior that can be 
gripping if the play is staged with the right electrical currents. 
</P>
<P>
The conduit here is director Ziad Hamzeh, who hot-wires this play with 
consummate skill. Actors Tim Pulice and Michael Denney are the warring brothers 
caught in the decay of the West as echoed by the baying of coyotes in a 
Southland suburb. They spar with verbal uppercuts, physical counterpunches and 
a simmering fury that signal strong promise for this company. 
</P>
<P>
"True West" was a risky choice. It's been done so much. But the details create 
hilarious chaos, from the elaborate kitchen set (while mom's away the kids will 
play) to a dozen burning toasters and the growing garbage heap of clutter. 
</P>
<P>
Pulice's civilized, businesslike demeanor as the screenwriter is sharply offset 
by Denney's ne'er-do-well brother whose scroungy hair and beard, and 
demonic/yearning eyes convey danger. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers' role reversal is ripe stuff, and Brian Muir's movie producer is 
on target (down to bare feet in loafers). Only the mother (Judith Montgomery) 
seems bland. The Quonset hut of a theater is dank, but this is true Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
"True West," the Open Fist, 1625 N. La Brea Ave., Fridays, Saturdays, 8 p.m. 
Ends Saturday, resuming Jan. 4-26. $12-$14; (213) 882-6912 or (213) 281-8325. 
Running time: 2 hours.

<P>
'Doughball' an Uneven Outing at East West 
</P>
<P>
Local Sansei playwright Perry Miyake has written a memory play, "Doughball," 
that captures third-generation Japanese-American high school kids in the last 
summer of their innocence at a Japanese community carnival in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
The premiere at East West Players in Hollywood is uneven. The play lacks 
momentum, but late in the second act one actor almost salvages the show. 
Hovering in the background as a silent, pony-tailed Vietnam-scarred veteran is 
the compelling Craig Ng. When his turn comes, Ng hurls the play like a javelin 
into another orbit. 
</P>
<P>
The playwright's apparent alter-ego and central character is a moony, 
naive/gung-ho Venice High senior circa 1970, endearingly played by Steve Park. 
His dreamgirl is the untouchable Patricia Ayame Thomson. But the brash high 
school buddy played by Yuji Okumoto is overripe, full of mugging that director 
Patricia S. Yasutake should step in and squash. 
</P>
<P>
Lissa Ling Lee, with a delicate touch, is a shy classmate who (with Park) helps 
frame the story from the adult perspective. The title refers to a game of 
chance played at the annual Venice carnivals fondly rekindled here, but with 
only random, not tight focus. 
</P>
<P>
"Doughball," East West Players, 4424 Santa Monica Blvd., Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 
p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends Jan. 20. $12-$15; (213) 660-0366). Running time: 1 
hour, 45 minutes.

HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW IN VIDEO: 'DICK TRACY' CASSETTE HAS A LOT GOING FOR IT; 
</P>
<P>
THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There are several good reasons for renting the just-released videocassette of 
"Dick Tracy" (Touchstone, $92.95, PG), even for someone who's already seen the 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* To fully appreciate Warren Beatty's strong work both as director and in the 
title role. 
</P>
<P>
* To enjoy the sexy performances by Madonna (as Breathless Mahoney) and Glenne 
Headley (more subtle, but just as impressive, as Tess Trueheart). 
</P>
<P>
* To test your TV's color fidelity, especially as Richard Sylbert's color-coded 
sets fill the screen. 
</P>
<P>
* To still-frame and examine those intricate, special-effects cityscapes. 
</P>
<P>
* To see (again freezing the picture) if you can identify big stars Al Pacino, 
Dustin Hoffman and James Caan -- portraying Chester Gould's grotesque gangsters 
behind all that makeup. (And maybe you can finally figure out what Mumbles, 
played by Hoffman, is mumbling.) 
</P>
<P>
There's a lot more going for this delightful interpretation of the classic 
comic strip -- including young Charlie Korsmo's performance as "The Kid" and 
the great music by Danny Elfman (score) and Stephen Sondheim (songs). 
</P>
<P>
Of course, "Dick Tracy" has its flaws, too -- a sometimes confusing and 
increasingly uninvolving plot, an overuse of (not very good) montages. But even 
if the wrapping outshines the contents, this is a Christmas present to be 
grateful for. 
</P>
<P>
Also out this week: "The Ewok Adventure" (MGM/UA, $79.98), the 1984 TV movie 
that charmingly employed those fuzzy-wuzzies from George Lucas' "Return of the 
Jedi," and an offbeat adult comedy about what it's like to struggle in 
Hollywood: "Pucker Up and Bark Like a Dog" (Fries, $79.95, R), with cameos by 
Robert Culp and Phyllis Diller. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
If you're a fan of those old Saturday-matinee serials, Republic has packaged 
every episode of four more from the late 1930s ($29.98 for each of the four 
tapes): 
</P>
<P>
* "Robinson Crusoe of Clipper Island" -- later retitled "Robinson Crusoe of 
Mystery Island," but having more to do with the foes of freedom (circa 1937) 
than Defoe. 
</P>
<P>
* "S.O.S. Coast Guard." No, it's not a boatload of marijuana, it's an evil 
scientist (Bela Lugosi) who wants to rule the world. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Painted Stallion." With a mysterious masked rider aboard, natch. 
</P>
<P>
* "Undersea Kingdom." Also known as "Sharad of Atlantis," this below-sea and 
below-par adventure stars Ray (Crash) Corrigan. TERRY ATKINSON

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: BLASTS FROM THE PAST, VIETNAM-STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's one-o-eight (in the morning)," the voice says at the beginning of K-tel's 
new "Rock Radio Vietnam" album. "Welcome into a Wednesday from Saigon. Army 
specialist Jim Amross . . . going to shake up your soul with Delaney, Bonnie 
and Friends." 
</P>
<P>
After playing the record "Shake Your Soul," Amross returns with an 
announcement: "It's more than just a piece of paper. . . . It's more than ink 
and a few pictures. It's a newspaper. . . . It's word from the States. Share 
the Stars and Stripes with your buddies. . . . Pass it on if you get a copy." 
</P>
<P>
Is the album another nostalgia re-creation? 
</P>
<P>
Not this time. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock Radio Vietnam" is taken from the tape of an actual 1970 Armed Forces 
Radio broadcast by Amross, one of the network's disc jockeys in Vietnam at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcast includes 10 songs -- from Aretha Franklin's "Don't Play That 
Song" and Free's "All Right Now" to Hotlegs' "Neanderthal Man" -- and various 
public-service announcements. Among the latter: an anti-drug message, a 
reminder of the deadline for sending Christmas gifts back to the States and 
information about absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
"There were several nostalgia collections geared to the Vietnam era when the 
film 'Good Morning Vietnam' came out a few years ago, but they were basically 
just songs from the era," said Steve Wilson, manager of product development for 
K-tel. 
</P>
<P>
"So, we were intrigued when a Vietnam veteran, Rick Thompson, came to us with a 
reel-to-reel tape of an actual broadcast. It seemed to work on several levels 
-- the music was interesting and it also captured a moment in history." 
</P>
<P>
K-tel then obtained clearances from Amross, who now does radio and television 
commercials in the Midwest, and the record companies whose songs were featured 
during the broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
Because the sound quality of the music on the tape was uneven, K-tel went back 
to the original recording company masters of the songs to give the compact disc 
a cleaner sound. Two of the tracks -- Freda Payne's "Deeper and Deeper" and 
Chairman of the Board's "Everything's Tuesday" -- are reportedly appearing on 
CD for the first time in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said that the K-tel marketing campaign will concentrate heavily on 
magazines directed at Vietnam veterans. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some concern at first about whether Vietnam veterans would want to 
be reminded of those days -- whether the music would bring back bad memories," 
he said. "But we spoke with some veterans and they said they remember the music 
and broadcasts fondly because the music always represented a touch of home." 
</P>
<P>
IN THE STORES: Albums recently released on CD for the first time or recently 
added to a label's budget series include the Cowboy Junkies' "Whites Off Earth 
Now!!" (the group's first Canadian album), "The Best of the Bonzo Dog Band" 
(the satirical outfit's first CD collection), David Bowie's "David Bowie at the 
Tower Philadelphia" (one bonus track) and Bowie's "Diamond Dogs" (two bonus 
tracks), the Grateful Dead's "Reckoning," and Tom Waits' "Closing Time" and 
"Heart Attack and Vine."

HOME TECH / LASER BIN: 'RHYTHMSTICK' HAS JAZZ'S BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Rhythmstick" (CTI). High definition, letterbox format. Multitrack digital 
audio. $40. 
</P>
<P>
"Rhythmstick" features Dizzy Gillespie, Art Farmer, Tito Puente and 15 other 
international jazz all-stars in the first in a series of audio-visual projects 
from CTI. The company, which in the '70s and '80s presented such artists as Bob 
James and Freddie Hubbard, has been revitalized under the direction of its 
founder, jazz producer Creed Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by the Japanese Seibu Saison Group, CTI plans to release a number of 
jazz projects that, like this one, will be available on laser discs as well as 
VHS and theatrical formats. 
</P>
<P>
"Rhythmstick," with 1,125 lines of horizontal resolution per frame (at 30 
frames per second) has a look approaching 35mm film (despite the American TV 
limitation of 525 scan lines). Filmed at Rudy Van Gelder's New Jersey studio, 
the disc features gorgeously colorful performance segments of Gillespie, 
Farmer, Puente, Bob Berg, Flora Purim, Airto Moriera and others in action. 
Contrasting with the crystal-clear playing portions are several black-and-white 
conversational interludes with some of the participants. 
</P>
<P>
This is a first-rate project, and Taylor and his crew, if they maintain this 
quality level in future productions, will be setting a standard that will be 
hard to beat. 
</P>
<P>
The corresponding "Rhythmstick" CD (CTI) obviously focuses entirely on the 
music. Gillespie is spotlighted and plays particularly well on Latin-rhythm 
pieces, especially Michel Camilo's "Caribe" and Benny Golson's romping 
"Palisades in Blue." 
</P>
<P>
However, the scene-stealer here is altoist Phil Woods, who plays with a fire 
and fury that is virtually unquenchable. His work on "Friday Night at the 
Cadillac Club" and "Nana" sizzles, a classic example of the contemporary 
viability of the be-bop style. 
</P>
<P>
Other high points include Flora Purim's soaring vocals on Tonino Horta's lovely 
ballad "Waiting for Angela" and tenor saxophonist Bob Berg's surprisingly 
powerful mainstream drive in his few appearances. DON HECKMAN

IRAQI MISSILE TEST CAUGHT U.S. COMPLETELY OFF GUARD; 
</P>
<P>
GULF CRISIS: SOME OFFICIALS THOUGHT WAR WAS ABOUT TO ERUPT. INCIDENT RAISES 
QUESTIONS ABOUT INTELLIGENCE EFFORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT C. TOTH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The launching of three medium-range Iraqi missiles in what turned out to be a 
test caught American intelligence agencies so completely by surprise early this 
month that some U.S. officials feared war was about to erupt in the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
And the failure of America's sophisticated satellite system to detect what was 
afoot until the first missile had been in flight for six minutes and was only 
one minute from impact raises serious questions about how much warning time 
U.S. forces would have in the event of a real attack. 
</P>
<P>
Officials previously had believed that Iraq could not carry out the several 
hours of fueling and other prelaunch preparations needed for such missile 
firings without detection by U.S. satellites and other sensors -- ostensibly in 
time for an American counter-strike before the Iraqi weapons could lift off. 
</P>
<P>
In the test, however, the Iraqis completed all the preparations and even the 
first launch without being discovered. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts say privately that the incident -- first reported by the Financial 
Times of London and confirmed by U.S. officials -- represents a significant 
intelligence failure. While some Pentagon and Administration officials dispute 
that assessment, one Administration official admitted the firings "gave us 
pause." 
</P>
<P>
"We had no advanced warning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 2 missile launches were a surprise even though Iraq had openly warned 
airliners to keep out of its airspace after midnight the night before. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad gave no reason, but on the strength of the warning, Israeli pilots were 
reportedly ordered to be in their cockpits, ready to strike back if Israel were 
attacked during the period. U.S. aircraft were also at a very high state of 
readiness and would apparently have retaliated if the missiles had been 
directed at U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people were in their cockpits ready to go," a senior U.S. official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
British and other allied forces were on high alert too, according to European 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
But no one knew what the Iraqis were planning, and indications are that 
American intelligence was surprised not only by the launches but also by both 
the launching point and the direction in which the missiles were fired. 
</P>
<P>
The nearness of war was seemingly confirmed this week by the chief U.S. 
diplomat in Baghdad, Joseph C. Wilson IV. He received an urgent telephone call 
the morning of Dec. 2 from the State Department in Washington, he said, 
informing him that "the balloon is going up -- this is no drill." 
</P>
<P>
The warning apparently was flashed to Wilson soon after the launch of the first 
missile was detected. 
</P>
<P>
Though many details of what happened remain unclear, it is known that the three 
missiles were fired at half-hour intervals, beginning at 4 a.m., from a site 
near Basra, in southeastern Iraq. They traveled westward more than 400 miles, 
toward Israel, but fell in a remote part of Iraqi territory. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has a variety of missiles with different capabilities. If missiles of the 
type used in the test had been fired southward, they had sufficient range to 
hit U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia. If launched from the western part of Iraq, 
instead of from a point near Basra, they could have reached Jerusalem and Tel 
Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said they believe the missiles tested, thought to be so-called Abbas 
weapons with a range of 500 miles, have relatively poor accuracy and relatively 
small payload capacity. If equipped with chemical warheads, however, officials 
said they could have caused considerable casualties. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials, by terming the firings a "test," suggested the missiles were 
not production models deployed to troops in significant quantities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they emphasized that the missiles were launched from near Basra, 
"rather than from where people were looking and alert to," as one official 
said, "and they were not aimed in the threat direction." 
</P>
<P>
The implication is that U.S. attention was focused on two identified Iraqi 
missile sites, located at airfields called H-2 and H-3 in the western part of 
the country, where Iraq's longer-range missiles are believed to be kept. 
</P>
<P>
But Seth Carus of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who follows 
Mideast weapons developments, said it was "odd" that U.S. intelligence sensors 
were not also trained on the Basra area, from which shorter-range missiles 
could be fired against U.S. forces to the south. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the anticipated trajectories of hostile missiles are programmed into 
the sensors to alert U.S. forces automatically to any incoming weapon. Some 
analysts suggest that southern trajectories from Basra were programmed into the 
sensors, as were western trajectories from H-2 and H-3, but not westerly paths 
from Basra. 
</P>
<P>
Another important issue, Carus said, is whether the missiles tested were a new 
and improved version of known Iraqi weapons. If the accuracy and payload 
capacity of the longer-range missiles were significantly better, the threat to 
Israel, Saudi Arabia and U.S.-led forces would become markedly greater. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq reportedly has more than 200 missiles of four types, all of them either 
Soviet-made or modified versions of Soviet weapon. The four are code-named 
Frog, Scud-B, Hussein and Abbas. 
</P>
<P>
Frogs have a range of about 50 miles, Scud-Bs about 220 miles, Husseins 400 
miles and Abbases 500 miles. How many of each type Iraq has is not known, but 
the latter two missiles are believed to number fewer than 50. 
</P>
<P>
The Hussein and Abbas are modified versions of the Scud-B, which can hit within 
about half a mile of its target carrying a payload of about half a ton. The 
Iraqi versions have much poorer characteristics; they are accurate to within 
only one to three miles of their aim point, according to a report by the U.S. 
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. Payloads may be as low as 300 pounds at 
maximum range. 
</P>
<P>
This means that, if used with chemical warheads at maximum range, at least a 
dozen missiles would have to be fired -- and at nearly the same time -- to 
produce lethal concentrations of a nerve agent, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Carus has calculated that to kill half the people in an area of about one-third 
of a square mile would require 28,000 pounds of the nerve agent Tabun, which 
the Iraqis are known to possess, if it were spread on the ground.

<P>
With the surprise resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze, the U.S. government lost the best friend it ever had in the 
Kremlin, a pivotal author of the post-Cold War Washington-Moscow partnership 
that stretched from Eastern Europe to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III gamely predicted that Soviet foreign 
policy will remain unchanged because President Mikhail S. Gorbachev wants it 
that way. But Baker acknowledged that the U.S.-Soviet detente might not have 
developed as it did if Shevardnadze had not been running Moscow's Foreign 
Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
"President Gorbachev has said there will be no change as a consequence of this 
resignation in Soviet foreign policy," Baker told a press conference devoted 
almost exclusively to Shevardnadze's departure. 
</P>
<P>
Baker seemed to be trying to put the best face on what, from Washington's 
standpoint, could become a disastrous development. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the next foreign minister adopts Shevardnadze's policies wholesale, the 
internal divisions in the Soviet Union highlighted by the foreign minister's 
stunning resignation could mean real trouble for future U.S.-Soviet relations. 
</P>
<P>
Baker put aside his generally optimistic assessment to suggest that the world 
should take seriously Shevardnadze's warning that the Soviet Union may be 
headed for dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
"We really are not in a position today . . . to absolutely guarantee that it 
(dictatorship) won't be the case," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
George Carver, former deputy director of the CIA, said, "Shevardnadze seems to 
be willing to put a warning shot across Gorbachev's bow. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a major cat fight brewing in the inner circle of the Politburo, 
that will obviously affect U.S.-Soviet relations," Carver said. "The stresses 
on the Soviet Union are such that the chances of major tears along major seams 
are getting greater every day." 
</P>
<P>
The sort of political instability highlighted by Shevardnadze's resignation is 
a central concern of a new study of the Soviet economy due to be released today 
by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The two institutions 
advise against extensive Western financial aid to the Soviets "until we know 
who's running the shop," as one official familiar with the report put it. 
</P>
<P>
The report was requested by the leaders of the world's seven largest industrial 
democracies at their July summit meeting in Houston. It will provide the first 
detailed, internationally accepted set of statistics on the Soviet economy and, 
overall, portrays the nation in "very gloomy" terms, the official said. World 
Bank President Barber Conable and IMF Executive Director Michel Camdessus 
delivered the report to President Bush in a White House meeting Thursday 
morning. Until Shevardnadze's successor is selected, there will be no way to 
assess the full impact of the change. But there seems to be no one on the scene 
with Shevardnadze's prestige or forceful personality. 
</P>
<P>
"Will Shevardnadze's successor have the same standing with Gorbachev to allow 
him to overrule the military or to cooperate with the United States in the 
Persian Gulf?" asked Dimitri Simes, a senior associate of the Carnegie 
Endowment for International Peace. "If Shevardnadze's desperation is justified, 
if indeed there is a profound crisis in the Soviet Union, then all relations 
with the Soviet Union are in doubt." 
</P>
<P>
Simes, a Soviet emigre, said that Gorbachev's government does not have the same 
clear-cut division of responsibility that exists in the U.S. Cabinet. 
Therefore, he said, it is not possible to be sure how much influence 
Shevardnadze had over Kremlin policy. But from Moscow's reaction to the Persian 
Gulf crisis, Shevardnadze's influence seems to have been profound. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Baker and Shevardnadze have worked 
together to orchestrate international solidarity against Saddam Hussein. 
Throughout the crisis, Shevardnadze has offered staunch support for the U.S. 
belief that military force may have to be used to end Iraq's occupation. At the 
same time, Gorbachev has shown much more reluctance to condone military action. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, Shevardnadze said in an American television interview that if the 
U.N. Security Council authorized the use of force in the gulf, the Soviet Union 
would send troops to participate. The comments produced a storm of criticism in 
the newly democratic Soviet Parliament, and Shevardnadze immediately disowned 
his own comments. 
</P>
<P>
"Shevardnadze was on board with the idea that the United States might have to 
use military force in the gulf," said Raymond L. Garthoff, a former State 
Department expert on the Soviet Union who is now a senior fellow of the 
Brookings Institution in Washington. "Gorbachev, while not ruling out force, 
had been hoping to avoid that possibility." 
</P>
<P>
It is probably unlikely that Gorbachev will reverse Soviet support for U.S. 
policy in the gulf at this late date. But Moscow's backing may become somewhat 
less outspoken. 
</P>
<P>
In the 23-month tenure of the Bush Administration, Baker and Shevardnadze held 
25 formal meetings, nine of them since Iraq invaded Kuwait less than five 
months ago. In a very real sense, the U.S.-Soviet relationship has become the 
Baker-Shevardnadze relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"On a purely personal note, I am going to miss him," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had staked too much on his friendship with Shevardnadze, Baker 
said: "We have not risked anything because we have developed a good personal 
relationship with the foreign minister of the Soviet Union. . . . Our policy 
toward the Soviet Union does not rest on personalities, never has, still 
doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not. But even under the most favorable circumstances, it will take some 
time for Baker and a new foreign minister to develop the same rapport that made 
the Baker-Shevardnadze relationship so smooth. 
</P>
<P>
And it was with obvious pride that Baker cited some of the results of his 
partnership with Shevardnadze: peaceful democratization of the previously 
Communist regimes of Eastern Europe; reunification of Germany and U.S.-Soviet 
cooperation in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"Without trying in any way to suggest that there was any difference between 
President Gorbachev and Minister Shevardnadze, because I don't think there was, 
I'm not sure that (those results) would have happened had he not been foreign 
minister of the Soviet Union," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the supervision of Baker and Shevardnadze, U.S. and Soviet negotiators 
have wrapped up 95% of a new treaty reducing by at least one-third the U.S. and 
Soviet arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons. Bush and Gorbachev hope to sign 
the pact at a summit meeting in Moscow in February. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said he does not expect Shevardnadze's resignation to derail the arms 
talks.

THE PASADENA FREEWAY, A FIRST IN THE WEST, APPROACHES ITS GOLDEN ANNIVERSARY AS 
A MARVEL OF ITS AGE -- AND WITH A BETTER SAFETY RECORD THAN MANY OF ITS MODERN 
COUNTERPARTS. 
</P>

Drive it the way you would dance. Curve, glide, turn; clutch, shift, 
accelerate. In the morning, it moves through alternate flickerings of shadow 
and light, cast by the lift and dip of the hills alongside. In the evening, it 
hurries through the black shade of green trees. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever other symbols have come to represent Los Angeles, the freeway is its 
most fitting. The movies are older, the climate is none of our doing, but the 
freeways are our gift and our endless joke; they make the place run or not run. 
The first of them, the mother and father of Western freeways, will turn 50 on 
Dec. 30 -- the golden anniversary of the Pasadena Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
In an age of technical marvels, it was a marvel of the age, a sunken six-lane 
parkway that snaked and bent along the riverbed of the green and pleasant 
Arroyo Seco, from the august banlieues of Pasadena to the nubby buildings of 
downtown. Over the miles their grandsires had needed a day to conquer on foot 
and horse, 1940 drivers could transit in the time it took to smoke a cigarette. 
Some committee, in a flush of civic lyricism, named it the Arroyo Seco Parkway. 
Locals called it "that ditch." 
</P>
<P>
This first of freeways, like the rest that would come, put form to fantasy. To 
drive a freeway became "a special way of being alive," wrote urban critic 
Reyner Banham, "a state of heightened awareness that some locals find 
mystical." To drive a freeway was to move "as a riverman runs a river," wrote 
Joan Didion, "every day more attuned to its currents, its deceptions." 
</P>
<P>
Rivers they are, great concrete rivers that in 50 years have carried our 
commerce and concerns farther afield than had been envisioned, farther indeed 
than many now wish they had. Freeways now divide our days as they divide the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
To the grim-eyed, hurried 1990s, the Pasadena Freeway has the look of a museum 
piece, dated as a zoot suit, narrow, awkward, pokey, perilous to the driver who 
does not know its quiddities and tricks. Along its 8.2 miles, from lower 
Pasadena past the Art Deco tunnels that once arched over Figueroa Street, it 
has no shoulders, almost no turnout bays and permits no big trucks. Its curves 
are thrill-ride sharp, its lanes a foot narrower than the current standard. 
People pull into their driveways faster than some of the Pasadena's exit ramps 
can accommodate. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a level of discomfort on the part of the motorist," says Keith 
Gilbert, the Automobile Club's manager of highway engineering, "but basically 
it's such a beautiful historic road, and learning to cope with it has made it 
an important part of the Los Angeles' infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Freeway ranks as the 12th busiest among Caltrans' 26 regional 
freeways. At a point near the Golden State Freeway, where it first carried 
27,000 cars a day, 127,000 now pass. On workday mornings, at each entrance ramp 
along its length, 10,000 cars join the inbound stream, to be siphoned off again 
each night. The stop signs and the hairpin ramps make it as self-metering as a 
modern freeway, without aid of red and green signals; its path through 
parklands is aesthetically and environmentally aware, if not altogether 
sensitive; a ban on trucks helps make it safer than some newer, more frantic 
lengths of urban freeway. 
</P>
<P>
In sum, it still moves. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is the on- and off-ramps. ... Those of us who use the freeway 
during morning hours I think are experienced enough to know how to merge. . . . 
I tell my friends, 'Don't be in that outside lane, it's dangerous.' I have many 
friends who say they don't like it all -- too many curves." 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Stanton Rubsamen was 17 in 1940, a high school senior plucked from a gym 
class to be later crowned Tournament of Roses queen. 
</P>
<P>
She lives in Pasadena, drives every day to her paralegal job downtown, along 
the length of what her son and daughter still call "mama's freeway." If she 
speaks of the Pasadena Freeway with crisp and analytical propriety, she is 
entitled. She is the one who officially opened it, she and the governor of 
California, tugging opposite ends of a red silk ribbon on a December morning 
she remembers chiefly for the throngs of people and the "rough policeman" 
warning a man -- her father -- not to touch the queen. 
</P>
<P>
"It works fairly well for being a small old freeway, but you probably have 
fewer strangers driving the Pasadena Freeway than you do most of the other 
freeways. If you've driven that thing 100 times or a thousand times, you get 
used to all the quirks and curves and drive it a whole lot better than some guy 
who's never been on it before." 
</P>
<P>
Nick Jones, Caltrans associate transportation engineer, is among those who 
believe that the Pasadena Freeway, for all its antique shortcomings, remains a 
pretty well-mannered piece of road, if sometimes balky. 
</P>
<P>
When first proposed, the publicity of the day promised Pasadena to downtown in 
10 minutes, a breeze of a journey past the fusty trolley lines that rattled 
alongside for a ways. The parkway designers intended drivers to enjoy the view 
at 45 m.p.h. Today, the trolleys gone, rush-hour motorists can enjoy the view 
at even greater leisure, like dead stops. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know much about freeways in those days. In fact, the Pasadena 
Freeway, what we now call a freeway, was conceived originally as being a 
leisurely scenic route. Speed and volume were not considered as being the main 
purposes of it. You were supposed to enjoy the park and view, and leisurely and 
safely go from L.A. to Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Himelhoch worked on the Pasadena and virtually every freeway in Los 
Angeles, starting in 1936 as head chainman on a survey crew and retiring in 
1974 as Caltrans deputy district engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Himelhoch recalled that at the time the Pasadena Freeway defined "the cutting 
edge of transportation development -- a "learning laboratory," said one 
engineer, for how to build more. 
</P>
<P>
An arroyo road had been talked about since it was surveyed in 1895; one man 
tried to start a bicycle trail, but nothing came of it. It took legislation to 
allow the designing of such a highway, with no intersections, no right of 
access from adjacent property. They didn't even know what to call it: "stopless 
motorway" was one suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
One or two parkways had already been built in the east; the beginnings of the 
autobahn were crossing Germany, broad enough to accommodate tanks, which they 
soon would. But an urban roadway -- there was no state of the art; they had to 
invent it as they went along. 
</P>
<P>
This, by the numbers, is what they built in 33 months: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Size 
</P>
<P>
Lanes at least a foot narrower than those mandated since. Originally, the two 
outside lanes were paved with white cement, and the two inside ones with black, 
on the curious theory that different-colored pavement would keep people from 
lane hopping. Emergency turnout bays were added in the 1950s, but nothing ever 
came of the notion that all six lanes be converted to one-way for morning and 
evening rush hours . . . nor of the idea to install coin-operated gas pumps for 
stalled cars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ramps 
</P>
<P>
Better suited to circus clown acts than modern cars. Unlike newer freeways, it 
has virtually no merging lanes on or off. The stop signs at the bottom of 
on-ramps were put there as a safety measure. Today, as traffic rushes by at 
shooting-gallery speed, you choose your moment and floor it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Curves 
</P>
<P>
That slight lift and tilt you feel instinctively when you take a curve, a sense 
that the road is banked to meet the centrifugal lean of the car -- that's 
called "super elevation." The Pasadena Freeway was super elevated, but for 45 
m.p.h. speeds, not 60. Hence the panicky feeling at taking those curves too 
fast. "We didn't understand freeways as high-speed high-volume facilities, so 
the fact it had relatively tight curvature wasn't considered that important in 
those days," Himelhoch says. "It's a matter of comfort, at least that's the 
word we use." Because of those curves, says California Highway Patrol Sgt. 
Michael Moses, "every so often you get somebody not real familiar with the 
freeway, and they realize, 'Well, I'm too hot into this.' . . . It gets tighter 
as you get into it, and you've got to constantly reduce your speed or you wash 
out." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Median 
</P>
<P>
About four feet wide, the median in 1940 was pleasingly landscaped with shrubs, 
to screen out the glare of opposing headlights and "so nobody would have a 
head-on collision," the designers noted with naive assurance. Naturally, the 
early smash ups were gory head-on affairs, cars leaping across that scant four 
feet. Most medians today are as much as 30 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trucks 
</P>
<P>
Almost alone among freeways, no trucks more than three tons are allowed, though 
out-of-state truckers who see only a freeway line on the map sometimes get 
stuck on it. For a time in the early 1950s, the freeway was opened to trucks 
after a truck driver appealed his conviction. But the weight restriction was 
reinstituted, and has held up. So -- mostly because of the truck ban- has the 
pavement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regulars 
</P>
<P>
Because it begins on a Pasadena street, and is not fully a part of the great 
tributary flow of freeways, it lacks much through traffic, says Jerry Baxter, 
district director for Caltrans. "You take the Santa Ana, Golden State, Ventura 
-- there's a lot of interstate traffic on those. The Pasadena is mostly local 
people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety 
</P>
<P>
With local drivers perhaps intimidated by the road's limitations into behaving 
themselves, the Pasadena Freeway does a bit better than its old roadbed might 
suggest. Its accident rate, says Caltrans, is 1.84 -- meaning 1.84 reportable 
accidents for every million vehicle miles traveled. That is higher than, say, 
the Long Beach Freeway, but lower than stretches of Interstate 5. In workaday 
terms, says Caltrans' Gary Bork, chief of the traffic operations branch: "I 
would say someone could travel the total length of that Pasadena Freeway every 
(work)day for 61 years and shouldn't expect to be in an accident" of reportable 
size. Compare that to an average of 8 or 10 years of accident-free driving on 
city streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speed 
</P>
<P>
With all those Le Mans curves curling out in front of your hood ornament, there 
are times on the drive to work, says commuter Blanca Dalziel, that "I sort of 
pretend I'm a race car driver. Not going 100 miles an hour but. . . ." We're 
conditioned to it -- when the signs say "freeway," the pulse says 65. But the 
Pasadena tends to enforce itself. When "some guy doing 65, 70" careens by, says 
Moses, and an officer gives chase, "we don't have to wait for him to see us. He 
has to slow down because one of the locals is up there ahead slowing him down." 
In a World War II "Drive for Victory" gas-saving campaign, squads of volunteer 
enforcers patrolled the lanes, holding traffic to a patriotic 40. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price 
</P>
<P>
About $5 million for the upper six miles, opened in 1940. A total of $12 
million by the time the final 2.2-mile link to the four-level interchange was 
done in 1953, before the name was changed to Pasadena Freeway, and the Ramona 
Freeway renamed the San Bernardino. Says Baxter: "We've gone from about a 
million dollars a mile to a hundred million" -- the unfinished Century Freeway. 
The Pasadena will stay the bargain it always was; to straighten it out, to 
widen its lanes out into parkland on either side, would require difficult 
engineering, ill-advised politics and impossible expense. 
</P>
<P>
"You always wonder 'what if?"' 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Baxter has worked at Caltrans since the great master plan of the 1950s was 
drawn. Once, he went home to Missouri, but farm-to-market roads held no 
challenge for him after freeways, and back he came. 
</P>
<P>
In his office is the vast map of freeways built and unbuilt, a vision of 1,200 
miles cross-hatching the area -- the Industrial Freeway, the Beverly Hills 
Freeway and one or two whose names he has forgotten. About half were built, 
most in the great years of the 1950s and '60s, before gas shortages and 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
There, on the wall, is the stub of the Pasadena, the first, and the Century 
Freeway, maybe the last for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had built more Pasadena Freeways to a lower (speed) standard and snaked 
them through the community and had less community impact in terms of land 
acquisition. . . . If you get hardheaded about freeways, which I suspect we 
probably did, and you say every freeway's got to be 8 to 10 lanes and every 
freeway's got to be designed for 70 miles an hour, there's no room for 
compromise. And it seems to me there's room for compromise. And maybe in some 
areas you say 'Why don't we design a four-lane, why don't we design one that 
has 50 m.p.h. speeds?' 
</P>
<P>
"Everything doesn't have to be the same."

JET TESTS NOT DONE, SAYS EX-OFFICER 
</P>

A former Air Force official said Thursday that the service, despite orders from 
Congress, failed to carry out a 1986 inspection of potential defects in some of 
Lockheed's C-5B cargo jets, raising new questions about whether the planes are 
safe to fly. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force had reported to Congress -- supposedly after conducting a 
detailed investigation -- that there were no flaws in the jets. At the time, 
the finding allayed doubts created by whistle-blowers' assertions that some of 
the huge jets had defective frames. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday, Lawrence B. Welborn, a retired lieutenant colonel, said in an 
interview that Air Force inspectors tested only "a small fraction" of the 
aircraft structures they later claimed in the report to have reviewed. Welborn 
said he was in charge of preparing the C-5B aircraft for inspection in 1986 at 
Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
A Lockheed spokesman strongly denied that the C-5B is flawed but said the 
company has "no firsthand knowledge of the details" of the Air Force's special 
inspection. Other tests, he said, show the aircraft do not contain structural 
defects. 
</P>
<P>
The C-5B aircraft are the largest cargo carriers used by the Air Force and have 
played a critical role in supplying material to Operation Desert Shield. The 
structural frames in question are so critical that their failure in flight 
could cause the aircraft to crash. 
</P>
<P>
The assertions by Welborn prompted a demand Thursday by Rep. John D. Dingell 
(D-Mich.), whose subcommittee on oversight and investigations requested the 
special inspection in 1986, for the Defense Department's inspector general to 
investigate whether the Air Force misled or submitted false documents to 
Congress. Dingell's call came after he obtained a copy of an affidavit taken 
from Welborn by attorney Herbert Hafif in connection with a Los Angeles civil 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
An Air Force spokesman said that as a matter of policy he would have no comment 
on a matter that may become the subject of investigation by the inspector 
general. 
</P>
<P>
In a harshly worded letter to Deputy Inspector General Derek Vander Schaaf, 
Dingell said Thursday that the Air Force or its top officers "attempted to 
deliberately mislead the subcommittee by submitting misleading or false 
documents to the subcommittee." 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing called by Dingell on Dec. 3, 1986, former Air Force Gen. Lawrence 
Skantze, who had been the Air Force's procurement chief, testified that the 
service had not accepted flawed aircraft parts. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Skantze pledged to thoroughly inspect the C-5B and report back to 
the subcommittee.

The report submitted Jan. 5, 1987, stated that 24 suspect forgings installed in 
three C-5Bs and one C-5A aircraft had been exhaustively inspected. Diagrams of 
the main frames -- circular structures up to 20 feet high that bear the planes' 
load in flight -- showed that hundreds of points were inspected. 
</P>
<P>
But in the affidavit obtained by Dingell and in an interview Thursday, Welborn 
said he was in charge of removing the acoustic and skin panels of the three 
C-5B aircraft that provided the inspectors with access to the main frames. Only 
one area of one C-5B was exposed for testing on Dec. 6, 1986, he said. No 
information is known about inspections of the C-5A, which apparently occurred 
at Lockheed's Marietta, Ga., plant the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the report to the subcommittee stated conclusively: "Structural integrity 
of the 24 suspected forgings was confirmed." 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with attorneys, company officials and congressional sources provided 
no information showing that Skantze himself knew that the tests had not been 
completed, even though he signed the report. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview late Thursday, Skantze said: "At the time I signed the 
letter, I had been assured that the inspection had been done. Given the gravity 
of the issue, I am appalled that our people would have assured me the job was 
done correctly, if indeed it was not done." 
</P>
<P>
The C-5B controversy appears to be escalating. 
</P>
<P>
Only last month, a Los Angeles jury imposed a $45.3-million judgment on 
Lockheed in a civil case in which two former auditors and a quality assurance 
representative asserted that they were fired after trying to alert management 
to the C-5B defects. It was these employees who initially brought the alleged 
defects to Dingell's attention in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The judgment is believed to be the largest in history against a defense 
contractor. Lockheed has asked for a new trial, claiming errors by the judge 
and jury misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, it was learned Thursday that the three former Lockheed employees 
have also filed suit against Lockheed under the federal False Claims Act, which 
allows individuals to sue defense contractors on behalf of the government. 
</P>
<P>
Hafif, the Claremont attorney representing the former employees, obtained a 
sworn affidavit from Welborn to support allegations in that suit. "We have the 
proof that the inspections were never done," Hafif said. "The track record of 
these aircraft shows there were problems from birth." 
</P>
<P>
The three former Lockheed employees have alleged that 26 forgings used in the 
main frames were improperly heat-treated and that they now contain 
metallurgical flaws. Two of the main frames were not used. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a defective oven, the main frames were overheated, resulting in a 
technical condition called "eutectic melting," in which certain metals inside 
the aluminum alloy melt and cause voids and cracks, the former employees said 
during the Los Angeles trial. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed asserted at trial that the employees had lied about the problem and 
that they were fired for falsely claiming that there was a management cover-up 
of the problem. Jurors later said in interviews that they were shocked by 
Lockheed's practices and wanted to send a message to the defense industry with 
the huge award. 
</P>
<P>
But throughout the case, Lockheed has strongly defended the aircraft. The 
company renewed its defense Thursday, amid the latest revelations. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no firsthand knowledge of the details of AF testing of C-5B main 
frames following Gen. Skantze's testimony before the committee," the Lockheed 
spokesman said. "We understand that Gen. Skantze advised the committee that 
tests did not disclose any metallurgical defects in the main frames. 
</P>
<P>
"In any case, the tests previously performed by Lockheed and validated by Air 
Force metallurgists established the metallurgical soundness of the main frames. 
We have absolutely no reason to doubt the general's testimony or the soundness 
of the C-5B." 
</P>
<P>
In the telephone interview, Welborn said the whole incident "bothers me 
tremendously," even though at the time he did not know precisely what the 
investigators from Air Force headquarters were looking for. 
</P>
<P>
Welborn said that to inspect as many points as were indicated in the 1987 
report, it would have required that several aircraft be inspected for a period 
of two to three days. But the investigators spent only an hour or two on the 
one aircraft, he said.

DEBT-REDUCTION BILL COULD COST COMMUNITY COLLEGES; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: PROVISION IN FEDERAL LEGISLATION TO CURB LOAN DEFAULTS COULD BLOCK 
ENROLLMENT OF 100,000 STUDENTS AND REDUCE AID, CHANCELLOR WARNS.

Federal legislation aimed at reducing the national debt also threatens to block 
the enrollment of 100,000 new students in California community colleges and 
could cost the institutions $200 million in lost federal aid, a top state 
educator said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the state's 107 community colleges have traditionally maintained open 
enrollment policies, new students without high school diplomas could be barred 
from entering the colleges under provisions of new federal legislation to curb 
defaults on student loans. 
</P>
<P>
Unless new legislation or some other remedial action is taken swiftly, state 
Community Colleges Chancellor David Mertes warned, "I view it as a major 
disaster for California community colleges." 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a U.S. Department of Education official agreed that the federal 
action could deal a major blow to the state's community college system but 
pledged to "work with California to ensure that this will not happen." 
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to helping the post-secondary education community implement 
this new law as smoothly and less disruptively as possible," said Bill Moran, 
director of the department's student assistance programs. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the community college chief and the U.S. Department of 
Education broke out Thursday, a day after publication of what Moran termed an 
explanation of the new legislation to curb mounting defaults on guaranteed 
student loan programs. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the budget deficit reduction package enacted Nov. 5, President Bush 
and Congress devised steps to try to prevent defaults on loans by former 
students, a major problem in some parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
One controversial provision of the legislation requires prospective college 
students without a high school diploma or its equivalent to take and pass an 
admissions examination called an "ability-to-benefit" test. Mertes said the 
federal action violates a California law that prohibits use of a standardized 
examination as a condition of enrollment at community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
The federal law takes effect Jan. 1 and Mertes said community colleges that 
admitted students who did not pass the tests would be liable, under the federal 
law, to lose $35 million in federal support for vocational education programs. 
Students stand to lose an additional $164 million in federal assistance. 
Traditionally, under the state's policy of "open" admissions at community 
colleges, anyone 18 or older is admitted, regardless of whether the student is 
a high school graduate. Tuition for each student is $50 per semester. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Mertes said projections show that about 100,000 new 
students a year could be affected. The state's total community college 
population is 1.5 million. Students already enrolled would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
Mertes said he is exploring possible legal action to prevent the loss of funds, 
but he is counting on sympathetic Californians in Congress to introduce 
legislation next month to protect the community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Mertes said he officially learned of the admissions test requirement on 
Wednesday and said that even if there were no conflict with California law it 
would be impossible to comply by Jan. 1 because a federally approved test could 
not be developed, administered and scored by then. 
</P>
<P>
The new term starts Jan. 1 for two-year colleges on the quarter system and Feb. 
1 for those on the semester system. Mertes estimated that most of the students 
affected by the federal action are in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego 
counties. He said campuses probably would risk admitting the students for now. 
</P>
<P>
Mertes said the education department's publication of a notice in the Federal 
Register of the testing requirement constituted a binding regulation affecting 
only community colleges in California because this is the one state with a 
"pure" open admissions policy. 
</P>
<P>
But Moran said federal action "is not a regulation drafted by the Department of 
Education. This is a law enacted by Congress. This is not something we just 
ginned up out of whole cloth." 
</P>
<P>
Moran said final regulations will be adopted after hearings are held and that 
the published "notice" was intended to alert states that the federally required 
tests were about to be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of California, Moran said, a "placement" test now given to students 
to determine their abilities in reading, writing and mathematics might be 
adjusted to include "some kind of a pass or fail test score for purposes of the 
law." 
</P>
<P>
But Mertes said California officials repeatedly tried to discuss the situation 
with the Department of Education but were shunted aside. "It was done in tight 
secrecy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moran, however, said that in drafting the explanation of the new law, officials 
"got as much input from the post-secondary education community as we could, 
given the amount of time we had to put it out."

SHIVERING FRONT BRINGS TOUCHES OF SNOW, RAIN 
</P>

<P>
Chilling blasts of Arctic air continued to ride through portions of Southern 
California on Thursday, dusting the mountains with snow overnight, dropping 
light rain in other areas and prompting a freeze warning for inland areas. 
</P>
<P>
Two to four inches of snow fell in the San Gabriel, San Bernardino and 
Tehachapi mountains, said meteorologist Marty McKewon of WeatherData Inc., 
which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"There were blizzard conditions in the Tehachapi Mountains," McKewon said, "and 
there was zero visibility at times." 
</P>
<P>
Warnings were issued to motorists, but Interstate 5 -- a major route to the San 
Joaquin Valley -- was not closed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It did not snow in Malibu, but in Santa Maria near the coast, snow fell for the 
first time in more than 40 years. Weather forecasters said the white stuff had 
not fallen in that area of Santa Barbara County since 1942, but Santa Maria 
Airport Manager Dan Hoback said he recalled a dusting in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the third grade when it fell," Hoback said. "We all left school and 
went outside to play in the snow." 
</P>
<P>
Heavy snow also fell in the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada on Thursday, 
although the snowfall did not near the 15 inches that accumulated on some peaks 
in the area last week, WeatherData forecaster Steve Burback said. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the activity is in the Sierra Nevada," Burback said. "The temperatures 
in the mountain ranges will be in the teens." 
</P>
<P>
The storm was a boon for ski resorts, which had sorely needed a decent 
snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
"We got about a foot of new snow," said Pam Murphy, a spokeswoman for Mammoth 
Mountain ski resort. "We are running four ski lifts now. Friday we will run 10 
lifts. We will run 13 for the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Most resorts in the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains expected to be in 
operation by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered rain showers were reported over a wide area of the Southland, but 
amounts were minimal. Precipitation included 0.60 of an inch of rain and snow 
at Big Bear Lake, 0.28 of an inch in San Juan Capistrano, 0.20 in Beaumont, 
0.12 in Avalon on Santa Catalina Island, and 0.02 in Lancaster and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Civic Center still has not received any rain this month and, if 
it does not rain by the new year, we will have the second driest July 1 to Dec. 
31 period since rainfall records began in 1877, the National Weather Service 
said. 
</P>
<P>
So far only .21 of an inch has been recorded downtown since July 1. The only 
other similar period with less rain was in 1962, when .12 of an inch fell. 
</P>
<P>
A state official said the rains and snow -- generated by the storm front that 
blustered in from the northwest -- would have little impact on the drought 
gripping the region. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get normal weather henceforth, we could wind up with a little bit more 
water than last year," said Maurice Roos, the chief hydrologist of the state 
Department of Water Resources. "If we continue at this pace, it'll be 
exceedingly dry and worse than last year." 
</P>
<P>
Roos described the current drought situation and the prospects for relief as 
"kind of grim." 
</P>
<P>
Unsettled conditions were expected to continue in the Southland through today, 
the first day of winter, with the possibility of showers in some areas of the 
parched Los Angeles Basin, McKewon said. 
</P>
<P>
The storm kept temperatures well below average. The high at the Los Angeles 
Civic Center on Thursday was 55 degrees, 13 degrees below the normal high, and 
only 4 degrees above the lowest maximum for date, set in 1909, the NWS said. 
</P>
<P>
The overnight low was 45, three degrees below normal for the date and 10 
degrees warmer than the record, 35, set in 1887. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said high temperatures will remain in the 50s in the Los Angeles 
area for several days. Overnight lows along the coast should be in the upper 
30s to mid-40s, and in the upper 20s to mid-30s in the inland valleys, where a 
freeze warning was issued and growers and residents were advised to protect 
sensitive outdoor plants. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to see some major (citrus and avocado) crop damage," said Ron 
Hamilton of the Weather Service office in Riverside, which monitors 
agricultural conditions in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture experts pointed out that the orange crop is maturing late, with as 
much as 75% of the crop still on the trees. Avocado growers have suffered 
freeze losses for four consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't be seeing any warming trend through Christmas," McKewon said.

BIAS VICTIMS MAY BYPASS RIGHTS PANEL, COURT SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: JUSTICES' DECISION WILL ALLOW PARTICIPANTS IN SEX DISCRIMINATION CASES TO 
SEEK POTENTIALLY LUCRATIVE COMPENSATORY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The California Supreme Court, denouncing the "pernicious influence of sexism," 
ruled Thursday that victims of sex discrimination may bypass the state civil 
rights commission and seek large damage awards in court. 
</P>
<P>
The justices unanimously rejected contentions by employers that bias complaints 
must be taken first to the state Fair Employment and Housing Commission, an 
administrative body that conciliates disputes and has only limited power to 
compensate victims. 
</P>
<P>
The court found that the anti-discrimination provisions of the state 
Constitution reflected a "fundamental public policy" against sex bias, 
entitling victims to seek potentially lucrative compensatory or punitive 
damages in court. 
</P>
<P>
"So long as (sexism) exists, we are all demeaned," Justice Edward A. Panelli 
wrote for the court. The decision caused some surprise, coming from a generally 
conservative court that only two years ago restricted the damages that workers 
can win for wrongful firing in cases not involving discrimination or a 
violation of public policy. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an encouraging sign to employees that the tide may have turned on the 
California Supreme Court," said John M. True, staff counsel of the Employment 
Rights Center in San Francisco. "The justices were invited to regress on 
employee rights in discrimination cases and they declined to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Steven G. Drapkin of Los Angeles, lawyer for the Merchants and Manufacturers 
Assn., voiced disappointment with the ruling. "This will create a lot of added 
litigation that otherwise could have been handled properly by the commission," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was one of three issued Thursday involving the extent to which 
employers may be held liable for violation of labor-protection laws. 
</P>
<P>
In a second pro-worker ruling, the justices unanimously permitted a state 
employee to seek compensatory and punitive damages under a "whistle-blower" 
protection law for stress-related injuries that he said resulted from 
harassment for his efforts to investigate official wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
In a third decision, the court, as expected, sharply limited the remedial power 
of the Fair Employment and Housing Commission, which receives about 8,000 
complaints of sex, race and other bias annually. The justices held 5 to 2 that 
the commission, unlike the courts, lacked authority to award compensatory 
damages for emotional stress and other intangible harm, and was limited to 
ordering back pay and reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
This decision followed a 1987 ruling that barred similarly lucrative punitive 
damage awards by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling opening the way for court action by bias victims resulted from a 
suit by Emma Rojo and Teresa Maloney against their former employer, Dr. Irwin 
H. Kliger of Los Angeles, charging that they suffered emotional distress from 
sexual harassment and improper demands. 
</P>
<P>
The women charged that they had been grabbed, kissed and fondled by the 
physician and were forced out of their jobs when they resisted his demands. 
Kliger denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
The high court rejected the employer's contentions that a worker must exhaust 
the administrative process before going to court. The justices noted that 
although the commission's procedures for conciliation, back pay and 
reinstatement may be effective for many workers, the judicial remedies of 
punitive and compensatory damages can provide the "only adequate form of 
relief" for others. 
</P>
<P>
The court also rejected employers' contentions that victims of sex bias could 
not sue for wrongful discharge as a violation of public policy. "No extensive 
discussion is needed to establish the fundamental public interest in a 
workplace free from the pernicious influence of sexism," Panelli wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for business groups expressed disappointment with the ruling. Fred J. 
Hiestand, general counsel for the Assn. for California Tort Reform, predicted a 
"boom" in employment litigation and increased legal costs for employers. 
Increasing numbers of aggrieved workers will go to court hoping for a "big 
jackpot," Hiestand said, while fewer people -- those more interested only in 
reinstatement -- will go to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
In the second case decided Thursday, Jack Shoemaker, a former special 
investigator for the state Department of Health Services, filed a lawsuit 
against the department seeking damages for stress-related injuries. Shoemaker 
contended that he had been harassed and then fired after he found, in an 
investigation, that officials might have improperly given funds to 
family-planning clinics that did not use licensed professionals. 
</P>
<P>
A trial court rejected the investigator's bid for damages and a state Court of 
Appeal agreed, ruling that Shoemaker could collect only the $140 per month 
payment he was due from the state workers compensation fund, the system 
established to provide for the work-related injury or death of an employee. 
</P>
<P>
In an opinion by Justice Armand Arabian, the high court held Thursday that the 
"whistle-blower" law was aimed specifically at protecting state workers who 
properly report unlawful governmental actions. Even though the workers 
compensation system was designed to comprehensively cover injuries on the job, 
Shoemaker could sue under the separate law aimed at deterring retaliation by 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The third case Thursday centered on a discrimination claim filed with the 
commission by Rose Brown against her former employer, the Peralta Community 
College District in Oakland. Brown, a temporary secretary, charged that she 
suffered emotional distress from sexual harassment by a college dean. 
</P>
<P>
The commission ruled in favor of Brown, ordering the district not only to 
reimburse the woman $374.55 in lost pay, but also $20,000 in compensatory 
damages for harm to her "dignity and esteem." 
</P>
<P>
The high court, in another opinion by Panelli, concluded that state statutes 
allow the commission only to order back pay and reinstatement to an unjustly 
fired worker or to issue orders barring discriminatory actions by employers. 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Marian M. Johnston and commission Executive Director 
Steven Owyang expressed disappointment with the court's limitation on 
commission power. While employees who go to court will profit from Thursday's 
rulings, those who choose the faster, less-expensive process of the commission 
will gain far less in compensation, they said.

HAPPY SAILORS RETURN FROM DUTY IN GULF 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After weeks in the suffocating heat of the Persian Gulf, a bit of cold rain in 
San Diego Bay hardly bothered the sea-weary sailors lining the deck of the 
Independence -- the biggest of four Navy ships to arrive in Southern California 
Thursday from duty in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be snowing here in San Diego for all I care," said radioman Alonzo 
Sims, wet and shivering in a stiff wind. "This is just the happiest day of my 
life. I'm like a kid at Christmas. I'm just so glad to be home." 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft carrier, with 5,100 sailors on board, slipped into its Coronado 
berth as more than 1,500 wives, mothers, fathers and children waited in the 
foul weather, clenching welcome-home banners and tissues for wiping away 
raindrops and tears. 
</P>
<P>
Up the coast in Long Beach, the weather was better for the return of the guided 
missile cruiser Antietam, one of the first ships into the Persian Gulf last 
August after Iraq's takeover of Kuwait. No rain awaited, just crisp cold and a 
Santa Claus -- not that any of the sailors needed a reminder that they had made 
it home for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best Christmas there could ever be," said Chief Petty Officer Greg 
Gimber, holding his 8-week-old daughter, Laken, for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Both ships are among the first to return to port from gulf duty. Also docking 
in San Diego Thursday were the Jouett and the Reasoner, both part of battle 
group Delta with the Independence. 
</P>
<P>
The 80,000-ton Independence became the first U.S. aircraft carrier since 1974 
to operate inside the Arabian Gulf when it passed through the Strait of Hormuz 
on Oct. 2. It left the Middle East in November. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking over our shoulder all the way back," ship supply officer 
Lonnie Mitchell said as he held three long-stem roses -- one each for his wife 
and daughters. "We knew we were in the world's biggest hot spot. Ask anybody 
here and they'll tell you we thought . . . all hell was going to break loose 
with us sitting right in the middle of it." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Independence crew spent many weeks languishing in the Gulf of 
Oman, out of sight of land. On some days the heat made the carrier's black deck 
feel like a big, iron griddle. 
</P>
<P>
"Some days it was 114 degrees on that deck. If you touched it, it scorched your 
hand," said Marine Lance Cpl. Steve Allen of Garyburg, N.C. "It got so bad, 
nobody wanted to go up on deck. But every day, the Marines were out there doing 
our exercises." 
</P>
<P>
When the Independence left San Diego in June, it was for a five-month 
deployment in the Indian Ocean. But the Kuwait invasion extended the tour. 
After the ship finally left the gulf, time seemed to drag as it neared home. 
</P>
<P>
"The hours go slower because you're looking forward to being home so much," 
said Ed (Dino) DiNatale. "I became a clock watcher. We all did." 
</P>
<P>
On the Independence deck, with the carrier in sight of the San Diego skyline, 
sailors began revealing their shore plans. 
</P>
<P>
Blake Brown, 20, of Columbus, Ohio, planned to spend his leave with his 
girlfriend. "We're going to check into a hotel in San Diego," Brown said. 
"During the next 10 days we might see the light of day -- but I doubt it." 
</P>
<P>
Below deck in the carrier's hangar, 50 anxious men had thoughts of babies on 
their minds -- the children born during their absence. It is the ship's custom 
to let them off first. 
</P>

Russell McKamey, 31, stood anxiously in line with gifts he had bought for his 
new son. A counselor told him to expect the baby to cry because he was used to 
being in the arms of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if he cries," McKamey said. "I'm going to hold him and squeeze 
him. Then I'm going to squeeze my wife until she cries. Then I'm going to cry. 
We'll all cry together." 
</P>
<P>
When the ship docked, McKamey and the other new fathers splashed through 
puddles to reach their families. A strapping man who stands taller than 
6-foot-4, McKamey embraced his wife and swung her off her feet. 
</P>
<P>
Then he placed her back on earth and gently touched her chin. But he could 
manage only three words which he whispered in her ear. She smiled and hugged 
him back. "I know," she said.

More than 30,000 people fled Vietnam in 1990 as "boat people," washing up as 
far away as the islands of Indonesia. Despite the huge size of the continuing 
exodus, the overall number of asylum-seekers was actually down compared to the 
previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in the number of refugees has many explanations: a virtual halt to 
asylum-seekers who are leaving Vietnam and a flood of propaganda about the 
hardships awaiting emigrants. In many parts of Asia, the door is simply 
slamming shut to them. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's economic situation continues to deteriorate, with large-scale 
unemployment. This year's refugee departures, although fewer than in 1989 and 
1988, are still higher than in any year since 1982. As time passes, it is 
harder for applicants to make a good case that they have suffered because of 
their association with the old South Vietnamese regime. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is a good example of the new trend. Last year, a flood of 34,622 
Indochinese refugees swept into the colony, overwhelming its facilities. Nearly 
all the new arrivals were from just four districts of northern Vietnam near 
Haiphong. 
</P>
<P>
This year, only 6,000 asylum-seekers have turned up, with only 500 coming from 
northern Vietnam. Of the remainder, mostly ethnic Chinese, a few hundred now 
travel by land routes through China, earning them the mocking Hong Kong 
sobriquet of "bus people." But they are a tiny minority. 
</P>
<P>
According to refugee officials and aid workers, the people of northern Vietnam, 
at least, have finally gotten the message that escape from Vietnam now means 
confinement in a detention camp rather than resettlement in California. That 
alone appears to have deterred thousands from leaving Vietnam this year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline in arrivals, the population of Hong Kong's detention 
centers has swollen to 52,953, with the increase in population (6,034 new 
arrivals and 2,500 births) hardly offset by the 5,700 camp inmates who 
volunteered to go home rather than face more time in confinement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are desperately trying to maintain temporary asylum in a region which is 
fed up with it," said Hong Kong's refugee coordinator, Clinton Leeks. 
</P>
<P>
That frustration is evident in such Southeast Asian nations as Malaysia, which 
since June has regularly towed boatloads of Vietnamese out to sea and handed 
them maps to Indonesia, and the Philippines. In July, however, the Philippines 
unofficially stopped accepting refugees plucked from the sea by passing ships. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Malaysia and the Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan are no longer 
accepting sea-rescue cases. With Indonesia's refugee camp at Galang bulging 
with more than 19,000 asylum-seekers, Western aid officials worry that the 
Jakarta government may be the next to stop offering shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is largely a dispute between the Asian nations and the United 
States over a passage in the 1989 Comprehensive Plan of Action that was adopted 
to deal with the growing tide of would-be emigrants. The plan provides for 
screening arrivals to determine if they are genuine political refugees or 
merely economic migrants looking for a better life. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone agrees that the genuine refugees should be resettled, but the rejected 
refugees are at the heart of the dispute. Hong Kong, Malaysia and other 
countries want to send them back home. The United States and, ironically, 
Vietnam vehemently oppose forced repatriation as inhumane. 
</P>
<P>
In September, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reached 
agreement with Hong Kong, Britain and Vietnam to try a new tactic: to send home 
asylum-seekers who did not volunteer but who also did not object to being sent 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Refugee officials from around the region closely watched the Hong Kong 
experiment. If it worked, the plan would be implemented elsewhere. So far, it 
has flopped. Only 23 people were sent back in the first group of 
"non-objectors" despite promises of equal treatment with volunteers. Back in 
Hanoi, they were horrified to hear Vietnamese officials threatening terms in 
re-education camps to non-objectors who step out of line. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most daunting of all, Hong Kong's program of screening prospective 
refugees is being tested in a court case that could wind up invalidating many 
of the 16,000 screenings which have already taken place.

JAPAN TO PUT BRAKES ON MILITARY BUILDUP; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: THE SLOWDOWN RECOGNIZES THAT COLD WAR TENSIONS HAVE FADED. HOST NATION 
SUPPORT FOR U.S. TROOPS WILL GROW.

<P>
In its strongest acknowledgment to date that Cold War tensions are fading in 
Asia as well as Europe, the Japanese government Thursday announced a five-year 
defense spending plan that will put the brakes on a longstanding policy of 
steady military buildup. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, approved by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's Cabinet, would also boost 
Japan's host nation support for U.S. troops stationed here by about $1.7 
billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo has been under pressure from U.S. officials and congressional critics to 
increase its contribution to the upkeep of about 50,000 U.S. servicemen and 
women in Japan, especially since the crisis in the Middle East erupted in 
August. Japan is offering to gradually raise its share of yen-denominated 
expenses, such as civilian wages and utilities at installations, from the 
present 40% to 50% by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Kaifu administration decided to cap the growth in defense 
spending at 3% a year and to sharply curtail a program of front-line military 
hardware procurement that has, since the mid-1970s, made the so-called 
Self-Defense Forces into a formidable military with state-of-the-art weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
The new "Mid-Term Defense Buildup Program," as the five-year plan is called, 
also cuts the authorized number of ground troops from 180,000 to 153,000. That 
is the number under arms in the Ground Self-Defense Force, owing to recruitment 
difficulties. Further cuts in all branches will be studied. 
</P>
<P>
"The Asia-Pacific region, although more complicated than Europe, has been 
affected by the changes in U.S.-Soviet relations, and there are positive moves 
toward a decrease in tension," Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet decision follows an explosive debate in Parliament over a ruling 
party proposal to dispatch personnel to the Persian Gulf, theoretically to 
support the U.S.-led military intervention there in a vaguely specified 
noncombat role. 
</P>
<P>
Asian neighbors victimized by imperial Japan during World War II raised 
objections, however, and the pacifist domestic opposition bitterly attacked the 
plan as opening the door to future revanchism. A humiliated Kaifu shelved his 
"U.N. Peace Cooperation" legislation early last month. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than seeking an expanded role for the Japanese military -- as the 
conservative wing of the Liberal Democrats envisioned in the aborted gulf bill 
-- the new five-year plan appears to signal coming retrenchment for a military 
establishment that many postwar Japanese have despised, ignored, or at the very 
least, felt acute discomfort toward. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred on by U.S. officials, the Defense Agency's budget has been increased by 
5% to 6% annually for more than a decade, despite tight fiscal constraints. 
Only the foreign aid budget has consistently had greater increases. The 
government set a nominal defense spending ceiling of 1% of gross national 
product in 1976, but a booming economy has ensured steady growth for the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
Japan now has the world's third-largest defense budget, when military pensions 
are counted. 
</P>
<P>
Total defense outlays for the fiscal years 1991 through 1995 will be an 
estimated $172 billion at current exchange rates, Sakamoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the plan limits spending growth in real terms to 3%, a figure roughly in 
line with normal fiscal expansion for other government agencies. Sakamoto said 
this target would be subject to revision only after three years -- and only 
downward. 
</P>
<P>
More emphasis than in the past will be placed on logistic support and troop 
welfare in lieu of weaponry, a Foreign Ministry official said.

HE'S MENTALLY READY TO ATTACK IRAQ, BUSH SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: THE PRESIDENT MEETS WITH CONGRESS MEMBERS AND RESUMES BLUNT WARNINGS 
TO SADDAM HUSSEIN.

<P>
President Bush told members of Congress on Thursday that he is mentally 
prepared to order an attack against Iraqi forces and that the best chance for 
peace is for Saddam Hussein to understand that if there is war, "he's going to 
get his ass kicked." 
</P>
<P>
One day after a senior U.S. commander in Saudi Arabia said his forces will not 
be ready on Jan. 15 to launch an attack, the President resumed what has become 
his primary message: a blunt and almost daily warning directed at the Iraqi 
president in the hope that he will recognize Bush's readiness to unleash a 
massive attack. 
</P>
<P>
To members of Congress just back from the Persian Gulf and facing the 
likelihood of debate early next month over whether to support the use of force, 
Bush made it clear he has "crossed the Rubicon" of deciding whether to order 
the still-growing U.S. force into action, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Emerging from one of two meetings Bush held with members of Congress on 
Thursday, California Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the 
House Intelligence Committee, said the President meant that "he's at peace with 
himself, that if military force is necessary . . . he can live with it." 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush "had crossed the Rubicon 
in his own mind in terms of being willing and able to use force and to defend 
the principles involved." But he said the President had, in effect, accepted 
the possible use of force when he first ordered U.S. troops to the gulf last 
summer, just after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The expression "crossing the Rubicon" comes from Julius Caesar's decision in 49 
BC to lead his forces across the small river, the Rubicon, that divided Gaul 
from the Roman Republic in what is now north-central Italy -- a move that began 
a civil war. 
</P>
<P>
With Bush and other Administration officials emphasizing the likelihood that 
warfare will erupt if Hussein does not withdraw from Kuwait, the President in 
recent days has been portrayed by his advisers as being at ease with his 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he has worked this thing and wrung it out to such detail that he's 
quite comfortable with where he has ended up with the options available to 
him," one senior White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
California Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) said Bush told one group of 
House members that Hussein does not comprehend the force he would face. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest potential for preventing any kind of an armed confrontation is to 
make sure that Saddam Hussein be made really aware that, to quote him (Bush), 
that 'if we get into an armed situation, he's going to get his ass kicked,' " 
Gallegly said. 
</P>
<P>
The President was also said by his visitors to have challenged any suggestion 
that economic sanctions be given several more months to pressure Hussein into a 
withdrawal from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should be waiting until next summer," Rep. Michael R. McNulty 
(D-N.Y.) quoted the President as saying. 
</P>
<P>
As he prepared to leave Washington today for Camp David, Md., where he is 
planning to spend the next 11 days, Bush faced the increasing likelihood that 
when Congress returns Jan. 3, the capital will become embroiled in a debate 
over the use of force in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said Congress will probably 
debate Persian Gulf policy early in January. But he said the precise timing of 
such a debate depends on whether Secretary of State James A. Baker III goes to 
Baghdad to meet with Hussein -- a visit that remains very much uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
The White House has continued to make clear that it would not object to a vote 
in Congress if it can be assured that such a vote would strongly support Bush's 
policy and would mirror a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use 
of all means necessary to remove Iraqi forces from Kuwait if they have not been 
withdrawn by Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said there have been "all kinds of discussions" over the possible 
language of a congressional resolution. 
</P>
<P>
"Every member of Congress that comes down here talks about the resolution, and 
everybody's got their idea of what it should be. Every committee up there (at 
the Capitol) has got 40 brilliant little staff guys running around, drafting 
resolutions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the Administration's concern over a congressional debate is 
the fear that it could suggest to Hussein that Bush lacks enough political 
support to launch an attack, thus weakening the threats that Bush hopes will 
lead the Iraqi president to retreat. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell said that in meetings with foreign leaders during his just-completed 
gulf visit, he reiterated that the United States is united in the feeling that 
Iraq must get out of Kuwait, by military force if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"The only question is whether this (use of force) will be the first resort or a 
last resort," Mitchell told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) said he favors continuing the sanctions, and he 
cautioned that the United States would suffer two-thirds of the allied 
casualties in any war with Iraq. But he said he agrees that if Hussein refuses 
to leave Kuwait because of economic sanctions or diplomatic efforts, force must 
be used. 
</P>
<P>
"Our forces are prepared to win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of a seven-member Senate delegation that included Mitchell and Simon, Sen. 
Richard C. Shelby (D-Ala.) was the most hawkish. 
</P>
<P>
"Our troops are ready," he said. "I have the feeling we're moving toward war, 
and it depends strictly on what Saddam Hussein does. . . . I hope Saddam 
Hussein will come to his senses. Sanctions will take too long."

Military Front: 
</P>
<P>
President Bush reportedly told members of Congress that Saddam Hussein is 
underestimating U.S. power and must be made aware that "if we get into an armed 
situation, he's going to get his ass kicked." The President also said he is 
mentally prepared to order troops into combat if Iraq does not withdraw from 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said U.S. warplanes could punish Iraq by the Jan. 15 
deadline. The warning came after the deputy commander of U.S. forces in Saudi 
Arabia said U.S. ground forces might not be combat ready for weeks after the 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
The United States joined other members of the U.N. Security Council in 
unanimously supporting the concept of an international peace conference at an 
appropriate time between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Israel has long opposed 
the concept. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Political Front: 
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell said he expects Bush to seek a war 
declaration from Congress before launching an offensive against Iraq. Bush said 
he'd welcome a strong resolution endorsing military action.

HIGHLIGHTS OF SHEVARDNADZE STATEMENT

<P>
The following are excerpts from Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze's resignation speech Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 Yesterday there were speeches by certain comrades . . . who raised the issue 
of adopting a special declaration forbidding the country's leadership and its 
president from sending troops to the Persian Gulf zone. . . . These . . . 
statements exhausted my patience. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No fewer than 10 times I had to make statements, both inside and outside of the 
country, clarifying the Soviet attitudes and policies in this conflict. It is a 
serious, sensible, well-thought-out policy. . . . We have friendly relations 
with the Iraqi state. . . . These relations remain in force, but we have no 
moral right to put up with the aggression against and annexation of a small, 
defenseless country. (To do so) we would have to renege on all that has been 
done by all of us, by the entire country and people in establishing the 
principles of new political thinking. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I (have) repeatedly clarified that the Soviet leadership has no plans (to send 
troops to the Persian Gulf). . . . But now they charge that the foreign 
minister has such a plan, the plan for disembarking troops in the gulf zone. I 
explained and stated there are no such plans; they are non-existent, quite 
simply. And no one is going to send there even a single serviceman, a uniformed 
representative of the U.S.S.R. armed forces. This was stated many times, but 
again some people find it necessary to raise the issue. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I said it and I now publicly confirm the fact that should the interests of 
Soviet citizens suffer . . . no matter where it happens, be it Iraq or any 
other country, the Soviet government . . . will protect its citizens and their 
interests. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I want to raise another issue. Is it accidental that two members of Parliament 
made a statement that the minister of interior has been removed and now the 
time has come to settle accounts with the foreign minister? . . . Are these 
boys in colonel's epaulets really so brave that they feel they may make such 
statements addressed to . . . members of the government? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Allow me to say a few words about personal dignity. . . . Many think that . . . 
members of the government, the president or anyone, have been hired, (that) 
they are serfs and can be treated in whatever way. I think this is 
impermissible. . . . Just read the press. . . . And what's most surprising. . . 
, who stands behind these comrades, and what is all this? Why (is) no one 
rejecting the charge (and saying) there are no plans? Perhaps there are such 
plans, after all? 
</P>
<P>
In this connection I recall the party congress. . . . During the congress we 
witnessed a . . . pitched battle between the reformers and reactionaries. I 
will not say now conservatives. I respect conservatives; they have their own 
views, acceptable for the society. Precisely, reactionaries. And this battle 
was won by the . . . progressive delegates of the congress, and they did so 
with dignity. 
</P>
<P>
I recall now how my name was put on the voting list without my consent and 
without asking me. And in secret ballot I received 800 votes against me. . . . 
Was this an accident or a trend? Was it the unacceptable policy pursued by the 
foreign minister, or the personality of the minister, at issue? . . . I think 
all this is not accidental. 
</P>
<P>
. . . I recall now the Supreme Soviet session. . . . The serious issue of the 
GDR (East German) treaties was put on the agenda. . . . By a coincidence, I was 
away at the time. My deputies were summoned, and they found themselves in (an) 
absolutely ridiculous situation. The whole thing just flopped. 
</P>
<P>
And I had to take the floor during the next week. And what happened? The same 
people, who are the authors of today's statements, made serious accusations 
against the foreign minister, of unilateral concessions, incompetence, 
illiteracy, etc. There was not a single speaker to object to the chairman of 
the session, to say this was dishonest, that this was not the correct way of 
doing it, that this was not how it is done in civilized states. 
</P>
<P>
I feel very strongly about it. They sank to personal insults, but I absorbed 
even that. Comrades, this is hounding. . . . Take, for instance, the Pamyat 
publications. What expressions they use! Down with the Gorbachev clique! They 
throw in my name and some others. Who are they, the so-called "reformers"? I 
have been shaken, comrades, by the events of the first day of our Congress (the 
Congress of People's Deputies, meeting this week). A mere push of the button 
decided the fate of not only the president, but the very policy of perestroika 
and democratization. 
</P>
<P>
Is it normal? Let me say openly, comrade democrats -- and I use this word in 
the broadest sense here -- you have fled. All reformers have taken to the 
hills. A dictatorship is advancing. I am saying this with full responsibility. 
No one knows what kind of dictatorship it will be, who will personify it, what 
kind of dictator he will be and what kind of regime it will become. 
</P>
<P>
. . . I am resigning. 
</P>
<P>
. . . Let this be my contribution, my protest against the advance of 
dictatorship. I express my deep gratitude to Mikhail S. Gorbachev. I am his 
friend. I am his co-thinker. I have always supported him and will continue to 
support the ideas of restructuring, renovation, democracy, democratization 
until the end of my days. 
</P>
<P>
We have done great things in the international arena, but I believe this is my 
duty as a man and a citizen, as a Communist. I cannot put up with the events 
which are happening in my country, and with the tribulations that lie in store 
for my people. I still believe, I believe that dictatorship will be repulsed, 
that the future belongs to democracy and freedom!

The first democratic all-German Parliament in 57 years convened in the historic 
Reichstag building Thursday, and its senior legislator, Willy Brandt, called on 
the united nation to shoulder greater global responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech to the new Bundestag, the policy-making lower house, the 
77-year-old former chancellor said that modernizing the former East Germany 
will be a huge task but must not detract from growing German duties around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"Germany would heap guilt on itself if out of its own concerns it forgot world 
concerns: hunger, migration of the poor, environmental destruction," said 
Brandt, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for pursuing East-West detente in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know the tasks in our country are not minor," he said of Bonn's costly 
commitment to turn eastern Germany into a mirror of affluent western Germany. 
"But we cannot fail to show solidarity with the wretched of this earth." 
</P>
<P>
Elected democratic representatives from all Germany last sat together in 
Berlin's Reichstag, the historic seat of German legislatures, in December, 
1932. Adolf Hitler's Nazis took control the next year. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers will return to the seat of government in Bonn for future 
meetings. They eventually will decide whether to move permanently to Berlin, 
the unified nation's symbolic capital. 
</P>
<P>
The 662 deputies elected in Germany's general elections Dec. 2 included 150 
representing the former East Germany, which dissolved into Bonn's Federal 
Republic on Oct. 3.

More than 40 people were killed and 14 injured when a train crashed into a bus

crossing about 20 miles north of the port of Kaohsiung, was apparently caused 
by the failure of a safety barrier to come down.

MAN ARRESTED IN RAMPAGE AT BASE WANTED TO KILL BUSH

A man who went on a shooting rampage at a military base here said Thursday he 
wanted to kill President Bush and send planes to Saudi Arabia because he 
disagreed with Bush's actions against Iraq, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Craig Anderson, 41, arrested Wednesday night after a high-speed chase 
outside Moffett Naval Air Station, told FBI agent John Zent about his plans 
during an interview at Stanford Medical Center, the agency said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The man from Mountain View, who is being held for psychiatric evaluation, 
waived his right to an attorney, the FBI said. In an affidavit, Zent said 
Anderson told him he planned to take over the base "and dispatch planes to 
Saudi Arabia as he disagreed with President Bush's present actions concerning 
Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson also told Zent "his intention (was) to kill President Bush," but the 
complaint did not specify why. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson crashed his vehicle through the base front gate Wednesday night, 
speeding past sentries and firing as many as 16 rifle shots, including some at 
military police, the FBI said. No one was hurt. He faces seven charges, 
including assault with intent to commit murder, kidnaping and threatening the 
President.

MISTRIAL RULED IN ASSAULT ON JOHN WAYNE'S DAUGHTER

<P>
A mistrial was declared Thursday in the case of Dr. Thomas A. Gionis, a 
physician charged with ordering an assault on his ex-wife, the daughter of the 
late actor John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher J. Evans said that because nine of the 12 jurors voted for 
conviction, he intends to prosecute Gionis again. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows I am still innocent," Gionis said after the deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend Gionis wanted to "teach a lesson" to Aissa Wayne on the eve 
of a 1988 custody trial over their two-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The three holdout jurors said the prosecution's case was damaged when a 
district attorney's investigator admitted on the witness stand that "it looked 
like" he perjured himself in testimony about Gionis' whereabouts before the 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
Sharron Cooley of Anaheim, one of the holdouts, said, "had (his) information 
been accurate, it would have been a very easy case." 
</P>
<P>
One of the jurors who voted to convict blamed the mistrial on "just a couple of 
opinionated people" who "threw reason out the window." The juror declined to 
give her name.

Marilyn Monroe's marriage contract to American playwright Arthur Miller fetched 
more than $14,000 on Thursday, Christie's auctioneers said. 
</P>
<P>
The ketubah, a Jewish wedding contract dated July 1, 1956, was witnessed in New 
York by Lee Strasberg, founder of New York's Actors' Studio. Monroe converted 
to Judaism for the marriage, Miller's second and her third. They divorced in 
1961, the year before her death at 35.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 500 EXPECTED IN CHARITY TAVERN RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 500 participants are expected Sunday for the 13th Annual Bar-to-Bar 
Christmas Charity Run in San Pedro, a community tradition in which joggers 
dressed in holiday costumes raise donations at local taverns for the harbor 
area's disabled youth. 
</P>
<P>
The event, beginning at 8:30 a.m., spans four miles and costs $5 to enter. 
</P>
<P>
Organizer Carmen Trutanich said this year's goal is to raise at least $5,000 in 
donations for four local organizations, including the Harbor Area Retarded 
Children's Foundation. In addition, he said, canned goods and other food will 
be collected for Toberman Settlement House. 
</P>
<P>
The event began on Christmas Eve, 1977, when Trutanich and five other joggers 
ran through San Pedro singing Christmas carols. The following year, with more 
runners, the group stopped off at local taverns to sing carols and collect 
money. Over the years, the event has drawn hundreds of runners -- dressed as 
Santas, elves and even Christmas trees -- and raised thousands of dollars in 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
The run will begin at the intersection of 9th Street and Grand Avenue and will 
be followed by a holiday dance party at the same location.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STREET CLOSURE WILL BE STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Torrance city officials have hired a consultant to complete an environmental 
impact report on the proposed closure of Via Valmonte at Torrance's border with 
Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Envicom Corp. will be paid nearly $30,000 to complete the report over the next 
five months, said Jeffery Gibson, senior principal planner for Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of narrow, winding Via Valmonte have complained for years that 
commuters cutting through to and from the Palos Verdes Peninsula have turned 
their street into a speedway because it is the only residential route that 
crosses the border between the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
Similar streets in the neighborhood, which is west of Hawthorne Boulevard, end 
in cul-de-sacs, forcing drivers to use either Hawthorne Boulevard or Crenshaw 
Boulevard for access to the rest of the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members ultimately will vote on whether to close the street once 
the environmental report has been completed.

SKIERS SUSCEPTIBLE TO MULTITUDE OF INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Doctors who treat athletes say they see more injuries to skiers than to 
participants of other popular recreation sports, with the exception of 
skateboarding. Cycling has spills, tennis has problem elbows and softball has 
beer guts, but skiing is multifaceted in its danger. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do skiers routinely fall -- often at breakneck speeds -- and sometimes 
run into trees, they also put unnatural stress on their knees. 
</P>
<P>
"I see sprained knees day to day in the ski season," said Dr. Frank Bredice, a 
Van Nuys chiropractor. 
</P>
<P>
With modern-day boots virtually eliminating ankle injuries, Bredice said, a 
sprained knee is now the hors de combat for skiers. Unfortunately, a knee 
injury is usually a lot more serious than a broken or sprained ankle: It often 
requires surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The torquing involved in skiing puts extreme strain on the medial and lateral 
collateral ligaments, Bredice said. 
</P>
<P>
Bredice also sees a "tremendous amount" of swollen knees, a condition that can 
be avoided. It happens when the quadriceps are overworked and go into spasm. 
Bredice said he is "amazed" by how many people ski without first strengthening 
their quads. 
</P>
<P>
He recommends doing wall squats with knees bent as "the bare minimum." To best 
prepare for the slopes "you should get to a gym and do complete, whole-body 
exercises emphasizing legs and abdomens." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, no amount of exercise will counter the effects of an accident, of 
which falling is the most prevalent. Falling, even at moderate speeds, can 
cause shoulder injuries, usually because the skier tries to brace himself with 
an extended arm and winds up separating his acromion-clavicular joint. 
</P>
<P>
Head injuries are also a byproduct of a fall. "I see a lot of concussions," 
Bredice said.

DANIELS AT THE CENTER OF NEW UNLV INQUIRY; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: NCAA SAYS FORMER LAS VEGAS RECRUITER BECAME PLAYER'S GUARDIAN AND 
FUNNELED PERQUISITES TO HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANNY ROBBINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The NCAA has charged the University of Nevada Las Vegas basketball program with 
violating numerous NCAA rules and showing a lack of institutional control in 
its recruitment of former New York high school basketball star Lloyd Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
The charges are described in a letter of official inquiry from the NCAA that 
was received by the university Tuesday and made public Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 43-page document was released by the University of Nevada system general 
counsel's office in Reno with all names deleted. 
</P>
<P>
The school has 60 days to respond to the letter, the result of a preliminary 
inquiry initiated by the NCAA in October 1987. The NCAA Committee on 
Infractions will then conduct a hearing and determine the validity of the 
charges and assess a penalty, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Because most infractions cases require an additional month of pre-hearing 
meetings between NCAA enforcement representatives and school officials after 
the school has responded to the official letter of inquiry, the Daniels case 
apparently will not have an impact this season on the Rebels, the defending 
national champions. 
</P>
<P>
However, the case's repercussions could be felt at UNLV far into the future. 
</P>
<P>
The infractions committee has already barred the Rebels from postseason 
competition and live television appearances during the 1991-92 season, the 
final penalty stemming from the infractions case that caused UNLV Coach Jerry 
Tarkanian to take the NCAA to court 13 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
If the committee decides to impose similar penalties in the Daniels case, the 
sanctions would apply to the 1992-93 season or beyond. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Daniels' recruitment, the NCAA charged UNLV with exercising a 
lack of institutional control over the basketball program in the administering 
of scholarship funds and bills incurred by players at hotels during trips. 
</P>
<P>
The infractions committee has generally considered institutional control 
violations to be major in scope, according to Chuck Smrt, an assistant director 
of enforcement for the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV President Robert Maxson was out of town Thursday and could not be reached 
for comment, according to his office. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Associated Press quoted him as saying Wednesday: "When you find 
out you've made mistakes, you do whatever you have to do to correct them. We're 
very anxious to get this cleared up and get the slate clean." 
</P>
<P>
Maxson has instructed all university employees not to comment on the 
allegations, said Joe Hawk, the school's sports information director. 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian has referred all inquiries to his attorney, Chuck Thompson of Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson has said that Tarkanian is not named in any "major allegations." 
Thompson has also expressed anger at the charges, saying: "I know for a fact 
some of the things in there are not true and not supportable." 
</P>
<P>
Although names and most identifying characteristics were deleted from the 
version of the letter released to the public, the bulk of the allegations, 
grouped in 29 areas, match those outlined in a series of stories in Newsday 
during March 1987 describing Daniels' dealings with the school and identifying 
many of the people involved. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that Daniels, a 6-foot-8 swingman who was considered one 
of the best players to come out of New York, received a variety of special 
privileges -- including cash, a car and a motorcycle -- from UNLV coaches, 
boosters and other representatives of the school while attempting to become 
eligible to play for the Rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, who signed a letter of intent to play at UNLV in April 1986 despite 
failing to complete the 11th grade at Andrew Jackson High in Queens, spent the 
fall of '86 at Mt. San Antonio College and enrolled at UNLV as a full-time 
student for the '87 spring semester. He was banned by Tarkanian from playing at 
UNLV, however, after being arrested on drug charges in Las Vegas in February 
'87. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA began a preliminary inquiry into the Daniels affair after an in-house 
investigating committee, appointed by Maxson after the Newsday series, 
concluded that it could neither prove nor disprove the allegations in the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the allegations focused on Mark Warkentien, UNLV's basketball 
recruiting coordinator at the time, who became Daniels' legal guardian in 
October '86. 
</P>
<P>
In its letter of inquiry, the NCAA alleges that UNLV athletic staff members did 
not exercise appropriate institutional control when they allowed Warkentien to 
become Daniels' legal guardian without following up on the advice of the 
Pacific Coast Athletic Assn. -- now the Big West Conference -- office to seek 
an official interpretation from the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the NCAA alleges Warkentien violated NCAA rules in becoming 
Daniels' legal guardian, a relationship that, according to the letter, allowed 
Warkentien to pay numerous improper living, travel and educational expenses for 
Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
Among the improper benefits provided Daniels by Warkentien, the NCAA alleges, 
are a motor scooter, a motorcycle, a used car, clothing and a cash allowance. 
</P>
<P>
Although no longer coaching, Warkentien remains a member of the UNLV athletic 
department staff. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA also alleges that, in the summer of 1986, Daniels was improperly 
employed by UNLV booster Sig Rogich, owner of a Las Vegas advertising firm, and 
allowed to use a Dodge Aries leased by Rogich's firm during both working and 
non-working hours. 
</P>
<P>
A former UNLV regent, Rogich served as advertising director for George Bush's 
1988 Presidential campaign and is currently an assistant to President Bush for 
activities and initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Wednesday through his company, R&amp;R Advertising, 
Rogich acknowledged that he had been named in the charges but maintained that 
his agency had not broken NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
The letter also lists four instances in which UNLV staff members and players 
allegedly provided false and misleading information to NCAA investigators, and 
it describes a scenario in which a UNLV booster allegedly paid a former UNLV 
player $200 in return for signing an affidavit recanting allegations published 
in Newsday and promising to lie to the university's in-house investigating 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
According to a source familiar with the inquiry, who asked not to be 
identified, the owner of a Las Vegas hotel-casino with ties to the UNLV 
basketball program made the $200 offer to former UNLV guard Ricky Collier of 
Riverside, who had described a series of rules violations involving himself and 
Daniels in Newsday.

Collier accepted the money and signed the affidavit, according to the source, 
but later, in dramatic testimony before the school's in-house investigating 
committee, described how he had been pressured to recant the information he had 
given Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has also charged that UNLV altered an NCAA certificate of compliance 
form in 1986 by deleting the name of an athletic department staff member who 
refused to sign the form because of her knowledge of possible rules violations 
in the program. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has reported that in 1986, Brad Rothermel, then UNLV's athletic 
director, altered a compliance form to eliminate the name of Ann Mayo, the 
school's academic adviser for basketball at the time, after Mayo told 
Rothermel's secretary that she could not sign the form because of her knowledge 
of improper activities in the basketball program. Rothermel, who resigned his 
position last June, declined comment Thursday night.

Syracuse University will review a newspaper's allegations of wrongdoing in its 
basketball program, but the initial reaction of school officials Thursday was a 
sigh of relief that the alleged NCAA rules violations were not more serious. 
</P>
<P>
The Syracuse Post-Standard reported that the third-ranked Orangemen might have 
broken dozens of NCAA rules in recent years, such as allowing players to 
receive free merchandise and meals, cut-rate use of cars and cash from 
boosters, including NBA Hall of Fame member Dave Bing. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most serious allegations raised in the newspaper's seven-month 
investigation was that former Orangeman Rodney Walker said a grade was changed 
so he could remain eligible for a Big East game in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Syracuse basketball program has been nationally ranked since March 5, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously some are serious, but most are minor," Robert Hill, university 
director of community relations, said of the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The university is neither confirming nor denying the allegations at this point, 
Hill added. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said the university has sent the NCAA a copy of the Post-Standard report. 
He said the stories will be analyzed and the school will consult with the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
Also, in College Station, Tex., Texas A&amp;M has notified the NCAA that 
violations have occurred involving the transfer of a Syracuse basketball 
player. 
</P>
<P>
Alleged violations became public when recruit Tony Scott told the Post-Standard 
that a New York talent scout had arranged his transfer from Syracuse to Texas 
A&amp;M. The newspaper also quoted Scott as saying the university paid for part 
of his father's air fare and permitted the talent scout to fly on its plane.

Bob Hill inherited his second NBA coaching job on Thursday when the Indiana 
Pacers fired Dick Versace after putting together a 9-16 record, 1-11 on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
Versace was in the final year of a three-year contract, and team president 
Donnie Walsh said it was time for a change. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said he decided to replace Versace after a 114-112 overtime loss to the 
Washington Bullets on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason for the change is we don't feel the team is going in the right 
direction," Walsh said. "We had some problems going back to last year. We felt 
these problems could be resolved but, based on the first month-and-a-half of 
the season, they weren't getting resolved." 
</P>
<P>
Hill, a Pacers' assistant, was an assistant coach with the New York Knicks who 
was named interim coach when Hubie Brown was fired during the 1986-87 season. 
Hill was passed over by the Knicks in favor of Rick Pitino the next season. 
</P>
<P>
Versace is the second NBA coach fired this season. The Knicks replaced Stu 
Jackson with John MacLeod after 15 games.

RAY GIVEN RELEASE BY ANGELS, SIGNS TO PLAY IN JAPAN 
</P>

<P>
Veteran infielder Johnny Ray, who had asked to be traded or released by the 
Angels at the end of last season, was given his release Thursday and signed a 
two-year contract with the Yakult Swallows of the Japanese League. 
</P>
<P>
Ray, 33, was under contract to the Angels for 1991 at $1.4 million, but the 
club will no longer be obligated, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The terms of his contract with the Swallows were not announced. 
</P>
<P>
Ray, who batted .277 in 105 games and missed more than three weeks in midsummer 
with a strained shoulder, said he believed he had fallen into disfavor with 
Manager Doug Rader. 
</P>
<P>
His ability to cover ground at second base seemed to come into question, and it 
was clear when the Angels acquired second baseman Luis Sojo from the Toronto 
Blue Jays in a December trade that Ray was no longer a factor at the position. 
The Angels, currently trying to invest in free-agent third baseman Gary Gaetti, 
were obviously seeking a way out of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
The team secured protection at second base Wednesday with the re-signing of 
free-agent infielder Donnie Hill. ROSS NEWHAN

$150,000 more a season than the National League's most valuable player, Barry 
Bonds, made with the Pirates last season. Slaught hit .300 in 84 games with 
four home runs and 29 runs batted in while platooning with Mike LaValliere.

HONORS FOR THE UNSUNG HEROES OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The people who packed the ballroom of the Park Plaza hotel got to see Joan 
Baez, Peter Gabriel, Bonnie Raitt and Jackson Browne. They heard Kerry Kennedy 
Cuomo quote her father, the late Robert F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
But they had come not for celebrities but for Akram Mayi, Sha'Wan Jabarin and 
David Moya -- men few Americans have heard of. The three were honored by Reebok 
International for fighting on the front lines of the human rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
Mayi, 29, works on behalf of thousands of fellow Kurds held in Turkish 
detention camps; Jabarin, 30, is a Palestinian human rights worker on the West 
Bank, and Moya, 24, has advocated reforms in Cuba since he was in high school. 
</P>
<P>
For three years, Reebok has recognized young people who, "against great odds," 
significantly raised awareness of human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
The company received a record 60 nominations this year. The top winners, who 
were selected by a panel of human rights representatives, each received 
$25,000. Moya was released from prison last month, but was not permitted to 
attend last week's awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Many Westerners may have been surprised when Iraq invaded Kuwait. But not Akram 
Mayi and the 25 million other Kurds worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing of what Saddam Hussein did in Kuwait could surprise us," said Mayi, 
named for May, his family's native town in Kurdistan, a mountainous region in 
northern Iraq that includes border regions of the Soviet Union, Iran, Syria and 
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
"For many years we are talking about Saddam Hussein -- what he did, how he 
killed thousands of people daily, burned Kurdistan, destroyed villages, bombed 
us with chemicals," Mayi said. "But no one listened. No one believed." 
</P>
<P>
Mayi was born in Baghdad in 1961, two months before the people of Kurdistan 
started a rebellion against Iraq. As a child, Mayi often returned to his 
family's village, and while studying agriculture at the state-run university in 
Baghdad, determined he would "spend all of my life in the villages of 
Kurdistan." 
</P>
<P>
But "before I completed my studies, the Iraqi regime destroyed my village." 
Saddam Hussein viewed the rebellious Kurds as his enemy, Mayi said. "It was the 
aim of his regime to remove the geography of Kurdistan from the map." Between 
4,000 and 4,500 Kurdish villages were bulldozed at the time that his own 
village was destroyed, Mayi said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayi completed his university studies in 1983. He moved to an area in Iraq 
where many of the displaced Kurds had resettled and began teaching agricultural 
techniques to adults, and reading and writing to children. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1988, the Iraqi government used chemical weapons to bomb the remaining 
villages of Kurdistan. In a single day in March, Mayi said, more than 5,000 
civilians were killed and more than 6,000 injured. Additional chemical bombings 
in August of that year killed thousands more. 
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi government effectively declared war on its own people," Mayi said. 
</P>
<P>
A day after the bombing stopped in August, Mayi visited three of the villages 
that had been hit. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw in each village a lot of people who were killed. I saw them as if they 
were sleeping," he said. "I saw all the animals -- the cows, the sheep, the 
goats -- all dead, like stones. I saw the birds. All died. I saw the color of 
the plants, changed from green to dark blue." 
</P>
<P>
After that, Mayi said, many Kurds began trying to escape Iraq, "traveling to 
some places near the eastern border of Turkey." Despite government roadblocks, 
about 80,000-100,000 Kurds reached the Turkish border, "by walking, only by 
walking," Mayi said. 
</P>
<P>
Others, injured by the chemicals, tried to make the journey, but died along the 
way. "Nobody could take them," Mayi said. 
</P>
<P>
Half of those who made it into Turkey were sent to Iran, he said. The 
remainder, including Mayi, were divided into three camps. Mayi, an elected 
official in one camp, calls them concentration camps. 
</P>
<P>
In Mardin camp, nearly 12,000 people live in tents that fail to block the sun 
or the rain, Mayi said. Mayi is a council member in Diyarbakir camp, where from 
25 to 30 people live in each 40-square-meter flat. Mush camp houses its nearly 
5,000 internees in buildings "better than Mardin and worse than Diyarbakir," 
said Mayi, who in his role as a council member acts as a liaison between the 
Kurdish refugees and Turkish officials. 
</P>
<P>
Short and compact, wearing a bright cummerbund and a colorful scarf twisted 
into a turban, Mayi looks older than his 29 years. His large brown eyes seem 
tired, as if they have seen too much. 
</P>
<P>
He said one reason he has not married or had children is that having a family 
might keep him from his pro-Kurdish activities. He has been threatened, beaten 
and isolated, he said. Journalists or government representatives who come to 
interview him must meet with him outside the camp. 
</P>
<P>
Mayi said he was surprised to be allowed to come to the United States, but 
welcomed the opportunity to "explain the situation of my people, and to seek a 
solution for this difficult situation." 
</P>
<P>
Mayi was nominated for his award by the British-based Kurdistan Workers Assn. 
He was featured in a documentary on the Kurds shown on the BBC, and worked with 
a British journalist, Sheri Laizer, on her recent book "Into Kurdistan: 
Frontiers Under Fire." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the assault on Kuwait, "all the world is against Saddam Hussein," 
Mayi said. But "daily in Kurdistan, hundreds were killed, and no one was asking 
about the Kurdistanis." 
</P>
<P>
His cause is for his people, Mayi said, but also for himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I am Kurdish," he said. "But I have no country. I have no village. I 
have left everything behind me, and I have no place in the world." 
</P>
<P>
The first glimpse Sha'Wan Jabarin had of his baby son came in a newspaper 
photograph smuggled into his Israeli jail early this year. The picture showed 
former President Jimmy Carter holding the 4-month-old child. The baby's name 
was Muntasser, meaning "victorious." 
</P>
<P>
Arrested a month before Muntasser's birth, Jabarin had not been allowed a 
snapshot of his son. In his 11 months of detention, he said he received only 
two of the 25 letters his wife sent him. 
</P>
<P>
"The administration of the detention center was very keen on ensuring that the 
solitary nature of the detention be complied with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor was Jabarin, permitted an explanation for his arrest. Speaking through an 
interpreter, he said, "As you know I am an administrative detainee, which means 
they don't have to have a reason, let alone an explanation." Because there is 
no official explanation, only an order of detention, and no official charges or 
trial, "that exposes everyone to the risk," Jabarin said. 
</P>
<P>
By "everyone," Jabarin means fellow members of Al-Haq, the West Bank human 
rights organization that is an affiliate of the International Commission of 
Jurists, and its sympathizers. As a field worker for Al-Haq, his job is to 
gather and report accounts of human rights violations from Palestinian victims 
and eyewitnesses. 
</P>
<P>
It was such an incident that brought Jabarin into Al-Haq three years ago. 
Jabarin was watching a demonstration on the West Bank led by young Palestinian 
girls. He said he saw an Israeli settler shoot and kill one of the girls. "From 
150 feet away, he took a pistol and shot her." 
</P>
<P>
On his own, Jabarin reported the shooting to authorities. An Israeli military 
hearing later vindicated the settler. But even with that result, Jabarin said, 
"The point is that this account is unique in the Occupied Territories because 
we are not used to the process of law." 
</P>
<P>
Jabarin said his activities brought him to the attention of Israeli 
authorities. He was stopped at a roadblock in March, 1988, arrested and placed 
in administrative detention for nine months. While in custody, he said he 
helped report to the New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights the 
circumstances surrounding the shootings of two other Palestinian detainees. 
</P>
<P>
His subsequent arrest, in October, 1989, came when Israeli agents showed up at 
his home in the West Bank. Jabarin said he was so severely beaten on that 
occasion that he required hospitalization. He was eventually transferred to the 
Ketsyot Prison in the Negev Desert, from which he was released last month. 
</P>
<P>
Jabarin is tall and bearded, with a deep scar that slices down one side of his 
face. He speaks evenly, almost dispassionately of the conditions in his 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to assume that Americans do not really know what is going on in 
the Occupied Territories," Jabarin said. "If I assume that the American people 
do know what is going on and they don't do what they are supposed to do, then 
the American people must be a kind of aggressive, evil people. I have to assume 
that they don't know, otherwise they would do something." 
</P>
<P>
Jabarin continued, "I'm certain that even inside Israel itself, some people 
don't really know the details or the extent of the kind of behavior the 
soldiers exhibit, or the intelligence officers." 
</P>
<P>
For Jabarin, "the strength of my conviction really comes from the strength of 
the righteousness of the cause." 
</P>
<P>
He is seeking international protection for the residents of the Gaza Strip, 
and, he said, "support in the form of a voice, a true voice, that would rise up 
and demand the application of laws." Jabarin gave a thin smile. "That is all we 
ask." 
</P>
<P>
Jabarin was nominated for the Reebok prize jointly by an officer of the Ford 
Foundation in Cairo, by the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, by a professor 
at Brooklyn College and by the Carter Center of Emory University. 
</P>
<P>
"President Carter had become involved in helping to free Sha'Wan," Susan Casey, 
a human rights program associate at the Carter Center, said. "President Carter 
made appeals on his behalf," and while in the Middle East, met with Jabarin's 
wife, Lamya. 
</P>
<P>
Jabarin said that during his stay in the United States, he would meet with 
groups of Palestinians in this country, and also with representatives of the 
Jewish community. He said that despite the beatings and the detentions he 
remains hopeful, "and expecting that the humanistic conscience of the world 
will really wake up." 
</P>
<P>
As he stood to leave for a day's worth of appointments, Jabarin hoisted his 
sleeping child onto his shoulder. His arms wrapped around the baby in a gesture 
of love and protection. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we do it," he said, and gazed at Muntasser. "For them."

Last Sunday Haitians went to the polls in their first free elections and named 
as president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. During Haiti's last attempt at democratic 
elections in 1987, more than 34 people died and voting was canceled. This time 
there was some violence and a woman was killed during a post-election 
celebration, but overall it was relatively peaceful. During the election, 
several thousand people from around the world and from different walks of life 
went to Haiti as election observers. Huell Howser, producer/host of "Videolog" 
on KCET-TV, was one of the observers. He filed this report for The Times.

But once I turned the corner in this slum of Port-au-Prince, what I saw was 
worth it: Lines of Haitians voting for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
This whole adventure started last week with a phone call from Rep. David Dreier 
(R-La Verne), who asked if I'd like to be part of an international observer 
delegation for the upcoming Haitian elections. I didn't know how they were 
picked, but I remembered seeing election observers before on the news. I also 
was up enough on world events to know that Haiti has had more than its share of 
problems over the years -- especially when it comes to politics. But, I felt 
honored to have been asked, and instinctively said yes. Two days later, I found 
myself on a plane headed for this little Caribbean island republic, not sure 
what was going to happen, but ready for anything. 
</P>
<P>
Well, I didn't have to wait long. When you step off the plane at 
Port-au-Prince, you're stepping into a world -- a Third World -- that literally 
envelopes you with sensuousness. I'm not talking about sipping a cool drink by 
a cool pool. This is no Club Med. 
</P>
<P>
This is a country described as American by geography, French by language and 
African by tradition. A country still largely rural, illiterate and poor. A 
country which lays rightful claim to being the second oldest independent state 
in this hemisphere, but whose political past has been anything but democratic. 
A country that for a long time was ruled absolutely by the dictator Duvalier 
family and their dreaded private army, the Tontons Macoutes. 
</P>
<P>
But now the Haitians wanted to forget about Papa Doc and Baby Doc. They wanted 
free, fair and open elections where the government would be chosen by ballots, 
not bullets. In October, more than 80% of the eligible voters had registered 
and now it was time to put up or shut up. 
</P>
<P>
Would there be violence? Would the mere threat of violence keep people away? 
Would the government even allow the elections to take place? All of these were 
very real questions as we awoke at 4:30 on Election Morning and prepared to 
spread out across the country to observe the unfolding drama. 
</P>
<P>
I had done my homework. I'd attended all the briefings by the U.S. State 
Department officials, the U.S. Embassy officials, the Haitian election 
officials and had read my briefing book from cover to cover. I knew the names 
of the players and the rules of the game. I knew that all the observers had 
been invited by the Haitian government to watch the process and to report any 
irregularities. Our special badges allowed us access to any voting area, but 
only as an observer, not as an actual official. 
</P>
<P>
Being "briefed" was one thing; what I witnessed firsthand was another. 
</P>
<P>
I had been assigned to one of the slums of Port-au-Prince. Even now, it is very 
hard for me to explain how I felt when I first saw the lines. The lines that 
stretched around city blocks and out into the dusty streets. The lines that 
were so tightly packed that you couldn't see daylight through them. Lines 
containing 18-year-olds voting for the first time and 80-year-olds voting for 
the first time. Lines full of people dressed in their Sunday best. Lines that 
formed hours before the polls opened at 6 a.m. Some polling places were as much 
as eight hours late in opening because of a lack of ballot materials. But 
during all those hours, the lines didn't budge. No one left. 
</P>
<P>
Port-au-Prince has some of the worst slums in the world, and on Election Day 
those slums had the longest, straightest lines. Lines filled with people imbued 
with a sense of dignity and determination to stand -- however long -- and be 
counted. You could see it in their eyes. You could feel it. It was like that 
all day, all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
And after they voted and had their thumbs dipped in bright purple ink by 
election officials to show that they had voted, they proudly displayed their 
thumbs as a symbol to family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
During the day I visited at least 40 different polling places and I'm certainly 
not about to report that the election was without its problems. At some places 
there weren't enough ballots. At others, valid voter printout lists were 
incorrect, incomplete or in some cases non-existent. Voting machines are 
nonexistent, and the system was slow -- there was only one voting booth per 
polling place. Some booths were made of two folding cardboard shields. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating matters was the fact that each voter was handed five different 
paper ballots, covering national, regional and local races. Since an 
overwhelming number of voters are illiterate, the ballots were printed with 
symbols for each party, which voters marked with an "X." For example, the 
winning party's symbol was a rooster, and proud voters would crow 
"cock-a-doodle-doo" after putting their ballots in boxes. 
</P>
<P>
From time to time tempers got short and there was some yelling and shouting, 
but it was also obvious from the election judges to the voters that everyone 
was trying their best to cope and to make it all work. 
</P>
<P>
The Haitian peasants like to talk in proverbs, and one of their favorites is 
"Deye mon gen mon" which means, "Behind every mountain is another mountain." 
This election is only the beginning of the new Haitian story. Obviously. there 
are many mountains ahead and many experts will even now tell you the future of 
Haiti is cloudy at best. 
</P>
<P>
But as an "observer," I must report to you that I was blessed to have been in 
the slums of Port-au-Prince on Dec. 16, 1990, as its citizens taught me a new 
respect not only for the human spirit, but for a truly glorious idea called 
democracy.

WHAT'S HOT AND WHAT'S 'NO WAY' WHEN IT'S TIME TO GIVE THAT GIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
As the days count inexorably down to Christmas, here's what professional gift 
consultant Andrea Claster says not to give your nearest and dearest: 
</P>
<P>
* Fruitcake. 
</P>
<P>
* A pet, no matter how cuddly. 
</P>
<P>
* A home appliance -- especially to your wife. 
</P>
<P>
A man should "never, ever" break the last rule, Claster advises in her witty, 
new gift-giving guide, "Modern Living and Modern Giving," unless he's "looking 
for a sneaky way into divorce court." 
</P>
<P>
After nine years in retailing in stores like Bloomingdale's and Alexander 
Julian, in renowned shopping havens like Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive and New 
York City's Trump Tower, Claster knows whereof she speaks. 
</P>
<P>
These days, as president of Claster &amp; Co., a gift advisory company in New 
York, Claster's primary focus is corporate gift-givers. But whether the giver 
is a CEO or someone buying for the in-laws, many people get sweaty palms just 
thinking about gifts, she said in a recent telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Problem-givers resist shopping out of fear," Claster said. "They panic and 
forget to break the issue of what to give away from the emotion of whom they're 
giving to." 
</P>
<P>
Time is also a key issue for people juggling full professional and personal 
lives, she added. Because of that, she encourages telephone and catalogue 
shopping, and she often advises harried clients to use a personal shopping 
service. 
</P>
<P>
While some gifts are absolute no-nos, there are related items that pass muster, 
Claster says. A pair of house slippers is a bad idea for men, who prefer to 
think of themselves as "padding around the jungle barefoot," but socks -- 
particularly the decorative type -- are just fine. 
</P>
<P>
Men buying gifts for women often need help more than anyone, Claster said. 
</P>
<P>
Flowers are always a good gift in an emergency, Claster said. And "why not work 
a piece of jewelry into the arrangement?" she added. 
</P>
<P>
Gifts related to sports -- such as a whistle, a sports watch or a "fanny pack" 
-- are good. 
</P>
<P>
Can't-miss gifts. For the parents of a newborn, chocolate cigars, flowers, a 
silver spoon or a tree planted in the baby's honor "could make you into a 
super-giver," Claster said. Older kids would be thrilled with a long-promised 
trip to the amusement park, with all the cotton candy they can eat. 
</P>
<P>
There even are some can't-miss ideas for the office: A recent Gallup survey of 
business gift-giving found that 40% of the women preferred plants or flowers as 
a business gift, while 46% of the men preferred tickets to an entertainment or 
a sporting event, Claster pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
Really thoughtful gifts for family or friends. For a spouse's birthday, 
breakfast in bed or a night out at the theater. For your grandparents, a 
weekend of sightseeing or a morning spent helping them in the garden, complete 
with a gift of new shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
Never give money, Claster advises her clients. Instead, give children a 
certificate of deposit, which grows with them, or invite adults to dinner at a 
restaurant and give the maitre d' your credit card number beforehand to pay for 
the check. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, it's the thought that counts," Claster said. "Everything comes back 
to that."

STYLE: CONVEYING THE HOLIDAY SPIRIT WITH GAY APPAREL; 
</P>
<P>
DRESSING FOR OCCASION: MUSICAL TIES, LIGHTED SOCKS ARE AVAILABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Don we now our gay apparel: our socks that light up like Christmas trees, our 
musical neckties that play "Jingle Bells," our boxer shorts festooned with 
reindeer. 
</P>
<P>
This season everybody's getting decked out for the holidays. Young or old, male 
or female, people are dressing from head to toe in Yuletide attire. 
</P>
<P>
Even stuffy executives have succumbed to the holiday spirit. The Tie Rack in 
MainPlace, Santa Ana, had one customer swear off musical ties after his started 
playing Christmas carols during an annual meeting with 800 other executives. 
</P>
<P>
"He was sitting in the front row and he couldn't get the thing to shut off," 
says Ziva Adams, manager of the Tie Rack. "They tried dunking the tie in a 
glass of water but that only made it play louder." 
</P>
<P>
With each passing Christmas, the amount of seasonal garb has grown. 
</P>
<P>
At Nordstrom, men can choose from braces adorned with angels and Christmas 
trees, ties with Victorian scenes of old St. Nick, and socks with skiing Santas 
and reindeer. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these novelties do not come cheap -- the suspenders cost $110 and the 
hand-sewn silk ties about $35. Yet shoppers merrily snap them up. 
</P>
<P>
"They're fun and they can be worn year after year," says Lenora Giovino, 
wardrobe consultant for Nordstrom in MainPlace. "Men are just going crazy over 
this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Some bosses wear festive garments to show their employees they're more like 
Santa Claus than Scrooge. 
</P>
<P>
One Nordstrom customer, a company vice president, showed up at his office 
wearing red corduroy pants covered with green Christmas trees, a shirt with 
bright candy cane stripes, suspenders and Santa socks. 
</P>
<P>
"He blew his staff away," Giovino says. "He's a very strait-laced guy." 
</P>
<P>
Giovino's husband has worn his holiday suspenders to two Christmas galas this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been the hit of the party," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Dressing up like elves is a way for people to spread holiday cheer. Yet behind 
the frivolity lies a serious desire on the part of many to find relief from a 
world they might find hard or threatening, Giovino says. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't threatening," she says. "The world is such a hard place. This 
cheers people up." 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom also has battery-operated socks and mittens with light bulbs that 
actually work and colorful hand-knit sweaters for women trimmed with Christmas 
trees, snowmen, reindeer, bows and wreaths. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be fun to wear to a party," says Beth Southern of Villa Park, a 
young woman admiring one of the holiday cardigans. "It's different from your 
ordinary red sweater or green turtleneck. And it's always in style." 
</P>
<P>
Technology has added to the variety of novelty merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
The Sock Market in MainPlace has an array of socks adorned with wreaths, Santas 
and candy canes that light up and play Christmas carols, thanks to tiny 
batteries and microchips. 
</P>
<P>
Computer-generated patterns allow sock and sweater manufacturers to weave 
intricate holiday designs into their garments. Oshkosh has tiny stockings for 
infants and children decorated with detailed pictures of trains, toy soldiers 
and Christmas mice for $4.75. 
</P>
<P>
"Today it's all done on computer, whereas years ago they used to have to do it 
by hand," says Connie Gualiano, manager of The Sock Market. Where handmade 
socks would cost about $35, machine-made ones sell for about $3 to $15. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to colorful graphics, socks are no longer utilitarian but a key fashion 
accessory. 
</P>
<P>
"Customers constantly call us before the holidays to see if we have our 
Christmas hosiery in," Gualiano says. 
</P>
<P>
Men who never strayed from black, brown or navy socks will now sport red and 
green stockings with bells and lights. 
</P>
<P>
For conservative Kris Kringles there are more restrained holiday styles, such 
as black socks with just a sprig of holly along the sides or gray socks with a 
single black-and-white-striped Christmas ornament. 
</P>
<P>
Men and women are buying boxer shorts adorned with Christmas mice, polar bears 
and hippo Santas for $12.99 at the Tie Rack. Young women wear them on the 
outside, while Adams has sold them to businessmen to wear underneath their 
suits. 
</P>
<P>
The Tie Rack also stocks tuneful ties that play "Jingle Bells" and sell for 
$15.99. This season's most popular style shows Santa lounging in a hammock 
under a palm tree. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an excuse to be silly," Adams says. 
</P>
<P>
Kiosks stationed throughout Fashion Island in Newport Beach stock unusual 
seasonal merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
For baby, there are rompers, tennis shoes, sweat shirts and hair bows 
hand-painted with Christmas themes. 
</P>
<P>
Jamaica Me Crazy carries rubber bolos featuring Christmas cacti and Santas, 
with coordinating earrings and bracelets. 
</P>
<P>
The Sporting Life, a women's boutique in Fashion Island, has earrings strewn 
with miniature Christmas lights, necklaces strung with jingle bells and red 
chili peppers, red and green metallic shoelaces and Christmas sweaters with 
snowmen, trees or sequined ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
"We do really well with our novelty. People want to wear something frivolous," 
says Linda Recko, manager of the Sporting Life. 
</P>
<P>
"People's happiest memories are of the holidays. They're trying to recapture 
those simpler, childish times."

HOLIDAYS MEAN INCREASED THEFT AT LOCAL STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The holiday season isn't just for giving. 
</P>
<P>
The period between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day is also a time of greed for 
shoplifters and larcenous employees who traditionally increase their activities 
in Ventura County's retail stores, authorities and store personnel say. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time there's a Christmas season, you're going to have people who will 
shoplift because they want things and can't afford them," Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department Deputy Chris Lathrop said. 
</P>
<P>
But business owners and managers say they are fighting crime with increased 
security forces, new alarm systems and programs encouraging employees to report 
larcenous peers. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities estimated that shoplifting increases by about 35% during the 
holiday season. And while it is difficult to track exact losses, they said they 
believe that employee theft also increases. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, employees are believed to be responsible for 70% of the merchandise 
losses, or "shrinkage," suffered each year in the nation's stores, Lathrop 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, U.S. stores lost an estimated $40 billion due to shoplifting and 
employee theft, according to the Small Business Advancement Institute in 
Medford, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Lathrop, who heads the crime prevention bureau in Thousand Oaks, said the urge 
to steal may be fueled if employees believe their store is not treating them 
well. 
</P>
<P>
A frequent scam is to hide a product in the trash, then volunteer to take the 
garbage out. When the goods are outside the store, the employee hides them in 
his car and then returns to work, Lathrop said. 
</P>
<P>
Employees assigned to unpack shipments may under-report the number of items 
that arrive in a package and keep the extras. 
</P>
<P>
They may develop kickback schemes with delivery people or suppliers. And if a 
customer forgets to ask for a receipt, they may pocket cash and never ring up 
the purchase, Lathrop said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, employees have deals with friends whom they allow to purchase goods 
with bad credit cards or stolen checks, said Sgt. Bob Anderson of the Ventura 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he recently cited a top-level manager at JC Penney in the 
Buenaventura Mall on suspicion of stealing hundreds of dollars of clothing over 
many months. The employee allegedly concealed the merchandise inside her purse, 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
"The incidence of theft I think would shock people," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
However, some retailers deny the problem, Lathrop said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 20 employees from the Sheriff's Department managed to shoplift 
$8,000 worth of merchandise in about three hours from The Oaks Mall in Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The department conducted the exercise to impress upon store owners the ease of 
shoplifting. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Lathrop said, he sent out 500 flyers advertising Sheriff's 
Department seminars telling merchants and employees how to cut down on 
merchandise losses. 
</P>
<P>
But only five merchants showed up for the five seminars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is apathy combined with a feeling that the theft isn't happening 
at their store," Lathrop said. 
</P>
<P>
However, shrinkage is critical to a store's viability, especially if the store 
is smaller, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Larger stores often have teams of security personnel who go undercover, 
pretending to browse while actually watching for illicit activity. Many also 
have sophisticated camera systems hidden throughout the store, he said. 
</P>
<P>
JC Penney Co. in the Buenaventura Mall has increased its security force to 
watch for shoplifters during the holiday season, Manager Jim Word said. 
</P>
<P>
He said employee theft probably increases during this time as the store 
supplements its 160 permanent employees with about 40 part-time workers for the 
holiday shopping crunch. 
</P>
<P>
Word said full-time employees, who have profit-sharing plans or get stock as 
part of their retirement packages, watch the newer employees for signs of theft 
because they feel that any losses come out of their earnings. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the Target store on Vineyard Avenue in Oxnard installed a new alarm 
system to combat merchandise loss, store manager Norm Grow said. The alarm goes 
off when merchandise that has not been scanned during checkout is taken through 
a door. 
</P>
<P>
"In a normal holiday season, we would probably see more shrinkage," Grow said. 
"This year, you're seeing less because of the new alarm system." 
</P>
<P>
Four months ago, the Mervyn's department store on Saviers Road in Oxnard 
assigned employees to stand by two entrances to greet every customer in an 
effort to deter thieves who run into a store, grab merchandise and jump into a 
getaway car, said Jason Contreras, a Mervyn's investigator. The only entrance 
to the store not patrolled is the one into the Centerpoint Mall, where security 
guards might easily catch a shoplifter.

FATHER OF SLAIN WOMAN RECALLS TROUBLED PAST; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: HER DEATH DID NOT SURPRISE HER FAMILY. SHE HAD BEEN ARRESTED BEFORE ON 
DRUG AND PROSTITUTION CHARGES.

<P>
The father of a North Hollywood woman whose strangled body was found beside an 
isolated road north of Ojai said Thursday that his daughter recently wrote home 
about someone harassing her and said she had planned to seek a restraining 
order. 
</P>
<P>
But Abdel Chehade, 53, of Riverside County said he could shed little more light 
on the recent death, or life, of his 26-year-old daughter, Najat. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had last seen his daughter, the second of four children, about three 
years ago when she refused to abide by his plan to give up old friends and 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
News of her death did not shock him, he said. "In a way I was surprised, but in 
a way I expected the telephone call sooner or later," Chehade said. 
</P>
<P>
Chehade learned of his daughter's death Wednesday after the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department identified her through fingerprints registered with the 
Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
Najat Chehade's body was discovered about 10:40 a.m. Monday on the side of 
California 33 by a Sheriff's Department employee who was transporting inmates 
to the Rose Valley Work Camp, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Chehade had been strangled with a cord 16 to 17 hours earlier, Sheriff's Lt. 
Joe Harwell said. An autopsy revealed no signs of sexual assault, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
While it is impossible to tell where the woman was killed, there was no sign of 
struggle where the body was found, Harwell said. It appears that her body was 
dumped off the side of the road after dark Sunday night, and whoever dumped it 
probably intended it to roll farther down the embankment, Harwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Further investigation has been stalled because authorities have been unable to 
track down the woman's friends, Sheriff's Sgt. Tom Odle said. They believe that 
she lived in North Hollywood and had a post office box in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities know that she had left a job at a bank in Encino in August after 
she was accused of stealing money. She also had been arrested over prostitution 
and narcotics violations, Odle said. 
</P>
<P>
Najat Chehade left home for the first time at 15, her father said during a 
telephone interview. She came back about four months later, beginning a 
sequence of departures and returns that would last until her father persuaded 
her to relocate to Arizona about four years ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chehade said he believed that the new environment would give her a chance to 
get away from her friends in Los Angeles and straighten out her life. For a 
while, he said, the plan seemed to be working. 
</P>
<P>
But she returned two months later to the Los Angeles area. It was the last time 
he saw her. 
</P>
<P>
Najat Chehade spoke with her mother a few times and wrote home a couple of 
times in the next several years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the last letter, which arrived about three weeks ago, she said someone had 
been bothering her and she would try to get a restraining order. She never 
asked her family for help, her father said. 
</P>
<P>
She gave her parents no home address and no telephone number. She told them 
that she was living in the San Fernando Valley and gave them the number of her 
post office box. 
</P>
<P>
"All she was after was freedom, and she wanted to be by herself," Abdel Chehade 
said.

SHOPPERS SEEK BARGAINS IN DULL RETAIL SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAYS: MANY BUYERS ARE IGNORING BIG-TICKET ITEMS IN FAVOR OF MARKED-DOWN 
TOYS AND CLOTHING IN A 'MOST COMPETITIVE' SITUATION FOR STORES.

For Ventura County retailers, a less-than-glittering Christmas season is 
finally drawing to a close. Although the county's store executives say their 
holiday business hasn't been a bell ringer, most agree that it hasn't been a 
disaster, either. 
</P>
<P>
Some managers are holding out hope for a rush of last-minute buying this 
weekend to raise sales nearer last year's levels. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas 1990, many county retailers say, was the season when customers walked 
past big-ticket items such as refrigerators, sofas and stoves, looking instead 
for markdowns on toys and sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
"People would come in, find an item they liked and say, 'We'll wait for it to 
go on sale,' " said Don Facciano, manager of Sears Roebuck's Oxnard store. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, Facciano said, the season that "was good, but not up to our 
expectations." Like most retailers, he declined to disclose figures. 
</P>
<P>
"The retail environment is the most competitive I've ever seen," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sears offered deep discounts and so-called zero financing on some of 
its higher-priced merchandise, customers tended to ignore many of these deals, 
buying sharply reduced clothing and jewelry instead, he said. On the other 
hand, home electronics, such as TVs and video recorders, have sold well, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Toys R Us store in Ventura, store director Jeff Ferreira said, 
"Consumers are definitely price-conscious. They know how much they want to 
spend and mostly they're sticking to it." 
</P>
<P>
Ferreira said Toys R Us has been most successful with such sale items as 
Nintendo games selling for $19.98 instead of the usual $35 to $50. 
</P>
<P>
"And we've sold hundreds of Super Fast Machines, a racing car set that 
originally listed at $69.99," he said. The current price: $9.98. 
</P>
<P>
Even with these promotions, sales are "a little below last year," Ferreira 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Activity at the JC Penney store in Ventura started to pick up last weekend, 
"but the previous month was disappointing," said store Manager Jim Word. 
</P>
<P>
"People finally decided to buy last weekend," he said. "Maybe it's the cooler 
weather we've been having. That puts people in a holiday frame of mind." 
</P>
<P>
Sales of jackets and sweaters improved at Penney as soon as temperatures 
dropped, Word said. 
</P>
<P>
He said women's clothing is doing particularly well and menswear is "starting 
to come back," but that jewelry is "a little weaker than expected." 
</P>
<P>
He also reported what he called a surprising demand for men's shorts and other 
warm-weather clothing. "I suspect people are buying them as gifts for our 
forces in the Persian Gulf." 
</P>
<P>
Compared to the 1989 Christmas season, "we'll probably come out about even this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Such lackluster results -- meaning sales failed to keep up with inflation -- 
would be in line with many retail analysts' predictions. 
</P>
<P>
In The Oaks Mall in Thousand Oaks, Dave Geiger, manager of Ritz Camera, said 
business this season is running about 10% to 15% below last year's pace. 
</P>
<P>
"Medium-priced cameras, ranging from about $150 to $450, are doing nicely," he 
said, "but more expensive items, such as video cameras, are not moving as well 
as last year." 
</P>
<P>
Sales of the camcorders, which cost about $800 to $1,200, are off about 30%, 
Geiger said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"But I still feel business has been better than some economists predicted. I 
feel we'll come out quite well, if not as strong as last year." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers' widespread concern about prices appears to have benefited the 
county's discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing very well -- better than last year," said Jeff Bick, manager of 
the K mart store in Camarillo. Still, he said shoppers this year "are spending 
more on basic items rather than the seasonal, gifty stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Items that are moving especially well, Bick said, include toys, clothing, TVs 
and toaster ovens. "Nintendo games are doing fairly well, but compact disc 
players are not real hot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People are very value-conscious. They're waiting for sale items. Markdowns are 
very important to them." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Hoxmeier, manager of the Target discount store in Simi Valley, said sales 
are "comparable with last year" despite defense-industry layoffs that have 
affected some residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy," he said. "People are in a good mood. We've had no decrease from 
last Christmas, possibly because we're a discount store and customers are 
extremely price-conscious." 
</P>
<P>
Turtleneck sweaters, exercise outfits and a computer toy called Game Boy that 
sells for $89.99 have been moving especially well, Hoxmeier said. Unlike K 
mart's Bick, he reported strong sales of compact disc players. "They're having 
their first big year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another retailer reporting Christmas business about even with last year's pace 
was Joe Raabe, manager of the Mervyn's store in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
"So far we're very pleased, but. . . .the retail environment is very tough this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa King, manager of two stores in Ventura's Buenaventura Mall -- Judy's, 
which sells medium-priced dresses, and GHQ, which features menswear -- said 
volume is down a few percentage points at both. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been reducing some prices at Judy's by a third, and that helps," she 
said. She added that some shoppers may have avoided the mall because they 
didn't realize that a longstanding renovation project there has been halted 
until after the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
At The Oaks Mall, Gabrielle Smith, manager of the Lanz of California women's 
wear store, said, "It's been pretty slow. We've been successful in moving some 
dresses that were reduced from $180 to $109, but we're definitely below last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
And Vikki Coronado, district manager of Wet Seal, a group of stores that sell 
young women's sportswear, said sales at the chain's units in both Thousand Oaks 
and Oxnard are "a little below last year." 
</P>
<P>
But, she added: "We're doing fair in view of the economy, which has hit 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Sears' Facciano suggested one bright spot that may help retailers this holiday 
season: the calendar. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas falls on a Tuesday this year," he said. "That means we'll have what 
amounts to a three-day weekend for last-minute shopping. We're hoping for a 
dynamite final weekend."

D.A. INVESTIGATES COLLEGE LEADER'S FUND TRANSFERS; 
</P>
<P>
MOORPARK: TRUSTEES HAVE REPRIMANDED THE CAMPUS PRESIDENT FOR SHIFTING $51,000 
TO A PRIVATE FOUNDATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Ventura County district attorney's office began an inquiry Thursday to 
determine if Moorpark College President Stanley L. Bowers committed a crime 
when he transferred $51,000 in public money to a private foundation that bought 
new furniture for the president's office and a country club membership in his 
name. 
</P>
<P>
"There may be absolutely no criminal misconduct involved," Dist. Atty. Michael 
D. Bradbury said. "It may be entirely a civil matter." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Community College District trustees officially reprimanded 
Bowers on Tuesday for transferring the $51,000 in campus bookstore profits to 
the Moorpark College Foundation, and for funneling another $3,152 to the 
college's former alumni association president, Ingrid Ely, to pay for her 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
Both actions appear contrary to state civil law, which requires that bookstore 
profits be spent for the benefit of students, trustees said. Civil violations 
can lead to fines but not imprisonment. Bowers, while accepting the trustees' 
sanction, has insisted that his actions were legal. He could not be reached for 
comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury said he is interested in the Bowers case because it overlaps with his 
office's prosecution of community college Trustee James T. (Tom) Ely and his 
wife, Ingrid. The Elys are awaiting a January trial on conspiracy and 
embezzlement charges stemming from their alleged filing of false travel claims 
with the district. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided we would give this a look in light of the Ely matter, and the fact 
that there is a nexus there," Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
The community college's investigation of bookstore profit transfers began in 
earnest in October after the district's lawyer found that Bowers had exceeded 
his authority in providing the $3,152 to Ingrid Ely for college-related travel. 
Prosecutors allege that Ingrid Ely was paid twice for some of the travel -- by 
Bowers and by the district. Bowers is listed as a witness in the Ely case. 
</P>
<P>
The college trustees have directed Chancellor Barbara A. Derryberry and Bowers 
to work together to get $16,000 in bookstore profits back from the foundation, 
which has raised $1.5 million for the college since 1980. The foundation should 
also document that another $35,000 in bookstore profits were spent to improve 
the campus football stadium as Bowers maintained, the trustees said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Niles, the foundation's executive director, said Thursday that he is nearly 
certain that his board of directors will comply with the district's requests 
when it meets next on Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
"Our sole point in existing is to raise money for the college, and I personally 
don't foresee any problem in being 100% cooperative," Niles said. College 
district trustees "are doing what they think is necessary to close the book on 
this issue, and it's a foregone conclusion that we're going to be as 
cooperative as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Niles said that while the foundation had paid for the president's office 
furniture and for the North Ranch Country Club membership held in Bowers' name, 
there is no way to tell whether bookstore profits were used for them. 
</P>
<P>
Nor could college district officials say for sure that bookstore funds paid for 
the furniture and membership because the bookstore money was deposited into the 
foundation's general account with the rest of its funds. No separate accounting 
was made of how bookstore money was spent, Niles said. 
</P>
<P>
If $35,000 of the bookstore profits were spent on stadium improvements, 
trustees said, it would be a legitimate use of the money since it would benefit 
students. 
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence that Bowers criminally misappropriated bookstore funds, 
trustees have said. Bowers told trustees that bookstore money was not used to 
pay for the country club membership or a $1,500 love seat and sofa for his 
office, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The college president, in a letter to the board, maintained that he used his 
country club privilege for only six meals in two years, plus a graduation 
dinner in 1989. He said he paid personally each time.

IMMIGRANTS OK UNION; LARGEST ACTION IN YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES LABOR WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what was seen as a significant test of organized labor's ability to 
replenish sagging membership by signing up low-wage immigrant workers, 
employees of a large automobile wheel manufacturing company south of Compton 
voted Thursday to affiliate with the International Assn. of Machinists. 
</P>
<P>
The 655-403 vote in favor of union representation at American Racing Equipment 
Inc. was one of the largest union representation elections held in the United 
States this year, and one of the biggest in the Los Angeles area in several 
years, National Labor Relations Board officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the largest manufacturing plant that labor has organized in Los 
Angeles in more than two decades, according to Dave Sickler, the AFL-CIO's 
regional director and one of organized labor's most fervent advocates of 
organizing immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The workers won the right to bargain with their employer on an initial contract 
-- an often contentious process that can take months or years. 
</P>
<P>
American Racing's employees, most of them Mexican immigrants who make about $7 
an hour, staged a wildcat strike last summer to protest what they said were 
unsafe and uncompensated demands for faster production. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day walkout, which ended when management agreed to a wage increase, 
virtually shut down the production of aluminum wheels at the company's main 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime observers of organized labor in Southern California said a wildcat 
strike by a non-union work force at a large plant was highly unusual. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the walkout, the machinists union and Sickler's office assigned 
an unusually large team of eight full-time organizers to solicit worker 
interest in a union campaign. Workers petitioned the National Labor Relations 
Board for an election. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at American Racing Equipment, owned by Toronto-based Noranda Corp., 
declined several requests for comment during the past week. The company 
operates three plants in Rancho Dominguez, a small industrial town. 
</P>
<P>
"There are millions of other workers watching what you've done today who'll 
take strength from this," Sickler told a gathering of American Racing workers 
Thursday night in a union hall that machinists organizers established during 
the organizing campaign. "This is a very historic day." 
</P>
<P>
Labor officials have spent years talking about the need to recruit immigrant 
workers to replace the hundreds of thousands of union members who were lost 
during the 1980s because of plant closures and increased employer hostility to 
unions. However, relatively few intensive efforts have targeted immigrant 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's victory was unusual because unions have had particular trouble 
winning representation elections at large companies. 
</P>
<P>
While unions win representation elections at nearly half of all U.S. companies 
with fewer than 100 workers, they win only about one-third of the time at 
companies with 100 to 500 workers. The reason is often that larger companies 
tend to expend significant resources, hiring anti-union consultants and 
preparing videotapes for employees to watch before the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The average union representation election involves fewer than 50 workers. Labor 
has been organizing fewer than 50,000 new workers each year in the private 
sector, while losing substantially more members because of plant closures and 
layoffs.

PANEL URGES DISTRICTS FOR STREET VENDORS; 
</P>
<P>
PEDDLING: THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT THE GROWING PRACTICE SAYS ARRESTS 
HAVE BEEN INEFFECTIVE. SOME OPPOSITION FROM BUSINESSES IS EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Los Angeles city task force has recommended sweeping changes in laws 
governing street vendors, including the creation of special vending districts 
where hundreds of Latino immigrants and others can legally peddle their wares. 
</P>
<P>
The report, more than a year in the making, is the first comprehensive look at 
street vending in the city. It estimates that there are at least 2,000 vendors 
operating illegally in Los Angeles, mostly in downtown, East Los Angeles, 
Hollywood and Venice. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo said he will bring the report before 
the council today. He said he will ask the city chief administrative officer 
and the Public Works Department to begin studying the cost of implementing the 
report's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is finally coming of age in terms of promoting an active street 
life in different parts of the city," Woo said. "It always struck me as crazy 
that L.A. didn't take advantage of its climate to encourage street vending, 
street musicians and other outdoor activities." 
</P>
<P>
The task force recommends creating vending districts in six communities where 
street-corner sales already are widespread: Pico-Union, Koreatown, MacArthur 
Park, Hollywood, Boyle Heights and downtown near Our Lady Queen of Angels 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
Sidewalk sales of mangoes, tamales, cassette tapes, oranges and other items 
have become the principal source of income for an entire class of impoverished 
Mexican and Central American immigrants over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and immigrant-rights groups estimate that the number of illegal 
street vendors in Los Angeles has doubled in the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
Some neighborhoods have been transformed into sidewalk bazaars reminiscent of 
Latin America, prompting complaints from store owners and community groups. 
Police have responded by arresting the vendors. According to the report, the 
Los Angeles Police Department made 2,074 arrests of vendors in the first six 
months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Illegal street vending is a misdemeanor, punishable by a maximum of 180 days in 
jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The report concludes that "attempting to drive these individuals out of 
business through criminal police enforcement has not proven to be an effective 
means of addressing a growing problem." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the task force -- which included city officials, police, business 
groups and vendors themselves -- recommended new licensing procedures and use 
of city employees to give vendors training in basic business practices. 
</P>
<P>
"The criminal justice system is burdened enough as it is," said Police Capt. 
Greg Berg, a task force member. "Taking police resources and using them for 
enforcement of street vending regulations makes no more sense than having 
uniformed officers enforce building code violations." 
</P>
<P>
The six vending districts proposed by the task force would be located either on 
one city block or at an intersection, such as the corner of Soto Street and 
Brooklyn Avenue in Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Additional vending districts could be created. Applicants would submit 
proposals to the public works commissioners for approval. The number of vendors 
allowed in each special district would be fixed. To prevent overcrowding, 
annual lotteries would be held for permits. 
</P>
<P>
The city task force recommended that outside these districts vendors be allowed 
to peddle their goods in nearly any of the city's commercially zoned areas. 
Only two vendors would be allowed per block. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the vendors are immigrants from Guatemala and El Salvador, and 
immigrant-rights groups praised the report. 
</P>
<P>
"This is finally an attempt by the city of Los Angeles to treat street vending 
as a business regulation problem and not as a criminal justice problem," said 
Madeline Janis, executive director of the Central American Refugee Center. 
</P>
<P>
The task force has held about two dozen meetings since July, 1989. Its 43 
members include representatives of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, the 
California Restaurant Assn., the city Department of Public Works and the Street 
Vendors' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"The street vendors wanted an opportunity to transform what they do into a 
credible small business, rather than an illegal activity," said Gilda Haas, an 
economic development planner and co-chair of the task force. "Other people felt 
like the situation was out of hand, that it was chaotic and that it wasn't fair 
(to established businesses.)" 
</P>
<P>
Haas said one of the more vocal participants in their meetings was Dora Alicia 
Alarcon, a 39-year-old Salvadoran immigrant and founding member of the vendors' 
association. Alarcon sells mangoes at the intersection of Western Avenue and 
Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, earning about $30 a day. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, they didn't understand what we were doing and why," Alarcon said. 
"This society does not accept you as a street vendor. . . . I explained to them 
that in Central America this is how we make an honest living." 
</P>
<P>
Woo said he expects some opposition to the recommendations, especially from 
merchant groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I know that in some parts of the city there has been a history of problems 
caused by the overcrowding of vendors and the competition with merchants," he 
said. "I will be meeting with the council members (representing those areas)." 
</P>
<P>
Estela Lopez of Miracle on Broadway, a downtown merchants group, said she was 
hopeful that the task force recommendations would benefit both street vendors 
and established businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to come up with regulations, conditions and guidelines as well as 
strict enforcement in order to bring an illegal activity into the marketplace," 
said Lopez, who was also a co-chair of the task force. "(The street vendors) 
will have to succeed on the same playing field as established businesses."

REFUGEES POUR OUT HORROR TALES AS INS RECONSIDERS ASYLUM BIDS 
</P>

When Humberto Ortega went to see federal immigration authorities in Los Angeles 
several years ago to apply for political asylum, he decided not to show what he 
considered irrefutable proof of his need to stay here -- a left arm mangled, he 
said, by Guatemalan authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega is still so uncomfortable about his left arm -- crooked and jutting at 
an awkward angle -- that he is hesitant about being photographed. 
</P>
<P>
But he now admits he made a mistake in not emphasizing the maimed limb to 
Immigration and Naturalization Service examiners before they summarily rejected 
his asylum application after he arrived in Southern California in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The one-time university student's story, recited in Spanish, was one of many 
that surfaced Thursday, the day after the U.S. government announced that the 
INS would reconsider an estimated 150,000 requests for political asylum from 
Guatemalans and Salvadorans whose cases had been turned down since 1980. The 
agreement will also allow applications from Salvadorans and Guatemalans who are 
in this country illegally but have never applied for political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of immigrants' rights, who hailed the agreement as an important 
victory for refugees, said they expect a substantial portion of the 350,000 or 
more Salvadorans and Guatemalans in the country illegally to sign up. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Guatemalan) government did this to me," said Ortega, 29, motioning to his 
damaged arm. "I felt like showing off my arm (to the INS). "But I couldn't. I 
couldn't face up to showing my arm. So I just walked out." 
</P>
<P>
Critics have charged that since 1980, INS authorities routinely rejected 
political asylum petitions from thousands of refugees from Guatemala and El 
Salvador because those governments were considered friendly to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega, who fled Guatemala and settled into a cramped apartment in East 
Hollywood, agreed with the critics as he recounted the incident that drove him 
from his country. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just come home with my brother from a meeting where we were discussing 
plans to protest a particular government decision," he recalled. "They barged 
in, hit my brother and then tied my hands up with wire attached to a baseball 
bat. 
</P>
<P>
"They then twisted the bat tighter and tighter. They broke my arm and you see 
how it is now." 
</P>
<P>
Other refugees said that the threat of violence forced them to seek asylum in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Alva Escobar, a 24-year-old activist refugee who appeared at a Los Angeles news 
conference, said her days as a student in her native El Salvador were abruptly 
cut short by the uncertainty that engulfed her war-torn country. 
</P>
<P>
Escobar, a second-year literature student at the National University in San 
Salvador, was active in her student union and spoke out against the government. 
</P>
<P>
"I spoke my mind," she said. "But in my country that can be a crime." 
</P>
<P>
One day when she returned home, two men were waiting for her. They threatened 
her, telling her they knew who she was, what she was doing. They told her she 
had better watch out. 
</P>
<P>
For the next two months, she noticed men following her as she went to school 
and traveled the city in a bus. She spotted them watching her house. 
</P>
<P>
"I started having nightmares," she said. "I could not be calm." 
</P>

Escobar left El Salvador in 1988, making her way to Mexico and then crossing 
the U.S. border illegally. Eventually captured by the INS, she decided to seek 
political asylum because she felt it would be dangerous to return to her 
country. A hearing before an immigration judge came in October, 1988. The judge 
rejected her petition. 
</P>
<P>
"He said that everything I said was a lie . . . that I had created a brilliant 
story, but that he did not believe it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Another refugee at the news conference, Marvin Pinto, 26, a native of 
Guatemala, also said that U.S. authorities did not put much stock in his plea 
for political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government thinks everyone from my country is here for economic 
reasons," Pinto said, "but that's not true. All they have to do is go there and 
see for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Humberto Ortega, who works at odd jobs in Los Angeles, hopes he will eventually 
be able to make his case here in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope one day to have the strength to show what happened to me," he told a 
visitor. "Then, maybe, you can take my picture."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FAMILIES FUND SCHOLARSHIP FROM SLUMLORD 
SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fourteen families who successfully sued over slum conditions in their Los 
Angeles apartment building presented Southwestern University with $25,000 from 
their settlement to fund scholarships for Latino law students. 
</P>
<P>
The families staged a 16-month rent strike and sued landlord Teodora Deogracias 
three years ago over conditions in their MacArthur Park-area building at 685 S. 
Coronado St., tenant leader Estebana Bonnilla said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many apartments were missing windows, had no heat, water or mailboxes," she 
added. "Raw sewage flowed in some apartments and into the street, kids were 
bitten by rats." 
</P>
<P>
As part of the more than $1-million settlement, Deogracias agreed to provide 
$25,000 for scholarships for low-income Latino students at Southwestern 
University School of Law. The scholarships will be presented annually in the 
name of Dino Hirsch, the late tenant organizer who helped the tenants prepare 
their rent strike and suit.

A 25-year-old landscaper was killed Wednesday night after being thrown from a 
car in a broadside collision at Madera Road and Country Club Drive West in Simi 
Valley, authorities said.

COLD TO CONTINUE THROUGH WEEKEND

<P>
The cold snap will continue in Ventura County over the weekend, although winds 
have died down, meteorologists say. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures were expected to dip below freezing Thursday night and in some 
areas plunge into the upper 20s, said meteorologist Steve Burback. 
</P>
<P>
Nighttime temperatures will hover near freezing throughout the weekend, Burback 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Winds that blew up to 40 m.p.h. Wednesday seemed to have lost strength, Burback 
said. Gusts reached 25 m.p.h. Thursday, and Burback forecast light winds for 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the cold snap, the Moorpark area was without power for more 
than two hours Thursday, Southern California Edison officials said. The outage 
began at 1:59 p.m., and power was restored at 4:16 p.m., said Christina 
Bradley, an area manager. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe it was the wind, although we are not sure. But we saw no evidence 
of any other cause," she said. 
</P>
<P>
To escape the cold, about 62 homeless people gathered Thursday evening at the 
National Guard Armory in Oxnard, which was open for the eighth consecutive 
night. On Wednesday night, 64 people sought shelter there. As part of a 
statewide program to use armories to house the homeless during the winter 
months, armory doors open when nighttime temperatures drop to 40 degrees or to 
less than 50 degrees with a 50% chance of rain. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the armory will probably remain open this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 185 people had moved into the two full-time shelters Thursday 
evening. Wednesday, 210 people slept at the Zoe Christian Center and the 
Ventura County Rescue Mission. VIVIAN LOUIE

<P>
Plans for a large shopping center in Moorpark have been approved by the City 
Council under the condition that the developer also builds a $1-million 
community center for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan approved by the City Council Wednesday night, Santa Monica-based 
Urban West Communities will construct a 122,000-square-foot shopping center at 
the southwest corner of Tierra Rejada Road and Mountain Trail Street. 
</P>
<P>
The developer will also build an 8,000-square-foot community center at nearby 
Arroyo Vista Park. 
</P>
<P>
The community center will include meeting rooms and a gymnasium that can also 
be used as a theater, said Tom Zanic, vice president of Urban West. 
</P>
<P>
Zanic said he would meet with city officials in the coming weeks to discuss 
plans for the center. He said he did not know when construction would begin. 
</P>
<P>
The developer probably will break ground in the spring on the shopping center, 
which will be next to Urban West's Mountain Meadows subdivision, Zanic said. He 
said the plan is for the shopping center to open by December, 1991. CARLOS V.

LAPD OFFICER SEEKS JOB PENSION AFTER TESTING HIV POSITIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first case of its kind, a Los Angeles police officer is seeking a 
city-paid stress disability pension because he tested HIV positive after 
arresting a drug suspect who was infected with AIDS and later died of 
complications from the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Alvin LaBostrie, a nine-year member of the Police Department, appeared 
Thursday before the Board of Pension Commissioners asking for a tax-free 
disability pension because of the psychological stress and physical injuries he 
has undergone since he said the man bled on him during the arrest two years ago 
in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The question before the board is not whether LaBostrie has been infected. The 
board must decide whether his problem is directly related to the July, 1988, 
arrest, or if it is linked to his lifestyle outside the job. 
</P>
<P>
The board members, unsure how to proceed with its first AIDS-related case, 
twice were unable to reach a quorum vote on whether LaBostrie's problems were 
job-related. Pointing to his past sexual activity and pending criminal charges 
for writing bad checks, the board invited him to return in two weeks for 
further evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
LaBostrie, appearing with his Bible in one hand and tissues in the other, 
tearfully begged that he not be forced to undergo more medical examinations. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see any more doctors," he said. "Each doctor I go to, no one 
provides any help. Some treat me like I've got leprosy and put their rubber 
gloves on. But no one knows what I'm going through." 
</P>
<P>
LaBostrie is believed to be the first Los Angeles-area law enforcement officer 
infected with the AIDS virus while on the job. If the board determines that he 
was infected in the line of duty, he would be the first Los Angeles-area 
officer to receive a disability pension because of the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
With AIDS cases increasing dramatically here, law enforcement administrators 
say they worry that new incidents are bound to spring up. Just recently, for 
instance, the union that represents county sheriff's deputies began offering 
AIDS insurance for its membership. 
</P>
<P>
LaBostrie, 40, who is divorced with four children, said after the hearing that 
he became infected during a July, 1988, narcotics arrest. He said the suspect 
was bleeding from puncture wounds on his arm left by 15 to 20 needles found 
near the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me he got AIDS shooting drugs in New York," said the officer, a short, 
soft-spoken man with a slight goatee. "He said he owned a clothing store in New 
York and that when the store became successful, he celebrated by shooting 
drugs. Then he came up with AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the man's blood ran onto LaBostrie's right hand, the officer said, 
where he had an open wound from chapped and extremely dry skin. "He was 
bleeding all over the place," the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
In May of 1989, after the man died of AIDS complications, LaBostrie tested 
positive for the HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). 
</P>
<P>
"It was like receiving a death sentence," he said. "I could immediately imagine 
what the guys on Death Row feel like." 
</P>
<P>
His pension application file included a statement from one doctor who was 
"confident" the officer tested HIV positive through his contact with the drug 
suspect. But another medical expert said there was only a "0.4%" chance of a 
person becoming infected that way. 
</P>
<P>
LaBostrie's complete medical files were not made public by the board. 
</P>
<P>
In general, medical experts have agreed that it is relatively rare for a person 
to become infected with AIDS through contaminated blood mingling with a cut in 
the hand. Health care workers, for instance, are given only a 1% chance of 
becoming infected that way. 
</P>
<P>
If it is determined his psychological problems and physical disabilities -- 
fatigue, diarrhea and sore throat -- are not related to his job, he may be 
eligible for a taxable pension worth 30% to 50% of his salary. But if it is 
shown his disability is job connected, he could receive a tax-free pension of 
from 30% to 90% of his salary. 
</P>
<P>
LaBostrie said after the hearing that he had three past episodes of gonorrhea, 
but that those incidents were in the 1970s, long before he became a police 
officer. "It may imply I had sex with many women, but that's not the case in my 
life," LaBostrie said. 
</P>
<P>
LaBostrie declined to discuss the bad check charges, except to say that he has 
been in poor financial shape since September because he cannot work. 
</P>
<P>
Pension board members indicated that they would not be influenced by the check 
charges because LaBostrie applied for the stress pension in February, long 
before the charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he fears his health will worsen and that he will be unable to 
provide for his children if the pension board does not act soon. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite the ups and downs, I liked my work," he said. "Being a police officer 
was in my blood, just like this thing (HIV) that's in me now. Like my job, 
that's the other part of me that's dying."

WEATHER: AS ICY COLD WEATHER GRIPS THE AREA, LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS URGED TO 
KEEP ITS ACCOMMODATIONS OPEN CONTINUOUSLY FOR 60 DAYS. ACTIVISTS CALL IT A 
MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH.

<P>
While cold blustery winds swirled through Los Angeles on Thursday, lines for 
hot meals got longer on Skid Row, the free blankets were gone by midday, and 
downtown shelters were filled. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a group of homeless activists launched a campaign to pressure 
Los Angeles County to keep its emergency shelters for the homeless open 
continuously for 60 days this month and early next year, rather than only on 
the coldest days. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an issue of life and death. The bottom line is people need shelter," 
said John F. Suggs, director of the Los Angeles Countywide Coalition for the 
Homeless, an umbrella organization of homeless advocacy groups. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles has already started keeping its 12 emergency shelters 
continuously open for 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
The county's emergency program goes into effect only when the National Weather 
Service predicts rain, or a nighttime temperature below 40 degrees. And county 
officials say they cannot afford to do more. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of resources," said Dawson Oppenheimer, spokesman for County 
Board of Supervisors Chairman Michael Antonovich. "We are right now facing 
drastic cuts in mental health and health budgets. . . . We are operating to the 
maximum of our capacity." 
</P>
<P>
The homeless coalition's campaign includes an ad to air on local radio stations 
asking the public to call Antonovich and demand 60-day operation of the 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
According to Alan Wilkins, county homeless coordinator, the county uses 
$525,000 in federal funds to provide lodging for about 1,000 people at five 
California National Guard armories, a Salvation Army shelter in Bell, and 
church facilities in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The county does not use any of its own funds. Suggs criticized this practice, 
noting that the city of Los Angeles contributes about $400,000 to its 
$1,032,000 emergency shelter program, with the balance paid with federal funds, 
and Santa Monica is paying more than $200,000 from its general funds for a 
cold-wet weather program. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins also noted that "we just don't have the facilities" to expand, largely 
due to the county's reliance on the armories. According to 3-year-old state 
guidelines, the military facilities can be used only on an emergency basis, 
based on the temperature criteria. National Guard officials also said 60 
continuous days of use could interfere with units preparing to go to the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing the armories, Wilkins estimated, would cost the county program "$1.5 
(million) to $2 million more." 
</P>
<P>
The county shelter program, however, has been in effect countywide for the last 
six days, including Thursday, with an average 600 of the available 1,000 beds 
used, Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Between 700 and 800 people each night this week have been staying at city 
shelters, which are providing 1,042 beds in the downtown area, Hollywood, San 
Pedro, West Los Angeles and Van Nuys, according to Priscilla Ortiz, assistant 
coordinator of the city's cold-wet weather program. 
</P>
<P>
In the Valley, 107 people sought refuge Wednesday night in a shelter at an 
armory in Van Nuys. But starting tonight, the shelter will be in a heated 
airplane hangar at Van Nuys Airport. 
</P>
<P>
According to the county coroner's office, one possible cold-related death 
occurred Dec. 14 when police found the body of an unidentified man, about 60 
years old, outdoors in downtown Los Angeles. An autopsy is pending to determine 
whether natural causes or hypothermia was to blame, spokesman Bob Dambacker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, downtown missions said their beds have been full for months, so the 
cold snap has just "increased the number we turn down," said Raymond McCann of 
the Union Rescue Mission on Main Street. But since the Skid Row mission is a 
pickup and drop-off point for the city's emergency shelter program, about 400 
extra people show up for breakfast, he added, "because they're being dropped 
off here." 
</P>
<P>
Near Olvera Street, several homeless men said they had gone to shelters this 
week because, as Jose Ruiz, an unemployed laborer said, "It's too cold, 
especially in the morning."

A former used-car wholesaler facing extradition from Arizona on charges of 
selling Ventura County dealers vehicles with rolled-back odometers stunned the 
county district attorney's office Thursday when he unexpectedly appeared in 
Superior Court with his attorney, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory W. Larsen, 34, was being held in a Mojave County, Ariz., jail following 
his arrest last week on a fugitive warrant. Extradition proceedings were not 
scheduled until Jan. 11, but Larsen posted bail and came to California of his 
own accord, said Charles R. Roberts, senior attorney in the district attorney's 
major fraud unit. 
</P>
<P>
"He strolled in with his lawyer and placed himself under the jurisdiction of 
the California Superior Court," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County grand jury on Oct. 26 indicted Larsen on 27 counts of grand 
theft stemming from deals his now-defunct La Brea Auto Sales in Los Angeles 
made with five Ventura County used-car dealers in late 1989 and earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
A state Department of Motor Vehicles investigation showed that Larsen was 
buying high-mileage, late-model cars and vans from other wholesalers, rolling 
back their odometer readings by about half and selling them to used-car 
retailers, Roberts said. The practice of reducing the officially logged miles 
from, for example, 80,000 to 40,000, increased Larsen's prices by an average of 
$2,000 per vehicle, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
"The dealers were livid," said Roberts, adding that most of the vehicles were 
previously leased 1987 and 1988 American cars and vans. "They had to either buy 
back the cars they had sold or give big discounts," he said, because the cars' 
true mileage was unknown.

Larsen's lawyer told Judge Frederick A. Jones on Thursday that his client has 
been living in Bullhead City, where he owns a concrete company, Roberts said. 
Larsen was allowed to remain free on the bond he posted in Arizona after being 
ordered to appear in court Jan. 25. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

<P>
Casitas Municipal Water District directors approved a five-year water 
management plan Wednesday that calls for stronger conservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The district board will consider adopting higher rates and water allocations in 
the next several months for its 2,884 customers in western Ventura, Ojai Valley 
and along the coastal Rincon area. 
</P>
<P>
The board declared a water-shortage emergency in April and appealed to all its 
residential, commercial and resale customers to voluntarily cut back water use 
by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Overall consumption dropped by 19% through November. 
</P>
<P>
But, outside the city of Ventura, the district's other customers achieved only 
4% of that reduction, a Casitas spokesman said. THIA BELL

PLANNERS APPROVE 62-LOT SUBDIVISION

<P>
The Fillmore Planning Commission approved a proposal Thursday for a 62-lot 
subdivision on nearly 17 acres south of California 126. The property on River 
Street between Central and Mountain View streets is now an orange grove. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore planning officials said the proposal by InterCal Associates, a local 
firm, is in keeping with the city's General Plan. However, about half of the 
parcel is outside Fillmore's city limits and will have to be annexed to the 
city pending final approval by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Building permits will not be issued until improvements to Fillmore's water 
system are near completion. City planners said Fillmore's third reservoir on 
Foothill Drive is a prerequisite to future growth. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the reservoir began about a month ago and should be finished by July 1, 
officials said. JANET BERGAMO

<P>
Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) is a leading candidate to become 
chairman of the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee, a post being vacated 
by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), according to legislative sources. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman -- whose district includes Sherman Oaks, Topanga and other Santa 
Monica Mountain areas of the western San Fernando Valley -- on Thursday 
acknowledged that he had sought the appointment from Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
Friedman, elected in 1986, has not served as chairman of a major standing 
committee in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"Of what I understand is now available, this is the one I want," Friedman said, 
citing his interest in issues handled by the panel such as worker safety, 
plant-closing notices and employment discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Reese, Brown's press secretary, said "no final decision has been made 
on the labor committee." 
</P>
<P>
Another name legislative sources have mentioned as a possible labor chairman is 
Assemblywoman Teresa P. Hughes (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Reese would not comment on specific candidates. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Hayden announced that he was stepping down from the labor 
committee chairmanship, a post he has held for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
He will accept the chairmanship of a new Assembly Higher Education Committee.

OAK PARK ASKS SANITATION BOARD TO AID CITYHOOD BID; 
</P>
<P>
JORDAN RANCH: THE COMMUNITY TRIES TO SPEED INCORPORATION IN AN EFFORT TO CUT 
OFF SIMI VALLEY'S ANNEXATION PLANS. 
</P>

<P>
Community leaders in unincorporated Oak Park, racing Simi Valley for control 
over development of Bob Hope's neighboring Jordan Ranch, have taken the unusual 
step of asking a sanitation agency to push for incorporation of their community 
instead of doing it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The Triunfo County Sanitation District board Jan. 28 will consider submitting 
an application for cityhood to the county Local Agency Formation Commission -- 
LAFCO -- on behalf of Oak Park, a district official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Approval from the five-member board would set in motion a process that could 
take years to complete, but would be faster than if Oak Park leaders tried to 
do it themselves, said Ron Stark, a sanitation district director and member of 
the Oak Park Municipal Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to expedite the time in which our filing will take place," Stark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Stark said Oak Park is seeking a faster path to cityhood to cut off Simi 
Valley's plans to annex the entertainer's Jordan Ranch, where a development of 
750 residences is planned. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, cityhood supporters must gather signatures from 25% of the 
registered voters in the proposed city to place an incorporation measure on a 
ballot. If approved, LAFCO would then be obliged to begin the incorporation 
process. 
</P>
<P>
But members of the Municipal Advisory Council, an elected body that advises the 
Ventura County Board of Supervisors, two weeks ago postponed such a petition 
drive in favor of placing the request instead before the Triunfo district 
board. 
</P>
<P>
According to county LAFCO guidelines, a sanitation district may also make a 
request on behalf of an unincorporated area, District Manager David R. Burkhart 
said. He cited a similar situation in Los Angeles County, where the Las 
Virgenes Municipal Water District made the request on behalf of the community 
of Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
"They see it as a way to cut through some of that red tape and get to the heart 
of the question," Burkhart said. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO Executive Director Bob Braitman was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
If the sanitation board agrees to submit the application on behalf of Oak Park, 
it would heighten competition for Jordan Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since Simi Valley received approval from LAFCO to submit an application to 
change its planning boundaries, Oak Park officials have tried to find a way to 
speed their incorporation efforts. They fear that if Simi Valley's annexation 
goes through, Oak Park would be left out of any decision to develop Jordan 
Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Residents are concerned about the effect on traffic and schools the Jordan 
Ranch development would have on their community of 10,000.

FOUNDATION IS PLAYING SANTA AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
GIFTS: THE AHMANSON FOUNDATION, CONTINUING A HOLIDAY TRADITION, HAS GIVEN 
ANOTHER PRESENT TO THE COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART. THIS TIME IT'S TWO OIL PAINTINGS 
FROM THE BAROQUE PERIOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With controversies raging over government funding and art prices falling from 
the stratosphere, the art world has had an exceptionally turbulent year. But 
one grand tradition has remained intact: Coming through precisely on schedule, 
the Ahmanson Foundation has presented the Los Angeles County Museum of Art with 
an annual holiday gift. 
</P>
<P>
Two gifts, in fact. One is "A Glory of the Virgin Annunciate With Saints 
Gabriel Archangel, Eusebius, Roch and Sebastian" (circa 1725), a richly 
structured allegorical painting by Italian artist Sebastiano Ricci. The other 
gift is "The Baptism of Christ" (1690), a prime example of French artist 
Antoine Coypel's religious decorations. 
</P>
<P>
The two Baroque oils on canvas, which go on view today, were purchased from a 
London gallery which bought them from private collections, according to Philip 
Conisbee, curator of European paintings and sculpture. As a matter of policy, 
the museum does not disclose prices of acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
"A Glory of the Virgin Annunciate" and "The Baptism of Christ" were painted by 
artists of decidedly different sensibilities, working in separate countries 
about 35 years apart, but the paintings are a logically paired gift. Both were 
made in conjunction with commissioned altarpieces and they are organized as 
arch- or wreath-like compositions, with figures swarming around a central area 
of light. 
</P>
<P>
Ricci (1659-1734), the better known artist, is a Venetian decorative painter 
who distilled the grand manner of Veronese and Correggio in High Baroque style. 
He created "A Glory of the Virgin Annunciate" as a 44x25-inch model for a 
17-foot altarpiece at St. Hubert's Chapel in the Venaria Reale, a royal hunting 
palace near Turin. 
</P>
<P>
Ricci, who worked in London, Paris and Vienna as well as Venice, painted the 
model in his Venice studio and sent it to Turin for approval, Conisbee said. 
The artist also executed the larger altarpiece in Venice and probably kept the 
model there, though little is known of its provenance. 
</P>
<P>
The extraordinarily complex composition portrays the saints as the largest and 
most compelling of a host of characters that are intermingled in a sweeping 
arch. The saints anchor the canvas, while a bevy of cupids surrounding the 
virgin rise in an arc of clouds above their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel, a winged messenger of God who hovers in the center of the painting, 
mediates between the earthbound saints and the heavenly scene. Eusebius is 
depicted as a man of learning, wearing a bishop's robe and holding a book. 
Roch, who protects the faithful from disease, exposes a spot of the black 
plague on one leg. Sebastian, who also wards off pestilence, is pierced with an 
arrow and tied to a column. Conceived as a sketch (however intricate) for a 
more fully realized work, the model is graced with lively brush work and an air 
of spontaneity. Bright flashes of pigment bring the saintly figures to life, 
while the delicately colored and loosely brushed angels seem to float in an 
ethereal space. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to Ricci's relatively dark, masterfully sketchy work, Coypel's "The 
Baptism of Christ" is all sweetness, light and refinement. Rosy-faced cherubs 
fan out from a beatific face of God and form a ring around a shimmering dove, 
which represents the holy ghost. Beneath this glowing centerpiece is a rustic 
baptismal scene, in which a ragged, muscular St. John scoops up water from the 
Jordan River in a seashell and pours it over the head of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
Coypel made "The Baptism of Christ" as a replica of an altarpiece commissioned 
for the Church of St. Riquier in Picardy, Conisbee said. Lacking reproductions, 
17th-Century artists occasionally made faithful copies of special projects for 
themselves. The fact that Coypel replicated the altarpiece and personally made 
an engraving of it indicates that he was proud of his work, the curator said. 
Coypel's personal version of the painting was passed on to his son, artist 
Charles-Antoine Coypel, and then to La Live de Jully's collection of French 
art. The painting later disappeared into private collections and only recently 
surfaced in London, Conisbee said. 
</P>
<P>
Coypel was a member of a distinguished family of French artists. His father, 
Noel Coypel was director of the French Academy in Rome, where he brought up his 
son. Antoine Coypel absorbed the influence of the Italian Baroque, as well as 
that of Flemish master Peter Paul Rubens, but in sweetly sentimental religious 
pictures such as "The Baptism of Christ" his work appears typically French. 
</P>
<P>
Coypel (1661-1722) was a prominent figure in his day, winning commissions such 
as the ceiling decoration for the chapel of Versailles, but examples of his 
work are rare in America. Recent research on 17th- and 18th-Century French 
artists, including a recently published monograph on Coypel, has sparked new 
interest in his work, Conisbee said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Baptism of Christ" is the first late 17th-Century French picture to join 
the museum's collection. It will be displayed in the 17th-Century gallery, 
along with two earlier Ahmanson gifts, Georges de La Tour's "Magdalen With the 
Smoking Flame" and Philippe de Champaigne's "St. Augustine," museum director 
Earl A. Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
Ricci's painting will take a prominent place in the 18th-Century gallery among 
Venetian works by such artists as Canaletto, Tiepolo, Gaspare Diziani and 
Giovanni Battista Piassetta. The Ahmanson Foundation has provided acquisition 
funds to help the museum build its Old Master painting collection for several 
years. "We still have many holes in our collection, but good things continue to 
come on the market," Conisbee said. "The $10- and $20-million pictures are out 
of our range, and as prices have risen we have had to look harder for good 
pieces that we can afford." The search goes on throughout each year, but 
results are unpredictable. "I have drawn up a list of things we want, but then 
something wonderful appears that is not on the list," he said.

IVAN REITMAN, 'KINDERGARTEN COP'S' TOP SERGEANT; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: THE DIRECTOR OF 'GHOSTBUSTERS' AND 'TWINS' FACES HIS BIGGEST CHALLENGE 
YET: A ROOM FULL OF TYKES. EVEN ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER WAS COWED.

<P>
In order to preserve his sanity while working with 30 young children on 
"Kindergarten Cop," director Ivan Reitman had to develop rather innovative 
methods of moviemaking. 
</P>
<P>
"After the first day of filming I was in a sweat," Reitman recalled last week 
in an interview in his lush office at Universal. "My shirt was all wet, my 
voice was hoarse and I had this really panicked look in my eyes. So I developed 
the five Reitman rules of filmmaking -- listen, act natural, know your 
character, don't look in the camera and discipline." 
</P>
<P>
Reitman admitted that he had no idea how hard it would be to work with a group 
of children between the ages of 4 and 7. "I had worked with 12- and 
13-year-olds in 'Meatballs' and it worked out fine," he said. "I thought, 'I 
can handle this.' " 
</P>
<P>
But he couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I suddenly realized how little they were," Reitman said. "It was really 
tough." 
</P>
<P>
"Kindergarten Cop" stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as a tough police detective 
forced to go undercover as a kindergarten teacher who ends up falling for his 
young charges. The movie reteams Reitman and Schwarzenegger for the first time 
since their 1988 box-office hit, "Twins." Reitman's seven previous films -- 
including "Meatballs," "Stripes" and the two "Ghostbusters" -- have grossed $3 
billion worldwide, making him the most successful comedy director in history. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the children featured in "Kindergarten Cop" are non-actors from 
Southern California. Reitman and casting director Michael Chinich auditioned 
more than 2,000 children. 
</P>
<P>
"We rented a school nearby and took over a couple of kindergarten classes," 
Reitman said. "We would bring in about 150 kids at a time and we would see them 
in four sets of 35 at a time. They would stand up and introduce themselves and 
say anything they wanted to say." 
</P>
<P>
Each group was videotaped and photographed. Eventually, they narrowed the 2,000 
down to 250 children. Reitman spent days trying lines with the 250 kids. "You 
would say, 'Jason, start over there, walk to the exit while you are walking, 
say this line and after you say this line, go over there and pick up the 
basketball.' " 
</P>
<P>
Reitman laughed. "You tell that to an adult and he may have some trouble with 
it," he said. "If he's an experienced actor he can usually handle it, but say 
that to a 5-year-old and all he can remember is basketball. By the time you 
finish talking and you say 'action,' he runs over and picks up the basketball 
and you have to start all over again." 
</P>
<P>
Schwarzenegger was brought in late during the audition process so he could get 
accustomed to talking with the youngsters. Though a new father, said Reitman, 
Schwarzenegger never had conversations with such small children. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people don't have to," Reitman explained. "I have three kids, so I have 
learned to talk to kids a little bit. I don't condescend to them. So he watched 
to see how I spoke to the class at first and then he started to pick up the 
fact I dealt with them as if they were young adults." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that everyone always tells you never to work with children or 
animals," said Schwarzenegger. "But Ivan felt comfortable with the children. He 
is a family man himself and has taken his kids to kindergarten. By the time I 
got into the play, I felt he was in control of the children and knew exactly 
how to deal with them." 
</P>
<P>
Schwarzenegger admitted he was worried about how he was going to relate to the 
kids. "You read the script and it's a great idea and then all of a sudden the 
dust settles," he said. "That's why I insisted Ivan direct the film. When I 
went in, I was sweating. I felt like the character in the movie. Then it dawned 
on me that physical fitness would be a way to approach them. I asked them to do 
jumping jacks and 100 kids enthusiastically started to do jumping jacks. We 
started exercising and from that point on, I had them totally on my side." 
</P>
<P>
"I think they softened his heart," said Reitman. "He really got into the film." 
</P>
<P>
The 30 children ultimately chosen "made an interesting box together of assorted 
kids. It was mixing and matching. I wanted people coming out of the film to 
feel that this is a real kindergarten class, not just film kids." 
</P>
<P>
Identical twins Joseph and Christian Cousins play the leading child role of 
Dominic. "That was just luck," Reitman said. "It was hard enough to find anyone 
who could approach those lines and in comes this kid -- actually two kids walk 
in, and they were spectacular. I thought, 'Thank God, not only is he good, 
there's two of them!' " 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of shooting in Oregon went smoothy because there were no 
complicated classroom scenes, Reitman said, but things changed quickly when 
they got to the sound stage at Universal. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as they got on the set it was pandemonium," he said. "For some reason, 
as soon as the children see a camera they are like a magnet toward those 
beautiful eyes. The Pledge of Allegiance scene was not a hard scene, but 
because it was a close dolly shot of a long line of the kids, you could just 
see the kids go toward the camera as it went by." 
</P>
<P>
So Reitman would do tricks to get the kids' attention. "I would walk beside the 
camera waving something so they would be distracted, or I was constantly 
talking while the filming was going on, reminding them what their lines were. I 
became a kind of cheerleader." 
</P>
<P>
Though several of the children could read, most were taught their lines by 
their parents. A lot of their dialogue, though, was written by Reitman the day 
of the shooting. The scene in which Schwarzenegger asks the students to explain 
what their fathers do for a living, was just a few lines in the script. "I gave 
some kids lines to say, but half of them were real," he said. "They talked 
about what their real fathers did and they enjoyed that." 
</P>
<P>
Reitman's favorite was 5-year-old Sarah Rose Karr, who plays Emma, a little 
girl who always needs to use the bathroom. "She marched to her own drummer," 
Reitman said with affection. "I quickly learned not to worry about it. If she 
wants to stand, let her stand. If she wants to sit, let her sit. The class 
would be looking one way and she would be whirling about. She was just very 
special." 
</P>
<P>
Though the majority of the parents had never thought of their children as 
actors, Reitman said many showed symptoms of becoming stage parents by the end 
of production. 
</P>
<P>
"They could see if little Sally was in the camera or not," he said. "When they 
found she wasn't, they would say, 'Sally, maybe if you stood a little closer to 
Arnold. . . ."

STOLEN FRENCH ART FOUND IN CUPBOARD

Twenty-eight French masterpieces seized by the Nazis during World War II, 
including paintings by Monet, Renoir and Gauguin, have been found in a cupboard 
at a Berlin museum, a news magazine reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
This week's cover story in L'Express described how the works -- seized from 
private citizens between 1942-44 -- have been locked away since 1972, their 
existence known to only a handful of people. 
</P>
<P>
According to the magazine, the Department of French National Museums learned 
the works existed in 1975, but "was not interested because the works did not 
come from national collections." 
</P>
<P>
"Never did the prestigious department think of consulting its experts or 
glancing through the catalogues of the artists in question," L'Express wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The paintings included Claude Monet's "Route, Effet d'Hiver. Soleil Couchant 
(Road, Effect. Sunset)"; Eugene Delacroix's "Jeune Homme (Young Man)"; Auguste 
Renoir's "Coco Ecrivant (Coco Writing)"; and Paul Gauguin's "La Falaise (The 
Cliff)." They were examined by l'Express reporters who said they were in 
excellent condition. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvie Poujade, a French museum spokeswoman, told the Associated Press her 
department learned of the paintings' existence a month ago, when contacted by 
l'Express reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"We searched our archives and did not find proof that the department had ever 
received a list of works from Berlin," Ms. Poujade said. 
</P>
<P>
Ms. Poujade said that French museums are considered "depositories of state 
property which they are expected to conserve and display in good condition." 
</P>
<P>
"Our role is not to track down art works not considered state property. That's 
the job of other government offices," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine quoted Lothar Brauner, curator at the Nationalgalerie, in formerly 
East Berlin, as saying he received the works on May 19, 1972, from an 
unidentified person claiming to have gotten them from a third party. 
</P>
<P>
A legal document drawn up that day shows that the person wished to hand over 
the paintings "so that they would be properly preserved until being returned to 
their rightful owners." 
</P>
<P>
Brauner said he did not know who the rightful owners were. 
</P>
<P>
According to l'Express, French museum authorities were informed the works were 
in Berlin by the French Foreign Affairs Ministry, itself contacted by East 
German authorities. 
</P>
<P>
L'Express recounted how Brauner and his wife, a restoration expert, locked the 
paintings in a yellow, wooden armoire and equipped it with a pail of water and 
a hydrometer to measure the humidity. From time to time, they would take out 
the paintings and check their condition, the magazine wrote.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: TIME RIPE FOR NEW KCET LABEL . . . INCONSISTENT; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: IF THE STATION THINKS THAT 'SOUTH AFRICA NOW' IS THE ONLY SHOW IT 
AIRS THAT IS OPINIONATED, THEN ITS HEAD IS REALLY BURIED IN THE SAND.

<P>
Three cheers for KCET's decision to renew "South Africa Now," the valuable, 
feisty little series it earlier sought to cancel after charging that the weekly 
half hour was slanted toward the African National Congress (ANC). 
</P>
<P>
Produced by Globalvision, "South Africa Now" has been a public relations 
nightmare for KCET. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously believing its viewers are frightfully confused, however, KCET has 
decided to label the series a "point of view," making "South Africa Now" the 
only program in the KCET schedule given such special consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The station says the series, which has been airing 9 a.m. Sundays, "does not 
consistently meet KCET standards for fairness and balance in news programming." 
</P>
<P>
Then, of course, KCET had to take a stand. The one thing that none of us wants 
is for KCET to compromise its standards. 
</P>
<P>
But wait. If "South Africa Now" doesn't meet KCET standards, then why is the 
station running it? Because it has caved into pressure after facing loud public 
protests over its earlier decision to cancel the series? And if KCET is so 
easily bullied, is it now caving into pressure from the right in announcing 
that the series will subsequently carry a "point of view" tag? 
</P>
<P>
In any event, how about some consistency? This is no time for KCET to be stingy 
with labels. 
</P>
<P>
If "South Africa Now" is a "point of view," then William F. Buckley's "Firing 
Line" and "John McLaughlin's One on One" -- series that KCET runs back to back 
on Saturday afternoons -- are flat-out archconservative polemics. Buckley and 
MacLaughlin would be deeply wounded to learn that KCET thinks they have no 
point of view. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, if the venerable "Wall Street Week" isn't a bastion of conservative 
thinking on fiscal matters, what is? 
</P>
<P>
There's more. If KCET thinks the recent Bill Moyers-reported "Frontline" 
program, "High Crimes and Misdemeanors," lacked a generally liberal point of 
view on the Iran-Contra affair, then it wasn't watching. If it disputes that 
this week's "Frontline" program, "The Spirit of Crazy Horse," was a 
near-unchallenged endorsement of American Indian grievances against the federal 
government, then its head is really buried in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, what are KCET's very own beloved and endlessly recurring Pledge 
Week pitches for operating funds if not a "point of view" consisting of one 
unchallenged standing ovation after another in favor of the programs and 
policies of KCET and PBS? How about a label for them? 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, when word gets around that KCET is running a series that 
doesn't meet its standards, then maybe no one will give. 
</P>
<P>
Arsenio Hall had a point the other night when he was challenged on his show by 
two gay activists who stood in the audience and demanded that he have more gay 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
Which of his guests are gay really isn't any of their business. As a matter of 
fact, the protesters were arguing from ignorance. They had no idea how many of 
Hall's guests have been gay because not every gay person publicly announces his 
or her sexual preference. Was it the opinion of the protesters that only 
out-of-the-closet gays qualify as homosexuals? 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, what a dumb move by them in the first place, as if they would somehow 
be able to bully Hall on his own show and make a point with the public. His 
show is on tape, so if he had ended up looking bad, the entire exchange could 
have been edited out. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, however, the ambushers were ambushed by the ambushee. 
</P>
<P>
They walked right into the whirling propeller, allowing Hall to chew them into 
confetti with a self-servingly sanctimonious tirade that had him coming across 
as a sort of heroic black champion who had been wronged by these two intruding 
sluggos. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, the shouting and carrying on was kept in the show because, no 
matter the source or circumstances, good TV is always good TV. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Vitale is always bad TV. 
</P>
<P>
Awesome, baby! That isn't a mouth between Vitale's nose and chin, it's an 
active volcano, a conduit through which hot, molten, gaseous verbiage is 
ejected onto every telecast he works as No. 1 college basketball analyst for 
ESPN and ABC. His verbosity literally destroys the game. 
</P>
<P>
Vitale's point of view is himself. He takes a back seat to no one in his 
capacity to bury everything he covers with these epic eruptions that are passed 
off as commentary. He does his homework, but somehow twists nearly every piece 
of information he retains into something that comes off as self-serving. 
</P>
<P>
He may be a swell guy in person. But everything about Vitale on the air screams 
Me! Me! Me! He just won't let up. Overbearing? A hammy upstager? Compared to 
Vitale, Howard Cosell is Mr. Peepers, and John Madden -- the CBS pro football 
commentator whose carefully cultivated reputation for uncontrolled loudness has 
earned him millions -- is a barely audible whisper. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of one team versus another when Vitale works a basketball telecast, its 
Vitale versus the game, with him the inevitable winner and viewers the losers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group exhibition of pinhole photography and the handmade cameras used to 
create it will be on display Jan. 31 through March 6 at Orange Coast College's 
Art Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, titled "Oracular Orifices," features works by 13 artists 
dedicated to the distinct signature image of the camera obscura. 
</P>
<P>
The pinhole camera obscura requires neither lens, mirror nor other optical 
components and can be constructed from any "light-tight" container that has a 
singular pinhole aperture made with a pushpin or laser or other device. 
</P>
<P>
OCC photography instructor Peggy Ann Jones, curator of the exhibit, has 
included her own laser-drilled camera and Japanese photographic "O Jizo Sama" 
shrine in the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Renner, author and publisher of the Pinhole Journal and considered a 
"guru" of pinhole photography, will display his underwater pinhole camera and 
the abstract images it produced. 
</P>
<P>
Other artists and photographers featured in the show include Marcus Kaiser, who 
used the Berlin Wall as a pinhole camera, and Belgium-born Dominique Stroobant, 
who is known for his sun tracings and other observations and recordings of 
solar eclipses too bright to scrutinize with the naked eye. 
</P>
<P>
An opening reception is planned for Feb. 2 from noon to 2 p.m. at the OCC Art 
Gallery. Photo artist Jo Babcock will be on hand with his Volkswagen bus a la 
camera obscura titled, "Lens on Wheels." 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the exhibition, Jones will lecture on pinhole photography 
Feb. 22 at 7 p.m. at OCC. She will conduct a workshop at the college on Feb. 23 
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The gallery is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. For more 
information, call the Fine Arts Department at (714) 432-5629 or the Art Gallery 
at (714) 432-5725.

PANEL FINDS NO ANSWERS FOR SLIDE IN COUNTY SAT SCORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A special commission of county educators failed to find a simple explanation 
for the dramatic drop by San Diego County high school students on the 1990 
Scholastic Aptitude Test, known as SAT. 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing county education Supt. Tom Boysen set up the commission in August 
after SAT verbal scores fell from 432 in 1989 to 423 this year, the lowest 
since 1983, when major school improvement efforts first got under way, both 
locally and nationally. 
</P>
<P>
Boysen was particularly bothered by the drop in SAT verbal scores at the same 
time county seniors have been showing strong improvements in reading and essay 
writing as measured by the state's major indicator of educational progress, the 
California Assessment Program (CAP) standardized test. The SAT scores are used 
by colleges as an admissions standard. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, in finding no specific reasons for the apparent contradiction, 
decided to stress the need for continued instructional improvements that will 
benefit students taking both the CAP and SAT tests. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing we could pin down right now to explain the scores," Bill 
Berrier, commission chairman and superintendent of the San Dieguito High School 
District in North County, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"So we say simply that (over the long-run), kids are going to have to study 
harder and need to read more, and need to discuss more of what they read, and 
their reading needs to be of good quality, and they need to have homework 
related to what is being done in class," Berrier said. "And parents and the 
community have a role to play as well." 
</P>
<P>
Berrier and his colleagues noted that the CAP test concentrates on vocabulary 
and reading comprehension, by asking students questions about a reading 
passage, and measures concepts that instructors throughout California consider 
important to teach in state public schools. 
</P>
<P>
The SAT lists its vocabulary questions one after another without reference to 
an excerpt or literary passage, and measures reading comprehension and more 
general verbal knowledge with text materials not necessarily used in a 
classroom setting. 
</P>
<P>
Berrier said that, although all 12th-grade students take the CAP tests, only 
about 40% of the seniors -- those thinking about attending college -- take the 
SAT. 
</P>
<P>
But it is too early to conclude that the particular performance of 
college-bound students, those who take the SAT, is falling at the same time 
that the overall basic academic performance among the general student 
population is increasing, Berrier said. 
</P>
<P>
Berrier's group wants all teachers, not just those in the English department, 
to take a stronger role in developing reading and writing skills. It suggested 
that English teachers develop students' abilities to reason better by 
concentrating on shorter, more difficult texts rather than by superficially 
presenting longer works. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a broad responsibility, and we have to keep working at it," Berrier said, 
while not discounting the improvements that he and other educators believe have 
been made during the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
The commission also recommended that school districts make available to their 
students special short-term SAT preparatory, or "test-wise," courses that help 
students become familiar with a test's format. 
</P>
<P>
"There are advantages to knowing what a test's (form) is going to look like," 
Berrier said. 
</P>
<P>
Because CAP tests are given at several grade levels and measure knowledge that 
is part of state curriculum guides, students are more familiar with its format, 
he said. In addition, the CAP scores are not reported for individual students, 
as are SAT results, but only for schools and districts, so some students may 
not feel as much pressure when taking CAP.

SNOW BLOWS BUSINESS INTO MOUNTAIN TOWN OF JULIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL BEN-ALI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Holding a loosely packed snowball in each hand, 15-year-old Dana Resor swung 
his arms and hurled the cold and wet projectiles. One fell on the head of his 
mother, Sarah, and one on Chris Bones, a family friend visiting from London. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going to have to send a post card back from California: Snowed In," 
Bones laughed. "They're never going to believe it!" 
</P>
<P>
But anyone who was in the mountain town of Julian on Thursday certainly will. 
There, winter arrived a day early, bringing several inches of snow and driving 
winds that pushed the wind-chill factor below zero. 
</P>
<P>
Julian residents and visitors expressed strong feelings about the storm. They 
either loved it or hated it. 
</P>
<P>
Cassidy Eversull, 19, said he drove from Escondido to play in the snow. "Some 
people load up their trucks with snow," he said while inside the Julian Market 
&amp; Deli. "I plan on doing that, then drive back to have snowball fights with 
my friends." 
</P>
<P>
His friend, Jim Hillyard, 18, appeared less prepared for the snow. He walked 
into the market in bright green shorts and sporting a tan gained from five 
months in Florida. "It's all I've got right now," he said, dismissing the chill 
outside and inside the store. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate it," said Kristen Nelms, 22, a market employee. "It does bring in the 
tourists, though." 
</P>
<P>
Business also was booming on the other side of Main Street, a stretch of 
several blocks that makes up Julian's downtown. Customers formed a long line 
inside Mom's Pies, one of several establishments in town specializing in apple 
pies made from local orchards. 
</P>
<P>
Cinnamon and apple aromas filled the large restaurant as several customers held 
their hands over a wood-burning stove. 
</P>
<P>
Mom's averages 300 apple pies a day, but the record is 1,000 in one day, said 
Kathy Goddard, who prepared one of the 14 ready-to-be baked pies that lined 
Mom's window. "It picks up when it snows," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For fun, a driver plowed his dark blue pickup through the 2-foot drift that 
formed a center divider along Main Street. He stopped briefly, as if stuck, but 
then roared forward. 
</P>
<P>
Two women down the street were not so lucky, as a stranger stopped to push 
their car out of the ice. 
</P>
<P>
"We called up here and asked if we needed to bring a change of warm clothing," 
said Mae Hackney, pointing to a small hotel on the strip. 
</P>
<P>
"They said absolutely not," she said, huddling against a fierce wind. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Southern Californians don't know how to drive in the snow, but I'm from 
Missouri," she said. Her companion's car had been stuck 20 minutes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Several visitors said they came to Julian because of the snow, and several said 
they wanted to experience the charm of the small town. 
</P>
<P>
A plaque outside the Julian Market and Deli says the store was built in 1895 
and was originally called Coleman's. You could buy groceries, boots, shovels, 
picks, harness, ladies bustles, coffins or a shot of red eye at Coleman's, 
according to the plaque. 
</P>
<P>
Russ Johnson, 49, seemed unimpressed with the town's quaint atmosphere as well 
as the weather. 
</P>
<P>
A United Parcel Service driver from Oceanside, Johnson said it took him about 
40 minutes to put chains on his truck, and some of the stores he tried to make 
deliveries to were closed. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't get down some of the roads, so I have to ask people to pick up their 
packages," he said. "Snow's no fun if you're working."

COUNTY SHORT-CHANGED ON FUNDS, JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bolstering San Diego County's claim that the state has shortchanged it by tens 
of millions of dollars in mental health funding, a local judge tentatively 
ruled Thursday that the county has been deprived of its fair share of some of 
those dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In what county officials hailed as a significant decision that strengthens 
their hand in their nearly 3-year-old lawsuit against the state, Superior Court 
Judge Barbara Gamer tentatively decided that the state's method of distributing 
mental health dollars violates a law governing such allocations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a step in the right direction, but it's only the first step," said 
Deputy County Counsel Michael Poynor. "This ruling does not solve San Diego's 
complete mental health needs. Only a complete restructuring of the financing 
formula, so that every county gets its fair share -- nothing more and nothing 
less -- will do that." 
</P>
<P>
But an attorney for the state, emphasizing that Gamer's ruling is only 
tentative and does not directly address the overall equity of the state's 
mental health funding system, characterized Thursday's ruling as a relatively 
small battle in a war that could have statewide implications. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds like the county is getting a little ahead of itself, because this is 
not a final decision, and it does not even deal with the fair share and overall 
fairness question," said state attorney Lesley Sive. 
</P>
<P>
Similar to two 1986 lawsuits that San Diego filed against the state concerning 
alleged inequities in the distribution of property taxes and other revenues, 
the mental health suit stems from the county's complaint that its allocation of 
state revenue for that purpose is also vastly inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Though county officials concede that the San Diego delegation's lack of 
legislative clout in Sacramento contributed to the predicament, they argue that 
unfair funding formulas -- and the state's failure to adhere to its own 
guidelines -- have dramatically worsened the financial shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
During earlier hearings, Poynor emphasized that San Diego receives $19 per 
capita annually for mental health services, less than the statewide average of 
$28 and far below the $62 per person awarded to San Francisco County. Since the 
mid-1980s, the gap between San Diego's allocation and the statewide average has 
cost the county about $20 million annually, Poynor said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the state's funding discrimination, we have been prevented from 
providing needed care to the mentally ill of this region," county Supervisor 
George Bailey said. "The impact of this unfair situation can be seen on our 
streets every day. This is legally and morally wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's tentative decision came in the first phase of a two-part trial. In 
the more critical second phase, scheduled to begin late next month, the county 
will ask the court to rule on the legality of the state's overall mental health 
funding formula, which county attorneys contend violates the equal protection 
clauses of the state and federal constitutions. 
</P>
<P>
The origin of Thursday's ruling is a 1986 state law specifying that any 
additional mental health dollars beyond those then being received by counties 
should go to under-funded counties such as San Diego. However, rather than 
strictly comply with that measure -- an attempt to at least partly remedy 
funding inequities -- the state actually has sent millions of additional 
dollars to counties such as San Francisco, Marin, San Mateo, Napa and Alameda 
that already receive allocations in excess of the statewide average, county 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In tentatively siding with the county on that question, Gamer ruled that the 
state has, in fact, violated the provisions of that law.

FPPC CHARGES ESCONDIDO MOBILE HOME PARK OWNER

The state Fair Political Practices Commission on Thursday charged a North 
County developer and mobile home park owner with failing to report nearly 
$30,000 contributed to two 1988 political campaigns, including one to roll back 
mobile home rents in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
An 11-count accusation issued by the political watchdog agency says Richard 
Kuebler, owner of the Moonglow Mobile Home Park in Escondido, ignored state 
laws requiring him to disclose $23,000 in donations to groups opposing the 
Escondido rent-control ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
It also accused the owner of KB Enterprises of illegally paying intermediaries 
$6,800 in cash to prepare and send 20,000 last-minute campaign "hit pieces" 
against Poway City Councilman Robert Emery, a slow-growth advocate. 
</P>
<P>
The charges now go to an administrative law judge, who will weigh the evidence 
and recommend what course the FPPC should take. Under state law, Kuebler could 
face a maximum fine of $22,000 -- or $2,000 per allegation. 
</P>
<P>
Reached Thursday at his San Diego offices, Kuebler declined to respond to the 
FPPC action. "I have no comment at this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Emery, a social studies teacher at Hidden Valley Middle School in 
Escondido, said that "it's about time that the truth came out on this. 
Everybody knew it, but it took this long for the accusations to be brought 
forward by the FPPC." 
</P>
<P>
According to Poway City Manager Jim Bowersox, Kuebler has had considerable 
interest in city land-use decisions but has "not been at the forefront of 
politics." He said Kuebler owns several contiguous parcels at the east end of 
Garden and Sycamore Canyon roads, and is developing a 60-unit mobile home park 
bounded by Midland, Poway and Community roads. 
</P>
<P>
The FPPC allegation says that Kuebler reimbursed two men -- Michael Galasso and 
Bob Guerrero -- in cash for $6,800 in expenses to produce and send derogatory 
material to 20,000 residents about Emery, then mayor, immediately before the 
November, 1988, election. 
</P>
<P>
One piece depicted "friends" of Emery apparently paying him off for his votes 
by shoving dollar bills into his pockets. The other blamed the slow-growth 
council member for Poway traffic jams. Emery won reelection despite the 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Kuebler allegedly violated state law in three ways through the mailer: He 
failed to list himself as the true sponsor, he failed to list his contributions 
on public disclosure forms, and he paid more than $100 in cash, the FPPC said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the FPPC said Kuebler failed to report a $10,000 contribution to 
Escondido Voters Against Rent Control, as well as $13,000 in donations to the 
Escondido Good Government Committee during the June, 1988, election. The first 
group opposed a mobile home rent control measure, and the latter opposed three 
Escondido council candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the opposition, the rent control ordinance passed with nearly 59% of 
the vote. The measure has rolled back short-term mobile home leases to 1986 
prices, a move that city records show affected 87 of the 96 spaces in Kuebler's 
park. 
</P>
<P>
Monthly rents now average $253 at Moonglow, situated at 900 Howard Avenue, and 
Kuebler has yet to file for an increase since the 1988 measure passed, city 
records show.

CORONADO'S SOMETIMES-CRITICIZED POLICE CHIEF RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly a decade ago, Jerry Boyd rode into Coronado a flamboyant figure, a 
lawman who nabbed suspects in high-speed chases, responded to late-night police 
calls and made many of his own arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty unusual for the chief of police. 
</P>
<P>
His aggressiveness brought criticism, especially from the police union that was 
battling management in the mid-1980s. But Boyd continued to pull on the uniform 
and steer a patrol car through town when he felt like it. 
</P>
<P>
Come Jan. 11, he will cross the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge and leave for a 
new job as chief of police in the Northern California town of Martinez, in 
Contra Costa County. The two cities share similarities: population, department 
size and a low crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd, 44, said Thursday he believed he had accomplished just about all he could 
in upscale Coronado, where, in the chief's 10-year tenure, two people have been 
slain. 
</P>
<P>
The most pressing order of the day is getting a new police station for the 
force of 43 uniformed officers and 17 civilian officers and staff members. 
Plans have been approved, and construction is scheduled to begin next summer. 
</P>
<P>
When Boyd got to town in 1981, he already had spent eight years as a Los 
Angeles County sheriff's deputy and sergeant and six years as a lieutenant and 
captain for the Irvine Police Department in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
While captain, Boyd said, he got into a run-in with Irvine's police chief, who 
had tried to destroy a police report on an Irvine city councilwoman, which led 
to Boyd being assigned a 4 p.m.-to-midnight shift with no command 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
In Coronado, Boyd was branded a frustrated cop by police critics when, in his 
first year, he went undercover and helped rescue a 3-year-old girl from a 
kidnaper after negotiating for nearly an hour. The incident brought Boyd 
fleeting fame in the national media. 
</P>
<P>
Some officers believed Boyd would have better served the department sitting 
behind a desk, instead of leading the troops into battle, making his own 
arrests and even using physical force, by his own count, on at least a half a 
dozen occasions. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly four years ago, the Coronado Police Officers Assn. asked for either the 
San Diego County Sheriff's Department or the state attorney general to 
investigate allegations that Boyd used excessive force and profanity during a 
1987 arrest of a robbery suspect and that he improperly used police video 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller reviewed the matter, called the allegations 
"frivolous" and said no investigation was warranted. 
</P>
<P>
A television videotape of the suspect's arrest showed Boyd holding a revolver 
and twice shouting, "Shut your . . . mouth" while police held the suspect. Boyd 
said he was justified in using profanity at the time because he was dealing 
with "an ex-con." Boyd also defended punching the suspect in the stomach 
because the suspect was about to kick an officer. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Boyd described the criticism in the mid-'80s as the 
low point of his career in Coronado and said it was raised only because of 
labor disputes with the city's police union. Despite the second-guessing, he 
said he wouldn't change his tactics. 
</P>
<P>
"I will continue to put on a uniform and go out and ride in Martinez," he said. 
"I contend that the chief should have firsthand knowledge of what his people 
are doing. I need to know that city and I won't get to know it sitting behind a 
desk." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez has a population of 30,332, and 45 sworn officers, compared to 
Coronado's 23,681 population and 43 sworn officers. 
</P>
<P>
According to 1989 FBI statistics, Coronado had no murders, eight rapes, 12 
robberies, 26 aggravated assaults, 166 burglaries, 551 thefts and 151 auto 
thefts. During the same time frame, Martinez had one murder, six rapes, 24 
robberies, 36 aggravated assaults, 336 burglaries, 912 thefts and 146 auto 
thefts. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Keith James, a member of the Coronado Police Officers Assn., said 
Boyd's years in the city were positive. 
</P>
<P>
"On one hand, we're losing a good chief," James said. "On the other hand, we're 
excited by the change. But the chief's going to be missed. He's done a lot. 
He's just up for a different challenge now."

RECALL TAKES AIM AT BISHOP, LEADER OF OCEANSIDE COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Melba Bishop, the onetime darling rebel of the Oceanside City Council who has 
boasted of her grass-roots popularity, has been targeted for recall, just two 
weeks after she surfaced as the matriarch of the new City Council majority. 
</P>
<P>
Two detractors who filed preliminary recall papers with the Oceanside City 
Clerk's office this week called Bishop "an embarrassment to the city" by, among 
other things, wielding her new political power like a scythe through City 
Hall's establishment. 
</P>
<P>
If successful, Bishop's recall would be the first since 1982 -- when Bishop led 
her own successful recall campaign against then-council members Bill Bell and 
Ray Burgess. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop had served on the council from 1980 to 1984, when she ran unsuccessfully 
for the mayor's post, and was elected again to the council in 1988. She now is 
targeted by two Oceanside residents, Ed Wicburg and Michael Balin, who 
announced Wednesday their intention to seek her removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
The two men will have about six months to collect the signatures of about 8,400 
city voters -- 15% of the city's electorate -- in order to force a recall 
election. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not testing her popularity," said Wicburg, a businessman involved with 
property rentals. "I just don't like what's happened in the past few weeks, so 
as a citizen I'm standing up." 
</P>
<P>
His reference was to the Oceanside City Council meeting Dec. 5, when Bishop and 
new council members and Bishop allies Nancy York and Don Rodee -- at their 
debut meeting -- removed Mayor Larry Bagley and Councilman Sam Williamson from 
key committee posts and ousted four of the city's seven planning commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
It added to an already tumultuous City Hall environment in which key city 
officials -- from city manager to redevelopment director to police chief -- 
have resigned in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In the recall notification papers, Wicburg and Balin said Bishop has 
"arrogantly with malice usurped the authority of the elected mayor in committee 
appointments, engineering the removal of all citizen committee members who 
publicly disagree with her." 
</P>
<P>
They also alleged that Bishop tried to influence the disposition of undetailed 
"police cases affecting her family members," and "forced city administrators to 
employ her son at above-normal starting rates to the detriment of other 
applicants." 
</P>
<P>
They also blamed Bishop for costing the city more than $2 million in litigation 
over the city's controversial growth management ordinance, of "pretending to 
favor slow growth," of delaying the improvements of California 76 through the 
eastern side of the city, and of "consistently" violating the state's 
open-meeting laws by meeting secretly with "her two obedient servants." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop, 48, denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they're well-meaning, but they're reacting to the election because they 
don't like how it turned out," she said. "I've done nothing to harm this city. 
I worked to elect two people . . . who can clean up some of the poor practices 
in the city and get us out of our $5.8 million deficit. That's given people a 
lot of fodder."

USX to Pay Record Safety Fine: The nation's biggest steel maker agreed to pay 
$3.25 million for health and safety violations at two of its mills. 
</P>
<P>
USX's USS division reached the settlement over alleged unsafe conditions at its 
Fairless Works plant, outside Philadelphia, and its Clairton Works, near 
Pittsburgh. The federal agency had charged that Fairless had unsafe walks, 
cranes and electrical equipment and did not do enough to protect workers' 
hearing. It will be the largest payment in the history of the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration, eclipsing a fine of $1.5 million paid by 
Chrysler Corp. in 1988 over violations at a plant in Newark, Del.

Appeals Court Backs Eastern's Pilots: Pilots at Eastern Airlines who were

Eastern pilots, who have been sidelined since the strike ended in November, 
1989, a union spokesman said.

Four years ago, Bob Page's car was hit head-on by a drunk driver. The drunk 
driver died. Page survived -- but suffered 15 broken bones and a bruised heart. 
</P>
<P>
For five months after his release from the hospital, Page had to use a 
wheelchair, depending on his parents, friends and employees to keep 
Replacements Ltd. going. His Greensboro, N.C., firm, which specializes in 
supplying customers with obsolete china, crystal and silver patterns, survived 
his personal disaster and has flourished. 
</P>
<P>
But not all small-business owners are as lucky as Page. 
</P>
<P>
"I had personal disability insurance that paid about $1,000 a month," Page 
said. "My salary continued because I owned the company, and I was lucky to have 
people around me to help run the business." 
</P>
<P>
Hard-driving, passionate entrepreneurs are especially reluctant to think about 
what would happen to their businesses if they were disabled. So persuading them 
to buy personal disability insurance is tough, insurance agents and executives 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, a busy entrepreneur risks losing everything if he or she is unable to work 
and is not properly insured. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two forms of death," said John Swenson, who specializes in 
disability issues at New York Life Insurance Co. in Manhattan. "One form is 
where the insured dies and the family is left to work things out. The other, 
more agonizing, death is when the individual becomes disabled and there is no 
income." 
</P>
<P>
Insurance executives believe that 60% to 70% of the nation's small-business 
owners have no personal disability coverage. This is a chilling estimate when 
you consider that at age 37 -- the prime age for an entrepreneur -- the 
probability of becoming disabled is 3 1/2 times higher than the probability of 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Many small-business owners, already stretching to meet payroll and production 
costs, may think they are saving money by not buying disability insurance for 
themselves. But the premiums are surprisingly affordable and the benefits 
available are tailored to meet individual needs. (See chart). 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all personal disability policies offer the same kinds of benefits. 
Disability insurance policies generally pay a monthly benefit that is slightly 
less than what you would earn if you were healthy and working. This gap is 
intentional; insurers want you to have an incentive to get well and get back to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
The kind of policy you qualify for depends on what you do for a living. 
Professionals, such as attorneys and architects, have the easiest time buying 
disability insurance. Automobile and real estate salespeople, subject to the 
ups and down of the economy, have a tougher time. People in risky professions, 
such as private detectives, construction workers, actors and stunt car drivers, 
may have to look a long time for a policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The underwriter looks at the likelihood of the person being disabled and how 
long they will stay on disability," explained Harris Kagan, a New York Life 
insurance agent in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"An agent needs to know how much money you need to protect your mortgage, 
debts, wife, husband and children," Kagan said. 
</P>
<P>
You can save money on the premium by being willing to wait 60 to 90 days after 
the disabling event for the insurance benefits to kick in. The purpose of this 
"elimination period" is to remove some of the incentives for the insured to 
begin collecting disability benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer a person has to go without receiving income from their normal job, 
the less incentive they may have to claim a disability," said Danny Lerner, a 
partner at Commercial Benefits, a Woodland Hills firm specializing in 
individual and business insurance planning. 
</P>
<P>
Disability insurance underwriters also consider the number of employees you 
have, the length of time you've been in business and the claims history in your 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The question they ask is, 'Does this person have an incentive to be disabled?' 
" said Lerner. 
</P>
<P>
Lerner said Californians have the toughest time obtaining disability coverage 
because claims here have "gone through the roof." Californians tend to file an 
extraordinarily high number of disability claims stemming from mental stress 
and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, disability benefits are tax-fee. But if your company pays for the 
premium and takes a tax deduction for the expense, your benefits will be taxed. 
To avoid this, most insurance planners recommend paying for the policy with 
personal funds. 
</P>
<P>
It is also important to make sure the policy covers your specific occupation, 
not just any occupation. This means if you are president of a tool 
manufacturing company and you suffer a heart attack that prevents you from 
doing your old job, you can still be paid your benefits even if you take up a 
less-taxing, lower-paying occupation later. 
</P>
<P>
Although it's cheaper to buy a policy that provides benefits to age 65, Lerner 
recommends paying a bit extra for a policy that provides lifetime benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bob Page is fully recovered and busy running his growing company. 
Since his accident, Page increased his own disability benefits coverage to 
$5,000 a month and recently purchased long- and short-term disability coverage 
for his 160 workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BUYING DISABILITY INSURANCE 
</P>
<P>
* Figure out how much money you need to cover all your personal, monthly 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
* Obtain estimates from several different insurance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
* Check the financial stability and strength of the company you choose to deal 
with. 
</P>
<P>
* Although it costs more, it pays to buy a policy providing lifetime benefits. 
</P>
<P>
* Consider buying business interruption coverage to further protect your 
business from collapsing after a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DISABILITY INSURANCE: THE NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
Disability insurance is cheaper than you think. Here are premium estimates for 
a hypothetical small-business owner who is 35 and a nonsmoker. He or she owns a 
retail store and has some supervisory duties. These premiums are for a basic 
policy that pays benefits until age 65. The individual pays the policy and must 
wait 90 days for the benefits to go into effect.

BOARD PROPOSES NEW ACCOUNTING RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a flurry of activity this week, accounting rule makers announced plans to 
set standards that may cost individuals and industry billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Accounting Standards Board, an organization that sets rules for 
financial reporting at publicly held companies, sent out two separate 
"statements" advising companies and accountants of upcoming changes this week. 
</P>
<P>
One such change will force companies to set up reserves for their employees' 
post-retirement medical benefits instead of paying these benefits out of 
current earnings, which is the general industry practice. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry experts believe that if corporations did nothing to restrict 
their costs (that is, cut back on employee benefits), this rule could cut 
corporate profits by upward of $200 billion over a period of years. 
</P>
<P>
The other rule is designed to give shareholders more current information about 
company-held investment portfolios. But company insiders and analysts complain 
that it will force financial institutions to spend millions hiring legions of 
actuaries and accountants to do nothing but comply with the proposed rule. 
</P>
<P>
Neither rule will go into effect immediately. The medical benefit rule, for 
example, starts in 1993. And the other could be delayed even longer. But 
already companies and their consultants are scrambling -- trying to change 
their operations in ways that will make these rules less costly. 
</P>
<P>
"This will have a significant impact on companies, their financial results and 
their employees," said Marsha Venturi, consulting actuary with Buck Consultants 
in Secaucus, N.J., about the retirement benefit rule. "When companies take a 
good look at how expensive those benefits are, they are going to start 
re-evaluating what they provide." 
</P>
<P>
Already Venturi says several of her clients have changed benefit programs to 
limit their future expenses. Some are requiring retirees to ante up more per 
month for their own insurance, others are capping company-paid benefits and 
others are making working employees contribute more to pay for benefits they 
may collect when they retire. 
</P>
<P>
In short, companies may find their earnings hit by the rule, but employees will 
feel the pinch, too, Venturi added. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, financial services companies are still trying to fight a proposed 
rule that would force them to disclose the current market value of their loans 
and investment portfolios in the footnotes of their financial statements. 
</P>
<P>
Although these footnotes are generally read only by accountants, financial 
analysts and reporters, some complain that calculating the figure will require 
legions of accountants and actuaries. 
</P>
<P>
The rules would apply to all companies, but banks, savings and loans and 
insurance firms would be most affected because they often hold large portfolios 
of loans and investments. 
</P>
<P>
These assets are generally recorded on their books at their original purchase 
prices. The accounting rule makers want companies to say what the assets would 
be worth if they had to sell them today. 
</P>
<P>
"This will cost millions. Serious millions," said Joyce Culbert, vice president 
of research at Firemark Insurance Research in Parsippany, N.J. "Insurance 
companies would have to have appraisers on staff to re-evaluate every 
(shopping) mall. And you'd need another horde of actuaries to figure out the 
present value of your insurance policies. This would be exceptionally costly." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, many industry observers favor the new rules because they say they 
will give investors a better picture of a company's true financial health. 
Post-retirement benefits can be a huge liability. And if it is not disclosed, 
investors could be blindsided when a company is forced to start paying these 
benefits from current earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, financial services regulators have been widely criticized for 
allowing "once-upon-a-time" accounting of investment portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
Accounting standards that didn't require up-to-the-minute disclosure of what 
assets were worth were cited as a major problem in the savings and loan 
debacle. Some experts maintain that regulators simply didn't know how sick some 
thrifts had become because accounting rules didn't force them to disclose when 
their investments had soured.

PEOPLE: MONDAVI RETIRES FROM RUNNING WINERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Mondavi, the globe-trotting chairman of the Napa Valley winery that 
bears his name, has retired from daily management operations. He remains 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a manager and I'll miss it," said the 77-year-old visionary, who is 
credited with dragging the sleepy California wine industry of the early 1960s 
into the arena of world-class winemaking. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see my sons achieve what I've achieved, and I think they will. . . . 
The future is bright," Mondavi said of his sons Michael and Timothy, president 
and winemaker respectively, and equal managing partners. 
</P>
<P>
"The Robert Mondavi family will continue its dedication to and active 
participation in the production and marketing of the highest quality premium 
varietal wines," his sons said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Mondavi left his family's Charles Krug Winery and in 1966 built the first new 
winery in California since Prohibition. The Spanish mission-style winery draws 
nearly 500,000 visitors a year. The family also owns other California wineries.

TESTS ON C-5B CARGO JETS WEREN'T DONE, EX-OFFICER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: THE AIR FORCE HAD REPORTED TO CONGRESS THAT THERE WERE NO FLAWS IN ITS 
LARGEST CARGO CARRIERS. A RETIRED COLONEL SAYS ONLY FRACTION OF AIRCRAFT WERE 
CHECKED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Air Force official said Thursday that the service, despite orders from 
Congress, failed to carry out a 1986 inspection of potential defects in some of 
Lockheed's C-5B cargo jets, raising new questions about whether the planes are 
safe to fly. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force had reported to Congress -- supposedly after conducting a 
detailed investigation -- that there were no flaws in the jets. At the time, 
the finding allayed doubts created by whistle-blowers' assertions that some of 
the huge jets had defective frames. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday, Lawrence B. Welborn, a retired lieutenant colonel, said in an 
interview that Air Force inspectors tested only "a small fraction" of the 
aircraft structures they later claimed in the report to have reviewed. Welborn 
said he was in charge of preparing the C-5B aircraft for inspection in 1986 at 
Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
A Lockheed spokesman strongly denied that the C-5B is flawed but said the 
company has "no firsthand knowledge of the details" of the Air Force's special 
inspection. Other tests, he said, show the aircraft do not contain structural 
defects. 
</P>
<P>
The C-5B aircraft are the largest cargo carriers used by the Air Force and have 
played a critical role in supplying material to Operation Desert Shield. The 
structural frames in question are so critical that their failure in flight 
could cause the aircraft to crash. 
</P>
<P>
The assertions by Welborn prompted a demand Thursday by Rep. John D. Dingell 
(D-Mich.), whose subcommittee on oversight and investigations requested the 
special inspection in 1986, for the Defense Department's inspector general to 
investigate whether the Air Force misled or submitted false documents to 
Congress. Dingell's call came after he obtained a copy of an affidavit taken 
from Welborn by attorney Herbert Hafif in connection with a Los Angeles civil 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
An Air Force spokesman said that as a matter of policy he would have no comment 
on a matter that may become the subject of investigation by the inspector 
general. 
</P>
<P>
In a harshly worded letter to Deputy Inspector General Derek Vander Schaaf, 
Dingell said Thursday that the Air Force or its top officers "attempted to 
deliberately mislead the subcommittee by submitting misleading or false 
documents to the subcommittee." 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing called by Dingell on Dec. 3, 1986, former Air Force Gen. Lawrence 
Skantze, who had been the Air Force's procurement chief, testified that the 
service had not accepted flawed aircraft parts. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Skantze pledged to thoroughly inspect the C-5B and report back to 
the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
The report submitted Jan. 5, 1987, stated that 24 suspect forgings installed in 
three C-5Bs and one C-5A aircraft had been exhaustively inspected. Diagrams of 
the main frames -- circular structures up to 20 feet high that bear the planes' 
load in flight -- showed that hundreds of points were inspected. 
</P>
<P>
But in the affidavit obtained by Dingell and in an interview Thursday, Welborn 
said he was in charge of removing the acoustic and skin panels of the three 
C-5B aircraft that provided the inspectors with access to the main frames. Only 
one area of one C-5B was exposed for testing on Dec. 6, 1986, he said. No 
information is known about inspections of the C-5A, which apparently occurred 
at Lockheed's Marietta, Ga., plant the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the report to the subcommittee stated conclusively: "Structural integrity 
of the 24 suspected forgings was confirmed." 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with attorneys, company officials and congressional sources provided 
no information showing that Skantze himself knew that the tests had not been 
completed, even though he signed the report. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview late Thursday, Skantze said: "At the time I signed the 
letter, I had been assured that the inspection had been done. Given the gravity 
of the issue, I am appalled that our people would have assured me the job was 
done correctly, if indeed it was not done." 
</P>
<P>
The C-5B controversy appears to be escalating. 
</P>
<P>
Only last month, a Los Angeles jury imposed a $45.3-million judgment on 
Lockheed in a civil case in which two former auditors and a quality assurance 
representative asserted that they were fired after trying to alert management 
to the C-5B defects. It was these employees who initially brought the alleged 
defects to Dingell's attention in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The judgment is believed to be the largest in history against a defense 
contractor. Lockheed has asked for a new trial, claiming errors by the judge 
and jury misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, it was learned Thursday that the three former Lockheed employees 
have also filed suit against Lockheed under the federal False Claims Act, which 
allows individuals to sue defense contractors on behalf of the government. 
</P>
<P>
Hafif, the Claremont attorney representing the former employees, obtained a 
sworn affidavit from Welborn to support allegations in that suit. "We have the 
proof that the inspections were never done," Hafif said. "The track record of 
these aircraft shows there were problems from birth." 
</P>
<P>
The three former Lockheed employees have alleged that 26 forgings used in the 
main frames were improperly heat-treated and that they now contain 
metallurgical flaws. Two of the main frames were not used. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a defective oven, the main frames were overheated, resulting in a 
technical condition called "eutectic melting," in which certain metals inside 
the aluminum alloy melt and cause voids and cracks, the former employees said 
during the Los Angeles trial. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed asserted at trial that the employees had lied about the problem and 
that they were fired for falsely claiming that there was a management cover-up 
of the problem. Jurors later said in interviews that they were shocked by 
Lockheed's practices and wanted to send a message to the defense industry with 
the huge award. 
</P>
<P>
But throughout the case, Lockheed has strongly defended the aircraft. The 
company renewed its defense Thursday, amid the latest revelations. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no firsthand knowledge of the details of AF testing of C-5B main 
frames following Gen. Skantze's testimony before the committee," the Lockheed 
spokesman said. "We understand that Gen. Skantze advised the committee that 
tests did not disclose any metallurgical defects in the main frames. 
</P>
<P>
"In any case, the tests previously performed by Lockheed and validated by Air 
Force metallurgists established the metallurgical soundness of the main frames. 
We have absolutely no reason to doubt the general's testimony or the soundness 
of the C-5B." 
</P>
<P>
In the telephone interview, Welborn said the whole incident "bothers me 
tremendously," even though at the time he did not know precisely what the 
investigators from Air Force headquarters were looking for. 
</P>

Welborn said that to inspect as many points as were indicated in the 1987 
report, it would have required that several aircraft be inspected for a period 
of two to three days. But the investigators spent only an hour or two on the 
one aircraft, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also said some of the inspection points detailed in the report would have 
required lower skin panels be removed from the cargo area of the aircraft. 
Those panels, he said, were never removed. 
</P>
<P>
Welborn is not involved in any of the lawsuits against Lockheed. He said he 
retired from the Air Force last year and now builds furniture in his home in 
Missouri.

AIR TRAFFIC: Holiday air traffic is expected to peak Saturday at the expanded 
John Wayne Airport, exceeding the 15,500 passengers who moved through the 
terminal last Dec. 22. The number will decline gradually to Christmas Day, then 
increase again. "We expect a little bit more (traffic) than last year, but . .

AUTO FOCUS: Thousands of cars are broken into every year, above, but there are 
ways to avoid becoming a statistic. Since many car burglars are after stereos, 
you can protect yourself by using pull-out stereo mounts and removing the 
player when your car is unoccupied, says Costa Mesa Police Detective Darell 
Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
Common sense helps too. Park in well-lighted, occupied areas and use audible 
alarm systems. "Burglars hate to be heard and seen," Freeman says.

CHRISTMAS BONUS: It may not be an official holiday, but Monday will be a day 
off with pay for many workers in Orange County, including those at Rockwell 
International in Anaheim, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. in Huntington 
Beach and the main headquarters of Del Taco Inc. in Costa Mesa. 
</P>

CHECKPOINTS MAKE HOLIDAY APPEARANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The first thing a drunk driver loses is judgment, say police, and over and over 
that point is demonstrated at sobriety checkpoints conducted during the 
holidays in South County. 
</P>
<P>
By law, police must warn drivers of checkpoints and provide well-marked 
turnoffs for those who choose to avoid them. But despite the large signs and 
handy escape route, nine people failed a sobriety test and were arrested at a 
checkpoint recently in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"That just amazes me," said Lt. George Johnson of the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department. "We post those signs way up ahead with plenty of time to turn off, 
and people still drive through while impaired." 
</P>
<P>
In December, officials are conducting checkpoints every Friday and Saturday in 
Mission Viejo, San Juan Capistrano, Dana Point and Laguna Niguel. This weekend, 
they will be in Dana Point on Friday at Coast Highway and Niguel Road and at 
Avery and Marguerite parkways in Mission Viejo on Saturday. Laguna Beach will 
hold its first checkpoint of the holiday season Friday at an undisclosed 
location. 
</P>
<P>
But netting intoxicated motorists is not the only purpose of the checkpoint 
program, police officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing is not catching drunk drivers," said Johnson, "but to use 
(checkpoints) as an educational tool. And I think the public appreciates this." 
</P>
<P>
Officers manning the checkpoints often get waves and high-five signs from those 
passing through them, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"People are saying that they are not going to tolerate drinking and driving," 
he added. "And they tell me they are glad someone is doing something about it." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach has been conducting sobriety checks since 1986, dubbing their 
program "Saturday Night Alive," police Sgt. Ray Lardie said. 
</P>
<P>
In those four years, 99 people have been arrested on suspicion of drunk driving 
and more than 17,000 cars have been stopped, Lardie said. 
</P>
<P>
Lardie said that the location of the checkpoint will remain secret until it is 
set up at 8 p.m. Manning the checkpoint will be two specially trained officers, 
who will be paid through a grant by the California Office of Traffic Safety. 
</P>
<P>
"These programs reflect the commitment of the city of Laguna Beach and its 
police department to strictly enforce the DUI laws," Lardie said. FRANK MESSINA

POLICE TEAM UP TO REDUCE ACCIDENTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach police departments have joined forces 
to cut down on traffic accidents along roads on which drivers tend to speed. 
</P>
<P>
The Case Team program was started last year in Huntington Beach, and Fountain 
Valley recently joined the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from both cities often patrol problem streets and set up large orange 
signs warning drivers that traffic enforcement is ahead. The Case Team chooses 
a particular route based on its high accident rate and maintains a presence for 
up to 10 hours at different times. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not hiding behind a billboard," Fountain Valley Police Officer David 
Kanbara said. "We actually tell the public we're out there." 
</P>
<P>
Though they stop many vehicles for even minor violations, Kanbara said that few 
tickets are written. The program was designed to encourage voluntary compliance 
with traffic laws and good driving habits. "Our major concern is that people 
wear seat belts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When drivers are stopped for violations, officers tell them why and hand out 
flyers listing the most frequent violations that result in fatalities or major 
injuries. "It's a 30-second contact to let them know to drive carefully," 
Kanbara said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers also talk to pedestrians and bicyclists as part of the traffic safety 
and enforcement program. ROSE APODACA

YOUNGSTERS BRING GIFTS TO SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like elves bearing gifts, a bus full of schoolchildren arrived Thursday morning 
at Friendship Shelter with freshly baked bread, Christmas tree ornaments and 
almost $400 cash meant to brighten the holidays at the city's only homeless 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 youngsters bound up the stairs and filled an upstairs sitting room 
where, moments before, three residents had quietly untangled strands of lights 
for a bare Christmas tree in the corner of the room. 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters, all from the Community Learning Center, an 
alternative-education program at Top of The World Elementary School, carried 
handmade ornaments, bright red stockings and cranberry scones for Christmas 
morning. Paul Lithgow, a 26-year-old resident, exchanged greetings and 
high-fives with several boys: "Hey dudes, how's it going?" 
</P>
<P>
As they deposited their gifts, the first- through fourth-grade children took 
turns telling how they earned money to help shelter residents. A youngster with 
freckles and bright blue eyes said he created a money-making magic show, 
another boy sold used books on the school playground and a third child washed 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
One young entrepreneur raised $31 selling lemonade during a school soccer game. 
Kyra Pitt, 10, earned $15 doing household chores with her 7-year-old brother, 
Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
"I like helping people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And 6-year-old Amanda David, who wore a crimson sweat shirt with "I Believe In 
Santa Claus" on the chest, said she broke her piggy bank to get money for the 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Kathie Reynolds said she is proud of the children's response to a 
community need. 
</P>
<P>
"It represents so much hard work on their part, and thoughtfulness," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Heather Davis-Barton, the day supervisor, thanked the children and said, "We 
wouldn't have ornaments for the tree if you hadn't come or any decorations for 
the house." 
</P>
<P>
It was the third year that youngsters, parents and teachers from the school 
have focused their efforts on Friendship Shelter, director Colin Henderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of glaring as far as what most people expect to have at Christmas 
and what people in the shelter can expect," Henderson said. "A lot of people in 
the shelter get extremely depressed in the holiday season. It reminds them of 
Christmas in childhood when things were much easier." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday morning, after the youngsters piled back onto the bus and quiet again 
settled over the sitting room, Lithgow smiled broadly and said he will help 
decorate the tree with the boxes of ornaments and paper chains that were left 
stacked nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"It helped me get in the spirit a little more," he said. LESLIE EARNEST

COUNCIL OKS SEIZURE OF LOTS NEAR PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has voted to take by eminent domain the remaining portions of 
seven "encyclopedia lots" in the Central Park area. The city earlier this year 
had voted to acquire most of the lots so that Ellis Avenue could be widened. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners protested this week that the city doesn't actually need the 
lots and is not offering enough money for them. The council, however, said the 
land is needed and that Orange County Superior Court will determine its value. 
</P>
<P>
The land in question consists of small tracts given away about 80 years ago as 
part of an Encyclopedia Americana sales campaign. People who bought a set of 
encyclopedias for $126 also were given a small lot in what was then an eroded 
gully area northwest of the small village of Huntington Beach. That land was 
considered worthless in those days. 
</P>
<P>
The city this year said the fair market value of the 25-by-112-foot lots is 
$10,000 each. Owners believe the land is worth more than that, and sued to 
block the city's seizure of the land. The case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
In the earlier eminent domain action this year, the city sought to take only 
portions of the lots immediately needed for widening Ellis Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Monday night moved to buy the rest of the land because the 
remnants would not be marketable. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Harmon, of Burbank, owner of one of the lots, was among those 
protesting the council's action. 
</P>
<P>
"The city already owns the land across the street (Ellis Avenue). It does not 
need my land," she argued. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Gail Hutton, however, said the rights of the lot owners are being 
legally protected by the Superior Court's review of the eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
"The court will decide what is appropriate," Hutton said. BILL BILLITER

FIREFIGHTERS PLAY SANTA WITH BIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dozens of firefighters spent their days off this week assembling more than 350 
tricycles, beach cruisers and 10-speed bicycles that will be given to hundreds 
of underprivileged or abused children on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
The bicycles were purchased with money raised by the Orange County Fire 
Department as part of Operation Santa Claus, a program run by the county's 
Social Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing worse than to see tears in the eyes of a child during 
Christmas, and this is our way of helping to alleviate some of that," said 
Capt. Hank Raymond, a firefighter who serves as the program's official Santa 
Claus. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 13,000 children were provided with gifts through the 
program, which is also supported by the Orange County Board of Supervisors, 
various county agencies, several businesses and the Orangewood Children's Home. 
</P>
<P>
The firefighters became involved in Operation Santa Claus after participating 
in the Toys for Tots program for many years. They switched to Operation Santa 
Claus in 1983 because it specifically addressed the needs of children in Orange 
County, Raymond said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in the business of protecting people, so firefighters have to have some 
kind of compassion and caring," Raymond said. "When we're out there in the line 
of duty, we get to see how some of the less fortunate live. This is a way to 
give a little bit back." 
</P>
<P>
This holiday season has been a particularly busy one for the firefighters. In 
addition to purchasing and assembling the bicycles, they have been collecting 
hundreds of toys, some of which were distributed at a party last weekend at 
Tustin Marine Corps Air Base for the families of military personnel involved in 
Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the toys will be given to children who are either staying in 
Orangewood Children's Home or in foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
To make sure that each gift suits a specific child, foster parents and social 
workers are invited to the Operation Santa Claus store at Orangewood where they 
can shop for an appropriate gift. 
</P>
<P>
"A unique part about this program is that a child isn't just handed a random 
gift. They usually get something that they asked for or need," Raymond said. 
</P>
<P>
Although donations to Operation Santa Claus have declined a bit this year, 
Raymond said it's still not too late to give. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone wishing to donate toys can drop them off, unwrapped, at any of the 
Orange County Fire Department's 46 stations, at any of the 52 Carl's Jr. 
restaurants in Orange County, or at the Orangewood Children's Home, 401 City 
Drive South, Orange. GREG HERNANDEZ

CITY-SCHOOL GROUP TACKLING PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A report released by a coalition of school and city officials defines the 
schools' greatest problems as gangs, crime, overcrowding and the need for day 
care. 
</P>
<P>
The report was released by the Anaheim City/Schools Coordinating Committee, 
which has been meeting for six months. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is an innovative attempt to better match school needs with city 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Tom Daly, who initiated the committee, said the meetings are a 
way for school district officials to share problems with city staff and perhaps 
find solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of these discussions could have happened without this committee, but I'm 
not sure they would have," Daly said. "A city can make great strides, but if 
our school system is not making progress, the community suffers. I want the 
city government to be a strong and helpful part of the school system." 
</P>
<P>
For example, at the Anaheim City School District, concerns about overcrowding 
in the central city area prompted the committee to discuss the issue with the 
City Council. The council has continued its commitment to down-zone that part 
of the city, which limits the number of high-density living quarters, such as 
apartments, that may be built in an area. 
</P>
<P>
Another Anaheim City School District concern that has not been addressed is how 
it will handle the hundreds of new students expected from development planned 
for the former Northrop property in an industrial part of north Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The group plans to resume meeting every other month, beginning in January. LISA

<P>
The Someone Cares soup kitchen in Costa Mesa is accepting toy donations for 
distribution to needy children during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"We have received plenty of donated food, but we don't have enough toys for the 
kids, said Art Rorden, a volunteer at the kitchen. "Their little eyes really 
light up, and we'd like to have enough to go around." 
</P>
<P>
The charity, operated by volunteers, will serve a free Christmas Eve meal from 
noon to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The kitchen operates year round, Monday through Friday from 2 to 4 p.m. at the 
South Coast Christian Church, 792 Victoria St.

KEEPING MEXICAN TRADITION ALIVE AT CHRISTMAS;

Fernando Rojas, 31, sat huddled with his two daughters at a table inside a hall 
here Thursday and explained to them the meaning of Las Posadas, a holiday 
tradition of Mexican Catholics that symbolizes Joseph and Mary's journey to 
Bethlehem. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important to keep the Mexican traditions alive for them because 
Christmas is very different in the United States," said Rojas, a Mexican 
immigrant who has lived in this country for four years. 
</P>
<P>
Rojas and his family were among the more than 400 low-income people who were 
invited to a large celebration of Las Posadas sponsored by Catholic Charities, 
a nonprofit organization based in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal with this party was to perpetuate something religious and cultural at 
Christmas because a lot of times, the true meaning of the holiday is lost," 
said coordinator Frank Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
Guests were treated to a large spread of Mexican sweet bread, cookies and cups 
of a Mexican hot chocolate called champurado, a thick drink made with milk, 
Ibarra-brand chocolate and cinnamon sticks. 
</P>
<P>
The event began with a group of about 30 children and parents in a candlelight 
procession. Traditionally, the group knocks on doors and is turned away until 
it reaches the home of the family hosting the posada. 
</P>
<P>
The re-enactment brought back fond memories for Antonio Hernandez, a 
50-year-old unemployed upholsterer who brought his 10-year-old daughter, 
Guadalupe, to the party. 
</P>
<P>
"For the Mexican people, Christmas is (celebrated) another way," said 
Hernandez, who left Mexico eight years ago. "But it is nice here, with Santa 
Claus." 
</P>
<P>
In a blending of two cultures, Santa Claus was on hand at the party to present 
each child with a stocking filled with toys and candy. 
</P>
<P>
Gustavo Molina, 10, quickly ran off the stage after visiting Santa and explored 
the contents of his stocking. Inside were Donald Duck and Goofy gum-ball 
dispensers and handfuls of candy. 
</P>
<P>
The John Marshall Elementary School fifth-grader from Westminster smiled, and 
said he still hoped to get a Nintendo game for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if my parents can afford it. They said they would try," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Neri, 9, got an extra big hug from Santa Claus, no doubt because he 
hobbled to the stage on crutches with a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the fourth-grader, whose parents are both unemployed, quickly pulled 
out the set of Ultra Fast Micro Machine cars that were stuffed in his stocking 
and examined them carefully. 
</P>
<P>
For many of the children at the party, the stockings, which were filled with 
items collected by the Catholic Charities Women's Auxiliary, would probably be 
the only presents they receive this Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be all because we don't have enough money this year," said 
Ofelia Mendoza, who brought three of her five children to the party. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza said that nearly all of her husband's income goes toward paying rent 
and buying food. She said there is very little, if any, left over. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is going to be a good Christmas, because although we are poor in 
everything, we have our health and we are together," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Monsignor Jaime Soto of the Diocese of Orange said he was happy to see a Las 
Posadas celebration on such a large scale. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea of doing these kinds of services within the spirit of Las Posadas 
gets to the root of what the real meaning of Christmas is," Soto said. "Las 
Posadas is about hospitality and about opening one's doors and seeing in a 
stranger the queen of heaven and the king of peace."

ZEBRA SKINS IMPORTER GUILTY OF GIVING FALSE STATEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: A FEDERAL JURY ACQUITTED A SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL ACCUSED OF ILLEGALLY 
IMPORTING AND SELLING NINE PELTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A South African national accused of illegally importing nine skins from a 
threatened species of zebra with the intent to unlawfully peddle them in Orange 
County was acquitted by a federal court jury Thursday of importing and selling 
the skins, but found guilty of making a false statement to a government 
official. 
</P>
<P>
Although the prosecution presented evidence that Wallace Charles Venter, 37, 
allegedly sold one of the skins to an undercover agent of the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, the jury was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that 
Venter "sold a threatened species knowing that it was illegal to do so," said 
Assistant U.S. Atty. John S. Wiley Jr. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Venter) said that there was no intention of selling (the skins) and that 
they would remain at a friend's house," said Wiley, who tried the case in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Venter's intentions were at issue in the case because while it is illegal under 
federal law to import a threatened species for commercial use, import is 
permitted for personal and non-commercial use. "The jury apparently believed 
the defendant's claim that he really didn't know (the sale) was illegal," Wiley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution charged that Venter placed two classified ads in the Orange 
County Register offering to sell hides of the threatened Hartmann's Mountain 
Zebra for up to $1,900. Venter was arrested in September after he allegedly 
sold one of the skins to the undercover agent. 
</P>
<P>
Venter's attorney, Morton H. Boren, could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
He contended in an interview Wednesday that Venter, who leads safari tours in 
South Africa, did not sell the skin but was merely using it as collateral while 
he arranged the sale of other, legally imported skins. Venter thought that 
transaction was legal, Boren said. 
</P>
<P>
But the jury was convinced that Venter knew what he was doing when he sent a 
notarized letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service saying that the skins 
had been purchased overseas by a man named Richard Sidowski, Wiley said. 
Prosecutors could not locate Sidowski for verification. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fish and Wildlife Service inquired as to what the skins were really going 
to be used for," Wiley said. "They needed a letter of explanation, and the 
defendant wrote and signed and notarized a letter saying he had no intention of 
selling the skins and that the skins would go to the house of Mr. Sidowski. The 
jury found that to be a false statement." 
</P>
<P>
Venter faces up to five years in prison, up to a $10,000 fine, or both, for 
making the false statement, Wiley said. U.S. District Court Judge William D. 
Keller set bail at $25,000 pending sentencing, but he could order Venter held 
in custody if he determines that Venter might flee the country. A sentencing 
date was not immediately set.

CONSTRUCTION SHAKES LOOSE ASBESTOS -- AND LIBRARIANS; 
</P>

HEALTH: A THEO LACY JAIL EXPANSION RATTLES BUILDINGS BOTH ON AND NEAR THE SITE. 
ASBESTOS IS JARRED OUT OF CEILINGS, FORCING TWO EVACUATIONS.

Orange County library administrators have been forced to flee their aging 
headquarters, and sheriff's deputies have had to shuffle more than 200 inmates 
at Theo Lacy branch jail, both as a result of construction that threatens to 
jar loose asbestos at those facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a personal safety decision to leave," Assistant County Librarian Carmen 
Martinez said Thursday. "The pile driving at the jail started shaking the 
building, and there was a real danger of asbestos snowing down on us." 
</P>
<P>
Jail construction has rattled buildings both on and near the site. Inmates had 
to be removed from two 120-man barracks at Theo Lacy for four days, county 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No inmates or library personnel are believed to have been exposed to asbestos, 
a known carcinogen that was often used as a fire retardant in older buildings. 
The Theo Lacy evacuations took place early this month; the inmates have been 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
Jail officials notified a federally appointed monitor about the asbestos 
problem and the need to move inmates, said Capt. Bob Kemmis, who oversees the 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
The monitor agreed that the situation warrants more double-bunking in other 
barracks, which is how the jail handled the overflow, Kemmis said. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt we should certainly err on the side of safety," he said. "Inmate 
safety was our paramount concern, and we thoroughly tested the barracks before 
we let anybody back. . . . It just wasn't a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
While the barracks were empty, asbestos removal crews entered, sealed the areas 
in plastic and scraped off the material. It was gathered into plastic bags, 
tested and discarded, officials said. The barracks were then certified as safe. 
</P>
<P>
Library and General Service Agency officials said the evacuation at the library 
headquarters, though hasty, also was without incident. 
</P>
<P>
Library administrators first noticed the shaking in mid-November, as pile 
drivers working on the jail expansion began rumbling the headquarters. The 
building has an old concrete roof, with asbestos lining parts of it, Martinez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As the pile drivers worked toward the library, the shaking became more 
pronounced, and some workers expressed concern. 
</P>
<P>
"The books started shaking," Martinez said. "We didn't expect it." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said her staff of about 60 full-time employees abandoned their 
headquarters late last month. Workers have taken up residence in other 
libraries around the county. 
</P>
<P>
Services to the public have not been affected, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
The move went "without a hitch," she added. Well, almost. Library 
administrators tried to leave answering machines on their lines to redirect 
phone calls, but the shaking got so bad that the machines came loose, so phones 
have just rung and rung. The lines are being switched over to a new prefix, but 
Thursday those numbers too went unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
"That's been the one frustration," Martinez conceded, "not being able to answer 
calls." 
</P>
<P>
While shaking at the library headquarters is expected to continue as long as 
the pile driving is going on, the effects at the jail have been less 
noticeable, which GSA Director Bert Scott attributed to different geologic 
conditions under the two facilities. The library is built over relatively light 
soil, making it more vulnerable to shaking. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, library workers could be affected for some time. Scott said he 
does not expect to be able to let them back in their building for about six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased with the way everybody's cooperated on this," Scott said.

LAWMEN FACE TRIAL IN INMATE'S BEATING; 
</P>
<P>
BRUTALITY: TWO ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES AND AN EX-MAYWOOD OFFICER WERE 
BOUND OVER TO SUPERIOR COURT.

<P>
Two Orange County sheriff's deputies and a former Maywood police officer were 
ordered Thursday to stand trial in Superior Court on charges they beat a 
Maywood jail inmate unconscious after attending a bachelor party. 
</P>
<P>
At a preliminary hearing, Municipal Judge Elva Soper ruled that there was 
enough evidence of a crime to try Deputies Ivan Budiselich, 26, John Rice, 25, 
and former Maywood Officer Michael A. Elliott, 31, on six felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
All three are accused of beating and threatening to hang Marino D. Martillo of 
Huntington Park in March while Martillo was in jail on traffic warrants. The 
incident, prosecutors said, occurred shortly after the officers became 
intoxicated at a colleague's bachelor party and went to the Maywood police 
station in a chauffeur-driven limousine. 
</P>
<P>
Each faces one count of "assault under color of authority" and one count of 
assault and battery with serious bodily injury. Also filed were additional 
special allegations of great bodily injury. They face a maximum penalty of four 
years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
During several hours on the witness stand, Martillo identified Elliott, 
Budiselich and Rice as his attackers. Budiselich, he said, appeared to lead the 
beating, which lasted several minutes in a jail cell. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony showed that the officers showed up at the department about 2 a.m. on 
March 23 to visit friends and play with a Breathalyzer, which is used to 
determine if someone is legally drunk. 
</P>
<P>
According to the district attorney, Elliott, Rice and Budiselich had been out 
drinking and celebrating with a second Maywood officer, Daniel Vasquez, who was 
getting married the next day. 
</P>
<P>
The three men were at the station the night in question and appeared to be 
having a good time, Maywood Officer John Hoglund told the court. He said he 
told them about an inmate with whom he had had an altercation earlier that 
evening. He said he did not know if the officers were drunk. 
</P>
<P>
A police dispatcher also testified that Elliott, Rice and Budiselich were at 
the station and entered the cell area. She said she later checked a jail video 
monitor and saw Elliott slapping Martillo with an open hand. 
</P>
<P>
The dispatcher told the court that she finally ordered the three men out of the 
cellblock because she could get in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants, prosecutors charge, posed as district attorney investigators, 
entered the jail area and singled out Martillo on the mistaken belief that he 
was the prisoner involved in the earlier altercation with Hoglund. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's doctor and a physician hired by the district attorney's office 
have concluded that Martillo, 30, suffered blurred vision, hearing loss and 
dizziness as a result of the alleged attack. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rice and Budiselich have filed claims for damages against the 
Maywood Police Department alleging that the city's jail procedures were 
inadequate and that the dispatcher should have never allowed them into the cell 
block. The city has denied any wrongdoing.

FIGURE IN BRAWL IS REVEALED AS A WOMAN;

IMPERSONATION: A 19-YEAR-OLD CREDITED WITH SAVING THE LIFE OF AMBER JEFFERSON 
IS TAKEN TO ORANGE COUNTY JAIL ON SUSPICION OF BURGLARY AND TURNS OUT TO BE

<P>
A 19-year-old who was credited with saving the life of a high school 
cheerleader during a highly publicized brawl four months ago is a woman who has 
been impersonating a man, sheriff's officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said investigators 
discovered Lewis Jones' true identity -- Teresa Jones of Anaheim -- on 
Wednesday after she was taken to Orange County Jail in Santa Ana on suspicion 
of burglary. 
</P>
<P>
He said Jones also goes by the names Louilla Jones and Louilla Martin. 
</P>
<P>
"It was confirmed by one of the female medical staff," Olson said. "We also 
confirmed it through fingerprint comparisons." 
</P>
<P>
Jones was among several people with Amber Jefferson, 15, of Garden Grove on the 
night of Aug. 6, when Amber's face was slashed during the brawl. Amber's 
parents, who have called the attack racially motivated, credited Jones with 
saving their daughter's life by holding her severely cut face together until 
paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Jones and three others were later charged in the brawl. Jones has pleaded not 
guilty to charges of malicious mischief, assault with a deadly weapon and 
fighting in public. 
</P>
<P>
The revelation that Jones is a woman stunned investigators, prosecutors -- even 
Jones' own attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a she, that's what they tell me," said Peter Haviland, who is 
representing Jones on the brawl charges. "I never knew." 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said it is too early to tell how the latest disclosure will affect 
the trial of Amber's alleged attacker, Kurt David Wimberly, 18, who is accused 
of throwing the glass that slashed her face. 
</P>
<P>
"It was new information to me, I can say that," Assistant Dist. Atty. Kathi 
Harper said. "But nothing in this case surprises me anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Jones was arrested Wednesday, along with a 16-year-old boy, in connection with 
a condominium burglary in the 9100 block of Cerritos Avenue in Stanton. 
Sheriff's officials said a condo in the complex was ransacked and about $1,600 
worth of property was taken. The complex is the same one where Amber was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Contacted Thursday, Amber's mother, Cody Donnelly, said she had heard rumors 
that Jones was a woman several months ago but discounted them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of us ever took it seriously," Donnelly said. "I asked 
(Jones' girlfriend) about it, and she denied it vehemently." 
</P>
<P>
Jones has also been charged with false impersonation and giving false 
information to a police officer, Olson said. She is being held in lieu of 
$25,000 bail.

SWITCH WOULD LIMIT PLAY OF CITY, SOUTHERN SECTION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal by the Los Angeles Unified School District to move its winter high 
school athletic programs to fall would limit participation between the City and 
Southern Section teams in nonleague competition, Southern Section Associate 
Commissioner Dean Crowley said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The district begins a year-round school schedule on July 1, 1991, but fewer 
than 10 of the district's 49 high schools will be open all year. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining schools will follow a new calendar, with the majority closed from 
late December until mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the 1991 winter sports season would begin in late September 
or early October and finish by the end of December. The move would affect 
wrestling and boys' and girls' basketball and soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Several City teams now participate in nonleague basketball tournaments with 
Southern Section teams in December. A switch to fall would mean City teams 
would instead be playing in their league and section championships at that 
time. 
</P>
<P>
And at the beginning of the City season, winter teams in the Southern Section 
would not even have begun practicing yet. 
</P>
<P>
"The only ones they (City teams) would have left to play against are 
themselves," Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Harkness, the City Section commissioner, said the City will ask the 
California Interscholastic Federation to allow teams to continue participating 
in the state basketball and wrestling tournaments. Harkness said the seven-week 
break "certainly wouldn't help" in tournament play. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Byrnes, CIF commissioner, said City participation in the tournaments likely 
will be discussed at the state federation's council meeting February in 
Sacramento. MIKE REILLEY

November from a year earlier, the California Assn. of Realtors reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But the dip, while sizable, was the county's smallest for any month -- in a 
year-to-year comparison -- since February, when sales were down 10% over the 
same month in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
It also gave Orange County -- which led the Southland into the current housing 
slump in late 1988 -- the best performance in November in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Resales last month declined 34.3% in San Diego County, 33.5% in Los Angeles 
County, 29.7% in the Riverside-San Bernardino area and 17.9% in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
The median resale price of a single-family home in Orange County rose 2.4% last 
month to $231,250 from $225,840 a year earlier, maintaining the county's 
position as one of the state's highest-priced housing markets. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the association reported, resales of single-family homes were down 
27.4% from a year earlier.

PRESIDENT RESIGNS FROM MEDSTONE INTERNATIONAL; 
</P>
<P>
TECHNOLOGY: THE FIRM HAS FAILED TO WIN FEDERAL APPROVAL OF ITS EQUIPMENT TO 
REMOVE GALLSTONES.

<P>
A month after suspending efforts to win federal approval for equipment to 
remove gallstones, Medstone International Inc. announced Thursday that its 
president and chief operating officer has resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Ferrari, who joined the company in April, resigned to pursue other 
interests, the company said. His resignation comes less than seven weeks after 
the company's founder and chairman, Freeman Rose, left the company in November. 
</P>
<P>
Rose formed Medstone in October, 1984, to produce and market equipment known as 
lithotripters, sophisticated shock-wave devices used to shatter kidney stones 
and gallstones without surgery. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the company announced it had given up on efforts to obtain Food 
and Drug Administration approval to use its lithotripters for gallstone 
procedures. The scientific community had raised questions about the 
effectiveness of the machines for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"The recent suspension of the gallstone lithotripsy program reduced the scope 
of Medstone's shock-wave-therapy business, and prompted me to pursue other 
personal growth opportunities," Ferrari said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrari, a former executive vice president of ADAC Laboratories in Milpitas, 
replaced acting president Jack Olshansky in April as president and chief 
operating officer. He assumed the duties of chief executive after Rose gave up 
the title in July. Ferrari could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
David V. Radlinski, executive vice president and chief financial officer of the 
company, said Ferrari will be replaced internally in January from among members 
of the executive staff. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent setbacks, Radlinski said the company would continue to 
market its technology for use in destroying kidney stones and attempt to shift 
away from its dependence on medical capital equipment markets toward the larger 
health-care business. 
</P>
<P>
"We have $10 million and opportunities in different technologies," Radlinski 
said. "No decisions have been made about future investments." 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock closed Thursday at $1.25, down 12.5 cents in 
over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, the company reported a loss of $2.3 
million on revenue of $1.7 million, compared with a loss of $1.6 million on 
revenue of $1.2 million. The loss reflected heavy competition for the company's 
products, Radlinski said.

O.C. BRIEFLY: SILICON SYSTEMS FILES LAWSUIT OVER ITS PATENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Silicon Systems Inc. said Thursday that it has sued a San Jose computer chip 
company for alleged infringement of two patents covering technology that 
governs recovery of data in computer disk drives. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Jurick, senior vice president of corporate planning for Silicon Systems, 
said the suit filed in federal court in Los Angeles accuses Exar Corp. of 
copying the patented circuitry of the firm's SSI 32D532 data recovery product. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Melendrez, Exar's senior corporate counsel, declined comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The data recovery product, a chip that costs less than $10, is widely used in a 
computer's hard disk drives. It governs the process in which a reading device 
retrieves data on magnetic media, amplifies the signal and extracts the data in 
a code the computer can understand. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a large sales volume item for our company," Jurick said.

NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: UNINCORPORATED AREAS WITHIN YORBA LINDA : CLIPBOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By April Jackson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in 1858, when Don Bernardo Yorba willed a plot of land to the Catholic 
Church for a cemetery, he could never have envisioned the sprawling residential 
growth that would encircle the graves of his friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
Yorba Cemetery sits parallel to a tennis court on a quiet plateau overlooking 
the Riverside Freeway. The ruffle of leaves, driven by Santa Ana winds, muffles 
the constant whirring of traffic below. Packed-in homes cover small lots, while 
wooden fences buy a few feet of privacy for each yard. The only cinder block 
wall in this area runs the distance from Esperanza Road to Yorba Linda 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
This safe, quiet neighborhood -- Fairlynn Estates and the Yorba Linda Country 
Club enclave -- suffer few problems, save one embroiling issue: incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what they have against incorporation," said Glen Yasui, a senior 
administrative assistant in the Yorba Linda city manager's office. "They'd get 
better services, like faster police response, better street-sweeping and better 
representation of their interests." 
</P>
<P>
Incorporation battles aren't new to Yorba Linda. The first one started 32 years 
ago over a fear that the city would be annexed to Brea. Year after year, 
petitions to incorporate failed. And in the early 1960s, the Board of 
Supervisors decided that owners of more than 50% of the assessed value of local 
property were opposed to annexation plans. But supporters disagreed with the 
board's findings, saying that the values of their opponents' land holdings had 
been miscalculated. The fight between the two factions went all the way to the 
California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The court overturned the board's decision and allowed an incorporation election 
to take place. In 1967, the city of Yorba Linda was created by a vote of 1,963 
to 638. The name is a hybrid of the Yorba name and the Spanish word for pretty. 
However, the Fairlynn Estates property and the country club area were not 
included within the new city's boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time a petition for incorporation starts around again," Yasui said, "the 
rabble-rousers get out there and start up with their talk about how expensive 
it would be to incorporate and city taxes. It's always money." 
</P>
<P>
Yorba Linda would like to incorporate both pieces of land, but Fairlynn Estates 
actually poses a cost-prohibitive problem. According to the city planning 
office, improvements to a public works project running beneath the Fairlynn 
Estates land would have to be completed before the city would consider 
incorporation of that area. 
</P>
<P>
Problems with the land surrounding Yorba Linda Country Club are 
people-generated. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care for the idea of incorporation at the least," said a 70-something 
oldtimer who would identify himself only as John Doe. "I don't mind people 
knowing who I am or speaking out about how I feel. It's just that . . . at my 
age, I don't want to get into any long harangues. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sheriff's Department handles our police calls and they do a great job. My 
kids went to good schools. We have paved roads, horse trails and a great golf 
course. The biggest issue at stake has been some need for a new 
street-sweeper." 
</P>
<P>
From his front yard, a western view of the county stretched across the canyon, 
revealing layers of tract housing encroaching upon the luxurious hillside 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want this neighborhood to become like that down there," John Doe said. 
"Every house and yard looks different (here). That's what I'm afraid of losing. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first moved here, some days we could see Catalina Island; not anymore. 
But this is still like living out in the country; the air is clean and a horse 
trail runs through the city. People living out here have country in their 
blood." 
</P>
<P>
The other John Does of unincorporated Yorba Linda also share a sense of Don 
Bernardo Yorba's love of the land. Unfortunately, the concrete reminders of the 
area's founder -- Yorba's home, chapel and a school -- have fallen to 
development. 
</P>
<P>
A California Historical Landmark now stands where Yorba had built the largest 
hacienda in Southern California, Rancho San Antonio. Built in 1834, the 
two-story, 50-room adobe building was located at the corner of current-day 
Esperanza Road and Echo Hill Drive. Today, a small monument is the sole 
indicator of the rancho that was razed in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
The marker for Yorba's chapel and school is located off Esperanza Road near 
Echo Hill Drive. As each building fell into disrepair, it was torn down. As 
recently as 1958, the old church was demolished. All that is left standing of 
Yorba's legacy is his own tombstone. 
</P>
<P>
A wrought-iron fence encloses the oldest private cemetery in Orange County, 
predated only by the Mission Cemetery in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Gates to the cemetery,located off Esperanza Road, are locked to deter vandals. 
But several headstones of Orange County's earliest pioneer families -- 
including the Valencias and the Peraltas -- lay fallen on the rich, dark soil 
in apparent acts of vandalism. And just as the tombstones topple, so do the 
hills of Santa Ana Canyon fall to development.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER TAKES HARD LINE ON IRAQ

<TEXT>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major said today that Iraqi troops will have to be 
"forcibly removed" from Kuwait if President Saddam Hussein does not agree to 
withdraw them peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
Major, just as unyielding in talking about Hussein as was his predecessor, 
Margaret Thatcher, rejected the notion that a partial Iraqi pullback from 
Kuwait would help bring about a solution to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"A complete withdrawal is necessary, a partial withdrawal won't do," Major said 
in a display of solidarity with U.S. policy on the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
On the gulf issue at least, Major's remarks augured well for his talks with 
President Bush late in the day at Camp David, the Maryland presidential retreat 
where the two leaders were planning an overnight stay. 
</P>
<P>
Major, who arrived here Thursday night for a 40-hour visit, wasted no time in 
going on a rhetorical offensive against Hussein, using a succession of four 
television interviews aired shortly after dawn. 
</P>
<P>
"If he stays in Kuwait, in a country which essentially at the moment is rather 
like a prison camp, a country that he's dismantling day after day, then he will 
have to be forcibly removed," Major said. "I hope it won't come to that -- 
everyone hopes it won't come to that -- but it could." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Major demonstrated the kinder, gentler face he has brought to 
British politics since his accession, showing none of the abrasiveness that was 
a Thatcher hallmark. In contrast to Thatcher, he was polite to reporters 
questioning him. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing Major and Thatcher, one U.S. official said, "The biggest change is 
personal style." 
</P>
<P>
Consistent with the U.S. view on the gulf, Major said: "There is nothing 
whatsoever to negotiate about." Hussein, he said, "has to go."

FLURRIES AT BEACH CITIES A RARE EVENT

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was snowing in Surf City this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Some light flakes, spawned by a frigid upper-level storm system, also drifted 
onto neighboring Seal Beach. Weather forecasters said the snow will end today 
-- the first day of winter -- but the cold will continue and become even colder 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual snow in the Seal Beach-Huntington Beach area was very light, very 
scattered and did not stick. But the sight of the tiny flakes blowing in the 
cold ocean wind caused excitement and wonder. 
</P>
<P>
Civic Center workers in Huntington Beach exchanged snow stories. 
</P>
<P>
Children ran outside their homes and cheered, according to one resident in the 
northern section of this city of 180,000. 
</P>
<P>
Snow flurries were also reported this morning in Costa Mesa and along the 
Ortega Highway at elevations of 1,800 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The rare event for the beach cities was all the more remarkable, observers 
said, because Huntington Beach, a historic surfing mecca, usually advertises 
itself as a balmy, sun-drenched coastal resort. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of sun-tanned bodies on the beach, city lifeguards this morning 
were reporting a light frosting of snowflakes on cars and streets near the 
city's famed pier. 
</P>
<P>
"I was down at the Grinder (on Pacific Coast Highway) having breakfast this 
morning, and when I came out, I thought someone was having a dandruff problem," 
said Kai Weisser, 31, a marine safety officer. 
</P>
<P>
"There was snow on the ground. It was a very small amount, but it was 
definitely snow. This was about quarter after nine this morning. I've lived 
here since I was 4 years old, and I couldn't believe it. I've seen hail here 
before, but never snow." 
</P>
<P>
Snow was seen in Seal Beach between 8:30 a.m. and 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked outside, and I have a dark sweater on and there were a bunch of white 
things on it," said Kerry Kyle, a receptionist at Seal Beach City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"There were little white snowflakes out there," said Suzi Henricks, a waitress 
at Ruby's on the end of the Seal Beach pier. 
</P>
<P>
The light snow came as an upper-atmosphere low pressure system continued to 
buffet Southern California with unusually cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist with WeatherData, Inc., which provides weather 
information for The Times, said this morning that the upper-atmosphere system 
has been circulating frigid air from Canada and the Arctic southward into 
Southern California for the past two days. He said the cold weather is 
predicted to continue for the next two days and will likely get even colder as 
clouds dissipate. But he said he sees little chance for more precipitation, 
including snow, except in the mountain areas of the state. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a pretty cold situation we're having, so I'm not surprised that snow 
turned up in some weird spot like Huntington Beach," Dittmann said. "There's 
also been some snow today in Ontario." 
</P>
<P>
Dittmann noted that clouds have been hovering over Orange County and that those 
clouds have helped keep ground heat from dissipating. But Dittmann said the 
forecast calls for the clouds to move out. This will mean colder temperatures 
this weekend, perhaps in the teens or low 20s in some areas.

SKUNK WORKS CREATOR DIES AT 80 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clarence L. (Kelly) Johnson, creator of Lockheed Corp.'s secret Skunk Works 
aircraft factory and a leading designer of the U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird spy 
planes, died today. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson died at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank after an illness of many 
years, a Lockheed statement said. The illness was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson organized the Skunk Works in 1943 to build the XP-80 Shooting Star, the 
United States' first production jet fighter. 
</P>
<P>
Many aircraft and spacecraft bore his mark: the P-38 Lightning in World War II, 
the Constellation transports, the Hercules cargo planes, the P2V antisubmarine 
patrol aircraft and the Agena spacecraft, among others.

SNOW USHERS IN WINTER -- EVEN WHERE LIFE'S A BEACH 
</P>

<P>
Winter made an authentic entrance into Southern California today, as a massive 
Arctic weather system scattered light snow along the oceanfront from the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula to San Clemente and temperatures dropped to near freezing 
throughout the metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
Snowfall in mountains farther inland was considerably heavier and forced 
closure of Interstate 5 near Gorman, where drifts up to a foot deep were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol said the storm triggered numerous accidents in 
the area and dozens of vehicles were stuck in ice and snow. 
</P>
<P>
The snow along the coastline began at about 8 a.m. and melted almost 
immediately, but not before it had startled commuters accustomed to balmier 
weather. In San Pedro, residents reported morning flurries that lasted up to 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service said there was a chance of more flurries in the 
metropolitan area this afternoon, most likely in foothill communities such as 
La Crescenta, La Canada-Flintridge and Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters said the frigid, blustery conditions were caused by a huge, 
slow-moving low-pressure system that by now is blanketing the western half of 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"The cold air has been spilling down out of the Arctic like heavy syrup, oozing 
slowly south into the United States," said Rick Dittmann, a forecaster with 
WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. "It's been cold, and 
it's staying cold." 
</P>
<P>
Today is the winter solstice. Winter begins officially at 7:07 p.m.

A part-time Santa Claus has been charged with fondling a 14-year-old girl at a 
shopping mall, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
John Solyst, 27, a teacher's aide who also works seasonally as a Santa Claus, 
was charged with a fourth-degree sex offense for allegedly touching the girl's 
breasts and buttocks while she was posing for a group photograph with five 
friends and Santa. Her parents reported the incident, which allegedly took 
place Dec. 7, leading to Solyst's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa was released on his own recognizance and told to be in court Jan. 22.

IRAQIS POUR OUT OF BAGHDAD IN CIVIL DEFENSE EXERCISE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Air raid sirens blared and about 1 million Iraqis carrying blankets and food 
streamed out of Baghdad early today in an evacuation drill to test the nation's 
readiness for war. 
</P>
<P>
During the drill many Iraqis stayed home, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
Participants ran on foot to civil defense centers or sped out of town in cars. 
Hundreds of buses waiting at centers took Iraqis to shelters north, east and 
south of Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Roads leading out of the capital were jammed with thousands of cars, trucks, 
buses and even carriages pulled by tractors. The drill began at 7 a.m. and 
ended five hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been preparing for war since the U.N. Security Council authorized 
force to remove Iraq from Kuwait if it does not leave the emirate by Jan. 15. 
Iraqi media carry instructions for building bomb shelters and courses in civil 
defense and first-aid. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have suggested that Iraq's cities could be bombed heavily in the 
event of war. 
</P>
<P>
The evacuation drill today was conducted for the half of Baghdad that lies on 
the east bank of the Tigris River, but only about 1 million of the 2 million 
residents participated, said residents, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
A second exercise Saturday will cover west Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Basra, Iraq's second-largest city with a million people, was evacuated in a 
similar exercise Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported that Iraq is trying to buy 
a large number of gas masks in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted an official newspaper in Abu Dhabi as saying Iraq had ordered gas 
masks from companies in Germany, Belgium, and Britain in recent weeks. It said 
the firms have not filled the orders.

U.S. BOWS TO ARABS IN U.N., ISRAELI SAYS

Israel's foreign minister said today the United States showed weakness in 
catering to Arab desires for a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning 
Israel, but Iraq dismissed the measure as "meager." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, approved in a 15-0 vote of the council Thursday, urges Israel 
to stop deporting Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza and calls on the 
United Nations to monitor the security of Palestinians in the region. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. support of the resolution was seen as an effort to preserve an Arab 
coalition against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. It was the third time in two 
months that Washington has failed to exercise its veto power to shield Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said today that the United States has 
succumbed to Arab pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a weakness among the Americans that is brought about by America's 
dependency on the anti-Saddam coalition and by the American obsession that if 
it is objective and stands by Israel, the coalition is liable to be weakened," 
Levy told Israel army radio. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Iraqi officials criticized the wording of the resolution as too 
weak. 
</P>
<P>
The vote "highlighted the double standards applied by the United States and 
imposed on the Security Council, which has turned into a tool manipulated by 
the United States," Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz said. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials complained that the action would not be sufficient to 
protect residents of the Israeli-held territories because it does not mention 
the international conference or specify what steps should be taken to safeguard 
the Palestinians.

SPORTS JOURNAL TO BOOST ITS DAILY PRICE TO 75 CENTS

<P>
The National, the financially struggling daily sports newspaper, said today it 
plans to boost its daily cover price by a quarter to 75 cents, effective Jan. 
21. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the newspaper said it will test a $1 daily price in one or two of 
its 10 metropolitan editions. 
</P>
<P>
It has not yet decided which ones, spokesman Steve Hammond said. 
</P>
<P>
In taking the action, the newspaper said it is following the lead of several 
other media companies, including the Wall Street Journal and the New York 
Times, that have recently either boosted prices or plan to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper companies across the country have been looking for ways to stimulate 
revenue growth as demand from advertisers has softened along with the general 
retrenchment in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
But boosting the cover price may be particularly risky for The National, which 
has fallen short of its circulation targets.

To beat the lack of heat, some dairy farmers are using cow brassieres and hair 
dryers to keep their animals from udderly freezing. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to try to keep a cold cow comfortable, or you're going to lose a 
lot of milk production," said Barry Steevens, a University of Missouri dairy 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Today's forecast called for highs around zero. 
</P>
<P>
Some Missouri farmers use nylon mesh udder supports on animals that calved 
recently and have udders swollen with milk, Steevens said. Others use hair 
dryers and towels to keep moisture off the animals.

News of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's resignation sent the 
Tokyo stock market tumbling today while strengthening the dollar against the 
Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
Stock traders said Shevardnadze's surprise announcement Thursday shook the 
stock market with worries about domestic turmoil in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The market also was rocked by rumors, later denied, that Iraq is planning to 
pull its troops out of Kuwait, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"Since yesterday, there was also a technical correction," said Haruo Ueno, 
manager of stock trading at Wako Securities. 
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed 351.84 points 
Thursday, lost another 405.34 points, or 1.6%, to close at 24,119.06. Trading 
was moderate at 350 million shares.

British Aerospace PLC is considering a rival bid for Boeing Co.'s De Havilland 
division, currently the subject of sales talks, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Financial Post, British Aerospace wants to acquire De 
Havilland for its technology and later sell the facility to a French and 
Italian consortium, Avions de Transport Regional. 
</P>
<P>
Boeing signed a letter of intent in July to sell De Havilland directly to the 
French and Italian companies who are partners in the consortium, Aerospatiale 
SA and Aeritalia SpA. Talks between the parties are ongoing, but no deal has 
yet been announced. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials said British Aerospace is interested in studying De Havilland's 
short takeoff and landing technology and in incorporating it into its own 
commuter aircraft.

DOW GAINS 4.20, UNFAZED BY 'TRIPLE WITCHING HOUR'

Stock prices drifted higher today amid strong cross-currents created by a 
quarterly "triple witching hour." 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 4.20 at 2,633.66, bringing its gain 
for the week to 39.85 points. Losses led gainers by an 8-7 margin. 
</P>
<P>
New York Stock Exchange volume was unusually heavy at 233.40 million shares but 
the upturn in activity stemmed from the expiration at the close of the December 
stock index futures, futures options, index options and options on individual 
stocks, the so-called "triple witching hour." 
</P>
<P>
The witching hour, which falls on the third Friday of March, June, September 
and December, was often a turbulent occasion for the market in years past. But 
recently it has been taking place in more orderly style. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was heavy at the outset as professional investors engaged in maneuvers 
involving a group of expiring options and futures on stock indexes. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those contracts were settled on the basis of opening stock prices this 
morning, and others as of the close. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that specialized activity, analysts mostly saw an uneventful session, 
with many investors getting an early start on Christmas holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a nothing day," said Thom Czech, head of the investment committee 
at Blunt Ellis &amp; Loewi. "The internals of the market are not that strong, 
with declines still ahead of advances." 
</P>
<P>
The markets will be open Monday for an abbreviated session ending at 2 p.m. 
EST, instead of the usual 4 p.m. close. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp., said cyclical 
stocks that are sensitive to the state of the economy were performing better. 
</P>
<P>
"That's telling you the market is starting to feel a little more upbeat about 
1991," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Merck &amp; Co. rose 1 5/8 to 87 3/4 after the company said it has developed 
and started human clinical testing of its first compound for fighting the AIDS 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
Desoto Inc., the maker of industrial products, said the steep drop in its share 
price reflected an $11.50 a share payment to shareholders. Desoto fell 11 1/4 
to 8 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
A Prudential-Bache analyst said she raised her rating on Intergraph Corp., the 
computer graphics company, to "buy" from "hold." Intergraph added 1/2 to 14.

The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was down 3/8 point, or $3.75 per $1,000 
in face amount, around midday. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, was up 
to 8.26% from 8.23% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the key long bond was up about 1/8 point, but economists said the 
subsequent decline was unrelated to external events and reflected the whims of 
a sparsely traded market. Prices remained relatively stable in narrow ranges.

Indianapolis Colts owner Robert Irsay said today that Coach Ron Meyer will 
return for the 1991 season, but other changes in the coaching staff will be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
Irsay delivered the vote of confidence in his head coach after speculation this 
season that Meyer would be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts, 6-8, still have an outside shot at the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron will be here next year," Irsay said. "He has a contract for next year and 
we're going to keep him. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to make some other changes, which we won't know until after (Jan. 
1)," Irsay said. 
</P>
<P>
Meyer took over at the end of the 1986 season, leading the team to three 
victories after it lost its first 13 games. The Colts won the AFC East with a 
9-6 mark in the strike-shortened 1987 season, and had 9-7 and 8-8 marks the 
last two seasons.

<P>
Three-time Formula One champion Alain Prost, who had been thinking of quitting 
auto racing, extended his contract with the Italian team Ferrari through 1992, 
racing sources reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrari officials did not immediately confirm the report, but a communique from 
the team about Prost is expected in a few days. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrari, which is owned by the Italian auto giant Fiat of Turin, held an option 
on the 35-year-old French driver through 1991. 
</P>
<P>
But Prost, embittered by the loss of this year's world title after a 
controversial crash with Brazilian rival Ayrton Senna during the Japanese Grand 
Prix, had said recently that he was uncertain whether to continue racing.

Pitchers Lance McCullers of Detroit, John Cerutti of Toronto, Jeff Musselman of 
the New York Mets and Pat Clements of San Diego were among 13 players who 
became free agents today when their teams did not offer them contracts for 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
Under the collective bargaining agreement between the players union and the 26 
clubs, all players on 40-man rosters must be offered contracts by Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Those who are not automatically become free agents who may sign with any team 
without any restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Among the new free agents is pitcher Terry Wells, who had little success during 
a short stint in the Dodgers' starting rotation last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics and the Pittsburgh Pirates each allowed three players to 
become free agents. The A's did not offer contracts to pitchers Jim Corsi and 
Dave Otto and outfielder Steve Howard, while Pittsburgh did not offer contracts 
to catcher Dann Bilardello, outfielder John Cangelosi and first baseman Scott 
Little. 
</P>
<P>
Also becoming free agents were pitchers Tom Edens of Milwaukee and Gary Eaves 
of San Francisco.

Oprah Winfrey is giving $50,000 to Glide Memorial United Methodist Church, 
which appealed for help in its holiday grocery giveaway to the poor, the church 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Because she is a very caring person who reaches out to the poor, she 
immediately responded," the Rev. Cecil Williams, the church's pastor, said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Glide Memorial has distributed thousands of bags of groceries to the poor since 
1979. But Williams reported earlier this week that holiday contributions were 
down 37% from 1989 and asked the public for donations. 
</P>
<P>
Winfrey learned of the appeal through poet Maya Angelou, a member of Glide 
Memorial, and called Williams to say she will be sending a check, the church 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The church planned to start its holiday giveaway of more than 10,000 bags of 
groceries today. The church said that while donations have declined, the need 
for the groceries has risen.

THE FLASH;

ACTOR SEEKS SUBSTANCE UNDER HERO'S SURFACE

<P>
When he was cast in the CBS series "The Flash," John Wesley Shipp said he had 
second thoughts about playing a fantasy superhero in bright tights. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the issues I wanted to address before I took the job was how much time 
he spent out of the costume," said Shipp, who was selected from about 50 actors 
who auditioned. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first heard about 'The Flash,' I said, 'No thanks.' I thought I'd just 
be running around in a union suit. But they are taking the character of Barry 
Allen, his alter ego, very seriously, so there is something in it for me as an 
actor. It has a fantasy element, but we also try to deal with social issues. 
We've done shows about drug addiction and the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the attraction of the CBS show is the fantasy of the Flash's 
incredible speed -- and the startling special effects that make it look real. 
</P>
<P>
"The Flash" comic book made its first appearance in January, 1940, but never 
achieved the fame or the appeal of such comic book classics as "Superman" and 
"Batman" and disappeared by 1950. 
</P>
<P>
It was revived -- and modernized -- in 1956, and the CBS series is based on 
that version. A third incarnation is currently running in comic books. 
</P>
<P>
"The Flash" is also Barry Allen, a young scientist who comes from a family of 
Irish policemen. Allen's father is none too happy that he hasn't also become a 
policeman. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things I liked is that when Barry gets the super powers in a 
laboratory accident, his first reaction isn't, 'OK, I'm going to save the 
world,' " Shipp said. "He goes to another scientist, played by Amanda Pays, and 
asks her what it means. He worries that it might mean premature aging. He 
decides to use the powers after his policeman brother is killed." 
</P>
<P>
Shipp said he thinks some comic book characters have been treated in a 
ludicrous manner by television. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to create a world of your own," he said. "You can't put a guy in a 
red suit with wings on his head on Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want 'The Flash' to become a vigilante. I don't want him to abuse the 
power. I'm after the writers to explore its effects on Barry. Some people just 
want to make it the good guys versus the bad guys." 
</P>
<P>
The show is expensive: The pilot cost $6.5 million, and each episode costs $1.4 
million, Shipp said. 
</P>
<P>
A great deal of the technical wizardry goes into making superhuman speed look 
authentic. 
</P>
<P>
"We walk a thin line between something that can be sophisticated and something 
that can be laughable," Shipp said. 
</P>
<P>
"We do a lot of night shooting. We use a lot of wet streets and reflected 
lights. You have to be careful how you use the suit. To me, it has to be used 
as a visual effect. It has to be carefully lit and photographed." 
</P>
<P>
The look of "The Flash" is a mixture of vintage styles with the 1990s, 
completely omitting the 1960s, '70s and '80s. The wardrobes combine long coats 
and fedoras from the 1930s with contemporary clothes. The vehicles are from the 
'30s, '40s, '50s and '90s. 
</P>
<P>
The look of speed comes from an unusual smear effect. It requires a long 
exposure of the main scene and a second film in which Shipp recreates his 
movements exactly in front of a blue screen. The two images then are combined 
on digital videotape to give the appearance he's moving at 600 m.p.h. while 
everyone else is moving at normal speed. 
</P>
<P>
The special suit Shipp wears is a type of body appliance that gives him an 
imposing, heavily muscled appearance. It's in 30 pieces and takes about 30 
minutes to put on. And it's so hot that it's equipped with a cooling system. 
</P>
<P>
Before beginning "The Flash," Shipp played the father in the sequel to the film 
"The NeverEnding Story." He also worked in such soap operas as "The Guiding 
Light," "As the World Turns" and "Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
"The sequel takes the father-son relationship further," he said of "The 
NeverEnding Story." 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny. In that father-son relationship, I was the father. In 'The Flash,' 
I'm the son in the father-son relationship. The actor in 'The NeverEnding 
Story' who plays my son, Jonathan Brandes, plays a street kid in a 'Flash' 
episode."

LIZ SMITH: JAPANESE ELECTRONICS COMPANIES PLUG INTO HOLLYWOOD

<TEXT>
<P>
PEOPLE ARE talking about two Hollywood stories, one in the Wall Street Journal, 
the other in M Inc. Both deal with Sony of Japan's U.S. company, Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
The WSJ asks if Columbia's Tri-Star production of "Hook" (the tale of Peter Pan 
grown up) will fly. 
</P>
<P>
CAA, which represents Steve Spielberg, Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams, the 
principals, made a deal that means its clients will get roughly 40% of the 
gross of this movie plus a percentage of all the merchandising as well. "Hook" 
will have to sell $125 million worth of tickets to break even. 
</P>
<P>
Why did Tri-Star give away the store on this one, set for Christmas release in 
1991? Because Tri-Star's dynamic Mike Medavoy believes "everyone is going to 
make money." Reporter Laura Landro quotes another exec who says: "They made a 
strategic decision to show that they could be in business with a director and 
stars of this caliber, no matter what the cost. . . . But it could give them 
enormous credibility." 
</P>
<P>
Then, there is M's article by Russell Miller, "Star Struck! Has Hollywood 
Hustled the Japanese?" There is some necessary rehash here in the story, the 
tale of how Jon Peters and Peter Guber won the top spot to run Columbia, and 
the magazine comments, "The big electronics companies are banking on movies to 
sell their hardware. What they didn't count on were the spending habits of guys 
like Guber and Peters." 
</P>
<P>
Russell says Guber and Peters have gone underground. Knowing their Sony bosses 
don't like all the publicity, "two of the fastest talkers in Hollywood are 
suddenly overcome by shyness and a desire to avoid the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
All requests for interviews are refused, it being 'too premature' for them to 
speak about their plans. Family and friends are warned not to speak."

Entertainer Wayne Newton's failure to submit a plan for restoring an 
erosion-damaged stream on his 241-acre Lake Tahoe retreat will cost him 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Las Vegas showman also must post a $150,000 bond for missing a May deadline 
for submitting the improvement plans, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The bistate agency decided Wednesday to extend the deadline for submitting the 
land restoration plan until March 1 but also required the fee and the bond. 
He'll get the bond back once the work is done. 
</P>
<P>
Newton acquired the scenic property in 1985 for $2.5 million.
