MAX GRUNDIG; RADIO, TELEVISION PIONEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Max Grundig, 81, the radio and television pioneer whose electronics company 
grew from a small shop to a worldwide enterprise. Grundig began tinkering with 
radios as a 15-year-old apprentice in the Bavarian city of Nuremberg. He opened 
his own shop with a friend in 1930, selling radios and producing transformers. 
After World War II, Grundig was permitted by the Allies to relocate his 
business to Fuerth, where he set up his own factory to produce radio parts. His 
company was one of the first to produce frequency modulated (FM) radios, 
cutting out static interference for clearer reception. In 1952, Grundig was one 
of the first European companies to start producing TV sets. During the 1960s, 
Grundig began setting up foreign branches. But Grundig's market share came 
under increasing pressure in the late 1970s from cheaper Japanese products, and 
in 1980 the company suffered its first losses. Grundig was forced to close 11 
plants and cut its work force from 35,000 to 29,000. In 1984, the Dutch Philips 
group bought nearly a one-third share and took over the management. The firm, 
which still bears his name, has annual sales of more than $1.7 billion. In 
Baden-Baden, West Germany, on Dec. 8 of unannounced causes.

MOTORCYCLIST CHARGED IN BONITA DEATH OF JOGGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The motorcyclist linked to the death of a jogger along Sweetwater Road in 
Bonita on Nov. 5 has been charged with one count of vehicular manslaughter and 
two counts of driving under the influence of alcohol, the district attorney's 
office said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Rossi, a 29-year-old Chula Vista resident, was on a late-afternoon 
jog when she was struck head-on by a motorcycle allegedly operated by a man who 
was uninsured and not licensed to operate a motorcycle. The case has stirred 
controversy because the California Highway Patrol allowed Jerald Covey, 29, to 
go to a hospital unaccompanied by officers, and he later walked out. 
</P>
<P>
Covey was not given a blood-alcohol test until "two or three hours" after the 
accident, according to CHP officials. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on the charges, all felonies, Covey could be sentenced to a 
maximum of four years in state prison, a district attorney's spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Rossi's husband of 10 years, Tom, said he is not completely satisfied with the 
district attorney's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty happy, but I was wishing for some stronger charges," he said. "When 
you have had problems with some of your evidence, that's the best that you can 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Rockwell, the attorney representing Covey, called it "a most tragic 
accident and obviously my client feels terrible about it . . . but obviously I 
don't think that Mr. Covey is guilty of what he's charged, and we will 
successfully defend him." 
</P>
<P>
Rossi, 33, blames the CHP for "messing up" the case in the beginning, but he 
said the Highway Patrol has compensated by putting extra effort into the case. 
</P>
<P>
Covey "had better get some time in jail," said Rossi, who now takes care of 
their three children, sons 8 and 6, and a daughter, 3. "To me it's the same as 
walking out with a gun and killing someone if he just gets probation." 
</P>
<P>
"At least I can go through Christmas a little bit better now because he's been 
charged," said Rossi. "Two months is a long time. I'm getting over it now, a 
little bit, but it was really frustrating at first." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Yackle, the deputy district attorney assigned to the case, declined to 
comment on any mishandling of the situation by the CHP, saying only that the 
CHP had "admitted that they wanted to have handled it better" and that "they 
did an excellent job of following up on the investigation." 
</P>
<P>
Blood-alcohol tests administered to Covey after the accident showed that he did 
have a blood-alcohol level above 0.10%, the level at which a driver is legally 
intoxicated, Yackle said. Yackle, however, declined to specify Covey's 
blood-alcohol level. 
</P>
<P>
The delay in taking a blood-alcohol test in the incident is "one factor that 
will have to be taken into account" in the trial, Yackle said. She refused, 
however, to say whether or not more serious charges could have been filed had 
the test been taken immediately after the accident, saying that to do so would 
be "pure guesswork." 
</P>
<P>
Covey will be arraigned Jan. 5 in South Bay Municipal Court.

ERA ENDS IN DEATH OF LAST FULL-BLOODED KWAAYMII 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last full-blooded Kwaaymii Indian, Tomas Lucas, 87, died Thursday on the 
land where his forebears had lived for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas was born during a snowstorm in 1903 in the same area of the Laguna 
Mountains in northeastern San Diego County where he died. He attended public 
school and later moved away from the reservation and married an Anglo woman. 
During World War II, he moved with his family to the Pacific Beach neighborhood 
of San Diego, working in defense industries and later for a San Diego building 
contractor. He retired at 70. 
</P>
<P>
About five years ago, he returned to the Lagunas, to the former Kwaaymii 
reservation land where he had been raised. 
</P>
<P>
The 320-acre Lucas Ranch was once the home of the tribe, who lived high in the 
Laguna Mountains most of the year, moving their entire village down to the 
desert during the coldest months of winter. 
</P>
<P>
During his final years, Lucas told and retold the story of his people to 
anthropologists and archeologists who visited his home off Sunrise Highway. His 
voice took on a sing-song quality as he repeated the legends that had been 
taught him as a youth, stories of the abundance of nature and the heroic deeds 
of his ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
The Kwaaymii elders, aware that he was the last of the tribe, forced the young 
members to learn and repeat the tribal history, and in recent years Lucas, 
despite failing hearing and eyesight, repeated it hundreds of times to 
educators and scientists who sought him out. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that I'm the only one today that remembers the past," he told a 
reporter last year. "I was the only child and no kids to play with. At night, I 
was bound to listen. Listen to stories, listen to prayers. 
</P>
<P>
"By keeping my ears open, as I most generally have, I picked up quite a few 
things. Some things I wasn't supposed to know I heard anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Children of Spencer Valley School near Julian and their teacher, Luanne Lynch, 
often visited Lucas to hear his tales. Lynch, with the aid of a school video 
camera, captured hours of Lucas' monologues and calls them "invaluable" because 
of his clear memory and voice. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas told of his people being decimated by white men's diseases -- scarlet 
fever and influenza -- and of being driven off their lands by settlers seeking 
rangeland for their cattle. 
</P>
<P>
When Lucas was born in 1903, the Kwaaymii no longer made the journey down to 
the desert in winter for fear that white ranchers would seize their mountain 
lands while they were away. But Lucas could point out the trail down the 
mountain to Mason Valley that his ancestors took and would describe the pile of 
tiny pebbles that grew to a mound because each passing Indian would toss on a 
stone to ask the Great Spirit for a safe journey. 
</P>
<P>
His land contains the site of a Kwaaymii village whose residents were wiped out 
in some mysterious way. Lucas speculated to a reporter that the mass deaths 
were from food poisoning, ptomaine probably, caused from some contamination in 
a communal meal. 
</P>
<P>
There are metate holes that Indian women, including his mother, used to grind 
acorns into meal. There are meadows where deer and other game were plentiful 
and where yellow buttercups formed lush carpets in the spring after winter 
rains. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas' mother, Maria Alto, also lived in both the Indian and Anglo worlds, 
becoming an accomplished horsewoman, an artist and a successful cattle rancher. 
She fought to have her son enrolled in a "white school," where he could learn 
English and receive an education. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas' daughter, Carmen, said her father fought for 18 years to obtain title to 
the Kwaaymii lands, which were his right as the last surviving member of the 
tribe. She said the deed of patent was finally approved by Congress and signed 
by then-President Harry Truman in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
In his final days, Lucas contracted pneumonia, Carmen Lucas said. 
</P>
<P>
"He knew he was dying. He told us so. He told us of his disturbing dreams where 
he was surrounded by angels, but when he reached out to touch them, their wings 
turned to paper," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Carmen Lucas and her sister, Jacquelyn Pfingst of San Diego, and three 
grandchildren survive him. 
</P>
<P>
His funeral services, like his life, will include Indian and Anglo elements. 
Tentative arrangements call for a visitation from noon until 8 p.m. Tuesday at 
Paris-Frederick Mortuary in El Cajon. His body will then be taken to Lucas 
Ranch, where an all-night wake is scheduled to begin at sunset Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Burial services are tentatively scheduled for 10 a.m. Thursday at the burial 
grounds on the Lucas Ranch, where his mother and more than 90 other Kwaaymii 
ancestors lie.

PLEA IS NOT GUILTY IN TRIPLE MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old boy who earlier this week was ordered to be tried as an adult for 
three murders in Clairemont pleaded not guilty Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Flores Jr. was ordered held in County Jail in lieu of $2 million bail by 
San Diego Municipal Judge H. Ronald Domnitz. 
</P>
<P>
Flores is one of two people charged in the Aug. 9 slayings of April Gilhousen, 
20; her son, Bryan, 3, and Kevin Chandler, 29, all of whom lived in the 
Clairemont house where they were killed. 
</P>
<P>
The co-defendant is Christopher Box, 20, a former football player and wrestler 
at Clairemont High School, who is awaiting a May 1 trial on the three murder 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
A Juvenile Court judge on Wednesday ordered that Flores, also a high school 
football player, be tried as an adult at the conclusion of a weeklong hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Domnitz ordered a Jan. 18 preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office has filed special circumstances allegations 
against Box and will seek the death penalty if he is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Special circumstances allegations cannot be filed against Flores because he was 
a minor at the time of the crime, even though he has been certified to be tried 
in adult court. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors claim the three were killed during a robbery that involved a 
marijuana sale.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STUDY GROUP BACKS NEW LIGHT RAIL LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An organization of local government officials and businesses recommended Friday 
that a light rail line be built linking Los Angeles' Mid-Wilshire area to 
Southwest Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the rail line would ease traffic congestion along the Crenshaw 
Boulevard corridor and provide a mass transit alternative to an area that is 
expected to see thousands of new jobs in the coming years, the Southern 
California Assn. of Governments said in its study. The cost of building the 
line and its exact route were not addressed by the group. 
</P>
<P>
The study researched the current and future transportation needs of the 
39-square-mile area, bounded by the Santa Monica Freeway to the north, the 
Harbor Freeway to the east, Imperial Highway to the south and the San Diego 
Freeway to the west.

EX-PROSECUTOR CONVICTED IN TRAFFIC DEATH SETTLES WITH VICTIM'S FAMILY FOR 
$225,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The children of an Escondido schoolteacher killed in a 1988 car crash have 
agreed to accept $225,000 to settle a lawsuit they brought against a former 
prosecutor who was driving while drunk and was convicted of manslaughter, a 
lawyer said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Benson's three children agreed to the deal Thursday, ending the suit they 
had filed against Charles Van Dusen, a former San Diego County deputy district 
attorney now serving a six-year prison term stemming from the Valley Center 
crash, said the children's lawyer, Joe B. Cordileone. 
</P>
<P>
The bargain was struck at a special conference conducted by a retired 
California appellate court judge, Edward T. Butler, Cordileone said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dusen agreed to pay $75,000 and his insurance companies the remaining 
$150,000, Cordileone said. Because the former prosecutor ended up paying a full 
one-third of the settlement, that "indicated he felt some remorse," Cordileone 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The children -- twins Catherine and Laura, 20, and Michael, 26 -- probably 
could have gotten more money if the wrongful-death suit had gone to trial in 
Vista Superior Court, where it had been filed, Cordileone said. But they agreed 
to the deal because it appeared to be the "most (money) they would likely 
recover without great difficulty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The crash took place Sept. 2, 1988. Benson, 45, was driving home for lunch on 
Cole Grade Road in Valley Center when Van Dusen, traveling about 90 m.p.h. in 
his Corvette, struck her car head-on. 
</P>
<P>
Benson died instantly. Van Dusen received minor injuries. His wife, Susan, a 
passenger in his car, was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the crash, Van Dusen's blood-alcohol level measured .20. A level 
of .10 means a person is legally intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
A former deputy district attorney in Vista who prosecuted many drunk-driving 
cases during his career, Van Dusen pleaded guilty in December, 1988, to 
vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, San Diego Municipal Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez sentenced Van 
Dusen to the six-year prison term, saying Van Dusen had a "longstanding alcohol 
problem" and had demonstrated an "unwillingness to control or correct" it. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dusen, 38, is serving his sentence at the California Men's Colony at San 
Luis Obispo, Cordileone said. He is eligible for parole in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Benson's children filed their lawsuit last April. Lawyers for Van Dusen and the 
insurance company did not return phone calls Friday to their offices.

CHATSWORTH LAWYER FACES MORE CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Chatsworth lawyer accused by the State Bar of California of embezzling at 
least $125,000 from dozens of clients is facing additional charges of forgery, 
grand theft and practicing law while under suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Richard F. Murkey, 43, was arrested Thursday by Los Angeles police officers at 
the Van Nuys Superior Court after an appearance on the three counts of grand 
theft and two counts of forgery with which he had been charged earlier, 
Detective Richard Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Murkey had pleaded not guilty to those charges and was free on $150,000 bail 
when arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office plans to charge Murkey with an additional three 
counts of practicing law while suspended, four counts of grand theft and one 
count of forgery, Deputy Dist. Atty. James A. Baker said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the new charges would add two years to the six years in prison 
Murkey already faces, Baker said. He said the additional grand theft charges 
arose when victims came forward in response to publicity from Murkey's earlier 
arrest, and also from investigations by police and the State Bar of California. 
</P>
<P>
Among the new forgery charges is an allegation that Murkey signed the name of a 
client's wife on a $25,000 insurance settlement check last year. 
</P>
<P>
Murkey also is accused of practicing law and negotiating with clients after 
August, when the State Bar of California temporarily suspended his license. The 
State Bar is seeking to disbar Murkey permanently. 
</P>
<P>
A personal injury lawyer handling mostly automobile accident cases, Murkey 
allegedly swindled more than 29 clients and their doctors out of $125,000 in 
insurance settlement payments. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Murkey settled cases without approval or knowledge of 
his clients, then forged their signatures on checks to get the funds. In one 
instance, Murkey allegedly pressed an accident victim to sign a retainer 
agreement while the victim lay in a hospital bed with a brain concussion. 
</P>
<P>
Bank records indicate that Murkey, who filed for bankruptcy in September, used 
the money for real estate investments, Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
He was being held Friday in Van Nuys Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Murkey's attorney, Sherwin C. Edelberg, could not be reached for comment.

AROUND THE VALLEY: PAST PRESENTS OF CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sebastian Rotella 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a gray December afternoon, a search for Christmas leads to Villa Scalabrini 
in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Scalabrini is a retirement home and cultural center of the 
Italian-American community. Its 108 residents are predominantly 
Italian-American. The priests who run the retirement center are members of an 
order founded by Bishop John Baptist Scalabrini with the mission of ministering 
to Italian immigrants around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The retirement center's lunchtime Christmas celebration is going full swing. 
Small glasses of red wine accompany meals in the spacious dining room. Santa 
Claus makes a triumphant appearance in a rolling cart -- "direct from the Pole 
North," someone says. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Claus' accent resembles that of Father Mario Trecco, director of Villa 
Scalabrini and editor of "L'Italo-Americano" a weekly bilingual newspaper for 
California Italian-Americans. Residents greet him with measured glee and 
dignity as he dispenses gift bags prepared by nuns in white. 
</P>
<P>
As Bishop Scalabrini knew, in a city and nation where so many people come from 
somewhere else, Christmas can be rough. The holiday takes on a sense of loss. 
The immigrant must reconstruct that which is absent: country, city, 
neighborhood, family. 
</P>
<P>
But the people at Villa Scalabrini are veterans of countless immigrant 
Christmases. They are frail warriors wearing the strong armor of memories and 
myths that preserve culture. 
</P>
<P>
As the diners sing "Silent Night," Maria Foggetta, 87, remembers the figurines 
of the family Nativity scene handmade by shepherds in the southern Italian 
province of Bari. She remembers the shepherds playing music on wooden flutes. 
And she cannot forget Jan. 6, 1921, the Epiphany Day when she and her family 
departed to join her father in America, where they would spend a month in 
barracks on Ellis Island. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother cried and prayed," she says, her Italian retaining the broad Barese 
accent. "They wouldn't let our father in to see us. Finally he came on a boat 
and threw a package of food to some sailors on the island, who brought it to 
us. And finally my mother ate something." 
</P>
<P>
Foggetta and others review a melancholy catalogue of Little Italys decimated by 
urban strife and ethnic migration, skeleton communities reduced to a church, a 
social club, huddled shops and restaurants. Places such as North Broadway in 
Los Angeles, Taylor Street in Chicago, Brooklyn's Lafayette Avenue, where the 
Foggettas settled. 
</P>
<P>
She says her father rode a horse-drawn cart to Mulberry Street in Manhattan to 
buy Christmas provisions, sustaining traditions that Foggetta and her husband 
would later bring with them to Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
"We were married 63 years," she says. "You hear people say they were married 23 
years, big deal, 43 years, big deal. Sixty-three years! The first man kissed 
and the last." 
</P>
<P>
After lunch, Fillippo Molinari, 97, holds court in the lounge next to the 
dining room. The topic is Christmas, 1916, in the mountain trenches near the 
Austrian border during World War I. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the most terrible front of the war," he says in Italian. "All rocks . . 
. The Austrians were 15 meters away." 
</P>
<P>
Molinari has dressed up for the celebration in jacket, slacks, tie and 
comfortable gym shoes, his cane propped against the easy chair. Molinari's 
hearing isn't what it used to be, and he sits serenely as Father Trecco and a 
visitor take turns bellowing questions at him. Three ladies watch from a couch, 
making occasional comments. 
</P>
<P>
Molinari recites details methodically, like a man touching every plank of a 
fragile footbridge: the "famous" Christmas ravioli of his native region of 
Liguria; the grocery he owned in 1911 as an immigrant in Valparaiso, Chile; the 
cold in a Montana concentration camp for Italians, Germans and Japanese where 
he spent two Christmases during World War II because of his fascist sympathies, 
though he insists he had only respect for America. 
</P>
<P>
He even remembers the numbers of his battalion and regiment during the First 
World War. On the 50th anniversary of his service against the Austrians, he was 
awarded the title of "Cavaliere" from the Italian government. 
</P>
<P>
Molinari recalls an episode of goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
"I jumped into a trench and there was an Austrian soldier. He threw down his 
rifle. He says, "I'm Italian, I'm from Trieste,' " -- a city with a large 
Italian population controlled by Austria at the time. 
</P>
<P>
The soldier gave Molinari a piece of bread. Molinari gave the "Triestino" a 
lemon, and let him seek refuge on the Italian side of the lines. 
</P>
<P>
"We hugged each other, and I said, 'For you the war is over.' "

LATIN AMERICA: UNILATERAL MILITARY ACTION IS HORRIFYING TO NATIONS THAT HAVE

It was not unexpected that the Organization of American States would call for 
the withdrawal of American forces from Panama, declaring, as it did Friday, 
that its members "deeply regretted" the U.S. military action. As could be 
expected, only the United States voted against the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
One may also expect that very limited attention will be paid by President Bush 
to the O.A.S. request. After all, in the course of Thursday's press conference, 
Bush expressed his gratitude for Latin America's support, just hours after 
clear and open disapproval had been expressed by the leaders of such normally 
friendly governments as Brazil and Mexico, and Peru had recalled its 
ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
Many in Washington seem to hold the view that unilateral U.S. action was made 
almost inevitable by the inability of those same Latin American countries to 
"solve the Panamanian problem" through multilateral channels. This will not 
make it any easier for Latin American opinion to cut through the wave of 
domestic support that follows immediately after a "decisive action" is 
undertaken by the U.S. (or almost any other nation's) government. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the lack of historical awareness and sensitivity that Latin 
Americans have come to identify with their northern neighbor seems compounded 
by an apparent tendency in Washington to deal with the implications of present 
U.S actions as if they were limited to an isolated issue -- one in which the 
whole hemisphere has found good reason for agreement. The invasion's impact on 
inter-American relations will certainly endure beyond this specific action. 
</P>
<P>
During the last decade, U.S. ability to both dominate and lead the hemisphere 
has been caught in a paradox. On the one hand, events in Central America, 
particularly in El Salvador and Nicaragua, provided ample proof of the United 
States' limitations, even in cases that it defined as priorities. But it is 
also hard to remember another moment in which as many Latin American 
governments and political forces shared U.S. preferences regarding such crucial 
topics as basic economic policies or a common commitment to liberal democracy. 
</P>
<P>
The way in which Latin American nations dealt with the "Panama problem" shows 
both the potential and the limits of that increased agreement, in crucial 
matters of regional security. 
</P>
<P>
Two different principles have been at play: the aforementioned commitment to 
democracy and the region's defense of non-intervention. So Gen. Manuel Noriega 
had few defenders, but many Latin Americans were not happy with simply 
following the the U.S. lead in identifying the one non-democratic government 
that was to be subject to open pressure. There have been authoritarians 
aplenty, both past and present, toward whom the United States has proven 
remarkably tolerant. There was also a general unease with a perceived U.S. 
tendency to "put to the democratic test" only those governments with which it 
has other reasons to disagree. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Noriega, many observers wondered how the same corrupt 
authoritarian who had once been a close friend and ally could suddenly become 
so unpalatable. Some even came to the conclusion that promoting democracy in 
Panama was really second in Washington's strategic calculations to the need to 
have a "predictable" and "understanding" government in place before time runs 
out on the Panama Canal's transfer to Panamanian authority. 
</P>
<P>
Several Latin American governments have been, up to this very week, willing to 
go along with basic U.S. preferences. But even before the invasion, public 
disclosures of U.S. actions in Panama increasingly tested such willingness and 
provoked muted disagreement. First came the acknowledgement of the sizable (in 
relation to Panama's size) amount of dollars spent by the U.S. government in 
order to influence the last electoral campaign. Then, the knowledge of covert 
operations directed at destabilizing Panama's government. Now it is direct 
unilateral military action. Even Venezuela's flexible interpretations of the 
principle of non-intervention in relation to democracy do not go that far. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard for U.S. observers to appreciate the hold that non-intervention has 
on most Latin American minds. After all, U.S. tradition does not either oppose 
or favor intervention in principle. A "just cause" (as defined by North 
American perceptions) and above all, success in an endeavor, seem to make all 
the difference between "good" and "bad" interventions. 
</P>
<P>
Things look quite different from the perspective of those countries that have 
suffered foreign military interventions, which most of the time have come not 
from extra-hemispheric powers but from our hemisphere's leading country. Any 
such U.S. action is necessarily seen as part of a well-known and recurring 
pattern -- one that many in the region had hoped to see disappear as a result 
of global changes. 
</P>
<P>
By invading Panama, the U.S. government has provided common ground for diverse 
governments and political forces in the region that are unwilling to condone 
unilateral military action by a superpower -- even against a government that 
most of them do not hold dear. Not since the Malvinas/Falklands conflict 
between Britain and Argentina have the basic assumptions of the inter-American 
system been put to such a test. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. actions violate the letter and the spirit of the key documents that are 
supposed to guide relations in the hemisphere. Even the usual appeals to 
"collective self-defense" are absent. In contrast to the case of Grenada, we 
are not even offered the fig leaf of a request by Panama's neighbors. Not even 
a post-facto, pro-forma attempt to attain multilateral acquiescence has been 
made -- as was the case in the Dominican Republic in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Panama, the entirely unilateral nature of U.S. action stands 
there naked, for all to see. The ultimate paradox of this action may be to 
transform Noriega -- a character that very few in Latin America are willing to 
touch without a long pole -- into a credible symbol not only of Panamanian but 
even of Latin nationalism.

SELLING PIECES OF BERLIN WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There must be something peculiar to our species that we have this preoccupation 
with rocks. When we're growing up, we collect them. When we stop growing, we 
erect them -- into walls. 
</P>
<P>
I've touched rocks and walls in Washington, D.C. One rock was polished smooth 
so that people couldn't break off a piece. It was from the moon. One wall was 
nothing but broken pieces -- its black surface scratched with the names of a 
few of my teen-age friends -- and 58,000 more. 
</P>
<P>
The Berlin Wall, now there was a wall! It divided people and ideologies for 
more than a quarter century. They got their money's worth when they built that 
eyesore. 
</P>
<P>
I never actually thought we'd ever see an end to the Berlin Wall, except from 
Soviet Bloc tanks blasting through. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, I bought a piece of that monument to subjugation, at a department 
store, at $10 a pop, just in time for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
I know it's an artifact, and a piece of history, but every time I look at it I 
have to smile. There's just something about the thought of free enterprise 
selling the Wall for profit that smacks of poetic justice. 
</P>
<P>
Who says God doesn't have a sense of humor? Only those who don't know him and 
build walls.

CRANSTON AND LINCOLN S&amp;L SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How refreshing to learn of Lampel's means of gaining Cranston's attention when 
no other conventional method prevailed. Surely the honorable senator, having 
been backed into a corner by Lampel, could do better than to offer assistance 
of a further bailout possibility by the federal government from a problem which 
he and the other four senators appeared to have aided and abetted. 
</P>
<P>
Damage control is a wonderful thing . . . when it works, but in this case, the 
voters will be the ones who will eventually decide at the polls in 1992. Their 
memories are, generally, not that short. If Cranston really wants to "aid" 
those poor bondholders, he could do a lot more positive things than offer lip 
service after the fact, and provide an aide's telephone number, after ignoring 
Ms. Lampel for so long. Is this the timely way he "responds to the needs of his 
constituents," the 23,000 bondholders, the way he did with Charlie Keating?

MASS SET FOR MICHAEL LEWIS, KOLL CO. EXECUTIVE

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A memorial Mass will be held at 11 a.m. Thursday at Our Lady Queen of Angels 
Catholic Church in Newport Beach for Michael L. Lewis, a Koll Co. executive who 
died Tuesday at his Laguna Beach home after an illness. He was 39. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was a senior vice president of development for the Newport Beach division 
of the Koll Co. responsible for operations in Orange, Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties. He was also director of development for Koll Center 
Irvine, a 95-acre, $1-billion commercial center that includes a major public 
art program. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was a director of the Irvine Theatre Operating Co. and a member of Art 
Spaces Irvine, a group of businessmen who support arts projects in the city. 
Through Lewis, the Koll Co. donated the first piece of public art on city-owned 
land in Irvine, a Mark Lear sculpture that stands outside the Heritage Park 
Regional Library. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a marvelously compassionate man and very much a friend of the city of 
Irvine," Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was a native of Whittier. He graduated from La Serna High School and USC. 
Before joining the Koll Co., Lewis worked in the real estate division of the 
Newport Beach office of Prudential Insurance Co. of America. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his parents, John F. and Nancy Lewis of Del Mar, and four 
brothers: Tom, of Altadena; John, of Phoenix; Stuart, of Westport, Conn. and 
Bill, of San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services are private. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that 
donations be made to the Irvine Theatre or the AIDS Services Foundation of 
Orange County.

CRANSTON AND LINCOLN S&amp;L SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hooray for Shirley Lampel! It took guts to disrupt one of Sen. Alan Cranston's 
political forums on behalf of 23,000 holders of worthless junk bonds sold by 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan ("Cranston's Promise on Bonds Told," Dec. 17). But 
some folks will believe anyone and anything. After trusting Lincoln and losing 
her savings, how can Lampel be "absolutely positive" Cranston will keep his 
pledge to help the bondholders after his unabashed acceptance of some $900,000 
in political contributions through Lincoln's President Charles Keating? 
</P>
<P>
It's naive to presume a cunning, unconscionable and obsessed political animal 
like Cranston is interested in helping anyone but himself. After some two 
decades dedicated primarily to the job of raising funds and getting reelected, 
does Lampel truly believe Cranston is really interested in helping anyone but 
himself while he lies atop the political trash heap? Is she blind to the fact 
that Cranston spent the past couple of years fiddling with Keating's political 
contributions while the bondholders burned?

CHRISTMAS PAST AND PRESENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who can explain it? Each year the wonderful miracle of Christmas is repeated. 
It's as if our good God, during this period of time leading up to the birthday 
of his son, deluges the earth with his very own spirit of "giving," causing our 
selfish human natures to make a 180-degree turn and ask not what I can get but 
rather what I can "give" to others.

REGULATING VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article by William Trombley, reporting on the recently signed vocational 
school regulatory legislation ("Trade Schools Threaten Suit on State Rules," 
Part A, Dec. 13), brings to the public forum a much needed focus on the rights 
and responsibilities of both proprietary schools and students seeking 
educations from those schools. While it is inappropriate for the federal 
government, i.e., the Department of Education, to comment on the merits of the 
debate in progress between proponents and opponents of the law in question, it 
is important for the American taxpayer to understand that the California debate 
will have a very real impact nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
At issue here is the concept of consumer rights and institutional 
responsibility. From the perspective of the federal government, the taxpayer, 
who will in the coming year contribute nearly $10 billion toward federally 
assisted student loans and grants, must believe that those hard-earned dollars 
will not be squandered or wasted. 
</P>
<P>
The students who apply for and receive those dollars must be assured a fair and 
equitable return on their tuition; they must believe that they will receive the 
best education possible resulting in access to better earnings and quality of 
life in general. The students have a right -- as do American taxpayers -- to 
expect quality from their chosen institutions of higher education. 
</P>
<P>
In return for the fees they collect, those institutions must exercise a great 
degree of responsibility. The promise of a quality education should not begin 
in the cashier's office, and it must certainly not stop there. There is no 
place in this nation's education continuum for sellers of hollow promises and 
baseless dreams. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Education is faced with a staggering $8 billion in 
student loan defaults. While there are virtually as many stories behind each 
default as there are students in default, there is one story that troubles us 
all and that is the one of deceit and misrepresentation, of institutional 
financial and management failure, of unrealized opportunities and broken 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
How many students complete a course, what percentage of students are placed in 
course-related employment, and institutional effectiveness are valid issues for 
discussion simply because they are very visible indicators of an institution's 
ability to carry out its advertised mission. The debate that surrounded the 
California legislation is being carried on in the much larger national forum as 
the U.S. Department of Education begins to frame language for the 
reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965, due for congressional 
action in 1991. The same issues of accountability, responsibility and rights 
come up time and time again in our public meetings all around the country. 
</P>
<P>
And while reauthorization is not restricted to proprietary, for-profit 
vocational schools, we do intend to promote stringent regulations, within the 
federal government's role, to protect consumers of education -- students -- who 
may be more at risk, and, therefore, more susceptible to institutional abuses, 
in the burgeoning vocational-school marketplace. Education is America's 
investment in itself, and that investment must be protected against 
institutional abuse and/or mismanagement, whether intentional or not. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Education is already prepared to deal with proprietary 
schools that fail to deliver on their promises and the reasonable expectations 
of their students. As stewards of the public's education dollars, we owe it to 
this nation's citizens to require fair and equitable access to quality 
education for all. The decade ahead will be a decade of opportunity and a 
decade of action for education programs all across America. The U.S. Department 
of Education, in partnership with the governors, legislatures, and departments 
of education in all 50 states will exercise its responsibility to vouchsafe the 
rights of our students, and we encourage our partners to do no less.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
A QUESTION OF PRIORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, has called 
for a staff study to help determine just how active county government should be 
in the arts. The study is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
The questions of whether the county should have an arts policy and, if so, what 
it should be, are interesting ones that should be determined. 
</P>
<P>
Several cities in the county have long provided support for the arts. Just last 
Thursday Dana Point, one of the county's newest cities, allocated a modest 
$27,500 to six local cultural organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Although the county for years has been conspicuous by its absence in support of 
the arts, its consideration of financial support now is curious, coming when 
the county budget is strained and when critical community needs -- like 
prenatal and maternity care for impoverished pregnant women and support for 
trauma centers -- are woefully underfunded. 
</P>
<P>
Although the spending of public funds to support cultural facilities and 
programs has long historic precedence, even in the best of financial times, 
government spending is subject to hard priority decisions. That is even more 
true today. 
</P>
<P>
The county, however, still could play a vital role in the arts, financially as 
well as in other ways. It may be possible for the county to secure otherwise 
unobtainable funds that would not take money from other county programs. And 
there certainly is a need for leadership and coordination of countywide efforts 
in the arts that could bring together public and private efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Theater productions, concerts and museums are important to the quality of life. 
Riley is right in finally trying to determine the board's responsibilities in 
the county's cultural future.

ATTORNEY SAYS HE WILL OPPOSE GALLEGLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Freiman, a Camarillo tax attorney making his first run for public 
office, has announced he will seek the Democratic nomination next year against 
U.S. Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley). 
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old Freiman said he plans to criticize Gallegly for his opposition 
to abortion and for his stand on wages and working conditions. Gallegly has 
served two terms as U.S. representative for the conservative 21st District, 
which covers northwestern Los Angeles and southeastern Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman, an Agoura resident, acknowledged that he faces an uphill struggle to 
unseat Gallegly in the district, where registered Republicans outnumber 
Democrats about 3 to 2. Gallegly beat his Democratic challenger, Thousand Oaks 
attorney Don Stevens, 70% to 26% in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see anyone else running," Freiman said. "From what I hear, Democrats 
view this district as impregnable, but I feel someone should run" against 
Gallegly. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman said he did not have plans to raise campaign funds, but that he would 
be making as many public appearances as possible. 
</P>
<P>
He said abortion rights will be his main campaign theme and he criticized 
Gallegly for taking "no-choice" positions on abortion. He said Gallegly has 
voted against federally funded abortions for rape and incest victims and has 
favored a constitutional amendment banning abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel there will be a lot of crossover votes by Republicans," he said. "There 
are a lot of yuppies here and they feel strongly about pro-choice." 
</P>
<P>
Freiman also complained that Gallegly has voted repeatedly against hikes in the 
federal minimum wage while voting to increase congressional salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Freiman described himself as a moderate on social issues and a conservative on 
defense and foreign policy matters. Despite recent events in Eastern Europe, he 
said he opposes "wholesale cuts" in defense spending, saying the United States 
should always negotiate from a position of strength.

Although I concur with Bob Oates' pro football column ("When They're Telling Us

He should ask the same question of The Times sportswriters.

TELEVISION COULD HAVE CLEARED THE GRAY AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The officials did not have the advantage that Chick Hearn, Stu Lantz and the 
television audience had: We saw the Laker brawl from three different angles, 
replayed about a half-dozen times. The officials' call of the fight was totally 
out of line. Stuart Gray went on a one-man rampage and should have been the 
only player ejected. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, the officials would have made a much better call if they had 
viewed the television coverage. Granted, basketball is probably much too 
fast-moving for TV replays to settle most questionable calls; but in a drastic 
case, such as Gray's outburst, the officials need the eyes of TV cameras.

HERE'S A FUND WAY TO SUPPLEMENT NFL DRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the issue of NFL teams drafting underclassmen and the potential 
damage to marginal players, how is this for a solution: 
</P>
<P>
Any NFL team signing a player with eligibility remaining should be required to 
fund a $100,000 trust fund for the player. Such fund could be used only for the 
athlete's continuing college education. 
</P>
<P>
The effect is to protect the athlete's opportunity to get a college education 
and also to raise the stakes for teams that draft underclassmen.

The snipers will probably be all over Jim Murray regarding his comments on the 
fake field goal call by John Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
Those will be the people who read Mike Downey. Jim Murray is right, as usual. 
This would have been a great call in the first game of the season, but in a 
game like that, you go for the points.

UNSPORTSMANLIKE WRITING GETS LITERARY CRITIQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the life of me, I cannot understand why Jim Murray would compare the 
Houston Oilers to the defendants at Nuremberg. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, referring to Cincinnati's drubbing of the Oilers, states, "We haven't 
seen this kind of runaway kicking of a man when he was down since Nuremberg." 
</P>
<P>
Now, I can sympathize with a proud group of athletes that is humiliated. But 
the defendants at Nuremberg? 
</P>
<P>
Many people fear that the horror of the Holocaust will begin to fade in time. 
It is grossly insensitive statements like Murray's that hurry the process 
along.

CAPISTRANO VALLEY GETS HEALTHY IN VICTORY OVER CORONA DEL MAR

<TEXT>
<P>
Corona del Mar High School's basketball team displayed an impressive amount of 
tenacity Friday night in its nonleague game against Capistrano Valley, the 
county's second-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
Was it good enough for an upset? Not quite. Not with Capistrano Valley forward 
Scott McCorkle back in the lineup after missing one game because of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
McCorkle scored a game-high 38 points -- including 16 in the first half -- to 
lead Capistrano Valley to a 66-53 victory at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
For Capistrano Valley (8-2), the victory should help to boost the team's 
confidence for its next venture: the King Cotton tournament, one of the most 
prestigious in the nation, Dec. 26-30 at Pine Bluff, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
Especially uplifting for the Cougars was the play of McCorkle, a 6-foot-5, 
210-pound senior forward headed for Syracuse next year. McCorkle did not play 
in Capistrano Valley's 82-59 loss to Edison Wednesday night. But against Corona 
del Mar, McCorkle was tough to stop, especially in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar (4-5) struggled early, forcing shots and making mental mistakes 
as Capistrano Valley took a 10-3 lead. After a timeout, Corona del Mar upped 
its man-to-man defensive pressure, and slowly chipped away at Capistrano 
Valley's lead. 
</P>
<P>
After trailing 31-24 at halftime, Corona del Mar held Capistrano Valley 
scoreless for the first four minutes of the third quarter, as it went on an 8-0 
run to take a 32-31 advantage. The score was tied at the start of the fourth 
quarter, 39-39. 
</P>
<P>
That would be as close as Corona del Mar would get. As the Sea Kings' game fell 
apart -- thanks, in part, to a pressing Capistrano Valley defense -- Capistrano 
Valley went on an 11-2 run, thanks to a three-pointer and a layup off a steal 
by Chris Kostoff and six points, four on free throws, by McCorkle. 
</P>
<P>
Kostoff, who scored 40 points Wednesday night, was held to 11 points, nine in 
the fourth period. Warren Johnson had 24 points to lead the Sea Kings, and Doug 
Hesse added 16.

the Cypress tournament championship game, emerging with a 44-38 victory. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been easier if the Seahawks (10-0) had come up with their 
strategy earlier: feed Jenny Sullivan the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, Ocean View's 6-foot-2 center, scored a career-high 33 points, 
including all of the Seahawks' 13 points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Jenny is always a dominant defensive player," Ocean View Coach Ollie Martin 
said. "Now she knows how to dominate both (offense and defense)." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View took a 13-8 lead in the first quarter, but Gahr roared back in the 
second, took advantage of the Seahawks' nine turnovers and entered halftime 
with a two-point lead, 21-19. 
</P>
<P>
Martin told his team to change its offense in the third quarter, and it fed the 
ball to Sullivan, who scored 10 points as the teams tied three times, at 23-23, 
25-25 and 27-27. 
</P>
<P>
"The fatigue factor is what gets us in these tournaments," Martin said. "We 
came off the full-court press in the second half because of it." 
</P>
<P>
With Sullivan consistently managing to get open under the basket, Ocean View 
held a 44-32 lead at one point in the fourth quarter, but Gahr scored six 
unanswered points in the game's final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
In other Cypress tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Cypress 58, Marina 54 -- Although Christa Yorke scored a game-high 21 points 
for Marina, Cypress came away with the third-place game. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 48, Foothill 33 -- Jennifer Rohrig scored 18 points to lead 
Mission Viejo (8-3) in the fifth-place game. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia 47, Kennedy 44 -- Sig Lo made two free throws with 30 seconds left to 
clinch the victory for Valencia (4-4) in the consolation championship.

LONG BEACH POLY HOLDS OFF EDISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a game in which momentum swung like a pendulum on a grandfather clock, Long 
Beach Poly High School held off Edison, 60-55, Friday night at the Edison gym. 
</P>
<P>
Poly (7-1) capitalized on six Edison turnovers in the final 6 minutes 21 
seconds and outscored the Chargers, 17-12, in the fourth quarter to break a 
43-43 tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Jackrabbits, who never trailed, sank 11 of 13 free throws and held Edison 
to five baskets in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way things go in a game of (scoring) runs like that," Edison Coach 
Jon Borchert said. "They were so much quicker than we were. When they pulled 
the ball out (to the perimeter) in the fourth quarter and started running time 
off the clock, I knew we were in trouble and had to foul." 
</P>
<P>
Edison (7-3) was in trouble in the first half too, trailing by as many as 15. 
</P>
<P>
Poly built a 35-22 halftime lead on the strength of an 8-1 scoring streak in 
the first quarter and 8-0 run in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We were intimidated early," Borchert said. "They are a very good club, but we 
made them look great in the first half. They're the best we've played." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Lovelady scored eight of his 13 points in the third quarter, including two 
three-pointers in a 13-0 run midway through the period, and the Chargers pulled 
even. 
</P>
<P>
Edison made eight of 11 shots in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We were standing around in the first half and were conceding things to them," 
Borchert said. "I wanted them to put forth the kind of effort they could be 
proud of in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Poly Coach Ron Palmer said his team fell apart defensively in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still wrestling with playing the type of ball we're capable of," Palmer 
said. "We're still looking to find our consistency." 
</P>
<P>
The Jackrabbits found some consistency at the free-throw line in the fourth 
quarter. Guard Tyus Edney, who finished with 12 points, made eight of nine free 
throws to help Poly pull away. 
</P>
<P>
And they found some consistency on defensive. The Jackrabbits held Edison to 
two points in first 6:52 of the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Willie McGinest, one of the most sought-after football players in the nation, 
scored 18 points, including five in the fourth quarter, to lead Poly.

</P>
<P>
SOCCER: ALL-AMERICAN MIDFIELDER HAS BROUGHT THE ABILITIES OF SIMI VALLEY 
PLAYERS TO ANOTHER LEVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After Craig Hampton was selected to the 1989 All-American soccer team earlier 
this month, some of his Simi Valley High teammates were awed by the senior 
midfielder's presence. 
</P>
<P>
But now the Pioneers have not only accepted Hampton's recognition by the 
National Soccer Coaches Assn. of America but some of his skills have begun to 
rub off on his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Some kids, when playing with a national-level player on their team, don't 
really shy away from him, they're a little intimidated," Simi Valley Coach Andy 
Silva said. "That intimidation carries right onto the field. We had a couple of 
players like that . . . it's sort of fading away now." 
</P>
<P>
Silva stressed that playing alongside Hampton has helped his teammates hone 
their own techniques. 
</P>
<P>
"Of (Hampton's) play and ability, it has brought the other kids' ability up to 
play top-level soccer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Top-level soccer has been a trademark of Simi Valley teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers have won seven Marmonte League championships this decade, 
including two three-year reigns from 1980-82 and 1984-86. They finished second 
in the Southern Section 4-A Division in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Simi Valley is ranked second behind defending 4-A champion Palos 
Verdes; Marmonte teams Royal and Newbury Park are ranked seventh and ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a good chance of going a long way in the 4-A," the 11th-year 
coach said, "but I don't want to count my chickens before they're hatched." 
</P>
<P>
Eight players return for Simi Valley -- including seven starters -- from last 
year's team that advanced to the 4-A quarterfinals before losing to Hawthorne, 
2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Hampton, senior midfielder Andre Markarian and junior striker Brian Weaver lead 
a potent Pioneer offense. 
</P>
<P>
In its first eight matches, Simi Valley is averaging 3.75 goals. 
</P>
<P>
Weaver has been equally effective at goal-scoring as well as feeding assists. 
Senior forward Kenny Greninger also is a frequent contributor. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley recorded five consecutive shutouts to start the season as 
goalkeepers Angelo Maccano and Mike Jones, a sophomore, shared time. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders Sean Kieldrup and Marc Cargnel head the Valley area's stingiest 
defense, which did not allow a goal in the Pioneers' first six games. 
</P>
<P>
Other teams to watch: 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands -- After a season in which the Raiders won only three matches, 
first-year Coach Al Tarazon has the Raiders playing well. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands is off to a 6-1-1 record and senior goalkeeper Rosario Pina has 
posted four shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Oscar Gutierrez and freshman Francisco Leon provide punch at forward 
for the a team dominated by underclassmen, and senior Victor Martinez and 
junior Jose Sarabia, both halfbacks, add depth. 
</P>
<P>
Senior twins Gabriel and German Prieto and juniors Lupe Moreno and Francisco 
Robles are key defenders. 
</P>
<P>
Royal -- After winning the 4-A title in the 1987-88 season and missing the 
playoffs the following year, the Highlanders again are on the upswing, starting 
the season 6-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
Senior striker Matt Brinkman, a dangerous offensive player, scored a hat trick 
Thursday in a 3-2 win over Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore goalkeeper Steven Hambly is the cornerstone of Royal's defense along 
with Michael Hansen and Daniel Anderson 
</P>
<P>
Marco Todesco is a quarterback-type player, setting up offensive plays from his 
midfielder position along with midfielder Kai Schraml. 
</P>
<P>
St. Francis -- First-year Coach Glen Appels inherited the defending Del Rey 
League titlist that went 16-1-1 last year and reached the semifinals of the 3-A 
playoffs before falling to eventual champion Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Nine players return, most of whom saw limited action. 
</P>
<P>
Senior David Beall scored six goals in this season's first five games from his 
midfielder position, and senior midfielder Erik Franken provides depth. 
</P>
<P>
Appels said that the Golden Knights' strength lies in their defense, for which 
he has two solid performers in defender Matthew Hydar and midfielder Mike 
Rendon, both seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs -- Although they had a less-than-stellar season in 1989, Mike 
Kodama's Indians have 11 players back. The addition of two forwards and a 
sweeper from last year's 16-1-2 junior varsity should spark Burroughs in the 
nine-team Foothill League. 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs compiled a 7-9-4 record and finished fifth in league play at 4-6-4. 
But with veteran players the Indians, behind their third-year coach, are 
already pushing good teams. They were edged recently by defending 1-A champion 
La Canada, 3-2, in a nonleague game. 
</P>
<P>
All-league defender Carlos Roque, a junior, is in the backfield along with 
sophomore sweeper Ian Goyanes, up from the junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors Sean O'Connor and Jeff Gierok, both third-year players, will lead the 
Indians' offense from their midfielder and forward positions. Senior forwards 
Octavio Alejandres and Jason Pitkin will provide additional support. 
</P>
<P>
L. A. Baptist -- Eleven players return for the Knights -- including eight 
starters -- from the team that lost in the quarterfinals of the 1989 Small 
Schools Division playoffs to eventual champion Morro Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Senior midfielder Ron Simpson, an All-Southern Section selection, scored 16 
goals and had 14 assists in leading L. A. Baptist to a 17-6-1 record.

The Bakersfield West High soccer team was not exactly in the Christmas spirit 
during a championship semifinal match against Simi Valley on Friday night, but 
that didn't stop the Blades from giving the Pioneers a couple of presents 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
And Simi Valley, in Scrooge-like fashion, did not respond in kind while taking 
a 3-2 victory at Simi Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
At the five-minute mark in the first half, Simi Valley forward Kenny Greninger 
booted a shot in front of the West goal that struck Viking defender Eric 
Fambrough in the chest before dropping across the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Four minutes later, West defender Tom Latham nailed a keeper pass back to 
goalkeeper Steve Vesper which rolled between Vesper's legs and into the net for 
a 2-0 Simi Valley lead. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer forward Spencer Belideau was credited with the second goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers (8-0) took a 3-0 advantage six minutes into the second half when 
midfielder Craig Hampton, on a corner kick from Brian Weaver, directed a head 
shot into the upper-middle portion of the net. 
</P>
<P>
West made it close on goals by Juan Cruz, on a head shot, and Francis Gangle. 
</P>
<P>
In another tournament match: 
</P>
<P>
Royal 2, Simi Valley JV 1 -- Striker Matt Brinkman scored on a bonus penalty 
kick at the 16-minute mark in the second half to put the Highlanders (6-0-1) 
into the tournament championship match against Marmonte League rival Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Brinkman's initial attempt was blocked but the senior was awarded another kick 
because Pioneer goalkeeper Mike Jones moved before Brinkman kicked the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley tied the score, 1-1, five minutes into the second half on a head 
shot from a yard out by freshman forward Kevin Mykolyk. 
</P>
<P>
Royal led, 1-0, at halftime after striker Mario Andrews scored on Daniel 
Morris' rebound shot at the 10-minute mark. MIKE GLAZE

<TEXT>
<P>
Oceanside Coach Steve Kinder made three observations before the Pirates played 
Mira Mesa for the Chula Vista Tournament boys' basketball title Friday night at 
Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Two were correct and negated the other as No. 10 Mira Mesa defeated Oceanside, 
95-82. 
</P>
<P>
Kinder's first two comments had to do with defending Mira Mesa. He said his 
team had to keep the ball away from Marc Ziegler and be wary of the Marauders' 
surprising quickness. The other concerned his team: "A score in the 75-85 range 
would be to our advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside was unable to keep the ball out of Ziegler's big hands, and Mira Mesa 
showed off its quickness by beating the Pirates at their own game. And that 
meant his point requirements weren't enough. 
</P>
<P>
Ziegler, a 6-foot-4 center, had 15 points and six rebounds in the first quarter 
to help Mira Mesa take a 28-11 lead. He added 10 more points, two rebounds and 
two blocks in the third quarter and finished with a game-high 31 points, plus 
14 rebounds and the tournament's most valuable player award. 
</P>
<P>
When Oceanside was successful stopping Ziegler, teammates J.J. Rowlett (18 
points), Kal Chatham (13) and Shed Smith (11) picked up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the play of Jerry Garrett (24 points, seven rebounds), Carl Mathis (16 
points) and Kenya Hunt (16 points), Oceanside tried to come back, but the 
Marauders would not relent. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always worried when we get out to a big lead like that in the first 
quarter," Mira Mesa Coach Tim Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside pulled to within seven, but Mira Mesa turned it on to lead, 48-34, at 
halftime. The Pirates got to within 83-74 with two minutes 24 seconds left, but 
Mira Mesa (8-4) made nine of 10 free throws down the stretch to secure its 
seventh victory in eight games. Oceanside, which had won four in a row, fell to 
6-3. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to run the fast break, and we knew that we could," Ziegler said. "We 
kept our heads that whole game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kinder: "We came out flat, and they were ready to play. I know I'm going 
to eat that quote now, but I still feel if we score in the 80s, we will usually 
win the game." JIM LINDGREN In other Chula Vista Tournament games: Chula Vista 
83, Crawford 57 -- Derek Chapman scored 19 points, and Carnell Penn had 14 to 
lead Chula Vista (7-3) to third. The Spartans led by just 19-16 after the first 
quarter but outscored Crawford, 62-40, the rest of the way. "Midway from the 
first quarter on we really played heads up," Chula Vista Coach Mike Collins 
said. "I was very pleased the way the bench came in and did the job." Senior 
guards Tracy Halton had 23, and Tito Singleton added 18 for Crawford. Hilltop 
68, Coronado 62 -- Carlos Gonzales scored 23 points, and Carlos Marques added 
12 for Hilltop, which finished fifth. El Cajon Valley 49, Santana 46 -- El 
Cajon survived a 16-9 fourth quarter and held on to claim seventh. Gil Velasco 
had 15 for the winners.

<P>
Wide receiver Anthony Miller has been chosen by his teammates as the Chargers' 
most valuable player this season. 
</P>
<P>
Other Charger awards were given to outside linebacker Ken Woodard (best special 
teams player), defensive ends Leslie O'Neal and Lee Williams (best linemen) and 
cornerback Gill Byrd (most inspirational). 
</P>
<P>
Miller, in his second year out of Tennessee, has caught 70 passes for 1,199 
yards and 10 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Woodard leads the special teams with 12 tackles. He deflected a punt to set up 
the winning touchdown Nov. 12 against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neal is second in total tackles with 88. Williams is fourth with 66 and was 
selected to the Pro Bowl this week for the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
Byrd has seven interceptions, tops for AFC cornerbacks. He has 25 career 
interceptions, which ties him for second on the team's all-time list with Kenny 
Graham. DON PATTERSON

PREVIOUS CIPHER TALKS FAILED, ARCHIVE REVEALS 
</P>

Archive Corp.'s $109-million hostile takeover bid for Cipher Data Products of 
San Diego follows two aborted merger attempts between the two rival computer 
products manufacturers in 1986 and 1988, the company disclosed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Costa 
Mesa-based Archive revealed that Cipher blames it for backing out of the 
earlier merger talks, and that Cipher's chairman has already told Archive that 
its current $7.50-a-share offer is inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Archive has acquired 4.6% of Cipher's stock and Tuesday said it was launching a 
tender offer to buy the rest of the company's outstanding shares. Cipher 
officials said its board is studying the offer, which expires Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Archive and Cipher are leading manufacturers of tape drives used to copy data 
stored on computer hard-disk drives. The two companies are bitter rivals, not 
only in the marketplace but in the courtroom, where they are locked in a patent 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC filing states that Archive Chairman Howard Lewis approached Cipher 
management about a possible merger for the first time in May, 1986. The talks 
broke down after four months, when the companies could not agree on a purchase 
price. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1988, Lewis and then-Cipher President Gary E. Liebl met to discuss a 
settlement of a patent suit between the two companies. During that meeting, 
Lewis proposed that Archive purchase Cipher's quarter-inch cartridge tape drive 
business and again raised the idea of a merger of the companies. The talks 
broke down the following month when, again, the firms couldn't agree on a 
price, the filing shows. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 13, Lewis approached Cipher for the third time to propose a merger. 
According to the filing, Cipher's Liebl told Lewis that "the two companies did 
not have a good track record of working together" and that "there had been 
promising discussions in the past, but Archive's board of directors had changed 
Archive's direction." 
</P>
<P>
At a face-to-face meeting Dec. 15, the SEC filing states, Liebl told Lewis that 
the $7.50-a-share proposal was too low and that he doubted Cipher's directors 
would support it. Liebl noted that Cipher's book value -- what the company 
would be worth if its assets were sold -- was more than $7.50 a share. Analysts 
have pegged Cipher's book value at $9 to $10 per share. 
</P>
<P>
According to the filing, Liebl also said he doubted that Archive was serious 
about its proposal because "it has backed away from two prior transactions with 
the company." 
</P>
<P>
But, on Dec. 19, Lewis sent a letter to Liebl informing him that Archive was 
launching a tender offer for Cipher and requesting a meeting to discuss the 
offer.

EDISON'S CHAIRMAN SAYS HE MAY RETIRE NEXT YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
UTILITIES: IF A PROPOSED $2.4-BILLION MERGER WITH SAN DIEGO GAS &amp; ELECTRIC 
IS STILL PENDING WHEN HOWARD ALLEN TURNS 65 IN OCTOBER, THE BOARD MAY WANT HIM 
TO STAY ON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard P. Allen, the outspoken and colorful chairman of Southern California 
Edison Co. and its holding company, said he might leave once he reaches the 
utility's retirement age of 65 next October, but he added that he will wait 
until August to decide. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Allen also confirmed that he met earlier this month with each 
member of the state Public Utilities Commission to say he was thinking of 
retiring -- even though the company's controversial $2.4-billion proposed 
merger with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. will probably remain unresolved at 
the time of his departure. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that I should call on each commissioner and tell them that I would be 
at normal retirement age in October and that I would be making a decision in 
August on this," Allen said in the interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the merger suggested that Allen might want to remove himself from 
public scrutiny since his gruff style has been something of a lightning rod for 
critics in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Other observers said they doubt that Edison's board will let Allen -- the 
architect of Edison's aggressive diversification -- go easily, since he is also 
the moving force behind the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he wants to retire, the 36-year Edison veteran sidestepped the 
question. "The board could conclude that it would be better if I stay on a year 
and wind this thing up in the interests of consumers and an orderly 
transition," he said. But he added, "I believe in normal retirement. A lot of 
mischief can be played by well-intentioned, good people who stay on too long." 
</P>
<P>
Likely candidates to succeed Allen include SCEcorp Executive Vice Presidents 
John E. Bryson and Michael R. Peevey. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to tell how things will sort out because (Allen) exerted such a 
strong hand in the company for a number of years," said Bud Moeller, a 
utilities analyst with Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, an energy-consulting firm in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Power, a former PUC administrative law judge and a lawyer specializing 
in utilities issues, said: "He's a hard act to follow. . . . But I don't see 
(Edison) losing direction. . . . If they stick to their business, they'll do 
just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Allen would leave behind an Edison career that climaxed with the company's 
aggressive moves into non-regulated businesses that helped it earn record 
profits in an increasingly competitive climate. 
</P>
<P>
Allen put together the plan to merge Edison with SDG&amp;E, a deal that would 
create the nation's largest supplier of electricity if it passes the lengthy 
federal and state regulatory process now under way. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed merger, though it has been approved by the San Diego utility's 
board, has drawn heated opposition from local San Diego groups contending that 
a merger would mean less control, higher rates, fewer jobs and more pollution 
in their city. Edison denies the charges. Some critics have argued that Allen 
himself has been insensitive to the concerns of San Diegans -- a charge that 
Allen disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Would Allen's retirement mollify the merger's opponents? 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are some people here who would be glad to see him go, but I 
don't think it would lessen the opposition," said Bob Hudson, executive 
director of the broad-based Coalition for Local Control, a San Diego group 
opposing the merger. "It's not a personality issue; it's about air pollution, 
rates and local control." 
</P>
<P>
Allen, a native of Upland and a former Stanford Law School professor, joined 
Edison in 1954 as a lobbyist in Sacramento. He has been president of the 
company since 1980 and chairman and chief executive since 1984. He holds the 
same three titles with the parent company, SCEcorp. 
</P>
<P>
Under Allen's stewardship, Edison has managed to steer away from investments in 
troubled nuclear projects or savings and loans that have proven disastrous for 
other utility companies. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with federal and state regulations that require Edison to buy power from 
independent producers at rates set by regulators, Allen oversaw the creation of 
a power producer, Mission Energy, a separate subsidiary of SCEcorp, to sell 
power to Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Allen has been a vocal opponent of such regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Energy now operates 18 energy projects, including cogeneration joint 
ventures with Texaco Inc. and Atlantic Richfield Co. SCEcorp also diversified 
into such non-regulated businesses as finance, real estate and engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Energy and the other non-regulated businesses now account for about 12% 
of SCEcorp's earnings, and Allen has said he foresees a time when the group's 
businesses might overshadow the utility.

PORTRAYAL OF FUR TRAPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent episode of "L.A. Law" featured Jimmy Smits' character representing a 
furrier who was suing an animal-activist group over the activists' militant 
vandalism against his business. The show was slanted. To give only two of many 
examples: 
</P>
<P>
A man whose livelihood depends on trapping held up an outdated trap, one that 
has been phased out in 99% of the country. 
</P>
<P>
The trapper claimed his traps were checked weekly. Local, state and federal law 
require checking traps daily, or a trapper could lose his license. 
</P>
<P>
How could a respected program such as "L.A. Law" present such a slant against 
an industry so rooted in our American heritage? When will urban Hollywood learn 
that we must utilize all of our natural resources instead of polluting our 
planet with synthetics? And that "humane" is a way to treat our fellow man. 
</P>
<P>
God-given animals are on our planet to be dealt with in respect and to utilize 
within nature.

PLAN TO CURTAIL IN-FLIGHT NEWSCASTS DEFENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Howard Rosenberg's Dec. 18 column, "CNN, American Airlines: All the News 
That Fits," in which he criticized a proposed agreement that major air 
disasters not be reported during in-flight newscasts purchased from Cable News 
Network: 
</P>
<P>
Rosenberg, along with almost every other journalist in America, is paranoid 
about censorship. If American Airlines does not want to buy a product, it does 
not have to. If I choose to not attend a showing of "Batman" I don't have to. 
Neither is censorship. 
</P>
<P>
Censorship is when the police power of the state is used to keep its citizens 
from hearing or reading certain things judged by the authorities to not be in 
the authorities' best interest. 
</P>
<P>
Censorship is when American Airlines stops Rosenberg from getting published, 
not when American Airlines picks and chooses what products to buy.

ART FROM EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re "ART/LA89 Draws Mixed Reviews From Local, Out-of-Town Dealers" by Suzanne 
Muchnic, Dec. 12: 
</P>
<P>
I was amused by the Europeans' dismay regarding local collectors' lack of 
sufficient interest in European art -- as if we should roll over and play dead 
for anything from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is that most of what came over from across the Atlantic was just not 
that good or new, in the opinion of many attending ART/LA89. Just because 
something is esoteric and ugly does not mean that it should automatically 
qualify as art. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be that local collectors don't care for the hodgepodge of detritus 
that European galleries try to push off on what they think is an uneducated 
local public? Convincing us of the merit of the work that they represent should 
be more than hanging it and then criticizing us for not salivating at its very 
sight.

CENTER SHOULD OFFER COFFEE TO CONCERT-GOERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My husband and I are longtime subscribers to the Orange County Philharmonic 
Society. We were disappointed when the philharmonic moved to the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center and began scheduling performances on weeknights. But we 
have since adjusted to that. 
</P>
<P>
However, there is one thing to which we have not adjusted: On concert nights we 
rush home from the office, have a quick supper and go off to the symphony. 
Frankly, we're tired and we often have to fight the urge to doze. We are not 
alone in this. Many of our friends have similar complaints. The philharmonic 
used to present its shows at the high school, and we could get a quick cup of 
coffee. But at the Center none is available. 
</P>
<P>
About two years ago I wrote to the president of the philharmonic to ask that 
they revive the custom of serving coffee. I was astounded to hear that the 
Center has no facilities to brew coffee. I have since heard that the problem is 
the carpeting -- that management is concerned about coffee stains. 
</P>
<P>
Why did they install carpeting that is susceptible to stains? Especially in a 
public place? Since they serve coffee at the Los Angeles Music Center, I can 
only assume that their carpeting is either stain-proof or they are more 
interested accommodating concert-goers than are their counterparts at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Once more, I write to ask that coffee be served before the performance and 
during intermission. But I propose a compromise: Engage an outside vendor to 
sell coffee out on the patio; the Center staff won't have to assume the added 
responsibility, and the carpeting will be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
One final thought: When you consider how society's attitude about drinking has 
changed, it would be to the Center's credit if they would offer a warm 
non-alcoholic drink as an alternative to wine.

DAY HIKE: NEW SUNNY TRAIL TO EXPLORE IN SOLSTICE CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY, McKinney is the author of hiking books and a regular 
contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Solstice Canyon Park in the Santa Monica Mountains is enjoyable year-round, but 
winter is a particularly fine time to ramble through the quiet canyon. A newly 
opened path -- Rising Sun Trail -- lets you explore the park's upper slopes, 
from which you might even sight gray whales migrating past Point Dume. 
</P>
<P>
Winter solstice, to us modern city dwellers, may seem nothing more than a 
scientific abstraction -- the time when the sun is farthest south of the 
Equator. However, to some of the earliest occupants of Southern California, the 
Chumash, the winter solstice was an important occasion. It was a time when the 
cosmic balance was very delicate. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of solstice observation caves and rock art sites have convinced 
anthropologists that the Chumash possessed a system of astronomy that had both 
mystical meaning and practical application. To those of us who buy all our food 
in the supermarket, winter solstice is just a date on the calendar, but to the 
Chumash -- who needed to know when berries would ripen, when the steelhead 
trout would run up Malibu Creek, when game would migrate -- the day was an 
important one. 
</P>
<P>
Solstice Canyon Park, carved out of land owned by the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, opened on summer solstice in 1988. The park is administered by the 
Mountains Conservancy Foundation, the operations arm of the Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
The park's most recent project is the just-completed Rising Sun Trail, which 
climbs the east wall of Solstice Canyon. Master trail builder Bruce Heckel and 
his crew reworked an old dirt road and blazed some new trail to complete the 
path. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to say that a trail on the east wall of a canyon called Solstice 
would be named Rising Sun Trail; however, the name did not arise out of 
anything so obvious. In fact, you'd need to be a darn good Southland historian 
to figure out how the trail got its name. 
</P>
<P>
The story began in 1851, when an Irishman named Mathew Keller arrived in Los 
Angeles and opened a general store on Los Angeles Street. Keller purchased 
property on Alameda Street where Union Station is now located. Soon he built a 
home, planted fruit trees and vineyards. In 1852 he established a winery, known 
as the Rising Sun Vineyard. At full capacity, the winery could turn out 200 
gallons of brandy and 1,000 gallons of wine daily. Keller's sherry was 
particularly good and won many awards at county fairs. 
</P>
<P>
Keller was very active in civic affairs and served terms on both the L.A. 
County Board of Supervisors and the Los Angeles City Council. He also pursued a 
broad range of entrepreneurial ventures: Keller was one of the original 
directors of the Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank and is often credited with being 
the first to raise cotton in California. 
</P>
<P>
Keller bought and sold many pieces of property in Southern California, among 
them the 13,OOO-acre Rancho Malibu. During the early 1880s, he planted 500 
acres of vines on this ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Today, looking at the ugly freight yards near Union Station, it's almost 
unimaginable to contemplate the beautiful vineyard planted by Keller along 
Alameda Boulevard. However, Keller's other property -- Rancho Malibu -- has 
retained much of its pastoral quality. Part of the old rancho is preserved as 
Solstice Canyon Park. 
</P>
<P>
The whole family will enjoy a walk through Solstice Canyon. Along the way, 
you'll pass the Keller House, built in 1865, and believed to be the oldest 
house in Malibu, perhaps in the Santa Monica Mountains. When restoration is 
complete, the house will become a museum and visitor center. 
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: From Pacific Coast Highway, about 17 miles up-coast 
from Santa Monica and 3 1/2 miles up-coast from Malibu Canyon Road, turn inland 
on Corral Canyon Road. At the first bend in the road, you'll leave the road and 
proceed straight to the very small Solstice Canyon parking lot. Beyond the 
parking lot, the park access road is usually closed; however, on some weekends, 
visitors are permitted to drive in and park in a second, larger lot, located 
just up the road. 
</P>
<P>
The Hike: Walk up the park road to a small house, which is headquarters for the 
Mountains Conservancy Foundation. Trail maps are available at a small dispenser 
in front of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Walk along the creek bed on the one-way road. You'll pass El Alisar Picnic Area 
and begin to angle north on the canyon road, Old Solstice Road. Before long, 
you'll spot the stone 1865 Keller House to the right of the road. A short 
distance farther along the bottom of Solstice Canyon is Fern Grotto Picnic 
Area. 
</P>
<P>
The road travels under the shade of oak and sycamore to its end at the remains 
of the old Roberts Ranch House, destroyed in a 1982 fire. Palms, agave, bamboo 
and bird of paradise and many more tropical plants thrive in the Roberts' 
garden gone wild. A waterfall, fountain and an old dam are some of the other 
special features found in this paradisiacal setting, now known as Tropical 
Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
Just below Tropical Terrace is the unsigned beginning of Rising Sun Trail. The 
trail crosses a seasonal creek, briefly follows a narrow ravine, then ascends 
moderately to steeply up the east wall of Solstice Canyon. You'll get 
over-the-shoulder views of the ruins of the Roberts House and great views of 
the Pacific Ocean dead ahead. 
</P>
<P>
After switchbacking east up the chaparral-covered canyon wall, Rising Sun Trail 
takes a more southerly course and passes near a prominent outcropping known as 
Lisa's Rock. 
</P>
<P>
The trail dips into and out of a ravine, then joins an old dirt road and begins 
descending. You'll soon spot a strange structure resembling a kind of 
futuristic farmhouse with a silo attached. From 1961 to 1973, Space Tech Labs, 
a subsidiary of TRW, used the building to conduct tests to determine the 
magnetic sensitivity of satellite instrumentation. Rising Sun Trail ends at the 
TRW Building, which is now headquarters for the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
From the small parking area, join the TRW Trail and switchback down to the park 
road and back to the trailhead.

YOUR STAMPS: GIFT IDEAS TO HELP OUT LAST-MINUTE SHOPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY KRAUSE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: With the holidays upon us, I still have a few more last-minute gifts 
to buy. What do you recommend as presents for stamp collectors? -- F.L. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Stamp tongs, hinges, small glassine envelopes, perforation gauges, 
Mylar cover protectors, stock books, reference books on philately, a new stamp 
album or, of course, one of the standard catalogues of stamp values. All of 
these are for sale in local stamp shops (addresses listed under "Stamps for 
Collectors" in the telephone Yellow Pages). 
</P>
<P>
Find out what the collectors on your gift list need in the line of accessories, 
or ask what they collect and get them a few stamps in their area of specialty. 
If you know who their favorite stamp dealers are, go there; you'll be doing 
business with dealers who are familiar with their customers' needs. 
</P>
<P>
Most post offices sell little books on stamp collecting, as well as kits and 
souvenir folders for beginners. Most general new-book stores carry the Official 
1990 Blackbook Price Guide of United States Postage Stamps, a $4.95 paperback 
that serves as an excellent pocket-size checklist of all major U.S. stamps 
listed by Scott numbers. 
</P>

And then there's the 1990 Scott Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps, 
which lists the retail values of all major U.S. stamp varieties and provides a 
wealth of information for people who buy, sell or study U.S. stamps; retail 
price is $25. The catalogue is for sale by nearly every stamp dealer and in 
most large bookstores. The Scott Specialized offers a philatelic education in 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Where can I get some computer software programs for inventorying my stamp 
collection? -- P.D. 
</P>
<P>
A: Try Compu-Quote, 6914 Berquist Ave., Canoga Park, Calif. 91307, telephone 
(818) 348-3662. They sell software for coins, stamps, and baseball cards. Ask 
for their catalogue of "Software for Collectors." 
</P>
<P>
Q: A dealer offered me a set of two stamps he called the Ronald Reagan 
signature stamps; he said they were issued by the White House about 20 months 
ago at $75. He says they are now selling for $400 and implied that since they 
were rare and investment grade, they could increase 40% in value each year. I 
checked several catalogues but can't find these items listed. I think they are 
privately printed labels, like Christmas seals and have, therefore, no 
philatelic value. -- M.R. 
</P>
<P>
A: If it is such a good deal, why doesn't the dealer save them and earn a cool 
40% per year? I haven't seen these stamps, but I can think of a lot of other 
issues I would rather buy.

BEST BABY PICTURES ARE A SNAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDY COLTON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems that hardly a day goes by that I'm not looking at some baby pictures, 
usually displayed by a proud parent or grandparent. It's an international 
custom and there's nothing wrong with it. 
</P>
<P>
I have a few tips for taking better baby pictures, but first, a warning: 
Photographs of babies are best when shot from close-up. But avoid using flash. 
A flash can harm a baby's eyes. Have you ever had a flash go off a few feet in 
front of you while you are staring directly at it? How long was it before you 
could see again? 
</P>
<P>
Rather than use flash, use the light from a window. Soft Northern light is 
better than sunlight. Do not shoot toward the window but parallel to it or away 
from it. 
</P>
<P>
Babies are not self-conscious in front of a camera as are many older children 
and adults. Just give them a prop like a ball or a towel and snap away. 
</P>
<P>
A baby peeking out from under a towel or blanket is very appealing. The baby is 
usually happy because the blanket is warm, cozy and associated with the 
peekaboo game that all babies love. As anyone taking baby pictures soon learns, 
a happy baby makes for good pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Opportunities for pictures occur throughout the baby's day. However, one of the 
best times to take pictures is just after a nap, when the baby is rested and 
alert. 
</P>
<P>
For an excellent series of pictures, photograph the baby while he or she is 
being fed or being given a bath. A particularly interesting series can show the 
baby when he or she is first beginning to learn to eat without help. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you pose your pictures or take them just as they happen, remember to 
aim from the baby's level, even though it may mean getting down on the floor 
yourself.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: DISCUSS CHILD'S NIGHTTIME FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My 7-year-old son is suddenly afraid of the dark and begs 
not to have to sleep alone if the light is turned off. I don't want him to get 
in the habit of sleeping in my bed, so I bought an attractive little night 
light and I allow him to keep it on. His grandfather feels this is spoiling him 
and is convinced he'll grow up to be a sissy because of my "coddling." -- B.P. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR B.P.: Grandfather is badly misinformed, and your instinct is correct. Talk 
with your son about his fears of the dark, let him know that you always want 
him to discuss anything that's troubling or frightening him and that he's free 
to turn the light off or on whenever he wishes. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes youngsters associate darkness with being left alone or being lost. 
Some youngsters associate darkness with death, and if this is the case, it is 
something you need to explore and talk about. As Dr. Jonathan Kellerman points 
out in his book "Helping the Fearful Child," for 6-, 7- and 8-year-olds, death 
is often seen as someone or something who comes in the night. 
</P>
<P>
Parents who refer to death as sleep or a journey often have children who 
develop anxiety about the dark. Maybe you should ask your son if he knows why 
he suddenly developed this fear of darkness. You may be able to help him 
overcome his fear by gradually rewarding him for success when, over a period of 
weeks, he's able to reduce the wattage of the light. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My neighbor, a woman in her mid-50s, is very strange. 
Sometimes, she's the nicest person and one couldn't wish for a better, more 
considerate neighbor, but at other times, she's horrible and almost frightening 
to me. Her husband told me that she's being treated for what he calls MPD. He 
says she has more than one personality. How could this be? -- V.T. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR V.T.: Drugs and alcohol have nothing to do with this disorder, although if 
there are multiple personalities, one of these personalities may drink or abuse 
drugs. MPD, or multiple personality disorder, was considered a separate and 
highly treatable mental condition by the American Psychiatric Assn. in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
It's relatively rare, but there's little question that some individuals do have 
more than one personality -- even two personalities are enough to meet the 
definition of MPD. 
</P>
<P>
It's believed that these personality splits begin in childhood when some 
traumatic incident sets it off. Occasionally, as a reaction to serious child 
abuse, the mind fragments or splits off in order to cope with the pain and a 
separate personality emerges to deal with the next psychic assaults.

U.S. RUSHES IN AID TO PANAMA GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Shaken by the lawlessness and chaos still plaguing Panama more than two days 
after Wednesday's U.S. invasion, Bush Administration officials have mounted a 
hurried but massive effort to help organize and put in place a government for 
that nation's new president, Guillermo Endara. 
</P>
<P>
Although concerned that too much U.S. involvement will cause Endara to be 
viewed as a puppet, Administration officials dispatched political advisers as 
well as communications equipment, transportation and other material aid to help 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"The State Department has sent down some civic-affairs types to give political 
advice," a senior aide to President Bush said, "and we're doing what we can to 
facilitate him in putting things back together as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Restoring law and order and breathing life into Endara's embryonic government, 
which has supplanted the regime of ousted strongman Manuel A. Noriega, have 
quickly moved to the top of the list of challenges facing the Administration in 
Panama. The two problems are now considered even more important than capturing 
the elusive Noriega, which originally was one of the main objectives of the 
U.S. assault. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said problems caused by roving bands of pro-Noriega 
Dignity Battalion youths and the disabled Panama Defense Forces have created 
substantially greater complications than were envisioned in planning the 
invasion. Under Noriega, the Defense Forces served as the country's police 
force as well as its military. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration had not anticipated either the extent of resistance mounted 
by the Dignity Battalion or the almost complete disintegration of the Defense 
Forces. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it has become clear that U.S. occupation forces will remain in Panama 
much longer than Administration officials originally expected. Although the 
timetable is uncertain, U.S. troops certainly will be there much longer than 
the month that Endara said he thought it would take to bring enough stability 
to allow his government to operate without U.S. military support. 
</P>
<P>
A senior Bush aide pointed out that after the Oct. 25, 1983, invasion of 
Grenada, "it took three months to get things up and running so troops could 
leave, and that was much simpler because there was nothing left there in the 
way of a Grenada military." 
</P>
<P>
Elements of the main U.S. invasion force began pulling out of Grenada about six 
weeks after invading, but an American peacekeeping force continued to patrol 
the tiny Caribbean country until June 12, l985. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials have tried to be discreet about the extent of the role 
they are playing in forming the Panamanian government -- a sensitive subject 
bound to further strain relations with Latin American countries that already 
have protested the U.S. invasion vehemently. 
</P>
<P>
But Army Lt. Gen. Thomas W. Kelly, director for operations for the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, in telling reporters that Panama's foreign, finance and health 
ministries had been seized, declared: "We have ministries that are cleared and 
hope to have ministers appointed soon and have them operating." 
</P>
<P>
Realizing the import of his words, Kelly quickly added, "When I say 'we,' I 
mean the Endara government." 
</P>
<P>
Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was 
even blunter in a television interview: 
</P>
<P>
"It would be disastrous to withdraw prematurely before we have put a stable 
government in place and a democratic government, and that is our main 
objective," he said. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, in a letter to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and 
Senate President Pro Tempore Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), said that while most 
organized opposition to U.S. forces has ceased, "it is not possible at this 
time to predict the precise scope and duration of the military operations or 
how long the temporary increase of U.S. forces in Panama will be required." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the letter was part of his effort to keep Congress informed 
"consistent with the War Powers Resolution," which Congress passed during the 
Vietnam War era to give it a role in the deployment of combat troops. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Kelly of the Joint Chiefs said the Panama Defense Forces have been 
"pretty well neutralized" and that mopping-up operations are under way. Even 
so, he said, "They are not easy." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly noted that Panama City is an old city with a metropolitan population of 1 
million and "a lot of places to hide." He said the mopping-up operations would 
take five to 10 days to complete. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a look at some history and found out that that is not an unrealistic 
number," he said. "It took us about 10 days some years ago to clear Detroit 
when we had a functioning government and police department, which we don't have 
in Panama right now." He was referring to the Detroit race riots of 1967, when 
military forces were called in to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of Congress expressed concern that the prominent U.S. role in 
setting up the Endara government, as well as the prospect of prolonged American 
military operations in Panama, will severely damage relations with other Latin 
American countries. 
</P>
<P>
After a closed-door Defense Department briefing on Capitol Hill, Sen. Sam Nunn 
(D-Ga.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said the United States 
should reduce its profile to avoid provoking anger or an anti-American 
backlash. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's important that we not become a permanent occupying force in 
reality or in perception," Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials insisted that Endara has been moving fairly quickly to 
organize his government, setting up operations in the Legislative Assembly 
building and appointing a number of ministers. 
</P>
<P>
They noted one positive step Friday: U.S. troops secured Panama's Central Bank, 
the Finance Ministry, the Health Ministry and the Foreign Ministry in addition 
to the Legislative Assembly building. 
</P>
<P>
"We're particularly concerned about the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry 
because they now can begin dealing with the money that will be needed for the 
economic development of the country," White House Press Secretary Marlin 
Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
An initial allotment of $100,000 has been released to Endara by the U.S. 
Treasury from an escrow account that was set up some time ago in connection 
with anti-Noriega sanctions imposed by Washington. The account, now containing 
an estimated $400 million, consists primarily of tolls from Panama Canal users 
that were withheld from Noriega's regime. 
</P>
<P>
Although providing Endara with funds may help, U.S. officials acknowledge that 
reconstituting the Panama Defense Forces has turned into a major problem that 
will require considerable time to solve. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials had anticipated a relatively high level of institutional loyalty 
among PDF members after combat died down. But thus far, most PDF members who 
were not shot or captured have been sitting on the sidelines instead of 
answering a call to return to service. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to reactivate the basic police structure, the Endara government 
not only issued an announcement that all police should report for duty, but 
declared that those who answered the call would receive their salaries. 
Paychecks were not issued this week, and the pay offer was seen as an incentive 
to report. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who are willing to serve this government are simply being asked to come 
in and report for duty," said one U.S. official closely involved in the effort. 
"The new government is being pressed to restore police services in the city. 
They're now trying hard to assemble a force there. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the new government is that concerned about (the loyalties of) 
traffic police and lower-level people in these services," he added. "If 
high-ranking officials report for duty, I think they would check them out 
pretty carefully." 
</P>
<P>
Some American MPs have been helping to provide services, in an advisory 
capacity, until the Panamanians can do a head count and reorganize the police 
force. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to their problems, officials have been unable to find or settle on a 
respected figure of authority to head the organization. U.S. defense officials 
said that at Endara's request, Eduardo Herrera Hassan, a former PDF colonel, 
was flown from America to Panama. But a Bush aide said that it is uncertain 
whether Herrera would lead a restructured Panamanian military. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Much of the continuing resistance to U.S. forces in Panama City comes from 
remnants of so-called Dignity Battalions, civilian paramilitary bands organized 
by Manuel A. Noriega as a kind of personal militia. U.S. Army Gen. Maxwell 
Thurman, chief of the Southern Command, says that each battalion is composed of 
about 300 people, most of them young men, and that there may be up to 
half-a-dozen battalions, totaling about 1,800 people. In today's Panama, 
Thurman says, elements of the battalions are operating in much smaller groups, 
of perhaps 10 or 12 people each. In some cases, they have been joined by 
members of Panama Defense Forces loyal to Noriega who have shed their uniforms 
and are now prowling the city in civilian clothing, Thurman said.

CONSERVATION PLANS DUSTED OFF BY DECEMBER DROUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK A. STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
MONTEREY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A decidedly dry December has evaporated hopes that October rains might have 
ended California's drought, and state water officials are starting to urge 
renewal of conservation programs and limited rationing in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit is the area from Monterey to Santa Barbara, where one reservoir has 
run dry, others have shrunk to as little as 12% of capacity and the ground 
water table has fallen "drastically" -- as much as 15 feet -- as wells are 
asked to work overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory cuts of 20% in water use have been made law in Monterey and Santa 
Barbara counties, with cuts of 40% only two or three months away. Elsewhere in 
the state, water agencies are dusting off conservation plans that were shelved 
after unseasonable storms of only a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the eve of the traditionally busy Christmas-New Year holiday, 
Sierra resorts have scaled back skiing and other snow activities. One southern 
Sierra facility may have a hard time opening its downhill runs at all, while 
Tahoe-area resorts will do so only by spreading a film of machine-produced snow 
over a thin base. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the drought information center in Sacramento reports that runoff has 
been a disappointing 65% of normal since September and reservoirs are well 
below half full. Central Valley farmers have been warned not to count on their 
usual irrigation supplies as that water is shifted to cities. 
</P>
<P>
"We are facing the driest December we've ever seen," said Larry Foy, vice 
president of the California-American Water Co. on the Monterey Peninsula. "We 
have not had a December entirely without rain -- ever -- and we have had no 
rain at all so far." 
</P>
<P>
The peninsula, including Monterey, Pacific Grove and Carmel, usually enjoys 
four inches of rain in December, about one-fifth of its annual total. 
Late-season rains in March and early rains in October were only enough to stem 
the fall in reservoir levels, not enough to raise them or ease restrictions, 
Foy said. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is worse in Santa Barbara, where the Gibraltar Reservoir near 
Montecito has been exhausted and Lake Cachuma is at its lowest point ever, 30% 
of capacity. Local officials there have been worried enough to consider -- and, 
for now, reject -- a costly plan to import water from Canada in tanker ships. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Helms of the state Department of Water Resources said a number of other 
regions of the state, including the San Joaquin Valley and Tulare Basin, are 
also "critically dry" and must get rain this year to avoid serious and -- in 
the case of overdrafted aquifers where pesticides and fertilizers are being 
concentrated -- perhaps permanent problems. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that it started well, but it hasn't kept pace with what it 
should have," Helms said of the current rainy season, which had a promisingly 
drizzly debut in September but then slid into a dismal series of sunny days. 
</P>
<P>
Clear skies not only meant no rain, they meant dry winter winds are free to eat 
voraciously at the Sierra snowpack and thus threaten runoff in the spring. 
Helms said the statewide snowpack dipped from above average in October to only 
35% of normal at the beginning of December. 
</P>
<P>
It has been shrinking daily since, as resort operators know. Badger Pass in 
Yosemite National Park, for example, indefinitely delayed the traditional Dec. 
10 opening of its downhill runs for lack of snow and has limited cross-country 
skiing to 20 kilometers of trails. The park has trimmed back the number of 
snowshoe excursions, although ice skating is said to be exceptional. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all of this, Helms said it's "too early to panic." Just ahead lie the 
typically soggy months of January and February, and he noted that "a lot can 
happen in a short time." In 1986, for example, the state received half of its 
normal annual precipitation in just 10 stormy days. Also, the construction of 
several major dams and reservoirs makes it unlikely that the state will suffer 
as much as it did during the 1976-77 drought. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Bowman, a forecaster for the private WeatherData Inc. in Wichita, Kan., 
said there is some promise of rain early in January if a storm system forming 
in the mid-Pacific gains enough strength to muscle through the stubborn 
high-pressure ridge that has diverted other storms north to Oregon, Washington 
and western Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"It (rain) does look more likely early in January than in any time in the past 
month," he said. Because the system would not arrive for 10 to 12 days, it is 
difficult to predict accurately how much rain, if any, it will bring or how far 
south rains might fall. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't have a real high probability of happening," he said, "but it is 
better than flipping a coin." 
</P>
<P>
The high-altitude high-pressure ridge blocking winter storms from the state 
also generated the prolonged period of Santa Ana winds that whipped Southern 
California this fall, Bowman said. But, he added, the winds themselves were not 
responsible for the lack of rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
If it is too early to panic, Helms said it is not too early to be concerned -- 
and vigilant about conserving. Surface supplies, at 44% of capacity, must be 
used sparingly because no one knows when rain will return to normal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Helms said Lake Oroville -- the main source of Northern California water for 
homes and businesses in metropolitan Southern California -- is 1 million 
acre-feet below what he said is its preferred level. One acre-foot contains 
325,800 gallons, a year's supply for a suburban family of four. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara relies on Lake Cachuma for most of its water needs. That lake was 
designed to tolerate a seven-year drought, the longest-known when the reservoir 
was created. But James Stubchaer, a consultant for the Santa Barbara County 
Water Purveyors Assn., said the county has not had an adequate wet year in six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have enough -- barely -- to maybe tolerate one more year (of drought)," 
Stubchaer said. "The problem is we don't know if (the drought) will last six 
years or seven -- or eight or more." 
</P>
<P>
Because of this, cuts may have to slice deeper than the relatively painless 
adjustments already accomplished -- the attachment of low-flow shower heads and 
retirement of yard sprinklers, water managers said. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people have already let their lawns go and are now just trying to save 
their plants, often with rinse water from dishwashers or washing machines or 
even showers," said Foy of the Monterey water company. 
</P>
<P>
He said the storied Pebble Beach golf links have managed to keep their greens 
green, but the roughs have "gone brown" and only limited parts of the fairways 
are regularly watered. 
</P>
<P>
"If it doesn't rain here by the end of February, we may see mandatory cuts of 
40%," Stubchaer added. "If it doesn't rain by the end of May -- who knows -- it 
may be more."

<TEXT>
<P>
The Warsaw Pact's last Stalinist domino, the tyrannical regime of Romanian 
President Nicolae Ceausescu, toppled with a violent crash Friday after several 
days of Europe's bloodiest fighting since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
A newly formed Council of the Front of National Salvation, composed mostly of 
known Romanian dissidents and the army's chief of staff, announced on Radio 
Bucharest shortly before midnight that it had taken over until free elections 
can be held next April. 
</P>
<P>
Even as they spoke, however, sporadic automatic weapons fire was reported 
continuing in the capital as pro-Ceausescu forces counterattacked in an 
apparently doomed, last-ditch effort to overturn the popular uprising, which 
had grown from a few hundred people to millions in less than a week. 
</P>
<P>
Pictures broadcast by Romanian television, which had been taken over by 
anti-Ceausescu forces earlier Friday, showed what appeared to be thousands of 
civilians apparently trapped in the crossfire as rival security units battled 
in the center of the city. Soviet television reported "hundreds dead in the 
streets." 
</P>
<P>
Television also aired footage that showed residents in the western city of 
Timisoara digging up three mass graves where thousands of victims of last 
weekend's crackdown are believed to be buried. 
</P>
<P>
In Bucharest, the lavish presidential palace, from which the 71-year-old 
dictator and his wife, Elena, had ruled like medieval potentates for 24 years 
before they fled by helicopter at about noon Friday, was ablaze, as was part of 
the Communist Party headquarters building. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu's whereabouts was still a mystery after conflicting reports by the 
newly liberated Romanian media, which were monitored in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Romanian television reported that he and Elena, who was also his second in 
command, had left the country for an undetermined destination. But Radio 
Bucharest, which was also in the opposition's hands, reported at various times 
that he had been captured, escaped, then captured again. 
</P>
<P>
The station also reported late Friday that some of the pro-regime forces had 
surrendered, and the fighting was dying down. But other die-hards were said to 
be moving through secret tunnels beneath the city, and pockets of resistance 
remained. 
</P>
<P>
Early today, Bucharest Radio reported that the head of the dreaded Securitate 
secret security force, which has remained loyal to Ceausescu, switched 
allegiance and ordered his forces to give up their arms and back the revolt. 
</P>
<P>
The report, monitored in Vienna, said that Gen. Iulien Vlad was "with the 
people" and "orders all security troops to ally themselves with the army and 
the people." 
</P>
<P>
It also said that Interior Minister Tudor Postelnicu and First Deputy Prime 
Minister Ion Dinca, a Politburo member and one of Ceausescu's most trusted men, 
had been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
There were reports, too, of fighting in other cities, including Timisoara, the 
western provincial city where the anti-Ceausescu protests began last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
A Bucharest-based British diplomat, in a live telephone interview broadcast by 
Independent Television News, appealed for Western relief agencies to send 
emergency medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
State radio broadcast repeated appeals for Romanians to detain the fleeing 
dictator, alerting listeners near dusk that he was headed toward Pitesti, 
northwest of Bucharest, in a red jeep with a broken front window -- license 
plate number ARO244. 
</P>
<P>
The official Soviet news agency Tass said he had used at least two automobiles 
as well as the helicopter in his attempted escape. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu's son, Nicu, said to be a leader of Friday's counterattack by 
pro-regime security forces, was captured by protesters and shown on national 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Romanian TV and the state news agency Agerpres said the younger Ceausescu had 
been captured after trying to assume command of the security forces in Sibiu, 
where there had been reports of fierce fighting between security forces and 
rebellious troops. 
</P>
<P>
His face showed signs of bruising around the left eye, but he appeared in far 
better shape than two badly beaten students introduced earlier to underline the 
viciousness of the regime's death throes. 
</P>
<P>
While the casualty toll from six days of fighting is still unknown, the first 
Western reporters to reach Timisoara were told by residents that between 2,000 
and 4,500 had died there, many of them buried naked in three mass graves near 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Television showed citizens exhuming dozens of bodies, their feet bound with 
barbed wire, from the graves. 
</P>
<P>
Slobodan Kreckovic, the Yugoslav vice consul in Timisoara, told the British 
news agency Reuters: "The crimes which have been committed here are beyond 
description." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the mood in western Romanian cities visited by reporters after 
the country's border was opened Friday afternoon was one of jubilation. 
Television footage showed Romanians dancing in the streets of Arad. In 
Timisoara, tens of thousands covered the central square at an evening rally. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the situation was less clear, with reports of battles pitting 
members of the special security forces under command of the Securitate secret 
police network against demonstrators and army units defending them in Sibiu, 
Brasov and other cities as well as in Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
Sibiu was Nicu Ceausescu's power base, and Brasov was the site of 
anti-government demonstrations in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
British diplomat Jonathan Lamb said in the ITN television interview that the 
pro-regime forces are probably fighting more to save their own skins than to 
bring back Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
"I assume that the Securitate are fighting desperately to save their own lives, 
because they know that if they don't kill, then they'll be killed themselves," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
In a printed message flashed across the TV screen, Romanian television warned 
that drinking water in Timisoara and Sibiu may have been poisoned, presumably 
by pro-regime forces. There was no confirmation that water supplies had 
actually been sabotaged, but the warning was in itself an indication of the 
extraordinary tension in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Bucharest Radio appealed for all medical workers to remain on the job, calling 
them "the army in white uniform," and asking them to help prevent epidemics. 
</P>
<P>
The thousands reportedly killed during Romania's stunning, weeklong rebellion 
was all the more notable for having challenged what has long been the Warsaw 
Pact's most brutal regime and dictatorial regime. 
</P>
<P>
While one after the other of Moscow's one-time satellites in Eastern Europe 
have overthrown single-party rule this year with virtually no violence, 
Ceausescu had scorned reform. His was a country in which the power supply could 
not support more than one 40-watt light bulb per room, and where a woman could 
go to jail for using a contraceptive. Opponents frequently just disappeared, 
never to be seen again. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how they put up with it, Romanians themselves used to occasionally cite 
an old proverb: "The bent head avoids the sword." But in the end, spurred on by 
the success of neighboring countries in dislodging the Communist monopoly of 
power, they held their heads high against the regime's bullets and bayonets. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should spare a thought for the very courageous people who just 
weren't prepared to knuckle under against a blood-stained tyranny, and who led 
the protest and paid for it with their lives," British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher said after hearing of Ceausescu's ouster. "They'll be real heroes in 
Romania's history." 
</P>
<P>
The Romanian unrest began last weekend when residents of Timisoara tried to 
defend the Rev. Laszlo Toekes, an ethnic Hungarian Protestant minister, who was 
threatened with arrest. Protests grew until Sunday night, when security forces 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
As word of the resulting massacre spread through the country, so did 
anti-government demonstrations. Ceausescu, who had demonstrated his supposed 
lack of concern by going ahead with a state visit to Iran, returned to 
Bucharest on Wednesday and ordered a state of emergency imposed in Timisoara. 
</P>
<P>
But it was already too late. Speaking to what was supposed to be a friendly 
"rent-a-crowd" during a televised address in the capital Thursday, the 
self-proclaimed "Genius of the Carpathians" was clearly stunned when shouted 
down by protesters. 
</P>
<P>
Clashes between security forces and demonstrators followed, leaving up to 50 
more people dead in Bucharest Thursday afternoon and night. There were also 
fatal clashes reported in Cluj and other cities as protests spread across the 
country through the night. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday morning, Ceausescu declared a general state of emergency throughout 
the country. State radio, still under his control, announced the alleged 
suicide of Defense Minister Vasile Milea, reporting that he blamed himself for 
the unrest. The claim later was denied by by an unidentified army general, who 
implied that Milea had been executed. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds continued to build, and at about noon Bucharest time, state television 
reporter Emanuel Valeriu telephoned Radio Free Europe headquarters in Munich to 
say that Ceausescu had been deposed. Demonstrators had penetrated to his office 
and were throwing his papers out the window even as the dictator fled from the 
roof by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, Radio Moscow announced: "The dictator has fallen." 
</P>
<P>
The mood through most of the afternoon Friday was "peaceful and jubilant," 
according to Agota Kuperman, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest 
interviewed by telephone. "Thousands of people were on the street. They were 
enjoying their new-found liberty." 
</P>
<P>
Early Friday afternoon, the anti-Ceausescu forces took over state television. A 
former Romanian foreign minister-turned-dissident, Corneliu Manescu, suddenly 
appeared, surrounded by dozens of male colleagues in the main broadcasting 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
Trembling with emotion, Manescu, 73, called on "the entire population to go out 
into the street; to go to your local government buildings and to occupy them 
without force." 
</P>
<P>
And he appealed to members of the armed forces: "Do not use your weapons. Do 
not shoot people. You are Romanians like all of us. The same heart beats in 
your breast as in our breasts." 
</P>
<P>
Manescu was later named as a member of the Front of National Salvation's 
governing council. Others include: Ion Iliescu, a former party leader ousted by 
Ceausescu in 1971 and the group's spokesman during Friday night's announcement; 
Doina Cornea, 60, a French teacher from Cluj recently put under house arrest 
and beaten by police for her outspoken support of human and religious rights; 
Mircea Dinescu, a dissident poet; Toekes, the minister whose arrest triggered 
the uprising; Silviu Brucan, a former ambassador to the United States who 
earlier this year joined five other former Communists in signing a public 
protest against Ceausescu; and Dumitru Mazilu, author of a critical report to 
the United Nations on Romanian human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to free elections in April, the program that the Front announced 
Friday night pledged that Romania will remain in the Warsaw Pact, but as a 
multi-party democracy under a new name. Henceforth, they said, the country will 
no longer be the Socialist Republic of Romania, but simply Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Their program also calls for removing Communist ideology from the educational 
curriculum, freedom of the press, equal rights for minorities and an end to 
exports of food and petrochemical products in order to improve supplies to 23 
million cold and poorly nourished Romanians. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters turned Romanian television and radio into a dramatic, running 
commentary on the day's extraordinary events. 
</P>
<P>
At first the scene was chaotic, but exhilarating, as amateur speaker after 
amateur speaker criticized the regime and pledged allegiance to the new order. 
</P>
<P>
"Ceausescu has pushed the country into economic catastrophe," said an 
unidentified man angrily. "He's guilty of odious crimes against the people. 
He's a heartless man who ruled with medieval methods." 
</P>
<P>
"I tell you from the soul of the Romanian army that no one will fire upon the 
Romanian people," promised an unnamed military officer. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time, an unidentified voice announced over Bucharest Radio: 
"Brothers! With God's help, we are now in the radio station. We have arrived 
here with the support of tanks, the army, and thousands of Romanians. . . . 
After 40 years of lies, listen, Romanian brothers, to the voice of truth." 
</P>
<P>
By 3 p.m., army Col. Nicolae Militaru apologized over state radio for the 
Romanian army's involvement "in this crime. . . . Children, women, many people, 
totally innocent people, died." And he appealed to a number of army generals, 
by name, to "stop the slaughter." 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, Radio Bucharest announced that fighting was under way in 
Sibiu and said the army was calling for help "because its members are being 
killed by the security forces." 
</P>
<P>
And as darkness fell, the radio appealed for the army and civilians to come 
protect the broadcasting center from a 2,000-member pro-Ceausescu force heading 
in its direction. Early today, power at the television station was cut and the 
sound of gunfire was heard from the building, according to Budapest television. 
Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency reported late Friday that forces loyal to 
Ceausescu shot their way into the station, but rebel army units beat them back. 
</P>
<P>
The situation among Romania's various military forces was not immediately 
clear, in part because special internal security troops wear uniforms very 
similar to those of the mostly conscript army. 
</P>
<P>
According to London's International Institute for Strategic Studies, Romania's 
regular defense forces, including army, navy and air force, total about 170,000 
men. There are also about 20,000 border guards who are attached to the Ministry 
of the Interior, which also controls the national police. 
</P>
<P>
Another 20,000 special internal security troops technically fall under the 
Ministry of the Interior as well, but are believed actually to be under the 
control of the dreaded Securitate secret police. These troops are said to have 
equipment comparable or better than that of the regular army. 
</P>
<P>
The largest armed force in the country is the so-called Patriotic Guard, a 
workers' militia that serves as a military adjunct to the Communist Party.

PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Armed bands said by U.S. military officials to be directed by ousted dictator 
Manuel A. Noriega staged a bloody attack Friday in downtown Panama City near 
the American military headquarters and frustrated efforts by U.S. troops to 
pacify this city. 
</P>
<P>
Firing mortars, machine guns and automatic rifles, the attackers hit Panama's 
national police headquarters, less than a mile from the headquarters of the 
U.S. Southern Command, about 11:30 a.m., catching American forces by surprise 
and causing confusion for at least 10 minutes and leaving several people 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
The assault came shortly after a U.S. Army briefing officer told reporters that 
"gunfire has diminished and the situation is much quieter in the last several 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
Sporadic shooting continued while U.S. Special Forces and helicopter gunships 
searched out the attackers. 
</P>
<P>
Three days after nearly 10,000 U.S. troops invaded Panama and drove Noriega 
into hiding, the continued bloody resistance by his forces mocked claims by 
American officials, from President Bush downward, that the situation is well in 
hand and U.S. troops are "mopping up." 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, reporters in the city as well as residents and other 
eyewitnesses saw such continuous violence and looting, that the city appeared 
in virtual anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Support for that assessment came Friday night from Air Force Col. Ronald 
Sconyers, chief Southern Command spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a war out there," he said, as he tried to persuade reporters to return to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
One U.S. soldier was killed in action Friday, military officials said. After 
revising a previous count, they said the total number of U.S. servicemen killed 
since the operation began about 1 a.m. Wednesday stood at 21. In addition, two 
civilian dependents have been killed, officials said. They added that more than 
240 U.S. servicemen have been wounded and four are missing. 
</P>
<P>
On the Panamanian side, U.S. officials said that 127 troops have been killed in 
action and 69 wounded. There has been no official count of Panamanian civilians 
killed or wounded during the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Santo Tomas Hospital in Panama City reported that 100 bodies are 
stored there, and Gorgas Hospital said it has 60 more. 
</P>
<P>
For yet another day, Noriega eluded intense American efforts to apprehend him, 
frustrating one of President Bush's major goals in invading this country. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Maxwell Thurman, head of the Southern Command, said that Noriega, 54, was 
commanding his supporters in hit and run tactics that the U.S. officer 
described as "terrorism. . . . It is my feeling that this is centrally 
controlled" by Noriega and "that some people will rally to him" until he is 
captured. 
</P>
<P>
The tactics of the Noriega loyalists frustrated nearly all of the expressed 
goals of U.S. planners for the operation. In spite of the destruction of 
Panama's military headquarters and the capture by American troops of nearly 
every major Panama military base, more than 13,000 of the estimated 15,000 
members of Noriega's Panama Defense Forces remained at large. 
</P>
<P>
American troop commanders said that it could take up to 10 days to crush the 
resistance and restore order. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon on Friday dispatched 2,000 fresh troops from the 7th Infantry 
Division at Ft. Ord, Calif., to supplement the 22,500 U.S. troops already in 
Panama, officials in Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the attack on police headquarters near the Southern Command's 
headquarters at Quarry Heights, there were sporadic attacks by the fugitive 
dictator's supporters at the Legislative Assembly building and a police station 
near the Panama Canal Commission headquarters in the Balboa section of the 
city. A mortar also struck and set fire to a U.S. Navy warehouse at water's 
edge, across the Panama Canal from Rodman Naval Station. 
</P>
<P>
While the capital of Panama remained in a state of near-anarchy, U.S. officials 
in Washington said that order was gradually being restored. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to do what is necessary to help the people of Panama achieve 
the democratic society that they voted for and that they so rightfully 
deserve," President Bush declared during a speech at the National Institutes of 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what our American soldiers are achieving -- freedom and human liberty 
for those who have endured brutal tyranny and brutal oppression," he said. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. troops had secured the 
Legislative Assembly building, where Guillermo Endara, who was installed as 
president on a U.S. military base minutes before the invasion began, 
established his offices. 
</P>
<P>
But as Ricardo Arias Calderon, one of Endara's vice presidents, was leaving the 
Assembly building Friday, members of one of Noriega's paramilitary Dignity 
Battalions shot at his car. Arias was uninjured, but two of his aides were 
wounded, an Arias aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said that U.S. forces also had secured the Foreign Ministry, the 
Health Ministry, the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"We're particularly concerned about the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry 
because they now can begin dealing with the money that will be needed for the 
economic development of the country," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
But elsewhere in Panama City, U.S. officials said they had much work ahead of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not cleared this area out," said Col. Mike Snell, escorting reporters 
on a tour of a neighborhood that housed the bombed-out headquarters of the 
Panama Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still people with weapons around. To secure this area totally is 
going to take months of work and a combination of military and other forces," 
he said. "Everybody downtown has a gun." 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Thurman of the Southern Command blamed Noriega's Dignity Battalions -- 
paramilitary militiamen often described by American officials as "thugs" -- for 
much of the continuing violence. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of (members of) Dignity Battalions are loose in the city," he told a 
news conference at his headquarters, "and we are having to work hard to get 
those particular units under control." 
</P>
<P>
At a Pentagon news briefing in Washington, Army Lt. Gen. Thomas W. Kelly, 
director for operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said of the Dignity 
Battalions: "They're looting, sniping. They are lawless. There are some others 
who are lawless. However, we have been able to make some progress. We have the 
82nd Airborne in the city moving from northeast to southwest; the 193rd Brigade 
with elements of the 6th MP Company moving from southwest to northeast. At some 
point they'll link up." 
</P>
<P>
As U.S. troops made their way through the city, they were frequently greeted 
with the "V" for victory sign. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of people cheering us on and clapping. They are on our side," 
said Lance Cpl. Tracy Scott Jones, 24, a Marine from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Large areas of the city were in chaos. Residents in many sections said that 
armed civilians were roaming the streets at will, firing indiscriminately into 
houses, stealing cars and robbing people. 
</P>
<P>
"In four days we haven't seen one American soldier," said a woman who called 
into an English-language radio station. "We are being terrorized, but no one 
will help us." 
</P>
<P>
Looting and wide-spread property destruction continued as the city went without 
police protection. All of Panama's police are part of the now disorganized and 
scattered Panama Defense Forces, the nation's sole military and security 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
The central Panama City area was so insecure that Gen. Thurman was unable to 
leave his Quarry Heights headquarters for a news conference scheduled at Howard 
Air Base across the Panama Canal, normally a 20-minute drive. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials and enlisted men said planes landing at Howard, the area's 
major air facility, were regularly fired on as they landed. A chartered jet 
carrying about 175 reporters from Miami on Friday morning was hit by small arms 
fire. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
However, at least one giant C-141 cargo plane was damaged badly on its approach 
and another came under heavy fire from a densely-wooded area overlooking the 
runway when it skidded into the mud. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers and condition of Americans who may be held hostage by Noriega 
loyalists remained unclear. CBS News producer Jon Meyersohn was still missing 
Friday after having been abducted Wednesday from the Marriott Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
In soccer stadiums, churches and schools, thousands of refugees took cover from 
the fighting. A Red Cross worker said that the relief agency has water but that 
it is running short of food. Gen. Kelly in Washington said that U.S. planes 
with food, medicine and other necessary supplies will be dispatched to Panama 
by today. 
</P>
<P>
In the ravaged city, supermarkets and other stores were empty, victims of a 
binge of looting that cleared out furniture stores, car lots and nearly all 
other retail establishments, and garbage rotted on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Thurman said that $1-million reward that Bush has offered for information 
leading to the capture of Noriega "is producing a substantial number of bits of 
information on his whereabouts." 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials, who initially expressed optimism about finding the 
Panamanian leader, displayed no such views Friday, declaring that they had no 
idea when he might be captured. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Noriega's ability to elude his pursuers, support for the U.S. operation 
showed no signs of abating at home. 
</P>
<P>
As poll after poll showed overwhelming public support, Senate Armed Services 
Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), ranking 
Republican on the panel, emerged from a three-hour briefing with Defense 
Department officials expressing even greater support for the invasion than they 
had announced earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"This morning's hearing added another dimension," Nunn said. "Gen. Noriega has 
been acting irrationally. He was given an opportunity to leave the country. 
President Bush had very good reason to believe things were going to get worse." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn and Warner said that there were diplomatic efforts by the United States 
and other countries to persuade Noriega to leave Panama with assurances that he 
would not be prosecuted on U.S. drug charges if he moved to a country that did 
not have an extradition treaty with the United States. However, Noriega 
rejected those attempts, which immediately preceded the invasion, the senators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"His psychology and neurotic condition didn't allow him to take heed," Warner 
said. "He pursued the resistant course that he had been following." 
</P>
<P>
Warner said evidence also showed that Noriega was arming as many as 250 Dignity 
Battalion members to attack Americans in their living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush flew to Camp David at mid-day after his morning speech to begin 
an 11-day holiday there and in Texas, where he plans to visit service personnel 
wounded in Panama who are being treated in military hospitals in San Antonio.

1,500 POWS TO BE SCREENED AT U.S. CAMPS;

CAPTIVES: SOME IN CUSTODY ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE CLOSE TIES TO NORIEGA.

<P>
U.S. authorities are preparing to set up prisoner of war camps where the 1,500 
members of the Panama Defense Forces now in custody can be screened to 
determine who might help form a new Panamanian army and who might be prosecuted 
as drug traffickers, Administration sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We are providing POW protection for each one until the precise status of each 
individual soldier can be ascertained," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
Among those believed to be in custody are a number of men with close ties to 
ousted dictator Manuel A. Noriega, four of whom have been indicted in the 
United States on drug charges along with Noriega, a Justice Department official 
added. 
</P>
<P>
"Those four clearly are people we want to take custody of, and we will be 
interviewing others that we have outstanding cases against -- people who figure 
in ongoing investigations," said David Runkel, a special assistant to U.S. 
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The task of restructuring the PDF -- including rooting out corruption -- is 
among the foremost challenges confronting the Bush Administration. With about 
14,000 members, the PDF has served not only as Panama's army but also as its 
police force. 
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the plan to set up prisoner of war camps conceded Friday 
that the Administration harbors few illusions about the difficulties of trying 
screen the Panamanian soldiers in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a delicate procedure if we're trying to restore the Panamanian 
government," one Administration source said. He said the soldiers probably will 
break down into three categories: 
</P>
<P>
"One, there may have been some good soldiers who did nothing. They will be 
released to the new government as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Two, if the government believes some are Noriega loyalists, they may be kept 
for awhile. 
</P>
<P>
"The third group are those who may have been involved in the drug business. We 
have to determine whether we want to bring them back to the U.S. for 
prosecution or turn them over for prosecution in Panama." 
</P>
<P>
But, the source continued, "we don't want to run a camp for a lot of people for 
a prolonged period. No one wants the U.S. to be seen running a concentration 
camp." 
</P>
<P>
He conceded that the process could take "months and months." 
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon source said that it may not be easy for authorities to decipher a 
Panamanian soldier's true sympathies. "An awful lot of people are going to 
claim to have seen the light. Do we believe those who claim to have seen the 
light? It's going to be hard to tell who's really trustworthy and who's not." 
</P>
<P>
Another Administration source declared: "It's going to be an arduous and 
prolonged process." 
</P>
<P>
David Isenberg, a research analyst at the Center for Defense Information here, 
agreed that the plan could take many weeks. Until a new PDF is reconstituted, 
he said, a peacekeeping force from either the United Nations or the 
Organization of American States might be a palatable alternative to the 
continued large presence of U.S. forces in Panama.

CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT HAS LONG BEEN MERE FACADE FOR RULE BY THE MILITARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since the late Arnulfo Arias Madrid, Panama's last honestly elected 
president, was deposed by the old National Guard in October, 1968, civilian 
government in that country has functioned as a facade for military rule. 
</P>
<P>
A so-called National Assembly of Representatives, a body of 510 elected 
community delegates, drafted a new constitution in 1972 and named a civilian to 
be president. But it gave dictatorial powers to Gen. Omar Torrijos, the 
National Guard officer who had emerged as the nation's ruler after the 1968 
coup. Torrijos was killed in an aviation accident in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, Torrijos' chief of intelligence, Manuel A. Noriega, became 
commander of the National Guard -- by then renamed the Panama Defense Forces -- 
and effective ruler of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
So-called democracy under the 1972 constitution was restored in 1984 with the 
election of a civilian president and a 67-member unicameral Legislative 
Assembly in tainted balloting. But Noriega remained the boss, ousting every 
civilian president who crossed him and reducing the Legislative Assembly to a 
rubber-stamp function. 
</P>
<P>
When last May's elections appeared likely to give Noriega's foes the presidency 
and significant influence in the Legislative Assembly, the dictator annulled 
the elections. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Noriega sought to give his rule constitutional legitimacy by 
reviving the old National Assembly of Representatives (sometimes called the 
People's Assembly in Panama). 
</P>
<P>
That body made Noriega its president Nov. 22, and on Dec. 15, it proclaimed him 
"head of government" of Panama and declared Panama to be "in a state of war" 
with the United States.

DARING U.S. AIRBORNE ASSAULT MAY REWRITE MILITARY TEXTBOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the first of 4,500 U.S. paratroopers dropped out of the early-morning sky 
at Panama's Torrijos International Airport on Wednesday, it marked the opening 
of a daring and unprecedented assault that military analysts believe will be 
studied as a textbook case for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
From a strategic standpoint, the attack was executed with planning and 
precision that analysts called particularly remarkable because of the vast 
distance covered by the troops, who were flown in from the United States, and 
the complexity of their mission. 
</P>
<P>
Experts stressed that their appraisals dealt only with the technical military 
aspects of the operation, not the policy issues behind President Bush's 
decision to order the assault -- much less the potential political controversy 
that may erupt at home if order is not quickly restored in Panama and sporadic 
fighting continues, even if at a militarily insignificant level. 
</P>
<P>
That being said, considered purely in terms of military operations, the 
Pentagon's handling of the massive assault appears to have been a considerable 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Waves of paratroopers, helicopter-borne Green Berets and Navy commandos mounted 
a multipronged assault aimed at neutralizing the headquarters and the most 
loyal battalions of the Panamanian armed forces. The paratroops were among 
nearly 10,000 troops airlifted as far as 3,500 miles from Ft. Ord in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Until this week, the major surprise attacks in modern military history have 
been launched from much shorter distances and relied for transportation 
primarily on ships. The Allied invasion of Normandy, perhaps history's greatest 
military surprise since the Trojan Horse, involved crossing about a 75-mile 
stretch of the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
"To go on the offensive, to project troops that far, it's a classic," one Army 
general said. "You'll be reading about it in military histories for a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The scale of Operation Just Cause is also dwarfed by the 1950 Inchon landing at 
Inchon, in which 261 vessels put 40,000 U.S. Marine and Army troops ashore on a 
spit of land south of Seoul during the Korean war -- a daring end-run that cut 
off thousands of enemy troops. Gen. Douglas MacArthur's famous landing, staged 
from ships offshore, is considered a brilliant example of surprise and the use 
of amphibious tactics. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a slow-motion, short-range event compared to Wednesday morning's 
timed-to-the-minute, long-distance projection of force by air. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts outside the government tended to agree with the Defense Department's 
claims that the assault achieved its primary goal of cutting off the Panamanian 
military from its leader, Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, even if it failed to capture 
Noriega himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a hard time believing that the strategy was to capture Noriega, because 
that was iffy to begin with," said a retired Army general. "They expected that 
he would not be caught, and that is one of the reasons they used so much force. 
When you put 15,000 or 20,000 troops into a battle, you practically eliminate 
the possibility of failure in the overall goal." 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts said there is no precise precedent for this type of military 
strike in U.S. history. The 1965 invasion of the Dominican Republic was the 
closest parallel, but it occurred over a longer time period, and the first 
contingent was only 405 Marines. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing even resembling this in major U.S. wars, from World War II to 
Korea and Vietnam," said the retired general, who asked that his name not be 
used. 
</P>
<P>
The most dramatic strategic element of the Panama assault recalled elements of 
another, far more massive surprise action -- the invasion of Normandy by more 
than 100,000 Allied troops on June 6, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
As in Panama, paratroopers were a key component of the Normandy plan, and 
members of the 82nd Airborne division participated in both. And as in Panama, 
they landed at night after jumping out of airplanes -- already a high-risk 
enterprise -- becomes far more dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
To some military experts, the successful parachute drop by the 82nd Airborne 
Division's Ready Brigade in Panama symbolized the precision of the entire 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
"Night drops of parachutists are enormously difficult and complicated, so this 
was a rather hairy operation," said retired Army Col. Harry Summers, a 
specialist in military strategy. "Because this difficult operation went well, 
it is a good sign that the planning for the entire operation was pretty sound." 
</P>
<P>
Summers also praised the isolation of the central elements of the Panamanian 
Defense Forces as another sign of good planning and execution. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the overall effectiveness, Summers said that he saw two substantial 
mistakes -- the failure to secure the Marriott Hotel in Panama City, where 
Noriega forces seized a number of Americans as hostages, and the failure to 
immediately knock out the city's radio transmitter. 
</P>
<P>
"Taking out the radio transmitter would have been easy with smart munitions," 
Summers said. "They could set the frequency of the radio transmitter on the 
bomb and blow it away. But it was in a heavily populated area, and they felt 
the number of civilian casualties would be too great." 
</P>
<P>
However, he suggested that a ground force should have been assigned to destroy 
the transmitter as a top priority to prevent Noriega from trying to rally the 
nation, as he attempted to a few hours after the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"The failure to secure the Marriott Hotel was a significant failure," he added. 
"The American people were getting their news from journalists there who were 
very scared, with good cause, and all the successes were being lost." 
</P>
<P>
The attack has been described in some quarters as overkill, with critics 
contending that the U.S. force -- about 22,500 troops in all, including roughly 
13,000 already stationed in Panama -- was far larger than necessary. Many of 
them argued that a "surgical strike" involving a smaller number of troops would 
have been more effective as well as more politically palatable. 
</P>
<P>
However, Summers and others said that the size of the force was necessary to 
ensure success when trying to control the far-flung forces of the PDF. Summers 
insisted that the notion surgical strikes are effective is more illusion than 
reality.

The Fighting 
</P>
<P>
Armed bands said by U.S. military officials to be directed by ousted dictator 
Manuel A. Noriega staged a bloody attack less than a mile from the American 
military headquarters. Firing mortars, machine guns and automatic rifles, the 
attackers hit Panama's national police headquarters. American forces were 
caught by surprise and several people were wounded amid the confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Panama City 
</P>
<P>
Looters ransacked stores for the third day. Refugees fleeing the fighting took 
cover in soccer stadiums, churches and schools. Noriega loyalists tried to 
assassinate Ricardo Arias Calderon, Panamanian vice president installed by the 
United States. He was not injured. Several pro-Noriega bands surrendered in 
western Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 
</P>
<P>
President Bush told Congress it was impossible to predict the "scope and 
duration" of the U.S. intervention. The Organization of American States said in 
Washington it "deeply deplored" the invasion and called for withdrawal of 
American forces. 
</P>
<P>
Casualties 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one American troops and two female dependents have been killed, 202 
wounded, and two soldiers and one civilian are missing. U.S. officials said 127 
Panamanian soldiers were killed and 69 wounded.

American diplomats, hoping to foster a climate of warmer relations between 
Washington and Moscow, began keeping Soviet officials closely advised of the 
course of events in Panama days before the incursion and continue to brief 
Kremlin officials several times daily, U.S. sources in Moscow said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The degree of communication between Soviet and American officials has occurred 
at all levels and took place with increasing detail and intensity at least two 
days before the American intervention into Panama, reflecting deep concern in 
Washington that nothing upset the new style of cooperation between the two 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
And, for the most part, keeping the Soviets closely advised is a tactic that 
has worked, according to American officials here. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the tough rhetoric coming from the Kremlin, Soviet officials have made 
it clear that U.S.-Soviet relations will not be damaged because of the military 
intervention, the American diplomats say. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Soviet citizens Friday expressed their anger over the events in 
Panama, demonstrating in front of the U.S. Embassy. Some carried signs that 
read "Hands Off Panama." 
</P>
<P>
For the third day in a row, the official Tass news agency made highly critical 
comments on the U.S. actions, saying: "American-style democracy is being 
imposed on Panama by army helicopters, tanks and armored carriers. . . . The 
White House has found itself isolated again." 
</P>
<P>
But stern statements by the government and in the official media, according to 
one senior U.S. official, are simply "a matter of image." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they are all that upset. But they don't want to be seen as being 
in collusion with us," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
That is particularly important for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who 
reportedly has been accused by conservatives of putting good relations with the 
West before ideological concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Georgy A. Arbatov, a key Kremlin adviser on East-West relations, called the 
American incursion "the best Christmas present the Americans could have given 
the Soviet military machine." 
</P>
<P>
It would strengthen the hand of those in Soviet military and political circles 
who argue that the Soviet Union should not move so quickly to make unilateral 
disarmament agreements, he told reporters during a break in the current session 
of the Congress of Peoples' Deputies. 
</P>
<P>
An attempt to deflect potential criticism from conservatives may be a key 
factor behind the tough wording of the official Soviet response to Panama, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a bit surprised by the tone and degree of their public criticism," one 
American political analyst said of the initial Soviet response to Panama. "It 
was more aggressive than we might have expected. 
</P>
<P>
"But, based on our private conversations, we see no long-term, substantive 
problems between Washington and Moscow because of this," the analyst said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
A flurry of meetings "at a number of levels" were held in Moscow on Tuesday, 
before American troops intervened in Panama, one American diplomat said. While 
the Soviets were not provided with exact details of the American plans, "the 
news that we had sent in troops came as no surprise to them," the diplomat 
added. 
</P>
<P>
"We took the initiative to go in and provide an explanation," another senior 
official explained. "We didn't give them advance word about the operation 
itself, but we expressed our concern about the way things were developing." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials have refused to discuss their contacts with their American 
counterparts before the American intervention into Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P. Perfiliev, speaking at a news conference 
this week, declined to confirm or deny if there had been any contacts between 
American and Soviet officials before the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not authorized to comment on this matter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The official media has reported that Gen. Manuel A. Noriega is targeted by the 
United States because of his nationalist views and has described the drug 
charges leveled against him as unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
But in private meetings with American officials, "the Soviets said they 
recognized Noriega was not a wonderful character," one U.S. source in the 
Soviet capital said. "They didn't say they thought it was right for us to send 
in troops, but their criticism in private was more mild than it was in public." 
</P>
<P>
While the Soviet Union does not share close relations with Panama and neither 
country has an embassy in the other's capital, Moscow's Communist ally Cuban 
President Fidel Castro is a staunch supporter of Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"In the light of the Cuban position, Moscow could clearly not stand by and say 
nothing about Panama," one Western diplomatic analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
But, regarding the long-term effect on Soviet-American relations, the analyst 
said: "I see absolutely nothing that would suggest to me that they wish to 
carry this into other areas -- quite to the contrary, all other appointments 
are going on normally." 
</P>
<P>
And a longtime Soviet analyst agreed. "It is, without doubt, an irritant in the 
public arena," he said. "But it will not affect the course of Soviet-American 
relations."

POLITICAL CHANGES ABROAD CREATING HEAVY DEMANDS FOR U.S. AID;

<P>
BUDGET: OFFICIALS SEE APPEALS FROM PANAMA AND EASTERN EUROPE COMPETING WITH 
OTHER DEFICIT BURDENS.

<P>
Just as a domestic budget squeeze tightens in the United States, the sudden 
political changes in Panama and Eastern Europe are unleashing appeals for 
sharply increased U.S. foreign aid -- appeals that the United States may not be 
able to satisfy. 
</P>
<P>
"The democratization of Eastern Europe is welcome politically, of course, but 
it's a very disastrous situation from a budgetary viewpoint," said a key 
Administration strategist who has been keeping tabs on the problem. "There's a 
serious question of how you manage it all." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dave McCurdy (D-Okla.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, 
said Congress will be more willing to vote aid to Panama, now that U.S. forces 
have deposed Manuel A. Noriega as that country's dictator. 
</P>
<P>
But, McCurdy fretted, "put this on top of aid to Poland and Hungary and the 
Philippines and El Salvador and environmental restoration and drug interdiction 
and the savings and loan associations, and that is a heck of a burden." 
</P>
<P>
Although the amounts proposed for individual countries are relatively small, 
the overall increase -- which easily could amount to between $1 billion and $2 
billion a year -- will intensify frictions between the White House and 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
The increased demand comes as the White House is preparing to submit to 
Congress its fiscal 1991 budget, which it has already squeezed substantially to 
reach the target specified by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, a growing number of lawmakers are beginning to question whether 
President Bush will be able to keep his campaign promise to avoid a tax boost. 
"I wonder if he is going be able to get away with saying 'Read my lips' much 
longer," McCurdy said. 
</P>
<P>
In broad policy terms, there is little doubt that the United States can afford 
the extra money. Even a $2-billion increase is not very much in a $1.2-trillion 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Charles L. Schultze, a Brookings Institution economist, noted that U.S. 
spending for the Marshall Plan, which helped restore European economies during 
the four years just after World War II, amounted to 4.7% of this country's 
total output -- the equivalent of $240 billion today, or $60 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Alan J. Stoga, economic analyst for Kissinger Associates of New York, 
pointed out that, while the United States footed the Marshall Plan bill alone, 
today's aid to Eastern Europe is being financed "primarily by the Germans, the 
French, the Italians and the British." 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is contributing only a small part," he asserted. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, some analysts here are expecting Washington to reap a massive 
"peace dividend" from sharply reduced defense spending as tensions between the 
West and East subside. The newly available money could far outstrip any extra 
costs from increased aid. 
</P>
<P>
But critics pointed out that the "peace dividend," while always possible in 
theory, has traditionally proved elusive in practice. And even if the savings 
materialize, they probably will come too late to ease the budget squeeze for a 
year or two. 
</P>
<P>
The coming year's budget fight is expected to be fierce enough, even without 
the extra strain caused by demands for more foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee 
that handles foreign aid issues, already has pledged to hold the foreign aid 
budget hostage unless the Administration relents on proposed domestic spending 
cuts. House strategists said that they expect Obey to maintain his earlier 
stance, even with aid to Eastern Europe and Panama at stake. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said that with events now moving rapidly, the White 
House has not had sufficient time to draft its own counterstrategy. Planners 
conceded they are not even sure how much the total tab will be. 
</P>
<P>
Aid that Congress already has approved for Poland and Hungary alone will cost 
nearly $1 billion in the next three years, about double what the Administration 
had budgeted. Estimates for the likely aid needed by Panama range between $200 
million and $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the East European package is likely to be small, but experts said 
the United States could end up having to provide some added aid to Mexico or 
other Latin American debtors if the situations there worsen. The Middle East, 
too, could flare up next year. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, foreign policy experts argued that the outlays will be necessary, 
both to ensure success in the world's fledgling democracies and to maintain 
U.S. leadership in global affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has cut foreign aid spending sharply in recent years as lawmakers 
scrambled to save domestic programs from the budget ax. State Department 
planners said that many smaller countries where the United States could make 
some gains have been cut out entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker, traditionally a 
hard-liner in urging Congress to hold spending down, has argued that spending 
to maintain American leadership is worth even the price of higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"The costs are within our capacity," Volcker argued in a column in the 
Washington Post last weekend. "It is the costs of withdrawal from leadership 
that are truly incalculable." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Z. Lawrence, a Brookings Institution economist, agreed. "This only 
indicates how niggardly our situation is because we aren't able to fulfill our 
foreign needs," he said. "I don't see that any one of these things is 
potentially large enough to break the bank." 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all sides agree that the increased demands posed by the global 
movement toward democracy are likely to make the budget process more difficult, 
no matter what the outcome. Stoga, of Kissinger Associates, said the most 
glaring problem for the moment is that no one in Washington seems to have a 
strategy to cover the need. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me what ought to be happening -- but isn't -- is that we need to 
sit back and say: 'Hey there's something going on here, and we ought to plan 
for it,' " Stoga said. "The risk is that we could do it piecemeal, which is the 
way we are doing it."

PANAMA REOPENS WASHINGTON EMBASSY

Panama's new government reopened its embassy to the United States on Friday as 
Carlos Rodriguez, who had been an exile living in Miami, received the silver 
keys to the building from the previous ambassador, Juan Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, named ambassador by Panamanian President Guillermo Endara, entered 
the embassy after meeting with President Bush and assuring him that his 
countrymen feel "liberated" by the U.S. invasion of Panama and the overthrow of 
dictator Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
He said that he and Bush discussed "removing the (U.S) troops as soon as it 
becomes practical to do so." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, a city councilman in Panama City in the 1960s and a candidate for 
vice president in 1984, said he has long worked in opposition to Noriega and 
now hopes to work closely with the United States to "restore tranquillity to 
the people of Panama." 
</P>
<P>
Appearing to be nervous -- his voice shaking at times before television cameras 
at the elegant, oak-floored embassy -- Rodriguez grinned when asked to respond 
to critics who say that the United States appears to be fashioning a government 
on behalf of the Panamanian people. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people who make that type of statement fail to understand that 
Panamanians elected Mr. Endara by a margin of 3 to 1 . . . ," he said. As for 
his own appointment, Rodriguez said: "President Endara came to me. The United 
States had nothing to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said he and Endara have worked closely together for several months 
and share the same vision for a democratic Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez fills a post that had been empty since Sept. 1, when Ambassador Juan 
Sosa, himself a Noriega critic, stepped down. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing with Rodriguez was Lawrence Chewning, named by Endara to be Panama's 
ambassador to the Organization of American States. But Chewning faced a problem 
that Rodriguez did not: The present holder of his office has refused to vacate, 
and Chewning had to move into a separate office.

DRUG MONEY: PANAMA STRONGMAN MAY HAVE FUNDS HIDDEN AROUND WORLD. AND IT MAY 
INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN U.S. REAL ESTATE.

<P>
U.S. forces in Panama have found personal records of deposed strongman Manuel 
A. Noriega that could help investigators find millions of dollars in illicit 
drug profits that he has stashed around the world, including possible 
investments in U.S. real estate, Justice Department officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department has joined the effort by appealing to foreign 
governments under terms of U.S. treaty agreements to freeze any identifiable 
assets of Noriega's, the officials said. The treaties mandate such cooperation, 
even in nations with bank secrecy laws, if there is evidence that hidden funds 
resulted from criminal activities. 
</P>
<P>
David Runkel, a special assistant to Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, said U.S. 
military authorities "have seized a sizable amount of records" belonging to 
Noriega in connection with their assault on the headquarters of the Panamanian 
Defense Forces, which he commanded. 
</P>
<P>
Although the headquarters building was leveled in the initial nighttime attack 
by U.S. forces early Wednesday, the records were seized from an office used by 
Noriega within the PDF compound that apparently was still intact, Runkel said. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega is under indictment in the United States on charges that he accepted 
millions of dollars in bribes to help members of Colombia's Medellin cartel 
launder drug profits in his nation and ship cocaine to ports in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Runkel said documents obtained from Noriega's office also "might suggest that 
he looted from the public treasury." He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
The seized records, if they prove relevant, will be made available to federal 
prosecutors if Noriega is captured and brought to the United States to face 
drug-smuggling charges on which he and others were indicted in February, 1988, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A government attorney with experience in drug matters said he doubts Noriega 
would prevail in a U.S. court by arguing that the evidence against him was 
illegally seized in a military attack on his country. 
</P>
<P>
"Fourth Amendment protections against illegal search and seizure stop at the 
water's edge," the attorney said. "They generally do not apply outside the 
United States, especially when the defendant -- like Noriega -- is a foreign 
citizen." 
</P>
<P>
However, any future trial of Noriega could be complicated by the fact that he 
once served as a key informant for the CIA, the Drug Enforcement Agency and 
perhaps other intelligence agencies, according to the government lawyer and 
other sources. 
</P>
<P>
They said that Noriega could be expected to argue that his drug trafficking was 
condoned by U.S. intelligence agents in return for information on subjects of 
interest to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department, according to one official, was so concerned about 
Noriega's intelligence connections that a special meeting was called late last 
week by Mark M. Richards, a high official of the department's criminal 
division. Those attending included representatives of the FBI, DEA and Customs 
Service, as well as the U.S. attorneys from Miami and Tampa, Fla., where the 
indictments against him were returned. 
</P>
<P>
Richards concluded, however, that there is "sufficient evidence to make this a 
winnable case," an official said. 
</P>
<P>
If Noriega sought to compel production of embarrassing records showing his past 
ties to the U.S. intelligence community, a federal judge would be required to 
examine such records in private before deciding if they were relevant to the 
charges against the dictator. 
</P>
<P>
"They might well be judged to be irrelevant and Noriega would get nowhere," one 
attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Miami attorney Neal R. Sonnett, one of Noriega's lawyers, confirmed that he 
would seek to obtain and introduce such documents. He said that Noriega's past 
connections to the U.S. government "are no secret" and that "some of those 
issues would be relevant to our defense." 
</P>
<P>
If a judge ruled in Noriega's favor and if Thornburgh determined that such 
material was too sensitive to produce at trial, the attorney general would have 
to risk dismissal of the case. That situation occurred for the first time last 
month in the Iran-Contra case, when a judge dismissed all charges against 
Joseph F. Fernandez, a former CIA station chief in Costa Rica.

ROMANIA AT A GLANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu, the last hard-line East Bloc Communist 
holdout against reforms, was overthrown Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Western leaders hailed the development, and the 12-nation European Community 
quickly agreed to provide aid and cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
THE NATION: Population: 23.1 million. Area: 91,699 square miles (slightly 
smaller than Oregon.) Capital: Bucharest 
</P>
<P>
ALLIANCES: Although a full member of the Warsaw Pact and Comecon (the Soviet 
Bloc economic grouping), Romania traditionally has been considered a maverick 
by the West. It maintained ties to China. Ceausescu's regime encouraged a more 
relaxed form of socialism than Moscow had approved. Workers, for example, can 
invest and acquire share in factory ownership. But political repression has 
been extensive. 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: Foreign debt was estimated at $2.2 billion in 1988. However, Ceausescu 
claimed to have wiped it out after instituting a harsh austerity program and 
exporting food to obtain hard currency. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu urged better agricultural production to help ease food shortages. 
Shoppers line up in streets of Bucharest for meat, cheese, edible oil and 
flour. There are also shortages of electric power and fuel.

HOW EVENTS UNFOLDED IN ROMANIA

<TEXT>
<P>
These events led to the ouster of Nicolae Ceausescu, Romania's hard-line 
president and Communist Party chief: 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 24 -- Ceausescu is reappointed to another five-year term and rejects the 
democratic reforms being adopted elsewhere in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 15-16 -- Protesters ring a church in the western town of Timisoara where 
authorities want to evict a minister. The minister campaigned for rights of 
ethnic Hungarians, whose villages were being razed by the government. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 17 -- Thousands of people join the crowd at the church, and riots occur 
when authorities try to remove the minister. Police reportedly fire guns and 
water cannon. Some casualties are reported. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 18 -- Dozens of deaths are reported in clashes between police and 
demonstrators in Timisoara. Romania seals its border with Yugoslavia. In spite 
of the violence, Ceausescu travels to Iran for a state visit. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 19 -- Shooting and fires are reported in several cities in western 
Romania. Witnesses say hundreds of protesters may be dead. Soldiers armed with 
automatic weapons patrol Bucharest streets, and troops surround the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 20 -- 10,000 anti-Ceausescu demonstrators reportedly march unhindered 
through Timisoara. The government puts troops on a nationwide alert. Ceausescu 
returns from Iran as scheduled, blaming "fascist, reactionary groups" for the 
unrest. Witnesses and diplomats say up 2,000 demonstrators may have died. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 21 -- Security forces supported by tanks attack anti-Ceausescu 
demonstrations in Bucharest, and 13 people are reported killed in the violence. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 22 -- News agencies report the military joins with demonstrators to 
overthrow the government. Ceausescu and his wife fly from the presidential 
palace by helicopter, and he is later reported to have been arrested.

<P>
A meeting of all of Czechoslovakia's political parties Friday nominated 
opposition leader Vaclav Havel for president and Alexander Dubcek as Parliament 
chairman, the official news agency CTK reported. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, a dissident playwright whose works were banned, emerged as the 
opposition leader during a peaceful revolution that began in mid-November and 
ended four decades of Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
Dubcek was Communist Party chief in 1968 and led the Prague Spring of reform 
that was crushed by a Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion. 
</P>

CTK quoted a statement issued after Friday's meeting as saying: "In agreement 
with the publicly expressed will of the Czechoslovak public, we recognize as a 
respected representative . . . for the office of president Mr. Vaclav Havel and 
for the office of Federal Assembly chairman, Mr. Alexander Dubcek." 
</P>
<P>
The talks also produced an agreement on restructuring Parliament, which is to 
vote Dec. 29 on the two positions, the agency said, but no details were 
available Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the majority of posts in the Cabinet are filled by non-Communists, 
members of the party still dominate Parliament. The Dec. 29 session is to be 
televised live.

BERLIN'S HISTORIC BRANDENBURG GATE REOPENS; 
</P>
<P>
GERMANY: RAIN FAILS TO DAMPEN THE CROWD'S ENTHUSIASM AS THE SYMBOL OF A DIVIDED 
LAND GETS TWO NEW BORDER OPENINGS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Brandenburg Gate, the Cold War symbol of a divided Berlin, a divided 
Germany and a divided Europe, was reopened Friday afternoon amid joyous scenes 
undampened by gray skies, relentless rain and the quickly gathering darkness. 
</P>
<P>
The historic, six-columned Grecian-style monument in the heart of the sprawling 
former capital of the German Empire was overwhelmed by East and West Berliners 
who swarmed around it, reveling in this long-awaited Christmas gift. 
</P>
<P>
The Berlin Wall was breached in two places at either side of the Brandenburg 
Gate, leaving a staunch, thick portion of the wall in place. But the wall 
itself seemed almost superfluous, as young people climbed over it, posing for 
pictures and waving champagne bottles, then jumped down on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
The two new border crossings, which had been prepared by East German engineers 
all night Thursday, were formally opened at 3 p.m. Friday by West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow on the east 
side of the wall. 
</P>
<P>
As Kohl and Modrow walked through the central arch of the 200-year-old gate, 
originally built to separate old Berlin from the fields to the west, Modrow 
declared: "This is where the German Reich went down in flames lit by German war 
criminals. The burning stench of war must never again be smelled here. It must 
be a gate of peace." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, many East Germans in the crowd chanted: "Helmut, Helmut!" 
</P>
<P>
Kohl seemed purposely to avoid sounding the German reunification issue in his 
brief speech when he said: "Let us be patient and prudent in the steps we have 
to take to walk forward into our common future." 
</P>
<P>
But a banner said it for Kohl in English: "Berlin Is One Town -- Germany Is One 
Nation." 
</P>
<P>
West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper told the crowd: "Berlin is still divided but 
the people are no longer separated." 
</P>
<P>
East and West Berlin police officers made no attempt to interfere with 
celebrants atop the wall, nor with others who for the first time began banging 
away at the wall from the east side to chip off pieces. 
</P>
<P>
As the wine corks popped, the British Royal Welch Fusiliers band -- the gate 
stands in the British sector of West Berlin -- played marches, but then broke, 
incongruously, into "Deep in the Heart of Texas." 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by a trumpet player standing with thousands of other revelers on top 
of the wall, the crowd sang everything from "Amazing Grace" to "Such a Day as 
Wonderful as Today," an old Berlin folk favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Fireworks lent the occasion a festive atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The Berlin Wall has been opened at various checkpoints since Nov. 9, but the 
Brandenburg Gate had never served as a border crossing since the wall went up 
in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Before the wall was erected, the gate had been the entryway between the two 
sides of the divided city. Under it passed the Unter Den Linden, once the most 
famous and elegant thoroughfare in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier times, the gate was the center arch for promenades by Prussian 
aristocrats, Nazi parades with Hitler in an open car and, in the end, for 
Soviet tanks marauding through it during the apocalyptic Battle for Berlin in 
1945. 
</P>
<P>
So for many Germans, the Brandenburg Gate's opening Friday has been the 
ultimate test of the East German government's decision to liberalize relations 
between East and West Berlin -- and the two Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
As Franz Bertele, West Germany's chief emissary to East Germany, put it as he 
wandered on the east side: "It's a great feeling to be able to walk under the 
gate after 28 years. We never thought we would live long enough to see this 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"My only problem is that I lost my wife in all the excitement. I'm trying to 
find her." 
</P>
<P>
One couple who were married in East Berlin on Friday decided to come through 
the new Brandenburg opening to have a ceremonial dinner in West Berlin. 
Dietrich and Sybile Schumann, she wearing a white hat and veil and carrying a 
bouquet of flowers, both said "wunderbar" -- wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
"My own parents met at the Brandenburg Gate in 1958," said Sybile. "So walking 
through on my wedding day is lovely -- even though it is raining." 
</P>
<P>
And under the tall columns, three generations of one East Berlin family were 
heading west -- for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Grandfather Willi Szeszrat, son Juergen, and 8-year-old grandson, Mario, walked 
together toward the new opening. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to be part of it all," said Juergen.

PRESIDENT VISITS AIDS PATIENTS IN U.S. CLINIC; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: BUSH URGES COMPASSION FOR VICTIMS OF THE DISEASE. RESEARCHERS ARE 
CALLED HEROES.

<P>
President Bush, striving to keep a normal schedule amid the Panama crisis, met 
with AIDS patients at a National Institutes of Health clinic Friday and 
characterized as "heroes" the biomedical researchers who are easing their 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Bush called for compassion and understanding for AIDS patients, but he warned 
that many Americans still "don't want to help, don't want to become involved, 
because of a misplaced fear." 
</P>
<P>
He said that more education is needed, noting that many Americans are "afraid 
of holding an AIDS patient because they're afraid of getting AIDS. Barbara and 
I want to say -- and we hope we can continue to demonstrate this -- they are 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
AIDS is transmitted primarily through sexual contact and the sharing of 
hypodermic needles by drug addicts. It can also be transmitted through 
contaminated blood products and can be passed by an infected mother to her 
unborn infant. 
</P>
<P>
Bush likened AIDS researchers to the young soldiers fighting in Panama. In both 
cases, individuals are "giving the greatest gift imaginable, the gift of life." 
</P>
<P>
The President cited efforts in clinical pathology, diagnostic radiology, 
nuclear medicine and laboratory science, saying that such research has resulted 
in significant advances. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the reported success of an AIDS-related vaccine in animals and the 
use of the drug AZT to treat AIDS patients are advances that stem from basic 
biomedical research supported by the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
At the national institutes' clinic in Bethesda, Md., Bush met with two groups 
of AIDS patients: one composed of adult victims and one of infected children 
who were accompanied by their parents. 
</P>
<P>
One of the children, 9-year-old Brent Lykins, dressed in a blue suit and pink 
bow tie, told the President: "I hope everyone will be cured." 
</P>
<P>
Bush replied to the small blond child: "I believe it will happen." 
</P>
<P>
He gave the children small boxes of candy. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Bush met at the Bethesda clinic with gay men suffering from AIDS 
was hailed by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force as the first time that 
the Administration had openly acknowledged that AIDS "has a particular impact 
on the gay community and gay people." 
</P>
<P>
"We hope the President will go beyond a photo opportunity to provide genuine 
presidential leadership," said Sue Hyde, a task force spokeswoman. "It's about 
time, eight years into the epidemic. There's not a moment to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Hyde called on Bush to push for approval of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act, which she described as a "civil rights act for people with all sorts of 
disabilities," including AIDS. In addition, she urged Bush to support funding 
for an educational campaign on how to prevent transmission of AIDS and for a 
national health care plan. 
</P>
<P>
As of November, 115,158 AIDS cases had been reported to the federal Centers for 
Disease Control, the White House said. Among them, White House Press Secretary 
Marlin Fitzwater said, were 1,947 children under 13 years old. Of the total 
reported cases, 68,441 individuals, including 1,059 children, have died. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said that, based on current projections, about 1 million people in 
the United States are infected with the HIV virus and that available data 
suggests that, by 1992, the cumulative number of diagnosed AIDS cases will be 
365,000, with nearly 263,000 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the federal government had committed $2.25 billion in the last 
fiscal year to fight AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who toured the national institutes' center shortly before leaving 
Washington for the holidays, has maintained an active schedule this week 
despite the conflict between U.S. troops and supporters of Panamanian strongman 
Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's strategy contrasts pointedly with that of former President Jimmy Carter, 
who canceled many trips and functions during the Iran hostage crisis. Carter, 
perceived by many to be overly preoccupied with the crisis, suffered political 
damage as a result. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the events of the last few days, I know that you have a lot on your 
mind," Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of health and human services, told the 
President. "That is why we are very grateful and extremely honored by your 
visit here today." 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said that Bush's visit to the facility "underlines your unwavering 
national commitment to biomedical research and to the members of our scientific 
community on this campus and around the nation."

JURY RECOMMENDS 16-YEARS FOR DRIVER IN 27-DEATH CRASH 
</P>

<P>
A jury on Friday recommended 16 years in prison for the man who caused the 
nation's worst drunken-driving accident, but families of some of Larry 
Mahoney's 27 victims said it is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
Mahoney, 36, was led in handcuffs out of the Carroll County Courthouse and 
taken to the local jail after Circuit Judge Charles Satterwhite discontinued 
his bail. 
</P>
<P>
Satterwhite is to sentence Mahoney formally in February. The judge may give 
Mahoney a lighter sentence, but he may not exceed the jury's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Mahoney was convicted on 27 counts each of second-degree 
manslaughter and first-degree wanton endangerment, 12 of first-degree assault, 
14 of second-degree wanton endangerment and one of drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
The recommended sentences totaled 611 years, but the jury opted to have them 
run concurrently. That effectively imposed on Mahoney 16 years of a possible 
20-year sentence for assault, the offense that carried the stiffest penalty. He 
would be eligible for parole consideration in eight years under Kentucky law. 
</P>
<P>
The jury determined that Mahoney caused the crash of a church-owned school bus 
on May 14, 1988, as he drove on the wrong side of Interstate 71 when 
intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
The crash five miles south of Carrollton caused a fire that killed 24 children 
and three adults who were returning to the Radcliff First Assembly of God 
Church. Forty people escaped, but 12 children suffered severe burns. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers noted the irony of Mahoney's being sentenced to a longer term for the 
burn injuries, which were covered by the assault charges, than for the deaths. 
The maximum sentence for second-degree manslaughter is 10 years, which the jury 
recommended on each of the 27 counts. But that was made moot by the 
recommendation that the prison terms be concurrent, not consecutive. 
</P>
<P>
The jury's verdict and sentence recommendations were "a big letdown" for the 
victims' families, because the state had charged Mahoney with murder in each of 
the deaths, William Nichols said. His son, William Joseph Nichols Jr., 17, died 
in the bus fire. 
</P>
<P>
"I've forgiven Larry Mahoney, but he's got to pay for his crime, and eight 
years is not enough," Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Atty Gen. Paul Richwalsky, who prosecuted Mahoney, said he was 
disappointed both by the jury's refusal to convict the chemical plant worker of 
murder and by the recommended sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked for consecutive (sentences) but they gave concurrent," Richwalsky 
said. "I thought all the carnage . . . was worth more than eight years." 
</P>
<P>
William Summers, lead attorney on Mahoney's three-man defense team, said that 
he was "basically . . . pleased with the verdict." 
</P>
<P>
"We beat 27 murder counts," Summers said. "At least (Mahoney) can hold his head 
up. He's not a mass murderer." 
</P>
<P>
Mahoney is remorseful regardless of the length of his prison sentence, Summers 
said. "If putting him away for life would take away some of the hurt, he'd do 
it," Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
One of Mahoney's last requests while waiting for the jury's verdict on Thursday 
was to meet with Kentucky State Police Trooper Henry (Sonny) Cease, who was the 
case's lead investigator. 
</P>
<P>
Cease had to remove the victims' bodies the day after the crash, when the bus 
was hauled to a temporary morgue at Carrollton's National Guard Armory. 
</P>
<P>
In their brief meeting, Mahoney "just said he holds no grudges against me," 
Cease said. "I told him I feel the same way he does: I wish we weren't here."

WILSON RETURNS $16,000 IN CAMPAIGN DONATIONS FROM LINCOLN S&amp;L OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Republican Sen. Pete Wilson has returned approximately $16,000 in 
campaign contributions that were given to him in 1985 by Charles H. Keating 
Jr., owner of embattled Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Otto Bos, Wilson's chief spokesman in California, said Friday: "We did not do 
anything for Mr. Keating and if he thought that his contribution would acquire 
such influence, he was badly mistaken. So, even though it was four years later, 
we returned the money this week." 
</P>
<P>
Keating's American Continental Corp., the parent firm of Lincoln S&amp;L, sold 
more than $200 million in uninsured junk bonds, which are now worthless. About 
22,000 people, many of them elderly S&amp;L customers in California, bought the 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Five U.S. senators, including California Democrat Alan Cranston, met with 
federal regulators on Keating's behalf after he contributed money to their 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Bos said that the contributions to Wilson in 1985 came in the form of checks 
"from Keating and his associates" and were intended for the senator's 1988 
reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is now running for governor of California, but Bos said that to his 
knowledge Keating had made no contributions to that campaign.

MARYLAND STATE JUDGE INJURED BY PACKAGE BOMB;

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As authorities ended a frantic week of mail-bomb investigations in the Deep 
South, another device exploded here Friday, injuring a judge, the third attack 
on court officials in seven days. 
</P>
<P>
Washington County Circuit Judge John Printz Corderman, 47, was taken to a 
hospital, suffering from wounds to his groin and fingers after he opened a 
brown paper-wrapped package bomb that was left on the doorstep of his 
third-floor apartment in downtown Hagerstown. 
</P>
<P>
After this latest bombing, warnings were sent by Teletype across Maryland to 
other judges and prosecutors, widening the list of potential mail-bomb targets 
around the country. Already on this list were federal judges and civil rights 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
George Hopgood, a special agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 
said that agents had also found an unexploded bomb at the judge's apartment. He 
refused to say whether it had been in the same package. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb that did go off exploded in the judge's hands, Hopgood said, but it 
was not particularly powerful. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Charles R. Chaney, Corderman's physician, said that "it was a 
life-threatening bomb, but the injuries do not threaten him." Corderman is 
expected to remain in the hospital for three days. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have no suspects in the Corderman attack, Hopgood said. He added 
that "there is no evidence that (the Hagerstown bombs) were connected to the 
others" in the South. 
</P>
<P>
"It does not sound like the same (mode of operation)," Tom Moore, an FBI agent 
in Birmingham, Ala., said. "It sounds like a copy cat." 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, U.S. Circuit Judge Robert S. Vance was killed at his home in 
Mountain Brook, Ala., when a nail bomb, contained in a package delivered 
through the mail, exploded. A similar bomb killed Savannah, Ga., attorney 
Robert Robinson, and other bombs sent to the U.S. 11th Circuit Court building 
here and to the Jacksonville, Fla., NAACP office were safely defused. 
</P>
<P>
The new bomb was less powerful than the other four devices, which were about 
the size of a shoe box, made of explosives-filled pipe surrounded by nails. 
Each bomb was in a package postmarked in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Keyes, a neighbor of Corderman, said that, when he heard the explosion, 
"I thought maybe it was a neighbor who had dropped something on the floor. It 
sounded like a muffled-type bomb. My brother-in-law thought the truck had 
backfired." 
</P>
<P>
Keyes said he had seen a deliveryman bring a package into the building about 20 
minutes before the 2:30 p.m. explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a normal person to me, a normal delivery," Keyes said, adding 
that the deliveryman stayed inside the apartment 5 to 10 minutes. Ten minutes 
after he departed, the bomb exploded, Keyes said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators' theories about the earlier bombings center on race. They believe 
that a white supremacist or group of them may have committed the crimes in 
retaliation for court decisions upholding school integration and judgments 
against the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland, like the Deep South, where the other bombings occurred, is known as a 
hotbed of klan activity, but it is not known whether Judge Corderman had been 
made a target of the group. A computer search did not link him to any 
race-related cases. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about a possible motive in the Corderman case, police Lt. Robert 
Frick said: "He's a judge. He's put a lot of people away." 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1986, an angry burglary defendant, sentenced to four years, threw a 
chair at the judge. Corderman promptly added six years to the sentence, vowing 
to file assault charges, and said that the man "has demonstrated he doesn't 
want to be rehabilitated." 
</P>
<P>
Just last Monday, the judge presided over a case in which a 28-year-old man 
pleaded guilty to beating a 90-year-old woman to death. The man, returned to 
jail to await sentencing, could get a life term. 
</P>
<P>
Corderman, a Hagerstown native, has sat on Maryland's 4th Circuit bench since 
1977. He served as a state senator from 1975 to 1977 and was a deputy state's 
attorney from 1971 to 1974. The Maryland State's Attorneys' Assn. named him 
Legislator of the Year in 1976. He served as president of the Maryland State 
Bar Assn. in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his distinguished career, Corderman has not escaped controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative Washington Legal Foundation filed a complaint against 
Corderman in 1987 because of his support of Handgun Control Inc., a 
Washington-based lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Paul Kamenar, a foundation representative, said that the group 
filed the complaint because Corderman violated the code of judicial conduct in 
a "crusade to ban handguns." Kamenar said he thought the judge had resigned 
from Handgun Control, and "that sort of took care of" the complaint. "Nothing 
further was done. That satisfied our concerns." 
</P>
<P>
No one from Handgun Control could be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hagerstown Police Chief Paul Wood said Friday that "I understand the judge held 
a permit to carry a weapon." 
</P>
<P>
In a controversial gambling case that went to the U.S. Supreme in 1986, 
Corderman was overruled in a decision that he had made in favor of bar and 
tavern owners. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Corderman had ruled unconstitutional a state law forbidding gambling 
in bars. However, the Maryland Court of Appeals upheld the law, and the Supreme 
Court refused to hear the case, allowing the law to stand. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Friday that they have no suspects in any of the bombings and 
attempted bombings. They have called in FBI behavioral psychologist William 
Hagmaier, who worked on the California "Night Stalker" case, in which Richard 
Ramirez was convicted of a series of murders. Hagmaier, who has been working in 
Birmingham, had also conducted extensive interviews with mass murderer Theodore 
Bundy. 
</P>
<P>
Hagmaier, who has been trying to develop a psychological profile of the bomb 
murderer, has provided investigators with "significant help," FBI agent Moore

POLICE SEEK GUNMAN IN SANTA SUIT WHO KILLED 1 MAN, WOUNDED 1

Bakersfield police continued to search Friday for a gunman wearing a Santa 
Claus suit who, for no apparent reason, shot one man to death and wounded 
another in the parking lot of a coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Obney, 36, of Joshua Tree died of multiple gunshots and a companion 
suffered an arm wound in the attack Thursday evening outside a Denny's 
restaurant, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded man, who was reported in fair condition at a local hospital, was 
not identified. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were walking toward their pickup truck after making a phone call to 
arrange the sale of German shepherd puppies that were in the vehicle when the 
assailant in the Santa outfit suddenly appeared, pulled a rifle from a 
gift-wrapped package and opened fire, police said. 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, the assailant quickly disappeared into heavy fog that had 
fallen over the area, police said. 
</P>
<P>
A witness said authorities took two puppies from a camper shell on the pickup 
and took them to an animal shelter.

GOP AGREES TO SETTLE POLL GUARD SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Republican Assemblyman Curt Pringle, the Orange County Republican Party and 
others who infuriated Latinos and Democrats by posting uniformed guards at 
polling places last year agreed Friday to pay $400,000 to settle a civil rights 
lawsuit against them. 
</P>
<P>
But lawyers for the six Latino voters who filed the federal lawsuit said they 
have not signed the proposed settlement. Joseph Remcho, the lead attorney for 
the plaintiffs, denied the case had been settled but said he expected a 
settlement early next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We are under terms of a court order forbidding us from discussing a settlement 
until it's final and signed by all parties," Remcho said. "I'm a lawyer, not a 
politician, and I'll abide by the order." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit had been scheduled for trial Jan. 16 in U.S. District Court in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Pringle (R-Garden Grove), local Republican officials and Assemblyman John R. 
Lewis (R-Orange), who was also a defendant in the case, could not be reached 
for comment. Michael G. Balmages, chairman of the Orange County Democratic 
Party, hailed the settlement but said he was sorry the case was not going to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
"The plaintiffs will not get their day in court and the public will be deprived 
(of learning more) about the illegal, unconstitutional and highly unethical 
acts that were committed by the Orange County Republican Party and the campaign 
of Mr. Pringle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal agencies are still investigating to determine whether any 
criminal charges should be filed over the decision to post the guards at 20 
polling places in predominantly Latino areas of Santa Ana on Nov. 8, 1988, when 
Pringle narrowly defeated Democrat Christian (Rick) Thierbach to take the 72nd 
Assembly District seat. 
</P>
<P>
The guards carried signs in English and Spanish warning that non-citizens 
cannot legally vote. Some Latino leaders complained that it was a clear attempt 
to scare them away from polling places. County Republican officials responded 
that the guards were there only to monitor and report election fraud. They said 
a rumor had spread that Democrats planned to bus in illegal voters to tip the 
contest in Thierbach's favor. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs had asked that the election results be set aside, but if a final 
settlement is reached, the outcome will stand. 
</P>
<P>
None of the defendants admitted any wrongdoing by agreeing to settle the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs in the case were Rumaldo Madrid, Rudy R. Rios, Jose Diaz Vargas, 
Helen R. Canales, Tommy Q. Canales and Jane Fantauzzi, all of Santa Ana.

CONFLICTS: PEACE ON EARTH IS ELUSIVE FOR MANY IN PANAMA, ROMANIA, EL SALVADOR 
AND THE PHILIPPINES, AND FRIENDS IN THE SOUTHLAND SHARE THEIR ANXIETY.

<P>
As the final Christmas of the 1980s draws near, Arturo Hassan waits every hour 
for telephone facsimiles out of Panama City -- frightening, sometimes 
contradictory reports that starkly dispel the notion of peace on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The faxes are provided to him by a source he feels compelled to keep secret. 
They reach him several times a day at his office in Pasadena, detailing every 
turn in the bloody assault by U.S. troops on fugitive Panamanian dictator 
Manuel A. Noriega and his forces. Although Hassan, 55, left Latin America 
nearly 20 years ago, he reads with fear. 
</P>
<P>
His brother is down there. So are his six sisters and their families -- more 
nephews, nieces and relatives than he can count. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going through a hell of an ordeal," he said Friday. "My concern is about 
the roving paramilitary people down there that Noriega gave the weapons to. 
These are ex-convicts; these are men that Noriega let out of the jail. That's 
where the danger comes in -- the snipers and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
"You cannot talk on the telephone because they're all bugged. . . . I haven't 
slept but about seven hours in the last three days. It's very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Like many of the tens of thousands of immigrants now living in the Los Angeles 
area, Hassan has found it is not a season to be jolly. In fact, global events 
are overshadowing the holiday season for ethnic groups in all quarters of the 
city. Lithuanians talk of sovereignty from the Soviet Union. Filipinos send 
packages of food and clothing back to the homeland, jittery over the prospects 
of another attempted coup. Salvadorans look to the television for reports of 
new guerrilla attacks. 
</P>
<P>
At a storefront printing shop in Bell, Romanian immigrant Nick Moroaica sat 
with his wife, Dana, in front of a flickering black-and-white television, 
eagerly following the overthrow of hard-line Communist dictator Nicolae 
Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
Periodically, the telephone rang as another member of Southern California's 
Romanian community -- estimated at 25,000 -- called to say a new TV report was 
on the air. Moroaica would change the channel, pointing at significant moments 
shown on the tiny screen. 
</P>
<P>
"You see, in the middle of the Romanian flag there's a Communist symbol," he 
said as one march was under way. "Now people are waving Romanian flags with 
holes in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
For Moroaica it had been a particularly taxing week. He had talked Sunday night 
with an uncle in the city of Timisoara shortly after pro-democracy 
demonstrators began clashing with government security forces. 
</P>
<P>
His uncle was so fearful of being overheard that he said almost nothing, except 
that "something is going on here," Moroaica said. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Moroaica lost contact for four days, a time in which the reported 
death toll grew from a few dozen to a few hundred to 4,000 or more. On 
Thursday, Moroaica made more than 100 calls in six hours, he said, desperately 
trying to get through on jammed telephone lines. At last, he reached his uncle 
and learned that freedom had come -- at least in Timisoara. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just yelling on the telephone, jubilating," Moroaica recalled. "He 
said, 'Do you understand it, we are free! We are free!' " 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Romanians were planning a massive demonstration -- the third in two 
days -- this morning at Los Angeles City Hall, where a blood drive was to 
begin. Pastor Liviu Olah of the Romanian Baptist Church in Bellflower was 
dividing time Friday between preparations for the rally and his duties at the 
church, which include planning a Sunday Christmas festival. He had not yet 
heard from relatives in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
"The security police there destroyed all the bottles of blood; they are 
completely out of blood in the hospitals in Romania," he said. "We slept last 
night about three hours. Our phone's been ringing all the time." 
</P>
<P>
At La Placita Church, a Salvadoran refugee center in downtown Los Angeles, 
Father Luis Olivares also was dealing with communication difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"Contact by telephone (with El Salvador) is almost impossible," he said, 
"although we have been able to send fax transmittals two or three times daily. 
The information we get by fax is general -- a chronology of the day's events or 
the damage reports of certain areas. We try to convey specific inquiries when 
we get them." 
</P>
<P>
Olivares said it is difficult to tell how many of the church's transmissions 
get through. "Church workers, like most of the people (in El Salvador), are 
forced to move around for their security. Areas get bombed out. We never know 
where our contacts are going to be." 
</P>
<P>
Church volunteer Jose Casco, 38, learned in one recent report that his brother 
had been killed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm thinking what Christmas must be like for my parents and my brothers and 
sisters in El Salvador," he said. "How am I to enjoy the holidays while they 
suffer there?" 
</P>
<P>
For many without fax machines, the fate of loved ones was a tormenting mystery. 
</P>
<P>
Julio Morales Carasquilla, 25, his wife, Gladys, and three small children are 
living in an apartment in Van Nuys after fleeing the Panama Canal Zone on a 
U.S. military plane. The Carasquillas have many relatives who live in the urban 
neighborhoods hardest hit by the fighting of recent days. They do not know if 
they are alive or dead. 
</P>
<P>
"They are in the middle of the shooting," Julio Carasquilla said. "I feel bad, 
because this is going to be a very ugly Christmas for them." 
</P>
<P>
Just down the hall, Armando Ayarza, 36, and Alberto Vazquez, 30, watch the 
Spanish-language news on a small black-and-white television, shocked by the 
bombardment and heavy gunfire in residential areas such as the San Miguelito 
neighborhood. Vazquez has talked to his parents in the city of Colon and they 
told him they were frightened, but in good condition. Ayarza was less 
fortunate; he spoke for a moment to his mother in Panama City but the line went 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
At the Filipino-American Service Group Inc. in downtown Los Angeles, hefty 
Balikbayan boxes -- the cardboard containers that Filipinos traditionally send 
to the homeland during the holiday season -- were stacked up in unusually large 
numbers, said executive director Connie Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens are sent out twice a month, she said. One family has sent 36 boxes, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Arcadia, a Christmas party of about 20 Filipino expatriates turned into a 
two-hour political briefing with the arrival of a surprise guest: the top aide 
to the president of the Philippine Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The aide, Rafael Fernando, gave eager guests his insights into the attempted 
coup earlier this month that left at least 113 people dead and about 600 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
"It has definitely tempered the celebration," said Ramon Alcaraz, 74, who 
invited Fernando to the party. "And I think it has tempered the attitudes of 
many people here and at home."

BRINK'S GUARD KILLS HOLDUP MAN; 2ND FLEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
A Brink's armored car guard shot and killed a holdup man in a shoot-out inside 
an electronics store in Koreatown late Friday afternoon, but a second suspect 
grabbed a money bag and fled into a street bustling with holiday shoppers, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known how much money was in the bag, picked up at ITC 
Electronics Supermarket, according to police, but the escaping holdup man may 
have also paid a price for the robbery. Blood was found on the sidewalk outside 
the store. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran with the bag down Olympic Boulevard," said Lt. Bob Ruchhoft. "We 
believe he was shot." 
</P>
<P>
The guard, whose identity was not released, was also wounded in the holdup. He 
was later reported in good condition at Good Samaritan Hospital with a leg 
wound. 
</P>
<P>
Police also declined to release the identity of a second guard, who stayed at 
the wheel of the armored truck. Officials said he was following Brink's policy 
by remaining in the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ruchhoft, the Brink's guard made the cash pickup and was 
descending from a second-floor office when the two robbers met him, at least 
one pointing a .44-caliber revolver that police recovered at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing gunfire, Ruchhoft said one of the holdup men was hit at least 
once in the chest and was pronounced dead at the scene. Police have not 
released his identity. 
</P>
<P>
The other man grabbed the bag containing cash and credit card receipts and 
fled, Ruchhoft said. 
</P>
<P>
An employee who asked not to be identified said that as the second robber ran 
past him near the front of the store, "He had a smile on his face." He was 
described as about 25 to 30 years old, of average height and wearing a brown 
suede jacket. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded guard limped outside to the armored car. Police said it was not 
clear whether the robbers wounded the guard or he may have accidentally shot 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Ruchhoft said that Friday's holdup -- which occurred about half an hour before 
the store's 6 p.m. closing -- did not appear to be linked to recent armored car 
robberies in the Los Angeles area. There have been six holdups of armored cars 
in Los Angeles this year, he said, compared with a dozen last year.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEVER READ BUCHWALD STORY, MURPHY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comedian Eddie Murphy, in a sworn deposition released Friday, said he never 
read a story sold to Paramount Pictures by humorist Art Buchwald, but was 
familiar with the idea and liked it. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Murphy says in the deposition that he and talk-show host Arsenio Hall 
wrote the concept for the hit movie "Coming to America," countering Buchwald's 
claims that the movie was based on his story treatment, "King for a Day." 
</P>
<P>
"Coming to America" is about an African prince, played by Murphy, who comes to 
New York to find a bride. Buchwald's story concept focused on a contemptuous 
king from an oil-rich African nation who is stranded in Washington when he is 
overthrown. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Superior Court trial in the $5-million breach-of-contract case 
began last week, focusing on Buchwald's allegation that Paramount stole his 
idea to make "Coming to America," which was the third-biggest hit of 1988, 
grossing $300 million. Murphy has said he will not testify in the case. His 
deposition was taken Oct. 12 by Buchwald's lawyer, Pierce O'Donnell.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANOTHER FERTILE FRUIT FLY FOUND IN EAST 
L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another fertile Mediterranean fruit fly has been found, this one in East Los 
Angeles, but no additional pesticide sprayings are planned. 
</P>
<P>
Don Henry, a spokesman for the Medfly eradication program, said the male fly 
was found Wednesday on Mednik Avenue, and was the first find in five days. 
Although the fly was outside the previous infestation area, Henry said the 
discovery did not arouse as much concern as others have because it was not that 
far from a previous discovery in South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
An aerial pesticide spraying has been planned for the area on Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, 277 square miles of urban territory are being treated with malathion 
to combat the worst Medfly infestation in Southern California history.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY PANEL MOVES TO SETTLE EMBEZZLEMENT 
SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that is expected to settle a lawsuit against an accountant who 
pleaded no contest to embezzling more than $530,000 in county Fire Department 
funds, the Los Angeles County Claims Board Friday recommended accepting his 
wife's portion of their property. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Board of Supervisors proposed the settlement of its lawsuit 
against William Paternostro, 41, who was suspected of taking more than $800,000 
from a department account he controlled. Under the terms of the agreement, 
Paternostro will hand over his 4,462-square-foot Mt. Washington home, valued at 
more than $600,000, and other assets he allegedly accumulated while embezzling 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
Because the suit was also filed against the accountant's estranged wife, 
Margaret, she offered to deed her portion of their home and other shared 
property to settle the matter, claims officials said.

The unarmed man who was shot and killed by Alhambra police Thursday after he 
bolted from his car during a traffic stop has been identified as a 33-year-old 
transient. But authorities declined to release his name until the man's 
relatives have been notified. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they stopped the man about 4 a.m. when they noticed his car 
traveling slowly on Valley Boulevard with the headlights out. After officers 
questioned him about who owned the vehicle, the man sprinted from the car, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers ran after him and were searching the area around an apartment building 
when the man lunged from a dark stairway, police said. He was shot once in the 
chest.

SANTA AND SUNSHINE EXPECTED IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's going to be a blue Christmas in Los Angeles. Blue skies, that is. 
</P>
<P>
While gloomy, gray skies and freezing temperatures plague most of the nation, 
the three-day holiday weekend in Los Angeles will feature sunshine and warmer 
than normal high temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not expecting a whole lot of changes through the holiday weekend," said 
Dan Bowman, a meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for 
The Times. "The high-pressure system, which has been the same here for weeks, 
isn't showing any signs of budging." 
</P>
<P>
Bowman said that high temperatures over the holiday weekend in the Southland 
will range from the upper 60s along the coast to the 70s inland. Overnight lows 
will range from the upper 30s inland to the upper 40s along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Gusty winds may blow below canyons and passes, but should reach no more than 10 
to 20 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the high temperature at the Civic Center was 74 degrees, seven 
degrees higher than average. The overnight low was 49 degrees, one degree above 
average. 
</P>
<P>
The Rocky Mountains, Bowman said, have saved the West Coast from the Arctic 
front that has been delivering record cold temperatures to the Eastern 
two-thirds of the nation. Just east of the Rockies in Colorado, temperatures 
were hovering at around 0 degrees Friday afternoon. West of the Rockies in 
Utah, temperatures were 40 degrees warmer. 
</P>

The warmest temperatures in the nation Friday were in Southern California, with 
the thermometer hitting 80 in Montebello and 81 in Escondido and Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
That trend should continue until well after Santa has dropped off his presents. 
The only thing missing for Christmas in the Southland will be -- as usual -- 
snow.

<P>
"It's going to be a real nice weekend," Bowman said.

MURDERED WOMAN CALLED A 'MARTYR' 
</P>

Grieving relatives and friends of Irene Franco, the 20-year-old woman who was 
brutally raped and murdered after being kidnaped from a Carson drive-in last 
week, cried out for the arrests of her killers Friday at church services in 
which she was called an "innocent martyr." 
</P>
<P>
"I want justice," sobbed Luisa Franco, an aunt of the slain woman who came from 
the Mexican town of Tepatitlan, near Guadalajara. "I want justice." 
</P>
<P>
Irma Plascencia, Irene Franco's closest friend, who shared an apartment with 
her in Wilmington, added, "I hope the conscience of the men who did this will 
force them to face up to what happened." 
</P>
<P>
These were the sentiments repeatedly voiced among 150 mourners who attended a 
funeral mass at Holy Family Roman Catholic Church in Wilmington for the perky 
woman who came to Los Angeles ten months ago, hoping to further her dreams of 
studying medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"Why is she dead?" a middle-aged woman asked in Spanish of anyone who would 
listen. "Why? 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's homicide detectives Friday reported no new leads into the hunt for 
the three men who abducted Franco and her date, Jesus Martinez, 26, at the 
South Bay Six drive-in last Friday night. "We're still working on it," a 
sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Three armed men took the couple from the movie complex near the Harbor and San 
Diego freeways and drove them to an alley in an industrial area near of Carson. 
There, the three severely beat Martinez and tied him with an electrical cord. 
Before the assailants drove away with Franco, they told Martinez not to worry 
about her safety. 
</P>
<P>
The following morning, the woman's body was found in a South Los Angeles field. 
She had been severely beaten and then shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
The mourners, mostly from Mexico, tried to grapple with the senseless murder. 
The words spoken about the area's rising violence came in spurts with the tears 
and abrazos (hugs). 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, sporting a visible scalp wound and a black eye, broke down in tears 
when his girlfriend's casket was opened at the end of the mass. He then left 
without speaking to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Father Luis Vilbuena told the mourners that they needed to band together to 
prevent similar tragedies in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"We can do nothing about what's going on Panama, El Salvador and Nicaragua," 
the priest said, "but there's something we can do here. Irene was an innocent 
martyr. What is her death telling us? We have to ask ourselves what's going on 
in our society. 
</P>
<P>
"I pray these men throw their drugs and guns into the ocean and go back and 
make this a better world." 
</P>
<P>
An anonymous donor paid for most of the funeral expenses, including the 
shipment of the woman's body back to Mexico, Vilbuena said. Officials of the 
Simpson-McGee Mortuary in Lynwood, who handled the arrangements, donated their 
services, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Plascencia, Franco's close friend, said she would accompany the body back to 
Tepatitlan, where interment was scheduled today . 
</P>
<P>
"I made her a promise that we would spend the holidays together," she said. 
"I'm not going to leave her now."

THEY'RE WINNING AN UPHILL BATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
SKIING: PHIL AND STEVE MAHRE WERE ENJOYING RETIREMENT AFTER THEIR OLYMPIC 
SUCCESSES IN 1984. NOW THEY'RE BACK BATTLING SLOPES ON THE PRO CIRCUIT.

<P>
Phil Mahre won gold and silver medals in the Winter Olympics. He was the World 
Cup champion for three consecutive years. He's now 32. 
</P>
<P>
So what is America's greatest skier doing, still out there racing against a 
bunch of Swedes and Austrians and others on the U.S. Pro Tour, most of whom 
wouldn't have been allowed on the same hill with him at Lake Placid or 
Sarajevo? 
</P>
<P>
After all, his archrival back in the early 1980s, Ingemar Stenmark, has retired 
to his villa in Monaco. A ski racing champion is supposed to be set for life. 
At least, that's what Bill Johnson thought when he was asked in 1984 what 
winning the downhill gold medal meant to him. "Millions," he shouted. 
</P>
<P>
But as Johnson has since learned, that's only in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he was the first American male to win Olympic gold in Alpine 
skiing, beating Mahre for that honor by just a couple of days, Johnson did not 
come close to making the Fortune 500. He did acquire a fancy sports car and a 
house in Malibu, briefly, but that's another story. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Mahre and his twin brother, Steve, came home from the '84 Games to diapers 
that needed changing and families that needed supporting. They went out on top, 
then set themselves up in business. But, as with Johnson, the millions just 
weren't there -- not that they really had expected them to be. 
</P>
<P>
During the next four years, the Mahres started a line of ski clothing and 
established their own training centers for recreational skiers, while 
continuing longtime associations with various companies in the ski industry. 
They did just about everything except race. 
</P>
<P>
There was talk in 1986 of their making a comeback with the U.S. ski team, but 
nothing developed. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened," Phil said the other day, "was that they approached us in the 
spring of '86 and asked if we would be interested in rejoining the team for two 
years, through the 1988 Winter Olympics at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
"We told them what we'd need, what the figures had to be, for us to return. The 
ball was in their court, but we never heard anything back. There were so many 
questions to be answered: Would we have to give up the clothing line? The 
training centers? And so on. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think we could have won some races again." 
</P>
<P>
The clothing line is no more, and although the training-center programs have 
been successful, the Mahres clearly figured they could use the renewed exposure 
-- as well as the money -- when they decided to come out of retirement and join 
the pro circuit last winter. 
</P>
<P>
Phil almost won the championship as a rookie, finishing a close second to 
Sweden's Jorgen Sundqvist, five years his junior, and earning more than $82,000 
in prize money. Steve, hampered by injuries, finished 15th and made about 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
They both picked up additional bonus checks from various sponsors but more 
important, they were back in the limelight and winning again. 
</P>
<P>
Can they keep it up? 
</P>
<P>
Well, after three stops on this season's tour, Phil leads the standings with 
earnings of $12,250, and Steve is tied for 10th place. At Waterville Valley, 
N.H., on Dec. 10, the twins were finalists in the slalom and raced head to head 
for a purse of $5,000, with the runner-up getting $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Steve took the first run by 0.057 of a second, but Phil finished 0.151 ahead in 
the second run and won the race, despite an aching back. 
</P>
<P>
"My back hurt so bad after the first round, I could barely stand up," Phil 
said. "I had a back problem once when I was an amateur. I took a few days off 
and it went away. I think this will take the same route." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently it did. Phil won again in a slalom the following Sunday at Nashoba 
Valley, Mass., and can now rest for a couple of weeks. He'll spend the holidays 
with his second wife, Holly, and their three children at home in Yakima, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Phil still lives in the house he built himself, a house that former U.S. Coach 
Bob Beattie once described this way: "It's kind of like Phil . . . kind of 
square." 
</P>
<P>
Holly used to travel with Phil, but not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"Two of the kids are in school now, so she has to stay home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When the tour resumes at Heavenly Valley on the first weekend in January, Phil 
will be at Keystone, Colo., running a session of the Mahre Training Center, 
while Steve races. They reversed roles earlier this month at Alpine Meadows. 
"This is the only other conflict," Phil said. "We'll both make the rest of the 
circuit." 
</P>
<P>
There are 13 more stops after Heavenly, including Snow Summit, near Big Bear 
Lake, Jan. 26-28. Three of the events, in March and early April, make up the 
Million Dollar Plymouth Super Series, which is largely responsible for boosting 
this season's purse total to a record level in excess of $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
There has been conjecture that the new riches to be found as a pro racer might 
even be enough to lure Stenmark out of retirement, but Phil said: "I talked to 
Ingemar last spring, and he said he didn't want to join the tour now because 
everyone would expect him to win immediately, and it's not the same format he 
was used to in the World Cup. Maybe he'll just race in the Super Series or give 
it a shot next year." 
</P>
<P>
And maybe he won't. 
</P>
<P>
The Swede, who won 86 World Cup races in 16 years and was a double Olympic gold 
medalist in 1980, when Phil took the silver medal behind him in the slalom, 
will be 34 in March. 
</P>
<P>
The Mahres will be 33 in May. So, will they try a third season of pro racing? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Phil said. "I'm just taking it year to year. But I'm away from 
home a lot now. Between skiing in the winter and racing cars in the summer, 
it's a bit much." 
</P>
<P>
Phil and Steve, who is divorced, both drove sports cars, representing Reno, in 
the Firestone American City Racing League this year. 
</P>
<P>
Phil finished seventh in the nine-race 2,000 series, which had four-driver 
teams from 11 western cities competing against one another. His best showings 
were seconds at Bakersfield's Mesa Marin Raceway and at Del Mar. He also won 
the pole at Portland International Raceway, where he was third. 
</P>
<P>
Steve drove in four events but took second place at Sears Point Raceway and 
third behind his brother at Mesa Marin, winding up 20th overall in individual 
standings as Reno finished second to Las Vegas in the team competition. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't take a particularly acute observer to detect an ongoing pattern 
here: Phil usually manages to edge out Steve, as was the case when they 
finished 1-2 in the 1984 Olympic slalom -- after spending almost the entire two 
weeks downplaying the importance of winning a medal. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, their seemingly blase attitude at Sarajevo shocked reporters, 
most of whom were unfamiliar with the Mahres' personalities. But insiders 
nodded knowingly as the gold and silver medals were being draped around the 
twins' necks on the final day of the Games. 
</P>
<P>
"A typical Mahre sandbagging job," said one. 
</P>
<P>
Steve's biggest day had occurred two years earlier, in the World Alpine 
Championships at Schladming, Austria, where he scored an upset victory in the 
giant slalom as Phil finished out of the medals. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, it has generally been Phil, winner of World Cup overall titles in 
1981, '82 and '83, who has been the dominant twin. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always pushed each other to do better," Phil said. "And that's been an 
important factor in our success." 
</P>
<P>
Even when they were members of the U.S. team, the twins trained together on 
their own, occasionally evoking criticism by some of the other racers. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew what we had to do to stay in shape," Phil said. "We didn't need to ski 
nine months a year. But we trained because we wanted to. Nobody had to force us 
to get out on the hill. We grew up in a ski area (White Pass, Wash., which the 
Mahres' father managed), and we enjoyed skiing." 
</P>
<P>
Such is not the case, Phil Mahre believes, with the men on the current U.S. 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"Skiing has become such an expensive sport that a lot of racers now are just 
spoiled rich kids who don't want to work hard," he said. "It's not the coaches' 
fault. They can only take them so far. They shouldn't have to kick them in the 
butt to make them go out and ski. The racers are given everything they need to 
win, and they can't do it." 
</P>
<P>
How much did you say you needed to ski for the United States again, Phil?

EWING HAS BECOME A CANDIDATE FOR MVP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GOLDSTEIN, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The drumbeats in New York for Patrick Ewing are growing louder and louder, and 
they carry the message to the rest of the country -- "MVP, MVP, MVP." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone seems to be jumping on the Ewing bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing receives considerable publicity from the New York media, but it is the 
recognition from his peers as the National Basketball Association's best player 
that is far more meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
During the Knicks' visit to Los Angeles Dec. 3, the Lakers' Magic Johnson, a 
two-time MVP, gave Ewing his endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got everyone in the country talking about him, not just New York," said 
Johnson. "The biggest difference I can see in his game is his tenacity. I 
thought he was playing about as good as he could last season, but this year 
he's been just unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
"Earlier in his career, he would fade into the background occasionally. No 
more. He hurts you inside and outside. His turnaround jumper is deadly, and he 
finds the open man when he's double-teamed. I don't know what turned the switch 
on, but it's going to be awful hard to turn it off." 
</P>
<P>
Ewing long has been an intimidating presence on defense, but it is the 
tremendous improvement on offense in raising his scoring average to 29.6 -- 
from a career mark of 21.2 entering the season -- that has impressed rival 
players. At his current rate, he should eclipse the Knicks' scoring record of 
2,303 set by Richie Guerin in the 1961-62 season. 
</P>
<P>
"With the numbers he's putting up now, Ewing is carrying his team," said the 
Chicago Bulls' Michael Jordan, the NBA scoring leader. "Injuries slowed him 
early in his career, but now he's definitely arrived. There's no question that 
he's the MVP at this point. Certainly, there are no centers playing any 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Ewing also made a lasting impression on former Soviet Union star Sarunas 
Marciulionis after scorching the Golden State Warriors for 44 points and 24 
rebounds in Oakland, Calif., Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a machine, just a machine," said Marciulionis, an NBA rookie. "Never in 
the world have I seen anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
Ewing's sudden emergence on offense -- featuring a turnaround jump shot as 
potent as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's retired sky hook -- mostly is credited to his 
new Coach, Stu Jackson, who has adopted a simple philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"Our game plan is to get Patrick the ball," said Jackson. "He's our first and 
last option." 
</P>
<P>
It was not always that way. At Georgetown, Hoyas Coach John Thompson perceived 
his 7-footer as a clone of Boston Celtics great Bill Russell. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson convinced Ewing he best served the Hoyas as a shot blocker and 
rebounder. Ewing averaged 15.3 points in four seasons at Georgetown, sharing 
the shooting with the likes of Reggie Williams and David Wingate. 
</P>
<P>
Hubie Brown, Ewing's first professional coach when he joined the Knicks in 1985 
as the No. 1 lottery pick, also kept tight reins on Ewing, viewing him as the 
eraser in his trapping defense. 
</P>
<P>
On offense, Brown may have slowed Ewing's maturation by switching him to power 
forward and moving Bill Cartwright into the middle. It was a strategy that 
contributed to Brown's dismissal in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Pitino, a Brown disciple, found more use for Ewing's offensive potential, 
but his failure to stress a half-court offense limited his center's scoring 
opportunities and led to the Knicks' upset by the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern 
playoff semifinals in May. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Ewing is the focal point of the Knicks' offense, and he has risen to the 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's any way to stop me, I'm not telling," Ewing said. "If I get the 
ball, I'm going to score, but if the shot's not there, I'll pass it out. That's 
particularly true in the last quarter. I have to defeat the double teams in 
different ways." 
</P>
<P>
The change in Ewing off the court has been equally dramatic. Once perceived as 
a sullen, uncooperative athlete highly suspicious of the media, he has adjusted 
to the relentless spotlight in New York. He now makes himself readily available 
after games, always courteous, if not expansive with his answers. 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't Patrick's fault," Johnson said of Ewing's past image. "It was how 
he was perceived. He was just being himself. Remember, in college, they seldom 
let him do interviews. But success can create a lot of changes in a person's 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
On the floor, Ewing's demeanor remains as intense as that of the Washington 
Bullets' Bernard King, who wears a perpetual scowl. 
</P>
<P>
Discussing his national rave reviews, Ewing said, "I'm greedy. I want the MVP 
award, but I know I can't get that without us winning big." 
</P>
<P>
With the Knicks in first place, Ewing has a jump on the MVP competition. Said 
Knicks reserve guard Trent Tucker, "If Ewing keeps it up, I know we'll still be 
playing in June."

<P>
DECADE IN REVIEW: ROSE'S SUSPENSION FROM BASEBALL AND BREAKING OF COBB'S RECORD 
ARE VOTED TOP STORIES OF THE '80S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Athletic achievement and athletic disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
They are the trademarks of the 1980s in sports, the best and the worst of 10 
tumultuous years that produced great accomplishments balanced by public 
humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
And as this roller-coaster ride reaches its conclusion, they are the thread 
that ties together the top stories of the decade, selected by sportswriters and 
broadcasters in an Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose was at both ends of that spectrum during the period, and 
appropriately, his adventures took the first two places in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
The gambling investigation that forced Rose out of baseball in 1989 was voted 
the top story for the period, and his relentless pursuit of Ty Cobb's all-time 
record of 4,191 hits, which he broke four years earlier, finished second. 
</P>
<P>
With a first-place vote worth 10 points, second place nine, etc., Rose's 
gambling had 116 firsts and 3,159 points, and Rose's pursuit of Cobb had 60 
firsts and 2,395 points. 
</P>
<P>
They were followed in order by the World Series earthquake (69), 2,142; sports 
labor, including soaring salaries and baseball and football strikes (9), 1,765; 
Nolan Ryan's 5,000 strikeouts (22), 1,593; the U.S.-Soviet Olympic boycotts 
(38), 1,495; Ben Johnson's steroids use (24), 1,491; Wayne Gretzky breaks 
Gordie Howe's scoring record (15), 1,406; Miracle on Ice: U.S. Olympic hockey 
(78), 1,210, and drugs, including Len Bias' cocaine death and Pittsburgh drug 
trials (47), 1,105. 
</P>
<P>
Rose's problems first surfaced in February, when he was summoned under rather 
mysterious circumstances from the Cincinnati Reds' training camp to meet in New 
York with Commissioner Peter Ueberroth and his successor, Bart Giamatti. The 
rumor was that the subject was gambling, but Rose, a frequent visitor to 
racetracks, shrugged it off. 
</P>
<P>
"That's been associated with me for 20 years," he said. "You can't control 
rumors." 
</P>
<P>
Baseball, too, seemed to downplay the affair at first. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked him to do it; we didn't order him," Ueberroth said of the visit. 
"There's nothing ominous and there won't be any follow-through." 
</P>
<P>
But that turned out to be more hopeful than accurate. It was very ominous, and 
there was a substantial follow-through. 
</P>
<P>
When Ueberroth left baseball and Giamatti took office, the Rose affair was 
turned over to John Dowd, a prominent Washington attorney. His investigation 
resulted in a 225-page report, a detailed indictment of the man whose hustle 
and drive as a player made him the embodiment of baseball for millions of fans. 
</P>
<P>
Each day, new sordid stories surfaced, linking Rose with bookmakers, 
organized-crime figures and other unsavory characters. The litany of charges 
accused him of all manner of things, not the least of which was betting on 
baseball, which calls for suspension from the sport. Rose battled back, suing 
the commissioner, winning a brief victory in a local court, losing on larger 
issues in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
The war continued all summer, hanging ominously over the game, blunting nearly 
everything else in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Finally in August, Rose gave up the fight and, though he never admitted to 
betting on baseball, was suspended for life, ending the sport's most sordid 
affair since the 1919 Black Sox scandal. It was also one of the commissioner's 
last acts. Eight days later, Giamatti died of a massive heart attack at his 
vacation home in Martha's Vineyard, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
In six months, Rose went from being one of the most hallowed figures in 
baseball history to being one of the most disgraced. It was a long, sad fall. 
</P>
<P>
Four years earlier, he reached the pinnacle of the game when, on Sept. 11, 
1985, he broke Cobb's record for career hits. In his 22nd season, doubling as 
player-manager of the Reds, he dropped a humpback line drive into left field 
against Eric Show of the San Diego Padres for the 4,192nd hit of his career. 
And as he stood at first base, embracing his son and his teammates, tears 
welled in his eyes. The Cobb chase was finally over. 
</P>
<P>
Rose had come to the Reds in 1963, a cocky, chip-on-the-shoulder kid making the 
jump from Class B to the majors. He flourished and within a few years was a 
full-fledged star. There were three batting championships, a record 44-game 
hitting streak in 1978 and 10 seasons in which he surpassed 200 hits. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, he found himself within hailing distance of Cobb's record. The last 
part of the journey, however, was not easy. 
</P>
<P>
He had left the Reds as a free agent after the 1978 season, signing with 
Philadelphia. At the end of the 1983 season, he had 3,990 hits -- 201 fewer 
than Cobb -- and was a free agent again, but with few takers this time. 
Finally, he hooked on with Montreal for half a season, then moved back to 
Cincinnati as player-manager to complete his pursuit. He finished 1984 with 
4,097 hits, still 94 short. 
</P>
<P>
Ninety-four hits was less than three months' work for Rose in his prime. Now, 
at age 44, it took him five months to reach it. When he got there, it was an 
achievement as monumental as Hank Aaron smashing Babe Ruth's record of 714 home 
runs, and the acclaim was just as universal. 
</P>
<P>
Aaron's place in baseball history remains secure 15 years after he broke Ruth's 
record. It took just four years for Rose's to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
WORLD SERIES EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
<P>
It was a beautiful fall afternoon in San Francisco, a perfect setting for Game 
3 of the 1989 World Series. The Oakland A's had won the first two games but the 
San Francisco Giants were hopeful that the switch to Candlestick Park would 
signal a change in their fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in a flash, baseball became distinctly secondary. The earth began moving. 
There was a frightening rumble as the ground shuddered, the upper deck lurched 
and the light towers swayed. The World Series was in the middle of a classic 
California earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
At first, there was a shrug-it-off reaction by the fans. Then the electricity 
went out, and when news arrived that part of the Bay Bridge had fallen, the 
realization set in that this was a full-scale disaster. 
</P>
<P>
It would be 10 days before baseball resumed and the A's completed their march 
to baseball's strangest World Series championship. 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS LABOR 
</P>
<P>
Never in the history of sports had athletes stood up to management as they did 
in the 1980s. Twice, in 1981 for 50 days and then again in 1985 for two days, 
baseball players shut down the game in midseason. Football players did the same 
thing, walking out for 57 days in 1982 and for 24 days in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The labor action forced unprecedented responses from the owners. Baseball 
played a split-season in 1981, crowning pre-strike and post-strike division 
champions and establishing a second tier of playoffs. Football played a 
nine-game season in 1982 followed by a tournament leading to the Super Bowl. In 
1987, the NFL hired replacement players and kept playing games while the 
regulars marched on picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's free-agent market went from the extreme of collusion that froze out 
the players for three years to a spurt of wild spending that pushed salaries 
past the $3-million mark. 
</P>
<P>
NOLAN RYAN'S 5,000TH STRIKEOUT 
</P>
<P>
Nolan Ryan struck out the first batter he ever faced in the major leagues on 
Sept. 11, 1966. But don't feel sorry for Pat Jarvis. Over the years, he would 
have plenty of company. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan was a rookie with a world of potential when he fanned Jarvis. Nearly 23 
years later, on Aug. 22, 1989, Ryan was still throwing fastballs at 95 m.p.h. 
when he got Rickey Henderson of the Oakland A's swinging at a 3-2 pitch for the 
5,000th strikeout of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan needed six strikeouts that night to reach 5,000 and he moved toward the 
target in a hurry. He got Jose Canseco in the first inning, Dave Henderson and 
Tony Phillips in the second, Rickey Henderson and Ron Hassey in the fourth and 
Rickey Henderson again in the fifth. "He gave me no chance," Henderson said. 
"He just blew it by me." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan's roster of victims includes 17 Hall of Famers and 42 players who have won 
MVP awards. Texas coach Davey Lopes, victimized six times by Ryan, once 
observed, "If he ain't struck you out, you ain't nobody." 
</P>
<P>
U.S.-SOVIET OLYMPIC BOYCOTTS 
</P>
<P>
In January of 1980, one month after Soviet troops crossed into Afghanistan, 
President Jimmy Carter announced that unless they withdrew within the next 30 
days, the United States would ask that the Olympic Games, scheduled for that 
summer in Moscow, either be postponed or moved. 
</P>
<P>
One month later, in the midst of the Lake Placid Winter Games, with the Moscow 
Olympics still in place, Carter announced an American boycott of the Summer 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
A number of western nations supported the action, although some, like Britain 
and Australia, allowed their athletes to decide for themselves whether they 
would compete. That freedom was denied American competitors, who were 
threatened with revocation of their passports if they traveled to the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, with the Summer Games in Los Angeles, the Soviets responded 
in kind. On May 8, 1984, the day an extensive Olympic torch relay began across 
the United States, the Soviet Union announced its own boycott, citing "a gross 
flouting" of Olympic ideals by U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
BEN JOHNSON'S STEROID USE 
</P>
<P>
Their showdown had been one of the most widely anticipated events of the 1988 
Seoul Olympics. Now, the stadium clock clicked off the seconds in fractions as 
Carl Lewis and Ben Johnson swept down the track, their bodies straining for the 
finish of the 100-meter race. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson got there first, an instant ahead of Lewis. As he broke the tape, the 
clock read 9.79 seconds, a remarkable time, faster than any man had ever run 
the distance. He glared across at Lewis. His longtime rival was a well-beaten 
second in 9.92. Ben Johnson was an Olympic gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
Three days later, it all came apart for Johnson. A post-race urine sample 
showed traces of the banned steroid, stanozolol. Despite his denials, he was 
stripped of his medal and left Seoul in disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was suspecting it," American quarter-miler Danny Everett said. "You 
look at old pictures of him and new pictures. . . . You don't expect one of the 
top athletes to get caught. The top athletes are usually smart enough not to 
get caught." 
</P>
<P>
WAYNE GRETZKY BREAKS GORDIE HOWE'S RECORD 
</P>
<P>
For 26 brilliant seasons, Gordie Howe terrorized NHL goalies, and when he was 
done, he had 1,850 points, the most in history. The last one came in 1980, the 
year rookie Wayne Gretzky broke into the league, leading it in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next decade, Gretzky would set or share 44 regular-season, postseason 
and career scoring records. It was only a matter of time before he broke the 
most cherished mark of all, and on Oct. 15, at the start of his 11th season, 
Gretzky shattered Howe's scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
He did it in dramatic fashion, scoring a goal in the final minute of a game 
against his old Edmonton teammates and then scoring another in overtime to win 
it for the Kings. The record that Howe set in 1,767 games was broken in 
Gretzky's 780th NHL game. 
</P>
<P>
But that hardly diminished Howe. Certainly not in the mind of Gretzky, who grew 
up idolizing him. 
</P>
<P>
"Gordie still is the greatest in my mind," he said, "and the greatest in 
everyone else's mind." 
</P>
<P>
MIRACLE ON ICE: U.S. OLYMPIC HOCKEY 
</P>
<P>
The young U.S. hockey team weaved its way through the early rounds of the 1980 
Winter Olympic tournament, salvaging a tie against Sweden in the opener with a 
last-minute score, then beating Czechoslovakia, Norway, Romania and West 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The reward was a berth in the medal round and a match against the perennial 
champion Soviet Union, a team that had embarrassed the Americans, 10-3, in an 
exhibition the week before the Lake Placid Games. This time, though, it would 
be different. This time the roster full of college kids would come up with a 
miracle on ice. 
</P>
<P>
Three times, they fell behind and three times they came back to tie the score. 
Then with 10 minutes to play, Mike Eruzione scored the go-ahead goal, and for 
what seemed an eternity, the Americans skated furiously to protect the lead. 
"It was the longest 10 minutes of my life," Eruzione said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the last seconds of the game ticked away, and the Americans had a most 
improbable victory. Two days later, after beating Finland, they also had the 
gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS 
</P>
<P>
On June 17, 1986, the Boston Celtics made Maryland's Len Bias the second choice 
in the NBA draft. Two days later, the 6-foot-8 power forward was dead of a 
cocaine overdose. 
</P>
<P>
Eight days after Bias died, on the weekend he was to be married, Cleveland 
Browns defensive back Don Rogers also took cocaine and also died of an 
overdose. 
</P>
<P>
The two deaths so close together were the exclamation points in a drug epidemic 
that hounded sports during the decade. No sport was immune, with baseball, 
football, basketball and hockey all forced to suspend players for drug 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most embarrassing episode was the Pittsburgh drug trial in 1985, 
when a parade of major league stars testified before a federal grand jury, 
detailing substance abuse in baseball. After it was over, Ueberroth disciplined 
21 players in March of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Did the penalties have much effect on sports? 
</P>
<P>
Three months after they were announced, Bias and Rogers died. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

CARL BANKS IS DOMINATING AGAIN, AND SO ARE THE GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heads turned when Carl Banks walked into a team meeting at the New York Giants' 
training camp. The linebacker was wearing a T-shirt heralding a "Return to 
Dominance." 
</P>
<P>
It was no empty slogan. 
</P>
<P>
After an unproductive season in 1988, when the Giants failed to make the 
playoffs for the second consecutive season after having won Super Bowl XXI, 
Banks vowed to lead a return to championship form. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hell last year," Banks said. "I was struggling. I'd look at things on 
film and I just couldn't believe I was playing that way. But there were several 
factors involved and I got everything ironed out." 
</P>
<P>
Banks missed all of training camp because of a contract dispute last season. He 
signed a $3.6-million, four-year contract one week before the season began. 
</P>
<P>
"He said that he's a better player than what he showed last year and I concur," 
said George Young, the Giants' general manager. "Last year he was a holdout and 
I think it affected his play tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
Out of condition after missing training camp, Banks suffered a bruised knee, a 
bruised shoulder and a sprained wrist. And his effectiveness declined. 
</P>
<P>
An All-NFL and Pro Bowl pick in 1987, Banks has rebounded this season. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Coach Art Shell was impressed after watching film of Banks in 
preparation for Sunday's game against the Giants at the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so strong at the point of attack," Shell said. "We go over their 
personnel as a coaching staff and by the time (assistant coach) Terry Robiskie 
got done talking about their outside linebackers, I said, 'You mean we can't 
run the ball at all? We might as well go home.' " 
</P>
<P>
Banks has led the Giants to within one victory of the NFC East championship, 
which they can clinch by beating the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lawrence Taylor, the Giants' all-pro linebacker, gets most of the 
attention because he is such a ferocious pass rusher, some consider Banks to be 
as good as Taylor. When Taylor was injured earlier this season, it was Banks 
who sustained the Giant defense. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bother me at all that Lawrence gets the publicity that he does 
because he deserves it," Banks said. "I think he's a great player. I'm a big 
fan of his. I think one thing that people should keep in mind is that Lawrence 
and I are two totally different players." 
</P>
<P>
With the retirement of linebacker Harry Carson and defensive tackle Jim Burt 
signing with San Francisco, Banks has become a team leader. Although he is 
soft-spoken, his teammates voted him and Taylor defensive co-captains. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally I'm not an outspoken type of guy because I try to lead by example," 
Banks said. "Upon being named captain, I didn't feel like I had to change 
anything because the guys chose me captain for the man that I am." 
</P>
<P>
George Perles, who coached Banks at Michigan State, always considered Banks a 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
"When he was about ready to be drafted, I always said that someday he'd be a 
captain of one of the NFL teams," Perles said. "He reminded me of Joe Greene, 
not as a player but as a leader. He demanded respect from opponents without 
saying a word, like Joe Greene, because he could hurt someone. 
</P>
<P>
"He had the same kind of direction and leadership as Joe Greene. I think it 
comes from his family. His mom and dad are class people." 
</P>
<P>
Charles Banks was furious with his son Carl, who stole a crayon at elementary 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"He brought it home and I knew we didn't buy it," Charles Banks said. "He said 
the teacher gave it to him so I took him back to school to check with his 
teacher and she didn't remember giving it to him." 
</P>
<P>
Carl Banks said: "I remember that like it was yesterday. My father was always 
telling us never to steal. Ask for things and if you don't get them, you don't 
need them." 
</P>
<P>
But Banks thought no one would miss one crayon. 
</P>
<P>
"There were hundreds of crayons so I picked one up and brought it home," Banks 
said. "My father noticed everything and he knew that he didn't buy me a crayon. 
He asked me where I got the crayon and I said the teacher gave it to me and he 
said he didn't think the teacher gave me one crayon. 
</P>
<P>
"He said we were going to go to school and ask the teacher and I said fine 
because I was trying to call his bluff. He told me if I was lying I'd get a 
spanking in front of the whole class. It's funny now but it affected me for 
life. He pulled a chair in front of the teacher's desk and I had to lay across 
his lap and I got a whipping. 
</P>
<P>
"And I haven't touched anything that didn't belong to me again." 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, Banks was grounded for a month after swearing in gym 
class. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the quietest guy in class from then on," Banks said. "He did a great job 
of keeping us on the right track." 
</P>
<P>
A correctional officer for the State of Michigan, Charles Banks works at a 
halfway house, where he helps juvenile prisoners prepare to re-enter society. 
</P>
<P>
And he believes that discipline starts at home. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to keep Carl in check," Charles Banks said. "But he didn't have time 
to get into a lot of trouble because he was always playing sports." 
</P>
<P>
Recruited by Oklahoma and Michigan State, Banks chose Michigan State so his 
parents would be able to see him play. 
</P>
<P>
While in college, Banks dug graves at a cemetery to earn extra money. The job 
earned him a nickname, Killer. 
</P>
<P>
"The work wasn't easy, but I enjoyed it," Banks said. "As a matter of fact, I 
worked there year after year, so I had to enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
But Banks quit digging graves after he was selected third in the 1984 draft by 
the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
After signing a $1.6-million, four-year contract, Banks offered to buy his 
parents a house. When they chose not to move, Banks had their old house 
remodeled and bought a satellite dish so they could watch all of his games. He 
also bought a Cadillac and a Mercedes-Benz for his folks, and is paying the 
college tuition of his younger brother, Bankston. 
</P>
<P>
If Banks' childhood dream had come true, he would be playing in the NBA instead 
of the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"Basketball was always my first love," Banks said. "But what spoiled it for me 
was (fellow Michigan State athlete) Magic Johnson, and you can tell him I said 
it because we're good friends. Before he came into the NBA as a 6-9 guard, guys 
like me could be a small forward." 
</P>
<P>
An undersized but rugged center at 6 feet 4 inches and 235 pounds, Banks led 
the basketball team at Beecher High in Flint to three conference titles. An 
all-state selection, he averaged 19 points and 10 rebounds as a senior in 
leading his team to a 24-2 record and the semifinals of the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Although Banks was a good basketball player, Moses Lacy, his coach, knew Banks' 
future was in football, where he earned all-state honors as a defensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
"He could play above the rim," said Lacy. "He had strong moves inside. We had a 
lot of schools after him for basketball, but his family and I are real close 
and I told them he was a good high school basketball player, but he would make 
one hell of a college football player." 
</P>
<P>
Banks said: "I didn't want to hear it, but Lacy was right." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
After moving into the starting lineup midway through his freshman season, Banks 
started 43 of 44 games for Michigan State, where he finished his career with 
279 tackles, third most in school history. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't easy for me at Michigan State at first because I didn't have a 
position," Banks said. "It was either tight end or linebacker and the only 
reason I became a linebacker is that we were running a pass-catching drill. The 
coach would throw me the ball and I would run it back to him. And he said, 'No, 
that's what defensive players do. You're supposed to run the opposite 
direction.' 
</P>
<P>
"But I just couldn't get it out of my mind and they sent me over with the 
linebackers and there I was." 
</P>
<P>
Banks credits Perles, who coached him only as a senior at Michigan State, with 
giving him direction and helping his development. 
</P>
<P>
"He came down hard on me and I couldn't understand it because I had good grades 
and I was always on time," Banks said. "But for some reason, he had to make an 
example out of me so he started at the top. It seemed like everything I did on 
the field was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
During one meeting, Perles told Banks that he had a lot to learn and wasn't as 
good a player as he thought he was. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing how these things come back as positives," Perles said. "When 
you're getting after them, you worry about it. I think he was bright enough to 
see that he had a chance to be a pro if he worked hard and dedicated himself." 
Banks' work paid off. He became a consensus All-American as a senior and played 
in the Hula Bowl, Senior Bowl and the Blue-Gray game. 
</P>
<P>
Though he is a successful pro, Banks hasn't forgotten his roots. He returns 
home each summer and conducts a football camp. He also buys shoes for the 
Beecher High football team and bought new warmup uniforms for the basketball 
team several years ago. "Carl came to a game and afterward he asked me if those 
were the same warmups he was wearing when he was playing," Lacy said. "He said 
he was going to buy us new ones. We were ranked No. 1 in the state at the time 
and I wouldn't let the kids wear them until we got to the state tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Wearing its new warmups, Beecher won the state tournament. No one was prouder 
than Carl Banks. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to do things like that because these are people who influenced me 
greatly," Banks said. "When the going gets tough now, I think back on some of 
(Lacy's) teaching to get me through tough times, be it in a game or in life."

Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mike Haynes, who has not played since November, will be used to replace backup 
safety Russell Carter in the team's six-back defensive scheme on passing downs. 
Carter, hobbled by a hamstring pull, was put on injured reserve. To replace 
him, the Raiders waived, then re-signed backup wide receiver Timmie Ware.

A ROLE PLAYER'S DREAM SEASON; 
</P>
<P>
PATRIOTS: FORMER CHARGER AND RAM TIGHT END SIEVERS REBUILDS HIS REPUTATION BY 
LEADING NEW ENGLAND IN RECEPTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Eric Sievers was having an identity crisis. 
</P>
<P>
He had spent the better part of eight seasons with the San Diego Chargers, 
building a reputation as a solid tight end, a good blocker and a 
less-than-spectacular receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Shoulder and neck injuries had reduced his ability to slam into linebackers 
with the same kind of effectiveness, however, and the Chargers let him pass 
through waivers while attempting to bring him off the injured reserve list late 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams claimed him off the waiver wire on Dec. 7, 1988, and Sievers played in 
one regular- season and one playoff game before becoming an unprotected Plan B 
free agent at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Sievers signed with New England March 31 and discovered he was one of six tight 
ends in the Patriots' training camp. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Steinberg, then New England's director of player development, assured him 
that the tight end would be a primary receiver in the Patriot offense and he 
was very much a part of those plans. 
</P>
<P>
Sievers wanted to believe it, but he couldn't help being a bit skeptical. After 
all, he had caught only three passes in three years, and Patriot tight ends had 
combined for only 21 receptions in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to cut me," Sievers told Steinberg, "let me know now and I'll 
just retire." 
</P>
<P>
Sievers got the assurances he needed, and decided to wait and see. The Patriots 
kept their word. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Eric Sievers, 32, who supposedly couldn't block anymore and allegedly 
never could catch, leads the team in receptions. He has a career-high 51 
catches for a career-high 583 yards going into Sunday's game against the Rams 
at Foxboro, Mass. In his last four games, he has caught 35 passes for 312 
yards, almost matching his best seasons, a pair of 41-reception, 438-yard 
efforts in 1984 and '85. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a really fun year for me, even though we haven't won that many 
games," Sievers said. "I'm at least taking an active part in what we're doing 
offensively. I'd rather be a guy playing on a team like the Patriots (instead 
of) on a winner and not getting onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had stayed with the Rams, I was going to be the backup guy, or maybe the 
guy who was there to persuade (holdout) Damone Johnson to come into camp. I saw 
Plan B as a great opportunity. I took less pay here, but I've made it up in 
incentives." 
</P>
<P>
He also got a new identity out of the deal, going from washed-up run blocker to 
crunch-time receiver and team leader. 
</P>
<P>
If he had changed his name, no one would have guessed the guy wearing No. 85 
for New England was Eric Sievers. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric has been a critical part of our offense all year long," Patriot Coach 
Raymond Berry said. "He's been consistent and made big plays all year long. And 
if he hadn't, we'd be even worse off than we are (5-10)." 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, who would have believed that an NFL coach would be saying 
those kinds of things about Sievers? 
</P>
<P>
"The last three years, I've been pretty much an inactive offensive player," 
Sievers said. "Now, I'm pretty much the receiving end, the guy they send in on 
passing downs, which is quite a contrast to what I was in San Diego, where I 
was just a blocker and short-yardage receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"It's also quite a contrast from what the Rams had outlined for me. When I 
talked to (Ram offensive coordinator) Ernie Zampese before Plan B, he said, 'If 
you get a better offer, take it because you'll be our third guy.' " 
</P>
<P>
It's not as if Sievers hadn't accepted such a role before, especially in his 
last three years at San Diego when he played in just 26 games and averaged one 
catch a season. But Plan B gave him a chance to go shopping. And then he got 
the surprise call from New England, a place where tight ends traditionally are 
nothing more than tackles with higher numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"I was certainly a little skeptical when they called because I knew their tight 
end was really a blocker and I didn't think they'd want an undersized 
(6-foot-4, 238-pound) tight end to be their blocker," Sievers said. 
"Especially, when I knew they had an excellent blocker in Lin Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
"But they said they planned on using the tight end in the passing game more, 
and I thought that was probably my strong suit now . . . even though I hadn't 
been used that way much." 
</P>
<P>
Sievers isn't quite sure why the Patriots decided he was the man for the job, 
but it has been a task he has relished. Injuries to a number of wide receivers 
and running backs who had been instrumental in the Patriots' passing game have 
made Sievers the primary receiver in clutch situations. 
</P>
<P>
"We had that plan before the season, to work the tight end in a lot more, so it 
was a timely arrival for Eric," Berry said. "We've had a lot of injuries, but 
he's been one consistency in the lineup. We're set up to utilize the tight end 
more, and because he's done so well, we've done more to try to get him the 
ball. He's getting open and catching it." 
</P>
<P>
His growing reputation as a sure-handed receiver has been another bit of 
fulfilled fantasy for Sievers. He sounds as if he's not sure it's true. 
</P>
<P>
"I stepped in as a role player, a guy who learned the routes and knew how to 
run them against different defenses," he said, "but actually, I've even 
developed a knack for catching the ball here. I actually feel more confident 
catching the ball here than I did at any time of my career in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't put myself in the same category of ability as Pete Holohan, but as far 
as confidence in myself to catch the ball (goes), I feel I can make any catch 
they need me to make." 
</P>
<P>
The struggling Patriots have needed every catch he has made. It's not as if 
they haven't been moving the ball. They're just not getting into the end zone 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
New England is averaging 338 yards a game and has 34 more first downs than its 
opponents, but the Patriots have been outscored by almost 100 points (367-277). 
</P>
<P>
"Our problem all year long has been our inability to get the ball in the end 
zone from inside the 20," Sievers said. "After every game, we've felt good 
about the effort. And we usually have led in time of possession, but that 
doesn't always lead to victory. We've killed that theory." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem has been the lack of stability at quarterback. Four 
quarterbacks -- Doug Flutie, Tony Eason, Marc Wilson and Steve Grogan -- have 
been given a shot with the Patriots this season. They have combined for 16 
touchdown passes and 24 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The battle has been heated, more so in the press than on the field, pitting 
Grogan, the 15-year veteran who leads the club in virtually every career 
passing statistic, against Wilson, the former Raider, and Flutie, the 1984 
Heisman Trophy winner who led New England through a 6-3 stretch late last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Eason now is with the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Sievers, although admitting that "this is the harshest media market I've ever 
seen," said the quarterback controversy has not filtered through the team. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sievers has done nothing but make friends in the Boston area. He has 
more catches and more yards than either of the AFC's Pro Bowl tight ends -- 
Rodney Holman of Cincinnati and Ferrell Edmunds of Miami -- but don't even 
mention the Pro Bowl to him. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, I'm not even the starting tight end here," he said, referring to the 
fact that Dawson starts. "I've always been a guy who fills a role, and that's 
what made me feel so good about this year. I wouldn't care if I had only caught 
15 balls this year, at least I would know they were counting on me. That's 
probably been the biggest boost to my confidence. I have the confidence I can 
still play football, and that was something I lost during the last couple of 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams placed safety Anthony Newman on injured reserve and activated running 
back Mel Farr Jr. from their developmental squad Friday. Newman fractured his 
left elbow last week. The Rams also signed linebacker Jerry Leggett of Cal 
State Fullerton to a developmental contract. . . . New England placed defensive 
end Kenneth Sims on injured reserve with a sprained right knee and activated 
defensive end Peter Shorts.

NBA drug counselor Dr. David Lewis said that the league has no immediate plans 
to reinstate suspended Dallas Maverick forward Roy Tarpley. 
</P>
<P>
Tarpley was suspended without pay by the league on Nov. 16 after he was 
arrested on a Dallas freeway on charges of driving while intoxicated and 
resisting arrest. A January court date has been set on those charges, although 
a plea bargain is likely. 
</P>
<P>
It had been reported last week that Tarpley might be reinstated for Friday 
night's game against the Clippers.

LATE GOAL GIVES CANADIENS A 2-2 TIE WITH THE SABRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years the Buffalo Sabres have looked great on paper, but not too 
sharp on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
However, under first-year Coach Rick Dudley, they are beginning to look good on 
the ice, too. 
</P>
<P>
Although they haven't played in many important games for sometime, they 
responded willingly in a showdown with Montreal Friday night at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
But they allowed Shayne Corson to get free and he scored with just two seconds 
left in regulation to get the Canadiens a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens had pulled goaltender Brian Hayward for an extra attacker when 
the Sabres iced the puck with five seconds remaining. The puck just missed 
going into the open net. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens won the ensuing faceoff and defenseman Chris Chelios found Corson 
open near the side of the net. Corson scored his 14th goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres, with Pierre Turgeon scoring his 18th goal, then setting up Rick 
Vaive for his 14th, dominated the early play. 
</P>
<P>
With a 22-9-5 record, the Sabres are nearing the midway point of the season 
with a four-point lead in the Adams Division over the Canadiens. Buffalo has 
the best record in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to leave the message that we're still around," Canadien Coach 
Pat Burns said. "The Sabres are the hot team." 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 5, Philadelphia 4 -- Kirk Muller scored at 1:18 of overtime at 
Philadelphia to lift the surprising Devils. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils, now 2-0-1 this season at the Spectrum, moved within one point of 
the first-place Flyers and New York Rangers in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the third straight for the Flyers, who dropped to 16-16-4 in their 
last home game until Jan. 11. They begin a seven-game road trip tonight in 
Montreal. New Jersey also got back to the .500 mark with a 16-16-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
"A win like this can give us a big lift," Coach John Cunniff said. "It would be 
a nice Christmas present if we could win tomorrow night and move into first 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 5, Chicago 3 -- Tom Fergus and Ed Olczyk scored 18 seconds apart in the 
third period at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Maple Leafs had just killed off a four-minute power-play when Fergus took a 
pass from Daniel Marois, when around Dave Manson and beat Jacques Cloutier with 
a 20-foot wrist shot at 5:34. 
</P>
<P>
Olczyk, a former Blackhawk, then beat Cloutier from the left circle for a 4-2 
lead. The loss ended Cloutier's eight-game winning streak at Chicago Stadium.

THIS TIME, IT WAS A BRONCO RUNAWAY; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: BOBBY HUMPHREY HAS GIVEN DENVER'S OFFENSE 1,100 YARDS AND ITS 
DEFENSE SOME EXTRA TIME TO REST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When reasons are sought for the Denver Broncos' return to prominence this 
season, the first thing mentioned is their beefed-up defense. 
</P>
<P>
Without a doubt, the unit assembled by defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, 
successor to the deposed Joe Collier, has been a major factor in the Broncos' 
turnaround from 8-8 also-rans to AFC West champions. The Broncos' yield of 207 
points is the lowest in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
But the defense has not done it all. Just as important, Coach Dan Reeves 
finally has found a running game to complement the passing of quarterback John 
Elway. 
</P>
<P>
For more years than Denver fans care to remember, Bronco running backs could 
best have been described as plodders. Now, though, Bobby Humphrey has arrived 
from Alabama, and the drought is over. In his rookie season, Humphrey has 
become the Broncos' first 1,000-yard runner since Otis Armstrong in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
A career-high 128-yard day last Saturday pushed Humphrey's total to an even 
1,100. He needs only 54 yards against the Chargers Sunday at San Diego Jack 
Murphy Stadium to take second place on the Broncos' all-time single-season 
list, behind Armstrong's 1,407 of 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey isn't the only rookie in the Denver backfield. Two others, first Jeff 
Alexander and now Mel Bratton, have handled the fullback duties, most of which 
involve blocking for Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, with an over-the-hill Tony Dorsett operating as the main back, the 
Broncos' running game ranked 19th in the league. Now it ranks fifth, and the 
emergence of Humphrey is largely responsible. 
</P>
<P>
What may not occur to the average fan is that this newly discovered offensive 
weapon has contributed to the Broncos' improvement on defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby Humphrey has allowed us to do things with our running game that take the 
pressure off our defense," Reeves said. "It has allowed us to eat up the clock, 
and when the defense is not on the field a lot, that's very important. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby has natural instincts, great instincts, and he knows the blocking 
schemes as well as any runner I've seen. He anticipates blocks almost before 
they're made." 
</P>
<P>
According to the leader of the Denver defense, Karl Mecklenburg, Reeves didn't 
overstate the case. 
</P>
<P>
"The running game has meant everything to us," Mecklenburg said. "We used to 
have the same problem that San Diego had when Dan Fouts was in his prime. Our 
offense scored points so quickly that the defense went right back on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer the defense is out there, the greater the danger of giving up a big 
play. Also, we're not turning the ball over, so we keep possession for long 
periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
"Humphrey and Bratton are great football players. With them, we're a much 
better balanced football team. We don't rely on our passing game anymore. You 
win games running, you win games passing, you win games with turnovers and you 
win games defensively." 
</P>
<P>
Both Humphrey and Bratton were steals in the draft. Both were held back by 
injuries suffered in college, and in both cases the Broncos stepped in where 
most other teams feared to tread. 
</P>
<P>
Bratton was regarded as a certain first-round draft choice at Miami until he 
tore up his left knee in the 1988 Orange Bowl game. The Miami Dolphins picked 
him in the sixth round, but he didn't sign, so he went back into the draft for 
1989. Even though he hadn't played at all last year, the Broncos took a flyer 
on him in the seventh round, and he is now their starting fullback. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey went into the 1988 season as a Heisman Trophy candidate at Alabama, 
but he had suffered a stress fracture in his left foot in spring practice and 
reinjured the foot in the second game. He missed the rest of the season and 
could have stayed for a redshirt year but elected instead to go into the 
supplemental draft. The Broncos used their first-round pick for 1990 to take 
him, and they struck gold. 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey, 23, was a two-time All-American and a premier receiver as well as 
runner. He averaged 5.5 yards a carry as he rushed for 3,783 yards and 37 
touchdowns. He also caught 70 passes for 600 yards and eight touchdowns, and 
returned 48 kickoffs for a 21.9-yard average. He even completed his only pass 
for 57 yards and a touchdown, a feat he repeated last week with a 17-yard pass 
to Bratton. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his 1,100 yards rushing and seven touchdowns thus far in his first pro 
season, Humphrey has caught 20 passes for 141 yards. He has been named an 
alternate for the Pro Bowl in Honolulu on Feb. 4 and is a strong candidate for 
rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
All this has left the 6-foot-1, 200-pound Humphrey wondering how he could have 
done so much so soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I never expected these things, not at all," he said. "A lot of it is shocking, 
because everything happened to me so late. 
</P>
<P>
"I was only in camp three or four days before the last (exhibition) game, and I 
didn't do so well in that. Then I bruised a thigh, and I couldn't maneuver the 
way I wanted to. I knew all along it could be done, but I didn't think it could 
be done this year. I had no idea I would come right in and be a starter." 
</P>
<P>
After playing a reserve role for four games, Humphrey gained 102 yards against 
the Chargers in his first pro start. He now ranks fifth in the AFC, 282 yards 
behind leading Christian Okoye of Kansas City, and one wonders where he would 
be if he had been a regular all season. 
</P>
<P>
"Bratton has been a big help to me." Humphrey said. "He's a great blocker. 
Alexander is, too. I wouldn't be anywhere near where I am without them." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his own blocking, Humphrey laughed and said, "I'm improving a lot. 
I never did block in college, so I'm learning from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey sometimes feels awe-struck playing in the same backfield with Elway. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just amazing," Humphrey said. "You hear all about great players like that 
and you see them on television, but you never know you'll be in the company of 
those guys. You just never imagine anything like that. It's a big honor." 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey recalled that he agonized quite a while before deciding to give up his 
last season at Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough decision for me," he said. "I couldn't go into the regular 
draft in April because I don't think it would be appropriate with my foot still 
in a cast. At one point I didn't know what to do, so I waited until the 
deadline for the supplemental draft in June. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked out for 15 clubs, but I was unimpressive, because I had just come off 
the injury and hadn't fully recovered. When I finally decided to go to the 
pros, I was very disappointed that I lasted until the 17th pick. A lot of 
people thought I wasn't going to make it, so I had something to prove. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping I'd wind up in someplace warm, but I'm happy the way things 
turned out." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Humphrey is no happier than Reeves, who thought all along that the 
running back was worth the gamble. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no question that we would take him," Reeves said. "The only question 
was whether he would be there when we picked. We knew his foot was OK, and we 
knew he wasn't in shape when he worked out, which turned off some clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, he hadn't played in a year, and when you've got a guy with an injury, 
you don't really make plans. You just hope he can show he's over the injury. 
But then we saw him in the (exhibition) game against Dallas, and we started to 
say we'd better make some plans." 
</P>
<P>
A lot of scouts who passed on Humphrey have red faces today. He never had 
blazing speed -- "I'm like a 4.7 (seconds) in the 40(-yard dash)," he said -- 
but he had great moves and body control, and he didn't lose anything because of 
his injury. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm more of a Marcus Allen runner," he said, comparing his style to that of 
the Raider veteran. "I guess you could say I'm a slasher." 
</P>
<P>
Becoming a 1,000-yard runner as a rookie hasn't lulled Humphrey into 
self-satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"It has given me confidence and more incentive, but I know I still need work on 
some things," he said. "I have to get better at reading blocks and improve my 
run-blocking. When I do that, I can compete with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
And how is Reeves to play for? 
</P>
<P>
"He's all right," Humphrey said. "He tough, and he has his moments. 
Fortunately, I learn fast, and I try not to make the same mistake twice."

PARCELLS HAS DONE THE JOB; WALTON HASN'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just for the moment, let's go back to the future. To the days after the 1982 
season, when New York's two NFL teams found themselves in similar 
circumstances. Both the Giants and the Jets had accepted the resignations of 
their head coaches and had nominated assistants to succeed Ray Perkins and Walt 
Michaels. 
</P>
<P>
If you had to choose then, who would you have picked as the man with the 
greater job security? How many would have said Bill Parcells, a largely 
anonymous defensive coach with minimal professional experience and a team that 
had finished the strike season with a disappointing 4-5 record? His counterpart 
on the other side of the Hudson was Joe Walton, a widely-respected offensive 
specialist with a New York (Giant) player pedigree who was inheriting a young 
club that had fallen one victory short of the Super Bowl. Be honest, now: the 
vote wouldn't have been close. 
</P>
<P>
Both men still are in their posts. They and their teams will occupy the east 
side of the field at Giants Stadium, which has been home to both the Giants and 
Jets since 1984, on successive days this weekend. The games will be the 111th 
for Parcells and Walton in regular-season play. In all probability, never again 
will they be so closely identified. 
</P>
<P>
Win or lose on Sunday, when the Giants host the Raiders, Parcells will be 
coaching in the playoffs for the fourth time in seven years. He has a year 
remaining on his contract and can stay longer, much longer, if he so chooses. 
Win or lose today, when the Jets engage the Bills, Walton will be elsewhere 
next season. Although he has two years left on his contract, the man will be 
asked to vacate his office by new General Manager Dick Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
How did Parcells thrive and Walton ultimately fail? There's no easy answer. As 
recently as a year ago, in fact, it wasn't entirely clear that Walton would be 
the first to leave. On Dec. 18, 1988, the Jets staged a suspenseful final drive 
to defeat the Giants, 27-21, knocking their rivals out of playoff contention 
and salvaging a winning season. The coaches' records after that game were 
52-42-1 for Parcells and 49-45-1 for Walton. 
</P>
<P>
It's true Parcells did have the advantage of a Super Bowl victory following the 
1986 season. In the same year, the Jets had been the sensation of the league 
through the first 11 weeks, winning 10 times. Five ignominious defeats 
followed, but still the Jets held a 20-10 lead over the Browns in Cleveland 
with 4:14 remaining and a berth in the AFC championship game at stake. They 
couldn't hang on and eventually lost in double overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Both franchises -- and both coaches -- suffered from the strike in 1987. The 
Giants and Jets each staggered to a 6-9 record, and Parcells and Walton 
alienated many players when the full squads returned to work. Although the 
Giants went 10-6 against a soft schedule in 1988, it was the perception of many 
(the Jets' hierarchy included) that the Jets, at 8-7-1, were making greater 
strides. 
</P>
<P>
Now we know better. In 1989, while Walton's Jets were developing a seven-year 
itch, Parcells and his team gained stature not only in New York but also around 
the league. The gap between the teams and the coaches has grown into a chasm. 
It is Steinberg's mission to bridge the wasteland between the 11-4 Giants and 
the 4-11 Jets. He will attempt it with a coach of his own choosing. 
</P>
<P>
So where did it go wrong for Walton? Certainly, he had injuries. From a defense 
that was a dominant force, he lost the likes of Joe Klecko, Lance Mehl and Bob 
Crable to severe knee conditions. Marty Lyons has suffered a variety of 
ailments. Mark Gastineau finally flipped out. 
</P>
<P>
But Parcells was not without problems. He lost three players to cancer, 
including Karl Nelson, whose absence caused a major revamping of the offensive 
line that starred in the Super Bowl. He started this season without three 
leaders of a proud defense -- Harry Carson, George Martin and Jim Burt -- and 
had to do without his major running threat, Joe Morris, after an injury in the 
final preseason game. Somehow, he managed. 
</P>
<P>
After a year of offering public support and encouragement to his players, 
Walton grew distant again as the losses mounted in 1989. He minded his tongue 
but benched veterans. Among them was Ken O'Brien, the quarterback he had 
developed, at a time when his only alternative was a virtual novice. Nothing 
seemed to work. By contrast, Parcells patted a few backs and needled others, 
including warhorse Ottis Anderson, to unexpected performances. He motivated on 
a personal basis. The clubhouse was his house, too, while Walton directed 
through his assistants. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the major difference in the stories of the two men, however, was in the 
structure of their organizations. Parcells had a strong football man above him, 
a general manager named George Young who knew personnel and supported his 
coach. He helped Parcells grow into a job that seemed too big in 1983, when the 
coach anointed Scott Brunner as his quarterback and the team finished 3-12-1. 
At the top of the Jets, there was only a vacuum, one which Walton and a few 
others sought to fill with erratic and, eventually, disastrous results. 
</P>
<P>
The tale of two coaches ends this weekend. At least, there will be one winner.

LIQUOR ADVERTISING FLOWS FREELY DURING HOLIDAYS, BUT SOME CALL FOR TEMPERANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Michel Roux hopes consumers caught his Absolut vodka ad splashed on the back 
cover of this month's California magazine. 
</P>
<P>
But just in case they didn't, Roux put the Absolut ad on the back page of 
December's Vogue, Elle, Spy, Spin, Interview, Working Woman and Horticulture -- 
40 publications in all. Roux has good reason to bust his ad budget during the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"The holiday season accounts for one-quarter of Absolut sales," said Roux, 
chief executive of Carillon Importers, which distributes 2 million cases a year 
of the nation's best-selling vodka. "Like department stores, it's the time of 
year to be in business." 
</P>
<P>
Gift-giving and party-going make it the best of times for spirit sales. About 
one-third of the nation's $24 billion in annual liquor sales take place during 
the holiday season, and that has many industry executives working overtime to 
capture some of the good cheer. In fact, many are already working on holiday 
campaigns for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But many liquor companies view the holiday marketing blitz as a costly 
tradition they would rather do without. And critics of liquor advertising say 
the industry is only taking advantage of the holiday to push more products. 
</P>
<P>
Liquor ads seek to "normalize drinking and make it a sexy, necessary part of 
everybody's life," said Karen Lieberman, project associate at the Center for 
Science in the Public Interest, a longtime critic of alcoholic beverage 
marketing. "The holidays are an increasingly used vehicle to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Still, liquor firms, which voluntarily refrain from advertising on television, 
flood magazines and billboards with eye-catching promotions and gimmicks. The 
December issue of LA Style, for example, weighs in with more than two dozen 
liquor ads, including a 3D ad for Tanqueray English gin, complete with special 
eyeglasses. 
</P>
<P>
In stores, distillers compete for prime supermarket space at the end of aisles. 
Animated displays and bottles boxed in fancy foil and tin boxes fight for 
customer attention. A Johnnie Walker Red Scotch display features a bag of 
spirits descending a chimney. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year they get very aggressive because it's the busiest time of the 
year," said marketing executive Al Marasca at Ralphs supermarkets, where liquor 
sales double in the period between Christmas Day and New Year's. 
</P>
<P>
Schieffelin &amp; Somerset Co., which distributes such brands as Johnnie Walker 
and Hennessy cognac, spends nearly 40% of its $60-million ad budget in November 
and December. "The sheer (sales) volume means heavy advertising during the two 
months," said Clint Rodenberg, marketing head at Schieffelin &amp; Somerset. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday liquor battle has intensified in recent years because liquor 
consumption has declined and consumers are turning to premium products, 
generally priced at $10 a bottle or more. Per-capita consumption has declined 
from a high of two gallons in 1978 to 1.54 gallons in 1988, according to the 
Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, an industry trade group. 
</P>
<P>
However, sales of certain categories of liquor, such as high-priced vodkas and 
cognacs, have continued to climb. "People are drinking very selectively," said 
Lynn Strang, council spokeswoman. "They are purchasing the high-end, premium 
products, and there has been a return to the cocktail and sophisticated drinks 
in recent years." 
</P>
<P>
The stakes are so high this time of year that no detail is too small. Packages, 
for example, are designed to glitter and shine under store lights. Kahlua, a 
coffee liqueur, includes two coffee cups in its holiday gift pack. 
</P>
<P>
"The real bump in the business is the bump that gift-giving provides, and 
that's why packaging is so important," said Rodenberg at Schieffelin &amp; 
Somerset. 
</P>
<P>
The holidays also see intensified competitions for choice ad spots in 
magazines, such as the page opposite the table of contents or near the cover 
story. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly want to be the first brand in the book if we can get it," 
Rodenberg said. "In a tough market, it can make a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
Not content with nearly monopolizing magazine ad space, some distillers have 
added some high-tech bells and whistles to their magazine promotions. Special 
issues of Rolling Stone and New York magazine this month will contain a 
hologram of a Finlandia vodka bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Carillon Importers, which is recognized for its expensive, high-tech holiday 
ads, this year inserted talking Absolut ads that wish readers a merry Christmas 
in several languages as well as a happy Hanukkah. 
</P>
<P>
Intense holiday competition is "why we try to get better and more spectacular 
advertising than other people," said Roux at Carillon. But, he added, "it's 
hard to measure how much more business you are going to get from something like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Such ads have also backfired. Carillon said that about 10% of 200,000 motorized 
ads for its Grand Marnier liqueur this year failed to operate as intended. The 
battery-powered ad, carried in the New Yorker magazine, resembles an oversized 
greeting card that contains a paper Grand Marnier bottle that swings back and 
forth. 
</P>
<P>
Many liquor companies try to avoid such costly ads and as much of the holiday 
marketing fray as they can. There is also a risk that a brand can become 
associated too closely with the holidays, limiting its popularity during the 
rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a heavy holiday product can literally be a kiss of death," said Dean 
Laws, president of Eisman Johns &amp; Laws, a Los Angeles advertising agency 
that includes Kahlua liqueur as a client. "It becomes so specialized in its 
orientation that it's difficult to build strength for the other 10 months of 
the year." 
</P>
<P>
Some liquor companies prefer to spread their marketing dollars more evenly 
around the year as distillers try to build brand loyalty, said Ralph Hallquist, 
marketing and advertising vice president at Jim Beam. 
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to build brand awareness," said Hallquist, "and it's awfully 
difficult to do that in a three-month spurt."

SHEARSON STILL FACES SOME TOUGH DECISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shearson Lehman Hutton has managed to maintain its credit ratings with plans 
for a $900-million capital infusion, but Wall Street's struggling No. 2 firm 
needs a lot more to reverse its fortunes after the difficulties of the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The investment giant announced last week that it plans to sell 20 million new 
shares of common stock, as well as blocks of new preferred stock and debt 
securities, to raise its capital by 17%, to about $6 billion. In reaction, 
Moody's, the credit rating agency, promptly announced that it wouldn't drop 
Shearson's credit rating, as it had threatened. 
</P>
<P>
But while the money is much needed, it won't instantly clear up Shearson's 
operating problems. The firm's profit margins are lower than those of most of 
its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts predict that Shearson's net profit margin for 1989 will be about 
1% for the second year in a row. By comparison, Salomon Bros.' margin is 
expected to be about 6%, Morgan Stanley's nearly 8% and Merrill Lynch's about 
2%. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the planned capital infusion, Shearson's credit rating is still lower 
than those of such key competitors as Merrill Lynch, First Boston, Salomon 
Bros. and Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., Moody's officials say. The lower rating 
means that the firm must pay more in interest when it wants to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
In its re-evaluation of Shearson, Moody's cited the company's exposure in the 
troubled real estate market. The company's Balcor subsidiary has commercial 
real estate loans valued at about $1 billion, said Christopher Mahoney, a 
Moody's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials have emphasized that the real estate portfolio is widely 
diversified, and thus less risky, and noted that it is only a small slice of 
Balcor's total assets of about $75 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say Shearson, like so many other firms on Wall Street, still 
appears to be over-staffed for the amount of business it can expect to generate 
in the markets' current sluggish state. Although Shearson has recently 
announced an 800-employee cutback, "to be in really good shape, they might need 
another 10% cut," said Perrin Long, an analyst with Lipper Analytical 
Securities in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Shearson's strengths include its huge retail brokerage arm. The 
productivity of its brokers in generating commissions is among the highest in 
the industry, said Lawrence Eckenfelder, an analyst with Prudential-Bache 
Securities in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The firm's money-management arm rates fairly high compared to the competition. 
Even though the financial results of the company's investment banking 
subsidiary were off 32% in the third quarter, "it has a strong franchise," 
Eckenfelder said. Among Shearson's weaker units are its overseas operations, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Shearson's financial results have been hurt by a variety of unrelated problems 
in the past year. Its Boston Co. unit was found to have overstated its income 
by $30 million. Shearson wrote off $100 million of its investment in MCorp., a 
troubled Texas financial concern. 
</P>
<P>
The company's efforts to strengthen its position in mergers and acquisitions 
have not lived up to expectations. And along with the rest of Wall Street, 
Shearson has suffered because of the general slowdown in the markets. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, for the first nine months of the year, Shearson's profits were $106 
million, down 3% from last year's $110 million. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Long asserts that Shearson, like others on Wall Street, may simply need 
to get out of some barely profitable businesses if it is to thrive during the 
tough times that may lie ahead. The industry as a whole is making very little 
money trading government bonds, for example, or in selling exchange-listed 
stocks to institutional customers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although many firms remain in these businesses because of a hope of future 
earnings, "eventually, they're going to have to recognize them for what they 
are," Long said.

EDISON'S CHAIRMAN SAYS HE MAY RETIRE NEXT YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
UTILITIES: IF A PROPOSED $2.4-BILLION MERGER WITH SAN DIEGO GAS &amp; ELECTRIC 
IS STILL PENDING WHEN HOWARD ALLEN TURNS 65 IN OCTOBER, THE BOARD MAY WANT HIM 
TO STAY ON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard P. Allen, the outspoken and colorful chairman of Southern California 
Edison Co. and its holding company, said he might leave once he reaches the 
utility's retirement age of 65 next October, but he added that he will wait 
until August to decide. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Allen also confirmed that he met earlier this month with each 
member of the state Public Utilities Commission to say he was thinking of 
retiring -- even though the company's controversial $2.4-billion proposed 
merger with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. will probably remain unresolved at 
the time of his departure. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that I should call on each commissioner and tell them that I would be 
at normal retirement age in October and that I would be making a decision in 
August on this," Allen said in the interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the merger suggested that Allen might want to remove himself from 
public scrutiny since his gruff style has been something of a lightning rod for 
critics in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Other observers said they doubt that Edison's board will let Allen -- the 
architect of Edison's aggressive diversification -- go easily, since he is also 
the moving force behind the merger. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he wants to retire, the 36-year Edison veteran sidestepped the 
question. "The board could conclude that it would be better if I stay on a year 
and wind this thing up in the interests of consumers and an orderly 
transition," he said. But he added, "I believe in normal retirement. A lot of 
mischief can be played by well-intentioned, good people who stay on too long." 
</P>
<P>
Likely candidates to succeed Allen include SCEcorp Executive Vice Presidents 
John E. Bryson and Michael R. Peevey. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to tell how things will sort out because (Allen) exerted such a 
strong hand in the company for a number of years," said Bud Moeller, a 
utilities analyst with Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, an energy-consulting firm in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Power, a former PUC administrative law judge and a lawyer specializing 
in utilities issues, said: "He's a hard act to follow. . . . But I don't see 
(Edison) losing direction. . . . If they stick to their business, they'll do 
just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Allen would leave behind an Edison career that climaxed with the company's 
aggressive moves into non-regulated businesses that helped it earn record 
profits in an increasingly competitive climate. 
</P>
<P>
Allen put together the plan to merge Edison with SDG&amp;E, a deal that would 
create the nation's largest supplier of electricity if it passes the lengthy 
federal and state regulatory process now under way.

The proposed merger, though it has been approved by the San Diego utility's 
board, has drawn heated opposition from local San Diego groups contending that 
a merger would mean less control, higher rates, fewer jobs and more pollution 
in their city. Edison denies the charges. Some critics have argued that Allen 
himself has been insensitive to the concerns of San Diegans -- a charge that 
Allen disputes. 
</P>
<P>
Would Allen's retirement mollify the merger's opponents? 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are some people here who would be glad to see him go, but I 
don't think it would lessen the opposition," said Bob Hudson, executive 
director of the broad-based Coalition for Local Control, a San Diego group 
opposing the merger. "It's not a personality issue; it's about air pollution, 
rates and local control." 
</P>
<P>
Allen, a native of Upland and a former Stanford Law School professor, joined 
Edison in 1954 as a lobbyist in Sacramento. He has been president of the 
company since 1980 and chairman and chief executive since 1984. He holds the 
same three titles with the parent company, SCEcorp. 
</P>
<P>
Under Allen's stewardship, Edison has managed to steer away from investments in 
troubled nuclear projects or savings and loans that have proven disastrous for 
other utility companies. Faced with federal and state regulations that require 
Edison to buy power from independent producers at rates set by regulators, 
Allen oversaw the creation of a power producer, Mission Energy, a separate 
subsidiary of SCEcorp, to sell power to Edison. 
</P>
<P>
Allen has been a vocal opponent of such regulations.

DURABLE GOODS ORDERS SURGE 5.1% FOR MONTH 
</P>

<P>
A surge in demand for aircraft and parts boosted orders for durable goods by a 
surprisingly strong 5.1% in November, the biggest gain this year, the Commerce 
Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Aircraft orders accounted for about 40% of the increase, but there were also 
smaller increases across several other broad categories of goods. 
</P>
<P>
However, because the figure is considered volatile and subject to significant 
revision, some money market economists said it would not necessarily discourage 
the Federal Reserve from pursuing a policy of easier credit. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a reported drop in the October order rate was revised from 1.3% 
to 0.7%. 
</P>
<P>
But other economists said the November report, showing gains not only in orders 
but also in shipments and backlogs, might ease some of the concerns about the 
weakness in the manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
Even excluding defense orders, durable goods orders were up 4.2% after a 0.1% 
increase in October. And orders for goods outside the transportation sector 
rose 3.1% in November after falling 1.7% in October, suggesting strength across 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
"This confirms our belief that the fourth-quarter weakness should be 
temporary," said David Wyss, chief economist with DRI/McGraw Hill Inc. in 
Lexington, Mass. "It should be bouncing back up in the first half." 
</P>
<P>
The overall 5.1% rise in durable goods, items built to last three years or 
more, was the largest monthly increase since a 7.4% gain in December, 1988, 
department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts had forecast that durable goods orders would be unchanged from October 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
"With a number as volatile as this, I can't think this will stop" the Fed from 
continuing on its course, said chief economist Alan Leslie at Discount Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"If this (strong durable goods) trend should continue, there is the question as 
to whether deceleration in manufacturing has bottomed out," said senior analyst 
Jan Neupauer at Chase Securities. "But one month's data is not something you 
want to hang your hat on." 
</P>
<P>
The Fed on Wednesday engineered a drop in the key federal funds rate to 8.25%, 
and the markets have been expecting the central bank to ease the rate to around 
8% early in the new year.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: THE DOS AND DON'TS OF ELECTRONIC TAX FILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christmas is about the worst time to think about filing tax returns. But soon 
the Internal Revenue Service will be mailing out those dreaded 1040s, this time 
with a new pitch: File electronically, and you'll get your refund much faster. 
</P>
<P>
Next year for the first time, taxpayers in all 50 states will be able to file 
tax returns electronically through computer linkups between authorized 
companies and the IRS. If you decide to use this service, however, be sure to 
shop around for the best deals; fees vary widely. And be wary of some deals 
that promise to get you your refund even faster through so-called refund 
anticipation loans. 
</P>
<P>
Electronic filing is not new, having been introduced in 1986 on an experimental 
basis in selected markets. Each year it has become available in more cities. 
Last year about 1.2 million returns were processed electronically through 
nearly 14,000 IRS-approved firms. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles area, however, it does not seem to have caught on yet. In 
this past year's filing season -- the first time electronic filing was 
available here -- only 5,500 taxpayers used the procedure, says Carole 
Levitzky, public affairs specialist at the IRS district office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS, which plans a big promotional push this season to encourage electronic 
filing, hopes usage will improve. It expects the number of returns filed 
electronically to nearly double in the upcoming tax season, to about 2 million. 
And in five years, some experts predict, the procedure will be used by as many 
as 30 million taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
"By the year 1995, electronic filing will be the normal, accepted means of 
filing your individual and business tax returns, and by 2000, the IRS will be 
98% paper-free," predicts David Green, managing partner of Alder, Green &amp; 
Hasson, a Los Angeles accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
There are two key advantages to electronic filing: 
</P>
<P>
* Quicker refunds. Electronic filers can get their refunds in three weeks, 
versus the normal six to 10 weeks for paper filers. If you have a direct 
deposit arrangement with a bank -- whereby the IRS can deposit your refund 
directly into your savings or checking account -- you can get your refund in as 
little as two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles area last year, the average refund on electronic returns 
totaled $1,487 -- a nice amount of change to get a month sooner. 
</P>
<P>
* Fewer errors. The IRS-approved software used to file electronically will 
identify math mistakes. The error rate on electronic returns is only 3%, versus 
16% for paper returns, the IRS says. 
</P>
<P>
How do you file electronically? 
</P>
<P>
You can't do it by yourself. Instead, you have to do it through a tax preparer, 
bank, computer firm or other outfit approved by the IRS; they vary from 
mom-and-pop street-corner CPA firms, to giant national chains like H&amp;R 
Block, to companies peddling tax-preparation software. If you do your own taxes 
on your personal computer using suitable tax-preparation software, you can take 
or send your diskette to some services. Some will file your return 
electronically if you fax your forms in. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles area, some 1,060 firms have been authorized to offer 
electronic filing for the upcoming season, up from about 660 in the 1989 
season, the IRS's Levitzky says. 
</P>
<P>
Call around, so you can also comparison shop for the best price and service. 
Fees can run as low as $5 to well over $50. 
</P>
<P>
Also, some electronic filing firms are offering to lend you the amount of your 
expected refund. Fees for these refund anticipation loans can easily run over 
$50. That can be equivalent to an annual interest rate of well over 100% -- 
just for getting the use of your money a few days early. Is that really worth 
it?

GUILTY PLEAS IN AEROSPACE FASTENER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Burbank company pleaded guilty Friday to five felony charges of selling 
substandard nuts and bolts used in the space shuttle and other aircraft, and it 
agreed to pay $625,000 in fines and restitution, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Engineering &amp; Supply Inc. entered its pleas in federal court in 
San Jose, where in February a federal grand jury had indicted the company on 33 
charges relating to fasteners -- mainly nuts and bolts -- that Lawrence sold 
primarily to the U.S. government from late 1983 through 1987. The other 28 
charges were dismissed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Lawrence pleaded guilty to "falsely certifying that aerospace 
fasteners it sold to the United States met all applicable government standards 
when, in fact, they did not," Joseph P. Russoniello, U.S. attorney for the 
Northern District of California, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence was one of several fastener producers that came under scrutiny in the 
past two years as part of a widespread federal investigation into sales of 
allegedly bogus aerospace parts. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment of Lawrence alleged that the company routinely fabricated the 
results of safety tests on counterfeit nuts and bolts, then sold the fasteners 
to government agencies and private companies for use on the space shuttle, the 
Army's Bradley fighting vehicle, Navy aircraft and United Airlines commercial 
jets, among other projects. 
</P>
<P>
Two Lawrence executives also were indicted: Gary R. Davidson of Saugus, who was 
Lawrence's quality control manager from 1978 until his departure in 1985, and 
Ramon Smith of Canyon Country, Lawrence's former vice president and general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson pleaded guilty to two felony charges in February and was fined 
$25,000, said Leo P. Cunningham, assistant U.S. attorney, in San Jose. Smith, 
who pleaded innocent, is scheduled to go to trial on Jan. 16. Smith's lawyer 
has said that Smith directed Lawrence's sales and relied on others for quality 
control and proper certifications of the fasteners in question. 
</P>
<P>
A federal investigation of Lawrence began in the summer of 1988 after the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration replaced more than 350 of 
Lawrence's bolts installed in the space shuttle Discovery before its successful 
launch in September, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
NASA had been alerted earlier by one of its subcontractors that some Lawrence 
bolts might not meet safety standards, and NASA then found that the bolts did 
not meet strength requirements. 
</P>
<P>
United Airlines also confirmed early this year that it had installed 1,000 of 
Lawrence's allegedly bogus bolts in some of its planes but said that passengers 
were not at risk because the systems using the bolts had backups in the event 
of failure.

COLUMBIA PICKS NEW AGENCY FOR TRI-STAR ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. said Friday that it pulled its Tri-Star 
Pictures domestic advertising account from the Los Angeles branch of AC&amp;R 
Advertising and gave it to McCann-Erickson Worldwide, which now places domestic 
advertising for the company's Columbia Pictures unit. 
</P>
<P>
The Tri-Star account, which involves media placement of the studio's movie ads, 
is estimated to have billings of between $70 million and $75 million and is 
believed to be among AC&amp;R Los Angeles' largest accounts, if not its 
largest. 
</P>
<P>
Its loss is a serious blow to AC&amp;R, a unit of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co., 
which has lost other entertainment accounts in the last few years, most notably 
NBC Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been going on for a long time, and I have no idea why they changed," said 
R. Lynn Livingston, president of AC&amp;R's Irvine office. 
</P>
<P>
For McCann, it means a total of $150 million in Columbia billings. McCann 
prevailed in an account review that included Grey Advertising and Backer 
Spielvogel Bates. McCann officials could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston said the change may have been prompted by the recent $3.4-billion 
buyout of Columbia Pictures Entertainment by Japan's Sony Corp. a month ago, 
but a Columbia spokesman who asked not to be identified said the decision was 
unrelated to the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
One industry insider, who asked not to be identified, suggested that Tri-Star 
may have been unhappy with AC&amp;R's media planning. Patrick King, who runs 
AC&amp;R's Los Angeles office, could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Among Tri-Star's recent films have been "Steel Magnolias" and "Look Who's 
Talking," while Columbia's recent films have included "When Harry Met Sally . . 
." and "Ghostbusters II."

<P>
Tennessee guard Dena Head scored 24 points, making 11 of 14 shots, to lead the 
No. 4-ranked Volunteers over USC, 87-55, in a women's basketball game Friday 
night at the Lyon Center. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee took an early lead, 18-8, but Kim Gessig scored four points in a 
rally that gave the Trojans a 25-23 edge with five minutes to go in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojan lead was short-lived as Tennessee took a 36-27 halftime advantage. 
Daedra Charles had four of her 13 points during Tennessee's 8-2 run to start 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Tammy Story led USC (2-2) with 18 points. Tennessee, which finished with 
a 2-2 record on its California trip, is 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame 61, UCLA 60 -- Notre Dame's Margaret Nowlin made two free throws 
with 18 seconds left to give the Fighting Irish a 61-57 lead at South Bend, 
Ind. The Bruins could only answer with Nicole Henderson's three-point shot at 
the buzzer in a game that had six lead changes. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame went on an 11-4 run for a 55-47 lead with 4:22 to play, only to see 
UCLA battle back to tie, 57-57, at 1:29.

'KINGFISH' ARRIVES WITH TEETH INTACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, TIMES THEATER CRITIC

<TEXT>
<P>
Down, Kingfish. Don't kill the critics. There's a good boy. 
</P>
<P>
We are discussing Marlane Meyer's "Kingfish," a comedy of perception. First 
seen at the Los Angeles Theatre Center two seasons ago, it arrived Thursday 
night at Joseph Papp's Public Group Theater, to negative reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"Self-conscious absurdism," said the New York Times. "An old dog trying to 
learn new tricks," said Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
Nonsense. "Kingfish" is a wonderful play. Unless, of course, it merely 
coincides with this reviewer's private obsessions. How would the world look if 
we could get above ourselves? 
</P>
<P>
The very question of the play. It is Meyer's opinion that in the world of the 
human mind, there is very little there. Things are what we agree to call them 
and we make some bizarre agreements, from which real-world consequences flow, 
and sometimes blood as well. 
</P>
<P>
Rather a timely point for a play to make as the truths of the Cold War get 
revised. "Kingfish" is not, however, a preachment. It's a shaggy-dog story, or 
rather a shaggy-box story. 
</P>
<P>
Again Buck Henry plays, to fussy perfection, a lonely bachelor whose best 
friend in the whole world is a Doberman named Kingfish. All that we see is a 
black box about the size of a television set with a green slash on one end for 
teeth, but to Henry it's a true killer-dog, and the play demonstrates how such 
a fiction can become a fact when it is to the interest of enough people to buy 
into it. 
</P>
<P>
"Harvey" made the same point in another way, and, "Kingfish" offers some of the 
same theatrical fun, updated to the style of the 1980s, for those not so on 
their high horse that they can't see it. Baleful as it sounds, the play is a 
comedy, a point not forgotten by David Schweizer's cast, including David 
Schweizer. 
</P>
<P>
Once more he perches above the black-box set on a light bridge, reading aloud 
the stage directions while a colleague, Arthur Hanket, throws Kingfish his 
barks and growls. 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" somebody wanted to know at intermission. Because it works. Also, I 
imagine, to stress the idea that "Kingfish" is a story about the boxes that 
people perform their lives in. What's on-the-nose about this off-the-wall story 
is the sense that its characters, like Chekhov characters, are stuck in 
separate mental compartments, although nominally sharing the same plot. They 
seem to have signed a mutual nonaggression pact: I won't test your reality if 
you don't test mine. 
</P>
<P>
When someone does test someone else's reality -- when it is suggested that 
perhaps Kingfish is only a barking box -- someone has to pay for his 
impertinence. Truth in "Kingfish" is a punishable offense. 
</P>
<P>
Abstract as it may sound, Meyer's characters do live in their version of the 
real world. Jacque Lynn Colton is again the randy practical nurse. Tony 
Abatemarco is the dog trainer (real dogs). Barry Sherman is the hustler -- less 
eerie than the late Merritt Buttrick at LATC, but just as hysterical. Kevin 
O'Rourke is the CIA agent -- Ollie North, where Sam Anderson gave us John Wayne 
at LATC. 
</P>
<P>
Henry takes the last two men to live with him, as his "sons." (Another 
lietmotif of the play is "family.") Will the boys inherit his money, or will 
Colton and Abatemarco, or will Kingfish? Or will he die at all? The situation 
is clear-cut and the ending not to be taken literally. But we get the message. 
Ideas in this play don't just have legs. They have teeth.

MOVIES: THE ACTOR WHO GIVES VOICE TO SEBASTIAN THE CRAB IN 'THE LITTLE MERMAID'

It is lunchtime at Soudani's, the most fashionable eatery in this Upstate 
village, the home town of actor Samuel E. Wright. The actor delivered an 
indelible performance in one of the country's hottest movies, and yet, not a 
head turns when Wright enters the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The oversight is forgivable, given the lack of physical similarity between 
Wright and his on-screen role. Wright is a tall, spindly black man. His 
character is 4 inches high and lobster red. Wright is also stabbing at a plate 
of sole, a sight that would give his squeamish on-screen character an 
underwater fit. 
</P>
<P>
Wright is the voice behind Sebastian, the tiny crab courtier to the sea king 
Triton in Disney's "The Little Mermaid." In a movie literally swimming with 
memorable characters, Sebastian steals the show. 
</P>
<P>
Over that sole-ful lunch, Wright slips easily into character, his voice 
softening into a familiar Caribbean lilt, and he becomes Sebastian, down to the 
tiniest degree. And close inspection reveals that, yes, there may even be a 
faint physical resemblance there, after all. He has Sebastian's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"You see these bags?" the actor asks, leaning and running a finger beneath each 
of huge, slightly bug eyes. "They're on Sebastian, too." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of broad public recognition is, at best, a mixed blessing for any 
actor. But for Wright, it is a circumstance he has learned to live with. Before 
playing Sebastian, the actor's broadest exposure in a 20-year career came as 
the bunch of grapes in the Fruit of the Loom underwear commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Wright has had serious roles as well, occasionally even playing 
humans. Before "The Little Mermaid," his most recent film work was as jazz 
great Dizzy Gillespie in Clint Eastwood's little-seen "Bird." He earned a Tony 
nomination for his performance as the stern father in "The Tap Dance Kid." 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that his was a serendipitous career, Wright couldn't guess what 
might result when he was asked three years ago to prepare a clever little 
calypso number called "Under the Sea" for an audition. A cruise ship cabaret, 
perhaps? The songwriting team of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, the creators of 
the stage version of "The Little Shop of Horrors," were in New York after 
vainly scouring Hollywood for actors to voice the roles of Sebastian, a crab 
with no appetite for seafood-loving humans, and the mermaid heroine Ariel. 
</P>
<P>
They set up shop at 42nd Street and 8th Avenue, in the seedy neighborhood 
around the Port Authority bus terminal. Wright thought it an unlikely address 
for any project of real promise, but he was in a gambling mood. Instead of 
giving them just his voice, he auditioned as if trying for the lead in a 
Broadway musical, bouncing across the room, fingers snapping, arms waving. 
</P>
<P>
"Howard's eyes are like saucers," Wright says. "But I wondered, 'What happened, 
did I do the wrong thing?' " 
</P>
<P>
Ashman and Menken didn't think so. They sent Wright's audio tapes to director 
Ron Clements back at the Disney studios, and they had their crab. 
</P>
<P>
"Sam was good on the dialogue, but he was great on the song," Clements said. 
"Some voices are an inspiration. You can close your eyes and see the 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
But even Clements was delighted beyond all expectation when he actually saw 
Wright perform "Under the Sea" in the Disney studio. "We videotaped that whole 
session," Clements says. "We showed it to the entire staff for inspiration 
because it was so much fun to look at." 
</P>
<P>
The song, a steel-band paean to the virtues of life in the deep, gets airplay 
on at least one FM rock station in New York. In it, Sebastian reminds Ariel, 
who longs to be human, what she would leave behind: 
</P>
<P>
 We got a hot crustacean band . . . 
</P>
<P>
 each little clam here know how to jam here . . . 
</P>
<P>
 each little snail here know how to wail here . . . 
</P>
<P>
 under the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 That song and Sebastian's other number, "Kiss the Girl," a serenade sung to 
Ariel and her handsome prince, were recorded first. Sebastian's dialogue proved 
more problematic for Wright, who was unaccustomed to acting alone in an empty 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't feel right somehow. I'm 6-foot-3 and Sebastian is all of 4 inches, 
and it just wasn't coming across," says Wright. "I couldn't act the role. I was 
talking into a microphone like I was doing a commercial." 
</P>
<P>
So Wright improvised, asking that the mike be moved up and away from him, 
forcing him to talk up, to strain a bit to be heard. "So everything I say is 
like Sebastian would be saying it -- just out of earshot, trying to get 
attention." Call it Underwater Method acting. 
</P>
<P>
Voice acting, Wright found, is in some regard even tougher than other acting 
because a player not only has to create his character, but his character's 
environment, as well. 
</P>
<P>
"When I looked at the little mermaid, I just didn't see a shadowy face floating 
in front of mine," Wright says. "There was an actual three-dimensional thing 
that moved in space. I could see her fins, I knew exactly what relation they 
were to her body." 
</P>
<P>
On dry land, Wright leads a standard sort of life in this village, 75 miles 
into the cold of the Hudson River Valley. He lives with his wife and three 
children in a Victorian home done up for Christmas in evergreen garlands and 
big red bows. It is testament to his skills, and those of Disney's animators, 
that Sebastian's alter-ego seems almost out of place in so conventional a 
setting. 
</P>
<P>
Almost like a crab out of water.

STAGE WIRE: UNEMPLOYMENT, LOW PAY STILL A BIG PART OF THE ACTOR'S LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So you want to be an actor? Go for it. But first take a look at the statistics 
in the current issue of the Actors' Equity newsletter, Equity News. 
</P>
<P>
"EMPLOYMENT CONTINUES STRONG UPSWING" is the headline. That sounds hopeful, and 
the figures do show that members worked a total of 233,540 weeks during the 
1988-89 theater season -- the highest in the union's history. 
</P>
<P>
They also show that: 
</P>
<P>
* Only 38% of the union's 36,481 members worked at all during the year. Twenty 
years ago, when Equity had only $14,504 members, 69% of them found at least one 
job during the season. 
</P>
<P>
* They worked only an average of 17 weeks. (A little better than the 1968-69 
figure: 16.2 weeks.) 
</P>
<P>
* Their average annual salary was only $9,858. (In 1968-69, it was $3,699.) 
</P>
<P>
For comparison, the U.S. government pegs the poverty level for individuals at 
$5,778 -- for families at $11,611. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to act, learn to type. 
</P>
<P>
EBENEEZER, THOU HAST CONQUERED. As usual, "A Christmas Carol" wins the holiday 
play derby. American Theatre magazine's December issue lists 25 resident 
theater productions of Dickens' story from Maine to California, either in the 
original or in an update such as Ed Graczyk's "A Country Christmas Carol" (the 
Players Theater, Columbus, Ohio). 
</P>
<P>
Way back in the pack come O'Henry's "Gift of the Magi," Dylan Thomas' "A 
Child's Christmas in Wales," Truman Capote's "A Christmas Memory" and Thornton 
Wilder's "The Long Christmas Dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Fairy tales turn up in Milwaukee ("The Snow Queen," Milwaukee Repertory 
Theatre) and Minneapolis ("Cinderella," Minnesota Children's Theatre). Chapel 
Hill, N.C., will see a non-musical version of "The Nutcracker" (PlayMakers 
Repertory Company). San Francisco's Eureka Theatre will do "Little Nemo in 
Slumberland," based on the old Little Nemo comic strip. 
</P>
<P>
A few theaters will also remember whose birthday it is. El Teatro Campesino's 
production of "La Pastorela" at San Juan Bautista shows the Holy Family trying 
to find lodgings. Romulus Linney's "Sand Mountain" (Attic Theatre, Detroit) 
shows Jesus returning to Earth to share a jug with a mountain family. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Indiana Repertory Theatre is offering something called "Christmas 
With Bernadette." Hm. 
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D.-Vermont) on the recent National Endowment for 
the Arts controversy: "The issue that nobody wants to talk about is that some 
day, if you vote to protect the NEA, somebody is going to run that 30-second 
spot and say: 'Sen. So-and-So supports pornography.' "

MOVABLE FEASTS: PRIMI -- PASTA TO GO FOR LAST-MINUTE PACKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.N. HALLIBURTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So here we are again. Frankincense, myrrh and traffic jams: the perfect season 
for curling up at home and taking out. How nice to find that Primi, that little 
dream of a restaurant designed by Pierro Selvaggio, also owner of Valentino, 
now has meals to-go. 
</P>
<P>
Primi's menu, as you might know, is heavily weighted towards primi piatti -- 
salads, soups, antipasti, succulent first-course things. There are pastas, 
risotti and a handful of piatti grandi, serious proteins, as well. 
</P>
<P>
The odds of experiencing high pleasure are very good here. Primi comes through 
most consistently -- all the way from the delicate rice potato and spinach soup 
to a smashing gossamer-berried creme brulee -- with subtlety. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I'm not going to say everything is perfect. The corn, barley and white 
Tuscan bean soup ($6) is neutral. And the best thing about the snails, polenta 
and fried parsley with a Cabernet sauce, which I found non-existent, is the 
parsley (the dish is $10). Another quibble: the very fresh soft pneumatic white 
rolls tucked in for dinner were absent at lunch. Still, this is a menu I'd 
happily work my way through anytime. 
</P>
<P>
To begin, piatto rustico ($8), is a fine assemblage of plump red and yellow 
peppers; stout-hearted marinated Tuscan white beans; really meaty, 
diamond-dense anchovies; moist Calamata olives; hunks of fine Parmigiano. One 
caveat: the little mound of caponata laced with mint, parsley and pine nuts is 
so honey-sweet it might have been doused with mead. 
</P>
<P>
Orange-cured salmon ($8) looks like an exotic sea flower, something you'd see 
during station breaks on KCET. Parchment-thin slices of roasted eggplant and 
zucchini are wrapped around generous curls of orange peel-flecked fish. 
Unfortunately, the salmon was so fat-streaked it resembled a piece of 
seersucker. 
</P>
<P>
Caesar salad ($7 for a large individual portion, $12 for the grand size) comes 
pungently dressed. If you're planning not to eat right away, ask for the 
dressing in a separate container. The house salad ($7) is an affable upscale 
mix of radicchio, arugula, romaine and endive, which once came overloaded with 
an overly oily dressing. 
</P>
<P>
The dishes one step up on the hearty scale are all wonderfully done. Sonoma 
lamb, Parmigiano and walnut salad ($11) is a fine mix of clear, strong tastes 
punctuated with a good vinaigrette. Bracioline of veal ($16) -- three skewers 
of lemony tender veal threaded with pancetta -- is beautifully executed. Its 
moist whole sage leaves and cubes of polenta soak up the reduced veal juices -- 
it's as earthy and delicious as anything I've had all year. 
</P>
<P>
Chicken and artichokes ($16) is a savory pleasure, with small morsels of 
peppery chicken and a slip of a woodsy rosemary vinegar. Ragout of calamari 
($14) is more ferocious and peppery, its soft tender rings strewn with capers 
and Calamata olives (not for the salt-shy). 
</P>
<P>
Among the pastas, there's a delicious linguine with clams ($11), all garlic- 
and sea-infused. I found the vegetable ravioli ($10) less pleasing. Gnocchi 
($10), which I don't think travels too well, is sweet and very plain. The dish 
is supposed to be made with a sausage infusion, though I found no sign of it -- 
in fact there wasn't much sauce at all. There were, however, good slivers of 
porcini mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the desserts is the aforementioned creme brulee with raspberries. 
Others don't hold up so well as take-out fare. The "chocolate chocolate" pastry 
purse, for example, turned soggy on the drive home. But the fruit and cheese 
plate ($7) -- the first I've encountered in my take-out rounds -- is a rich 
array of succulent goat and Italian cheeses and the ripest fruit. It's the 
perfect way to end your feast. 
</P>
<P>
 Primi, 10543 W. Pico Blvd., West Los Angeles.; (213) 475-9235. Take-out 
available seven days. Street parking. All major credit cards accepted.

A SECOND CAST OF PRINCIPALS IN 'NUTCRACKER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A second cast of principals showed elegance and polish in the Joffrey Ballet 
"Nutcracker" Thursday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Jodie Gates danced the role of the Sugar Plum Fairy with gorgeous refinement 
and placement and filled out phrases with regal authority and a deep inner 
stillness. For all that, she appeared less aloof and seemed to relate more 
warmly to other figures than she had last week at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center in Costa Mesa. Again, she danced her variation with light but plush 
pointe work. 
</P>
<P>
Tyler Walters as the Nutcracker Prince danced with more technical security than 
he had shown last week in Costa Mesa. His turns in the air Thursday were 
unblemished and his landings cleaner. He remained a considerate partner. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Corry made an eager, good-natured Fritz and fortunately did not tower over 
all the children, although pairing him with the shortest boy in a sword fight 
in the party scene drew undue attention to the blatant differences in their 
ages. 
</P>
<P>
As the Snow Prince, Corry danced with obvious enjoyment but had to work at 
sustaining momentum in the speedy virtuosic challenges. He was best in the 
series of skimming jack-knife jumps across the stage. 
</P>
<P>
As the Snow Queen and Snow King, Charlene Gehm and Daniel Baudendistel combined 
authority and warmth. 
</P>
<P>
In Act I, Carole Valleskey was a sly, deadpan Columbine and Pascal Benichou was 
an earnest Harlequin in their courting duet. 
</P>
<P>
In the divertissement, Valerie Madonia and Peter Narbutas were the archly 
languid Arabians. Johanna Snyder, Brent Phillips, Jacob Rice and Alexander 
Brady were the energetic Russians. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Grant and Mary Barton again were Drosselmeyer and Clara. Joseph 
Schnell was the Nutcracker Doll. 
</P>
<P>
John Miner conducted with a penchant for speed but also with sympathetic 
lyricism in sections such as the Snow Scene. CHRIS PASLES

PLAYWRIGHT FEASTS ON THE UNDERBELLY OF CORPORATE LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: THE AUTHOR OF 'THE DOWNSIDE' DRAWS HIS COMEDY FROM EFFORTS TO HIDE 
SAVAGE, PRIMITIVE MOTIVATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In person, Richard Dresser hardly seems the sort of fellow who would put the 
screws to you. Meeting his guest in the pool patio at a Santa Monica hotel, he 
makes sure that everyone has had coffee and that no one has to sit in the 
blazing sun. His manner is uncalculated, full of a satisfied working man's 
casual charm. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there's a devil inside Dresser, which he reserves for the hours he's 
writing plays. Then, he puts the nice guy on hold, bringing out every torture 
device known to the topical comedy writer and applying it to his characters. 
For the Boston Globe's Kevin Kelly, Dresser "is a ferocious playwright . . . 
(who) writes with a headlong intensity and a sense of pervasive mystery." 
</P>
<P>
His characters in "The Downside," currently receiving its West Coast premiere 
at the Pasadena Playhouse, get hurt tumbling through the corporate hellhole. 
</P>
<P>
Other Dresser characters seem to be in hell, like the fellow tuning in to UFO 
radio signals in "Better Days," or the lumpen proletariat couple living in the 
shadow of a nightmarish amusement park in "Splitsville." Even when his people 
can afford a holiday in the Hamptons ("Alone at the Beach"), they get in 
serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter, really, that the office in 'The Downside' is swanky and 
slick," the 38-year-old New York-based playwright said. "Ultimately, the 
comfortable exterior doesn't hide what I'm interested in, which is primitive 
motivations. We're never far away from them, and we go to great lengths to hide 
them -- this is where the comedy comes from." 
</P>
<P>
Things get fairly savage in the marketing offices of Mark &amp; Maxwell, a 
pharmaceutical company preparing a "product launch" of a new anti-stress drug 
known as Maxolan-3000. It looks like a winner; a "downside" is the time-line 
for the launch -- an impossible four-week free-fire zone of teleconferences, 
data surveys and strategy sessions. Another is the drug itself, which may have 
serious side effects. 
</P>
<P>
"We all find ourselves in impossible situations we're sure we won't survive," 
Dresser noted. "But the original impulse for writing this wasn't to see how a 
group of people handled extreme pressure, what kind of laughs I could get out 
of that. It was to observe how we do business in this country right now." 
</P>
<P>
He observed that it's easy to lose the impulse setting a play in motion, 
because the often-rough course from filling an empty piece of paper to getting 
the play to work on stage can lead the mind astray. 
</P>
<P>
With "The Downside," this was less a problem than usual, since the ways of 
American business are something Dresser has experienced closer to the bone, 
perhaps, than many playwrights. In the early '80s, before major regional 
productions, grants and awards came his way, he free-lanced as a speechwriter 
for corporate executives and a writer of industrial films -- often for 
pharmaceutical firms. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw how they operated, up close, and I didn't like what I saw," he recalled. 
"They eat each other alive. Just as bad is this absurd split that exists for 
the employee between the urge to work for The Team and the urge to cover your 
rear end. Dave (head of Mark &amp; Maxwell's marketing division) is where he is 
because he's been able to reconcile these two seemingly opposite needs. Alan 
(Dave's underling) can't, and tests Maxolan-3000 on himself as a moral 
decision. Dave's, unlike Alan's, is an unexamined life." 
</P>
<P>
Dresser asserts that he's also tweaking the movie business, from the witless, 
fast-lane film maker recording the product launch for the bosses upstairs, to 
the whole process of ladder-climbing savagery and non-productivity. The author 
knows this world, too: He's writing an ABC TV movie, a segment for the HBO 
anthology "Out of the Sixties" (he also did one of the "Vietnam War Stories" 
for HBO) and even two screenplays, which won praise at, of all places, the 
Eugene O'Neill National Playwrights Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The bright spot in his Hollywood adventures, he admitted, was "when I fell 
under the demonic spell of (TV producer) Jay Tarses and started writing, then 
story editing, for 'The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd.' He also has 
(playwrights) Eric Overmyer and Albert Innaurato, so it's like Off-Broadway on 
TV." 
</P>
<P>
But since marketing runs show business, "I wanted to do 'The Downside' here in 
L.A. In the end, the marketing people don't really make anything. They take 
meetings -- and get ahead. But no one in this play is a villain. The villain is 
the system. The question is, are you going to be a part of the system? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to tell anyone what my moral perspective on the play is," he 
smiled, just as he wasn't comfortable pointing out his writing influences. 
"I've got one, but the whole point of being part of a theater audience is 
finding that point of view for yourself. My first obligation is to entertain: 
to engage the audience." 
</P>
<P>
That may be Dresser's first obligation, but his primary drive seems to be to 
get plays out before an audience. His prolific output the past two years -- 
three full-length works and three one-acts -- is fairly amazing, considering 
the slug-like pace of American play production. 
</P>
<P>
"I write fast, but after I got the juices going, I wrote 'The Downside' in a 
frenzy -- about a month" -- roughly the same time given the Maxolan marketing 
team. It was first produced in 1987 at New Haven's Long Wharf Theatre by 
director Kenneth Frankel, who is restaging it here. 
</P>
<P>
"This sudden rush (of visibility) is pretty deceptive though," Dresser added. 
"I wrote 'Better Days' five years ago. Now it's getting all this attention by 
regional theaters and, now, New York. So it's frustrating, but hopeful 
playwrights can't let that bother them. It's hard to develop as a playwright if 
you don't finish writing the thing. Then you can find your voice." 
</P>
<P>
But, like a man proud but still puzzled by his trade, Dresser grinned as he 
confessed: "To actually sit down and decide that you're going to write a play 
isn't the most rational decision in the world."

WEEKEND CHECKLIST FOR DIGGERS, PLANTERS : GARDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen: 
</P>
<P>
* To keep weeds in check during the winter rains and give a neat appearance to 
your flower beds, weed now and apply a layer of mulch. 
</P>
<P>
* If you have hard-packed soil, including clay, be sure to apply gypsum or 
other additives to the yard in order to break the barriers to water 
penetration. 
</P>
<P>
* Did you spray your peaches and nectarines to prevent peach leaf curl yet? If 
not, do so immediately and then follow it up with another spraying before the 
buds swell. 
</P>
<P>
* Leave your poinsettias in the pot after the blossoms have gone and put them 
outside in a protected area, watering them occasionally. Plant them in the 
ground only after all chance of frost is gone.

TIPS, TOOLS TO HELP OLDER GARDENING ENTHUSIASTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE BRIA, ASSOCIATED PRESS: Bria retired from the Associated Press in 
1981 after 40 years that included coverage of World War II from Italy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Even the simplest gardening tasks -- like sowing seeds -- may become formidable 
as you grow old. But help is available, from special tools to expert advice, to 
keep your thumb green. 
</P>
<P>
Many gardeners devise their own ways to cope with, or avoid, the pain of 
pushing, pulling, handling, stooping, squatting and kneeling. 
</P>
<P>
As digital dexterity waned, I found tweezers indispensable to pick up tiny 
seeds and plant them just where I want them. And at least one company (Harris 
Seeds of Rochester, N.Y.) markets pelleted seeds encased in a white coating 
that makes them easier to see as well as handle. 
</P>
<P>
Some devices are expensive, but others require only ingenuity and make-do 
materials. For instance, you can stack three old tires and fill the hole in the 
middle with soil to make a planter just high enough for easy tending from a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
Gardening indoors under fluorescent lights gives you many of the benefits and 
few of the inconveniences, or the expense, of a greenhouse. You can start with 
a small two-tube unit and go as far as you want. Fluorescent stands of all 
sizes are available at garden centers and hardware stores, or you can make your 
own. My wife and I share a custom-made one along a wall of our dining room. She 
does flowers and I grow salad greens in the winter and start plants for summer. 
</P>
<P>
Raised-bed and container gardening also make chores easier. Craig Hospital of 
Englewood, Colo., has put out a booklet on raised-bed techniques, which, as the 
name implies, essentially involve planting above ground level. 
</P>
<P>
A similar pamphlet was published by the Horticulture Department of Virginia 
Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Va. And the American Horticultural Therapy 
Assn. of Gaithersburg, Md., is a fruitful source of information for many 
aspects of gardening for the handicapped and elderly.A few years ago, the 
National Gardening Assn., of Burlington, Vt., put out a booklet called "Tools 
and Techniques for Easier Gardening." This is unfortunately out of print, but 
may still be available through libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Divided into sections on soil preparation, planting, weeding, cultivating, 
watering and harvesting, it lists scores of special tools and companies that 
market them. It also abounds with homespun suggestions from many sources. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Ashworth of Heuvelton, N.Y., for example, said a chair with boards 
attached to the legs so it wouldn't sink into the ground enabled her mother to 
hoe while sitting and thus continue gardening much longer than she expected. 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Patterson of San Francisco suggested using barbecue tongs to pull 
weeds, transplant small plants or remove dead leaves from hard-to-reach areas. 
</P>
<P>
You can buy kneeling pads, make your own from a piece of foam rubber, or just 
use old cushions. Lightweight combination kneeler-sitters are available, easy 
to reverse and to grab onto to lower and lift yourself. Grips attached to the 
handles of shovels, hoes, spading forks or rakes reduce bending or arm strain. 
Hoes turned upside down become canes. 
</P>
<P>
Indoors, there are planter pulleys enabling you to lower and lift hanging 
plants and lock them into any position for watering or other tasks. 
</P>
<P>
If you regularly turn the soil of your vegetable garden, power tillers as light 
as 17 pounds make the chore easier. They come with various attachments, 
including lawn thatchers. But keeping a garden fertile by mulching with leaves, 
grass clippings and other composting material eliminates much toil involving 
heavy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Perennials also may reduce the volume of work, especially in decorative 
gardening, but a couple of vegetables also come in this class. Asparagus beds 
may last 50 years and more; rhubarb also repeats year after year with 
practically no care. My modest asparagus patch, 20 years old, provided more 
than 700 spears this year in a harvest period lasting two months. All I do is 
lay down a mulch of salt hay to keep down weeds and fertilize once a year. 
</P>
<P>
Among plants that need sowing annually, squashes offer long-lasting harvests, 
as do broccoli, pole beans and tomatoes of indeterminate varieties. Some 
lettuces are cut-and-come-again types. Ditto for New Zealand spinach and Swiss 
chard. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest help and encouragement for gardeners comes from the plants 
themselves. They want to live and grow. And they don't care whether you use 
tweezers to plant seeds or featherweight hoes to zap weeds.

MOORTEN'S BOTANICAL GARDENS PRESERVES THE TRUE PALM SPRINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHERI RAE, Rae is the author of the recently published East Mojave Desert: A 
Visitors Guide (Olympus Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Turn-of-the-century health-seekers and nature lovers recognized Palm Springs 
for what it was -- a true oasis. Here was a palm-dotted retreat where an 
ancient hot springs gushed forth. Here was nature, simple and unadorned. 
</P>
<P>
But today, the old Palm Springs is a little hard to find. As the demand for 
more golf courses and more luxury housing increases, the last vestiges of wild 
Palm Springs are all the more precious. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, there are people and places committed to the preservation of the 
last of the wild desert. Patricia Moorten, who owns and operates Moorten's 
Botanical Garden, believes the purpose of her garden is nothing less than the 
preservation and protection of our endangered native desert flora. "The idea 
behind Moorten's Garden is to give visitors, after they've been downtown, the 
feeling that they're out in the desert again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The garden is on Palm Canyon Drive just a few blocks from high-fashion salons 
and tacky T-shirt shops, but it is a world apart. The wood-burned plaque at the 
entrance reads: "This garden fosters the spirit of the desert despite the 
advent of man's possessive encroachment therein." 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the wooden fence, overgrown cacti facing the street and the 
funky hand-lettered signs suggest a tourist attraction from the 1930s -- kitsch 
instead of glitz. But once inside, the visitor is amazed by the extent of the 
cactus collections. And even though you swore you were going to concentrate on 
nothing but fun and sun in Palm Springs, you end up effortlessly learning an 
amazing amount of natural history and desert lore. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to the garden is an introduction not only to the Palm Springs of the 
past but also to the botanical diversity found in the deserts of the world. The 
self-guided tour takes the visitor through the environments of the Sonoran, 
Colorado, Chihuahuan, Mojave, African and South American deserts. 
</P>
<P>
Moorten's was opened more than a half-century ago by Chester "Cactus Slim" 
Moorten and his bride, Patricia. Slim was a Hollywood actor-turned-desert 
landscaper who developed a reputation for locating and transplanting exotic 
cactus species during the worldwide cactus craze in the early '50s. 
</P>
<P>
The garden very much reflects the personality of Patricia Moorten, a well-read 
botanist who, after more than 50 years of work, still consults with cactus 
lovers the world over. Dressed smartly and always wearing a large sun hat, 
Moorten frequently inspects her garden paths. She runs the place with the help 
of son Clark and grandson Richard. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so glad to share our garden with visitors," she says. "The fact that 
it's three generations of us now working here makes it very special." 
</P>
<P>
Moorten's is a great place to commune with cacti. More than 3,000 species can 
be found here, among them enormous century plants, spectacular 15-foot giant 
saguaros and a 20-foot cardon from Baja. Several hundred full-size species of 
cacti and succulents flourish in the cactarium, a temperature-regulated 
hothouse. 
</P>
<P>
One special attraction is an S-shaped palm tree that was moved here years ago 
from the open desert. The move was not an easy one, and a giant crane was 
required. The tree had been hit by lightning, which burned and bent it; still, 
it survived. 
</P>
<P>
"To me this palm is an example of that Bible passage that talks about how we 
grow from the heart out," Moorten says. 
</P>
<P>
The palm is the focal point of the garden's Little Tahquitz Falls area, which 
is a reproduction of the actual Tahquitz Canyon area just a few miles away. 
It's a romantic place, judging from the number of weddings and receptions that 
take place here. 
</P>
<P>
Children are drawn to "Tortoise Terrace," where desert tortoises lumber about 
and bask in the sun. And they seem to have a great time following the "Dinosaur 
Footprints" in the Prehistoric Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Home gardeners can browse in the garden's nursery and buy succulents and cacti 
of all sizes from deserts near and far. 
</P>
<P>
Moorten's philosophy about preserving the desert extends far beyond the walls 
of her garden. She frequently hosts gatherings of like-minded civic and 
conservation groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Palm Springs is still a very unique and romantic place," Moorten says, "but 
the city, for some reason, has always felt compelled to promote pseudo-glamour 
instead of the magnificent geographical setting." 
</P>
<P>
For five decades, Patricia Moorten has been a voice in the Palm Springs 
wilderness. She was one of the first botanists to preach the gospel of 
xeriscaping -- drought-resistant landscaping. As a city parks commissioner, she 
fought for desert landscaping instead of lawns and insisted that the palms not 
be pruned. To this day, when she learns of an imminent development, she makes 
it a point to beat the bulldozers to the construction site and "liberate" the 
native plants. 
</P>
<P>
"A little patch of green doesn't hurt, but the greatest percentage should be 
desert, open and natural," Moorten says. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly Moorten and other Palm Springs preservationists lost more battles than 
they won. They have seen the land and the names on the land change to an 
astonishing degree -- Rio del Sol is now Bob Hope Drive, Wonder Palms Road is 
Frank Sinatra Drive. 
</P>
<P>
To Patricia Moorten, and to visitors who step off the commercial path, 
Moorten's Botanical Garden is a place that celebrates the diversity of desert 
life and is living proof that the desert is anything but a barren wasteland. 
"The desert is far from deserted. It's full of fascinating creatures, 
especially plants. In fact, I feel like the desert is in tune with the 
universe." 
</P>
<P>
Moorten's Botanical Garden is at 1701 S. Palm Canyon Drive, Palm Springs, (619) 
327-6555. It's open Monday through Saturday, 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.; Sundays, 10 
a.m. to 4 p.m. Adults $1.50; children 50 cents; age 5 and under, free.

BOB GREENE: MYSTERY LEFT UNSOLVED BY FALL OF WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All the politicians and pundits have offered their analyses about the crumbling 
of the Berlin Wall and what it means to world events. Every time I see a 
picture of the Wall, though, all I can think about is Sarah Pryor. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 9, 1985, Sarah Pryor, 9, who lived in Wayland, Mass., told her father 
she was going to go out for a walk in the neighborhood. It was 4 p.m. Wayland 
is a quiet, usually peaceful town of 15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah had just finished eating a dish of Jell-O that she had made for herself. 
She watched a TV show, and that's when she told her dad she was going to go 
out. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Aren't you going to clean the dish of Jell-O?' " recalls her father, 
Andrew Pryor. "She said she'd clean it when she got back. She walked out the 
front door. I never saw her again." 
</P>
<P>
According to Wayland Police officers, Sarah walked north on Concord Road for 
approximately 1 1/2 miles. Several people saw her as she walked. Then she 
disappeared. According to police, "We don't know exactly where. It is our 
belief that she was abducted. But we have no crime scene, no witnesses and no 
physical evidence. We do not know what happened to this child." 
</P>
<P>
Sarah was described as "your basic, average, happy-go-lucky, 9-year-old girl. 
She was shy around strangers. She was very much family-oriented and very 
athletic. She did well in school." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, almost two years after Sarah Pryor disappeared, an American journalist 
named Martin Yant was traveling in Germany, and he made a point of visiting the 
Berlin Wall. There was graffiti on the Western side of the Wall, which 
surprised Yant: Somehow it had never occurred to him that there would be 
graffiti on the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
As he looked at the Wall, Yant saw something that startled him. Amid all the 
drawings and scrawlings and German words, there was this, in English, painted 
in white: 
</P>
<P>
"Sarah Pryor, wherever you are, we love you. Age 9. Missing October 9, 1985. 
Whalen, MA., U.S.A. God love you." 
</P>
<P>
Yant recorded this in his notebook, and when he returned to the United States 
he contacted me. He had no idea if there really was a Sarah Pryor. And if there 
was, what was the message doing on the Berlin Wall? 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that there was no city called "Whalen" in Massachusetts. But 
there is a "Wayland," and when I started talking to people in Wayland, I 
learned of the Sarah Pryor story. 
</P>
<P>
The police in Wayland were aware of the message on the Wall: Tourists in 
Germany had sent them snapshots of it. But the police, in 1987, had no idea how 
the message had gotten on the Wall, or what its significance was. Had it been 
placed on the Wall by Sarah's family? Had it been placed there by people with 
knowledge of Sarah's whereabouts? And one thing about it was so odd: All the 
details were right, including her age and the exact date she disappeared, but 
the name of the town was spelled wrong. If someone knew about Sarah's 
disappearance, why would they not know that it was "Wayland" and not "Whalen"? 
</P>
<P>
Her parents had not visited Germany and had no idea how the message got on the 
Wall. The police were just as baffled. 
</P>
<P>
And now the Wall is coming down, both symbolically and literally as people chip 
away at it. I found myself looking at the news coverage, and thinking about 
Sarah. 
</P>
<P>
"Sarah is still missing," said Lt. Gerald Galvin of the Wayland Police Dept. 
"We still do not know exactly what occurred. Every time someone reports a 
sighting of a girl they think is Sarah, we check it out. The investigation has 
gone from Maine to California to San Juan. We have nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Galvin said no one has ever come up with an answer to how Sarah's name got 
on the Berlin Wall, or why. "But that's what I thought about, too, when all the 
news was coming out of Berlin," he said. "I looked at the news coverage and I 
looked for the message about Sarah. I didn't see it. I wondered if it would be 
torn down or chipped away." 
</P>
<P>
Sarah's father said he was watching the news coverage every day, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I really had very mixed feelings," he said. "I know that what is happening 
with the Wall has great international significance. But as I looked at all the 
people climbing onto the Wall and whatnot, taking pickaxes to it -- well, I 
know that what was happening was historic, but I have to admit, I was thinking 
about something else." 
</P>
<P>
If Sarah Pryor is alive, she is 13 now.

CATHOLIC HOMILIES CRITICIZED FOR LACK OF RELATIONSHIP TO DAILY LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The homily, the Catholic equivalent of the Protestant sermon, too often 
contains pious platitudes that lack any relationship to parishioners' daily 
lives, according to U.S. Catholic magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory F. Augustine Pierce, writing in the December issue, said the sermon he 
heard last Easter had an observation something like, "God is not found in 
strength, ambition or success. God is found in weakness, humility and failure." 
</P>
<P>
The thought may have validity, Pierce wrote, but the priest who uttered it 
"failed to show what it might be." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in a poll conducted by the magazine, almost half of the readership said 
they would switch parishes if they "could hear realistic homilies about how to 
live out my faith in the workplace." 
</P>
<P>
The survey, a regular feature in the magazine published by the Claretian 
religious order, also asked readers to submit examples of "one pious platitude 
that I never want to hear from the pulpit again." Here are a few: 
</P>
<P>
* "To slow down and take time for God in my life." A reader commented: "I need 
to learn how to find God amidst the chaos of a job and two small children." 
</P>
<P>
* "The people are hungry for Christ." A reader disagreed: "Few people care 
about anything except their own materialism." 
</P>
<P>
* "Women have a different but unique place in the church." 
</P>
<P>
* How unworthy "Christmas and Easter Catholics" are. 
</P>
<P>
* "God loves you." A reader complained: "Tell that to a cancer patient (me) or 
to a mother accepting her child's drug addiction." JOHN DART

ISOLATED IN ANCHORAGE CLOISTER, NUNS SAY THEY FEEL CLOSER TO GOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ANCHORAGE, Alaska 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less hardy souls might have found the move from the tropics of central Mexico 
to the frigid environs of Anchorage more than they could bear. And even the 
most resolute of the faithful might find a life of constant prayer behind bars 
a trial of their faith. 
</P>
<P>
But for the Sisters of Perpetual Adoration -- a cloistered order of Catholic 
nuns who spend 10 hours a day, 365 days a year in prayer -- the move to Alaska 
and their life in seclusion have not presented hardship. In fact, when asked if 
they ever tire of prayer and confinement, they seem taken aback. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh no, on the contrary, we are here in seclusion, in a hidden kind of life, 
separated from the world so we can pray better," said Sister Maria Jesus, who 
entered the monastery at 14 and is now 53. "We have dedicated our lives to 
prayer. Our vacation will be in heaven." 
</P>
<P>
The nuns live behind the walls of the Monastery of the Blessed Sacrament on 
three acres of land surrounded by a residential community. They came to 
Anchorage, Alaska's biggest city, four years ago, establishing their fourth 
cloister in the United States. The order was founded in Rome in 1807 and has 70 
cloisters throughout the world, 40 of them in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Josefina, 70, has been a member of the contemplative order for 53 years, 
which comes to about 22 years worth of praying, all told. The oldest nun in the 
monastery, Sister Marta, 72, has been a member of the order 48 years. And 
Sister Maria Victorias, the mother superior, is 59 and has been in the 
community 37 years. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of their tenure in the order, the nuns are in accord on one topic: 
They have no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"I joined the order in Guadalajara when I was 22," Sister Maria said. "I had 
been working as an accountant in a business with my two brothers. I have never 
regretted my decision to leave the secular world for the monastery. I feel much 
closer to God." 
</P>
<P>
Sister Mary Margaret, 67, has spent 45 years as one of the praying nuns. She 
also is emphatic that this is her proper calling. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe I am doing the best I can for humanity by spending my life in 
prayer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although 10 hours a day may seem like a lot of praying to some, the sisters are 
not at a loss for things to pray about. 
</P>
<P>
"We pray for all the interests of the church, for the Pope, for the special 
needs of the archbishop, for the people in Alaska, whatever is important for 
the world, for all the regular things people pray for," Sister Maria said. 
</P>
<P>
It was Archbishop Francis Hurley of Anchorage who brought the nuns from their 
cloister in Guadalajara to the new Monastery of the Blessed Sacrament. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Syren, an Anchorage widow, suggested to the archbishop five years ago that 
the city have a monastery of either monks or nuns. She offered to donate the 
land for the building. 
</P>
<P>
Hurley immediately thought of the contemplative order he has known since he was 
a boy. 
</P>
<P>
"I have known the Sisters of Perpetual Adoration since I was a young altar boy 
at their monastery in San Francisco in the 1930s," the archbishop explained. 
</P>
<P>
The archbishop contacted the nuns in San Francisco and they told him that the 
Guadalajara cloister was running out of room and looking for a place to 
establish a new community. Catholics in Anchorage staged fund-raisers. Paul 
Lariviere, a carpenter and the monastery cloister project manager, architect 
Jim Hill and contractor Tom Gittins all volunteered their time, as did hundreds 
of others. The building, which includes living quarters, a chapel, kitchen and 
reception area, "cost roughly $500,000 in donated money but the building is 
easily worth $1.2 million," the archbishop said. 
</P>
<P>
The seven Guadalajara nuns moved to Anchorage four years ago. The woman who 
donated the land moved out of her home and let the nuns use it for two years, 
until the cloister was finished. The nuns, who have begun to learn English and 
applied for U.S. citizenship, are now supported by private donations. 
</P>
<P>
The nuns cook their own meals in the kitchen and each has her own room with a 
simple bed. In the chapel monastery, where Mass is said every day, bars run 
down the middle of the chapel and across the front, separating the nuns from 
other parishioners. The reception area is also separated from the nuns' living 
space by bars. 
</P>
<P>
"The bars are symbolic of their separation from the world, beyond which they do 
not come and beyond which people do not go," Archbishop Hurley said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their isolation, the nuns are cheerful and not particularly shy. When 
they're not praying or attending to their daily needs, they spend free time in 
a spacious, walled-in area behind the cloister, out of view any onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the time for our lighter moments," explained Sister Carmen, 29, a 
member of the order for 12 years. "The younger nuns jog around the track. All 
of us play volleyball. In winter, we ride sleds down a snow-covered hill. In 
summer some of us roller-skate, ride bicycles." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the apparently carefree attitude during recreation periods, the sense 
of decorum and isolation is never far removed their lives. They wear their 
red-and-white habits when they exercise and never leave the premises. Others 
shop for them. The mother superior reads the daily newspaper and decides what 
news to pass on to the other nuns, who do not have the privilege of reading the 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
Although it might appear to some as a sacrifice of personal freedom, the nuns 
make the trade-off willingly. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was on the outside I wanted material things. Now, I feel much richer 
than when I was outside. And yet, I own nothing, not even the clothes on my 
back," said Sister Carmen, 22, the eighth and newest member of the group. She 
arrived in Anchorage eight months ago from her home in Zacatecas, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"Many cannot understand our life style, not even many of our families," she 
continued. "But for us, this has brought us very close to God, and fulfills our 
potential."

The first Roman Catholic Mass from the Soviet Union to be telecast in the 
United States will be carried Christmas Eve by the Vision Interfaith Satellite 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Weber, program vice president for the cable system, said the service from 
Vilnius Cathedral in Lithuania would be presented at 9 p.m. EST on Sunday, and 
repeated Christmas Day at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Mass is to be celebrated by Archbishop Julionas Steponovicius of Vilnius, 
who is believed to secretly have been made a cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 
1979. He was allowed to resume his church duties only a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The 14th-Century Vilnius Cathedral, known as the "cradle of Lithuanian 
Christianity," was seized by Soviet authorities in the 1950s and converted into 
a secular gallery, but was returned to the church early this year.

HANUKKAH, AN EIGHT-DAY JEWISH FESTIVAL, BEGAN FRIDAY NIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRADITION: The holiday commemorates the victory over Syrian rulers by a band of 
Jews led by Judah Maccabee in 165 BC. Three years earlier, the Hellenized 
Syrian King Antiochus IV profaned the Jerusalem Temple by erecting an altar of 
sacrifice to the god Zeus. The Maccabees liberated the temple, then the focal 
point of Jewish worship. The Hanukkah festival also incorporates the legend of 
a lamp found at the rededicated temple that was thought to contain only one 
day's worth of undefiled oil. Instead, the lamp burned for eight days. 
</P>
<P>
OBSERVANCES: Also called the Festival of Lights, the holiday is celebrated 
primarily in homes. The eight-branched menorah is its principal symbol. Family 
members light one candle each night, using the flame from a ninth candle. 
Children often receive small gifts spread out over the holiday. Some Jewish 
leaders say that the holiday has grown in popular observance in the United 
States because of its proximity to Christmas. Synagogue sermons tend to recall 
the Maccabean revolt as a classic example of the striving for religious 
freedom.

MOTORCYCLE OFFICER OUT OF INTENSIVE CARE

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After three months under intensive care, injured Costa Mesa Police Officer 
Robert Baumgardner was transferred to an ordinary hospital room Friday, just in 
time for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"He's talking. He's talking up a streak," said his wife, Sally Gene 
Baumgardner, who has spent most of the three months waiting outside the 
intensive care unit of Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. Until recently, 
Baumgardner had been unable to speak and had communicated by pointing to 
letters on an alphabet board. 
</P>
<P>
The release from intensive care is a major victory for the 39-year-old 
motorcycle officer, who was struck by a car while writing a routine traffic 
ticket in September and has been fighting his way back to life ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Baumgardner, who suffered numerous broken bones and other injuries, followed by 
pneumonia and other respiratory complications, was slowly weaned from 
life-support systems last week. 
</P>
<P>
"First the sedatives, then the respirator," said Sally. "The chest tubes they 
removed one at a time, each day, and it took six days to get rid of those. 
</P>
<P>
"He's eating three square (meals) a day. And he's standing up in a walker -- 
for a couple of seconds." 
</P>
<P>
The move means the officer will be able to receive Christmas visitors, if only 
very briefly. His wife, Sally, hopes he will be well enough to go home in a few 
weeks. She said she planned to spend Christmas in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"Just spend the day and look at him, and hold his hand -- now that he can hold 
it back," she said.

CHARITIES REPORT DROP IN TOY DONATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
GIVING: SOME AGENCIES SAY CONTRIBUTIONS ARE DOWN 50%. FEAR OF FRAUDULENT 
SOLICITATIONS GETS MUCH OF THE BLAME. 
</P>

<P>
The donation of toys for needy children in Orange County has plummeted this 
year, with some organizations reporting a 50% drop in contributions, according 
to several local charities. 
</P>
<P>
"People either don't have the resources to chip in toys or they just don't want 
to," said Ellen Schneider, an office manager at the Feedback Foundation in 
Anaheim, a clearinghouse for toys donated to the Marine Corps Reserve's Toys 
for Tots program. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider and officials from other charitable organizations attributed the 
drop-off in donations to worries about fraud and disarray in charitable 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Williams, chairperson of Charities for Truth in Giving, a consortium of 
five children's charities in Orange County, said the continuing problem of 
fraud has made many prospective givers so wary of charitable-solicitation 
efforts that they simply don't give at all. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have heard about a lot of charitable fraud, and they don't 
give because they just don't know who to trust," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
The scams start with "boiler-room" operators who set up banks of phones and 
instruct solicitors to fraudulently identify themselves as representatives of a 
legitimate charity, Williams said. The callers almost always ask for cash 
contributions, which legitimate charities almost never do. The solicitors will 
often say that they need the cash to buy toys or clothing or tickets to 
sporting events for needy children, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major issue in Orange County," Williams said. "According to the 
district attorney's office, $9 million a year is given to fraudulent charities 
in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
One recent scam was perpetrated by solicitors based in Orange and Los Angeles 
counties, who telephoned homes asking for cash in the name of the Marine's 
annual Toys for Tots program, which distributes about 7.5 million gifts 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"An investigation found that it was an intricate organization, doing about 
$70,000 a day in donations," said Marine Staff Sgt. Lionel Neder, a coordinator 
of Toys for Tots at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. "Most of the people 
(who contributed) thought it was going to be coming into the program." 
</P>
<P>
Neder said the scam was exposed and operators in Pasadena and Anaheim were 
arrested. Police investigators working on the cases were not available for 
comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Neder said the scheme left some people so wary that the El Toro branch of Toys 
for Tots has collected only about 30,000 toys for this year -- half of its 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
At the Feedback Foundation, which collects the toys from the Marines and passes 
them on to county charities for distribution, Schneider said what few toys 
there are have been spread thin. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody that's requested toys this year is getting them, provided 
they did so (in a timely manner), but they're only getting a certain percentage 
of them, maybe 50% to 80% of what they've requested," Schneider said. "We've 
tried to spread it out among everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Schneider also said that communications problems among the county's charities 
was another cause for the drop-off in contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have no idea about the organization, and I don't have a set guideline 
of rules I'm supposed to follow," said Schneider, who started running Toys for 
Tots at the foundation last year. "I call them and ask if there's a central 
headquarters, and they know as much as I do. Nobody seems to know whom to 
contact." 
</P>
<P>
Neder admitted that there has been some confusion about the Toys for Tots 
program because "it's all done on the reserve side of the Marine Corps. A lot 
of the numbers that people call are of active bases. A lot of the different 
units don't know who it exactly is, so sometimes people will be chasing a few 
numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Community workers in Los Angeles also reported problems with the Toys for Tots 
program. While nearly 100,000 needy children there will receive toys, thousands 
of others will get nothing on Christmas, partly because of a decline in 
donations and disorganization in the program, the workers said. 
</P>
<P>
Requests for toys have gone unanswered, longtime recipients have been put at 
the end of priority lists, and some organizations say they believe that they 
were simply forgotten in the confusion. 
</P>
<P>
Gunnery Sgt. Charles Gaston of Los Angeles Toys for Tots said the program was 
thrown into disarray after the shutdown earlier this year of Donor Service, a 
nonprofit group that helped organizations apply for toys and screened 
applicants for the Marines. When the group closed, many organizations did not 
know where to go with questions, and the Marines found themselves ill-prepared 
to handle the screening process. 
</P>
<P>
Had to Buy Toys 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles International Airport Optimist Club was depending on Toys For 
Tots for a Christmas party at Orthopaedic Hospital last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The group had been promised 300 toys, but when the time came, there was nothing 
for them. Club members scrambled on the day of the party to buy $1,500 worth of 
toys for the children, said Optimist Bly Schwierking. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in 30 years that I can remember not getting anything," 
he said. "I have no idea what happened." 
</P>
<P>
But heads of charities in Orange County said the scams and the organizational 
problems at some charities should be no excuse for not donating toys for 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Wilhelm de Nijs, a retired psychologist who runs the Bright Light Center in 
Santa Ana, an organization that services "at-risk" children in poor 
neighborhoods, said the spirit of giving simply is not what it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
"In the '60s and beginning of the '70s, many people felt like they were winners 
and would take care of the losers," de Nijs said. "Now, everyone feels like 
they are victims, and no one gives. The answer generally is: 'Why should I 
give? I have needs also.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, de Nijs, whose group received just 120 of the 200 toys it requested from 
Toys for Tots, said he made up the difference through the generosity of high 
school and college students. 
</P>
<P>
"I really want to emphasize how great it is that young people are giving, not 
that people are giving less," he said. "A new trend is coming up among the 
young people."

HOTTEST SPOT IN CONTINENTAL U.S. IS SAN JUAN AT 82 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Weather Service reported Friday that the warmest spot in the 
continental United States was San Juan Capistrano, with a comfortable 82 
degrees. The low, meanwhile, was 47 degrees below zero at Hardin, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing the news, San Juan Capistrano City Councilman Phillip R. Schwartze 
gloated: "It's just a typical day in San Juan Capistrano. It's one of the best 
places in the world to live. The lovely weather. The beautiful green hills." 
</P>
<P>
Schwartze said he also thought that the day's high and low were "ironic" 
because a San Juan Capistrano city planner had left a few days ago to visit 
relatives in Montana. "She'll appreciate California a lot more when she gets 
back here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Normally sun-drenched Florida cities, all the way to Miami, braced for snow 
flurries and sleet this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the nation owes its cold weather to a high-pressure system 300 miles 
west of Los Angeles that was protecting Southern California from threatening 
storms, according to WeatherData Inc.

HICKS APPOINTED TO SUPERIOR COURT BENCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Dist. Atty. Cecil Hicks was appointed to a Superior Court 
judgeship Friday, and county supervisors said they expect to replace him by 
appointing his chief assistant, Michael R. Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
Some political experts say such an appointment would make Capizzi virtually 
unbeatable in next June's district attorney election, because he would be 
identified on the ballot as the incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks, 63, who had announced earlier that he would not seek another term after 
23 years as chief prosecutor, said he expects to be ready to assume his new 
post within two weeks. Also appointed by Gov. George Deukmejian to a Superior 
Court judgeship Friday was Robert B. Hutson, 47, a Municipal Court judge in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks replaces Judge Jerrold Oliver, who retired. And Hutson replaces Judge 
Judith Ryan, who also retired. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks refused to comment about his possible successor as prosecutor, citing the 
state code of conduct that restricts political statements by judges. But Hicks 
has previously announced his support for Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
If Hicks assumes the judgeship before the supervisors vote on a successor, 
Chief Deputy James G. Enright would become acting district attorney until the 
supervisors appoint a replacement. Enright is not a candidate for the June 
election. 
</P>
<P>
But supervisors say they will vote on Hicks' interim replacement as soon as 
possible, and Capizzi is believed to be a shoo-in. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Harriett M. Wieder and Roger R. Stanton said on Friday they will 
vote for Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely; no question about it," Wieder said. "I have worked well with him 
for years and he has helped the district attorney's office gain a national 
reputation." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley said that "unless something comes up I don't know 
about, Capizzi is my choice, and I hope it would be a 5-0 vote on something 
this important." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez and Don R. Roth said they were inclined to vote 
for Capizzi. 
</P>
<P>
That vote could be as early as the first week in January. But one stumbling 
block could come from one of Capizzi's opponents. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Avdeef, who is running against Capizzi along with 
Assistant Dist. Atty. Edgar A. Freeman, said Friday that he will go to court to 
stop the supervisors from appointing anyone. Avdeef claims that Proposition 59, 
passed by the voters in 1986, provides that a district attorney be replaced by 
the chief deputy -- in this case, Enright -- until an election takes place. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman said Friday that he believes the supervisors have authority to appoint 
a replacement. But Freeman said the board should appoint Enright, chief deputy 
for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy was chief deputy here when Mike (Capizzi) was just learning about 
criminal law," Freeman said. "For the board to pass over him to appoint Capizzi 
would be outrageous orchestration." 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi's response was that the board should simply appoint the best person for 
the job "and I think I am that person." 
</P>
<P>
While Freeman and Avdeef are critical of Capizzi, both have been highly 
supportive of Hicks throughout the years. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been a good prosecutor and he's going to be a good judge," Avdeef said. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks stayed late in his office Friday accepting numerous congratulatory 
telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an emotional time for me," he said. "I've not only been in this office 
23 years, I've had this same desk for 23 years. This job is how I've chosen to 
spend most of my adult life. It's not easy to pack up everything and leave." 
</P>
<P>
Presiding Superior Court Judge Phillip E. Cox said after learning the news 
about Hicks: "There isn't anyone on the bench who doesn't know Cecil. I have 
great respect for him." 
</P>
<P>
To avoid a possible conflict of interest with his former duties as chief 
prosecutor, Hicks will not be allowed to accept criminal cases, perhaps for up 
to two years. 
</P>
<P>
Hicks is a former assistant U.S. attorney who joined the Orange County district 
attorney's office in 1958. He is a graduate of UCLA and got his law degree from 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
He served as chief deputy district attorney from 1962 to 1966, when he was 
appointed to replace Kenneth Williams as chief prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
While publicly Hicks and Enright have a cordial relationship, they have been 
longtime rivals behind the scenes. Three years ago Hicks created for Capizzi 
the title of "chief assistant." While Enright remained No. 2 on paper, it is 
Capizzi who has been running the office. Enright has concentrated in recent 
years on supervising the homicide panel. 
</P>
<P>
Many believed that Enright was the only person in the office who could have 
been a formidable opponent to Capizzi next June. But so far Enright not only 
has not entered the race, he has declined to discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
Enright on Friday again declined to discuss the process of replacing Hicks 
until the election next year. 
</P>
<P>
Hutson, who has been on the bench in Fullerton since 1982, was a deputy public 
defender for six years before that. He is a graduate of Cal State Los Angeles 
and got his law degree from the California College of Law. 
</P>
<P>
The annual salary for Superior Court judges is $89,851.

OLD CITY HALL GETS SOME NEW TENANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outside, the sign on Jamboree Boulevard still reads "Civic Center," but city 
offices are nowhere to be found. Inside the brown building, the words "Police 
Department," although scratched off, can be traced on a corner partition where 
they were posted for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Civic Center and the Police Department have moved to 1 Civic Center 
Plaza, just off Harvard Avenue, where Irvine has built a new $27.8-million City 
Hall. But instead of selling the old building, the city turned it into an 
office complex for eight nonprofit groups. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all learned a little about all of the organizations here," said Linda 
Benjamin, program secretary for the Irvine Chamber of Commerce, the building's 
largest tenant. "We all get along very well." 
</P>
<P>
The building at the corner of McGaw Avenue and Jamboree Boulevard served as 
Irvine's City Hall starting in 1975, when officials moved from the original 
quarters in the old University Town Center. The Jamboree Boulevard building was 
considered a temporary facility, City Manager Paul Brady Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were supposed to have a new City Hall in 1980," Brady said. "So we actually 
got a new one about eight years late." 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the center in 1988, the city decided to keep the 
40,000-square-foot building for nonprofit groups rather than sell it, Brady 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometime in the future it could be sold," Brady said. "It was appraised 
recently for about $5 million, but who knows what it might be worth in a couple 
of years." 
</P>
<P>
The building's tenants now include the County Historical and Cultural 
Foundation, the city's Child Resource Information Center and Irvine Temporary 
Housing, where the city provides 10 apartments and two farmhouses for needy 
families. 
</P>
<P>
Another cubicle houses the Irvine Baseball Assn., headquarters for the city's 
baseball leagues. Also in the building is CSP Inc., which manages programs for 
youths, for crime victims and in child abuse prevention. The former police area 
of the building will soon become a child-care center. 
</P>
<P>
The office of For Families, a city-run program that supplies free services to 
families in stressful situations, is at the opposite end of the building from 
the chamber. Among the services offered by For Families are counseling, food, 
shelter and legal assistance. People contact the agency for a variety of 
reasons, but receptionist Dalene Bo said callers usually have one thing in 
common. 
</P>
<P>
"It all revolves around finances," Bo said. "You wouldn't think that would be 
so much of a problem, especially in Irvine, but almost without exception, 
finances are the major problem." 
</P>
<P>
Bo has been working in the building since August, when she wandered in looking 
for the adult career center, whose office is in the back. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me For Families was looking for a receptionist, up front here," Bo 
said. "I've been here ever since." LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PUPILS GATHER FOOD, TOYS FOR THE NEEDY 
</P>

<P>
There was a festive air of frenzy at Harbor View Elementary School on Friday, 
and not just because it was the day before Christmas vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Amid much laughter, chatter and last-minute wrapping, pupils at the Corona del 
Mar school wheeled, carried and dragged more than 100 hand-decorated cartons of 
gifts and food from classrooms to the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
There, parents loaded the bounty into vans that will deliver the goods to 26 
needy Orange County families. The donations are being made to the 
Adopt-a-Family program operated by Share Our Selves, a Costa Mesa-based 
charitable organization. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel good because I'm giving things," said Andrea Ashton, 6. "I 
brought two cans of soup and cans of good fruit because I thought that would be 
good for the family. It's more fun to give (than receive) because they need 
food too, and that's what we have." 
</P>
<P>
Shaina Lammerman, 7, said she feels "proud because she wants to make people 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they lost their money or lost their jobs," she said. "Their life is kind 
of hard, and I want to make their Christmas wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
The scene is repeated annually when each classroom provides Christmas dinner 
with all the trimmings and gifts for the families, most of which have three to 
six children. The goods were gathered over three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to start them in this in the first grade," said Scottia Evans, 
computer teacher and adviser to the 26-member Student Council that promotes and 
organizes the drive. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor View is one of about six Orange County elementary schools that 
participate in the program each year, said Share Our Selves director Jean 
Forbath. Another is Harbor Day, a private school, also in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Share Our Selves gives Harbor View the families' names in addition to ages and 
genders of the children who are to receive gifts. During the first week of 
December, members of the student council go to the classrooms to promote the 
drive. The children are responsible for choosing, buying and wrapping the gifts 
and food. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay Ringwald, 9, a fourth-grader in Jan Jephcott's class, said she and her 
classmates donated food for their adopted family and worked to earn $216 to buy 
toys for the four children. 
</P>
<P>
"I washed the car and cleaned my room and took care of the dogs and washed 
dishes and cleaned the house," said Lindsay, who earned $20 for her two weeks 
of work. "We got the money and had these coupons and voted on what to get and 
added up the prices on a calculator." 
</P>
<P>
After the decisions were made, some of the children went with their teacher to 
buy the gifts, including a tricycle, a fire station, an art set and a camera. 
</P>
<P>
"We also got batteries and film, because they're very expensive," Lindsay said. 
"And we got 50 or 60 pounds of food and a 20-pound turkey. They're going to 
have a big dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"I can just see the look on their faces when they receive all the toys and 
food," she said. "It makes me warm and happy that my class made that happen for 
them." LESLIE HERZOG

CHILLING PROSPECTS: WALRUSES' OCEAN DIP

The sign for the fourth annual Walrus Run early Friday read "no sissies 
please." 
</P>
<P>
After a quick Walrus bark, 75 participants began the annual mile-and-a-half 
dash at daybreak from the Newport Beach Athletic Club to Corona del Mar beach 
for a dip in the chilly 62-degree surf. The teeth-chattering tradition "started 
as a lark with seven or eight of us and just caught on," explained Rudy Svrcek, 
one of the coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of fun and this is a great bunch of guys to help bring the 
Christmas spirit," said first-year Walrus, Steve Bukich, 33. Second-year runner 
Tom Vanover, 40, likened the dip to jumping into the snow after a soak in a hot 
tub and a long day of skiing. "It's fun, everybody does it." 
</P>
<P>
This year's run included a record 10 brave women. "My husband does it every 
year and I got conned into it," said Terri Gomez, 30. After the quick dip in 
the ocean, Gomez said the Pacific wasn't as cold as she thought it would be and 
she plans to be back next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The run was easy, the water was great," said Bill White, 35. "I'm going to do 
this every day." 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was a lot colder," added veteran Walrus Rick John, 32. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Chuck Hardy, 52, didn't seem to mind the cold water. "I think it's 
fantastic. It's not as painful as I thought it would be." 
</P>
<P>
"The real walruses are going to jog back," said Svrcek. 
</P>
<P>
For those runners who returned to the club, hot beverages, croissants and warm 
Jacuzzis were waiting, along with commemorative T-shirts. MARCI HANOVER

LITERACY GROUP GETS $5,000 FOR CENTER

<P>
The United Way of Orange County has given a literacy group $5,000 to convert a 
storage room at the city's main library into a facility with computers to help 
people learn to read and write. 
</P>
<P>
Conversion of the room into a literacy learning area is scheduled to start in 
early 1990 and be finished by early summer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The United Way grant was to the Literacy Volunteers of America-Huntington 
Valley. That organization works with adults who want to learn to read and 
write. It is based at the Huntington Beach Central Library, 7111 Talbert Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The use of computers helps teach illiterate adults how to read and write, said 
Linda Light, director of the library's Adult Literacy Services. "It helps them 
work on phonics and spelling and writing and even math." 
</P>
<P>
Light said including computers in the literacy program makes it easier for 
people to ask for help. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a real act of courage to come to a (literacy) program like this and 
say, 'Teach me to read and write,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Light said men and women taking the course can honestly tell their colleagues 
that they are going to the library "to take computer instruction." She said 
this avoids the embarrassment some adults feel in telling others that they are 
learning how to read and write. 
</P>
<P>
Information about the literacy program is available by calling the Adult 
Literacy Services office at the central library, (714) 841-3773. BILL BILLITER

THE SUDDEN RETURN OF SINGER LEAVES CHORUS FOR 'HOLIDAY AT THE POPS' OUT IN THE 
COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A chorus of local singers, most of them members of the Irvine Camerata, got 
coals in their stockings from the Pacific Symphony this Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
The group of 24 professional singers, dubbed the Holiday Chorus in press 
releases, was hastily assembled to fill in on the orchestra's "Holiday at the 
Pops" program after originally scheduled singer Maureen McGovern bowed out to 
appear in a Broadway production of Kurt Weill's "The Three Penny Opera." 
</P>
<P>
But this week, the singers were just as hastily dropped from the program when 
McGovern suddenly found herself free after all, with the early closing of the 
much-panned show, which starred rock singer Sting. 
</P>
<P>
"Holiday at the Pops" was scheduled to be offered Friday and repeats tonight at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center. The 24 singers dropped from the 
program will not be paid the agreed-on $200-per-person concert fee, but each 
was offered a pair of tickets to one of the performances, according to Bruce 
Bales, assistant director of the Irvine Camerata. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of very disgruntled singers," Bales said. Many turned down 
other paying gigs during this most lucrative of seasons for singers, while some 
purchased concert tickets for family and friends or changed travel plans. 
</P>
<P>
Louis G. Spisto, the orchestra's executive director, said through a spokesman 
that the Pacific regretted any inconvenience to the singers. Some orchestra 
subscribers were unhappy when McGovern originally canceled, he said, and when 
she became available again, "we had to make every effort" to get her back on 
the program and said there was not enough time on the program to include the 
chorus. 
</P>
<P>
Bales had provided the Pacific with a list of singers in mid-November and 
conducted an informal rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
Singers had learned about 30 minutes' worth of music, including two songs in 
Spanish. Some did not learn that they were being dropped from the program until 
Wednesday, the day they were to have their first major rehearsal. Bales said he 
understands the orchestra's decision to put McGovern back on the program (she 
was advertised as the concert's star attraction when tickets went on sale) and 
realizes that the Pacific had the sudden situation "dumped in their laps." 
Still, he said, "it really has been unfair to the singers."

EXHIBIT GIVES FULL SCOOP ON HISTORY OF BIG GUY IN RED SUIT

He sees you when you're sleeping 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 -- "Santa Claus is Comin' to Town" 
</P>
<P>
Words by Haven Gillespie, music by J. Fred Coots 
</P>
<P>
He's b-a-a-a-c-k. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere you turn these days, Santa's got his eye on you. Giant blowup Santas 
beckon from car lots and rooftops while at the mall, a glossier one waits 
inside to hear the kids' wish lists. Skinny or fat, humble or spiffy, he's 
unquestionably the man of the hour. 
</P>
<P>
But how much do we really know about this guy? 
</P>
<P>
"The History of Santa Claus," a collection of porcelain figurines at the 
Fullerton Public Library, offers a glimpse up Santa's family tree. From the 
Norse God Odin to Holland's devilish Black Peter to Thomas Nast's All-American 
Santa, the exhibit presents 24 of history's best-loved Christmas characters, as 
re-created by Fullerton gift-ware manufacturer Duncan Royale. The show 
continues through Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton exhibit is curated by city librarian Carolyn Johnson, who 
stumbled upon Duncan Royale Santas in an Alaska gift shop. She contacted the 
company several months later and arranged the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-nine percent of the people I talk to don't really know who Santa Claus 
is, or where the name came from," said Duncan Royale President Max Duncan. "I 
realized that there was a real story there to tell . . . a personality beyond 
what we think of as Santa." 
</P>
<P>
"The name Santa Claus comes from the German name for St. Nicholas, Sankt 
Klaus," Duncan explained. "When they came to America, the early European 
settlers brought their image of a good guy who brought presents during the 
winter solstice. Ultimately, the name Sankt Klaus was slurred and became Santa 
Claus. So while that word is only about 200 years old, it has its roots in a 
character that's over 2,000 years old." 
</P>
<P>
According to Duncan, the American image of Santa was born just after the Civil 
War under the pen of illustrator Thomas Nast. Inspired by Clement C. Moore's 
poem, "A Visit from St. Nicholas" (or "The Night Before Christmas"), Moore 
conjured up a well-padded, rosy-cheeked gentleman with twinkling eyes and an 
impish but benevolent expression. The Duncan Royale figure shows him ready to 
begin his rounds, holding an armful of toys and raising his pipe in a cheery 
salute to the season. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan Royale, which sells its line of figurines and collector plates through 
department stores and gift shops, introduced its "Santa" collection in 1983. 
The line now accounts for about 80% of the company's production. 
</P>
<P>
The figures, which range in height from 8 to 18 inches, are conceived in the 
company's Fullerton office. The molds are then sent to their factory in Taiwan, 
where the figures are hand cast, sanded and hand-painted. Founded in 1958, the 
firm also offers figurines in wood and pewter. Retail prices range from $70 to 
more than $700. Retired figures, such as the Nast Santa, can fetch as much as 
$7,000 among collectors, Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
To complement the exhibit, the manufacturer donated several copies of "The 
History of Santa," a four-color book produced by the company that tells the 
story behind each figurine. The exhibit is best viewed with the book in hand; 
copies are available in the library's reference section. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest character in the collection is Odin, a strapping fellow in animal 
skins that, according to Norse mythology, traveled the world in midwinter 
distributing rewards and punishment to his earthly subjects. In what may have 
been the first office Christmas parties, Vikings traditionally raised a few 
horns of ale in tribute to Odin and to the season. 
</P>
<P>
Also included in the collection are the Magi, three learned men who, as the 
Bible story says, followed a brilliant star in the East to the manger of the 
Christ child. Dressed in brilliantly colored robes and gazing solemnly upward, 
the characters represent a central theme in Spain's celebration of Christmas. 
According to the Duncan Royale book, many Spanish children still address their 
Christmas letters to the Magi. 
</P>
<P>
Resplendent in crimson robes and miter, the figure of St. Nicholas, Bishop of 
Myrea, is a familiar one to many Christians. Legend has it that three poor 
sisters had drawn lots in an effort to provide two of them with dowries. The 
loser agreed to sell herself into slavery to provide gold for the luckier two. 
Hearing of this, St. Nicholas secretly dropped bags of gold into their windows. 
In the 12th Century, a group of French nuns expanded on this idea by leaving 
gifts for poor children during a nighttime visit on St. Nicholas' Eve, Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
A wreath of flickering candles tops the flaxen hair of St. Lucia, Sweden's Lady 
of Light. According to legend, Lucia helped save Sweden's children by bringing 
food during a terrible famine, appearing to them with her face aglow and a 
candle-lit wreath burning brightly on her head. On the morning of St. Lucia 
Day, Dec. 13, the oldest daughter in many Swedish families still places a 
wreath on her head and serves coffee and lussekatter to her family. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a darker side to Christmas, too. The collection also includes Black 
Peter, a nasty Dutch character dating back to the Middle Ages. With a sinister 
gleam in his eye and a beard black as coal, Peter is shown reviewing the names 
of bad children in his big black book. As the story goes, Peter (a.k.a the 
Devil) spent St. Nicholas Day doing the bidding of the good saint, dropping 
gifts down the chimneys of good children and punishing some of the naughty ones 
with a birch switch. 
</P>

Royale, continues through Dec. 30 at the Fullerton Public Library, 353 W. 
Commonwealth Ave.,

20 YEARS AGO, EROTIC SWEDISH FILM WAS SEIZED AFTER SHOWING AT BALBOA CINEMA; 
</P>
<P>
ANNIVERSARY: "I AM CURIOUS (YELLOW)" BROUGHT A NEW LEVEL OF SEXUAL EXPLICITNESS 
TO MAINSTREAM MOVIE HOUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
On Dec. 23, 1969, the Balboa Cinema audience for the first Orange County 
engagement of the infamous adult film "I Am Curious (Yellow)" included 
Municipal Judge J.E.T. (Ned) Rutter, representatives of the district attorney's 
office and Newport Beach police. Not coincidentally, the run stopped there. 
</P>
<P>
A sizable crowd for the aborted second daily screening at the Newport Beach 
movie house was turned away after police seized the print. The next day, the 
scene was replayed at the Stanton Theater (now Teatro Stanton, a 
Spanish-language cinema). Thus officials in Orange County joined a growing 
number in municipalities around the country striking out at the 
then-controversial Swedish film, which brought a new level of sexual 
explicitness to mainstream movie houses -- and became an unprecedented film 
phenomenon in the process. 
</P>
<P>
In Houston, a theater showing the film mysteriously burned to the ground. The 
film was banned in Denver, Phoenix and the entire state of Kansas. Although the 
film had been playing in Los Angeles since May, on Dec. 31, 1969, vice squads 
raided six city theaters and seized copies of the film. 
</P>
<P>
When and where the film did get to play, it drew record crowds because the 
curious -- most of whom presumably wouldn't be caught dead at a traditional 
skin flick -- were able to rationalize seeing a sexually explicit film that 
claimed artistic intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"The message of the movie," wrote Times film critic Charles Champlin at the 
time, "is that there is evidently nothing the movies cannot show and tell an 
adult audience: a general, not a fetishist or lonely-old-man audience." For his 
own part, Champlin acknowledged the film as a "social phenomenon" but found it 
"very tedious indeed and not as incisive as (director Vilgot) Sjoman hoped it 
might be." 
</P>
<P>
Linda Williams, a UC Irvine film studies professor, writes in her newly 
published history of film pornography that "legitimate, but often not very 
respectable, movie houses" that showed "I Am Curious (Yellow)" and similar 
exploitation fare "became the testing ground and, ultimately, the outlet for 
hard-core material once exclusive to the illegal stags." 
</P>
<P>
The Balboa followed that pattern, spending some time in the '70s as an X-rated 
Pussycat Theater before being transformed into a repertory theater and later 
specializing in foreign and art films under the ownership of Landmark Theatres. 
The Balboa has no special plans to mark the anniversary of the "I Am Curious 
(Yellow)" raid, theater officials said. RICK VANDERKNYFF

The Laguna Art Museum has received a challenge grant from the Kathryn G. 
Thompson Development Co. of Irvine to match, dollar-for dollar, each new or 
upgraded membership received during the museum's winter, 1990, membership 
campaign. The grant, of up to $30,000, will double the value of members' 
contributions, thus giving them the benefits of a higher membership level. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Harbor Art Museum will give a progress report in early 1990 on the 
campaign to raise $50 million for its new building, due to open in 1993, 
President Thomas H. Nielsen said this week. So far, the museum has raised $10 
million, officials report. Progress in the search for a new director -- former 
director Kevin E. Consey resigned in August -- and design details for the new 
museum building also will also be announced, Nielsen said.

Have you had enough of mall madness during this holiday season? Are you looking 
for a gift that doesn't look as if it came off a production line? Consider 
doing your shopping at Wagner House in Placentia, a historic home converted 
into a retail outlet and filled with collectibles, books, crafts and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors wander through the home's 10 theme rooms. One upstairs bedroom offers 
the Children's Book Nook, another features Lladro, Hummel and other figurines 
in antique armoires, while still another contains homemade Christmas ornaments 
and toys. The theme is even carried into the house's upstairs bathroom, where 
visitors will find towels and scented soaps for sale. 
</P>
<P>
"They (visitors) are intrigued by the house itself, as well as the unique 
offering of gifts and collectibles," said Georgia Klinkers, one of Wagner 
House's three owners and managers. "We've tried to find things that are not 
available in a mall." 
</P>
<P>
The rambling two-story house was built in 1920 by Charles Wagner. It remained 
in the family until the late 1970s, when it was sold to a local church, 
according to Klinkers. It was used as a retreat center until last March when 
Klinkers and her partners bought it. Wagner House opened for business on July 
24. 
</P>
<P>
Lunch and afternoon tea are served in the dining room, which adjoins a small 
outdoor patio. A harpist performs every Thursday evening in the dining room 
through the end of December. 
</P>
<P>
Hours: 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays; 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday. Closed Sunday. 
Lunch is served from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and tea is served from 2 to 4 p.m.

In the heart of Santa Ana, between busy 1st Street and Santa Ana Boulevard, is 
a run-down, rust-colored building with a sign that reads Annie Mae Tripp 
Southwest Community Center. 
</P>

Like many of the homes in the graffiti-splashed neighborhood, the center has a 
fence around its dirt yard and bars on its dusty windows, but everyone knows 
that at Annie Mae Tripp's place, the doors are wide open.

Seven days a week, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., neighborhood children attending the 
day-care program at the center play on the monkey bars or climb the poles of a 
swing set that has no swings, while hungry men, women and more children sit at 
picnic tables and enjoy hot breakfasts and lunches until the food runs out. 
</P>
<P>
No one talks much about the late Annie Mae Tripp, but ask anyone working in the 
immaculate kitchen about the woman whose name was honored by the center, and he 
or she will loosen apron strings, pull up a chair and tell the story. 
</P>
<P>
Tripp was a tough widow who supported eight children mostly from money earned 
cleaning houses, plus some Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of 1970, after suffering a mild stroke, she decided that her life's 
mission was to use her meager income to feed the poor. Her family couldn't talk 
her out of it. 
</P>
<P>
Tripp's adopted daughter, Jean Sancho, 60, adjusts a blue bandanna that pulls 
back her hair, and remembers the reaction to her mother's idea. " 'My God,' we 
said, 'How can we feed the poor when we're poor ourselves?' " 
</P>
<P>
Not only was the 57-year-old great-grandmother determined to feed the poor, but 
those close to her were destined to carry on her work. 
</P>
<P>
It was three years ago Thursday that Tripp died at the age of 73. But the 
Southwest Community Center she started from the kitchen of her rented house on 
3rd Street in Santa Ana continues to feed the community's hungry people 
everyday. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought I was too young to be doing all this," says Connie Jones, 37, 
who operates the center at its permanent location at 1601 W. 2nd St. 
</P>
<P>
But Jones says she feels a certain responsibility to carry on Tripp's dream -- 
and the dream is what keeps the center going. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after her stroke, Tripp asked God what he intended her to do with her 
life -- since he had spared her from serious paralysis and death. 
</P>
<P>
While she was still recuperating, she had a dream, and in it, God told her to 
feed the poor. 
</P>
<P>
Without pause, Tripp began cooking hot lunches from the kitchen of the little 
yellow house with the white picket fence where her children were raised. 
</P>
<P>
Tripp's doctors and family urged her to rest, but the strong-willed woman who 
had survived nine heart attacks was determined to carry out God's will. 
</P>
<P>
With her small income, she prepared hot lunches, and without a car, she 
initially carried food to the Second Baptist Church, where people congregated 
for free meals, before volunteer drivers were found. "We were born and raised 
on welfare," says Tyrone Tripp, Annie Mae's son and president of the center. 
"We didn't have anything. But if our cupboards were full, she didn't care who 
you were, she'd feed you." 
</P>
<P>
Within a month, Annie Mae Tripp decided she wanted to create a homelike 
atmosphere for the poor to come to for food. Bargaining with her landlord, a 
neighbor who owned a pet store at the corner of 2nd and Forest streets, 
resulted in a community center of her own. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Thompson, 58, recalls the first days of the center, when Tripp would 
speak to community groups and churches, asking for support. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a gutsy one. She would say things (at speaking engagements) and I 
would think, 'This is going to alienate the whole audience,' " recalls 
Thompson. "Then I would get up -- this middle-class white woman -- and try to 
make the whole thing palatable." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who has since received her master's degree in social work because of 
her relationship with Tripp, says that the woman's cause appealed to members of 
the primarily white church they visited. Thompson says many church-goers wanted 
to help the poor but felt an inability to do so directly. Tripp bridged the 
gap. 
</P>
<P>
Today, more than 30 churches in the county regularly help in the center's 
operation by bringing in hot lunches. 
</P>
<P>
Every morning, cooks at the center heat up the griddle on the kitchen's big, 
black gas stove and fry pancakes, eggs or bacon, and boil oatmeal, signaling to 
the neighborhood the start of a new day. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to give them a hot meal to start them off," says Sancho. 
</P>
<P>
People waiting for breakfast to be served at 8 a.m. are put to work. "I have 
them wipe off the tables," Sancho says. "They help to keep the place clean. 
Plus it gets their blood circulating while we warm up the coffee." 
</P>
<P>
The center is open for people to receive sacks of bread every day after lunch. 
Once a week, volunteers distribute bags that contain enough food staples to 
help an average family for two weeks. And there are free clothes for those who 
need it. 
</P>
<P>
But Sancho worries that there may not be enough to go around when the center 
celebrates its 19th Christmas. They are especially in need of toys for all the 
children this year. 
</P>
<P>
Sancho surveys the ceiling-high stacks and and overflowing crates of goods, and 
says she knows it looks like a lot, but it goes quickly. She explains that most 
of the goods cluttering the jam-packed, two-room building are donations from 
local groups, individuals and corporations, or bargains Jones buys with funds 
from private donations and the United Way. 
</P>
<P>
But Sancho has the experience to know everything will work out. 
</P>
<P>
Hands on her hips, Sancho looks out at the picnic tables where adults and 
children sit on an cast-away array of recliners, pews, folding chairs and 
benches, eating the day's fried chicken lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the condition of the neighborhood," says Sancho, who still lives near 
the house on 3rd Street. "When you live with these people every day, you know 
what their condition is. We may not be the fanciest thing on the block, but I 
know we do wonderful things here."

JOSEPH N. BELL: HARDENED TRADITIONS AREN'T WORTH KEEPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have just returned from my annual pre-Christmas week with my grandchildren in 
Boulder, Colo. We have followed a regular routine during this week for many 
years. The day after I arrive, we shop for a Christmas tree which I am allowed 
to buy. Then, the following night, we decorate the tree together. I'm in charge 
of the lights, then I sit back with a libation or two and act as social and art 
critic on the rest of the decorating. Over the years, this has grown from 
ritual to tradition -- one I think my two grandsons look forward to as much as 
I do. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, the tradition was upended. My grandchildren had spent the 
weekend previous to my arrival with their other grandparents in Wyoming, and 
the centerpiece of that visit was an afternoon of traipsing nearby woods -- 
with permission, of course -- to find a live Christmas tree. One was duly 
found, cut down and hauled back to Boulder. And by the time I arrived, it had 
been set up and decorated. 
</P>
<P>
While I was outwardly effusive, I was inwardly critical of the tree. It was too 
thin on top and too fat in its lower extremities. There were clearly some 
sparse areas. The lights were unevenly distributed. 
</P>
<P>
Then I realized what I was doing. Tradition had been violated, and my role had 
been preempted. My evergreen nose had been cut off. 
</P>
<P>
This foolishness didn't last very long, but it lasted long enough for me to 
relearn a lesson that surely applies year-round but is especially appropriate 
at Christmas: that tradition and change aren't mutually exclusive. There is 
enormous merit in both, and it is quite possible for them to live together in 
harmony. But sometimes tradition can be a mote in the eye of change; and that, 
it seems to me, is when tradition becomes counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
It's a fine line, indeed. Every family and every country has its own set of 
traditions. They are the stable reference points which prevent our lives from 
being in a constant state of tilt, and they are tampered with only at some 
risk. But when tradition hardens into rigidity -- into a kind of mental rigor 
mortis -- the joy is squeezed out of it. And, by then, it may be too late to 
change -- or too painful. This happens most often to religious institutions, 
where many of the precepts on which the church was founded are violated to 
defend the institution against change. It happens in families, too. 
</P>
<P>
There's no comfortable way of knowing when that time comes, beyond our own 
instincts -- and generally they can and should be trusted. Each generation 
looks at its own traditions and decides which ones to carry forward and pass 
along to their children, and that's the way it should be. But one of the 
oddities of this process is that the group most likely to resist change are the 
children themselves. To children, the familiar -- even when it isn't altogether 
satisfying -- is infinitely preferable to the unknown. 
</P>
<P>
When my children were growing up, there was a tradition of going to church on 
Christmas Eve and opening gifts on Christmas morning. When the children were 
small, the tree wasn't brought in and decorated until Christmas Eve. As each 
child grew older, he or she was allowed to participate in the activity until 
the Santa Claus myth ran its course. Celebrating Christmas now with their own 
families, they have carried on some of these traditions and discarded others. 
And their children will, in turn, do the same. 
</P>
<P>
There's a risk that as we grow older, we will revert to the child in us that 
suffers change badly and builds high defenses around tradition. That's what I 
did for a few minutes in Colorado last week -- but only for a few minutes. My 
daughter and son-in-law sensed this -- not because any of us would have wanted 
to see my grandchildren denied the experience of cutting their own tree but 
because they, too, respect tradition. 
</P>
<P>
I think the one thing that those who fear change need to understand most is 
that change need not be -- and usually isn't -- disrespectful of tradition. For 
half a dozen years when my children were in school, we drove away from the 
traditional Midwestern white Christmas to Florida, where we spent the holidays. 
But we took all our other Christmas traditions with us. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose traditions die hardest at Christmastime because the holiday is built 
around the most hallowed tradition of all: the birth of a man who changed the 
whole course of human history. But perhaps the operative word here is change. 
In his brief ministry, Jesus attacked many of the traditions of the system into 
which he was born. While his spiritual precepts were inviolate, he had no 
hesitation about changing the human environment -- and its traditions -- in 
which he put the spiritual precepts to work. And he had no problem knowing 
which was which -- a difficulty the rest of us deal with constantly. 
</P>
<P>
If these seem like heavy thoughts to grow out of the cutting of a Christmas 
tree, they were neither heavy nor new. They've been gestating for a lot of 
years and are surfaced periodically by small events. I suppose that's why just 
before I left Boulder to come home, I checked out my grandchildren's Christmas 
tree one last time. It's a beautiful tree.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: DISCUSS CHILD'S NIGHTTIME FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My 7-year-old son is suddenly afraid of the dark and begs 
not to have to sleep alone if the light is turned off. I don't want him to get 
in the habit of sleeping in my bed, so I bought an attractive little night 
light and I allow him to keep it on. His grandfather feels this is spoiling him 
and is convinced he'll grow up to be a sissy because of my "coddling." -- B.P. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR B.P.: Grandfather is badly misinformed, and your instinct is correct. Talk 
with your son about his fears of the dark, let him know that you always want 
him to discuss anything that's troubling or frightening him and that he's free 
to turn the light off or on whenever he wishes. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes youngsters associate darkness with being left alone or being lost. 
Some youngsters associate darkness with death, and if this is the case, it is 
something you need to explore and talk about. As Dr. Jonathan Kellerman points 
out in his book "Helping the Fearful Child," for 6-, 7- and 8-year-olds, death 
is often seen as someone or something who comes in the night. 
</P>
<P>
Parents who refer to death as sleep or a journey often have children who 
develop anxiety about the dark. Maybe you should ask your son if he knows why 
he suddenly developed this fear of darkness. You may be able to help him 
overcome his fear by gradually rewarding him for success when, over a period of 
weeks, he's able to reduce the wattage of the light. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My neighbor, a woman in her mid-50s, is very strange. 
Sometimes, she's the nicest person and one couldn't wish for a better, more 
considerate neighbor, but at other times, she's horrible and almost frightening 
to me. Her husband told me that she's being treated for what he calls MPD. He 
says she has more than one personality. How could this be? -- V.T. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR V.T.: Drugs and alcohol have nothing to do with this disorder, although if 
there are multiple personalities, one of these personalities may drink or abuse 
drugs. MPD, or multiple personality disorder, was considered a separate and 
highly treatable mental condition by the American Psychiatric Assn. in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
It's relatively rare, but there's little question that some individuals do have 
more than one personality -- even two personalities are enough to meet the 
definition of MPD. 
</P>
<P>
It's believed that these personality splits begin in childhood when some 
traumatic incident sets it off. Occasionally, as a reaction to serious child 
abuse, the mind fragments or splits off in order to cope with the pain and a 
separate personality emerges to deal with the next psychic assaults.

DEADLY BATTLES CONTINUE IN PANAMA; 
</P>
<P>
 FIGHTING: 2,000 FRESH TROOPS BOLSTER U.S. FORCES. CAPITAL IN NEAR-ANARCHY.

PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three days after launching a massive military operation in Panama, U.S. 
soldiers and Marines fought deadly street battles Friday with forces loyal to 
fugitive dictator Manuel A. Noriega as they struggled to restore order in 
Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon dispatched 2,000 fresh troops from the 7th Infantry Division in 
Fort Ord, Calif., to supplement the 22,500 U.S. troops already in Panama, 
officials in Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
At mid-day, a brief mortar attack on the headquarters of the U.S. Southern 
Command at Quarry Heights sent military officials and reporters accompanying 
them diving for cover under a table. And U.S. soldiers throughout the city came 
under repeated attack from snipers hiding in burned out high-rise buildings in 
a poor section of Panama City known as El Chorrillo. 
</P>
<P>
One U.S. soldier was killed in action Friday, military officials said. After 
revising a previous count, they said the total number of military casualties 
since the operation began about 1 a.m. Wednesday stood at 21. In addition, two 
civilian dependents have been killed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
On the Panamanian side, U.S. officials said that 127 troops have been killed in 
action and 69 wounded. There has been no official count of civilians killed or 
wounded during the fire-fights and U.S. military assaults on Noriega's military 
facilities near crowded Panama City barrios. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Santo Tomas Hospital in Panama City reported that 200 bodies are 
stored there, and Gorgas Hospital said it has 60 more. A spokesman appealed for 
medical supplies from Latin America and Europe because "the United States is 
only giving us bullets." 
</P>
<P>
Reports from Panama City indicated that three days into the largest U.S. 
military action since the Vietnam War, the capital of Panama remained in a 
state of near-anarchy. But U.S. officials in Washington said order was 
gradually being restored. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to do what is necessary to help the people of Panama achieve 
the democratic society that they voted for and that they so rightfully 
deserve," President Bush declared during a speech at the National Institutes of 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what our American soldiers are achieving -- freedom and human liberty 
for those who have endured brutal tyranny and brutal oppression," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At a Pentagon news briefing, Army Lt. Gen. Thomas W. Kelly, director for 
operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimated that U.S. forces will need 
another 5 to 10 days to clear the city of hostile forces. 
</P>
<P>
"It's simply a difficult operation ...," Kelly said. "There are a lot of places 
to hide" in Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. troops had secured the 
Legislative Assembly building, where Guillermo Endara, who was installed as 
president on a U.S. military base minutes before the invasion began, 
established his offices. 
</P>
<P>
But as Ricardo Arias Calderon, one of Endara's vice presidents, was leaving the 
Assembly building Friday, members of one of Noriega's paramilitary Dignity 
Battalions shot at his car. Arias was uninjured but two of his aides were 
wounded, an Arias aide said. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said that U.S. forces also had secured the Foreign Ministry, the 
Health Ministry, the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"We're particularly concerned about the Central Bank and the Finance Ministry 
because they now can begin dealing with the money that will be needed for the 
economic development of the country," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not cleared this area out," said Col. Mike Snell, escorting reporters 
on a tour of a neighborhood that housed the bombed-out headquarters of the 
Panama Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still people with weapons around. To secure this area totally is 
going to take months of work and a combination of military and other forces," 
he said. "Everybody downtown has a gun." 
</P>
<P>
The fighting between U.S. forces and Noriega loyalists near the headquarters of 
the U.S. Southern Command lasted for about an hour at mid-day. 
</P>
<P>
Mortars rounds were fired from railway tracks below the headquarters at Quarry 
Heights, overlooking Panama City, sending military officials and reporters in a 
nearby building to seek cover under a table. Snipers were reported in nearby 
hills. In the Balboa Heights neighborhood not far away, a warehouse near the 
headquarters of the Panama Canal Commission was hit by mortar fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Things like that can happen in a city that's in the shape that Panama City is 
in," said Kelly, who is director of operations of the Pentagon's Joint Staff. 
"We are moving out to correct these things. Popping off one mortar round is a 
fairly easy thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the situation is under control, he replied: "I am satisfied it's 
under control, yes." 
</P>
<P>
As the mortar fire struck Quarry Heights, the Supreme Court building a mile to 
the southeast was reported in flames. And from the vantage point of Rodman 
Naval Station across the Panama Canal from Quarry Heights, watchers could see 
rising plumes of brown and black smoke, while U.S. Army helicopters flew over 
the area, apparently searching for attackers. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Maxwell Thurman, head of the U.S. Southern Command, blamed Noriega's 
Dignity Battalions -- paramilitary militiamen often described by American 
officials as "thugs" -- for much of the continuing violence. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of (members of) Dignity Battalions are loose in the city," he told a 
news conference at his headquarters, "and we are having to work hard to get 
those particular units under control." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said of the Dignity Battalions: "They're looting, sniping. They are 
lawless. There are some others who are lawless. However, we have been able to 
make some progress. We have the 82nd Airborne in the city moving from northeast 
to southwest; the 193rd Brigade with elements of the 6th MP Company moving from 
southwest to northeast. At some point they'll link up." 
</P>
<P>
As U.S. troops made their way through the city, they were frequently greeted 
with the thumbs-up or V-for-victory sign. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of people cheering us on and clapping. They are on our side," 
said Lance Cpl. Tracy Scott Jones, 24, a Marine from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Kelly in Washington said that U.S. planes with food, medicine and other 
necessary supplies will be dispatched to Panama by Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to restore law and order, build a police force, take care of emergency 
food distribution, establish a night watch -- and we're doing that with 
helicopters that have searchlights on them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are still people out at night trying to loot and do those kinds of 
things, and the helicopters last night were fairly successful in preventing 
that from being done," Kelly said. "Protect persons and property, clean up the 
city and that's from a sanitation standpoint. The city's quite dirty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said that 10,000 Panamanian weapons have been located in three caches: in 
the PDF headquarters, at Ft. Cimarron, and at Rio Hato. Others put the cache at 
9,326 weapons, 25 airplanes, 16 armored cars and five patrol boats. 
</P>
<P>
"These are not a bunch of old French muskets lying in the basement of a 
building. These are, in many, many cases, new weapons still packed ... fully 
functional and ready to go once they're cleaned," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers and condition of Americans who may be held hostage by Noriega 
loyalists remained unclear. CBS News producer John Meyersohn was still missing 
Friday after having been abducted Wednesday from the Marriott Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
In soccer stadiums, churches and schools, thousands of refugees took cover from 
the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
In the ravaged city, supermarkets and other stores were empty, victims of a 
binge of looting that cleared out furniture stores, car lots and nearly all 
other retail establishments, and garbage rotted on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Thurman said that $1-million reward that Bush has offered for information 
leading to the capture of Noriega "is producing a substantial number of bits of 
information on his whereabouts." 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials, who initially expressed optimism about finding the 
Panamanian leader, displayed no such views Friday, declaring that they had no 
idea when he might be captured. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Noriega's ability to elude his pursuers, support for the U.S. operation 
showed no signs of abating at home. 
</P>
<P>
As poll after poll showed overwhelming public support, Senate Armed Services 
Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), ranking 
Republican on the panel, emerged from a three-hour briefing with Defense 
Department officials expressing even greater support for the invasion than they 
had announced earlier.

COLUMBIA PICKS NEW AGENCY FOR TRI-STAR ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. said Friday that it pulled its Tri-Star 
Pictures domestic advertising account from the Los Angeles branch of AC&amp;R 
Advertising and gave it to McCann-Erickson Worldwide, which now places domestic 
advertising for the company's Columbia Pictures unit. 
</P>
<P>
The Tri-Star account, which involves media placement of the studio's movie ads, 
is estimated to have billings of between $70 million and $75 million and is 
believed to be among AC&amp;R Los Angeles' largest accounts, if not its 
largest. 
</P>
<P>
Its loss is a serious blow to AC&amp;R, a unit of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co., 
which has lost other entertainment accounts in the last few years, most notably 
NBC Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been going on for a long time, and I have no idea why they changed," said 
R. Lynn Livingston, president of AC&amp;R's Irvine office. 
</P>
<P>
For McCann, it means a total of $150 million in Columbia billings. McCann 
prevailed in an account review that included Grey Advertising and Backer 
Spielvogel Bates. McCann officials could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston said the change may have been prompted by the recent $3.4-billion 
buyout of Columbia Pictures Entertainment by Japan's Sony Corp. a month ago, 
but a Columbia spokesman who asked not to be identified said the decision was 
unrelated to the buyout.
