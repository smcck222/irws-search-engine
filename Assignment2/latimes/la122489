WILD CHILD TURNS TEDIOUS IN SYDNEY; 
</P>
<P>
ANCESTORS BY ROBYN DAVIDSON (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $19.95; 266 PP.; 
0-671-68062-5) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Janette Turner Hospital, Turner Hospital grew up in Queensland and spends 
part of each year there, though she now divides her time among Australia, 
Canada and Boston. She has just finished several months as writer-in-residence 
at the University of Sydney, and her most recent novel is Charades (Bantam). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In late July, when "Ancestors" was released in Australia, the tabloids and 
television talk shows went into high gear. Robyn Davidson has been a staple of 
celebrity gossip Down Under since her highly publicized 1,700-mile trek across 
the outback with a team of camels (recorded in a finely written nonfiction 
book, "Tracks") and her equally publicized, lengthy and tempestuous 
relationship with Salman Rushdie. In July, the buzz from Sydney parties and 
gossip columnists was that the Camel Lady had written a thinly disguised 
autobiographical roman a clef about the Grand Passion. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewers had two questions: How close is Zac Appelfeld to Salman Rushdie? 
And what do you think of the portrait of yourself as explorer Alleluia Cone in 
"The Satanic Verses"? Davidson handled these questions with dignity and 
intelligence, pointing out that the links between life and the novel were the 
private business of the writer. She asked, quite properly, that her work be 
judged on its own terms. 
</P>
<P>
By those terms, the first 60 pages of "Ancestors" form a fine novella of a 
childhood in the rain forest of North Queensland. The rest of the book is a 
very bad novel of the kind one might expect to see excerpted in Cosmopolitan, 
absorbing reading only if your taste runs to the Jackie Collins kind of 
sensationalism and fervid sexual cliche. Lovers always are "quivering with 
emotion" or swallowing each other's souls or speaking with voices "smooth as 
warmed honey" or engaging in the following sort of steamy banality: "Each night 
with him took me deeper into a syrupy, enervating swamp from which I would 
struggle to rise at daybreak, only to sink back into sensual ooze." 
</P>
<P>
Lucy McTavish is orphaned at age 7 and consigned to the care of a dotty maiden 
aunt in North Queensland. In the rain forest, Lucy leads the life of a wild 
child, fiercely independent, precociously intelligent, bored with the 
one-teacher school, drawn into intellectual kinship and sexual experimentation 
with Wally Gajic, crazy Wally, despised son of a drunkenly violent immigrant 
father. This is the good part of the book. Davidson re-creates powerfully the 
Dickensian aura of country schooling in Queensland. She evokes the hedonism, 
the self-reliance, the sense of awe and the taste for adventure that 
rain-forest childhoods breed. 
</P>
<P>
It is when Lucy is sent off to boarding school in Brisbane that the writing 
plummets into banality and self-indulgence. It is as though Davidson needs 
desert or jungle to give her writing sinew. Her protagonists (the explorer-self 
in "Tracks," Lucy in "Ancestors") are complex in solitary relationship with the 
environment, tacky with other people. 
</P>
<P>
Lucy's picaresque adventures accumulate: boarding-school rebellion, flight to 
Sydney, communal counterculture living, hazy left-wing politics, much casual 
sex, long stint as gangster's mistress, impassioned training in secret as a 
tightrope walker ("I saw myself a hundred feet in the air, spotlights following 
me as I serenely sailed through space, risking death in order to give my life 
meaning, borne aloft on the adoration of an infinite audience." 
</P>
<P>
Sudden success in the circus, fame, world touring, fateful meeting with Zac at 
Sydney party, grand passion, betrayal, madness, flight back to rain forest, 
long therapy sessions with the ghosts of ancestors (these are interspersed 
throughout the novel, all of which is told in flashback), peace finally 
achieved in sentimental and laughably improbable reunion with Wally Gajic. 
(Davidson would have done well to check the libraries and bookstores of small 
North Queensland towns recently, before she had Wally, the rain-forest recluse, 
steal their copies of Foucault, Kierkegaard, and Spinoza). 
</P>
<P>
Throughout this latter section of the book, characters are cardboard cutouts. 
Lucy tells us with tedious frequency that others find her beautiful, 
irresistible and complex, but as a character in the novel, she is 
one-dimensional and tiresomely self-obsessed. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the literary reader cannot resist returning to "The Satanic Verses," 
and there are many striking instances of intertextuality, most notably the 
scene where the male lover defaces (in ominous ways) publicity posters of the 
famous explorer/circus performers. The literary truth strikes harshly when the 
novels are read in tandem: Alleluia Cone is a scintillating and intelligent 
woman; Lucy McTavish (except in early childhood) is not. One wants to urge 
Davidson: Return to your true grand passion, the solo affair with Nature. 
There, as a writer, you excel.

The PBS documentary "When We Were Young: Growing Up on the Silver Screen" might 
have been interesting and informative had it not been for the stupid and 
ridiculous narration. It was so insulting to the intelligence that I could 
stand only about 45 minutes of it. Anyone who lived through the era would know 
all about the material Maureen Stapleton was given to read. Compare that to the 
Richard Burton programs or the series on Hollywood that James Mason did. These 
were programs with substance that were filled with fascinating and little-known 
material.

I'd like to compliment Michael DeLorenzo, who plays Alex Torres on "Head of the 
Class," for being a true sight to watch every Wednesday night. Up until now, I 
wasn't a devout fan of the series, but with the additional characters, I find 
the show very appealing.

"The Wonder Years" is so painfully realistic that I'm certain its writers were 
once junior high school students! I've been out of junior high school for 23 
years now, but with each new episode, I feel myself reliving those awkward, 
frustrating years. The show is terrific, but let's tone down the realism. I get 
enough stress watching "thirtysomething."

I saw "The Cosby Show" episode about pregnancy and thought it was one of the 
funniest yet. I didn't think it was in poor taste at all. A man will never know 
what it's like to be pregnant and the way the show portrayed how a man might 
dream about it was absolutely hilarious although it looked more like a 
nightmare!

The reason "It'z Fritz" comes on before "Showtime at the Apollo" as Denice 
Fractious pointed out (Viewers' Views, Dec. 3) is because of the funny comics 
and musical bands that appear on the show.

RICHARD EDER: LIFE AMONG THE MEANDERTHALS; 
</P>
<P>
TRIANGULATION BY JACK STEPHENS (CROWN: $18.95; 282 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By RICHARD EDER

<TEXT>
<P>
In a day or two or a week or two, depending on family tradition and energy, the 
Christmas trees will come down, a skeletal process having more to do with the 
logic of wires than the illogic of beauty. 
</P>
<P>
A novel is both mantling and dismantling; it puts itself away after putting 
itself up. If it uses a plot or plots -- and most novels still do -- it tries 
to find an ending worthy of its beginning and middle. This does not mean that 
the ending needs to match the preceding discovery and excitement. What it 
should do, often quietly, is to fix them with a seal; like raising a flag after 
climbing a mountain, or framing a picture once it has been painted. 
</P>
<P>
"Triangulation" lacks a frame or a seal. Instead of being gathered up, Jack 
Stephens' Christmas tree teeters over in a shower of needles and broken 
ornaments. But it is a lovely tree. 
</P>
<P>
His story about a dozen colliding and far-fetched lives in and about Baltimore 
and the Maryland shore is what you hope a first novel will be, and hardly ever 
is. Talent outruns technique but only because talent is running so very fast. 
Running just as fast, in unlikely couples, are absurdity with tenderness and a 
canny peacefulness with unbelted anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Stephens has something to say of his own about contemporary life. He 
gives us a marvelous static, and from underneath the static, he draws out a few 
persistent voices. 
</P>
<P>
"Triangulation" sets a series of characters going about their respective 
businesses, ranging from mildly odd to outright crazy. The oddness comes not so 
much from themselves as from their mutual disconnection, even though they 
wander through the same streets and continually intersect. Our modern world, in 
other words: odd. 
</P>
<P>
Among them, to give an idea of the variety, are a medical statistician named 
Guy, a kleptomaniac fortune teller, an accident victim, a woman with a 
congenitally deformed arm, an amateur astronomer, two moonshiners, a pair of 
detectives, a grounded astronaut, a helicopter pilot and others. 
</P>
<P>
A thread of plot declares the randomness. A half-mad conceptual artist -- 
Stephens makes contemporary art part of the static -- goes around Baltimore 
igniting tiny Molotov cocktails in public lavatories. He then clips out 
newspaper photographs of burned-out toilets and mounts them on large buttons. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately, he calls himself Meander, and part of the action involves 
various of the characters in Meander's zigzag trail. The detectives meander 
lethargically after him. One of them spends his time tying dry-flies and 
speaking in today's interrogative of non-assertion. "You're under arrest?" 
</P>
<P>
Under the meander, though, some are trying to walk a path, and they acquire the 
notable concentration of swimmers in a whirlpool. 
</P>
<P>
Cordelia, one of whose arms is tiny and comes to a two-fingered prong, is 
looking for a man who can give her a baby. Her solution is bizarre, but 
Stephens surmounts the bizarre by writing of her with a wonderful delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
Markley, an amateur astronomer, has built himself an observatory in an old silo 
("vessel of foresight to vessel of vision"). His passion is to discover a new 
comet. Again, Stephens' writing fuses post-modern oddness with a tenderly 
detailed account of the observatory and its workings. A belching, precarious 
corn-whiskey still, operated by two retired Chesapeake watermen right beside 
Markley's silo, is another conjunction of comic oddity with a true pleasure in 
the way people make things. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the two central figures. One is Sophie, raped in college and 
living in a kind of carefree denial ever since. Until she is sideswiped by a 
truck and knocked into a ditch, where she lies, grievously injured, for three 
days. Her long stay in the hospital is a double recovery; she learns to live 
with pain as an equal. 
</P>
<P>
She also falls in love, through a series of notices in the Personals section of 
the paper. These consist of letters between R., who writes passionately, and 
Guy, who stays aloof. Sophie, signs herself C. -- it stands for "chartreuse," 
the color of her bruises -- and joins in. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Guy writes the R. letters as well as his own. He is trying to find 
something more spacious and mysterious than his current affair. He is dating a 
woman whose own space is so important to her that the only permitted 
love-making consists of mutual massage with a machine called Big Max. "More 
oil," she commands, lying face down. "Shall I check under the hood?" he 
inquires. 
</P>
<P>
Guy is a rudderless joke, in a way, a contemporary Everyman; but he has been 
brought up against the realities that contemporary life tends to conceal. He is 
a research statistician working on AIDS; he goes to the afflicted to gather 
their statistics; he comes away with their pain. It makes him desperate, and 
human. 
</P>
<P>
All the wanderers converge at the Maryland State Fair in a spectacular 
denouement. It is messy and forced. Stephens is trying to tie everything 
together in a pyrotechnical mix of slapstick and melodrama. Instead, it all 
flies apart; the characters who possessed such individuality and grace as they 
wandered, lose everything but activity when they arrive. 
</P>
<P>
But "Triangulation," a work of enchantment and gravity, has done a great deal. 
It is about the simultaneity of modern life; the mind-numbing rattle of 
indistinguishable events, each occupying its allotted few seconds of public 
attention. And it is about the ability of men and women to preserve their 
idiosyncrasy, to hear their own voices in the din, and to keep on using them.

What a pleasant surprise to find "Fear and Reality in the Los Angeles Melting 
Pot" (by Joel Kotkin, Nov. 5). Congratulations -- you have managed to capture 
the flavor and complexity of the demographic changes in the L.A. area. The 
overall positive portrayal is a refreshing change from other doom-and-gloom 
reports. The photos were beautiful.

The possibilities already unfolding within immigrant groups in our area will 
one day make our city the envy of the world. Not because their great industry 
will complement the already burgeoning financial success of Southern 
California. Not because the sum of their strengths will produce a society 
greater than its parts. Not because we will have overcome most of the tensions 
and fears we now feel. 
</P>
<P>
No, we shall be envied because we have become a place, where, in Martin Luther 
King's magnificent words, "a person is not known for the color of his skin, but 
for the content of his character." 
</P>
<P>
In recognizing this truth, we shall be reaching for perhaps the most important 
part of the American dream.

Kotkin says that the RAND Corp. study indicates that Latinos commit crimes at 
rates slightly lower than blacks or whites. However, most, if not all, of 
L.A.'s Hispanic barrios are littered with ugly, intimidating gang graffiti made 
by the violent street youth that inhabit those neighborhoods. I have spent more 
than two dozen Saturdays helping paint over the graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
After growing up in mostly white neighborhoods where this type of behavior was 
virtually unheard of, I deeply resent this low-class aspect of Hispanic 
culture.

I was truly incensed at the statement that immigrants will not become 
Americans. We are Americans before we ever get here, because Mexico, Guatemala, 
El Salvador, Colombia and Peru are all America, the American continent. 
</P>
<P>
Who gave Anglos permission to settle in Massachusetts and Virginia? God? Well, 
God told us to come here, too, thank you very much, with the difference that 
Mexicans did not "come" from anywhere but were here since way before Plymouth 
Rock. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe now the Anglos will get a taste of how the Indians felt.

Photo, CAPETOWN, SOUTH AFRICA. An open casket displays the body of 11-year-old 
Michael Cheslyn Miranda, one of three boys shot by South African police in a 
1985 confrontation that became known as the "Trojan Horse incident." The police 
had concealed themselves in crates on the back of a truck that was driven down 
a residential street in Cape Town's Athlone township. A crowd of about 200 
gathered and threw stones at the truck as it passed a second time. Without 
warning, the police emerged from hiding and fired pump-action shotguns into the 
crowd. Pathologists' reports showed that Michael Miranda and another boy had 
been shot in the back. International reaction to this incident contributed to 
the South African government's decision to crack down on news reporters and 
photographers who cover such events, as reported in "Beyond the Barricades" 
(see review this page). After a judicial inquest found the security officers 
responsible for the deaths, the first private murder prosecution of this kind 
against security forces was initiated by family of 16-year-old Shaun Magmoed, 
who also died in the incident. The 13 defendants were acquitted Dec. 11.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: YULESPEAK;

<P>
HOW TO HAVE YOURSELF A MERRIAM-WEBSTER'S LITTLE CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE LANGUAGE of Christmas has hardly changed since Chaucer's time. That's 
because the essence of this holiday is tradition and change is resisted. We 
have carols and wassail and Christmas trees and the exchange of gifts, and 
nobody wants it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
Now and then we see a pink Christmas tree, and it is probably plastic, but such 
trifling innovations don't change the spirit of the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
According to Merriam-Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary, the words 
Christmas, yule, wreath, mistletoe, holiday, holly and angels date from before 
the 12th Century. Carol, Xmas and wassail are also many centuries old. 
</P>
<P>
The word Christmas itself comes from the Old English word Christes maesse, 
which literally means Christ's Mass, and it is celebrated throughout the 
Christian world on Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
During the first few centuries of the church, however, it was celebrated on 
various days in January, April, May, September and October, because the early 
theologians disagreed on Christ's birth date. Finally, in AD 340, the Pope 
settled on Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's sets to rest a common misconception about the word Xmas, which is 
often thought of as a sort of sacrilegious, modern, shortcut slang word for 
Christmas. Not so. 
</P>
<P>
The word Xmas has perfectly good credentials. The X in Xmas is a symbol for 
Christ from the Greek letter chi, the first letter of Christos. A chi looks 
much like our X, and the word Xmas has been in use since 1551. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, it still looks like slang to me. 
</P>
<P>
Yule, another word that means Christmas, also dates from before the 12th 
Century and is related to the Old Norse word jol, which originally meant a 
pagan winter feast. Yuletide first appeared in English during the 15th Century. 
</P>
<P>
To "troll the ancient yuletide carols" is a tradition that dates to the singing 
of the "heavenly host" of angels on the first Christmas day: "Glory to God in 
the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men." 
</P>
<P>
Carol comes from the late Latin choraula, meaning choral song; it dates in 
English from the 14th Century. Troll means to sing, and comes from the 15th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
To go a-wassailing is to sing carols from house to house. Originally wassail 
was an Old Norse toast -- ves heill, meaning "be well." From that term came the 
name of the cheerful holiday concoction made of wine, beer, cider, spices and 
sugar. 
</P>
<P>
Few words have been added to the Christmas lexicon in recent centuries, but 
Scrooge -- a name we get from the born-again miser of Charles Dickens' beloved 
story, "A Christmas Carol" -- is an exception. 
</P>
<P>
Even more recently, the word grinch has become popular. A grinch is 
anill-tempered cynic invented by Dr. Seuss in his children's book, "The Grinch 
Who Stole Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Decking the halls with leaves of holly originated among the ancient converted 
Danes. They believed that holly was used for the crown of thorns at the 
Crucifixion, and that the red berries represented drops of blood. 
</P>
<P>
The use of mistletoe goes back to the pagan Druids. It is a parasite that grows 
on apple and oak trees. Druid priests made a solemn rite of collecting it from 
oak trees. People paid them for pieces of the plant, believing that it kept 
witches away. 
</P>
<P>
The present notion that strangers may kiss under its aura is much more benign. 
(If the Druids were right, one is not in danger of kissing a witch.) 
</P>
<P>
As for Santa Claus, that name is a corruption (through the Dutch Sinter Claes) 
of Saint Nicholas, a 4th-Century bishop of Myra, in ancient Lycia (Turkey), who 
was much beloved of children and sailors for his alleged miracles in their 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
How this hazy figure became the jolly fat man who drives reindeer through the 
sky, squeezes down chimneys and leaves toys for children in millions of homes 
at Christmas is beyond my learning. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I don't believe in him, and I don't think parents should con their 
children into believing in him, either. 
</P>
<P>
Children with normal intelligence will soon figure out that the old fellow is a 
fraud, and they will never trust their parents again. 
</P>
<P>
This breach of faith at an age when children are entirely dependent on the 
parents for their perception of truth and reality can never be mended. 
</P>

FEAR AND REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your story was peppered with references to "Anglos." From my daily reading of 
The Times, I assume you use this word to mean European-American (or its 
shorthand equivalent, white) to denote people who are not Afro-American, 
Asian-American, American Indian or Latino. If my reading is correct, you are 
guilty of using a term that is imprecise at best and offensive at worst. 
</P>
<P>
I can see two possible justifications for your use of Anglo. Anglo could either 
refer to ethnic ancestry or to a mother tongue. In the first case, Anglo would 
apply only to people with English ancestry and would be a misnomer when applied 
(as in Times stories) to German-, Irish- and Hungarian-Americans and the many 
other European-Americans with no English ancestry. In the second case, Anglo 
would describe the majority of Asian-Americans and others of non-European 
ancestry, contrary to your use of the term. 
</P>
<P>
I am offended by your use of Anglo. On one hand, it negates my non-English 
European ancestry, which includes one immigrant parent. I resent being called 
Anglo just because I, like the children of many other immigrants, speak English 
better than any other language. Furthermore, I have read in The Times that some 
Latinos consider Anglo a derogatory term.

FEAR AND REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your story was both heartwarming and frustrating. I am myself an immigrant, and 
the stories you included brought back memories of similar situations in the 
life of my family and the many families who came from Europe in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
We also had no money and nothing but our bare hands. However, if you were to 
write our stories, there would be no mention of affirmative action, legal aid, 
health services, loans, bilingual education and lobbying. Yet we all managed to 
create good lives for ourselves and, what's more, are loyal, proud citizens of 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
While the immigrants whose stories appeared in your article have commendable 
attitudes, I wonder why you did not interview the "other" new immigrants. We 
have all experienced them -- the rude, surly, pushy or otherwise unpleasant 
immigrants who seem to lack all respect for this country, its people and 
customs. 
</P>
<P>
My theory is that we have made it too easy for them. By providing too many 
services and benefits we have taught them that it's all here for the taking, 
and there is no giving required. 
</P>
<P>
Your article quoted a Persian poet as saying "a human being is like a nail. The 
more you hammer on top of it the more it is driven in and becomes stronger." 
That may be the approach we need to produce a better citizen. It has worked 
before.

<P>
PROGNOSTICATIONS, PROPHECIES AND JUST PLAIN GUESSES ABOUT WHAT THE LAST DECADE 
OF THE 20TH CENTURY WILL BRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK JONES, Jack Jones retired in 1989 after 34 years as a Times staff 
writer. His last story for this magazine was Tales From the Freeway.

<TEXT>
<P>
THE WORLD CHANGED SO DRAMATICALLY in the 1980s, particularly in the past few 
months, that at times one felt nostalgic about last week. The 1980s saw the 
collapse of communism in Eastern Europe; the diagnosis of a deadly disease -- 
AIDS -- that has escalated into a worldwide epidemic, and the ascendancy of 
American conservatism. Indeed, so much changed so rapidly in the waning years 
of the decade that the prospect of contemplating more U-turns in the 1990s 
makes one a bit lightheaded. 
</P>
<P>
But these are vertiginous times, like it or not. The calendar dictates a new 
decade, ready or not. We aren't reckless or presumptuous enough to try to label 
the '90s before they arrive, but we thought it might be wise to ask for help in 
preparing for the next spin of the wheel of history. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the specialists we queried were ill at ease about trying to gaze into 
the future. Because events have a way of embarrassing horse-racing handicappers 
and denim salesmen, the squeamishness evoked by questions about peace, 
economics and environmental issues is understandable. But, with a little 
prodding, we came up with a panel of 14 prophets who speculated, wondered, 
expounded, hedged and warned about the coming years. Two main currents stand 
out: sweeping optimism and chilling pessimism. 
</P>
<P>
So don't expect a dull decade. And don't blame us if they turn out to be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
THE ENVIRONMENT: DAVID R. BROWER 
</P>
<P>
Brower, a leader in conservation issues for 50 years, is chairman of the San 
Francisco-based environmental group Earth Island Institute. 
</P>
<P>
THERE HAS TO be in the coming decade a major move toward restoration of the 
earth. We've got to put back together, as well as we can, the things we took 
apart since the Industrial Revolution. It was a big party. Now the bills are 
coming in: global warming, acid rain, holes in the ozone layer, loss of species 
and loss of hope. We've got to turn that all around. All we can do is give 
nature a chance. If we continue the worst addiction of all -- the addiction to 
gasoline -- nature won't get that chance. 
</P>
<P>
Of course we're going to do it. All we have to do is say that's where we want 
to go. We can't restore the rain forest, but we can give it our best stab. As 
for global warming, it's certainly going to be slowed down, and we'd better 
reverse it. The last moment -- or the next to the last moment -- has arrived. 
As somebody said, "The threat of being hanged gets one's attention." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it is the pessimism of others that makes me optimistic. The very 
strength of Bill McKibben's presentation in his book, "The End of Nature," will 
draw attention. So will the Conservation Foundation-sponsored report on toxic 
chemical pollution in the Great Lakes and its threat to fish, birds, mammals, 
reptiles and 35 million people. 
</P>
<P>
There are several great pieces of news: Mercedes is developing a car that burns 
hydrogen. The Valdez Principles (a code of conduct recently introduced by a 
coalition of environmental groups, religious organizations and investors) are 
suggesting what big and small investors in big corporations can require them to 
do to be socially responsible. The Council on Economic Priorities has put out a 
booklet, "Shopping for a Better World," telling people which corporations are 
doing well environmentally and which aren't. We can invest and vote with our 
purchases every day. 
</P>
<P>
RACE RELATIONS: ALVIN POUSSAINT 
</P>
<P>
Poussaint is an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and 
a senior associate in psychiatry at the Judge Baker Children's Center in 
Boston. He is the author of "Why Blacks Kill Blacks" and co-author of "Black 
Child Care." 
</P>
<P>
I'M A LITTLE PESSIMISTIC about race relations in this country during the 1990s 
because of the number of new immigrants, particularly Hispanic Americans and 
Asians. They will be competing for jobs. We already have animosity between 
blacks and Latinos. We still have a lot of poverty in black and Hispanic 
communities. A recent congressional report indicated that 50% of black children 
in the United States live in poverty. They are more likely than other young 
people to be involved in drugs and crime or to be killed. 
</P>
<P>
With the general population feeling threatened, all the issues such as drugs 
and crime are going to come out in racial terms. There will be more 
segregation. And with the sliding backward of affirmative action and set-aside 
programs, you leave people in power who were in power before. There is more 
cronyism and nepotism. 
</P>
<P>
There are disturbing signs that the advances since the 1960s are fading. 
College enrollment of blacks is declining. In the past 15 years, the number of 
blacks in medical schools has not gone up. 
</P>
<P>
There has been the killing of blacks by whites at Howard Beach and in the 
Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn and the attack by black youths on a white woman 
jogger in Central Park. There was the battle between the police of Virginia 
Beach and a crowd of predominantly black students. These incidents further 
polarize the two groups, raising the levels of animosity and fear. After years 
of quiescence, there have been racial incidents on college campuses that hadn't 
had any before. 
</P>
<P>
The post-Martin Luther King generation, young people with negative feelings 
toward a lot of groups -- somehow they feel legitimacy in expressing these 
views. Despite the success of black athletes that white kids worship, too, 
despite a black Miss America, despite TV shows such as Bill Cosby's, feelings 
of racism don't seem to be eradicated. People are segregated, so they're still 
basically prejudiced. That may change with the next generation, but not with 
these kids. The polls show they still have the same attitudes as their parents. 
</P>
<P>
There is one bright spot. I think we're going to have more black elected 
officials, more participation in the process. That's because there is a growing 
black population and a growing sophistication. As blacks gain political power, 
they can make things happen. 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: VARTAN GREGORIAN 
</P>
<P>
Gregorian is president of Brown University. A historian and former University 
of Pennsylvania provost, Gregorian revitalized the New York Public Library 
during seven years as its president. 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION IN America faces three crises during the 1990s: for one, a shortage 
of 1.1 million high school and elementary school teachers and of 500,000 
professors. So where is our seed corn? And who will educate the educators? 
Second, 23 million to 30 million Americans are functionally illiterate. We also 
face a third crisis: the shortage of skilled labor, due to demographic factors; 
the decline of the birthrate, and high school dropouts, especially in the inner 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Related to all of this is that in this country we don't have a gestalt approach 
to education. There is a great lack of philosophical, educational, 
administrative and organizational unity. As a result, the colleges and the 
universities are expected to solve and resolve the neglect and malpreparation 
of our high school students. More and more, the first two years of college 
resemble the last two years of high school. 
</P>
<P>
During the '90s, our educational issues will be compounded by social issues: 
poverty, the breakdown of families and the ravage of drugs. Unless we're able 
to solve the economic and social issues simultaneously, we will have an 
underclass that will drag America down economically. As Europe and Asia become 
strong, we will no longer be able to draw skilled immigrants -- only the 
unskilled, compounding the problem of educating the waves of them coming in. 
</P>
<P>
We have to revitalize our schools, not just give speeches. It's going to 
require a massive infusion of funds for laboratories and the teaching of math 
and science. We must join our forces and faculties to fight the nation's No. 1 
crisis. Fortress America will not be a fortress if our foundations are 
corroding. 
</P>
<P>
ART: RICHARD KOSHALEK 
</P>
<P>
Koshalek has been director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles 
since 1983, after having served as its deputy director and chief curator. 
</P>
<P>
THE CASCADE OF change in the 1980s will continue into the '90s. To manage such 
change is going to be the major problem confronting cultural institutions, 
whether they be MOCA, a theater, a concert hall or a dance company. The most 
important issue confronting museums will be developing broad-based educational 
programs that will lead visitors to a more sensitive understanding and 
appreciation of the arts. 
</P>
<P>
The increasing valuation of works of art is going to have an effect on museums, 
especially museums of contemporary art. The art market is so competitive and so 
inflated with regard to artists competing internationally that these museums 
will have to be more flexible. They can't always have the well-known works, so 
they will have to look for other sources. We might see greater interest in the 
work of artists working within the region a museum is associated with, such as 
the light-and-space artists working in California, and a greater emphasis by 
museums in acquiring the work of emerging and under-recognized artists. The art 
market will continue to move higher in very select areas and in the work of 
certain artists, but, overall, I see a leveling off of valuation increases 
throughout the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Museums will be more international in their outlook. There will have to be a 
greater interconnecting of artists between the institutions, exchange programs 
with museums in Japan and South America, not just Europe. Curators from 
different continents will put together joint shows and share them. Artists will 
become more concerned about originality and will be influenced by a wide range 
of sources, such as mass communication, architecture and urban planning and new 
technologies such as video and high-resolution television. 
</P>
<P>
FOOD: JULIA CHILD 
</P>
<P>
Child has taught cooking to millions through her books and television shows. 
Her latest book is "The Way to Cook." 
</P>
<P>
WE'RE GOING through a very bad period when people don't have much information 
about their food. They're inclined to get hysterical about things. A good 
example was the scare over the use of the chemical Alar on apples. There was 
such a hysterical pitch that it clearly crippled the apple industry and 
deprived children of healthy foods. Cholesterol is another place where we're 
getting into hysteria. People don't know what all of that means. You have to 
have a certain amount of fat, and if you take too much fiber, you're going to 
get diarrhea. The point is moderation -- eating sensibly and exercising. Every 
fat calorie you eat should be a pleasure. You should know what you're doing and 
enjoy every mouthful. That's what's going to happen: We will have more sense, 
go back to the pleasures of the table in a reasonable way. I think we'll go 
back to simple foods -- baked potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
People keep saying, "I don't have time to cook." We have fast foods and all 
that sort of thing. I think that's beginning to change. People are finding it 
doesn't take so long to cook. You really need family life at home. It's much 
nicer to eat at home than at a fast-food joint. You know what you're eating. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a great improvement in supermarket produce. That availability 
will continue. The influence of immigrants on American eating habits is 
fascinating, the tremendous emergence of all those Mexican foods and others 
from South America. Chinese seems to have toned down a little bit while Thai 
has gone up. Sichuan and Japanese foods seem to be coming up. I think this will 
continue. A lot of Oriental dishes are very healthy. Of course, some people are 
afraid of raw fish. . . . 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS: JOHN F. WELCH JR. 
</P>
<P>
Welch has been chairman and chief executive officer of General Electric since 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
THE CHALLENGE for business people is to take advantage of broader, expanding 
markets. With the world so intertwined, there is very little incentive for any 
country not to work with other countries to sustain a consistent pattern of 
global growth. 
</P>
<P>
The United States grew rapidly during the '50s and '60s. There was a dramatic 
increase in the standard of living and relatively benign global competition. 
Then, in the '70s, we focused too much on how to manage all this growth. We 
lost position to Europe and Japan. The '80s were a reaction to the '70s. 
Mergers, acquisitions and leveraged buyouts were getting some of the fat out of 
the corporations -- a hardware restructuring. The U.S. became much more 
productive. 
</P>
<P>
We're going from a decade of hardware to a decade of software -- the human 
element -- as we drive to spread responsibility through companies. To win in 
the '90s, companies are going to have to increase the speed of decision making, 
the speed of bringing products to market and putting proposals together. 
Companies will move to give more responsibility, more authority and more 
freedom to individuals, asking them to use their creativity to increase 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Business won't be able to bring a product to market, build a new facility or 
complete a merger that won't take into account the impact on the environment. 
Words like recyclable will become common terms. The massive trend toward 
deregulation during the 1980s will moderate and perhaps reverse -- although not 
back to where we were. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of U.S. businesses and property by the Japanese and other 
foreign investors should lead to greater productivity here, greater taxable 
income, a higher standard of living, more jobs and yet greater investment. 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: ARTHUR M. SCHLESINGER JR. 
</P>
<P>
Schlesinger, a writer, historian and educator, is Schweitzer professor of 
humanities at City University of New York. He served as special assistant to 
President John F. Kennedy and has won Pulitzer prizes for history and 
biography. 
</P>
<P>
THE CONSERVATIVE 1980s were a re-enactment of the conservative 1950s, as the 
1950s were a re-enactment of the conservative 1920s. In similar fashion we have 
liberal periods at 30-year intervals: Theodore Roosevelt and the Progressive 
Era in 1901; Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal in the 1930s; John F. Kennedy 
and the New Frontier in the 1960s. If the rhythm holds, the national mood in 
the 1990s will be much more like the Progressive Era and the 1930s and the 
1960s than like the conservative 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
There is no mystery about the 30-year cycle. That is the span of a generation. 
People tend to be formed by the ideas that prevail when they become politically 
conscious. Kennedy touched and formed a political generation. That generation's 
time should come in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
It looks as if the tide is beginning to turn. The recent off-year elections in 
New York, New Jersey and Virginia constituted, as pollster Louis Harris put it, 
"a vote for activist government." President Bush's rhetoric on education, the 
environment, housing, day care and so on represents a clear departure from 
hard-line Reaganite conservatism. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bush's problem is that people will soon begin to see a gap between his 
rhetoric and his action. He has been reluctant in a variety of fields to 
mobilize the resources necessary to redeem his promises. I am afraid that Mr. 
Bush's "no-new-taxes" pledge is condemning the country to impotence, both at 
home and abroad. We can't repair our collapsing bridges and dams, we can't 
house the homeless, we can't improve our schools, we can't give much help to 
countries like Poland struggling toward democracy -- all because of the tax 
taboo. And polls show that Americans are quite ready to pay taxes for 
particular things they care about. We need to recognize that it is impossible 
for us to remain a great nation without paying for it. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion will turn out to be a major mistake for George Bush. Nobody is wildly 
enthusiastic about abortion. But most people feel that the choice should be 
made by the woman involved. Bush's anti-abortion stand has created special 
problems for the Republicans, who have become a coalition of aspiring 
free-enterprisers, who believe in personal liberty, and evangelical zealots, 
who believe in enforcing morality. The Bush line will make it harder for 
suburbanites and yuppies to vote Republican in the future. 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: MARTIN E. MARTY 
</P>
<P>
Marty, professor of church history at the University of Chicago, is the author 
of "Pilgrims in Their Own Land: 500 Years of Religion in America." 
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN CHURCHES are very busy adjusting to change. Conservative religion in 
America was galvanized by the image of the Soviet Union as the "evil empire." 
Now the revival of Jewish and Christian faiths in Russia and the relative 
increase of freedom in other East European nations are confusing and liberating 
all at once. Meanwhile, the real dynamism in Christianity is in the southern 
world -- Latin America, Asia, Malaysia. The contest is between Christianity and 
Islam in some of those places, while in Latin America it is between Protestants 
and Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
Catholicism will be marked by the shortage of priests and nuns and the 
continuing failure of many American Catholics to pay attention to the church on 
such issues as birth control. Nevertheless, Catholicism will remain America's 
largest religious bloc. 
</P>
<P>
As for conservative Protestants, the TV evangelists and the scandals in the 
movement have led the serious ones to see they have to go back to basics, not 
be so flamboyant and worldly. 
</P>
<P>
American Jews on one hand are participating in a widespread recovery of 
tradition, but at the same time many are less ready to fashion their identity 
in relation to Israel. The debate over who is a Jew hurt the majority of 
American religious Jews badly. The response by Israel to the intifada has 
created some conscience problems. Toward the end of the '90s we'll be getting 
close to having as many Muslims as Jews in this country, so we'll no longer be 
a WASP or Judeo-Christian nation. 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: KENNETH T. SHINE 
</P>
<P>
Shine has been dean of UCLA's School of Medicine since 1986. He is a 
cardiologist and former president of the American Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
WE'RE ALMOST certain to see fundamental changes in the way health care is 
financed. The rate of growth in health-care costs demands some kind of 
solution. Both the elderly and the corporate communities will be pushing for 
some kind of basic health insurance that will include providing health care for 
the poor and uninsured. The biggest problem we have is making health care 
available to the uninsured. Five million Californians are uninsured. Two-thirds 
of those are people who work and don't have adequate insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Scientifically, I think the most exciting development in the '90s will be the 
capacity to match the genome, the genetic structure of the human body. If the 
genetic code for humans can be unraveled, we could eliminate specific genetic 
abnormalities. By the end of the decade, I would anticipate that one could 
identify perhaps 10,000 genes in a newborn or in an adult. This will allow the 
identification of predisposition to a variety of diseases and disorders. It 
would be possible to determine whether someone is at risk for diabetes, 
hypertension or a variety of things. 
</P>
<P>
And it is very likely that by the end of the '90s there will be some genetic 
treatment -- gene therapy. But that's going to mean that the '90s will also be 
a time of greater concern about ethics, not only in genetic therapy but also in 
the area of health care and what is appropriate treatment. 
</P>
<P>
It's possible genetic therapy could be useful in the treatment of cancer and 
AIDS, but it won't start there. It will start with a specific disorder where 
there is a known single genetic defect. 
</P>
<P>
One exciting area is the expanding knowledge of cancer through the genetic 
regulation of oncogenes, the genes identified as causing cancer in humans. This 
is particularly exciting in offering a promise for prevention as well as 
treatment for cancer. This includes a better understanding of the way 
environmental agents -- some of the toxins we are exposed to -- alter genetic 
regulation and therefore predispose a person to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
As a cardiologist, I'm very excited about the expanding understanding of 
cholesterol, metabolism and the way in which fat gets deposited in blood vessel 
walls. There'll be many new ways to prevent the blockage of blood vessels by 
fat. People are living healthier life styles. Life expectancy has gone up over 
the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
There is a good chance that a successful vaccine against AIDS will be developed 
in the next decade. People are beginning to get clues to the way the virus 
behaves. It's a virus that changes its colors very frequently. There are some 
outstanding minds working on the problem, and I think they are making progress. 
</P>
<P>
FASHION: ANNA WINTOUR 
</P>
<P>
Wintour became editor of Vogue nearly a year and a half ago. A former 
editor-in-chief of British Vogue, she also has been an editor at Harper's 
Bazaar, New York magazine and American Vogue. 
</P>
<P>
IN LOOKING AHEAD to the '90s, it's important to look at what happened in the 
'80s. First of all, there was the enormous influence of fitness. Whether you're 
looking at Jane Fonda or the New York Marathon, the fitness boom has had a 
tremendous influence in terms of fabrics and ease of clothes -- whether women 
were wearing sneakers in the street, with the way women were feeling much 
better about the way their bodies look. Azzedine Alaia is kind of the king of 
stretch or body-fitness clothes -- sexy and fashionable and desirable at the 
same time. That's going to go on into the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
We first saw the power suit during the '80s. That came out of the Italian 
designers, kind of an aggressive look; women in the workplace. I think that was 
very important in the '80s. Another thing: It was the decade of black. 
Everywhere you went you saw women in black, a sea of black. We saw the enormous 
influence Karl Lagerfeld had at Chanel; he made women more approachable, 
feminine, attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to the '90s -- to next season, at least -- I think we'll see a 
move away from this power dressing, the aggressive look. The word I'm hearing 
is soft. Women want to look more feminine, prettier; less of a uniform 
approach, more of a personal style. At the same time, the athletic, more 
relaxed approach is going to be very important. In the most recent collections, 
we saw very chic jackets thrown over a kind of bicycling-jogging suit. And I 
think we're going to see the emergence of very young designers such as Isaac 
Misrahi and Marc Jacobs and Michael Kors, which is great for my profession. We 
haven't had a group of new designers for a while. This would give us an 
injection.

SPORTS: HARRY EDWARDS 
</P>
<P>
Sports sociologist Edwards is a professor at UC Berkeley and a consultant to 
Major League Baseball assigned to help bring nonwhites into coaching and 
management. He is also a consultant to the San Francisco 49ers and the Golden 
State Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
COMMERCIALISM IS going to be the dominant force in athletics during the 1990s. 
We have a situation where, owing to the money available, the number of Major 
League Baseball regular-season games telecast on network television have 
dropped to 16 for the coming year. Everything else is going to be on pay cable. 
That will virtually eliminate access to live baseball for vast segments of the 
population, including those segments that have provided tremendous player 
personnel resources. The rural poor white kids and the inner-city black kids -- 
the (future) Rickey Hendersons, the Frank Robinsons, the Vada Pinsons -- are 
not going to have access. The time is long past when kids could go peer through 
a knothole in the fence and watch their heroes. Eliminating that access is 
eventually going to hurt baseball because these are the athletes of the future. 
</P>
<P>
We can expect a tremendous influx of foreign athletes with the growing 
internationalization of sports, thanks to the satellites. The attractiveness of 
bringing in foreign athletes who will be heroes for foreign markets is probably 
going to be very difficult to ignore. This means tens of millions of new fans, 
opening a tremendous market for sports paraphernalia. Right now, if you look at 
the NBA, Africa is represented. Russia is represented. Czechoslovakia is 
represented. Yugoslavia is represented. Growing internationalization could 
erode the tradition of American sports and the involvement of the typical 
American fans who find sports heroes appealing because they can identify with 
them. Now they've got to break through all sorts of cultural barriers. They 
probably can't even pronounce the name of Sarunas Marciulionis, who is on the 
Warriors roster and is the first Russian to play in the NBA. So commercialism 
will remove a degree of identification with the players for the fans here at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Satellite communications is going to bring more sports from more places than we 
have ever experienced into the American living room. We are going to have to 
come to grips with the fact that sports can reach a saturation point. Last 
basketball season, on a Saturday afternoon, I turned on my satellite and had 
access to 13 basketball games within a five-hour period. I watched a little bit 
of each of them. As one got boring, I switched to something else. At the end, I 
not only didn't know who had won, I didn't know who had played whom. And I was 
bored by most of it. More is not necessarily better. 
</P>

SCIENCE: RICHARD C. ATKINSON 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson, the chancellor of UC San Diego, is president of the American Assn. 
for the Advancement of Science and former director of the National Science 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
WE ARE GOING TO have a tremendous shortfall of scientists as we move toward the 
21st Century. If corrective actions are not taken immediately, by early next 
century the annual supply of Ph.Ds in this country will be about 10,500 -- 
versus a demand for about 18,000. This will dramatically affect our ability to 
maintain our scientific leadership and economic capabilities. That's the 
overriding issue that relates to the health of American science, whether we're 
going to attract the talent to keep the enterprise rolling. Too many young 
people are going off to law school and MBA programs. Or they get bachelor's 
degrees and then get recruited by industry without getting Ph.Ds. We pay such 
high salaries in fields such as computer science and the like that these people 
aren't willing to stay on for the Ph.Ds. This will be a problem even if the 
shrinking defense budget causes fewer scientists to gravitate toward defense 
research. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of science itself, on every front there are simply spectacular 
developments. What's happening in the neurosciences is absolutely 
mind-boggling. Information that's being accumulated about the nature of the 
neuron and the molecular processes involved in neurotransmission is going to 
open up a totally new view of the nature of the human mind and of psychological 
issues. Every psychological mood and condition will probably relate to some 
aspect of the transmitters, allowing us to research and study every facet of an 
individual's personality. 
</P>
<P>
Molecular and cellular biology is simply revolutionary in terms of its impact 
on medicine. Our neurosurgeons at UCSD, for example, are anticipating 
implanting into the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease genes that would 
generate an increased level of certain neurotransmitters that we believe are 
related to the disease. There's no question that this can happen during the 
coming decade. 
</P>
<P>
Things are rolling at such a fast rate that to make predictions is very 
difficult. It's clear that in fields such as physics, the superconducting 
supercollider will be a major scientific instrument. Also, I think there's a 
renewed interest in nuclear fusion as a source of energy. 
</P>
<P>
Then you've got this whole development of new techniques for visual imaging -- 
the ability, through nuclear magnetic resonance and other procedures, to 
literally image the structure of a molecule or something even smaller. We can 
image the activities of the brain. In physics and chemistry, in the 
neurosciences, billions and billions of observations can be put together by a 
computer to provide images. We can literally see the structure of particular 
molecules, the form they are and why they interact the way they do. If we can 
understand the structure of a molecule, we can create chemicals that mimic the 
structures found in the body. 
</P>
<P>
When the space telescope gets up there next spring, we may find ourselves with 
a completely new view of the universe. It will have the capacity to see farther 
and in more detail than we've ever been able to before. Everywhere along the 
way the excitement is spectacular.

WORLD AFFAIRS: WARREN CHRISTOPHER 
</P>
<P>
Christopher is chairman of the L.A. law firm of O'Melveny &amp; Myers. As 
deputy secretary of state in the Carter Administration, he was chief negotiator 
in freeing the U.S. hostages in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
THE UNITED STATES will have to develop a whole new strategy for a dramatically 
changed world. With the diminished burden of the heavy cost of armaments, we 
have a chance to address a new agenda -- and just in the nick of time. Because 
of that easing of arms costs, we are likely during the coming decade to have an 
opportunity to concentrate on environmental and economic issues to a degree 
that has not been possible in the past. This can lead to a better life for the 
disadvantaged here as well as elsewhere in the world. That's a pretty 
optimistic scenario, but I hope that it turns out to be true. 
</P>
<P>
For 40 years, our foreign policy has been dominated by fear of the Soviet Union 
and the strategy to curb its expansion. Now we are emerging from a bipolar 
world to confront a more complex but encouraging set of relationships. I think 
we are in for a dramatic change in our relationship with the Soviet Union. If 
you look down the long corridors of history, there is no fundamental reason 
that we cannot have better relations. In the '90s, some other power may arise 
as our principal adversary, probably a Pacific power -- China or Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and the end of the Cold War have changed the scene. While some 
Americans yearn for the simplicity of a bipolar world and urge that we cling to 
an obsolete strategy, we must not yield to nostalgia. Rather we must get about 
the task of developing a new strategy. The United States and Soviet Union are 
certainly not allies and not even friends in the old-fashioned sense. But we 
have passed the point where any Soviet advancement is tantamount to a U.S. 
setback. There may be setbacks, but now, increasingly often, we recognize a 
mutuality of interest in dealing with issues. Both conventional and 
nuclear-arms-control agreements are feasible to a degree previously only 
dreamed about. Clearly, the '90s will see major agreements, both in the nuclear 
and conventional arms fields. 
</P>
<P>
 In Eastern Europe, we should help each of the nations to achieve emancipation 
without expecting that they will join our bloc. Austria and Finland are 
promising "neutral" models, and we should resist the temptation to achieve the 
moon. We may find that we can work together with the Soviets in addressing such 
regional problems as Angola, Cambodia and Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
As we replace our preoccupation with Soviet containment, we must persuade other 
nationsto do the same. Some of those nations are painfully poor and are focused 
on short-range needs. How do we convince them that they must take steps to 
prevent destruction of the environment through global warming and 
deforestation? How do we compete in a world where we are no longer dominant and 
where threats of protectionism are pervasive? Multilateral diplomacy with all 
its frustrations is the most promising avenue to cope with these cosmic and 
urgent problems. It is a new world -- promising, but full of daunting risks. 
</P>
<P>
TRENDS: 
</P>
<P>
Popcorn, born Faith Plotkin, is founder of the Manhattan-based marketing and 
trend analysis firm BrainReserve. She advises corporations about developments 
likely to affect the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
WE'RE LOOKING at an era we call the "cleanup decade." We're going to be paying 
back for the sins of the '80s. We're going to have to clean up the economy, the 
ecology, education and ethics. We're glutted out. We've spent too much, 
produced too much garbage and lied too much. There's a relief in the fact that 
it's going to catch up with us. People are going to pare down and become more 
conservative about family stability, value for the dollar and so on. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons are both economic and emotional. People are sick of the glut and 
the glitz. They want their cars to last 10 years. They want to be in their 
houses for 50 years. They want their kids to grow up straight. They're tired of 
drugs and the threat of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest thing will be the consciousness that changes from me to thee. The 
'80s were all about me and what I needed, and money, money, money. The '90s 
will be about children and community and concern for the planet and concern for 
people of China and Russia. Marketing will have to shift to demonstrate an 
ethical stance. One current example is Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream; they have a 
flavor called Amazon Rain Forest Crunch, and proceeds from it go toward 
conservation in South America. 
</P>
<P>
That's being optimistic, but we're going to have to do with a lot less. There 
is a major gap between the haves and the have-nots, and the haves are going to 
have to start taking care of and responsibility for the have-nots.

ROBERT HUTCHINS AS A DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTION; 
</P>
<P>
UNSEASONABLE TRUTHS: THE LIFE OF ROBERT MAYNARD HUTCHINS BY HARRY S. ASHMORE 
(LITTLE, BROWN: $27.50; 616 PP.; 0-316-05396-1) 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Maynard Hutchins was one of those larger-than-life men of vision about 
whom Americans like to boast in retrospect, but who in life receive more than 
their share of misunderstanding, criticism and indeed vituperation from their 
fellow-citizens. Hutchins, to be sure, gave at least as good as he got. His 
long and extraordinarily distinguished career as one of America's great 
educators began at age 24 as secretary of the Yale Corp., continued through two 
trail-blazing decades as president of the University of Chicago and ended as 
president of the ever controversial Center for the Study of Democratic 
Institutions in Santa Barbara. Notably reluctant to suffer fools (or opponents) 
gladly, Hutchins taught and fought all his life for the idea of a questing but 
disciplined liberal-arts education and its by-product -- an informed 
intellectual community. Both, he felt, were vital to the health of American 
democracy. Many of Hutchins' ideals, from civil rights to the international 
rule of the law, ran against the entrenched conventional wisdom of his time, in 
the '40s and '50s, but they have been tested and proven since. 
</P>
<P>
The author of "Unseasonable Truths," Harry Ashmore, was himself a friend and 
associate of Hutchins, as the long-time executive vice president at the Center 
in Santa Barbara. He is understandably impressed by his subject -- although it 
would be hard to find a biographer who would not be, faced with this man's 
achievements. Ashmore gives Hutchins' many opponents equal time, however 
(although sometimes just barely), and tells Hutchins' complex story fluently 
and well. This is a badly needed book -- comprising as it does a fascinating 
sub-chapter on America's intellectual history. (Its considerable length is 
justified by the broad spectrum of Hutchins' interests and involvements, not to 
mention the copious quotes from his subject, who on his own could have supplied 
the bulk of a second Bartlett's Familiar Quotations.) 
</P>
<P>
Hutchins was born just before the turn of the century. He was graduated from 
Yale (Class of '21) with two other Americans of singular mold, William Benton 
and Henry Robinson Luce. All three were ministers' sons. All three, although 
their interpretations of this were different, maintained a lifelong devotion to 
certain values of conscience, integrity and plain speaking that they had 
learned in the Puritan parsonage. Benton, after starting a formidable 
advertising agency, Benton &amp; Bowles, went on to become the chairman and 
guiding genius of Encylopaedia Britannica, where Hutchins ended up as chairman 
of the board of editors. Luce, of course, was the proprietor of Time, Inc., and 
his magazines' most critical editor. The relationship among them was uneasy, 
because it was almost inevitably competitive. While Benton and Luce tended to 
look askance at Hutchins as a man who probably couldn't and shouldn't ever meet 
a payroll, Hutchins looked archly at them from his academic pedestal as 
something better than useful Philistines, although often not much better. 
Nonetheless, their friendships remained firm. The story of the three is a 
capsule of the American Century as it might have turned out. 
</P>
<P>
At Yale, Hutchins was almost the epitome of the bright and handsome young man 
his seniors like to promote. But he was not one to curry favor or compromise, 
either with his ideals or his promoters. At age 29, the brand-new dean of the 
Yale Law School, he brashly set out to inject some empirical social science 
into the stiff legal curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
When he became president of the University of Chicago in 1929, at the ripe age 
of 30, he wasted little time in shaking the tree there, as he pointed the 
university toward his ideal of a liberal education. He saw this as a prescribed 
set of courses in the humanities, the natural sciences, history and philosophy 
over a two-year period (preferably preceded by a preparatory two years of 
similar courses in high school), after which the student would receive the BA 
degree. Then -- but only then -- would students go on to various forms of 
specialized education. Scouring the electives of most academic institutions, 
students at Hutchins' college were to study from the original texts and 
participate in extensive discussions of the ideas involved -- as junior 
humanists -- before going on to their various work specialties. Predictably, 
Hutchins was opposed fang-and-claw by most of Chicago's turf-guarding faculty. 
He managed to import some significant new academic talent to support him. Yet 
in 22 years, he never quite got his reforms through. He did succeed in setting 
a standard of academic excellence and a liberal-arts tradition at Chicago that 
his foes were unable to stifle. Above all, he gave us the abiding example of a 
university president who was not afraid to educate and to exercise leadership. 
These qualities are in short supply these days, among the cautious committeemen 
and women who putter away at university presidencies. 
</P>
<P>
A significant byproduct of Hutchins' principate at Chicago was the acquisition 
of Encyclopaedia Britannica by Hutchins' friend Benton, bought after the 
University of Chicago's timid trustees refused to accept it as a gift. While 
Benton turned E. B. into a puissant money-maker, Hutchins, as chairman of the 
board of editors, became its editorial conscience and guide. He presided over 
the publication of "Great Books of the Western World" and, ultimately, the 
memorable 15th edition of Britannica in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
By 1951, however, Hutchins had headed West from Chicago to California, where he 
remained until his death in 1977. He first set up shop in Pasadena as associate 
director of the newly formed Ford Foundation. But it took only a few years to 
put a great void of distance between Ford's nervous board and Hutchins' 
ambitious plans to re-state the premises of American democratic dialogue, 
particularly against the right-wing vigilantism of the McCarthy era. In 1959, 
Hutchins retreated to Santa Barbara, where he established the hilltop center as 
a place for enlightened dialogue on the ideas behind the various political and 
social issues facing the country -- a kind of "early warning system" for 
democracy, as he often put it. Here he gathered about him a group of prominent 
Amerian scholars and thinkers with widely different backgrounds and 
specialties. These center fellows would meet several times a week to discuss 
specific topics--from Constitutional freedoms to the multinational corporation 
-- a kind of intellectual round table. Although some of Hutchins' intellectual 
knights were more errant than others, these talks in the center's heyday could 
be stimulating and provocative. They were relayed on tape and in print, to a 
national audience. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the dialogues grew to a wider scale, as with the memorable "Pacem in 
Terris" conference in New York in 1965, where the center gathered about 2,000 
of the world's prominent and concerned people to ponder the issues of war and 
peace and world governance, at the height of the Cold War. Sometimes they 
degenerated into trivial academic name-calling, as indeed happened all too 
often in the faction-ridden last days of the center. Yet for those of us who 
took part in such meetings, the thing we remember best was the magisterial 
presiding of Bob Hutchins, always questioning, always searching for new ways to 
keep the ideas behind the American debate from getting lost in the invective. 
Unlike most idealists, Hutchins was never boring, with his high irony, 
self-deprecatory wit and courtly invitation to outrageous thought. The issues 
he raised remain more pertinent than ever today -- the goals and shape of 
American education not least among them.

STORYTELLERS: NEW IN JANUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN STABINER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Old traditions, and expectations, die hard, or so it seems. In the eight weeks 
since our daughter was born (so many pink outfits, so little time), we have 
learned some stark lessons about girls and boys, even though there was a 
rumored truce in the war between the sexes. Hah. Girls still get clothes and 
cuddly toys; boys get Fisher-Price Activity Centers and similar paraphernalia, 
designed to develop the brains they will so clearly need as they forge careers. 
</P>
<P>
So it was with particular interest that I cracked the binding on Erica Jong's 
latest, Any Woman's Blues (Harper &amp; Row: $18.95; 384 pp.), which promises a 
look at women in the 1990s -- a happy glimpse, according to the blurbs, a light 
at the end of the sex-, drug-, and alcohol-sodden tunnel. An answer to the 
question, not of what women want, but of how to get it. Good Housekeeping may 
tout the new traditionalist (a polite euphemism for moms who can afford to stop 
working and find happiness at home), but surely Jong would have something 
smarter to say about the modern woman. 
</P>
<P>
Uh-huh. Jong deftly plays both ends against the middle (which is one of the few 
sexual positions her heroine doesn't attempt) in this X-rated morality tale. 
Leila Sand is a wine-guzzling, dope-smoking painter obsessed with a younger 
man, Darton, whom she calls Dart for all the obviously phallic reasons. He, of 
course, loves the living daylights out of her and then leaves her lonely. But 
the author knows that a whole novel about Leila after she straightens up would 
be, well, dull as dry toast. So she strategically places her heroine's 
enlightenment at the back of the book, after hundreds of voyeuristic pages that 
describe all the despicable behaviors she has to leave behind. The key to 
feminine happiness is still the love of a good man, and the way to get that man 
is to clean up one's act a bit -- having read all the dirty parts first -- 
which sounds like the 1950s as much as the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
At least Judith Michael's A Ruling Passion (Poseidon Press: $19.95; 574 pp.) is 
unabashed about its old-style values. Valerie Sterling is your basic 
directionless socialite when her husband's private plane goes down, killing him 
and leaving Valerie and three other passengers stranded at an isolated, icy 
lake. But she gamely sets off in her sable coat, matching sable hat and 
cashmere scarf and saves everyone's life, only to learn that her dear, departed 
husband managed to squander her millions before he died. The fur's about all 
she has left. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the cruel specter of poverty, Valerie digs deep within herself and 
finds the drive she has always lacked -- which propels her right into the arms 
of an ex-flame, and right into an investigation of his ex-wife's television 
ministry. It's an idyllic, if idealized, scenario, based on the delightful 
double-whammy notion that a good woman always gets a second chance in life and 
justice ultimately prevails -- which certainly will be news to the women out 
there who are trying to rewrite their personal histories. 
</P>
<P>
First novelist Teresa de Luca does a much better job with a similarly hackneyed 
story in A Distant Thunder (William Morrow: $19.95; 512 pp.). It's still the 
same old story, a fight for love and glory, a case of do or die, but this time 
done with some energy. Dolly Carrasquez, like so many other romantic heroines, 
suffers from severe myopia where men are concerned. She looks right past 
British journalist Jack Curtis and runs off to Spain to wed a soldier. Soon 
widowed, thanks to the Spanish Civil War, she turns to a radical worker -- but 
the reader knows that Jack has not forgotten her in Spain, and eventually the 
second wrong beau does what a friend of mine calls the mortal-coil shuffle-off, 
leaving Dolly free to do the right thing. It's a painless way to learn some 
Spanish Civil War history. 
</P>
<P>
So there it is. What moral can I extract for a baby girl? That love conquers 
all, a decent, if impractical sentiment that will get her nowhere with her 
creditors or co-workers? That women are doomed to dumbness until they're well 
into their 30s? Thanks, but no thanks. This is not the kind of bedtime stories 
she should hear. Think I'll go out and buy her some boy-toys instead.

The Vikings hold a curious fascination for modern audiences, but popular 
fiction writers and Hollywood film makers have offered romanticized, sanitized 
versions of the raiders who terrorized Medieval Europe. In this scrupulously 
researched historical novel, Swedish author Jan Fridegard (1897-1968) depicts 
the gritty struggle for existence that comprised Viking life in the early 9th 
Century. The story focuses not on a handsome, burly, blond warrior but on 
Holme, the brooding, dark-haired thrall of a petty chieftain. Fridegard 
interweaves Holme's struggle to win freedom for himself and his wife with the 
conflict between Scandinavian paganism and the Christianity preached by the 
emissaries of Louis the Pious. Robert Bjork's crisp translation represents the 
first time Fridegard's highly respected "Holme" trilogy has been available to 
English readers. "Land of Wooden Gods" is the first volume; his translations of 
the second and third books, "Sacred Smoke" and "People of the Dawn," will be 
issued in early 1990.

LANDSCAPES OF A NEW LAND: FICTION BY LATIN AMERICAN WOMEN BY MARJORIE AGOSIN

"Every day my husband contradicts the version in the mirror. I look at myself 
in it and he insists that I perceive myself wrongly. I am not, in truth, the 
shadows, the wrinkles with which I see myself. Like my father, he too is 
responsible for my eternal youth. . . . . . . at the end of the day I no longer 
know how old I am." (from "I Love My Husband.") 
</P>
<P>
Included among the 21 works in "Landscapes of a New Land: Fiction by Latin 
American Women," this short first-person narrative by Nelida Pinon, is an 
ironic statement on the condition of women in a male-dominant society. The 
narrator is not simply describing a conjugal situation unique to a 
stereotypical "Macho" Latin American society. Instead, "I Love My Husband" is a 
commentary on the dependent relationship that women have withstood, not only in 
marriage but in all social constructs in traditional Western society. A woman 
perceives herself through the male mirrors that surround her throughout her 
life. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, this story exemplifies the alternative perspective that this 
collection of short narratives offers, not only about the role of women writers 
in Latin America, but of Latin American reality itself. Emerging at a time in 
which the prevailing representation of that reality has been almost entirely in 
the hands of male writers such as Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, 
Mario Vargas Llosa, and Manuel Puig, the main objective of this collection, 
edited by Marjorie Agosin, herself a fiction writer, is to allow the women to 
speak for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Writing as an act, is an affirmation of a historical presence and is 
simultaneously, a "representation" of cultural and intellectual traditions. If 
historical revisionism has been the apex of the Latin American literary "Boom," 
it should be evident that the power inherent in the act of writing is a 
contemporary concern among women writers such as Luisa Valenzuela, Elena 
Poniatowska, Margo Glantz, Nelida Pinon and Cristina Peri Rossi. After all, the 
traditional domination of the male voice in narrative discourse has necessarily 
precluded that female presence is first, determined by the male, and second, 
"represented" by him. Woman's accessibility to writing whether through glyph or 
visual image constitutes an alternative view of a cultural reality. 
</P>
<P>
According to Agosin, the international recognition accorded Chilean writer 
Maria Luisa Bombal in the 1970s was responsible for the emergence of a new 
generation of writers headed by Luisa Valenzuela. They include along with those 
mentioned above, lesser-known writers such as Yolanda Bedregal, Lygia Fagundes 
Telles, Helena Araujo, Alicia Steinberg, Carmen Naranjo, Laura Riesco, and 
Elvira Orphee, along with the more-familiar Marta Brunet and Clarice Lispector. 
Diverse and divergent, their voices range from internal monologues to 
neo-realistic narratives and experimental fragments. These works are, according 
to Agosin, "the images and voices that reflect the eclectic nature and energy 
of these women" and the world they construct reflects the pathos and 
insecurities comcomitant with the search for self affirmation. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, while this collection is a valuable contribution to the comprehension of 
the totality of contemporary Latin American literature, there are some puzzling 
omissions as well as some questions. Where are the works or references to Lydia 
Cabrera, Silvina Bullrich, Teresa de la Parra or Elena Garro, all of whom have 
been overshadowed by their male contemporaries despite their distinguished 
literary contributions? Why is Ocampo, who along with her sister Victoria, her 
husband Adolfo Bioy Casares and their friend Jorge Luis Borges founded the 
group and literary magazine Sur, as well as the publishing house Editorial 
Sudamericana simply dismissed as a "precursor to the fantastical literature of 
her country." 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite these critical questions as well as uneven translations, 
"Landscapes of a New Land" awakens an awareness not only of the rich 
contribution that women writers have made to Latin American literary 
topography, but to the partial vision of that landscape that the dominant male 
narrators have presented to the North American reader up to now. It marks an 
important point of departure for further exploration.

IN MEMORIAM: MAY SWENSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The poet May Swenson died on Dec. 4, 1989, at age 70. One of her last 
published works will appear in WEST/WORD 2, January, 1990, her response to a 
set of four questions on poetry put to her, as to a large number of other 
American poets, by editor Austin Straus. In lieu of other memorial, we publish 
her response below to the last of those questions: Does the act of writing a 
poem ever feel forced? 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Force can't make a poem for me. 
</P>
<P>
I am an old poet now. My first book was published over thirty years ago, and 
recognition came late. This makes no difference to the quality of the work, or 
to how long it will last. But, for me quantity diminishes with age, with 
increasing complexities of daily life, decreasing energies both physical and 
mental. Yes, one becomes wiser, but that's not good for making poetry. Knowing, 
seeing through everything, produces the cynic, the intellectualizer. The best 
poetry has its roots in the subconscious to a great degree. Youth, naivete, 
reliance on instinct more than learning and method, a sense of freedom and 
play, even trust in randomness is necessary to the making of a poem, and if 
this ceases to happen often in the poet, s/he either produces less often or 
tries to force. Still I visualize a break-through in these, my late years, a 
lucky (and magical) period of peace, simplicity, ideal inner and outer weather, 
a clean slate away from petty obligations and complications, a surge of power 
and self-belief, a sudden ability to make use of my hoard of experiences in the 
creation of a great poem. I visualize this ecstasy.

JAPANESE FLOWER ARRANGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE TRADITIONAL EUROPEAN or American recipe for floral design is fairly simple: 
Buy or pick some posies, plunk them into a vase, move them around a little and 
maybe add some greenery. Depending on the colors and varieties of flowers and 
the type of container, this can be as simple as a daisy in a beer bottle or as 
elaborate as those 7-foot multifloral behemoths in some nouvelle restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
An integral part of holidays and other festivities since ancient times, flowers 
are not merely decorative. Greeks and Romans worked up wreaths and garlands to 
mark victories, later Europeans danced around Maypoles, and even today no 
self-respecting bride would exchange vows without flowers. Whether a 
celebration of the seasons or an appreciation of nature's beauty, flower 
arranging is more popular today than ever before. Although fresh flowers are 
still the overwhelming favorite, dried and silk flowers are blooming in more 
and more places. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the Europeans' exuberance, Japanese flower arranging, or 
Ikebana, is more sculptural. Texture and overall shape, such as the triangle or 
three-point design, are important, and variations of styles are distinct 
categories -- cascading Moribana, for instance, or trailing informal Seika. A 
perfect flower or two, an upright stalk, a fleshy leaf, a low-slung ceramic pot 
and the essential pin holder (for supporting leaves and blooms) are the usual 
raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing casual about these restrained arrangements; they clearly 
announce the time, training and art involved. In Japan, flower arranging was 
originally practiced only by priests and nobles; like the tea ceremony, sand 
painting and incense burning, flower arranging remains a ritual layered with 
meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 Instructors in many kinds of flower arranging are plentiful in Southern 
California. Kayoko Maekawa teaches Sangetsu flower arranging at MOA (through 
UCLA Extension); she describes Sangetsu as emphasizing "the nature of the 
plants, bringing out their own beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese and other kinds of flower-arranging classes are frequently offered by 
the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum in Arcadia (Ikebana -- Japanese 
Flower Arranging starts Jan. 12) and South Coast Botanic Garden in Palos Verdes 
Peninsula; a course titled Flower Design and Arranging is offered by 
Everywoman's Village in Van Nuys; Silk and Dried-Flower Arranging for All 
Seasons is available at Piecemakers Country Store in Costa Mesa, and The Art of 
Silk Floral Design is offered by The Learning Tree in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Shunsui Kamimura in San Pedro regularly schedules classes, as does the Elva 
May Florist School in Fullerton (the latter a $1,250 Monday-through-Friday 
four- week program for would-be commercial florists). 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the many gorgeous and useful books on flower arranging include "The 
Book of Fresh Flowers," by Malcolm Hillier (Simon and Schuster); "Designing 
With Flowers," by Tricia Guild (Crown Publishers); "Ikebana," by Haru 
Reischauer (out of print), and "Flower Arrangement the Ikebana Way," by Minobu 
Ohi, et. al., edited and prefaced by Dr. William C. Steere (C. E. Tuttle).

AEROSPACE: DEFENSE CUTBACKS WILL HIT THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ECONOMY HARD. BUT 
THE SUFFERING ISN'T LIKELY TO BE AS GREAT AS IT WAS 20 YEARS AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY ANDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1977 film "Fun With Dick and Jane," George Segal and Jane Fonda played a 
husband and wife who turn to armed robbery to support their comfortable 
Southern California suburban life style after he is laid off as an aerospace 
engineer and cannot find work. 
</P>
<P>
It was an exaggeration, of course, but the black comedy did reflect the pain 
and dislocation then occurring in the Southland's aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
The impending end of the Vietnam War, coupled with completion of the Apollo 
moon-landing program, wiped out more than 100,000 Southern California jobs 
between 1970 and 1973, and many workers had trouble finding comparable 
employment outside the defense or space areas. Some engineers became janitors, 
surplus defense plants became ghostly federal warehouses and the regional 
economy went into a bad recession. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the Cold War seems to be ending and the Reagan-era defense buildup is 
fading, some worry that another economic tailspin may be lurking -- perhaps 
even worse than that of nearly 20 years ago. There is strong evidence that a 
slump has already begun: An estimated 5,000 aerospace jobs in Southern 
California were eliminated last year, and 9,000 more have been lopped off this 
year. All forecasts are for job losses of that magnitude or greater to continue 
well into the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
What is clear is that the local economy will take a wallop over the next five 
years as defense budgets shrink, major weapons projects end and thousands of 
aerospace workers lose their jobs. That will have spillover effects on 
everything from charitable contributions to municipal tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, many experts are crossing their fingers, arguing that the 
Southland economy is vastly larger and more diversified than it was and 
therefore should weather the difficult times faced by its huge defense segment 
with little lasting damage. 
</P>
<P>
Given the region's strong job market and expanding economy in most other 
sectors, the dislocation coming in defense may be minimized, most experts 
believe, and most workers will be able to find new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
They are especially hopeful that the booming market for commercial jets -- 
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas have huge order backlogs from the airlines that 
will last at least a decade -- will soften the blow of defense cuts. Although 
Boeing is based in Seattle, much of the subcontracting for its jetliners is 
done in Southern California, and McDonnell Douglas builds its commercial 
aircraft in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't jump to the conclusion that (laid-off defense workers) are all 
going to be working as clerks at Sears," said John Oliver Wilson, chief 
economist at Bank of America. "Unlike the 1960s, we've got demand for engineers 
and the defense companies are rushing to diversify." 
</P>
<P>
Since World War II, Southern California has had the nation's largest 
concentration of defense contractors. Its pioneering flight industry was 
quickly converted to wartime production in the early 1940s, and, in essence, it 
has never really switched back. From the region's factories and hangars have 
poured fighter planes, missiles and other armaments to fight three wars and to 
maintain the Cold War arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
According to figures compiled by the Commission on State Finance, federal 
defense spending in California hit a relative peak in 1968, representing a 
whopping 14.6% of that year's gross state product (the value of all goods and 
services produced in California). That dropped off rapidly with the end of the 
Vietnam War, hitting a low of 6.6% in 1979 before the Reagan buildup began. 
</P>
<P>
"Aerospace went into a free fall after 1968," said David Hensley, director of 
California forecasting at the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. "But it's not 
in a free fall now, and it probably won't go into one." 
</P>
<P>
Even at the peak of the 1980s defense buildup in 1986, federal defense spending 
in California amounted to just 9.6% of the gross state product -- well below 
the 1968 record. It is estimated at 8.1% for 1989, heading to 6% or less by the 
mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody seems to be expecting us to take a kick in the pants (if defense 
spending drops sharply)," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles 
Area Chamber of Commerce. "But we may already have had it since 1986, and we've 
hardly noticed." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it is easy to talk of the ability of the Southland economy to 
swallow the big defense cutbacks in the "macro" terms favored by economists. In 
that world, the regional economy is simply one big job factory and everybody 
who is let go by a defense contractor will simply find work elsewhere because 
the job market is so strong. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, however, that the defense "build-down" will hit many people and 
economic segments very hard, and it is likely that the local economy will take 
years to recover. The most likely effects: 
</P>
<P>
Many highly skilled engineers and technical workers will have a very hard time 
finding comparable work in commercial or civilian fields in Southern 
California. The Reagan-era buildup lasted almost a decade, and many of those 
who will lose their jobs have been working in highly specialized fields for 
relatively high pay. Although the Southland job market is considered robust, 
its ability to absorb thousands of skilled technical workers with considerable 
experience and hefty salary needs is highly doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, employment in the commercial aircraft programs that many are 
counting on to take up the slack of defense cuts is not likely to be expanded 
dramatically in the next few years. The commercial jet companies seem content 
at this point to increase productivity through overtime and to stretch out 
delivery schedules instead of adding new production facilities in expensive 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Although most experts predict a fairly gradual, managed decline in defense 
expenditures, it is possible that at least one or two major projects being 
built in the Southland could be wiped out soon. Among the threatened programs 
seem to be McDonnell Douglas' C-17 transport, Northrop and Lockheed's Advanced 
Tactical Fighter and Northrop's Stealth bomber. Together these programs employ 
more than 20,000 workers in Southern California. To lose one or more of them in 
the early 1990s, as seems probable, would be a devastating blow to industry 
hopes for only a gradual loss of jobs, mostly through retirements and normal 
attrition. (Last week, in fact, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was reported to 
have proposed cutting production of the C-17 from 10 planes to six next year.) 
</P>
<P>
The region's huge network of defense subcontractors, who make everything from 
electronics to fasteners, plastic devices and fabricated metal parts, is 
already hurting from the end of some projects, notably Rockwell's B-1 bomber. 
Many subcontractors are expected to have a difficult time switching to 
commercial work after years of lucrative defense contracts. Although some are 
finding success as subcontractors for the region's burgeoning high-tech and 
biotech industries, others have noticeably scaled back operations and laid off 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
The shrinkage of the defense industry here could be a body blow for the 
region's commercial and residential real estate industries. The area's 
astronomical home prices have already softened, some say in part because of the 
loss of so many high-paying aerospace jobs. And large vacancies have already 
occurred in the Los Angeles International Airport, El Segundo and South Bay 
regions, where the defense industry is concentrated. By one account, 25% of the 
office space near the airport is now vacant. 
</P>
<P>
How severe the effects of the defense downturn will be depends largely on how 
the Bush Administration decides to make the cuts and how strongly Congress 
fights reductions that will hurt local employers. The early signals from the 
White House and Defense Secretary Cheney are that a fairly rapid reduction in 
the size of the Army may occur but that the elimination of big procurement 
programs will be gradual. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think (the federal government) will make the same mistake again and 
cut defense spending sharply all at once, as they did in the early 1970s," said 
Roy Anderson, retired chairman of Lockheed, who lived through the difficult 
aerospace slump of 1968-76. "There seems to be a good understanding in 
Washington of the impact of precipitous cuts, which just launch us on a cycle 
of slump and boom." 
</P>
<P>
Southern California is less vulnerable to reductions in the size of the armed 
forces than it is to cuts in defense procurement of weapons and armaments. To 
be sure, the region has several major military installations. Largest among 
them are the San Diego and Long Beach naval facilities, the Marine base at Camp 
Pendleton and several Air Force bases. Overall, California has an estimated 
250,000 active-duty military personnel within its borders. 
</P>
<P>
But the Southland has no major Army bases, and therefore it should not suffer 
greatly as the Administration shrinks the Army. In fact, the diversity of the 
state's defense spending should provide a buffer against cutbacks in any one 
area. 
</P>
<P>
According to 1989 figures from the Commission on State Finance, federal defense 
spending in California divides up as 23% for research and development, 33% for 
procurement of weapons and armaments, 27% for civilian operations and 
maintenance of military installations, and 17% for military salaries and 
pensions. 
</P>
<P>
The severity of the downturn in Pentagon purchases of weapons and armaments 
will depend to some degree on what the government does with the money it will 
no longer spend on defense. 
</P>
<P>
"The money won't disappear into thin air," said Stephen Levy, economist and 
director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy. "It 
will be redirected, through tax cuts, deficit reduction or new government 
spending programs." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the center and the Southern California Assn. of Governments 
conducted a study to determine how the region would be affected by defense 
cutbacks. Levy said the report assumed a one-third reduction in the "real," or 
inflation-adjusted, defense budget from the 1986 level -- a much larger cut 
than most now expect in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"The scenario that would keep the most (defense workers) in their jobs in 
Southern California would be if the federal government decides to go hellbent 
for space or technology programs," Levy said. "The switch would be relatively 
painless; the employers would probably be the same." 
</P>
<P>
Any other scenario would involve a painful transition in which many workers 
might require retraining or might be forced to leave the area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
If the government decides to cut taxes or reduce the deficit instead of 
investing in new programs, he said, California's economy would also benefit in 
the broad sense from lower interest rates or increased personal income. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, the tax-cut scenario would have the least benefit and could 
produce a modest decline in the region's manufacturing job base. Even that, 
however, would not be comparable to what happened in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"The big difference is that we have a healthy economy now, unlike 1971-73. The 
Los Angeles region is running below the national unemployment rate," Levy said. 
"We ended the huge B-1 program in the last few years, but I can't even read 
that in the regional economic numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Adds B of A's Wilson: "If the defense cutbacks are spread over five or six 
years, the cuts by themselves are not sufficient to plunge the California 
economy into a recession. It would take other things to do that, such as an 
overvalued dollar hurting California exports, the closure of some Asian markets 
to our products due to political change or a policy mistake by the Federal 
Reserve to tighten monetary policy (which would hurt California's 
interest-rate-sensitive economy)." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson acknowledges, however, that "the $64 question" is how difficult the 
dislocation of former defense workers will be on Southern California, and there 
are ominous signs that it will not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
"The market for out-of-work engineers and technical people is already dismal 
and has been since the slump began two years ago," an executive recruiter in 
Los Angeles said. "This could get very bad." 
</P>
<P>
The region's manufacturing industries that have expanded greatly since the 
great aerospace slump of the early 1970s -- apparel, furniture, chemicals, 
printing and high tech, among others -- are not a good match for defense 
employees looking for work, he said. In addition, most of those industries do 
not offer nearly the salary or benefits of defense work, and that may make it 
tough for laid-off workers to maintain their current standards of living. 
</P>
<P>
Otis Booth III, executive director of the Russell Reynolds Associates executive 
recruiting firm's Los Angeles office, said he has noticed that most of the 
defense workers who have been laid off since 1986 are finding work at smaller 
"niche" companies -- often defense subcontractors that have grown larger during 
the buildup in the 1980s and now need experienced managers and technicians. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these firms still have a substantial defense backlog that will run into 
the 1990s, so these people should be secure for at least several years, Booth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The trend seems to be that as big projects end, people leave the large prime 
contractors and go to the smaller firms that still have lots of work," he said. 
He predicted that even as defense budgets shrink, the Pentagon will seek 
funding to upgrade existing weapons systems with new electronics and other 
capabilities. And that should help the smaller Southern California defense 
firms that make such devices. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, perhaps the most wrenching transition for the region will be to 
accept the realization that the defense business will no longer be the economic 
linchpin it has been since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, even without this cutback, I would not have expected much expansion 
by the defense industry in Southern California," said John Cushman, president 
of Cushman Realty Corp. of Los Angeles and an expert in regional real estate 
trends. "The industry is eyeing Texas, Nevada and Arizona for new plants, 
places where the cost of doing business is less, the tax structure is more to 
their liking and the cost of housing and utilities is cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some observers believe that the so-called negative quality-of-life 
issues swirling around Southern California -- pollution, traffic, 
overdevelopment and high housing costs -- may ironically act to cushion the 
personal blow of defense cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Said UCLA's Hensley: "You hear these complaints all the time. I suspect that 
what is keeping a lot of people here who can't afford to buy a house and who 
don't like the smog is the strong job market. They can make a good salary. Take 
that away, and why stay here?" 
</P>
<P>
So, unlike the situation in the early 1970s, when laid-off aerospace workers 
such as those in "Fun With Dick and Jane" fought to maintain their life styles 
in what seemed a much more desirable Southern California, some may now view the 
loss of a defense job as the excuse to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hearing a lot of people talking about Phoenix, Albuquerque, Portland and 
Tucson," Booth said. "The fact is that salary levels in Southern California 
manufacturing don't seem high enough any more to maintain that nice life style 
everybody talked about."

HOW DEFENSE CONTRACTORS HOPE TO COPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The defense industry is often discussed as if it were a monolithic giant, but 
it consists of an estimated 40,000 companies across the nation that differ 
widely in their involvement in the arms business. 
</P>
<P>
Although defense budgets have been dropping 2% annually since 1985 and their 
decline could accelerate during the 1990s, the market for weapons procurement 
and research still amounts to an awesome $120 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense industry in the United States does not have to be at its present 
peak size to be a very healthy, profitable, vital industry," Hughes Aircraft 
Chairman Malcolm R. Currie said. "I felt very strongly that it would be far 
better to be somewhat smaller in size and be leaner, more competitive and to be 
profitable, than to go for size alone." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the defense boom of the 1980s left many companies weaker by the end of 
the decade than they were at the start. As defense budgets drop in coming 
years, the effects will vary widely, forcing some companies into mergers or 
closure and putting others into positions of strength. Here is a look at how 
major Southern California defense prime contractors are positioned for the 
coming shakeout. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes Aircraft Co. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes Aircraft has set a goal to double its non-defense business by the end of 
the 1990s, clearly the most ambitious diversification program in the aerospace 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike past efforts by defense contractors to diversify, which in large measure 
have been business failures, the Hughes plan concentrates on extending Hughes' 
existing, fast-growing line of commercial products. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not jumping over the moon to another green pasture and hoping for 
salvation," said Currie in a recent interview. "I would be naive as hell to say 
it is easy to capitalize on (defense technology) in commercial markets. That is 
a very, very difficult transition to make. We are making that transition where 
it makes sense, where we can put one foot in front of the other carefully and 
know what we are getting into." 
</P>
<P>
One key advantage that Los Angeles-based Hughes has is three decades of 
experience in building commercial communications satellites, in which it 
remains a world leader. During the 1980s, the company moved aggressively to 
extend its involvement in communications to ground-based networks and today has 
rapidly growing earnings in providing businesses such as Holiday Inns and 
Target retail stores with private communications systems. 
</P>
<P>
Another major growth area for Hughes, a subsidiary of General Motors, will be 
in military training. A third new non-defense market will be in civilian 
air-traffic control. After losing a bid to build a massive new system for the 
United States, Hughes recently won a contract to supply a system to Canada, 
positioning the company for a major global market. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a crying need in the world today for air traffic control," Currie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1990s, Hughes could realize half its sales from non-defense 
business, up from 20% to 25% today, Currie said. The change in mix would occur 
through growth rather than loss of defense business, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes will close 1989 after having gone through a painful 6,000-worker 
reduction, prompted in part by the expectation that defense markets would 
shrink and by the company's need to bring down its historically high costs. Its 
current work force of 65,000 is down from a peak of 80,000 a few years ago, and 
its backlog is large. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel pretty good about our basic strength," Currie said. "We are not going 
to get wiped out by any one or two or three cancellations, but almost anything 
that happens affects us in one way or another because we are so broadly 
diversified. There is just no getting around that." 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell International 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell International Corp. has been perhaps the most fortunate prime military 
contractor in the nation during the past decade. It was big in defense when the 
going was good during the early years of the Reagan Administration buildup and 
has withdrawn sharply in the late 1980s when defense became far less 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Today, defense programs account for just 28% of El Segundo-based Rockwell's 
revenues, and that base does not contain any controversial programs that are at 
the forefront of the defense debate, notes company Chairman Donald R. Beall. 
</P>
<P>
"From the narrow Rockwell view, the Department of Defense business has already 
over the last several years come down considerably, much more than I would 
expect would be affected by whatever the future budget situation will be," 
Beall said. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell derives more than half of its sales from such non-government 
businesses as producing motor vehicle components, newspaper printing presses, 
industrial electronics and commercial electronics. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased to be in the position Rockwell is in to deal with the 
uncertain times ahead," Beall said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the defense budget is coming down, Beall believes that the 
company's government business will remain flat. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell is the largest contractor to the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, whose budget has long languished at around $8 billion annually 
but is now growing rapidly. In the current fiscal year, NASA's budget jumped to 
$10.9 billion from 1988's funding level of $8.9 billion. In 1991, NASA's budget 
will be $12.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which employs 35,600 workers in Southern California, down from a 
mid-1980s peak of 42,000, is building another space shuttle in Palmdale and was 
just awarded a contract to build structural pieces for what could be a fifth 
shuttle. Its rocket engine business in Canoga Park is soaring on orders for 
expendable rocket programs. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Beall said, the firm has a large number of defense 
electronics programs that are ready to go into production, systems that are 
unlikely to be cut even in the austere times ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"On balance, we are more likely to grow than to not grow," Beall said about the 
company's government business. "Overall, I don't see a major reduction in our 
Southern California work force." 
</P>
<P>
Northrop Corp. 
</P>
<P>
With about half of its sales coming from the B-2 Stealth bomber program, 
Northrop will do well if that single program does well. But the risk is that a 
cancellation of the B-2 would decapitate the Los Angeles-based firm. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop President Kent Kresa said a key test of B-2 support will be whether 
Congress authorizes and funds production of five of the bombers in the 1991 
Pentagon budget. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has thrown his support to the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to getting on the path to reasonable rate production of 
the B-2," Kresa said. "Right now, we are at very low rates. As we get to five 
and then hopefully to 10, we get into production." 
</P>
<P>
If that occurs, Northrop would increase its production work force while 
reducing staffing for development of the radar-evading bomber. There would be 
little net change in the current 12,000-member B-2 work force. 
</P>
<P>
But Congress may delay B-2 production and order more flight testing. If that 
happens, a significant net reduction in the work force could occur. 
</P>
<P>
Kresa projected that Northrop's work force will be flat to slightly down in 
1990, which depends on the already enacted 1990 Pentagon budget. The firm has 
42,000 employes, 75% of whom are in Southern California. Northrop reduced its 
work force by 3,000 in 1989 to cope with reduced business and to cut overhead. 
In 1987, it hit a peak employment of 48,200. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has planned to buy 132 B-2s for an estimated program cost of $70 
billion or $530 million each, including already completed development. Northrop 
officials say the actual cost for production of the aircraft is about $274 
million each. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the B-2, the company is competing for the giant $68-billion Advanced 
Tactical Fighter program, which is likely to be delayed by falling budgets. 
Northrop has 600 employes working on the program and recently delivered the 
first secret prototype aircraft to the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
Kresa rejects the idea of any major diversification out of the defense industry 
before the end of the 1990s. The only significant non-defense business that the 
company has is the production of fuselages for the Boeing 747 commercial 
airliner. That is growing but remains a small part of Northrop's revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Corp. 
</P>
<P>
While some aerospace companies are facing a difficult period of shrinkage, 
Lockheed has already undergone a considerable downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed's current work force of 80,200, including about 18,200 workers in 
Southern California, is down from a peak of 99,300 in 1987, when its C-5B cargo 
jet program was in full production. 
</P>
<P>
The company, headquartered in Calabasas, derives about 78% of its revenues from 
defense work and the balance from the space agency, commercial markets and 
weapons exports. Its non-defense segment is expected to grow, but Lockheed has 
not set a specific goal for it. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep said he believes that the company is well 
positioned to weather the coming defense cuts, even though Lockheed is not as 
well diversified outside defense as some other prime contractors. 
</P>
<P>
"We are projecting moderate growth," Tellep said. "Now, what we haven't 
factored into that is what you might call a disaster scenario where the defense 
budget gets cut to $200 billion (from its present $291 billion). We don't 
believe that is going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"For the most likely scenarios, which are declines in defense budgets, we think 
we are well postured in the defense market with systems like Trident," he said, 
referring to the submarine-based nuclear missile that Lockheed builds for the 
Navy. "We know that our classified space systems look very healthy. Despite 
Strategic Defense Initiative cuts, we are postured in the strongest programs. 
We don't see in the next several years major cuts in our SDI programs." 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed will deliver in 1990 the last of its F-117A Stealth fighters, the 
top-secret craft that has been in production at the firm's Burbank plant since 
the mid-1980s. In the past year, the aerospace firm has also ceased production 
of the P-3C submarine patrol aircraft, C-5 cargo jet and the TR-1 
reconnaissance plane. 
</P>
<P>
Additional work force cutbacks are likely in Lockheed's aircraft business, 
which is in Burbank, Palmdale and Rye Canyon, as well as in Georgia. But Tellep 
declined to speculate on those impacts. 
</P>
<P>
The dearth of aircraft business at Lockheed makes winning the Advanced Tactical 
Fighter program all the more important. Lockheed is competing against Northrop 
for that Air Force program. The program, however, may come under severe budget 
pressure. The firm is also developing the P-7A anti-submarine patrol plane. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked our people to put together the most pessimistic scenario possible," 
Tellep said. "For the most part, we looked at the structure of Lockheed, and 
our big-ticket programs . . . enjoy high priority. Of the ones in the bag, the 
greater proportion of our revenue and income lie ahead of us. 
</P>
<P>
"So, the common perception is that we are running out of gas and nothing lies 
ahead," he added. "That is just not true." 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics Corp. is facing a continuation of the contraction of its 
missile business that has been going on for the past year. The St. Louis-based 
firm has two of its tactical missile production divisions in Southern 
California, as well as divisions for cruise missile production, airframe 
subcontracting and spacecraft work. 
</P>
<P>
At the firm's Pomona division, which builds the Navy's Standard missile and 
Phalanx gun, employment is down to 5,200 from a peak of about 8,000 three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics Executive Vice President Ralph E. Hawes, who oversees the 
firm's missile business in California, said he expects that Pomona division 
employment could continue to shrink over the next two to three years by 30% to 
40%. The reductions would result from the Navy's decision to establish a second 
production source for Pomona's systems as part of an initiative to increase 
competition and cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, the Navy is procuring one-half the number of Standard missiles and 
Phalanxes that they projected they were going to procure when they established 
second sources on those programs," Hawes observed. "So, there is no question 
there is overcapacity." 
</P>
<P>
The outlook at the firm's Valley Systems division in Rancho Cucamonga is 
somewhat better for the next several years. The division has about 3,400 
workers and should be stable in the near term. But if a second source begins 
production on the Stinger missile, as expected, the division could have excess 
capacity, Hawes said. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics' electronics division and its Convair division, both in San 
Diego, should be stable, Hawes said. 
</P>
<P>
"General Dynamics, overall, I won't say we are in an excellent position, but it 
borders on that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
TRW Inc. 
</P>
<P>
TRW, one of the most enigmatic defense companies, believes that its Space and 
Defense Sector in Redondo Beach, with 800 programs, should weather the upcoming 
defense downturn well. 
</P>
<P>
"While we are uncertain about what the Department of Defense funding will be, 
TRW feels its programs in the arena of command and control, surveillance, 
intelligence and other high-priority systems should position us well for both 
the short term and the long term," Vice President Julien Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
Levine said TRW has a plan to expand its non-defense government business, which 
now amounts to just 10% of its space and defense sector sales, but has not 
established a goal for that growth. The sector comprises about 45% of the 
Cleveland-based parent's sales. Automotive products sales make up 44% of TRW 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the firm has had stable employment in Southern California of 
about 17,700, losing about 3,000 workers through attrition in the past year and 
hiring a like number. The diversified electronics and spacecraft company hit 
peak employment of 20,000 in 1987. In 1988, it laid off 1,000 workers after it 
was told by the Pentagon to stop work on a secret program. 
</P>
<P>
Since so many of TRW's programs are highly classified, it is difficult to 
assess whether they will be jeopardized by a plunging defense budget. One of 
the company's biggest programs is serving as the systems engineer for the Air 
Force's nuclear missile programs. That involves 1,200 jobs in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas will exit the 1980s in one of the most enviable but 
financially risky positions in the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
While some other contractors will be scrambling to avoid calamity as defense 
budgets fall, the St. Louis-based firm's Douglas Aircraft Co. unit in Long 
Beach has a massive commercial and military aircraft backlog that will extend 
production past the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
But Douglas is going through a wrenching period of huge losses on those 
programs, coupled with a sweeping reorganization and an effort to create a new 
corporate culture emphasizing product quality. 
</P>
<P>
It has fallen behind schedule on its Air Force C-17 jet transport, T-45 Navy 
training plane and MD-11 wide-body airliner programs and, during much of 1989, 
was plagued by production delays on its MD-80 series of jetliners. The unit has 
lost $227 million so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, the company announced that it would transfer production of the 
T-45 from Douglas to its McDonnell Aircraft Co. in St. Louis, a move that will 
affect 1,800 workers. But growth in other programs will not result in any job 
losses in Long Beach, Douglas officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas has 37,000 employees in Long Beach, 5,300 at a parts fabrication plant 
in Torrance and 1,000 at out-of-state facilities. That's up from a trough of 
just 12,000 in Long Beach and 1,000 in Torrance in 1984. Company spokesman Don 
Hanson said there will be continued employment growth next year, but not at the 
20% level recorded in the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force is planning to reduce production of the C-17 program, which 
employs 8,000, from the 10 aircraft previously planned to six. That will delay 
a production buildup at Douglas, as the Air Force decides whether it really 
wants the C-17. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, delays in development of the C-17 have resulted in Douglas 
overrunning its target cost on the program and nearing the so-called "contract 
ceiling," over which it would have to absorb all expenses as a loss.

ANIMAL ACTIVISTS ARE CRITICIZED FOR IGNORING CONSTITUTIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL

Regarding the article about animal furs, I agree that furs should not be 
obtained from endangered animals or through the use of inhumane traps, but 
animals raised for their fur are the same to me as animals raised for their 
meat. 
</P>
<P>
If an activist leads an existence free of animal byproducts obtainable only 
through the animal's death, then and only then would I respect his opinion.

ANIMAL ACTIVISTS ARE CRITICIZED FOR IGNORING CONSTITUTIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL

<TEXT>
<P>
The Times recently ran articles regarding animal rights activism ("Confronting 
Animal Rights Activism," Dec. 3) I am a third-generation furrier. Although one 
might say that I am prejudiced, I like to think that I am logical. 
</P>
<P>
As I listen to the spokespersons of the animal rights groups I wonder about 
their ability to deal in a logical manner. 
</P>
<P>
We can see the results of animal rights activists in the sealing industry. 
There are literally millions of surplus seals now polluting the oceans and 
eating the fish, causing an environmental disaster. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, in Orange County as well as other suburban areas, there is a problem 
with coyotes that have lost their natural habitat to urban sprawl and are 
looking for food. What better to nibble on than a small child out playing? Will 
the animal rights activists move from the suburbs to the city so that the 
animals can live in peace? 
</P>
<P>
Fur garments are a renewable resource that often last for over 20 years. Fake 
furs and fur substitutes are made from petroleum products, both a non-renewable 
resource and non-biodegradable. There are many positive facts about the fur 
industry. It is healthy for the economy, healthy for the environment and there 
is a commitment to humane care. 
</P>
<P>
Do animal activists have the right to deny individuals their right to freedom 
of choice? If the animal rights movement is fulfilled, the human race will 
revert to eating and wearing grass and hemp. 
</P>
<P>
I have had rocks thrown through my windows by the Animal Liberation Front and I 
have been picketed. Friends and family in the fur industry have had their lives 
threatened. Any honorable organization will work utilizing the constitutional 
means available to them, not through violence. 
</P>
<P>
Fur is ecologically sound; fur is freedom of choice. The United States is built 
on freedom of choice. The Constitution and the Bill of Rights guarantee freedom 
of choice.

A SKELETON CREW AT CITY HALL CARRIES ON; 
</P>
<P>
BALDWIN PARK: IT IS NOT BUSINESS AS USUAL IN A CITY THAT HAS LOST SO MANY 
OFFICIALS. IN FACT, SOME HOPED-FOR FUNDS MAY HAVE GONE BY THE WAYSIDE. 
</P>

BALDWIN PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most of the last year, Baldwin Park has lived up to its motto of city in 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
Moving on have been the mayor, a city councilman, the city manager, the police 
chief, the director of community services, the director of administrative 
services and the director of housing and economic development. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, the city has only an acting mayor and an acting city manager -- and 
no redevelopment manager or city planner. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the officials departed for personal reasons or better-paying jobs. 
Others were fired, forced to resign or caught in personality disputes. 
</P>
<P>
The departures, however, add up to one thing: some of the most sweeping 
transitions at Baldwin Park City Hall in its 33-year history. Officials hope 
the changes will end up bringing harmony to their modern governmental complex 
just north of the railroad tracks. But the storm has yet to subside. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been just like a ship without a captain," said Councilman Bobbie Izell. 
"And the officers have deserted, too." 
</P>
<P>
The ensuing confusion in at least one instance may have cost the city a chance 
to borrow thousands of dollars. Officials only recently discovered that they 
had failed to request nearly $200,000 in low-interest loans that are routinely 
offered by Los Angeles County to any community redevelopment agency that 
bothers to apply. 
</P>
<P>
A letter was whipped off Nov. 15 asking for the funds, explaining that the city 
had not received its share for the 1988-89 fiscal year "due to the delay of 
communicating" with the county's chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are waiting to hear whether the money is still available. But it 
could have come in handy earlier this month when Baldwin Park was forced to 
lend its own Redevelopment Agency $300,000 to cover a short-term cash flow 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be less than candid to say that I believe everything's been perfect," 
said Beverly Pearce, the city's recently appointed director of housing and 
economic development. "But I'm not interested in casting aspersions or passing 
judgments with the benefit of hindsight. Let's just say we found the problem, 
we see it, and we're fixing it." 
</P>
<P>
Searching for a new city manager for this predominantly Latino, working-class 
community has also added to the disruption. Ralph Webb, who held the post for 
eight years, resigned under fire in May after the council expressed displeasure 
about growing fiscal woes under his administration. 
</P>
<P>
The director of administrative services, Michael Yelton, was named acting 
manager. But he left last month to take a job as director of general services 
for Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
City officials had expected Allen Stephenson, the former city manager of San 
Marino, to take over starting Nov. 13. But after reviewing four months of City 
Council minutes, he told officials he couldn't handle the job full-time. 
</P>
<P>
The post then was offered to another candidate, who, like Stephenson, was 
referred to Baldwin Park by a League of California Cities program that makes 
managers available to short-staffed cities. But that candidate decided to 
become city manager of newly incorporated Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Linda Gair was offered the job of acting manager and declined. 
Finally, on Nov. 27, it fell to Police Chief Carmine Lanza, who just last month 
was promoted from captain after former Chief Richard Hoskin was fired. 
</P>
<P>
"For many months in 1989, there appeared to be conflicts in City Hall," said 
Lanza, who is doing double duty as both police chief and acting manager. "But I 
think we've weathered those storms and come out in good shape. Change isn't 
necessarily bad." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, rather than dwell on the turmoil, many in City Hall prefer to view the 
transition as a process in which the cream rises to the top. Three of the 
department head vacancies have been filled from within. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying it's been easy," said Mayor Pro Tem Bette Lowes. "But our staff 
has pulled in and filled the ranks without missing a beat. I'm amazed and proud 
of everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Lowes, who has been running council meetings since Leo King resigned last month 
to be with his family in Oklahoma, will continue in the post until the city's 
mayoral election in April. 
</P>
<P>
Officials hope that the spate of rapid personnel changes will also help turn 
around the city's financial picture. Anticipating a budget deficit earlier this 
year of $500,000 to $1 million, the council was forced to eliminate several 
staff positions as well as the entire code enforcement team, responsible for 
enforcing the city's health and safety laws. 
</P>
<P>
There are no auto rows or large shopping malls to generate sales tax revenues 
for the city. So the opening June 1 of a 200-room Hilton Hotel was for most 
officials the fiscal highlight of the year. 
</P>
<P>
To make the most of existing businesses, the Chamber of Commerce has begun a 
program to encourage residents to shop in town. Motorists around the city 
spotted with a "Be Part of Baldwin Park" bumper sticker have been awarded gift 
certificates good for $10 to $25 at local stores. 
</P>
<P>
Yet a plan to ease the pinch by imposing a 3% utility tax for the next five 
years was soundly rejected by voters in November. And local tax crusader 
Herschel Keyser, who led a successful recall effort against two councilmen in 
1987 because of their support for a previous utility tax, was elected for the 
first time to the council in the same vote. 
</P>
<P>
There's still hope for balancing next year's budget, though, joked another 
member of the council. With so many departures, think of all the money saved in 
payroll.

DIAMOND BAR LOSES PROPERTY TAXES DUE TO TECHNICALITIES 
</P>

DIAMOND BAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's last hope of salvaging $1.2 million in property tax revenues has 
been dashed by Los Angeles County legal advisers, who refuse to exempt the 
newly incorporated city from technicalities in state law. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar officials have negotiated with the county for months trying to find 
a way around provisions in state law that say the city, because of the timing 
of its incorporation election in March, isn't eligible to receive property 
taxes until December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In a Dec. 11 letter to Mayor Phyllis Papen, Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete 
Schabarum said that after reviewing the city's request, the county counsel has 
determined that "the county of Los Angeles does not have the authority to 
provide an allocation of property tax monies for the 1989-90 fiscal year to the 
city of Diamond Bar." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant County Counsel Lawrence B. Launer, in a Dec. 4 legal opinion to 
Schabarum, said Diamond Bar is classified as a no tax city because it 
incorporated after Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of a Jan. 1 cutoff date is rationally based," Launer said in 
the opinion. 
</P>
<P>
But city officials think otherwise. Papen said Thursday that withholding 
property taxes from newly incorporated cities is unconstitutional and "an 
injustice to the city of Diamond Bar." 
</P>
<P>
"It puts the city in the position of having to provide the full scope of 
municipal services without the benefit of receiving property taxes," she said. 
Diamond Bar assumed full financial responsibility for services on July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Papen added that before Diamond Bar became a city, incorporation proponents may 
have been misled by the Los Angeles County Local Agency Formation Commission, 
which issued a feasibility report indicating what the city's tax base would be 
during the first year. That figure included property taxes, Papen said, and 
didn't specify any conditions for receiving the money. 
</P>
<P>
But LAFCO Executive Officer Ruth Benell said it was the responsibility of 
cityhood proponents to determine when Diamond Bar would be able to receive 
property taxes and then schedule the incorporation election accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't even ask me when they'd start getting property taxes," Benell said 
Thursday. "If they had, I would have referred them to the controller's office, 
which would have given them the right answer." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, cityhood proponents originally wanted a November, 1988, incorporation 
election. But right before the deadline, six residents formally asked LAFCO to 
reconsider the incorporation application. Because LAFCO decided to hold a 
hearing on their request, a November incorporation election was impossible. 
</P>
<P>
The property tax disappointment is the second surprise development to result 
from the timing of Diamond Bar's incorporation. Earlier, city officials learned 
that, under state law, three council members who thought they had won two-year 
terms would instead have to run for reelection after less than a year in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
City officials tried to delay the required April, 1990, election until 
November, 1990, but were turned down by the county. Some approached Assemblyman 
Frank Hill (R-Whittier), who promised to look into the possibility of 
legislation extending the terms another year. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said he would propose the legislation only if one of the three council 
members decided not to run against him for a state Senate seat. Later, under 
criticism for the remark, he dropped the idea of sponsoring the legislation 
altogether.

NAVIDAD EN EL BARRIO HAS BECOME SUPER SANTA FOR THE NEEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA GRIEGO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maria Gonzalez-Lloyd is quite clear about where the holiday food programs for 
the destitute in Hawaiian Gardens would be without Navidad en el Barrio: "In a 
world of hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez-Lloyd is the assistant city administrator in Hawaiian Gardens, one of 
Los Angeles County's 10 poorest cities, with a per capita annual income of 
about $7,000. She also helps coordinate holiday food and toy programs for the 
needy -- one of 40 social services served by Navidad en el Barrio, a 
17-year-old nonprofit agency based in Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all from the old neighborhoods, from the barrio," said Willie Mendoza, 
who sits on the organization's board of directors. "We went to competing high 
schools, some of us left the neighborhood for a while, but we are back." 
</P>
<P>
From Santa Barbara to the hand-to-mouth existence of Skid Row and to San 
Bernardino and Anaheim, Navidad en el Barrio has fed more Latino families 
during the holidays than any other organization in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
This year the agency distributed to social service agencies toys and more than 
20 tons of food for about 20,000 families, said Ray Rosas, the organization's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"We were getting 120 calls a day from people requesting food baskets," said 
Rosas, looking over boxes and bags full of potatoes, rice, beans, cheese and 
other food in a Commerce warehouse. "It never ends." 
</P>
<P>
No sooner had he spoken than three women carrying infants came to the door 
carrying a worn scrap of newspaper with a description of Navidad's program and 
the warehouse address. 
</P>
<P>
Esther Duenes, 38, from East Los Angeles looked past Rosas at a five-foot-high 
row of boxed potatoes as she told him she had seven children and a husband who 
had not worked since his plant was shut down two weeks ago. She would like a 
Christmas basket, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosas cringed. Navidad does not distribute food directly to residents. He 
explained that she must go to a social service agency and sign up to be 
eligible for a basket. She would be put on a waiting list and the food would go 
to the agency the next day. The agency would distribute the baskets. He handed 
her a piece of paper with a number on it and watched her as she left. 
</P>
<P>
Duenes was late. Navidad could give only 500 Christmas baskets per agency, and 
agency lists were long. Duenes would be lucky if she received a basket. If not, 
Rosas said she could receive $5 and $10 gift certificates from Navidad to buy 
groceries. 
</P>
<P>
"We never say we don't have enough," Rosas said. "We try to have something for 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Rosas, 41, was hired by the organization four months ago and since then has had 
his hands full fielding calls for help and planning the program's future. 
</P>
<P>
Old-timers, who listen warily to the aggressive Rosas and ambitious plans for 
expanding the organization, tell the story of a Christmas 17 years ago when a 
young man and his wife were seen knocking on doors in the old neighborhoods of 
East Los Angeles. Their plea for food was eventually heard by executives from 
KMEX-TV. Danny Villanueva, who was then president and general manager of 
KMEX-TV, met with several Montebello residents who came to his office looking 
for a way to help poor Latinos who were too uneducated, too frightened or 
simply too proud to ask. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a great need in the Latino community," said Alex Esquivel, one of 
the founders of Navidad en el Barrio. "We had to go to schools and clubs and 
businesses to ask for donations." 
</P>
<P>
Villanueva said he was concerned that Latinos were not helping each other. He 
said he foresaw Navidad en el Barrio becoming a tool to teach Latinos to 
volunteer. After 18 years and no end to Navidad's growth in sight, he said it 
is the increased number of volunteers that makes him most proud. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are one, maybe two generations away from the immigrants," 
Villanueva said. "They are one or two generations away from the poverty they 
are trying to eradicate, and they, the poor, have learned to help those who are 
poorer. That is the spirit of Navidad. We cannot forget where we came from. 
We've got to put our hand down there again and pull up someone else." 
</P>
<P>
One year after Navidad was organized, KMEX-TV hosted its first telethon for the 
organization as a community relations project. When it was over, $5,500 had 
been pledged and a tradition begun. 
</P>
<P>
Navidad en el Barrio became synonymous with KMEX-TV, whose staff supported the 
organization with equipment, facilities and contacts. The telethons, broadcast 
in early December, have grown into star-studded affairs with international 
entertainment and corporate sponsors. They are Navidad's largest source of 
money. This year $437,000 was donated in pledges, Rosas said. Navidad still 
relies on the help of schools, clubs and businesses that came to the 
organization's aid years ago, board members say. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten so big because we are the only Mexican-American agency serving 
Mexican-American people," Rosas said. But even that is changing, Rosas said. 
Today about 15% of the families they feed are black and Asian. 
</P>
<P>
With the change in demographics and the overwhelming number of people who must 
be fed, Navidad en el Barrio must become an independent corporation, Rosas 
said. To do that, he said, the organization will need more money. Much of the 
donations Navidad receives are donations of services or equipment or bulk food 
items, not cash. Also, many pledges do not come through. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Navidad en el Barrio separated itself from KMEX-TV this year and 
its board of directors accepted the donation of an office in the city of 
Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
"It has grown in quantum leaps," Villanueva said. "It became an institution and 
it was time to wean it away from the station. It has now reached the level 
where it can fly on its own." 
</P>
<P>
The telethons will not end, however, Esquivel said. But the organization has 
hired Rosas and secretary Elisa Alvarez as its first paid employees. Rosas 
already has started planning for yearlong activities. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is time we get out of the barrio," he said. "We must become a 
larger part of the community and not just put up our tents at Christmas."

began 17 years ago as an immediate response to needy Mexican-Americans in the 
East Los Angeles barrio. Sponsored by KMEX-TV and a few Latino community 
volunteers, the food program for needy Latinos has grown to where it now serves 
40 social service agencies from its headquarters in Montebello. It recently 
hired its first paid staff of two.

To Jack Alpan, the towering structure being built at the northwest corner of 
South Poinsettia Place and 2nd Street represents his dream home, the fruits of 
more than two decades of work as a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
To his future neighbors in the Miracle Mile North area, the structure 
represents something much more ominous: a threat to the architectural character 
of their quiet, tree-lined neighborhood and the unwelcome intrusion of big-city 
development into their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a monstrosity," said neighbor Judie Feldstein of the three-story 
structure that is twice the size of most of the homes on the street. 
</P>
<P>
"Look down the block, to the right and to the left, and you see the same types 
of beautiful homes. That's why we all live here, because we love the 
neighborhood. But this is ruining it," Feldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
The house is far from finished, yet neighbors say it exemplifies the need to 
protect the neat rows of Spanish/Mediterranean and English Tudor-style homes 
from developers insensitive to the community's wishes. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors three years ago began a drive to do just that, before Alpan ever 
entered the picture. His house has galvanized their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Feldstein, for example, said that as soon as she got wind of Alpan's plans more 
than a year ago, she joined the Rancho Park La Brea Neighborhood Assn., a group 
that is helping lead the drive to preserve the area by having the city declare 
it a historical preservation overlay zone. 
</P>
<P>
Cultural affairs officials have supported their efforts, as has Zev 
Yaroslavsky, councilman for the area. They say the area is unique in that it 
has kept its architectural style intact since the 1920s, when the first of the 
modest stucco and red-tile roof homes were built. 
</P>
<P>
In all, more than 90% of the 500 homes are of the same architectural stylings 
in the area, which is bounded by Beverly Boulevard on the north, 3rd Street on 
the south, La Brea on the east and Gardner on the west. 
</P>
<P>
If the preservation zone is approved by city planners and the City Council, 
which is expected by early February, it will be only the fourth such zone in 
the city. The city Planning Commission has set a Jan. 18 final vote on the 
issue. If approval is granted, a neighborhood-based review board would be 
established to screen all proposals for building and remodeling and to make 
sure they conform to the area's architectural style in both shape and size. 
</P>
<P>
Although advisory in nature, the group's recommendations to city planning and 
cultural heritage officials responsible for approving such projects "will carry 
a lot of weight," said Michael Davies, a hearing examiner for the Planning 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member advisory board also could help prevent architecturally or 
historically significant buildings from being demolished. One member would be 
selected by the mayor, another by the City Council, two by the city Cultural 
Heritage Commission, and an at-large member would be chosen by the first four 
members, according to city law. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, when city officials approved the concept, preservation zones have 
been established in Angeleno Heights in Echo Park, South Carthay in the 
Wilshire District and Melrose Hill in Hollywood, Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, who lives in the Miracle Mile North neighborhood, helped persuade 
the City Council to spend $15,000 in March, 1987, to study whether a 
preservation zone was warranted for the area. In March, 1988, the Cultural 
Heritage Commission gave its approval. 
</P>
<P>
Although the campaign has progressed slowly, the Alpan home "has become a 
rallying point, because it's such an abuse of living in a neighborhood," said 
Ronnie Gootkin, president of the La Brea neighborhood group. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obnoxious, and the neighbors are upset," Gootkin said. "They don't want 
to see this practice flourish." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky agreed, calling the house "an outrage." 
</P>
<P>
"It is an example of how one house improperly designed and insensitive to the 
neighborhood can be a degradation of the whole block," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It only takes one to screw things up, and we've had that one," Yaroslavsky 
said. "We don't want another one." 
</P>
<P>
Alpan and his wife say they can't understand why their future neighbors are so 
upset. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently they can't learn to accept beauty that is not in keeping with their 
own viewpoint of beauty," said Alpan's wife, Jenny. 
</P>
<P>
Alpan says he has been dreaming of building the home during more than 20 years 
he has toiled as a dentist in downtown Los Angeles. He says he had no idea he 
had caused so much controversy, and that his neighbors have been curious but 
not confrontational. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not happy making my neighbors unhappy," Alpan said last week. "I spent 
two years on this -- it's my design, and I think it's beautiful. So, when they 
say it isn't, it hurts me." 
</P>
<P>
Alpan agrees with the concept of protecting the neighborhood through the use of 
the advisory board, but says it is too late to make the rules apply to him 
since city planners approved the project and he has spent "a fortune" on it. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Alpan says, the home will be a showcase of the Mediterranean style 
that dominates the area, and will fit the neighborhood quite well. It's just 
that it will be more than twice the size of the other homes. 
</P>
<P>
And that's what has some neighbors upset. 
</P>
<P>
Frieda Kahan, who has lived in the house immediately to the north of Alpan's 
for 17 years, said she doesn't care about the house's architecture but is 
bothered by its size. The Alpan home, she said, takes up nearly the entire plot 
of land it is built on and crowds her home. What's more, the three-story 
structure blocks her sunlight, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The sheer height of the house and its massive attic has prompted neighbors to 
speculate that Alpan will build a third floor of living space in violation of 
his city-approved building plan. Alpan has denied that he plans to use the 
third floor as a dental clinic or a playroom for his two children. 
</P>
<P>
And although he can't do anything about the size of the house, Yaroslavsky said 
he will at least make sure Alpan keeps to the city-approved plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole block is lying in wait," the councilman said. "He's going to have 
the most scrutinized house in America over the next few years." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yaroslavsky predicts other communities will make use of the 
preservation zone concept. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be more such preservation zones in the future, I assure you, 
because there is a greater sense in the city about preserving the richness of 
our past," Yaroslavsky said. "And this is the best tool to preserve 
historically and architecturally significant neighborhoods without emasculating 
homeowners' rights." 
</P>
<P>
Preservation status could conceivably raise the real estate value of 
Yaroslavsky's own home -- and hence benefit him personally. But he said the 
city attorney's office has told him there is no conflict of interest, and he is 
only doing what is best for his constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"The neighborhood shouldn't be penalized just because I live there," he said.

A PLACE WHERE FEAR IS VANQUISHED; 
</P>
<P>
AIDS: DESPITE DEATH AND SUFFERING AROUND THEM, TOM RINGLED AND WORKERS AT THE 
CITY OF ANGELS HOSPICE INSIST THEY'RE NORMAL PEOPLE BLESSED WITH AN UPLIFTING 
JOB. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It is a fall afternoon at the City of Angels Hospice, a three-bedroom house on 
a quiet corner in Hollywood where fear is conquered and death embraced, the 
last home this year of more than 30 people. 
</P>
<P>
A Santa Ana wind cools the living room through an open front door. On a leather 
sofa, a gaunt, 23-year-old man with AIDS lies wrapped in blankets. He has been 
moved from his bedroom to the couch to watch television and eat lunch, but he 
has fallen asleep. He is very still -- only the rising and falling of his chest 
betray the life remaining in him. In three weeks, the breaths will stop. 
</P>
<P>
By the dining room table, Tom Ringled and a fellow staff member, Jim Rayl, are 
wrestling with a Sparkletts water bottle labeled "Pennies for AIDS." It has 
been filled by patrons of a gay bar. Ringled and Rayl are trying to coax out 
the coins. 
</P>
<P>
The man on the couch stirs, and Ringled walks over and touches his forehead. He 
props the man up with pillows to make him more comfortable, turns on the TV to 
a sports channel and brings in a lunch tray. 
</P>
<P>
Ringled is giving palliative care. He will feed, dress and bathe the man, be 
his best friend, hold his hand and become a surrogate family. He will give the 
dying man drugs for pain. However, there are no crash carts, no IVs, no 
high-tech boxes with blinking lights or beeping monitors. Of course, Ringled 
will not prevent the man from dying. 
</P>
<P>
Hospice workers like Ringled try to dispel two myths: that they are saints and 
that their work is depressing. He said they are normal people blessed with 
extraordinary, uplifting jobs. If anything, staff and volunteers in hospices 
become addicted to their work. They develop close friendships with patients and 
have difficulty leaving them at the end of the work day. After months of 
suffering and illness, he says, death is welcomed as the end of suffering. 
</P>
<P>
Ringled, 35, has a special empathy for his patients, because he has acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
He moved to Los Angeles 12 years ago, ending 20 years of frustration over 
hiding his homosexuality. He knew as a boy that he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 6 years old, I knew it. I remember an uncle of mine whom I thought 
was very handsome and I was so totally attracted to, and I knew nothing about 
sex." 
</P>
<P>
He dated girls in high school, lived with a woman when he was in his early 20s 
and fathered a child. "We got along terrific. It was fine. But all the time, I 
was only doing this for the rest of the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When he was 23, he headed west. He had his first homosexual relationship two 
years later. It was about the same time that doctors noticed that gay men were 
dying in unusual numbers of a previously unrecognized disease. Ringled didn't 
know he was endangering his life. "Ten years ago, when probably we were all 
infected, we never heard about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He started a business installing hardwood floors and settled into a 
relationship with one man. When his lover's parents became terminally ill, he 
cared for them and found the work rewarding. After taking a course at a 
vocational nursing school, he started caring for AIDS patients in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
By early 1988, Ringled was the manager of Hughes House, a five-bed hospice in 
West Los Angeles. But in May, he was forced to take sick leave because he had a 
stomach virus linked to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The phone rings and is answered elsewhere by the hospice director, Mary Nalick, 
45. She is working in her makeshift office in one of four garages in an 
apartment building behind the hospice. In the other three garages, she collects 
donations for the regular garage sale that raises about half of each month's 
$13,000 in expense money. The rest of the budget comes from fund-raising 
efforts, like the Sparkletts water bottle, and patients' insurance. 
</P>
<P>
The hospice property was bought last year for $220,000 with a grant from a 
foundation established by junk-bond financier Michael Milken. After being 
renovated by volunteer workers, it opened in December, 1988. Nalick has managed 
to stay about two months ahead of the bill collector since. 
</P>
<P>
There is room for five patients, but since the average patient dies within 
three weeks, there are frequent vacancies. On this particular day, there are 
four patients in the hospice, and they are all sleeping. There is a kitchen and 
two bathrooms, one for patients and another for staff. The living room has 
leather sofas on hardwood floors and a big-screen TV. 
</P>
<P>
Ringled explains that AIDS tends to be a drawn-out, accelerating disease. He is 
typical in that although he learned that he was infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus probably between six and 10 years ago, he did not have 
any symptoms until recently. His experience treating AIDS patients has taught 
him that, once AIDS becomes active, "you get one virus, you get over it, and a 
couple of months later you get another one and another one, until you get 
weaker and weaker. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden you have pneumonia, you have skin cancer, you have chronic 
diarrhea, you have vomiting, all happening at once." Today, he is strong enough 
to work three days a week at City of Angels. "I'm totally addicted to the job," 
he said. "I couldn't stop if I wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
Anger keeps him going, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I get angry. I'm hurt at how we all handle this as a race of people. How can 
we let people get this sick and do nothing? 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem is loneliness. If you can give them a pill for anything, 
that would be the one pill I'd want. 
</P>
<P>
"On a day that somebody dies, it hurts. I'm not going to say it doesn't. I 
think what hurts worse is now I refuse to go to funerals or wakes or anything, 
because when I go there I see 75, 80 people there, and for six months he was in 
my care, and I don't know these people. That's when I get angry." 
</P>
<P>
Ringled and Rayl finish emptying the Sparkletts bottle, and the patient on the 
couch awakens. Ringled helps him back to bed. He keeps up a friendly banter as 
they smoke and play cards. 
</P>
<P>
Some patients walk into the City of Angels. Some are carried. Some are 
transferred from hospitals after long bouts with chemotherapy. Some have 
dementia, others are alert. 
</P>
<P>
Some have lost everything: their families, friends, jobs, homes, insurance, 
bank accounts, credit and possessions. Others enter hospices simply because 
they believe it is the best place to die. 
</P>
<P>
"After a while, they realize, 'My God, I'm around people that are just like 
me,' " Ringled said. "All of a sudden, race doesn't matter or what kind of 
house you live in. None of that matters anymore. You're you, and I'm me. How 
can we help each other?" 
</P>
<P>
Ringled finishes the card game and leaves to check another patient in the back 
bedroom. There he helps the patient move out to the dining room for lunch. The 
second patient eats a few bites and says he is in pain. Ringled and Rayl are 
standing on either side of him and reach out in support. They help him back to 
bed, and Ringled massages the man's legs. 
</P>
<P>
Ringled has cared for more than 40 terminally ill patients. "Burnout is a 
problem," he said. "I think that's what happened to me, why I got sick in May. 
I didn't know where to draw the line, that I don't have to be responsible for 
that man's loneliness or that man's pain. I was putting in 16-hour days eight 
days a week." 
</P>
<P>
Treating terminally ill patients has helped him overcome his own fear of death. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see somebody who's been sick for so long and in so much pain finally 
out of that pain, death is anything but ugly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're born, and we die. Hopefully, we can do some good in between. I don't 
want to die, but at the same time, it's only because I want to do more here. 
I'm not afraid of it anymore. I just realize that it's just as natural as 
growing hair. It just happens to you. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen so many people die, and I see that it's just rest. You know these 
people just stop. Not so terrible." 
</P>

COLLEGE BUDGET UP $1.7 MILLION DUE TO NEW STATE REVENUE

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Long Beach City College Board of Trustees has approved a budget of more 
than $74 million, representing an increase of about $1.7 million over the 
previous academic year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
College officials say the increased revenue is due, in part, to new income 
sources such as Proposition 98, which funds employer-based training programs. 
</P>
<P>
The new budget is broken down roughly as follows: 75.4% for salaries and 
benefits, 3.1% for books and supplies, 8.6% for operating expenses and 4.2% for 
capital outlay. 
</P>
<P>
The anticipated ending balance, according to officials, is 8.7%.

WESTLAKE VILLAGE BANS MENORAH NEAR CITY HALL; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: OFFICIALS BAR DISPLAY BESIDE CHRISTMAS TREE ON GROUNDS THAT EIGHT-DAY 
HANUKKAH CELEBRATION IS NOT A NATIONAL HOLIDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A Jewish center's request to display a Hanukkah menorah next to the Westlake 
Village City Hall Christmas tree has been denied by officials who said that the 
eight-day celebration is not a national holiday and that it lacks the secular 
appeal of Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Larry Bagley, who rejected a request this month to display the 
menorah, also said the City Hall reception area was too small to accommodate 
decorations for cultural holidays not endorsed by the state or federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The decision has ignited fears of anti-Semitism among Jews and prompted dozens 
of concerned telephone calls to Chabad of the Conejo, a community group with 
synagogues and cultural centers in Westlake Village and Agoura Hills, Associate 
Director Rabbi Yitzchak Sapochkinsky said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Sapochkinsky said he did not think the city's motives were anti-Semitic, but he 
called the decision by Bagley "a shameful thing." 
</P>
<P>
Bagley said he knew of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in July that a menorah, 
like a Christmas tree, is a secular symbol and therefore could be publicly 
displayed without violating constitutional bans on governmental endorsement of 
religions. Bagley said the decision allowed -- but did not require -- that 
menorahs be displayed. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want anybody of any particular cultural group to feel we weren't 
concerned or didn't have good thoughts for their religious or cultural 
symbols," Bagley said. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the Beverly Hills City Council decided to allow the display of a 
menorah on public property but denied a request to display a cross. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills officials, in interpreting the Supreme Court decision, said the 
display of a cross violates the separation of church and state because the 
cross is an overt religious symbol with clear associations with the Crucifixion 
and Resurrection of Christ, and thus Christian theology. 
</P>
<P>
The 28-foot high menorah is on display in the Beverly Gardens, on Santa Monica 
Boulevard between Beverly and Canon drives. 
</P>
<P>
Sapochkinsky estimated that several thousand Jewish people live in the Conejo 
Valley, mostly in Thousand Oaks and Agoura Hills. Both of those cities approved 
Chabad center requests for permission to display a menorah, and the Thousand 
Oaks City Council last week held a menorah-lighting ceremony at the start of 
its meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake Village Mayor Bonnie Klove said last week that the council did not 
plan to reconsider Bagley's decision before the start of the eight-day Hanukkah 
celebration, which began last Friday. She said that while a Christmas tree is a 
secular symbol, a menorah is a religious symbol. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Pro Tem Ken Rufener agreed in a Dec. 11 letter to Rabbi Moshe Bryski, 
Chabad's regional director. "Christmas is a festive season shared by people of 
all religions and ethnic backgrounds," Rufener wrote. "Surely you are aware 
that Jewish families in our community, as well as Christian families, give and 
attend Christmas parties."

SHOPPING -- A HOLIDAY TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are some clever little jingles and bumper stickers that talk about 
shopping until you drop, and some people being born to shop. Well, if they ever 
had any application, it is the last few days before Christmas, when all through 
the malls every creature scurries. 
</P>

forbid turns in certain areas of Los Cerritos Center.

The shopping frenzy will come to a halt tonight and take a day of rest on 
Monday. But brace yourself, it resumes again on Tuesday with returns and 
exchanges.

WATER OFFICIALS TRY HIGH-TECH DEVICE TO AID CONSERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a thick plot of grass behind the headquarters of a water district office in 
Claremont, a high-tech attempt at water conservation has begun in the 
semi-desert of the eastern San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
A computerized weather station records data on seven weather elements, then 
feeds the information to those who irrigate the biggest urban and suburban 
water consumers: golf courses, cemeteries and school playgrounds. Water is 
saved when water consumers, using information from the station, learn how much 
to irrigate, and when. 
</P>
<P>
Water officials unveiled the station at a recent dedication ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Water experts say the use of such stations could save millions of gallons of 
water each year in Southern California. Phillip E. Hitchcock, in charge of the 
program for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, estimates 
the savings could total as much as 50,000 acre feet a year. One acre foot 
equals 326,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a huge amount, but it is significant," Hitchcock said. 
</P>
<P>
The Claremont field is similar to more than 70 others throughout the state. 
Each station relays its data to a central computer in Sacramento, and users of 
the system can, by computer, access daily weather and irrigation information 
from the station in their area. 
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan provides water to 14.7 million residents in six counties and 
helped the Three Valleys Municipal Water District, based in Claremont, purchase 
and install its station. For the last two years the state Department of Water 
Resources has overseen the program, known as the California Irrigation 
Management Information System.

<P>
The city is expanding its Paint-Up and Fix-Up Program, a special service for 
low-income senior citizens and handicapped homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mayor John Chavez, qualified residents can have insulation 
blankets and earthquake safety straps installed on their water heaters free of 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimate that by wrapping a water heater with an insulated 
blanket, residents can save about 20% on their water-heating bills. A strap can 
keep the water heater from tipping over in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The Paint-Up and Fix-Up Program also includes installation of smoke detectors 
and deadbolt locks, repair of broken windows and repainting of home exteriors. 
The services are free. Eligible homeowners may contact the Pico Rivera Housing 
Department at 942-2000, Ext. 276.

APARTMENT LIFE: CONDO RENTER MERITS RELOCATION FEE IF ASKED TO MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, Postema is editor of Apartment Age Magazine, a publication of 
the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, an apartment owners' service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I have been renting a condominium in San Pedro since March. I have a 
month-to-month rental agreement. The rental agreement calls for a 30-day 
written notice by either the owner or renter to terminate the occupancy of the 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that I have just been asked verbally to move by the end of the 
month. The owner made no mention of any relocation money. 
</P>
<P>
I read in your recent Times column that tenants are entitled to $2,000 
relocation money if asked to move by the landlord. (The owner is selling and 
the new owner wants to move in.) 
</P>
<P>
Here are my problems and questions. Do I have to move based upon the verbal 
notice? Do I get any relocation money? If yes, how much do I get? Do I get any 
more because my fiance lives with me and is on the rental agreement? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Unless your condo is new construction or luxury housing, as defined by 
L.A.'s rent ordinance, it is likely covered by the rent law and entitles you to 
relocation money. First, let's review the exemptions. 
</P>
<P>
New construction is defined as anything for which a "first certificate of 
occupancy" was issued after October 31, 1978. Luxury housing is defined as 
housing that rented for the following monthly rent levels, regardless of 
current rent levels, as of May 31, 1978: 0-bedrooms, $320; 1-bedroom, $420; 
2-bedrooms, $588; 3-bedrooms, $756, or 4 or more bedrooms, $823. 
</P>
<P>
The unit or building may also be exempted because it was substantially 
renovated, however, assuming it isn't, and you are covered by the rent law, you 
are entitled to relocation money in the amount of $2,000. (You don't get 
anything extra for the fiance.) 
</P>
<P>
As far as when you may have to move, state law requires a 30-day written 
notice, just as it is written into your rental agreement. 
</P>
<P>
What Would Manager's Rent Be If He Quits? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have managed a nine-unit apartment building in Mar Vista for 11 years. 
When I moved in, the rent was $250 a month. New tenants moving in now pay $675. 
My rent has remained at $175 a month for the past 11 years. My question is 
this: If I give up managing this unit, what will my rent be? The apartment has 
been under rent control all these years. Had I moved in and not managed 11 
years ago, my rent would be $450. Will that be my rent or will it be $650 or 
some other amount? 
</P>
<P>
A: It sounds like your rent will be about $450 a month. Here's the formula 
according to Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Director Barbara Zeidman. Because 
you moved in as the manager, if you quit the job and stay, the rent will be the 
"base rent" amount plus all of the annual adjustments allowed to it since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, $250 plus 7% per year through June 30, 1985. After that the 
annual increases varied at the following rates: 4% from July 1, 1985 to June 
30, 1986; 5% from July 1, 1986 to June 30, 1987; 4% from July 1, 1987 to June 
30, 1988; 4% from July 1, 1988 to June 30, 1989, and 5% from July 1, 1989 to 
June 30, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming a 7% rent increase in 1985 and 5% in 1990, with no other rent 
adjustments allowed, our calculators say the rent would be $469.79 a month. 
</P>
<P>
No Interest Is Paid on Deposits in Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
Q: In 1985 the deposit for our one-bedroom apartment in Long Beach was $560. 
When we recently moved, we got a check for $560 within two weeks as required by 
state law. Here's my question. Since the money was literally "on deposit," 
aren't we entitled to interest on it? 
</P>
<P>
A: There is no requirement for apartment owners to pay interest on security 
deposits in Long Beach. Very few California cities require interest payments on 
such deposits. 
</P>
<P>
And while it may seem unfair that you get no interest on your money, remember 
that the annual interest on a $560 deposit would likely be paid at about a 
5.75% rate, yielding $32.20. 
</P>
<P>
The bookkeeping costs required to administer the records and payments of such 
systems have been estimated at a minimum of $35 a unit that turns over. That 
includes reporting of any interest payments over $10 to the IRS and Franchise 
Tax Board. 
</P>
<P>
Rent Reduction Due If Amenity Removed 
</P>
<P>
Q: Recently, the owner of our Mid-Wilshire apartment building installed 
security gates and increased our rents. That's fine, however, two years ago he 
eliminated the swimming pool here but did not lower the rents. Shouldn't he 
have lowered the rents when he removed that amenity? If yes, is the reduction 
retroactive to the date of the removal of the pool? 
</P>
<P>
A: While Los Angeles' rent law does require rent reductions for diminished 
services, there is no specific dollar amount of reduction for swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Fleck, the house planning and economic analyst for the city of Los Angeles' 
Rent Stabilization Division, recommends that you and your fellow renters 
attempt to work out a solution with the owner. 
</P>
<P>
If he refuses to negotiate, file a complaint with the city. If it can't work 
out a rent reduction compromise with the owner, it may prosecute him in court.

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: SALES CONTRACT SHOULD SPECIFY ALL ITEMS INCLUDED IN 
PURCHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Robert J. Bruss is a San Francisco-area lawyer, author and 
real estate broker. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I am still livid with rage at how we got swindled on the purchase of 
our home, which closed about a month ago. The listing the realtor showed us 
itemized the things that were included in the sale, such as stove, 
refrigerator, washer and dryer. But we are not professional home buyers, so we 
were not aware these items were not included on the purchase contract we signed 
to buy the house. We just presumed everything which was on the listing sheet 
would be included. 
</P>
<P>
To our surprise, when we got the keys to the house, the seller had stripped the 
house bare. She didn't even leave any light bulbs. It cost us over $4,000 to 
replace the appliances and everything else the seller stole. 
</P>
<P>
When we confronted the realtor, he said, "Well, you didn't say anything when we 
wrote up the contract, so I presumed you had your own appliances." We talked to 
our attorney and she said it is not worth the time and cost to sue the seller 
because the legal fees would probably eat up most of what we might win. What 
should we do? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Your attorney is correct that legal costs would eat up most of the 
$4,000 you might win by suing the seller. But I hope you haven't forgotten the 
realtor, who apparently misrepresented the home to you. If he implied that the 
appliances were part of the sale price, by showing you the listing sheet, then 
those appliances must be included. 
</P>
<P>
The seller is correct that if you didn't itemize the personal property you 
wanted included in the sale, then those items are not automatically part of the 
sale of real estate. However, your leverage is with the realtor, who badly 
goofed by not itemizing the appliances on the sales contract. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest you put pressure on the agent to make things right. If he refuses to 
do so, don't hesitate to let him know you will file a complaint for 
misrepresentation and fraud with the state real estate commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
It would be much cheaper for the realtor to pay you the $4,000 rather than to 
risk losing his license. In addition, file a complaint with the local Board of 
Realtors, which may discipline its wayward member. 
</P>
<P>
Over-55 Home Sellers Have 2 Years to Decide 
</P>
<P>
Q: My parents are considering buying a second home and possibly selling their 
old home. They are well over 55 and qualify for the $125,000 home sale tax 
exemption. But they are not sure if they want to sell their old home before 
they try out living in their new home in a new town. Could they rent out their 
old home for a while before they decide to sell it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Let's review the Internal Revenue Code "over 55 rule." To qualify, the 
home seller must be 55 or older on the day of sale, have owned and lived in the 
principal residence any three of the five years before sale and never have used 
this tax break before. 
</P>
<P>
This means your parents can move out of their principal residence and rent out 
their old home for up to two years while they try living in their second home. 
</P>
<P>
Within the two years they can decide if they want to sell their former 
residence and claim their $125,000 tax-free home sale profits even though it 
was rented for up to two years. Ask your tax adviser to explain further. 
</P>
<P>
Buyer in Trouble Without Written Pact 
</P>
<P>
Q: About a year ago, my wife and I bought a vacant lot where we want to build 
our dream home. We paid $10,000 down, and the seller carried back the balance 
on a first mortgage. She said when we are ready to build she would consider 
subordinating her loan to a new construction loan. 
</P>
<P>
Now we are ready to start construction. We have the plans ready, the city has 
issued the building permit and we arranged a construction loan. But our seller 
says she doesn't want to subordinate her loan to make it a second mortgage to a 
new first mortgage. How can we force her to honor her promise? 
</P>
<P>
A: You should have gotten the seller's subordination agreement in writing. As 
you know, if the seller subordinates her loan, it will become a second mortgage 
behind the new first mortgage construction loan. 
</P>
<P>
However, the statute of frauds requires subordination agreements and virtually 
all other real estate contracts to be in writing to be legally enforceable. You 
may wish to consult a real estate attorney, but don't get your hopes up. 
</P>
<P>
Does Buyer or Seller Pay for Insurance? 
</P>
<P>
Q: Many times you have recommended that property buyers obtain title insurance. 
But you never say whether the buyer or seller should pay the premium. It seems 
to me the seller should pay since it is the seller's problem to deliver good 
title. 
</P>
<P>
A: Everything is negotiable. However, local custom usually determines whether 
the buyer or seller pays for title insurance. For example, in the county where 
I live, the buyer usually pays for title insurance. But in the adjoining county 
the seller customarily buys the title insurance. Although local custom usually 
prevails, the buyer and seller can negotiate on who gets to pay for the title 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Both Homeowners Must Sign the Deed 
</P>
<P>
Q: My father and I own a rental house. We listed it for sale with a realty 
agent. While my father was away on vacation the agent brought an excellent 
offer. After phoning my father, who agreed to accept the offer, I signed it. 
But when the time came to sign the deed, he refused and said we should be 
getting more for the house. Now the realty agent and the buyer threaten to sue 
us if we don't deliver the deed. Can I sign the deed on behalf of my father? 
</P>
<P>
A: Unless you hold a power of attorney signed by your father you have no right 
to sign the deed on his behalf. By accepting that purchase offer alone, you 
obligated yourself to sell the property. Although you signed in good faith, if 
the realty agent sued you, you might be obligated for the sales commission. You 
are in a very messy situation. If you can't persuade your father to sign the 
deed, I suggest you consult a real estate attorney. 
</P>
<P>
'In-Law' Apartment May Not Be Legal 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have seen several houses advertised for sale with an "in-law apartment." 
Please explain what this means. Why don't they just say it is a two-family 
duplex? 
</P>
<P>
A: Advertising a house for sale with an "in-law apartment" is usually a 
shorthand way of saying the house has an illegal apartment that could be 
suitable for occupancy by a mother-in-law. Before you buy a house with an 
in-law apartment, check with the city as to the apartment's legality. If you 
plan to rent it, the city might force you to vacate it. Don't pay much extra 
for such an illegal apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Is Auction a Good Way to Sell a House? 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have had my house listed for sale for two months with no purchase offers 
so far. The realty agent says the market is slow in our town now. Last week, I 
received in the mail a solicitation to auction my house. At first I thought it 
was a joke. But then I called the company and found they are legitimate and 
have had considerable success selling houses. What do you think of auctioning 
my house? 
</P>
<P>
A: Auctions are used primarily to sell distress property. Unless your home fits 
into that situation I would avoid holding an auction. If you are not in a 
situation where you absolutely must sell, I would forget about auctioning your 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem with auctions is financing. If the auctioneer can offer 
financing for prospective buyers, then you may want to reconsider. But most 
auctioneers do not offer financing. As a result, many sales confirmed at real 
estate auctions are never completed if the buyer cannot qualify for a new 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
A better alternative, if you are satisfied with your realty agent, is to renew 
your listing for an additional 30 days. Get the agent's written promise to 
actively market your house, such as with newspaper ads and weekend open houses. 
If you are not satisfied with your realty agent, switch to a better agent when 
you current listing expires. 
</P>
<P>
Tax-Deferred Trades Are Alive and Well 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have been unable to get any information if Congress changed the rules for 
tax-deferred exchanges before they adjourned. I understand they were planning 
on requiring exchanges to be limited to similar kinds of property and to 
require a 1- or 2-year holding period after acquiring a property in the 
exchange. Please clarify. 
</P>
<P>
A: The good news is that Congress did not significantly change the tax-deferred 
exchange rules. Fortunately, the "like kind" rule was not changed. You can 
still trade, for example, land for buildings, apartments for commercial 
property and a warehouse for a parking lot. Neither was any minimum time limit 
set for holding property acquired in a tax-deferred change. However, exchanges 
of foreign property were eliminated and new limitations were placed on trades 
between relatives. Thankfully, tax-deferred exchanges survived Congress 
relatively unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Sales Commission Split Leaves Little 
</P>
<P>
Q: So many people read your columns in our area I wish you would explain to 
home buyers and sellers how real estate sales commissions are split. As a 
realty salesman, I am often asked to cut my commission. But when I politely 
explain that I only receive about 25% of the total commission, the sellers back 
off. 
</P>
<P>
The commission seems big in dollar amounts but when it is split four ways 
between my broker, myself, the other broker and the other salesperson there 
isn't much commission to cut. Your help would be appreciated in explaining this 
to the public. 
</P>
<P>
A: In my opinion, the only time to cut the sales commission that the seller 
agreed to pay to the realty agent occurs if the agent brings in a purchase 
offer substantially below the asking price recommended by the agent. Then I 
think the agent should share in the price reduction for misleading the seller 
as to the attainable price. 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate how sales commissions are split, suppose you sell a $100,000 
house and earn a $6,000 gross sales commission. If the purchase offer was 
obtained by an agent from another office, that firm receives $3,000 and your 
firm receives $3,000. Each salesperson then usually receives half of the 
broker's share, or $1,500, in this example. 
</P>
<P>
How High a Deposit Can Seller Expect? 
</P>
<P>
Q: We live in a rural area where there aren't many realty agents. The ones near 
us aren't very good, so we have decided to sell our property without any agent. 
As a percentage of the sales price, how large an earnest money deposit do you 
think we can get? 
</P>
<P>
A: In dollar amounts, $1,000 to $10,000 are typical earnest money deposits. As 
a percentage of your home's sales price, you would be very lucky to get 5% to 
10% at the time the purchase offer is made. 
</P>
<P>
Include a Financial Contingency in Offer 
</P>
<P>
Q: In a few months we will be ready to buy our first home. By then I should 
receive the inheritance from my late mother. However, it will only give us a 
down payment of about 10%. Although we have already talked with a S &amp; L 
about getting a 90% mortgage and they are very encouraging, how can we be sure 
we will actually get the loan when we need it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Just include a mortgage finance contingency clause in your home purchase 
offer. Be sure it is specific. For example, it might read "This purchase offer 
is contingent upon property and buyer qualifying for a new 30-year first 
mortgage of at least $100,000 with a fixed-interest rate not exceeding 9.75% 
and a monthly principal and interest payment of not more than $859.16." 
</P>
<P>
If the specified loan proves to be unavailable, then you can either accept the 
best available loan or cancel the sale and get your earnest money deposit 
refunded. Ask a real estate attorney to explain further. 
</P>
<P>
When to Buy Foreclosed Property 
</P>
<P>
Q: My wife and I would like to buy our first home. Recently, we attended a free 
90-minute lecture at a local hotel about buying foreclosure houses. The speaker 
made it sound so easy and profitable. But he was from out of town, selling his 
$895 seminar, so he wasn't exactly impartial. Do you think it is wise to buy 
foreclosed houses and how would we go about doing it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, you can make substantial profits buying foreclosed houses. I've bought 
quite a few and they all turned out well. Done correctly, buying foreclosed 
property is like paying the wholesale instead of retail price. However, in some 
towns, such as Dallas and Houston, the market is glutted with foreclosed 
houses, so it is very hard to make profits there. 
</P>
<P>
There are three basic times to buy foreclosure houses: after the default notice 
is recorded but before the foreclosure auction, at the foreclosure sale and if 
there were no bidders, after the foreclosure sale when you can buy the REO 
(real estate owned) from the foreclosing lender. 
</P>
<P>
The advantage of buying before the auction is that you can sometimes pay the 
defaulting owner a few thousand dollars for a quit-claim deed. However, this 
usually doesn't work well if there are many mortgages on the property. But 
buying at the foreclosure auction wipes out the junior loans. The drawback is 
that you'll need cash to buy at the auction. 
</P>
<P>
I prefer to buy after the auction, if there were no bidders, at a good price 
from the foreclosing lender, who usually will finance the sale on attractive 
terms such as 5% or 10% down payment. However, I stay away from VA and FHA 
foreclosures because these houses are usually offered at full retail value. 
</P>
<P>
Tax Pitfalls When Refinancing Home 
</P>
<P>
Q: Did I understand your recent article correctly that if I refinance the 
mortgage on my home to take out some tax-free cash, I can only deduct the 
interest on an additional home-equity $100,000 maximum loan? 
</P>
<P>
My first mortgage is paid down to about $18,652 and the house is worth at least 
$200,000. My bank will loan me up to $150,000, which would net me around 
$131,348. But are you telling me I can deduct interest only on $100,000 
additional and I could not deduct itemized interest on $31,348? 
</P>
<P>
A: I regret to report you understand the bleak picture perfectly. In 1986 and 
1987, Congress reduced the maximum income tax rate but they also took away 
important tax benefits, such as full deductibility of home mortgage interest. 
</P>
<P>
It Makes Sense to to Lease Your Home 
</P>
<P>
Q: Some time ago, you wrote that it makes sense to rent the home where I live, 
but you also said I should own a rental house held for investment. You 
suggested that a reader move out of his house, rent it to tenants, and then 
rent a similar nearby house where he would live. Please clarify. 
</P>
<P>
A: On an out-of-pocket basis, it is usually cheaper to rent a house than to own 
that same house. In most communities, the reason is that rents are lower than 
mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
For example, I recently rented a house to a tenant for $1,500 per month. With a 
10% down payment, the monthly mortgage payment on that same house, including 
property taxes, would be about $2,600. But I have owned that house for many 
years, so my payments are not that high. 
</P>
<P>
My suggestion is to rent your home to tenants and move into the nicest rental 
house you can afford. Perhaps you would enjoy one with a swimming pool, tennis 
courts and four garages. You will be surprised how cheaply lavish mansions can 
be rented. Another benefit is that the owner pays for the maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you have a modest negative cash flow from renting your old home, after 
computing the income tax savings from the loss and the depreciation deduction, 
you should come out about even. However, you will be making a profit if the 
house appreciates in market value. 
</P>
<P>
I learned this concept from Jack Miller of Tampa and John Schaub of Sarasota, 
Fla. But they are quick to emphasize that although renting the house where you 
live makes financial sense, most people do not want to live in a home they are 
not buying. This is the big hang-up to renting the residence where you now live 
and owning other investment property to provide a cash-flow tax loss. I admit 
that while this concept makes sense, I prefer living in a home I own. 
</P>
<P>
Road Easement Has to Be in Writing 
</P>
<P>
Q: Several months ago, I bought some rural land which adjoins property I 
already own. When discussing the sale, the neighbor agreed to give me a road 
easement over the land he still owns. This will save me from driving several 
extra miles to get to the nearest town. However, in looking over the deed to 
the land I bought I don't see anything about an easement. Should there be some 
mention of the road easement? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. You not only purchased the land but a road easement over the neighbor's 
adjoining land which he retained. Your deed should describe the land you bought 
plus the easement over the adjoining land, called the servient tenement. 
Consult the person who handled the transaction, such as a real estate attorney, 
title or escrow officer. I hope you bought an owner's title policy. If so, you 
should be protected.

SAM HALL KAPLAN: 'TIS THE SEASON FOR GIFT BOOK GIVING TO THE MOVERS, SHAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Combining the spirit of this holiday season with the spirit of this column, it 
is time once again to suggest gift books for a select few involved with the 
drift of architecture, planning and design in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the books are new, although a few have been recycled from holidays 
past. Each in their way has a message, if only in the title. 
</P>
<P>
To Mayor Tom Bradley: "The Living City" by Roberta Brandes Gratz (Simon &amp; 
Schuster), a well-documented plea for thinking small and being sensitive to the 
potential of historic preservation and community concerns, with a view toward 
injecting new life into tired cities (and perhaps also into tired mayors). 
</P>
<P>
To John Tuite, head of the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency: "City: 
Rediscovering the Center" by William H. Whyte (Doubleday), an insightful 
exploration of why some downtowns work as people places, chock-full of ideas 
that don't need a city council's approval. 
</P>
<P>
To Kenneth Topping, Los Angeles planning director: "How to Save Your Own 
Street" by Raquel Ramati (Doubleday). Although nearly 10 years old, and 
fashioned for New York City, the book's focus and its detailing of street-wise 
planning tools are very applicable to Los Angeles now, and a not-so-subtle plea 
for some "get down" microplanning. 
</P>
<P>
To Topping's patient staff, and persevering planners everywhere: "Right Before 
Your Eyes: Penetrating the Urban Environment" by Grady Clay (APA Planners 
Press), a collection of relaxed essays that engagingly relates planning and 
design to everyday places and events. 
</P>
<P>
To Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman: "Los Angeles in the Thirties: 
1931-1941" by David Gebhard and Harriette Von Breton (Hennessey &amp; Ingalls), 
a revised and enlarged new edition of an informed and evocative view of the 
city's embrace of the Moderne-styled decade. 
</P>
<P>
On the cover is a photograph of the Pan Pacific Auditorium, one of the period's 
architectural gems. For nearly 10 years, the landmark deteriorated while the 
supervisor procrastinated over its fate, until fate stepped in and it was 
destroyed by fire. 
</P>
<P>
To Los Angeles Councilman John Ferraro, who no doubt will have to arbitrate 
various controversial proposals to redevelop sections of the Fairfax District: 
"Every Goy's Guide to Common Jewish Expressions," by Arthur Naiman 
(Ballantine). 
</P>
<P>
And as the paperback blurb says: "Also recommended for Jews who don't know 
their punim from their pupik." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, of the adjoining district, no doubt knows the 
difference, so to him, along with colleagues Marvin Braude, Gloria Molina and 
Hal Bernson, goes: "Density By Design," edited by James Wentling and Lloyd 
Bookout (Urban Land Institute). Included is a selection of case studies of the 
trend toward more dense residential projects, with a knowing nod to community, 
political, financial and market considerations. 
</P>
<P>
At $48, "Density by Design" is a little pricey, but I'm sure the former head of 
the city's Planning Commission, Dan Garcia, would be happy to put it on his 
gift list. To Garcia, who now counsels developers, goes: "Icons and Aliens: 
Law, Aesthetics, and Environmental Change" by John Costonis (University of 
Illinois Press). 
</P>
<P>
A copy also goes to Councilman Mike Woo, along with: "Holly wood: Legend and 
Reality," (New York Graphic Society). 
</P>
<P>
To Richard Weinstein, Bob Harris and Michael Rotundi, the trio of local 
architecture school deans who form the core of the Mayor's Design Advisory 
Committee: "Architecture: Meaning and Place," by Christian Norberg-Schulz, 
(Rizzoli). This is a heady compilation of essays and lectures that attempts to 
put architecture into a proper perspective. 
</P>
<P>
To Gary Squier, Arnold Stalk, the L.A. Family Housing Corp. and the L.A. 
Community Design Cen ter, to aid them in their continuing noble struggle for 
decent housing: 'Reweaving the Urban Fabric," (Princeton Architectural Press). 
The book explores the siting, design and development of quality, affordable 
housing within existing neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
To Scott Johnson, Richard Keating, Herb Nadel and Tom Landau, among other local 
architects whose bent it is to scrape the skies with their buildings: "Towers: 
A Historical Survey" by Erwin Heinle and Fritz Leonhardt (Rizzoli), a 
well-illustrated survey of the construction of every conceivable high-rise 
through the ages and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
To Frank Gehry, Eric Owen Moss, Janek Bielski, Frank Israel, Michele Saee and 
other local designers who are arbitrarily, and at times capriciously, labeled 
avant-garde: "Social Design: Creating Buildings with People in Mind" by Robert 
Sommer (Prentice Hall). The text points the way to more user-oriented and 
environmentally sound designs; designs that are humanistic as well as 
sculptural. 
</P>
<P>
As for clients thinking of hiring a brand-name designer, or for that matter any 
designer, to have a house built, expanded or renovated: "The Well-Built House" 
by Jim Locke (Houghton-Mifflin), is a down-to-earth, easy-to-follow guide that 
asks the right questions of the client, the architect and the contractor. 
</P>
<P>
To Jay Rounds, Claire Bogaard and other indefatigable preservationists: 
"Picture Palaces," "Ducks &amp; Diners" and "Mostly Moderne," (Preservation 
Press), collections of postcards featuring views of assorted landmarks, ready 
to be mailed to whatever public official or agency happens at the moment to be 
thwarting preservation through their actions or inactions. 
</P>
<P>
To Mitzi Mogul of Heritage Square, and the stalwarts of Carroll Avenue and 
environs: "The Victo 
</P>
<P>
rian House Book," by Robin Guild (Rizzoli), a sumptuous guide to the varied 
styles and designs of the period, plus some sage, if pricey, renovating and 
decorating ideas. 
</P>
<P>
To Kurt Meyer, who because of the time he donates to various urban design 
concerns here deserves a diversion elsewhere: "Andrea Palladio: The Complete 
Works," by Lionello Puppi, (Rizzoli), a detailed review of the works of the 
Italian master architect. 
</P>
<P>
Also, because of their public service on behalf of the design profession, to 
Barton Myers, Bill Fain, Fernando Juarez, Ray Gaio, Chet Widom and Edward 
Friedrichs go copies of "Architectural Practice: A Critical View," by Robert 
Gutman, (Princeton). 
</P>
<P>
And to all my readers, on this the day before Christmas and the second day of 
Hanukkah, happy holidays.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: HOME IMPROVEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
HOUSEPLANTS CAN HELP CLEAR THE AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY, Dulley is a Cincinnati-based engineering consultant. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I have an energy-efficient house. During the colder weather, it gets 
stuffy and I don't feel as good as I usually do. Is there any energy-efficient 
method to improve the air quality without investing a lot in special systems? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: The most energy-efficient and inexpensive method to improve the air 
quality in your home is to reduce the amount of pollutants you put into the 
air. There has also been some recent research done which shows that certain 
varieties of common houseplants can help purify indoor air. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the chemicals from cleaners, waxes, and materials in your home may 
build up and actually make you feel ill, irritable and depressed. When you are 
doing polluting activities like cooking, cleaning or painting, operate an 
exhaust vent fan. Close the doors to that room and crack open a window just a 
little to reduce the loss of heated air from the rest of your home. 
</P>
<P>
Replace synthetic household cleaners and materials in your home with natural 
ones. For example, polyester curtains or vinyl shades can give off fumes when 
heated by the sun. Cotton or wood is better. If you dry-clean curtains, hang 
them outdoors first before rehanging them. 
</P>
<P>
You can use a water/vinegar solution to clean greasy film from a vinyl floor. 
Then use club soda to polish the floor. You can clean tar off a floor by first 
scraping off the excess with a knife. Then rub it vigorously with a dry cloth 
and butter or margarine. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of using spray cleaners and polishes, you can remove water marks from 
furniture naturally. Mix a small amount of wood ash with cooking oil and apply 
with a soft cloth. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has done research 
using houseplants to remove such harmful chemicals as formaldehyde and benzene 
from indoor air. Certain common houseplants, such as the spider plant, have 
been found to be particularly effective for purifying the air naturally. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to removing indoor pollution and producing oxygen, indoor plants 
add needed moisture in the winter. You should place the plants in areas where 
air circulates, perhaps a hallway or near a return register. 
</P>
<P>
There are companies that produce completely natural cleaners, waxes, adhesives, 
paints and even shoe polishes. Some use only coconut oil as a base, no 
petrochemicals, and the products are totally biodegradable. They are available 
through health food outlets and by mail order. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 382, which includes "low-tox" 
cleaning tips, a list of 10 house plants useful for purifying air and a list of 
manufacturers of natural cleaners and products. Please include $1 and a 
self-addressed business-sized envelope. Send your requests to James Dulley, c/o 
The Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244. 
</P>
<P>
Lower Setting Is Best on Home Thermostat 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently installed a computerized setback thermostat that allows for four 
different temperature settings at four different times of the day. Is it 
possible to set it too low and waste energy heating it up again? 
</P>
<P>
A: With most furnaces -- gas, oil or electric -- the lower you set your 
thermostat, the better. Heat loss is a function of the temperature difference 
between indoor and outdoor air. If the temperature difference is less, then the 
heat loss is less. 
</P>
<P>
Even with a heat pump thermostat, setting it back too much at night may not 
yield savings as great as you anticipate. In the morning, when the outdoor 
temperature is lowest, the heat pump may not be able to heat your house quickly 
enough. Then the expensive back-up resistance heater may kick on.

WILDLIFE GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for the article on Stephanie Lynn's Bel-Air garden "A Garden for the 
Birds -- and Other Wildlife" by Robert Smaus (Nov. 19). How lovely to read of 
this woman's compassion for the neighboring creatures, and her non-chemical 
approach to gardening. One hopes her great success will prompt others to 
dispense with spraying, poisoning and other traditional methods in favor of 
more harmonious solutions.

THREAT TO BALANCE OF FAIRFAX AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bravo to Sam Hall Kaplan in capturing the essence of the Fairfax neighborhood 
and the threat to its "sense of place" as we've known it ("Sensitivity Needed 
to Retain Fairfax Area's Sense of Place," Dec. 17). 
</P>
<P>
While it has been the soul of L.A.'s Jewish community for more than five 
decades, the Fairfax area has also been home to a mixture of age groups and 
income levels, all living in the same neighborhood. This is a unique phenomenon 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Fairfax has provided a "senior-friendly" environment for a 
growing elderly population and affordable housing and social services have been 
the area's mainstay. It has also been a neighborhood in which young couples and 
families have chosen to start their lives together. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, there has been a delicate balance between the availability 
of affordable housing and the pressures of gentrification, which prices low- 
and middle-income persons out of their homes and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
There has also been a balance between neighborhood-oriented commercial shops 
(e.g. Fairfax between Beverly and Melrose) and regional needs such as the May 
Co. Wilshire store or the old Ohrbach's. It is this balance that is 
fundamentally threatened by the two development projects being proposed by 
Farmers Market and Forest City Dillon (Park La Brea). 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, a major new regional retail mall, three high-rise office buildings, 
two new hotels, and more than 2,300 new residential units in Third and Fairfax 
area would be a mortal blow to one of the great neighborhoods in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax area streets cannot possibly absorb the added 50,000 automobile trips 
that would be generated, and the socio-economic balance of the neighborhood 
cannot survive the pressures of gentrification which would ensue. 
</P>
<P>
The city, the neighborhood and the developer of these two projects need to plan 
the future of these properties together and with sensitivity toward that which 
makes Fairfax unique. To accomplish this, the developers must first set their 
sights much lower as to what is the appropriate intensity of development at the 
strategic corner of 3rd and Fairfax.

EXCHANGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here's some important news regarding tax-deferred real estate exchanges that 
should interest many of your readers. Those who followed the progress of tax 
law changes this year know that last July the House of Representatives passed a 
bill to require that property transferred and property acquired in a 
"like-kind" property exchange under Section 1031 of the tax code must be 
"similar or related in service or use." This threatened to prevent swaps 
between different types of property. 
</P>
<P>
But the day before Thanksgiving, Congress dropped the proposed restrictions and 
left the meaning of "like-kind" right where it's been for years. So virtually 
any type of real estate held for business use or investment can still be traded 
tax-free for any other real estate. In simple terms, you can still trade an 
investment condo for a shopping center or an office building for raw land, or 
apartments for an industrial building, or any other combination you can 
imagine. 
</P>
<P>
Congress also left open the minimum holding time before property can be 
exchanged. The House had proposed a one-year minimum, but this too was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
However, the new law has imposed tough new restrictions on exchanges involving 
"related persons," so readers should consult with their tax advisers to make 
sure they properly arrange their trades with an independent party to avoid this 
trap. Family members, trusts and related corporations are particularly 
dangerous trading partners now.

WHEN A NON-ASSUMABLE LOAN IS ASSUMABLE; 
</P>
<P>
LEGAL RIGHTS: THERE ARE SEVEN SITUATIONS UNDER A 1982 LAW WHEN PROPERTY CAN BE 
TRANSFERRED WITHOUT NEED TO REFINANCE. 
</P>

<P>
Your elderly father died, willing his home to you. It will be perfect for you 
and your family. But the mortgage lender says you can't take over the 7% 
interest-rate mortgage. Don't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
Or imagine that you and your joint-tenant friend co-owner invested in property 
together. Your friend dies. The mortgage lender wants you to pay off the old 8% 
interest-rate mortgage. Don't do it. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose you and your spouse get a divorce and you receive title to the house. 
The lender insists that you pay off the old low-interest-rate mortgage. You 
don't have to. 
</P>
<P>
In the three situations above, thanks to the 1982 Garn-St. Germain Law, the 
lender cannot force the borrower to pay off the mortgage even if it contains a 
due on sale clause. 
</P>
<P>
There are seven situations where a non-assumable mortgage can be assumed. If 
you know your legal rights, you can assume an existing mortgage without lender 
interference. Here are the seven most common situations where you can avoid 
paying off an existing mortgage: 
</P>
<P>
When there is no due on sale clause. Many mortgage lenders instruct their loan 
service clerks to tell borrowers every existing mortgage cannot be assumed when 
a property title is transferred. This is not correct. The most obvious 
situation where a mortgage can be assumed by a new owner occurs when there is 
no due on sale clause. Always get a copy of the mortgage or trust deed to check 
if there is a due on sale clause. If there is none, the lender cannot demand 
payment when the property title is transferred. 
</P>
<P>
When title is transferred by interhitance to a new owner-occupant relative. 
When a property owner dies, if a relative inherits the property and occupies 
it, the mortgage lender cannot enforce a due on sale clause. However, if the 
inheriting relative does not occupy the residence, then the lender can call the 
loan if it has a due on sale clause. 
</P>
<P>
* When a surviving joint tenant takes over ownership. If one joint tenant 
co-owner dies, the mortgage lender cannot enforce a due on sale clause and 
demand that the surviving joint tenant pay off the mortgage. It doesn't matter 
whether or not the joint tenants were relatives. 
</P>
<P>
* When a new junior mortgage is recorded on the property. Surprisingly, many 
mortgages have a "due on encumbrance" clause that says the first mortgage 
lender can call the loan if a second mortgage is recorded on the property. But 
the Garn-St. Germain Law prohibits enforcement of such a clause. 
</P>
<P>
* When a divorce results in transfer to either a spouse or an offspring. If a 
divorce results in a title transfer to either an owner-occupant ex-spouse or to 
children of the marriage, then the lender cannot enforce the due on sale 
clause. 
</P>
<P>
* When property is leased for less than three years and there is no purchase 
option. Some due on sale clauses allow the lender to call the loan if the 
property is leased without the lender's permission. However, the Garn-St. 
Germain Law bars lenders from enforcing such a clause if the lease is less than 
three years and the tenant does not have a purchase option. 
</P>
<P>
* When title is transferred into an inter vivos living trust. For estate 
planning purposes and to avoid probate costs, many smart property owners place 
their properties in an inter vivos living trust. Such a title transfer will not 
trigger the due on sale clause when the borrower is the beneficiary and 
continues occupying the property. 
</P>
<P>
Many mortgage lenders routinely tell borrowers their mortgage must be paid off 
when title to the property is transferred. But an advantageous existing 
mortgage can be called by the lender only if the situation does not fall into 
one of the circumstances outlined above. Further details are available from a 
real estate attorney.

FUNDS AWARDED BY GREAT WESTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Great Western Financial Corp. has awarded a total of $125,000 to two Southland 
organizations for their efforts to provide affordable housing for low-income 
people. 
</P>
<P>
The Watts Labor Community Action Committee plans to use the $75,000 it received 
to complete the renovation of a family housing shelter in South-Central Los 
Angeles. The Westminster Neighborhood Assn. will use its $50,000 gift to manage 
a 130-unit apartment complex it is building and to plan additional housing 
developments in Watts and surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
The contributions are part of Great Western's annual Leslie N. Shaw Sr. 
Memorial Awards, named after the man who served as the company's vice president 
and director of community development for 16 years. Another grant of $75,000 
was made to the Mid-Peninsula Housing Coalition in Palo Alto, which is working 
to preserve federally subsidized housing.

HER WORLD: SILENT NIGHTS AND HOLLY DAYS ABOARD SHIP OFF ANTARCTICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The carols began playing over the ship's public-address system on the day 
before Christmas, and as usual, with those holiday tapes, every fifth melody 
was "The Little Drummer Boy." 
</P>
<P>
Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum. 
</P>
<P>
I sat alone by a window in the ship's lounge and, over the top of a book by the 
explorer Ernest Shackleton, I stared at the ice of Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
It was the most peaceful Christmas Eve I'd ever known; quiet, cozy, 
uncomplicated. No rushing. No shopping. No open houses. And too cold to go 
outside and play. 
</P>
<P>
Across the lounge, three white-haired fellows were swapping travel tales. The 
odd exotic word drifted my way: Borneo, Sherpa, Xian. I saw that they were 
listening to each other. There is time for such luxury at sea. 
</P>
<P>
A Christmas Eve without parades -- just a line of crystal fog that drew an 
opaque curtain around our ship, there near the bottom of the world. I pushed my 
book aside and wrapped up in a blanket. 
</P>
<P>
In the library, an Australian rancher was busy with water colors. The ship's 
doctor studied an atlas. A woman from the island of Sark scratched happily at 
post cards, which would not be mailed until we reached Chile in two weeks. ("Of 
course, you may post them at the Polish scientific station on the day after 
Christmas," our leader had said. "But they might not leave Antarctica until a 
supply ship comes in six months.") 
</P>
<P>
Simple acts, if any at all, seemed called for. In my cabin, I cleared a space 
beneath the porthole and arranged five blue limpet shells that I had collected 
in the Falkland Islands. They were keyhole limpets, and I had found a beach 
littered with them, in lavender, rose and blue. 
</P>
<P>
The fog moved closer. We were the center of a small ring of ocean. We were the 
keyhole in the limpet. We were the most people for thousands of miles, the 80 
of us on that ship. 
</P>
<P>
The fog was blinding bright, and when I turned away from the porthole, white 
circles followed, full moons that bounced on the walls and into the mirror, 
like the blue dots that burn in your eyes after a flashbulb pops. 
</P>
<P>
But enough of drifting dreams. I remembered that I had one Christmas errand. I 
needed a snip of tape so that I could attach a sprig of Russell lupine to a 
sack from the Falkland Islands Company store. 
</P>
<P>
The lupine was from the garden of a child named Poppy, whom I met on tiny West 
Point Island. She had handed me a nosegay as I left to sail farther south. 
Packages were adorned with blue petals and green stalks. It seemed wondrous in 
this world of icebergs and glaciers. 
</P>
<P>
As I left for dinner, I saw that a California couple had come prepared. Printed 
cards on each door said: "From our cabin to yours, Merry Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
A fir tree had been decorated in the lounge, and flickered with green and red 
lights. I wondered if it had traveled with us from Uruguay, where we began this 
journey; I had not seen many trees since. 
</P>
<P>
We had breakfast in our cabin on Christmas Day: coffee and hot chocolate, bran 
muffins and orange marmalade, a ripe banana and pears. We traded gifts. I gave 
him a glacial blue marker pen and two linen towels showing Falklands maps and 
penguins. I also gave him a fisherman's sweater, knitted by the wives of Port 
Stanley. 
</P>
<P>
He gave me snow-white long underwear, trimmed at the neckline with lace. Far 
too fancy for the Falklands general store, I thought, and then saw the 
Nordstrom label. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas lunch was a feast of Smithfield ham and roast turkey, baked yams and 
pumpkin pie, homemade ice cream and baklava. It was borne by a Greek named 
Babis, who had brought our breakfast tray. 
</P>
<P>
After the last hearty toast, we put on red parkas and walked out on the 
sun-splashed deck. It was warmer now, and snow was beginning to fall. Fat 
flakes stuck to our hair and wool gloves. 
</P>
<P>
Music began booming from the loudspeaker.

SPIRITUAL BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I fail to understand the logic of the biased headline "Religion is Big Business 
at the Shrine of Lourdes" (Dec. 3), based on the article by Phillippe Naughton. 
I had the privilege of visiting Lourdes twice, spending up to 12 hours a day in 
prayer and public devotions -- even forgoing lunch in order to treasure each 
spiritual moment. 
</P>
<P>
Pilgrims visiting Lourdes are there for the spiritual benefits. In the 
religious domain of Lourdes, one may obtain blessed candles and mass offerings 
can be made. Neither is obligatory and there are no collections. The church has 
nothing to do with the commercial aspects outside the grotto grounds.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: IF THE PLANE BUCKS, IT'S BETTER TO BE BUCKLED-UP; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: THE REAL DANGER WHEN FLYING IS FROM UNEXPECTED MODERATE TO SEVERE 
IN-FLIGHT TURBULENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're like most airline passengers, you board your airplane, stow your 
carry-on baggage, take your seat and fasten your seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
About two to three minutes into most flights, the captain will turn off the 
"Fasten Seat Belt" sign. Being an obedient passenger, you unbuckle your seat 
belt. 
</P>
<P>
That could be a big mistake. When you least expect it, the plane could be 
buffeted by moderate to severe turbulence, and you could seriously injure 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Although most airlines don't like to publicize it, there is a real danger of 
passenger accidents resulting from in-flight turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 24, 1983, an Air Canada L-1011 flying above South Carolina encountered 
turbulence. Twenty-five passengers were injured, five of them seriously. 
</P>
<P>
On March 3, 1986, near Honolulu, nine passengers were hurt (two seriously) on a 
United Airlines 747 that was hit by turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
On July 13, 1986, an Eastern Airlines A300 flying near West Palm Beach, Fla., 
was rocked by turbulence. Thirty passengers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 11, 1987, a Pan Am A300 flying across the Atlantic was also hit by 
severe turbulence. Thirty-five passengers were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
In almost every case, the passengers injured were not wearing seat belts when 
the turbulence occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Officially, these are classified as "Part 121" accidents, meaning an accident 
in which there are passenger or crew injuries or substantial damage to an 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, different kinds of turbulence. Turbulence can be created 
by weather fronts and storms, by the vortices of exhaust from airplanes in 
front of you, or the most severe -- and usually unexpected -- kind: CAT, or 
clear-air turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
Weather experts say that turbulence occurs when warm and cold air masses 
collide near the jet stream at the cold/warm air boundary. They will also tell 
you that turbulence occurs more often during the winter months, due to 
seasonally colder air temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, forecasting turbulence is an iffy business," according to Ken Plunkett, 
director of research for the nonprofit Aviation Safety Institute in 
Worthington, Ohio. "The FAA will issue reports of suspected turbulence, but 
more often than not they are general in nature." 
</P>
<P>
For example, the FAA might warn pilots of suspected turbulence in a large 
geographic grid stretching from Michigan to Florida at altitudes 18,000 to 
47,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Other turbulence warnings come from "Pireps" -- pilot reports filed by captains 
flying either immediately in front of you or in the general vicinity of your 
airspace. 
</P>
<P>
"But the problem," said John Galipault, president of ASI, "is that no one 
agency, airline or pilot can really anticipate when turbulence will occur. 
Airlines are very good at making people fasten their seat belts for takeoffs 
and landings, but what about in-flight? 
</P>
<P>
"Most fliers take for granted that once an aircraft is flying at its cruising 
speed, nothing short of a crash will significantly disrupt the flight. That's 
not true. Few airlines promote the idea of keeping passenger seat belts 
fastened securely at all times because they're afraid it might worry 
passengers." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, you should be worried about what could happen if you don't keep your 
belt fastened during the flight. 
</P>
<P>
Plunkett recently studied data from the National Transportation Safety Board 
indicating that nearly 25% of all airliner accidents between 1983 and 1988 
involved in-flight turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
Not only were passengers seriously injured, but flight attendants were 
especially vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, an airplane might suddenly lose altitude. When that happens, 
flight attendants in the aisles -- as well as unrestrained passengers -- hit 
the ceiling . . . literally. 
</P>
<P>
As the pilot fights to regain control and return to altitude, those flight 
attendants and passengers are often thrown to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Again, having your seat belt fastened is only part of the solution. You must 
fasten it tightly. "On one flight when we hit turbulence," said Lenore Kadish, 
a TWA flight attendant, "an elderly woman who had fastened her seat belt was 
pulled out of her seat by a sudden loss of altitude. 
</P>
<P>
"When she hit the floor, it started to happen again. The only thing that saved 
her was that other passengers grabbed her and held her down until things 
smoothed out." 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, policies about seat belts vary from airline to airline. 
Some airlines politely suggest that you keep the belts loosely fastened. Other 
airlines insist that their flight attendants adhere to a strict employee 
seat-belt rule. 
</P>
<P>
"I was astounded when I came to work for this airline," said flight attendant 
Susan Marshall, who joined Delta Airlines after flying for another carrier for 
many years. 
</P>
<P>
"My previous airline was very lax about what flight attendants could and 
couldn't do at various stages of the flight. Delta is unbelievably cautious 
about flight attendants wearing seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, we are not allowed to get up from our seats until the seat-belt 
sign goes off. The same rule applies when the plane is taxiing. It's an 
important rule, and I'd like to see other airlines adopt it." 
</P>
<P>
But what about new rules for passengers? 
</P>
<P>
For the moment, to protect yourself, don't wait for the FAA. Abide by your own 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
Unless you have to go to the bathroom, keep your belt tightly fastened. And on 
longer flights, if you want to sleep, fasten your seat belt on the outside of 
your blanket, where it is clearly visible to flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
If you find yourself in severe turbulence -- and assuming you've already 
fastened your seat belt -- quickly bury your head in your arms. That way, you 
can also minimize the damage caused by objects flying through the cabin.

BORSCHT TO A 'T' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding "Taking a Camp Look at Search for Borscht" (Nov. 12): One of life's 
puzzling mysteries for me has been trying to find out why people spell the name 
of the well-known soup, borscht, with a "t" at the end. This soup, indigenous 
to Slavic nations, has no "t" in its Cyrillic spelling. Only non-Slavic people 
stick that letter at the end and it makes absolutely no sense to have it there. 
If someone pronounces it with a "t", they are not pronouncing "borshch" 
correctly. 
</P>
<P>
"Borshch" was originally developed in the Ukraine and there is a basic, 
classical version of this delicious soup. Like everything else to which the 
people of Russia have helped themselves, including vodka, which originated in 
Poland, they labeled "borshch" as Russian. But we know better, don't we?

A SOVIET VIEW OF USING FORCE AS FOREIGN POLICY;

PANAMA: U.S. INTERVENTION SEEMS ANOTHER MANIFESTATION OF AMERICAN PROVINCIALISM 
-- BELIEF THAT REGIONAL POLICIES CAN BE SEPARATED FROM GLOBAL POLICIES.

<P>
The American intervention in Panama has shown once again that traditional 
approaches to foreign-policy problems are still in vogue in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
I am not a fan of Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, but neither his background nor 
methods of leadership can justify U.S. interventionism. It is especially 
regretful that the action in Panama is overwhelmingly supported by the U.S. 
public -- just as it was six years ago in the case of Grenada. Nations and 
peoples do not change their habits very fast. And that is why I would not like 
to sound too optimistic about Soviet-American relations by stating that all the 
current changes in these relations are already irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. intervention seems to be another manifestation of American 
provincialism -- belief that the regional policies of the United States can be 
separated from its global policies. But this is not possible in our 
interdependent world, and the use of force even at such a low level in Central 
America will inevitably echo in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
For centuries the most reliable, realistic means of assuring national security 
was deemed to be stockpiling more arms and achieving military superiority over 
potential enemies. But nowadays betting on such superiority is extremely 
dangerous and illusory, politically counterproductive and economically ruinous. 
</P>
<P>
If in the past military force was the main instrument of Realpolitik -- and war 
was its continuation by other means -- now it has become impossible to achieve 
political aims by resort to force in any conflict larger than Grenada or the 
Falklands. 
</P>
<P>
In the Soviet view, a shift to consistent realism has implied, among other 
things, an understanding that our own interests will not be served by American 
difficulties, especially in the regions that are especially sensitive to the 
United States. In recent months Americans have begun to think more seriously 
about this, particularly in regard to Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
There are few nations in the world other than the Soviet Union and the United 
States whose joint and parallel interests outweigh any real causes for 
conflict, tension and confrontation between them. 
</P>
<P>
Economically, the Soviet Union and the United States complement rather than 
oppose each other. As for ideological differences, I have never thought of them 
as an imperative source of divisions and collisions between the two nations. 
Ideology may play such a role only at the primitive levels of societal 
development, when fanaticism and prejudice get the upper hand. We should not 
forget, however, that ideology was frequently used as casus belli for conflicts 
and wars to cover up for other much more fundamental and deep-rooted causes. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of "de-ideologizing" international relations and overcoming dogmatic 
stereotypes and prejudices in world politics has already been introduced into 
official Soviet foreign-policy doctrine and has become a key element of Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev's New Thinking. By the same token, it appears that fascination 
with ideology and ideological "crusades" is falling out of fashion in the 
United States, while pragmatism begins to play a more important role in foreign 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
However, as Panama reminds us, there still exists an area of Soviet-American 
relations that during the postwar period was a constant and often highly 
dangerous source of conflicts and tensions: our positions in controversies and 
conflicts that flared up in various regions of the world. 
</P>
<P>
It is on this ground that the worst crises in Soviet-American relations took 
place. It is here that the foundations for mutual trust were undermined. But 
looking at world politics of the last four years, we see that the number of 
arenas for Soviet-American confrontation have dwindled considerably. Humanity 
has tired of conflicts, civil wars, extremism of right and left. Ideas of 
national reconciliation are gaining momentum in Central America, Afghanistan, 
South Africa and Indochina. To my mind, reduction of world tensions is a 
natural process closely linked to overcoming the bipolar system of the Cold 
War. 
</P>
<P>
By rejecting blind confrontation and "zero-sum game" approaches to 
policy-making, by reassessing the need to respond in kind to any action of the 
opposite side, we may take a more realistic look at our own interests in this 
world and understand them better. Thus we may come to understand that the era 
of empires is over, that the cost of maintaining empires is rising while 
benefits are diminishing. We may also realize that acute Soviet-American 
confrontation creates a situation where both powers may be dragged into local 
conflicts even against their will, or where third countries may use these 
circumstances in their egotistic interests, creating instances where the tail 
wags the dog. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, we may realize that the Third World would rather be neither Soviet 
nor American, that it develops for its own sake and in its own interests, 
according to its own laws, and any attempts to interfere in this development 
and shape it according to the wishes of a great power are usually 
counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever your attitude, the Cold War is dying, if only because it takes two to 
tango -- and the Soviet Union has adopted a firm decision to opt out of this 
dangerous and ruinous game. As I told Americans two years ago, we have deprived 
the United States of the "enemy." That brings about tremendous overall changes 
-- in traditional political perceptions and institutions that try, for example, 
to substantiate the rationale of the arms race and of military alliances. A 
great many things lose the very foundations of their existence. 
</P>
<P>
However, no one should forget that the Cold War lasted for more than four 
decades. Cumbersome structures were erected, huge mechanisms of confrontation 
were set in motion. Dismantling these structures and mechanisms and defusing 
the time bombs scattered all over the world can be done more efficiently if the 
United States and the Soviet Union act together -- of course with the 
participation of allies and friends of both countries. 
</P>
<P>
Joint Soviet-American efforts had slowed in this area during the 12 months 
before the Malta summit. The summit, with its decisive shift toward common 
sense in Soviet-U.S. relations, should give them a new impetus -- particularly 
for treaties on strategic and conventional weapons. If the leaders of both 
countries are true to their word and their agreement, we may hope that 1990 
will go down in history as the Disarmament Year. This would not only mean 
overcoming the numerous technical obstacles that diplomats in Geneva and Vienna 
are struggling with, but that both sides would support the negotiations by 
exercising restraint in military appropriations and programs. In the long run, 
these policies are even more important than the agreements -- which only fix 
what has already been accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
At Malta, the United States declared in effect that it is ready to terminate 
the economic war against the Soviet Union. I hope this important declaration 
will soon be interpreted in practical policy and that the new opportunities for 
action in many areas will not be missed this time around. Let us also hope that 
neither President Bush nor President Gorbachev will yield to pressure and 
attacks from their conservative critics. So much depends on this.

HISTORY: SINCE THE GREEKS, HUMANS HAVE SOUGHT THE 'LAWS' OF HISTORY. BUT THERE 
IS ONLY ONE LAW, AND IT EXPLAINS THE DOWNFALL OF COMMUNISM.

<P>
A historian cannot observe the momentous events of the last few months in 
Eastern Europe or, indeed, perestroika and glasnost, which opened the way for 
them, without being greatly instructed as to the nature of history herself -- 
of Clio, Queen of the Muses. 
</P>
<P>
First, it must be said that the distinguishing feature of history is that it is 
full of surprises. The most renowned expert, the most farsighted prognosticator 
cannot anticipate the future. We have no idea what the future holds in store 
for us. The future, Robert Frost wrote, is given form by our faith. We believe 
the future into existence. Why then can we not predict it? Well, for one thing, 
our moods are too transitory and unpredictable. We are too fickle and faithless 
to be relied upon. 
</P>
<P>
Since the time of the ancient Greeks, human beings, especially male human 
beings, have found the obscurity of the future maddening. They have shown 
remarkable ingenuity in trying to discover the "laws" of history. The Greeks 
(and to a degree, the Romans) believed that time was cyclical, that nations 
were compelled to go through preordained cycles -- from democracy (which 
invariably degenerated into anarchy), to dictatorship (which was legitimated 
into monarchy), to oligarchy (the rule of a rich and powerful class made 
restive by the arbitrary dictates of the king). And so on, forever. 
</P>
<P>
Christianity, by anticipating an end to time, the Day of Judgment, attacked the 
pagan notion of endlessly recurring cycles and "straightened history out," so 
to speak. Humanity was not condemned to endless repetition; there could be 
change and progress toward a clearer idea of God's intentions for man. 
</P>
<P>
In the 19th Century, the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel 
propounded his "dialectical" view of history. The dialectic consisted of a 
thesis (the dominant consciousness of the age) and an antithesis (a set of 
opposing propositions). Out of the struggle between the established thesis and 
its challenger, the antithesis, would come a new synthesis that combined the 
most enduring values of the rival creeds. Hegel's theory of the dialectic was 
one of the great creative notions in all of history -- in part at least because 
it involved the principle of incorporation. The synthesis was larger, more 
comprehensive, more generous, if you will, than the rival systems. The 
synthesis, in turn, became a thesis and was once again challenged by a new 
antithesis. 
</P>
<P>
I have always found Hegel's system a most fruitful one. Unfortunately, Karl 
Marx did too. He adapted Hegel's dialectic, with bourgeoise capitalism as the 
thesis. The antithesis was communism, which must utilize the technological 
skills of capitalism and place them in the service of the classless society, 
run by and for the benefit of all, but especially for the benefit of the 
workers. Millions of men and women were enthralled by the prospect of a society 
without class strife, with jobs for all and communist equality. 
</P>
<P>
Marxian communism, moreover, came forward under the banner of the new religion 
of science. No wonder it had an enormous attraction. It must be kept in mind 
that the economist system (thesis) it opposed (capitalism) was the most brutal 
and exploitative system yet invented by the race. It condemned millions to 
lives of desperate poverty and crushing toil so that a relative few might live 
in the luxury of Oriental potentates. 
</P>
<P>
Of course it did more than that. It developed a remarkable technology, 
theoretically at least capable of supplying the needs of all the inhabitants of 
the globe, and a large and productive (and prosperous) middle class, a 
substantial number of whom, appalled at its excesses and inequities, became 
socialists of one kind or another and some of whom became communists (in the 
U.S. very few workers did). In any event, all the true believers in Marxism 
were assured that communism was the scientifically inevitable wave of the 
future. It might be resisted or abetted but it could not be deflected. 
</P>
<P>
I mention all this because the Marxian dialectic is only the most recent of the 
"laws of history" and, one might add, one of the shortest-lived. 
</P>
<P>
There is, in fact, as far as I can discern, only one law of history. It was 
simply stated by the English historian-philosopher Lord Acton more than 100 
years ago: "Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely." 
Although Acton put the idea in its most familiar form, it is an idea at least 
as old as classical times. The Greeks expressed it in the idea of hubris, or 
pride. Success, wealth, power brought in their train hubris. The human who 
sought and achieved power and wealth challenged the gods and they, angry at 
such human presumption, brought the pretender down in ignominy. 
</P>
<P>
Christians called it "original sin," the disposition of the individual to 
prefer his will to the will of God. Every individual was born with this taint 
of sin, deriving from Adam's original disobedience. The most common political 
manifestation was the proclivity of humans to abuse power and indulge selfish 
desires rather than seeking the common good. 
</P>
<P>
If the law that "power corrupts" is the only irrefutably established law of 
history, it has a number of corollaries. In the words of the British historian 
E.L. Woodward, "Everything good has to be done over again, forever." Daunting, 
in one way, encouraging in another, Woodward's axiom follows naturally from our 
disposition to abuse power. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Founding Fathers' acute awareness of this law that prompted them to 
try to devise a constitution that would prevent any class or interest from 
exploiting any other. Gouverneur Morris reminded the delegates that the rich 
had always exploited the poor -- no reason to think that they would be any less 
inclined to do so in a republic than in a monarchy. The only remedy was to 
hedge the rich with constitutional constraints. There was, of course, no 
guarantee that human ingenuity could devise effective limitations, but it was 
worth trying. 
</P>
<P>
So what do we have? No laws of history but a single law and a number of 
corollaries, among them the assumption that democracy is the best system for 
calling the powerful to account. There is also the related idea of rotation in 
office to prevent officeholders from acquiring excessive power and being 
corrupted by it. 
</P>
<P>
It is not only individuals who aggregate power and almost inevitably abuse it; 
collections of individuals called bureaucrats also amass power and abuse it, 
albeit usually in more modest ways. However, it may well be that, in the last 
analysis, the bureaucrats are more dangerous to the general welfare than single 
abusers of power if only because they are so much harder to root out. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us back to Marxian communism. There is, obviously, no such thing 
as "historical inevitability," either communist or capitalist; there are only 
the touching, sometimes illusory dreams and ambitions of human beings who at 
their best yearn for peace and order and justice and at their worst make an 
inordinate amount of mischief (often in the process of trying to bring about 
peace, order and justice in the world). 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, many reasons why Marxian communism has failed so 
dismally, but perhaps the most basic reason is that in their pursuit of a 
utopian social order, the Marxists ignored the only historical law that cannot 
be ignored: "Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely." By 
establishing a one-party system, the Bolsheviks ensured that communism would, 
in time, be corrupted by its unchallengeable monopoly of power.

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1903, Theodore Roosevelt helped carve the Republic of Panama out of 
neighboring Colombia, to facilitate the digging of a great canal for the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, George Bush may have dug a different hole for the United States, 
launching an overkill invasion of little Panama to do away with the regime of 
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Panama's existence has been punctuated by coups, revolutions, political 
assassinations and periodic anti-American riots. But nothing in Panama's 
volatile past compares with the chaos of the last two years, the buildup of 
extraordinary hostilities -- two Presidents of the United States versus the 
detestable, cunning, resourceful Noriega. Even prior to last week's invasion, 
the Panamanian economy was virtually destroyed by U.S. sanctions and the 
Panamanian democratic impulse was quashed by Noriega oppression. 
</P>
<P>
The United States calls its operation "Just Cause," almost as if wishing will 
make it so. As a reporter, I have covered a number of U.S. military actions in 
Latin America -- the Bay of Pigs, intervention in the Dominican Republic, 
Grenada. Like those disputed operations, Just Cause suffers from failures of 
intelligence and political planning. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that the impulsions were correct, that to protect American citizens 
and to safeguard Panama Canal shipping, Noriega had to be ousted, the huge 
question now is whether the means suited the ends. The world watches an 
invasion, with civilian and military casualties. Noriega soldiers, famous for 
their bullying and brutality, have turned into looters. U.S. troops, famous for 
their training and technology, have turned into policemen, the only functioning 
law and order on the isthmus. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, days after the invasion, was still at large. The American troops, by 
contrast, may have to remain in Panama for an indefinite stay. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, U.S. action appears to have proceeded from wrong assumptions. Among 
the most wrong: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Noriega would be quickly found and captured. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Noriega followers in the Panama Defense Forces (PDF) would refuse to fight 
and would lay down arms. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the presence of military intelligence and Central Intelligence 
Agency experts in Panama, Noriega's whereabouts should have been pinned down, 
especially after all the years of plotting against him. Or, at the moment of 
launch, the White House should have been warned by U.S. intelligence that the 
general was not available, at home or office. On the first day of combat, he 
mocked his American enemies by broadcasting an appeal for resistance from a 
clandestine radio station. 
</P>
<P>
The PDF did not lay down its arms, nor did the paramilitary "Dignity 
Battalion." Washington, despite its familiarity with Panama, seems to have 
ignored the fact that Noriega's top officers and their soldiers had close ties, 
military and financial, to the general. 
</P>
<P>
Washington also seems to have ignored Panamanian pride in independence. While 
the middle class is uniformly opposed to Noriega -- especially after he 
annulled the results of last May's presidential election -- the general enjoys 
considerable support among the poor. He is a demagogue -- and an effective one, 
full of populist pretensions. The Bush Administration should have realized that 
an invasion would inevitably trigger a nationalist reaction. 
</P>
<P>
No amount of prior experience seems to have taught proper lessons about the 
quality of intelligence or the cultural gap between peoples. The U.S. 
government still cannot comprehend how Latin American societies respond to 
events of this kind, not even how these societies function. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, the CIA admitted having believed the 
entire island would rise against Fidel Castro the moment the U.S.-organized 
brigade of Cuban exiles came ashore. In reality, even Cubans who had turned 
against Castro saw the invasion as an attack on national sovereignty and 
consequently stood behind their "Maximum Leader." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1983 invasion of Grenada, the intelligence failure was underestimating 
the readiness of a tiny island army, bolstered by armed Cuban workers who were 
building a new airport. They could not repel the United States but they could 
embarrass it -- and they could cause an unacceptable number of U.S. casualties. 
</P>
<P>
In Panama, what was to be a "clean surgical strike" (in the words of a Pentagon 
briefer) turned into nasty and costly urban warfare. PDF positions in the 
capital had to be bombed Thursday night, an action not previously deemed 
necessary. An attack on Noriega headquarters in the middle of a densely 
populated working class barrio caused considerable physical damage -- and a 
number of civilian casualties. 
</P>
<P>
The paradox was plain outside Panama. Military action by the world's most 
powerful democracy was killing innocent civilians while the security forces of 
now-dethroned Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu were gunning down 
pro-democracy demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
The White House has now acknowledged that U.S. military presence in Panama is 
"open ended." Whatever happens to Noriega, restoring order in the republic will 
take weeks, probably months. The Dominican intervention of 1965 may suggest a 
precedent. The United States sent in troops to quell a local civil war. The 
rebels were quickly defeated. The fighting was minimal. Yet U.S. forces 
remained for more than three months. Panama is a bigger operation, in fact the 
largest U.S. military involvement abroad since Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Could the ends have been served by better means? Many U.S. observers think the 
President should have ordered a first-rate commando operation, not an invasion, 
if the purpose was to grab Noriega. Others have almost palpable nostalgia for 
the days of quick, quiet covert operations -- a small band to accomplish 
mammoth change. 
</P>
<P>
The means adopted certainly made no friends in the Western Hemisphere. Most 
Latin American governments denounced the invasion, including Colombia where the 
democratic government is at war with the same drug cartels that were part of 
Noriega's moonlight enterprises. The invasion may complicate efforts at peace 
settlements in Nicaragua and El Salvador. The United States will have more 
trouble holding the moral high ground in relation to the leftist Sandinistas 
and the Salvadoran Marxist guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
Was the right thing done in the wrong way? Was the wrong thing done in the 
wrong way? Just as U.S. troops remain in Panama, hostages to the invasion, U.S. 
policy remains a question mark, hostage to world perception.

REFUGEES: DESPITE ANGRY INTERNATIONAL REACTION, HONG KONG OFFICIALS PLAN TO 
CONTINUE SHIPPING VIET REFUGEES BACK TO VIETNAM.

<TEXT>
<P>
The pathetic sounds of women and children wailing and crying, being led out of 
a Vietnamese detention center by police in riot gear, greeted Hong Kong 
residents on morning newscasts less than two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier that morning, 51 terrified inmates from the Phoenix House detention 
center were bundled into caged trucks, driven under heavy guard to the airport 
and placed on a flight to Hanoi. More than half were women and children. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong decision-makers, after bickering and soul-searching, had taken the 
first and most difficult step in clearing the colony's prison-like camps of 
44,000 "boat people," and it had been carried out without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
While much of the world condemned the forced expulsion of refugees -- in 
Washington, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater called the act 
"unacceptable" -- the hard-nosed approach was applauded in the seething streets 
of Hong Kong, where people are busily preparing for Christmas and Chinese New 
Year. A recent poll in downtown Hong Kong showed that 90% support forcible 
repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
For the Vietnamese roused from their beds at 3 a.m. on Dec. 12, this wasn't the 
way a treacherous journey across the South China Sea was supposed to have 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
Like most of the other 50,000 asylum-seekers languishing in Hong Kong's 
detention centers, the next stop was expected to be Canada, the United States 
or one of the other major resettlement countries. Many had sold all their 
belongings in Vietnam to finance the trip to Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the miserable conditions of the detention centers, inmates who have 
spent several months sleeping on wooden boards in a warehouse-like hut with 
hundreds of other boat people say they would rather live in the camps 
indefinitely than return to Vietnam. Indeed, one makeshift poster seen from a 
window at Phoenix House read: "We would rather die than return to Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
The repatriation was timed to deter further arrivals when the current monsoon 
season ends in March. Only 600 boat people went home voluntarily last year; 
30,000 have sought refuge in Hong Kong this year. The 405-square-mile colony is 
home to almost half of the 90,000 boat people in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
Pirate attacks, austere conditions in the camps and the threat of being sent 
back has failed to stem the human tide of people into Hong Kong harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's appointed legislators are clearly suffering a bad case of 
compassion fatigue. Overwhelmed by the swelling ranks of boat people, members 
of the policy-making Legislative Council said they are no longer willing to 
approve more funds for the construction of new camps. Some have even suggested 
that Hong Kong abandon its asylum policy. What is clear is that 14 years after 
the end of the Vietnam War, Hong Kong is beginning to close the gates to 
Vietnamese refugees. 
</P>
<P>
After heated debate in the British House of Commons last week on repatriation, 
further expulsions are expected to continue until the camps are cleared. No 
amount of shouting or crying -- from the Vietnamese or foreign critics -- is 
expected to halt the process. For one thing, the Chinese, who resume 
sovereignty over the colony in 1997, have made clear that they want every 
Vietnamese out of Hong Kong by then. 
</P>
<P>
As part of preparations to move larger numbers, Hong Kong officials have been 
in London shopping for huge ferries that can be refitted as giant floating 
prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say that by sending people back unwillingly, British and Hong Kong 
officials unilaterally abandoned a pledge -- made at a U.N.-sponsored 
conference on Indochinese refugees in Geneva in June -- to give voluntary 
repatriation more time to work. 
</P>
<P>
There are also grave doubts about Hong Kong's system of determining whether the 
boat people are genuine refugees or merely migrants seeking a higher standard 
of living. The colony's immigration officers -- using a controversial procedure 
introduced in June, 1988 -- tend to screen out applicants without a thorough 
investigation into their motives for leaving Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"The screening of asylum-seekers is so inadequate that there is a danger that 
individuals at risk of human-rights violations could be sent back to Vietnam," 
said an Amnesty International study team. 
</P>
<P>
For ethnic Chinese, the majority population here, forcibly repatriating people 
back to a communist regime is no worse than the treatment given to the 
thousands of Chinese nationals -- many of whom have relatives in the colony -- 
who sneak into Hong Kong each year. Up to 90 illegal immigrants from China are 
unceremoniously sent back each day. Even illegal immigrant mothers caught 
visiting their husbands and children living in colony are immediately 
repatriated. 
</P>
<P>
What worries refugee officials is that other Southeast Asian countries will 
follow Hong Kong's lead and begin sending boat people back to Vietnam -- or 
worse, turning boatloads of Vietnamese back to sea. In recent months, Thailand, 
Malaysia and Taiwan have forcibly towed boat people from their shores, exposing 
them to the danger of pirate attacks and drowning. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to repatriate such a small group was clearly a trial balloon 
designed to test international reaction and ultimately the willingness of the 
Vietnam government to honor its promise of not punishing returnees. As part of 
a secret agreement with Vietnam, Britain says it has secured rights to monitor 
the treatment of those sent back. 
</P>
<P>
Although the government of Vietnam has assured Britain it will not punish 
anyone, Vietnamese law stipulates that a person who leaves the country without 
permission commits a criminal offense. Quyen Vuong, 24, who lived in Orange 
County for a time after she fled Vietnam in 1981 with her family, has spent 
long hours helping boat people amid the corrugated tin and barbed wire of Hong 
Kong's camps. Now a student in Hong Kong, she says it is unreasonable to assume 
that the returnees will not be subjected to harsh treatment back home. "The 
local authorities can make their life unbearable. The stigma for those who left 
will stay with them forever."

FROM HIM, THE ESSENTIAL SPARK; 
</P>
<P>
POPE: IT WAS JOHN PAUL II WHO PROVIDED THE SPIRITUAL WILL FOR EASTERN EUROPE'S 
TRANSFORMATION. HE MADE THE CATHOLIC FAITH STAND FOR SOMETHING.

<P>
The man who did more than any other to shape the 1980s, Pope John Paul II, is 
also the undersung hero of the revolutions of 1989. The first Pope to have 
endured years living under communism, he has lived to see it humbled. 
</P>
<P>
It was touching to see the general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party come 
to this Pope to pay him homage. Many have not forgotten that in 1981, John Paul 
lay near death from the bullets of a would-be assassin. Or that he later 
visited the convicted assassin in his cell to express a word of comfort and 
forgiveness. And that he never publicly accused those who had planned his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
What was Pope John Paul II thinking, then, as he accepted the highly dramatic 
visit of Mikhail S. Gorbachev? I wonder if he asked himself, "How many 
divisions does Gorbachev have? And for how long?" 
</P>
<P>
Not many months ago, John Paul urgently wanted to visit the Ukraine and perhaps 
also Catholic Lithuania, which has suffered fierce oppression. In 1988, had he 
been been permitted, he would happily have celebrated 1,000 years of the 
preaching of the Christian Gospel in Kiev. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in the presence of the Soviet leader, the Pope was in a position to refuse 
to visit the Ukraine until full religious liberty has been restored there and 
elsewhere in the Soviet Union. He listened intently as Gorbachev praised the 
indispensable role of religion in revitalizing the moribund communist system. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope has spoken publicly, incessantly and in every part of the world about 
the leitmotif of his papacy: the primacy of the human spirit. In 1989, a world 
of skeptics saw that primacy in the face of barbed wire, walls and guns. 
</P>
<P>
When many others had seemed to give up hope during the days of martial law in 
Poland in 1981, John Paul II began planning earnestly to visit his homeland as 
Pope. With his encouragement, in eight short years the leaders of Poland's 
Solidarity rose from prisons and detention camps to Parliament. This 
achievement would not have been conceivable without the steady presence of the 
Polish Pope, outside the walls of the Iron Curtain, holding the attention of 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
I do not mean to underestimate the role played by President Reagan in putting 
the struggle against communism into spiritual and moral terms, in rallying the 
malaise-ridden spirit of the West and in demonstrating to the Soviets two 
important realities: that Marxism would soon be swept into "the dustbin of 
history," and that the West would begin to turn back the previously unchecked 
advance of Marxist power around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Nor do I wish to underestimate the role of Mikhail Gorbachev, who had the 
intelligence and courage to face these facts and who took the indispensable 
steps to save what could be saved of communism. Reagan applied the pressing 
weight of these realities from outside, and Gorbachev recognized them from 
within. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the crucial missing element, which neither of these men could 
generate alone, was the spiritual will of the peoples of Eastern Europe to 
claim their inalienable rights and to exert their irresistible "people power." 
Emboldened by the decade-long example of the Pope's beloved Solidarity (led by 
an electrician from Gdansk), one by one the peoples of Eastern Europe awakened 
to the inner power that John Paul II had shown was theirs. They withheld their 
consent to be governed, and the dreadful juggernaut of communism crumbled at 
its core. 
</P>
<P>
In John Paul II, the Catholic faith came to stand for something vital, 
challenging, bracing. For, in addition to "the primacy of the spiritual," he 
articulated three other compelling messages. Each of these has roots in the 
Gospel, but each also has political force. 
</P>
<P>
The first of these messages was that Europe is a tree with two main branches, 
East and West. Its roots are one. Despite appearances, the wall dividing Europe 
represented an illusion and was doomed. 
</P>
<P>
His second message was that the first of all human rights is the right to 
religious liberty. For each human being is made in the image of God. Each is 
free to reflect and to choose. Each is responsible. In this responsibility lies 
human dignity. 
</P>
<P>
His third message was that the only political system that seems to allow this 
inherent liberty to express itself in time and space is democracy. It is not 
enough to have spiritual liberty; people must be free to express themselves 
publicly in worldly structures and systems. Among such systems, democracy is 
assuredly flawed, like all things human. Yet no other system protects human 
rights as well. Democracy means not majority rule alone, but also the 
protection of human rights, including the rights of the unborn. The social 
revolution, the Pope thinks, is moral -- or else it is incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
The name of Pope John Paul II will live forever as one of the 10 greatest 
popesof history. His legend will grow. Seldom has a Pope been so blessed as to 
see so many of the seeds he sowed take such solidroot and ripen in so full a 
harvest within his own lifetime. He has seen great changes occur in Eastern 
Europe, in the Philippines, in Chile, in Africa and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Pope John Paul II has made many enemies in the brief 11 years since his 
accession. Let them take warning. What this man sows, he reaps. What he teaches 
takes root. Not through his power, of course, but that of the Word he obeys. 
</P>
<P>
A thousand years from now, the Vatican meeting between John Paul II and Mikhail 
Gorbachev is likely to be bearing fruit in the Ukraine, Lithuania and elsewhere 
in the Eastern branch of Christianity. A thousand years, not a year or even a 
decade, is the proper time span for measuring the achievement of a pope. In 
many centuries, the world has not seen his like. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the new film "Henry V," Henry's victorious troops sing a prayer 
of thanksgiving that fits this occasion perfectly: 
</P>
<P>
 Non nobis, Domine, sed Nomine Tuo, da Gloriam. 
</P>
<P>
"Not to us, Lord, but to Thy Name, the glory." 
</P>
<P>
What he set out to do in 1978 has come to pass beyond Pope John Paul II's 
dreams. The world has changed dramatically. One day, parents will tell their 
children of him.

OLD-FASHIONED POLITICS TO THE COUNTY'S RESCUE; 
</P>
<P>
REDISTRICTING: SUPERVISORS ARE SAID TO AGREE ON EXPANDING BOARD TO SEVEN, 
THEREBY KEEPING CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY AND ENSURING A LATINO MEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Barring a last-minute glitch, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors will 
place a measure on the June ballot that would expand the board from five to 
seven members, sources say. The dramatic turnaround comes after efforts to 
settle a federal lawsuit, aimed at giving Latinos a better chance of electing 
one of their own, collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say that at its Jan. 2 meeting the board will vote unanimously to 
enlarge its membership. (A 1976 ballot measure to expand the board was soundly 
defeated.) Jan. 2 is the day the suit is scheduled to go to trial in Los 
Angeles. The Justice Department, joined by the Mexican American Legal Defense 
and Educational Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union, contends that the 
supervisors have systematically diluted Latino political power in their 
redistricting, a violation of the federal Voting Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
Although details of the supervisors' proposed redistricting are still closely 
guarded, the board's five incumbents would keep most of their safe districts. 
The proposed sixth district would include East Los Angeles, Montebello and Pico 
Rivera and would be at least 70% Latino. The new seventh seat would represent a 
slice of the San Fernando Valley, with the political advantage going to a 
conservative. Thus, conservatives probably would retain their majority on the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, only liberal Supervisors Kenneth Hahn, who has championed the idea 
for 16 years, and Ed Edelman favored an enlarged board. Conservatives Pete 
Schabarum and Mike Antonovich have consistently voted to challenge the Justice 
Department in court rather than expandthe board. Deane Dana, the third 
conservative supervisor and author of an unsuccessful pre-trial compromise, 
also opposed adding board members. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, however, old-fashioned political pragmatism seems to have kept the 
conservatives off the courthouse steps. Under the expansion plan, Hahn, Dana 
and Antonovitch would be on the 1992 ballot, along with the candidates for the 
two new seats. Edelman and Schabarum face the voters next June. 
</P>
<P>
A Dana-orchestrated plan that was approved by the board would have forced 
Schabarum to run in a new, predominantly Latino district. The ACLU and MALDEF 
rejected the proposal on the ground that only 35% of the registered voters in 
the new district would have been Latino. When they counterproposed with new 
district lines, the supervisors rebuffed them. 
</P>
<P>
At week's end, sources said that Antonovich and Los Angeles City Councilman 
Richard Alatorre, who is expected to seek a seat on an expanded board, were 
discussing lines for the new Latino district. Meanwhile, Scharbarum was 
thoroughly enjoying his reprieve from certain political death. 
</P>
<P>
The odds are strong that Sen. Alan Cranston, 75 and tarnished, by the Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan scandal, will face a Democratic primary challenger in 1992. 
Although potential rivals are reluctant to discuss their intentions publicly, 
sources familiar with the thinking of Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), 48, 
say the six-term congressman will run. Last year, Matsui, an attorney, decided 
against seeking the nomination to challenge Sen. Pete Wilson. He also briefly 
flirted with idea of being the state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
Matsui's intentions will become clearer, the sources said, early in the new 
year, when he begins raising funds for his reelection. The more statewide 
visibility Matsui seeks, they said, the more reason Cranston has to be 
concerned. Traditionally scoring at or near the top of House colleagues in 
terms of winning percentages, Matsui already has $800,000 in the bank. Federal 
rules allow House members to transfer funds to a Senate race.

DRUGS: LIKE SOME SCI-FI POTBOILER, THE CRUSADE SEEMS TO BE A SEARCH FOR A 
CONVENIENT ENEMY IN THE WAKE OF A DIMINISHED COMMUNIST THREAT.

<P>
After living in Southeast Asia for several years, I have recently returned to a 
nation at war. Every night the television networks are filled with sober images 
of battle-dressed correspondents venturing into the lair of the enemy. 
President Bush has told the nation that it must mobilize its resources to meet 
the threat. Even Nancy Reagan, accompanied by Los Angeles police, has visited 
the front lines. 
</P>
<P>
From the look and sound of things, the war on drugs, complete with evil 
Colombian cocaine suppliers and menacing black crack dealers, is the equivalent 
of a global conflict. And it's a great one for consensus, too, because, as with 
World War II, the Bush Administration and the news media seem to have found in 
drugs an issue that brooks no dissent. The only question is how much to spend 
and where to fight. 
</P>
<P>
But having seen real war and real crisis, I am having a little trouble with 
this one. Beginning with the cover-up during the Reagan Administration of the 
relationship with Panamanian leader and drug lord Manuel A. Noriega and ending 
with the disclosure that President Bush's handlers had cynically arranged a 
drug buy across from the White House for a televised speech, the tone of the 
campaign is overblown hype. Like some grainy 1950s science-fiction potboiler, 
the real purpose seems to be the search for an evil. It's them -- outsiders, 
non-Americans and nonwhite Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The drug war is Washington's crusade to find an enemy, an excuse. We are making 
friends with the Russians and have lost the effort to overthrow the Sandinistas 
in Nicaragua. We need a convenient enemy. But if we find that enemy in our own 
cities, in the despair of a long-neglected underclass, America risks going to 
war with itself. 
</P>
<P>
I listen to rap music for clues to the drug war. Listen to the groups Public 
Enemy or NWA, rappers whose rage explodes right onto the surface, youngsters 
who say they don't take drugs but sell them to affluent customers in exchange 
for access to the good life. Then listen to Bush. These people are barely 
inhabiting the same planet. 
</P>
<P>
Americans take drugs in massive amounts -- alcohol, crack, cocaine, speed, 
heroin, marijuana, pills to lose weight, pills to get smooth. Just add that 
insatiable demand to a poor, urban population that has had most government 
programs and opportunities curtailed or eliminated since the Reagan 
Administration, and the roots of the current "war" are obvious. 
</P>
<P>
We should be honest with ourselves and realize that the answer to the crisis 
presented by the illegal drug industry is not going to be found in more prisons 
and larger police budgets. If only Americans could look at themselves and the 
consequences of past failures, we might find that instead of a drug war, we 
need a period of reconstruction and recovery from the damage already wrought by 
a social war of neglect that has left the nation dismembered and confused, 
divided more than ever by a great gulf of class, race and opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
If we believe the typical profile of the affluent drug customer, he or she 
seems to be the kind of younger person who has benefited most from the 
pro-business climate of the last several years: the high-achieving, fast-track, 
get-it-quick success story. What a strange symmetry that the suppliers, the 
street dealers in the cities, seem to be the exact opposite: those left behind 
and locked outside the brave world of success at any cost. 
</P>
<P>
As long as that profile continues, the symbiosis between the user and the 
supplier will likely continue. We won't get anywhere standing in the ring and 
screaming for the drug lords to come out and fight mano a mano. 
</P>
<P>
So, yes, I have come home to a nation at war. But I would hope that Americans 
can resurrect the wisdom of Walt Kelly's Pogo: "We have met the enemy, and he 
is us."

TAXES: THE MOST UNFAIR OF THEM ALL, FICA, RISES AGAIN, NATURALLY HITTING 
WORKERS THE HARDEST. 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Happy New Year and read my lips: As of Jan. 1, your taxes go up. For the 15th 
time in 27 years, the new year will bring an increase in the FICA payroll tax, 
which supposedly finances Social Security and Medicare. This time the tax rate 
will rise from 7.51% to 7.65%. Including the employer's matching share, the 
FICA tax rate of 15.3% will be higher than the basic income-tax rate of 15%. 
</P>
<P>
The top wage on which FICA is collected also will go up, from $48,000 to 
$51,300. So the maximum annual FICA payment will rise from $3604.80 to $3924.45 
-- $7848.90, including the employer's share. That's almost a 9% hike. 
</P>
<P>
While President Bush keeps saying, "no new taxes," the FICA adjustment amounts 
to a quiet tax increase of almost $15 billion. Since 1978, FICA tax rates have 
risen by 30%. Most of this increase is the result of a "reform" signed with a 
flourish by Mr. Tax-Cut himself, President Ronald Reagan, in 1983. In fiscal 
1990, FICA is projected to bring in $389 billion -- four-fifths as much as the 
individual income tax. For most taxpayers, FICA takes more money than the 
income tax. 
</P>
<P>
It would be hard to design a tax more unfair than FICA. Unlike the income tax, 
it has only one rate and no exemptions. As a result, a minimum-wage worker pays 
the same share of income as someone making $50,000 a year. Someone making 
$60,000 actually pays a smaller share, because the tax stops at $51,300. And 
someone whose income is from dividends, interest and capital gains pays 
nothing, since the tax applies only to wages. 
</P>
<P>
The FICA tax looks no better from the supply side. It is a more direct 
disincentive to enterprise and employment than the much-abused capital-gains 
tax. The entrepreneur who is starting a company may have to pay a capital-gains 
tax, some day, if the company prospers and she sells her shares. But she must 
pay FICA on her payroll from day one, whether she prospers or not. The income 
tax doesn't prevent the creation of entry-level jobs, because low-wage workers 
pay no income tax. But everyone pays FICA. A job must be worth 15% more to an 
employer than it is to an employee before anyone gets hired. 
</P>
<P>
In January, President Bush will try again for a capital-gains tax cut. What 
better way to counter it than to propose a "supply-side tax cut for working 
people": a large slice in the FICA levy. A 40% cutin the worker's share of 
FICA, for example, would be worth $765 to a person earning $25,000 a year -- 
$1530 to a working couple making $25,000 each. This would go down well compared 
with Bush's capital-gains cut, which would give an average saving of $25,000 a 
year to people making more than $200,000 a year and nothing to most Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The cost? About $75 billion in lost revenues. As it happens, that is the size 
of the projected Social Security surplus for 1991: the amount by which revenues 
will exceed expenses. This surplus is supposed to be going into a kitty to 
finance the retirement of the baby boomers in the next century. But the kitty 
is a myth. The money is being used to finance today's government expenses. Next 
year's Gramm-Rudman deficit target, for example, is $64 billion. Even if we hit 
it, the real deficit -- not counting that $75 billion FICA surplus -- will be 
more than double. 
</P>
<P>
There is no way society as a whole can save money for its future retirement. 
The resources retirees consume in the year 2025 will have to be produced in the 
year 2025 or thereabouts. All we can do is take steps now to increase our 
future productive capacity. That way, retirees' claims on 2025's resources 
needn't reduce the claims of then-current workers. If the Social Security 
surplus was increasing productive investment -- even indirectly, by reducing 
the government's demand for credit -- it would be achieving that purpose. But 
it clearly isn't. It's enabling the government to avoid fiscal reality. 
</P>
<P>
When it is time to draw down the kitty, taxes will have to be raised to pay off 
the IOUs it contains. (Or the promise to retirees will have to be broken.) The 
situation will be exactly the same as if the kitty didn't exist and taxes had 
to be raised to pay retirement benefits directly. With this difference: For a 
generation, the government will have been financed in large part by a 
regressive tax. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, if you cut FICA taxes by $75 billion, you still need to replace the 
money, or you will only have made matters even worse. It's tempting to say the 
magic words, "peace dividend." But that's already been spent several times over 
on the nation's Op-Ed pages. An across-the-board 10% income-tax surcharge would 
almost pay the bill, and would leave 19 of 20 families better off (which shows 
you how unfair the FICA tax is). Or we can start hitting the fiscal wish list. 
Every revenue buff's got one. Mine is available on request. 
</P>
<P>
Responsible people may be thinking it wouldn't be a bad idea to raise some new 
revenue without squandering the money on a tax cut. But Ronald Reagan and 
George Bush have relieved the Democrats of any obligation to be responsible in 
fiscal matters. The past decade has not been one of tax cuts. It has been one 
of replacing taxes on high incomes and capital with taxes on low-income 
workers. Rectifying the abuse without actually increasing the deficit is as 
responsible as anyone reasonably needs to be.

POLITICS OF ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently there has been a rash of abandoned babies in the Southland, who have 
been left in trash bins or on doorsteps. Instead of being chastised, women who 
do this should be treated with empathy and compassion, as they are often young 
girls who are scared, desperate and without any family support. How can we 
bring hundreds of thousands of additional children into the world, which is 
what anti-abortionists advocate, when we can't even properly care for those we 
already have?

DISCRIMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Please teach us that discrimination is unacceptable. . . ." An honest and 
meaningful plea from Jordan Marsh, the president of the University of 
Wisconsin's senior class ("Wisconsin University Faculty Votes to Expel ROTC 
Program," Part A, Dec. 5). Marsh's plea reflects the prayers of all of us who 
demand the end of bigotry and of the bashing of our lesbian and gay children. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Wisconsin faculty added its petition to that of the students 
and urged that the Board of Regents expel the ROTC, thus translating into 
action the widespread feeling on campus that our military's "longstanding ban 
on gay and lesbian participation in the ROTC and other programs . . . " is 
unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh's plea to his teachers underscores a truth that must be confronted by all 
of us who are responsible for our children's well-being. If we expect them to 
experience the end of persecution, the end of a second class-citizenry, the end 
of people-to-people violence, we must teach "to bigotry, no sanction." We must 
teach our children that differences are interesting, not inciting; that 
disagreements should motivate discussion, not discrimination; that 
misunderstandings must be clarified, not cemented into our culture.

REPATRIATION OF BOAT PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is extremely regrettable that the government of Hong Kong decided to force 
the repatriation of Vietnamese refugees. It is more shameful of the free world 
to react lightly on this matter. But we cannot blame the people of Hong Kong 
for being heartless because they have done more than their share of sheltering 
the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
While countries around the world are trying to come up with a solution and 
accusing each other at the same time for not doing enough, they have overlooked 
the main causes of the "boat people" problem. The first cause is the oppressive 
and deceitful policies of the Viet Cong government. This unpopular regime is 
the root of the "boat people" tragedy. To end this tragedy is to solve the Viet 
Cong problem once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
The "ex-refugees" themselves are the second cause. Former Vietnamese citizens 
are returning to visit Vietnam in increasing numbers in spite of laws banning 
travels by the government of the nations where they now reside. The U.S. 
government, in particular, has looked the other way and allowed these illegal 
travels to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
Having returned to Vietnam and not having been persecuted by the Viet Cong 
regime, these selfish, law-breaking tourists have falsely shown to the free 
world and especially Vietnam's neighboring nations that there is no political 
persecution in Vietnam. They have forgotten that the only reason the Viet Cong 
let them come back is money. Money not for solving the economic crisis caused 
by the regime's ignorance and economic mismanagement, but for clinging to 
fading powers. 
</P>
<P>
Sooner or later this unjust regime will be overthrown and replaced by a true 
democratic government.

CHILDREN: THE MEANS EXIST TO STOP NEEDLESS DEATHS FROM HUNGER AND DISEASE IN

By Bruce Child; Tony Hall, RRYMAN, ; Takujiro Hamada, Dr. Uwe Holtz, Jim

<P>
If the planet could look under its own tree Christmas morning to find gifts of 
human progress, one package -- unimaginable several years ago -- would contain 
the political achievements that are thawing the Cold War. If the wrapping paper 
had newspaper headlines printed on it, those headlines might read: "Berlin Wall 
Down" or "Non-Communist Government in Poland." 
</P>
<P>
Another package -- perhaps at the top of the planet's wish list -- would hold a 
reprieve for our suffering environment. The headlines on the wrapping paper 
might announce, "Agreement on Global Warming" or "Recycling on the Increase." 
</P>
<P>
But a third package would lie hidden in the back, unlikely to be opened or even 
seen. This package could provide a remedy for another calamity -- the needless 
deaths of 40,000 Third World children each day from hunger and poverty. It's 
wrapping paper would be blank, because there have been no headlines. But if 
this gift came with an instruction booklet, it would certainly be the United 
Nations Children's Fund's 1990 report, "the State of the World's Children." 
</P>
<P>
The report tells us that even with the current rate of progress, 100 million 
children will die during the 1990s from illness and malnutrition. These deaths 
won't come from floods or famine. They won't be covered by television; an 
outraged public will not demand action. 
</P>
<P>
The world will hardly notice as young lives are lost to diseases that were once 
killers in developed countries. As the report states, "They will die in the 
sunken-eyed coma of dehydration, or in the gasping extremities of pneumonia, or 
in the iron grip of tetanus, or in the fever of measles, or on the rack of 
whooping cough." Most important, the report reveals that these deaths are 
needless and could be prevented at low cost. 
</P>
<P>
UNICEF has proposed a World Summit for Children next year, at which heads of 
state would make this situation the world's highest priority. The UNICEF report 
outlines several major opportunities to protect the lives and normal growth of 
children: 
</P>
<P>
Universal immunization. The increase in immunizations this decade saves about 2 
million lives each year from measles, tetanus, whooping cough and other deadly 
diseases, yet 3 million youngsters continue to die yearly because about 
one-third of the world's children haven't been vaccinated. The vaccines cost 
less than $1.50 per child. 
</P>
<P>
Oral rehydration therapy. A 10-cent packet of oral rehydration salts saves 
about 1 million lives each year, but only one out of three families in the 
Third World uses the solution. 
</P>
<P>
Acute respiratory infections. Hundreds of thousands of children could be saved 
each year if community-health workers were trained to administer simple 
antibiotics, which cost about $1 per course. 
</P>
<P>
Breast feeding. Bottle-fed infants contract many more illnesses and are as much 
as 25 times more likely to die in childhood than infants who are breast-fed 
exclusively for the first six months of life. 
</P>
<P>
Making today's low-cost solutions available to the world's children would cost 
about $2.5 billion a year. That's what the Soviets spend on vodka each month, 
or American companies spend on cigarette advertising each year. It's also 10% 
of the European Community's annual agricultural subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
Half of the developing nations' annual expenditures are allocated for military 
spending and debt servicing. The developed world devotes more than six times 
this much -- about $855 billion -- to military spending. UNICEF asserts that 
the industrialized world has a major role to play in helping the developing 
world by "opening up the debt trap, renewing investment, liberalizing trade, 
compensating for steep falls in commodity prices and increasing the level of 
aid . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, UNICEF's report on the state of the world's children said that 
we have the knowledge, techniques and organizational capacity to save these 
millions of young lives and concluded: 
</P>
<P>
"We are therefore confronted with a stark question: Do we have the will? 
</P>
<P>
"And of those who would argue that it is not a matter of will but of resources, 
it must now be asked -- how low does the cost have to fall before the will is 
found? We are now talking about a particular opportunity to save the lives of 
(millions of) young children a year. . . . If the will to accept that challenge 
is missing, then perhaps it will never be there. For in all realism, it is 
unlikely that there will ever again be such an opportunity to do so much for so 
many, and for so little." 
</P>
<P>
The children are still dying to know if we have the will.

NIGHT MOVES: FOR STEPPIN' OUT, SWING'S THE THING; 
</P>
<P>
HY'S IN CULVER CITY DRAWS CROWDS WITH EVENINGS DEVOTED TO THE SWIRLING, 
SENSUOUS DANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 9:30 p.m. on a recent Wednesday evening in the two-tiered lounge of Hy's 
Restaurant in Century City, Arthur Black and Riquette Hofstein had the dance 
floor -- beneath a crescent-shaped bar area -- all to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The couple executed steps from such popular dances as the New York hustle and 
the East Coast swing (a contemporary version of the jitterbug). They danced to 
"Call the Plumber," a raunchy blues number by the late singer Big Joe Turner, 
programmed by Diane De Marco, a former singer who has been a club DJ since 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't long before the floor was filled with dancers and the air 
crackled with excitement. Couples such as Romeo Mendoza and Valerie Nash and 
Donna Hyatt and 
</P>
<P>
Eric Hernandez whirled and twirled across the floor to disco-based tunes such 
as Gregory Abbott's "This Girl Really Wants to Dance With Me." 
</P>
<P>
Dancer Leba Shana, wearing a red flowing dress with matching red shoes and 
stockings, drew a spontaneous ovation from the crowd of about 150 when she 
climaxed a New York hustle routine with an eye-boggling, full-circle spin, led 
by one of her partners, Byron Ziman. Ziman, and Mendoza a few moments before, 
danced with Shana to the thumping beat of Donna Summer's "This Time I Know It's 
for Real." 
</P>
<P>
It was just a typical Wednesday at Hy's, just another Swing Night party thrown 
by Sandra Giles, who has been bringing her show to Hy's for about two years. 
The former actress and part-time real estate agent has coordinated dance events 
at various Westside nightclubs for about a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Giles got started as a hostess of dance evenings while she was a member of 
private club in Beverly Hills that was experiencing a decline in night-time 
business. "I offered to bring in some of my friends who were good dancers to 
put on a show and spruce up things, and people loved it so they asked me to 
organize it on a regular basis," Giles said. 
</P>
<P>
For the last five years, Giles -- who was in constant motion during the 
evening, buzzing from table to table, making sure her guests were enjoying 
themselves -- has been assisted by Shana, a professional dancer who produces 
the showcase portion of the Swing Nights, which is mainly for swing, hustle and 
salsa dancers. 
</P>
<P>
"I call the dancers and invite them. I have a huge list to draw from, but I 
never know who will be there, so it's never preplanned," Shana said. "I do tell 
people if they want to dance, I like them there by 10:30 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
If Shana does coordinate the order of appearances, she keeps her hands off the 
choreography. "The dancers take responsibility for their own routines," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Though many of the participants in the showcase on this Wednesday were 
professionals, Shana stressed that these evenings, including the showcase, are 
not for pros only. "I always welcome new dancers," she said. "If I go somewhere 
and see good dancers, I invite them to dance in the showcase. But I'd say most 
of the dancers are there just for the love of dancing, not to be in the 
showcase. Dancing keeps you young." 
</P>
<P>
Black, who has been dancing since he was a preteen, agreed. "It's a great 
workout for the cardiovascular system," he said. "You don't have to go for a 
walk, you don't have to run, and dancing is a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
It's also a relatively risk-free way to meet people, said Nancy Hope, an 
actress and model from Beverly Hills who, with her partner, Pat Kinney, opened 
the evening's showcase with a snazzy swing routine. "There are not that many 
places where you can feel great being a woman by yourself. Here, you can, 
because it's not a pickup joint." 
</P>
<P>
On the next night, a Thursday, a much smaller crowd was in the lounge, 
listening to pianist Larry Nash's trio -- with bassist Stan Gilbert and drummer 
Donald Dean -- work its way through a couple of blues-tinged numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Even with only a smattering of listeners, when singer Dee Dee McNeil, a 20-year 
veteran who has worked most of Los Angeles' top jazz rooms, got up to sing, she 
did it with gusto. 
</P>
<P>
After inviting audience members up to the dance floor, McNeil kicked off the 
seasonal standard, "Winter Wonderland." As she sang, she danced in place and 
snapped her fingers in time to Dean's popping backbeat. Her other tunes, from 
the ballad "Old Folks" to Charles Brown's classic, "Merry Christmas, Baby," 
were rendered with the same spirit and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
During a break, McNeil, who has written tunes for Nancy Wilson, Diana Ross and 
the Supremes and the Four Tops, said that as far as positive responses go, she 
gets as good as she gives. 
</P>
<P>
"To bring people a good feeling, whether it's a slow night or a packed house, 
is wonderful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
McNeil, who works Hy's Thursday through Saturday from 9:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. 
until the end of this month (including New Year's Eve), said that while she 
offers danceable pop tunes, she also sings blues and jazz numbers. The latter 
are her favorites. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to McNeil, live music is provided by pianist David Swanson, who 
works in the lounge Monday through Saturday from 5:30 to 8:30 p.m., and David 
White, who works Tuesdays from 9:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. through December. There 
is no cover charge for entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Hy's -- which was formerly the Princess Restaurant until purchased by current 
owner Rod Gardiner in 1985 -- sports two large dining rooms, where customers 
can choose from a variety of steaks -- all cut from prime, Midwestern, dry-aged 
beef -- fresh fish, veal, seafood and pasta. Dinner for two, without wine, is 
$40 to $60. 
</P>
<P>
 Hy's, 10131 Constellation Blvd., Century City. Lunch, Monday through Friday, 
11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; dinner, Monday through Saturday, 6 to 11 p.m. The 
lounge is open until 1:30 a.m. Closed Sundays. (213) 553-6000.

THE BRAVE LITTLE LE GOURMAND ATTEMPTS TO IMPORT A BIT OF THE CONTINENT, BUT 
ALAS, THE FOOD IS MISSING A JE NE SAIS QUOI 
</P>

<P>
The woman eating French food is wearing a beret, an actual beret, and the sort 
of broad-striped shirt that was fashionable in Paris a couple of decades back. 
She's a vision from the '50s or early '60s, when not many Americans had been to 
Europe and people with this sort of yearning for la belle France sometimes 
dressed a la francaise at restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
These days, of course, France is much closer. In fact, it wouldn't be hard to 
find genuine French people within two miles of here at this very moment 
shopping for expensive blue jeans up on Rodeo Drive. But Beverly Hills is 
Beverly Hills, and two miles can be all the distance in the world. Down here, a 
couple of blocks from the Santa Monica Freeway, Le Gourmand Cafe is all the 
France there is. 
</P>
<P>
Le Gourmand has all the marks of a brave little outpost, with the accent on the 
little: six tables in the tiny dining room, plus one in back of the kitchen. 
The decor is a hodgepodge of handmade baskets, folk art dishware, garlic braids 
and even a Chianti bottle or two (a little hard to explain on strictly French 
grounds). The room is upgraded from time to time, negligible paintings, for 
instance, being replaced by sleek black and white photos of Paris streets. 
</P>
<P>
An outpost. A sign on the wall announces that Le Gourmand will serve a 
breakfast or dinner for two in your home. It even offers sidewalk dining, for 
anyone who cares -- or dares -- to dine romantically in the roaring traffic of 
La Cienega. Two little tables go out on the sidewalk every day, so some people 
must. 
</P>
<P>
The earnest young chef, who sometimes waits his own tables, is clearly doing 
what he can, but there are certain limitations when you're an outpost. The wine 
list is short; the menu, which is going through minor alterations all the time, 
is very cautious. 
</P>
<P>
But the coffee is good and the bread very decent for this neck of the woods. A 
simple salad in thick tarragon sauce is garnished with an artichoke leaf topped 
with a rosette carved out of a piece of carrot. The appetizers are honest, if 
completely without surprises. There's a smooth and flavorful duck liver pate, 
served with old-fashioned toast points and a bit of cucumber salad. 
</P>
<P>
The onion soup must have a splash of wine in the broth; the onions are well and 
truly done, and the cheese tastes like a particularly nutty Gruyere. The 
veloute soup, a puree of vegetables, is largely broccoli, and better than it 
sounds. The lobster bisque, though it has a pure lobster aroma, is a little 
less than it sounds, like lobster-flavored milk. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps there's a subtle war against calories behind the lobster bisque, 
because the veal blanquette (veal stewed in white sauce, possibly with a bit of 
orange peel in it) is not as rich as veal blanquette usually is -- when you 
find veal blanquette on a menu at all. 
</P>
<P>
It's Le Gourmand's best seller, though, a soothing sort of dish served on rice. 
Sometimes there's a veal Marengo special, much like the veal blanquette but a 
little more flavorful, with tomato and both black and green olives. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, the entrees are the most cautious part of the menu. The best is the 
entrecote with mustard sauce, a small European-style steak and not particularly 
tender, but it has a pleasant sauce. It's like a mild, thin bearnaise sauce, 
with a bit of mustard flavor cut by a bit of tomato paste. 
</P>
<P>
The duck with orange sauce, though, is much too cautious. It comes in a dim 
orange-flavored cream sauce, not terribly sweet but not at all distinctive, and 
the lack of sweetness is no great virtue when there's a canned peach on the 
plate. The shrimp with garlic is more or less the familiar scampi served on 
rice. 
</P>
<P>
The desserts are fairly elemental, though sometimes there's a stylish 
paper-thin apple tartlette made with paper-thin apple slices. You can always 
get a nice pair of pears poached in red wine, flavored with cinnamon. The creme 
brulee, though, has a feeble excuse for a sugar-crust layer -- its spotty brown 
surface looks like a Visitor's scalp in "Alien Nation." The peach custard pie 
is extremely eggy in flavor, topped with peach slices. In fact, Le Gourmand has 
a sort of peach motif. They give you a sip of peach schnapps with dessert. 
</P>
<P>
And one last dessert seems to be part of the war on calories. The chocolate 
mousse might have no butterfat at all -- foamy and frothy and tasting of cocoa. 
The lady in the beret likes it, and in a way I do too, but not because I think 
it's French: it's like a rather dense milkshake. 
</P>
<P>
Recommended dishes: duck pate, $3.50; veal blanquette, $9.95; entrecote with 
mustard sauce, $11.95; poached pear, $2.75. 
</P>

CREDITING FRIENDSHIP IN 'SOPHIE AND WILLA'; 
</P>
<P>
A 'UNIQUE SOLUTION' IS WROUGHT BY TWO PLAYWRIGHTS' ABILITY TO SHARE ONE STORY 
</P>

<P>
Michael Kassin's friends thought he was crazy to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Thom Ackerman Maslow thought it made perfect sense, and still does. 
</P>
<P>
Katharine Sloan was glad that it happened, but isn't quite sure what to make of 
it all now. 
</P>
<P>
What playwright Kassin did to make his writer friends scratch their heads might 
sound, on paper, to be a case of the dramatist's cardinal sin. But Kassin 
assures anyone who will listen that it's nothing as horrible as that. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Kassin's attempt at giving life to his comedy, "Sophie and 
Willa," ranks as one of the most unusual theater-making strategies in some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
After eight years of failing to see his play receive a full production, Kassin 
allowed producer Maslow to hand over the script to Sloan for a rewrite. That 
was two years ago. Last weekend, "Sophie and Willa" opened at the Tiffany 
Theatre for a run through Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany patrons will find the following credit in the show's program: "A comedy 
by Katharine R. Sloan based on the original play by Michael Kassin." According 
to David LeVine, president of the Dramatists Guild, which represents the legal 
and artistic interests of member playwrights in the United States, the form of 
dual credit is fairly unheard of. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of anything else quite like it," LeVine said. "This sounds like 
a set of unique concerns which this solution seems to address. It's certainly a 
unique solution." 
</P>
<P>
It is standard Hollywood practice for a movie or TV writer's script to be taken 
away and given to another writer if the producer -- or whoever owns the 
material -- wishes. In the theater, the playwright is author and owner; 
legally, a word may not be changed without the playwright's consent. 
</P>
<P>
Combine this citadel-like realm of authorship with the fact that, while Kassin 
is a veteran playwright, Sloan is a veteran of TV sitcoms, and you have the 
basis for writers' war. 
</P>
<P>
But, "Michael was extremely patient from the beginning to the end of 
rewriting," said Sloan, who is director of features and comedy development for 
the Disney Channel. "In fact," she added, "he was amazing." 
</P>
<P>
"I've waited this long to see the play up on a stage," Kassin said by phone 
from New York. "I can wait for script improvements. Besides, though the words 
have been changed, the story, the dramatic arc and the main characters are 
pretty much the same. That's no mean feat, so I give Kathy a lot of credit." 
</P>
<P>
Call it adapting to circumstances -- much like the two hardy New York women, 
Sophie Coppleman and Willa Jackson, at the heart of the comedy. Willa, a black 
woman, pregnant at the age of 40 and abandoned by her boyfriend, seems like a 
ship lost at sea until Sophie, an elderly and feisty Jewish lady, gives her 
safe harbor. Against all odds, they become friends. 
</P>
<P>
Kassin gave "Sophie and Willa" its first public hearing in 1979 at Baltimore's 
Center Stage. Actress Estelle Getty of "The Golden Girls" played Sophie in the 
theater's staged reading, but it never proceeded to a full production. He 
rewrote it two years later, but there were no takers. 
</P>
<P>
Next scene: Hollywood, 1986. Getty was working on "The Golden Girls," and 
happened to tell Maslow, a development executive for independent TV producer 
Reuben Cannon, about the wonderful play she once did back East. Maslow met 
Kassin, and told him that he was interested in his play. They shopped it 
around. Still no takers. 
</P>
<P>
And there was another problem. Said Sloan: "Michael is sweeter than I am, more 
sentimental, and some of that came through in the early version. Thom felt that 
the elements surrounding Willa's pregnancy didn't really work, that it needed 
the insight of someone who's experienced giving birth." 
</P>
<P>
Someone such as Sloan, who said, "I tend to write about pain through comedy, 
and this was just that kind of story." Maslow asked Kassin whether, given 
Sloan's strengths, he would let her rewrite his play. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a long look at things," Kassin said. "There hadn't been a significant 
production of the play. Kathy, Thom and I also saw the play the same way, that 
it was about the last chances in life and how women help each other. I based 
Sophie on my great-aunt, who was incredibly resourceful. Kathy had a relative 
who was the same way, so she knew where Sophie was coming from. Besides, I 
retained script approval, so I've never lost control of my work." 
</P>
<P>
Sloan plowed ahead with drafts (the one at the Tiffany is No. 8). "I would call 
Michael and scream 'Help!' into the phone," she said. "I wasn't sure if I was 
wrecking his play, and he assured me not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to write realistically about a single woman who wants a kid, and how 
it's terribly difficult to find people who can be counted on to help when it's 
time. There are moments of doubt and fear during pregnancy, and for women like 
me or Sophie who want control over their lives, it can be terrifying." 
</P>
<P>
Good feelings between the writers didn't mean eternal agreement, however. To 
prevent the comedy from becoming a sitcom, Sloan said, "Sophie had to be tough. 
But Michael wondered early on about some of her tough language." Said Kassin: 
"Kathy and I had some long conversations. She was full of questions." 
</P>
<P>
The only time, though, that Kassin voiced serious reservations with Sloan's 
work was at a reading last October. "He had real problems with changes I had 
made in the story's structure. He thought that whole scenes, mostly in the 
first act, had to go." 
</P>
<P>
More long conversations ensued, but when Kassin viewed a dress rehearsal prior 
to the show's Dec. 15 opening, he was, Sloan said, "pleasantly surprised. I 
think the play could be a lot funnier. But he not only asked for no changes, he 
thought it was a pleasant night in the theater." 
</P>
<P>
Maslow's only worry about "Sophie and Willa's" development is that it "sets a 
precedent. All three of us talked about that. I'm concerned that some people 
will think about rewriting somebody else's play just like they do in TV or 
film, where there's a terrible lack of respect for writers." 
</P>
<P>
His concerns, though, are mitigated by one of the cold realities of show 
business: "I don't think what we did will happen again, because people seldom 
trust each other enough in this business to allow what Kathy and Michael did. 
They were concerned about the characters' relationships on the stage, not 
making deals. That's why it worked." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sophie and Willa" plays at 8 p.m. Thursdays through Sundays at the Tiffany 
Theatre, 8532 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, through Jan. 14. (213) 652-6165.

CHAGALL POSTERS CELEBRATE HIS ART; 
</P>
<P>
THE UNIVERSITY OF JUDAISM DISPLAYS ITS LITHOGRAPH COLLECTION FROM ONE OF THE 
MASTERS OF 20TH CENTURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The University of Judaism in Bel-Air is celebrating the holidays with a 
symphony of images -- free-flying angels, clowns, musicians, animals -- 
depicted in the posters of Marc Chagall. 
</P>
<P>
An exhibit of 22 lithographic posters designed by the artist and produced in 
conjunction with two French printers will run at the university art gallery 
through Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the lithographs were produced in the 1960s for Chagall exhibits in 
Europe. Several promoted the opening performances of operas for which Chagall 
also designed interiors and costumes. One work, titled "The Tribe of Gad," is 
based on a study of his renowned stained glass windows in Jerusalem 
representing the 12 tribes of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
James Jacobson, chairman of the University's Fine Arts Council, said the show 
represents a cross-section of the artist's considerable body of poster work. 
</P>
<P>
The Chagall posters have been in the university's private collection for three 
years, Jacobson said, but this is the first time they have been on public 
display. They are for sale, with prices averaging about $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
The artist collaborated on the lithographs with Fernand Mourlot and Charles 
Sorlier, two eminent Parisian printers whose names also appear on the works. 
</P>
<P>
Chagall prepared the designs, sometimes using details from his painting or 
sketches. The design was then reproduced on zinc and stone engraving plates. In 
the collaborations with Mourlot, Chagall actually took part in the printing, 
physically pulling the lithographs off the plates, Jacobson said. The artist 
supervised Sorlier's work, but was not involved in the printing to the same 
extent, Jacobson said. In most cases, hundreds of posters were printed based on 
a design. 
</P>
<P>
Chagall's name has been in the news recently along with several other 
20th-Century masters as the result of federal and local investigations into the 
sale of forgeries by private dealers and galleries. Some of the forgeries 
included supposed Chagall graphics. 
</P>
<P>
The posters at the university exhibit were donated from the private collection 
of a Los Angeles-area doctor three years ago, Jacobson said. Although he said 
the risk of forgery can never be completely ruled out, he said officials "have 
good reason to believe" the works are genuine. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the more striking works on display have roots in Chagall's love of 
music and grew out of his projects in set design and decoration at opera houses 
around the world. The opera posters are a swirl of color and serene floating 
figures that populated Chagall's artistic universe, evoking the content of the 
operas while remaining distinctly personal. 
</P>
<P>
A poster for Bizet's "Carmen" at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 1966 
includes a portrayal of Sir Rudolf Bing, the opera director who commissioned 
the work, as one of the central characters. There is a poster for a 1967 Met 
production of Mozart's "The Magic Flute" with sets and costumes by Chagall. 
</P>
<P>
A poster for a 1964 Paris production of "Romeo and Juliet" is based on the 
artist's preliminary sketches for the ceiling of the Paris Opera. The ceiling 
design was commissioned by writer Andre Malraux, then Minister of Culture, and 
executed by Chagall as a gift to the city of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Among the others, a 1963 lithograph has significance for the present day as 
change sweeps Chagall's native Russia. The poster, entitled "Revolution," was 
commissioned for a French government-sponsored exhibition of socially relevant 
artwork entitled "Painters as Witnesses of their Times." Chagall based the 
poster on a 1937 sketch depicting his vision of the aftermath of the Russian 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
In a poem about that time, Chagall wrote: "Russia was covered with ice. Lenin 
had turned it upside down, the way I turn my paintings." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chagall exhibit at the Platt Gallery, University of Judaism, 15600 
Mulholland Drive, in Bel-Air, is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through 
Thursday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Friday. The gallery is also open weekends during 
concerts at the university. For information call (213) 476-9777.

I felt stunned and sad when I read what Bill Cosby had to say about his 
daughter in Lawrence Christon's Dec. 10 article. 
</P>
<P>
I do not know anything about Erinn Cosby, but I do know that wherever she is 
tonight, she is filled with sorrow at seeing those words in print. 
</P>
<P>
One of the loneliest experiences a human being can have is to be the recipient 
of blame and condemnation by a parent. 
</P>
<P>
It is a common but tragic mistake to single out one child as being "the 
problem" in a family. Parents blame the battle on the child's stubbornness 
(never mind their own stubbornness) and believe the only way out is for the 
child to capitulate. There are no winners in this struggle. We need a new 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
How can we teach our children to be open-minded and understanding unless we 
first display such qualities toward them? How can we teach children (or anyone) 
compassion if we put labels on them? 
</P>

 Cosby, who has characterized his approach as "tough love," was critical of his 
23-year-old daughter, calling her stubborn and untrustworthy. Erinn Cosby was 
treated earlier this year for alcohol and cocaine abuse.

Many kudos to Cosby for saying: "Even if we have to put in our schools more 
courses in religion and human behavior we have to find ways to convey 
self-strength. We gotta get that to our children." 
</P>
<P>
He is so right. Unless we get back to the old-fashioned family values, our 
country will continue to become a wasteland of crime, corruption and unbridled 
morals.

I have a lot of respect for Cosby; it's his series that gets on my nerves. "The 
Cosby Show" has been plagued from inception with two serious flaws: incessant 
male-bashing and the non-existence of character development. 
</P>
<P>
With regard to the first point, how many episodes must there be in which the 
women are forever cool and calm and the men true idiots? It there an 
intelligent woman alive who falls for this cheap pandering, and is there an 
intelligent man alive who doesn't see what the show is up to -- trying to "buy" 
female support? 
</P>
<P>
In regard to character development, I'd like to see the "Cosby" 
writing/production staff differentiate, other than by age and appearance, the 
children. Each is virtually identical, with a single, collective personality -- 
cutesy-poo/boring. 
</P>
<P>
As for Phyllicia Rashad's character, the all-knowing, all-seeing Claire 
Huxtable, she smiles an awful lot for an attorney. Has she ever lost a case? 
Has she ever had a case? 
</P>
<P>
"Cosby" may usually be No. 1 or close to it, but I fear it's put there by 
people whose favorite restaurant is McDonald's, whose automobile windows are 
adorned with "Baby on Board" signs and whose major source of news is the 
National Enquirer.

Cosby complains because his daughter Erinn rejects his philosophy and the 
strings attached to it, which include a magnanimous educational opportunity 
that, evidently, his other four children readily accept. Apparently Bill's 
university degrees haven't helped him much, because even parents in the poorest 
straits intuitively give support and love to all their children -- even those 
who stray from the mold.

PANAMA OPERATION HURT BY CRITICAL INTELLIGENCE GAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER and MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At H-hour, 1 a.m. Wednesday, a team of 20 Navy SEAL commandos stole onto 
Paitilla airfield intent on disabling the airplanes that Panamanian dictator 
Manuel A. Noriega was expected to use to flee the massive American onslaught. 
According to intelligence reports, the airfield was lightly defended. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of the expected cakewalk, the SEALs encountered three armored 
personnel carriers full of heavily armed and well-trained troops. A "hellacious 
fire-fight" ensued. Carrying only light machine guns and demolitions for the 
aircraft, half the SEAL team was killed or wounded. 
</P>
<P>
And evacuation of the casualties was hampered because the SEALS had set their 
radios to a different coded frequency than the one used by the pilots of the 
Medevac helicopters. Eventually, the airport was secured, cutting off one 
escape route for Noriega and closing down an airfield that could be used to 
reinforce the Panama Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
The battle of Paitilla field illustrates a set of basic problems and failures 
that marred what otherwise appears to have been a meticulously planned and 
crisply executed assault, perhaps the most ambitious joint U.S. military 
operation since World War II: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Repeatedly, U.S. units with critical missions were hampered or frustrated 
entirely by poor intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At the field command level, at least, U.S. commanders underestimated both 
the strength and the determination of the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Despite massive force, U.S. troops were not prepared for the violence, 
looting and anarchy that erupted in Panama City after the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"Our military objectives were limited, perhaps too limited," a senior 
Administration official said at week's end. "They did not include political 
realities. To paraphrase (Prussian military strategist Karl von) Clausewitz, 
politics is war by other means. If you ignore the political objectives, then 
you're not pursuing the war properly." 
</P>
<P>
Divide, Destroy 
</P>
<P>
About 22,500 U.S. troops, coming from a total of a dozen different military 
bases in the United States and Panama, mounted separate actions across Panama 
to divide and destroy Noriega's forces. Despite the complexity of the 
operation, the initial assault appears to have been carried out with surprising 
precision, considering its scope and the distance many American units had to 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
Paratroop drops were performed with precision; early targets quickly seized. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials portrayed the massive military operation as 
brilliantly conceived and masterfully executed. The Panamanian military was 
quickly neutralized, Noriega was driven into hiding and a government 
democratically elected last May was installed before sunrise. There appear to 
have been few of the snafus that marred recent U.S. military operations in 
Iran, Grenada, Beirut and the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
But according to many government and private analysts, the invasion suffered 
major flaws. Critics inside and outside the government listed a catalogue of 
American mistakes and miscalculations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- U.S. planners failed to anticipate the civil anarchy that would follow the 
"decapitation" of Panama's government and armed forces and now express surprise 
that they are involved in what the senior U.S. commander in Panama on Friday 
called a "real war." 
</P>
<P>
 -- They misjudged the quality and persistence of continuing resistance from 
remaining elements of the Panama Defense Forces and Noriega's so-called Dignity 
Battalions of young urban vigilantes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- American officials failed because of faulty intelligence to capture Noriega 
at the outset of the operation. They neglected to anticipate that the wily 
fugitive would be able to direct a campaign of sniping and terror that has no 
end in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They failed to prepare for the still-uncounted civilian casualties, 
thousands of refugees and the ill will created by the demolition of the 
civilian neighborhood surrounding Noriega's Panama City headquarters and action 
in other poor residential areas. The U.S. military brought little food and few 
medical supplies to aid wounded and displaced civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And the U.S. military now appears to have bought itself months of 
unexpected occupation duty as the United States tries to restore order and 
build a government amid a restive population in a country where, at least in 
the capital city, the situation has been reduced to chaos. 
</P>
<P>
Admiral's View 
</P>
<P>
"I think our emphasis was mainly on war fighting and we didn't give proper 
consideration to the relationship with the civilian population and to the 
political aspects," said Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., the recently retired 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian people feel more threatened since the Americans arrived than 
they did when Noriega still held power, an Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, we have so far failed in our political objectives because we 
still have to prove to Panamanians that we are better than the guy we 
replaced," this official said. "We still can't offer them more security, and 
therefore our strategy is, in part, failing." 
</P>
<P>
Military analysts called the plan a classic large-scale operation designed to 
divide, decapitate and dismember Noriega's 15,000-member defense forces. It 
was, analysts said, a brute-force approach designed to compensate for the 
Pentagon's unwillingness to run the risk that it might have neither the 
intelligence nor the skill to snatch Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Once Noriega's power base was "neutralized," the military planners assumed 
Noriega himself would quickly tire of the fugitive life and surrender -- or be 
betrayed -- to U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
"That's pretty wishful thinking to think you're going to smoke him out like 
that," one former special operations officer said. "If we didn't have the 
intelligence on exactly where he was, we have done a poor job on penetrating 
his circle." 
</P>
<P>
But some military analysts believe that the strength of Operation Just Cause -- 
its reliance on overwhelming firepower -- also dictated some of its worst 
shortcomings. When the Pentagon chose to mass a multipronged assault with 
traditional military objectives, it assured that U.S. troops, bedeviled by 
communications problems of their own, would be left picking up after a 
shattered political and economic infrastructure amid armed chaos. 
</P>
<P>
Narrow Definition 
</P>
<P>
The military's narrow definition of its job also contributed to the apparent 
contradiction between the ground commanders' rosy assessment of the operation 
and the chaos and resistance that made a mockery of their words. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials said the military plan put into effect Wednesday had been in 
the works for 18 months, constantly updated and reworked. Gen. Colin L. Powell, 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, extensively modified the scheme after he 
took office two days before a group of mutinous Panamanian officers 
unsuccessfully tried to topple Noriega on Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon had undercover commando teams from the Army's Delta Force and the 
Navy SEALS on the ground in Panama continuously after Oct. 3, tracking 
Noriega's movements and relaying intelligence about arms depots and the 
political reliability of units of the PDF, U.S. sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Their surveillance of Noriega was spotty. He often eluded them by moving 
constantly from safe house to safe house in Panama City, and, according to one 
report, using a double to throw trackers off his scent. 
</P>
<P>
During this time, President Bush considered a limited commando operation to 
kidnap Noriega, but it was never tried because the Pentagon never had enough of 
a specialty team in place or adequate intelligence about his whereabouts to 
pull it off, military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, earlier this month, Noriega declared war on the United States, and last 
week an American Marine officer was killed and a Navy officer and his wife were 
beaten and harassed by PDF troops. 
</P>
<P>
Bush ordered the Pentagon to move on Sunday. On Monday, planes began ferrying 
troops and equipment into Panama from bases around the United States. H-hour 
was set for 1 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Among the first objectives of the plan was to collar Noriega -- and in that 
critical assignment the military failed. 
</P>
<P>
Escape Downplayed 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials tried to play down the importance of Noriega's escape, 
portraying the deposed dictator as merely a nuisance "dashing around the 
country," in Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's words. But by the end of the week, 
the intelligence failure came back to haunt the generals, who concluded that 
Noriega was directing resistance from an undetermined hiding place. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday afternoon, U.S. officials began referring to the remaining U.S. 
operations in Panama as "mopping up." That quickly proved embarrassingly 
over-optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
Resistance to the invaders, at first described as sporadic and unorganized, 
grew in scope and sophistication. Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman, the four-star 
commander of the U.S. Southern Command in Panama, said Friday that attacks on 
U.S. troops appeared to be "centrally controlled." He ordered 2,000 
reinforcements flown in from the United States -- and not military police, but 
fresh combat troops. 
</P>
<P>
"This looks like a little bit more than mopping up," one U.S. Marine in Panama 
said Saturday. "Hell, this is rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Thomas W. Kelly, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
said, "No plan ever survives contact with the enemy, and you've got to take it 
the way it comes once you engage in combat." 
</P>
<P>
According to all early accounts, the troops performed crisply on the ground. 
Air drops went off with precision, with none of the bumbling and collisions 
that marked the failed Iran hostage rescue mission in 1979 and the Grenada 
invasion of 1983. 
</P>
<P>
With isolated exceptions, communications and coordination between units was 
described as excellent. The terrain had been well mapped out and targets 
effectively identified, although of course the United States had the advantage 
of a long and important military presence in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Major Panama Defense Forces installations were taken in the first hours of the 
assault, numerous Noriega escape routes were sealed off, and Special Forces 
troops liberated Panamanian prisons, all according to plan. 
</P>
<P>
Precision Planning 
</P>
<P>
The movement of the massive U.S. force was planned with equal precision, said 
senior Pentagon officials: Air Force transports leaving Ft. Bragg, N.C., were 
escorted past Cuba by fighters and airborne jamming and surveillance craft. 
They dropped 4,500 paratroopers on target and on precise schedule after flying 
distances of up to 3,500 miles. 
</P>
<P>
But several analysts said that the elaborate planning left out some of the 
smallest and cheapest details of such an operation, including civil affairs 
specialists and special operations units trained in "psychological operations." 
</P>
<P>
Only a small contingent of these forces, trained in winning the hearts and 
minds of local populations, was included in the operation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst part of it is that I don't see that kind of thinking going on even 
now," said Nestor Sanchez, a former top Pentagon official with long experience 
in Panama. "It's been a Pentagon military operation. Where's the civilian side 
of it?" 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, one knowledgeable source said that the Pentagon's plan did not 
include the use of a special electronic warfare plane that is designed to jam 
the signal of radio and television transmitters. Several military experts said 
that seizure or destruction of the means of communications should be one of the 
first objectives of a military operation. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, a key Panama City radio station continued for at least a day into 
the invasion to broadcast messages from Noriega, leading some of the population 
to believe he was still in control. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, officials said military engineering units were limited to those 
trained strictly in combat engineering jobs. Civil engineers who might have 
helped repair damaged civilian neighborhoods stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's heavy firepower approach to the mission also failed to 
anticipate an effective form of modern warfare -- hostage taking. 
</P>
<P>
As Air Force C-130s and C-141s arrived in waves into U.S. air bases Tuesday 
night, no troops were used to bolster security at the U.S. Embassy. Nor were 
hotels and residential areas full of vulnerable Americans given any special 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials maintained that taking such steps would have been a costly 
diversion of troops from their main objectives. They added that such moves 
might have compromised the secrecy of the mission, although the noisy 
preinvasion buildup tipped off virtually everyone in Panama to what was about 
to occur. 
</P>
<P>
One knowledgeable Army official said the prospect of hostage-taking was a 
deliberately low-priority question: U.S. forces believed that crushing 
Noriega's major fighting units would eliminate resistance. 
</P>
<P>
"People were always confident we could do the military operation," an Army 
officer based at the U.S. Southern Command in Panama said Saturday. "What came 
afterward is what we worried about." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
PANAMA UPDATE 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting 
</P>
<P>
Two thousand fresh American troops were airlifted to Panama, bringing the total 
number of U.S. forces there to more than 25,000, according to the Pentagon. 
U.S. military commanders in the field reported "significant progress" in ending 
resistance and restoring order in Panama City, despite continued clashes with 
irregular forces loyal to fugitive Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Hostages 
</P>
<P>
CBS News reported that pro-Noriega forces had released Jon Meyersohn, a CBS 
producer, and GTE Corp. executive Doug Mullen, an American businessman not 
previously identified as a hostage. "They're both well and were well treated," 
CBS spokesman Tom Goodman said. Meyersohn was abducted Wednesday. Goodman said 
he did not know when Mullen was seized. 
</P>
<P>
United Nations 
</P>
<P>
The United States, Britain and France joined together to veto a U.N. Security 
Council resolution condemning U.S. military intervention in Panama and 
demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops. The resolution, calling the 
intervention "a flagrant violation of international law," was supported by the 
Soviet Union, China and Nonaligned nations. 
</P>
<P>
Casualties 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials reported that, since "Operation Just Cause" began early 
Wednesday, 25 American servicemen and two civilians have been killed, 238 have 
been wounded, and one serviceman is missing. U.S. figures on Panamanian 
casualties were 139 dead and 95 wounded, with 2,250 PDF troops being held 
prisoner.

MIDEAST CONTESTANTS RACE TO BUILD MISSILE ARSENALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NICOSIA, Cyprus 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Middle East, where tanks and air power ruled the battlefields in hostile 
decades past, has entered an unsettling era of mushrooming missile arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last weeks and months, regional military machines have been flexing 
their missile strength at an accelerating pace. The contestants give identical 
rationales for the buildup: to match strides with their rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and Iraq have test-fired powerful new rockets. Egypt is working on 
an intermediate-range missile, and Saudi Arabia has placed in desert silos a 
long-range, nuclear-capable heavyweight bought from China. 
</P>
<P>
Other Middle East nations have stocked a range of battlefield rockets over the 
years. Even Lebanon's beleaguered Christian forces, once armed mainly with 
artillery and hand-carried grenade launchers, are reported to possess a handful 
of Soviet-made short-range missiles, supplied by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a missile race," affirmed Heino Kopietz, a Middle East specialist at 
London's International Institute of Strategic Studies, in an interview Dec.15. 
"Everybody is on their toes now." 
</P>
<P>
Mordechai Gur, a former Israeli army chief of staff, added: "We have to deter 
the use of missiles, full stop." 
</P>
<P>
Technology is bought, adapted or home-developed, and increasingly beyond the 
capability of the United States, the Soviet Union and other major powers 
uncomfortable with the Middle East arms race to restrain. The reduction of 
big-power tensions in Europe has yet to spill over to the region, and Third 
World producers are helping fill the demand for new weapons. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams, commenting on this month's 
Iraqi test, warned that the burgeoning arsenals are "a serious and growing 
worldwide concern." In the taut relations of the Middle East, he said, missile 
proliferation "undermines regional security and peace." 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Soviet Union, whose southern territories are within range of 
Middle East missiles, have expressed similar alarm. 
</P>
<P>
According to military analysts, only Israel among Middle East powers is capable 
of arming missiles with nuclear warheads. But Iraq, Iran and Libya are 
reportedly seeking nuclear technology, and they and several other countries in 
the region are believed to have the potential to develop chemical warheads, 
dubbed by analysts as "the poor man's atomic bomb." 
</P>
<P>
Strategically, the development of missile forces by Iran and the Arab countries 
threatens to upset the regional military balance characterized by superior 
Israeli air power. To keep its foes at bay, Israel had long relied on its 
ability to strike at installations deep in enemy territory without fear of 
immediate retaliation. Its 1981 bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor outside 
Baghdad was a celebrated example. 
</P>
<P>
Now an Israeli preemptive air strike can be countered with the push of a 
button, although Israel's nuclear capability still poses a telling deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
Hedging their bets for a non-nuclear confrontation, the Israelis have embarked 
on a U.S.-supported program to develop an anti-missile missile system called 
Arrow, another notch on the gear of escalation. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Arab-Israeli tensions lies the threat that missile proliferation 
poses to the Arab States and Iran themselves. While battlefield missiles were 
first used in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, long-range missile warfare was 
introduced to the region during the nine-year conflict between Iraq and Iran 
which ended in a fragile truce in the summer of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Each side threw every available type of missile, from every possible source, at 
the other. Soviet-made Scud B rockets, adapted for greater range by reducing 
the weight of the warhead, fell on both Baghdad and Tehran. The Iran-Iraq war 
also reintroduced another ominous weapon, poison gas, which had not been used 
so extensively since World War I in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"The use of missiles was legitimized during the Iran-Iraq war," said Shai 
Feldman, a researcher at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
French-supplied Iraqi fighters pounded Iranian shipping in the Persian Gulf 
with French-made Exocet missiles (and accidentally hit the U.S. frigate Stark 
in 1987, with the loss of 37 American lives). The Iranians countered by 
deploying Chinese-made Silkworm anti-ship missiles along the gulf's strategic 
Strait of Hormuz. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, alarmed by the buildup, went on the market and bought the 
ponderous Chinese CSS-2 East Wind missiles, which have an range of up to 1,800 
miles, depending on the warhead. The East Wind can carry nuclear warheads to 
the maximum range, but the Saudis insist they have no intention of becoming a 
nuclear power. Independent observers say the missiles are being retrofitted 
with conventional warheads, which would limit the range to 1,000 miles, still 
sufficient to hit targets in Iran, Israel or elsewhere in the Middle East, 
though without pinpoint accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Few Restraints 
</P>
<P>
Kopietz, the London analyst, labeled the Saudi weapons a "psychological 
cosmetic," but added that that is what spurs proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
"The Saudis are telling Iran, 'We can buy these and we can use them,' " he 
explained. "The Iraqis are building their own because neither the Soviet Union 
nor the United States will sell them a missile." 
</P>
<P>
In the race to match missile for missile, there have been few restraints except 
price and availability. And even those restraints are being evaded by the 
ambitious development and adaptation programs in Iraq, Iran and Egypt, which 
reportedly is receiving technical help from Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, seven Western industrial nations, including the United States, 
Britain, Japan, France and West Germany, formed the Missile Technology Control 
Regime, with the aim of curbing the spread of missiles with a range of 180 
miles or more. The signatories are committed to block the sale of missile parts 
and related equipment to Third World countries. But the commitments have proven 
less than airtight. 
</P>
<P>
According to the chief prosecutor in Munich, a West German company has sold 
components for a rocket valve to Libya. An official with the French firm 
Aerospatiale told a reporter at this year's Baghdad air show that his company 
was prepared to "respond to any need of the Iraqi defense production." The 
official was quoted as saying that negotiations for the transfer of missile 
technology were under way. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to press reports, Libya's Moammar Kadafi is shopping in 
the missile market, reportedly for the Brazilian-made Oteiba, which has a 
375-mile range. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Strides 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's claim on Dec. 7 that it had launched a 48-ton rocket into Earth orbit 
and developed two models of 1,200-mile-range military missiles surprised even 
analysts who had closely followed its wartime and postwar efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"We achieved a complicated scientific leap," Military Industries Minister 
Hussein Kamel, brother-in-law of President Saddam Hussein, told Baghdad Radio. 
" . . . We successfully tested the launching of the a three-stage rocket to 
outer space." 
</P>
<P>
Not until 48 hours later did U.S. officials authenticate the claim. 
</P>
<P>
"I can confirm that the Iraqis have launched a rocket powerful enough to put a 
small payload into space," said a Pentagon spokesman. Another Defense 
Department official said the North American Aerospace Defense Command had 
tracked an object "for four or five revolutions" of Earth, although it was not 
clear whether it was the final rocket stage or a payload. 
</P>
<P>
Kamel said the test was the first phase of a space program, presumably aimed at 
putting a spy satellite into orbit over the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-mile-range missiles that Iraq claims to have developed would have 
direct military application. 
</P>
<P>
At United Nations headquarters in New York Dec.14 Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq 
Aziz said of the intermediate-range rocket: "We have to take into 
consideration, for defense purposes, that our country is still being threatened 
by Iran. We are in a position of no war and no peace." 
</P>
<P>
Threat to Israel 
</P>
<P>
The same weapon could reach Jerusalem, as can the Scud B rockets fired at 
Tehran during the war. They have a range of about 570 miles, boosted by more 
than 150 miles through alterations reportedly designed with the help of West 
German engineers. Syria, Egypt and the Saudis also own missiles capable of 
hitting Israeli targets, and the Soviet-supplied Syrian SS-21 Scarab missiles 
have a high degree of accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
There has been no Iraqi claim that their new intermediate-range missiles have 
been tested. Intelligence reports on Iraq have focused instead on development 
of an advanced version of the Argentine Condor rocket, reportedly in 
collaboration with the Egyptians and the Argentines. In the Middle East, the 
rocket has been dubbed Badr 2000, and has a projected range of about 600 miles. 
</P>
<P>
More alarming than Iraqi success with a mid-range rocket would be the potential 
of the tested space booster, which could put Iraq in a satellite-launching club 
with Israel and developing countries such as India and China. Theoretically, 
the booster could be adapted for use as an intercontinental ballistic missile, 
some Western experts noted. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate is considering further legislation to combat the spread of 
ballistic missiles, although the effort seems to be aimed primarily at Syria 
and Libya rather than Israel, an ally of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that the likelihood of Great Britain, France or Israel 
engaging in atomic/biological/chemical weapons is anything but remote," said 
Arizona Sen. John McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, 
speaking on a television hook-up to a recent conference in Tel Aviv. "I don't 
have confidence" about Hafez Assad, the Syrian president, or Kadafi. "So the 
legislation and the effort I have been engaged in have clearly tried to 
differentiate those countries I have mentioned and those which are less stable 
and are in fact more aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
However, Kopietz, the International Institute of Strategic Studies analyst, 
argued that Israeli power is the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"To end this race," he said, "America will have to get Israel to step down 
first" in any disarmament program. 
</P>
<P>
"For the time being, these weapons are being sought by people for essentially 
defensive purposes," Don Kerr, another IISS analyst in London, declared before 
the Iraqi test. "These states want to be listened to." 
</P>
<P>
Israel, meanwhile, has moved ahead with its own rocket program. In September, 
in a report that Israeli officials refused to confirm or deny, the Soviet news 
agency Tass said Israel had test-fired a surface-to-surface missile from an 
area near Jerusalem 900 miles west into the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
Other reports identified the missile by the code name Jericho 2, the same 
rocket that put a satellite into orbit in September, 1988. The Israeli Jericho 
1, current kingpin of their missile force, has a range of 375 miles and can be 
fitted with chemical, conventional or nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nuclear technology is also being sewn throughout the region. A West 
German company and China are said to have provided Iraq with technology to 
produce enriched uranium, the key ingredient for building nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has reportedly helped South Africa build a long-range missile in return 
for guaranteed supplies of enriched uranium and facilities to test booster 
rockets in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department, in response to reports of Israeli-South African missile 
and nuclear cooperation, pressed Israel to sign the international Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, but Israel has refused. The Israeli government does 
not confirm that it has nuclear weapons, and compliance with the treaty would 
open its nuclear facilities to international inspection. 
</P>
<P>
At the U.S.-sponsored conference on arms control two weeks ago in Tel Aviv, Jed 
Snyder, a Pentagon consultant, said that Israel should drop its non-nuclear 
pose to make its nuclear threat "credible." 
</P>
<P>
Nick Williams reported from Nicosia and Daniel Williams from Jerusalem.

ROMANIA: DEATH TOLL SOARS IN FIERCEST BATTLES OF THE WEEK. GORBACHEV AFFIRMS

<TEXT>
<P>
The fiercest battles yet in a week of bloodletting rocked the Romanian capital 
of Bucharest on Saturday amid reports that deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu 
is under arrest by the army. There was convincing evidence that the death toll 
nationwide rivals the loss of life in Hungary's ill-fated 1956 uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Well-armed Ceausescu loyalists and army troops supporting the popular uprising 
against his tyrannical rule clashed into the night Saturday. The center of 
Bucharest was said to be under army control, even though troops still had not 
been able to dislodge the last pro-Ceausescu snipers, some of whom seemed 
determined to fight to the death. A new counterattack was considered possible. 
</P>
<P>
"The vipers' screams will soon cease!" Radio Bucharest promised late Saturday. 
The radio and state-run television both have remained in the hands of 
anti-Ceausescu forces since early Friday afternoon despite persistent efforts 
by Ceausescu loyalists to oust them. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of total deaths during three days of fighting in the Romanian capital 
ranged to 1,000 or more. Television film showed dozens of bodies piled in 
hospital corridors. 
</P>
<P>
In the western city of Timisoara, where the current uprising began with a 
massacre of protesting civilians last weekend, Western reporters were told 
early Saturday that the official body count had already reached 4,082. 
Searchers were still digging up mass graves, and the count is expected to top 
12,000. 
</P>
<P>
Combined with unknown numbers of dead in other cities where heavy fighting has 
been reported, including Arad, Cluj, Siliu and Brasov, the final toll -- if it 
is ever known -- seems sure to rival or surpass the 1956 Hungarian revolt. The 
official death toll in that revolution was 6,000, although unofficial estimates 
of fatalities ranged up to 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
There were signs that the high-water mark of the fighting may have been 
reached, and an emergency Warsaw Pact foreign ministers' meeting on the 
Romanian situation, originally expected to be convened today, reportedly was 
put off pending further developments. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev affirmed the Soviet Union's support 
for the Romanian uprising, pledging Saturday to provide "immediate and 
effective humanitarian aid" to the country. But he told the Congress of 
People's Deputies that the Kremlin had turned down a request by Romania's 
provisional, pro-democracy government that was formed Friday for military 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
In Bucharest, Ion Iliescu, a member of the so-called Front of National 
Salvation, as the provisional government is known, announced Ceausescu's 
detention on national television but gave no details of his capture. 
</P>
<P>
It was assumed that the reported capture of Ceausescu, whom the provisional 
government vowed to put on trial, would discourage some of the die-hards still 
holding out. 
</P>
<P>
The state broadcast media had previously given conflicting reports on 
Ceausescu's fate, reporting at various times that he had been captured, 
escaped, been captured again, and fled the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, are under arrest and being held by the 
army," Iliescu told viewers. "His son, Nicu, and Ilie Ceausescu (Nicolae's 
brother and a former deputy minister of defense) are also being held." 
</P>
<P>
State television showed a bruised Nicu Ceausescu in custody Friday, but by late 
Saturday had offered no such proof of his father's capture and no clue as to 
where the deposed dictator might be held. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day Saturday, fighting raged in Bucharest. Foreign and Romanian 
television, monitored in the West, showed dramatic film of anti-Ceausescu 
forces pinned down by pro-Ceausescu snipers, and of tanks and army and civilian 
riflemen returning fire toward nearby buildings where their attackers were 
believed entrenched. 
</P>
<P>
Unarmed civilians ran through the field of fire to bring food to the television 
station's defenders. Before dawn Saturday, young people armed only with 
homemade bombs fought beside soldiers against a furious onslaught by members of 
the dreaded Securitate security forces and a little-known, elite commando unit 
called "the Third Force" that is said to be answerable only to Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting raged almost continuously all day in several parts of the city, and 
television footage showed bullets tearing into buildings whose facades were 
already badly pockmarked and whose windows were blown away. 
</P>
<P>
Clashes were reported in several other Romanian towns as well, including 
Timisoara, where an estimated 100 elite Securitate troops reportedly parachuted 
into the area from helicopters late Saturday in order to reinforce comrades 
still holding out against the army. 
</P>
<P>
The television station was doubling Saturday as a detention and interrogation 
center for other Ceausescu loyalists rounded up by the army, and it remained 
the focus of some of the city's fiercest battles. 
</P>
<P>
At one point Saturday, state television urged people living in areas of heavy 
fighting to leave their homes so the army could better flush out pro-Ceausescu 
security agents. 
</P>
<P>
"Please evacuate these areas in order to let the army move in," a spokesman 
pleaded. "Go to your relatives and friends in other parts of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Battles also focused Saturday on Bucharest's main airport, where a contingent 
of Red Cross workers who managed to bring in two small planeloads of supplies 
reported that they had counted 40 bodies and treated 300 wounded. The capital 
was closed to commercial flights. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking of something which is on a scale which, were it to happen in 
London, would overwhelm the casualty abilities of all our hospitals," David 
Wyatt of the British Red Cross said. "And, of course, Bucharest is not London." 
</P>
<P>
An international aid effort for Romania was gaining momentum Saturday, although 
the continued fighting in Bucharest and the uncertainties of highway travel 
into the country from Hungary were holding up delivery of important medical 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Radio Bucharest reported that 7,614 people arrested in Timisoara 
had been executed, far greater than the hundreds originally reported killed in 
the massacre of anti-Ceausescu protesters last weekend. On Friday, residents 
began digging naked bodies, their feet bound with barbed wire, from mass graves 
around the city. 
</P>
<P>
"The Securitate have . . . surpassed everybody's expectations of their 
ruthlessness and their pathological violence," an Oxford University Romania 
expert, Mark Almond, said in an Independent Television News interview broadcast 
here. "And I'm afraid that they will probably be treated like rabid dogs." 
</P>
<P>
So far, protesters reportedly have treated captured Ceausescu loyalists 
relatively well, but their mood is clearly turning darker with each day of 
additional killing by the Securitate. 
</P>
<P>
Television film Saturday showed soldiers having to fire in the air in order to 
protect captured pro-Ceausescu gunmen from angry crowds kicking and punching at 
them while shouting "Death, death!" 
</P>
<P>
There also were unconfirmed Romanian broadcast reports Saturday that elite Arab 
commandos had joined the pro-Ceausescu forces. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been snipers around on rooftops during the day, and there have been 
reports that some of those are Middle Eastern terrorists," British diplomat 
Jonathan Lamb said in a televised interview from Bucharest. "We don't know 
whether that's true. It's conceivable that if this is put out by the democratic 
forces, it is part of an attempt to gain Western support. But perhaps there's 
something in it. We simply don't know."

<TEXT>
<P>
The last organized military support for deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel A. 
Noriega collapsed Saturday, and Panama's new U.S.-approved leaders began 
efforts to form and run an actual government. 
</P>
<P>
According to European diplomats involved in the negotiations, the garrisons at 
five important provincial capitals have pledged their allegiance to the 
constitution and the new government sworn in after thousands of American troops 
invaded early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was clear that the optimism caused by the surrenders and the 
announcement of army reorganization had not brought all violence in the nation 
to an end. 
</P>
<P>
Shots continued to ring out in Panama City on Saturday night, and there were no 
reports of sizable surrenders, captures or suppression of the so-called Dignity 
Battalions, paramilitary units formed by Noriega last year to terrorize his 
political opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega remained at large. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of the estimated 15,000 officers and enlisted men of the old 
Panama Defense Forces, commonly called the PDF, agreed to give their allegiance 
to the new, U.S.-installed civilian government and to restore order in their 
areas. But small numbers refused. 
</P>
<P>
Both the diplomatic sources and Panamanian military officers say the newly 
loyal troops already are searching for members of Dignity Battalions and others 
still supporting Noriega, once the "maximum leader of Panama." 
</P>
<P>
The agreements were reached between the five unit commanders and Vice President 
Ricardo Arias Calderon and U.S. Gen. Marc Cisneros, commander of the U.S. Army 
South, which is based at Ft. Clayton near the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said that the Roman Catholic Church mediated the pact and will 
act as its guarantor, particularly concerning a pledge by Cisneros not to 
attack or otherwise molest the Panamanian forces. 
</P>
<P>
"The PDF wasn't so much against the new government," said one European 
diplomat, "as it was afraid of the American forces. Once it was clear the 
Americans wouldn't attack them, they were willing to support the new leaders." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly important was the surrender of the garrison in the city of David 
in the northern jungle province of Chiriqui, considered a Noriega stronghold 
and the likely place for him to hide and direct any anti-U.S. guerrilla action. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, the unit commander, Col. Luis A. del Cid, is one of those who 
was indicted, along with Noriega, in a U.S. federal court in Florida on drug 
trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
Del Cid told a news conference Saturday in David that he only wanted assurances 
of fair treatment and already had begun operations against irregular forces in 
the jungle. No one would discuss the possibility of his extradition to the 
United States on the drug charges, a major concern in the case of Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The other units switching are in Santiago, Los Santos, Boca del Toro and 
Chitre. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of this generally optimistic turn, and in the face of misleading 
assurances Friday afternoon by Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman, commander of the U.S. 
Southern Command here, that there had been no battles in the previous 24 hours 
in Panama City, other American officers and eyewitnesses reported constant 
fire-fights between the invading army and resisting Panamanian units. 
</P>
<P>
Mortar Attacks 
</P>
<P>
American troops Saturday morning launched several mortars against forces of the 
Dignity Battalions entrenched in a jungle preserve on the edge of Ft. Clayton, 
which is about six miles from the Panama City limits. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. units also came under fire early during the day near the U.S. Embassy and 
the residence of American Ambassador Arthur Davis. Residents of Via Espana, a 
well-to-do neighborhood, watched as Dignity Battalion members exchanged gunfire 
with a hovering U.S. helicopter gunship. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting has caused the deaths of 25 American soldiers and the wounding of 
238, with one still missing. On the Panamanian side, at least 139 PDF members 
have died in action, 95 are reported wounded and 2,250 have been captured. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Thurman said in a news conference that 15,500 weapons have been seized by 
his troops. 
</P>
<P>
Further weakening Noriega's ability to carry out a sustained resistance was the 
surrender Saturday of the so-called Palace Guard, a PDF unit that protected the 
presidential residence and offices in downtown Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
The building was occupied by U.S. troops in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
And to prevent the military institution that was the Panama Defense Forces from 
reconstituting itself as a danger to his government, President Endara on 
Saturday announced the official dismantling of the PDF, which was the nation's 
sole military, police and security organization before its defeat by the 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
He said it would be replaced by a smaller organization called the Public Forces 
of Panama and will be limited essentially to police and other public order 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
Force Reduction 
</P>
<P>
The new organization ultimately will be reduced in size to about 3,500, 
according to diplomatic sources, and will be headed by Col. Roberto Armijo, a 
troop commander in the old PDF. 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo (Billy) Ford, the second of Panama's two vice presidents, said in an 
interview that Armijo was not associated with the corruption, violence and 
mismanagement of the PDF. "He was the senior officer among the decent officers" 
in the old military, Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
The second in command is another controversial ex-PDF officer, Col. Eduardo 
Herrera Hassan. He was dismissed by Noriega in 1987, allegedly because his 
popularity among the rank and file was a challenge to the dictator. 
</P>
<P>
Hassan was brought back to the PDF in 1988 to head special corps of riot troops 
called the Dobermans to suppress rising anti-Noriega civil unrest. Although he 
succeeded in that mission with bloody efficiency, Hassan was again fired and 
has been living in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Ford insisted that for the first time since the American invasion and the 
resulting anarchy, looting and vandalism have eased. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, travels Saturday through Panama City neighborhoods from the almost 
unbelievably poor sections of the inner city to the opulent areas of Altos de 
Gulf showed that at least in daylight people were behaving civilly. 
</P>
<P>
But the shattered store windows, the burned-out buildings, the hulks of wrecked 
vehicles blocking intersections and the stomach-turning smell of smoldering 
debris were all reminders of the utter chaos and lawlessness that have ruled 
the streets since the American invasion. 
</P>
<P>
No accurate figures are available, but prominent businessmen said the damage 
will run in the tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Street Interviews 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear from interviews with people on the streets whether law and order 
were being restored -- there were occasional American military patrols seen and 
some U.S. soldiers guarded key intersections and food stores -- or that there 
was simply nothing left to loot. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Thurman emphasized that many Panamanians had been awaiting the arrival of 
the American troops and had welcomed them. Moreover, he said, in many cases 
they had identified members of the Dignity Battalions so that U.S. troops could 
capture them. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday saw the evident spontaneous creation of pro-government vigilante 
groups in the streets, armed men who established barricades and were actively 
seeking out Dignity Battalion members. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, American military patrols were disarming the vigilantes but not 
replacing them in any strength. The leader of one vigilante group that captured 
four Noriega followers and found three machine guns in the trunk of their car 
said he called the U.S. military and was promised an immediate patrol. Six 
hours later, no American personnel had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The existing danger also was underlined by the new government's refusal to 
publicly identify the members of the new Cabinet appointed to administer 
affairs of state. "We can't announce them because of security reasons," Vice 
President Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
Careful Handling 
</P>
<P>
Although Endara, Arias Calderon and Ford have been extreme critics of Noriega 
and overwhelmingly defeated the general's handpicked candidate in last May's 
presidential election, they are handling the matter of his military followers 
as if it were a fragile egg. 
</P>
<P>
"We're screening (the military) for loyalty," Ford said, "and the loyal and 
decent military will remain." But even those culled will not be punished, the 
vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no revenge against the military who fought against the takeover. 
They will not be shot, jailed nor persecuted. But they will be required to lay 
down their arms," he added. 
</P>
<P>
He even indicated a sense of mercy for the usually despised Dignity Battalions, 
members of which nearly beat him to death with iron bars last May. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want repression nor reprisals," Ford said. "But we have to have them 
turn in their weapons."

POOR EMPLOYEE RELATIONS, RIGID WORK RULES IMPAIR IMPROVEMENT IN MAIL SERVICE

<P>
The scene is Columbia Heights Post Office in Washington, D.C. It is Thursday 
afternoon, one hour before closing time. Seven people are in line. 
</P>
<P>
A chatty clerk is admiring the new gold belt that a friend is dangling before 
the cloudy plastic window that separates clerks from the public. "What are you 
doing this weekend?" she asks. "Nothing," her buddy replies. 
</P>
<P>
At the next window, a co-worker weighs a brown paper package and tosses it at 
the parcel cart, missing on the first try. 
</P>
<P>
At the third window, a customer taps her yellow pick-up slip on the counter as 
the voices of clerks in the rear office seep through the walls. 
</P>
<P>
"All Services," the signs at each window position read. No service, the Rev. 
Alfred Owens fumes as he stomps out of line and out the door. 
</P>
<P>
"You would think you would have more people. It makes me angry!" he says. "Once 
you get to the window, you have no problem, but I never wait over 10 minutes. I 
leave and come back. . . . I'll try again tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Window clerk is a coveted position among the U.S. Postal Service's 800,000 
employees. It gives the public a regular glimpse into the workplace culture of 
one of the nation's largest employers. 
</P>
<P>
Postal officials, fellow employees and outside experts agree that the service 
needs to adapt to technology and change the way its employees interact if 
productivity is to improve and financial disaster is to be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
So far, old habits appear to be holding on. 
</P>
<P>
Although the post office has spent more than $500 million on automation in the 
last year, it has not saved money or improved services. This failure raises 
questions about whether its rule-bound work force can be turned around fast 
enough, or at all. 
</P>
<P>
This semi-governmental bureaucracy is organized along military hierarchical 
lines. Postal work is characterized by strong unions, rigid work rules and 
powerful seniority rights. It is carried on in an antiquated factory atmosphere 
that attempts each day to serve millions of customers for about 25 cents per 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
"The more centralized an organization is, the more it takes a first-class 
upheaval to change it," said Harrison Trice, professor of organizational 
behavior at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University. 
</P>
<P>
The current impetus for change is simmering discontent at all levels and an 
atmosphere of entrenched habits and attitudes on the part of both management 
and employees. 
</P>
<P>
The disciplinary and grievance procedures outlined in the largest union's 
contract have become a main channel of workplace communication, which at times 
seems absurd. In Falls Church, Va., a letter carrier received this written 
warning: 
</P>
<P>
"On Jan. 9, 1988, you were instructed to have your mail ready at each delivery, 
to take all obvious shortcuts and to walk with a normal gait; not to take 
'little baby steps.' On Jan. 21, 1988, you failed to do so." 
</P>
<P>
In Philadelphia, a new postmaster tried to reduce absenteeism by taking 
across-the-board action against workers who were out more than three times in 
12 months. When one clerk died on the job, union activists blamed his death on 
the postmaster's work rules. It was later determined that the employee had died 
of a drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
In Indianapolis, the postmaster ordered injured employees who returned to work 
but asked for light duty to sit in a large, glass-enclosed room in the middle 
of the work floor and read mail manuals -- an apparent effort to humiliate them 
into returning to regular duty. 
</P>
<P>
In northern Virginia, American Postal Workers Union local president John C. 
Clements wrote members of his chapter last April: "I have noticed a disturbing 
trend developing -- that desire to 'quietly' resolve out our problems. . . . At 
the risk of sounding hard core, I must make the following statement: Labor 
peace is management's goal, not the union's!" 
</P>
<P>
The posture of the two largest postal unions regarding change are as different 
as their two leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Morris (Moe) Biller, 74, president of the 370,000-member American Postal 
Workers Union since 1980, is an old-line fighter who has refused to let his 
rank-and-file participate in employee involvement groups, which are supposed to 
give workers a say in problem-solving and management of their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, when the Postal Service announced that Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. would 
operate mini-post offices in its stores, Biller called out the troops. Union 
members mailed Sears thousands of letters of protest, some of which contained 
torn credit cards. In July, the Postal Service relented. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Vincent Sombrotto, 66, president of the 315,000-member National 
Assn. of Letter Carriers since 1978, is known as a reformer. He has embraced 
attempts to involve employees directly in decision-making about their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
At the local level, managers see first-hand the lack of communication between 
supervisors and employees. Part of the problem, postal and union officials say, 
is that citing one of the thousands of rules in the official work manuals often 
takes the place of reasonable discussion. 
</P>
<P>
"Supervisors don't know how to make decisions unless they can find it in a 
book," said Phillip Tabbita, special assistant to the president of the American 
Postal Workers Union. "Common sense goes out the window and good relations go 
out the window." 
</P>
<P>
Tabbita cited as an example the way budget-related mandates get translated into 
work orders. For example, if headquarters decides that cost constraints force 
it to keep sick leave down to 3% of any work week, officials will send that 
directive down the line. At the end, the message goes out to supervisors on the 
work floor that they must keep the sick leave taken by the crew on each of 
their shifts within that limit. If someone is on maternity leave and someone 
else has an accident, the allotment for the entire crew is used up. 
</P>
<P>
Management "tortures the supervisors in the process, and they torture our 
people," Tabbita said. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, the line supervisor can never stand alone and take the blame 
for poor relations with their employees," Rubin Handelman, president of the 
National Postal Supervisors Assn., wrote supervisors in September. "The blame 
must also be pointed toward a supervisor's boss." 
</P>
<P>
Visits to mail-processing facilities and post offices in Washington and its 
Maryland and Virginia suburbs, in Philadelphia and in San Diego and New 
Orleans, pointed up that, at its core, the Postal Service provides factory jobs 
to baby boomers in a white-collar era. 
</P>
<P>
The workplace, for most, is a noisy, drab assembly line for getting someone 
else's personal belongings -- the mail -- in and out the door. 
</P>
<P>
To get through their shifts, some employees said, they mentally remove 
themselves from their work, which is limited to tasks strictly defined in the 
labor contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of my business I have on the side, or what the stocks are doing," said 
Chuck Muller, 33, who sorts mail by hand in San Diego. ". . . I'm not even here 
when I'm at the (work station)." 
</P>
<P>
Felicia McFail, a window clerk at the main post office in Alexandria whose 
supervisor described her as "the best in the business," lights up when she 
talks about the professional calligraphy she does on the side. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, a visitor clocked McFail and two other clerks at the window: 12 
transactions in 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The pace was slower in the back room, where mail is sorted. One clerk was 
re-sorting miss-sorted mail. One was hand-counting pieces of stamped 
business-reply mail for refunds of excess postage to the recipient. Another was 
trying to trace missing packages. Another was hand-stamping letters, 
"Insufficient address." 
</P>
<P>
Work life is complicated because the postal hierarchy is superimposed over 
workers who have more formal education than their predecessors and may feel 
they have a right to more direct control of their workday. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the 1970s, we never told the union anything other than what we were 
required to do," said Deputy Postmaster General Michael S. Coughlin. 
</P>
<P>
The Letter Carriers' Sombrotto said that in the past, "Management had goals and 
objectives. They sprung it on you, you grieved, went to arbitration and 
litigation; ultimately, they won if they were right." 
</P>
<P>
To try to overcome the us-versus-them attitude, the Postal Service set up what 
it calls employee involvement teams. There are also management involvement 
groups for supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
But progress has been uneven. 
</P>
<P>
The process, said William Burrus, American Postal Workers Union executive vice 
president, is an instrument to weaken the bond between employee and union, and 
"a way to get around the collective bargaining process by talking directly to 
employees." 
</P>
<P>
Post offices and union locals have found ways to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
It was the union that pushed for and won training for new window clerks, and 
that set up a nationwide task force on child care. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego and northern Virginia, the local presidents meet regularly with 
top managers and join in occasional pep talks or gripe sessions on the work 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1982, the National Assn. of Letter Carriers has allowed its rank and file 
to participate in employee involvement groups, of which there are now about 
5,000. The number of grievances has been dramatically reduced. 
</P>
<P>
While the major contribution of some of these groups has been as simple as 
getting microwave ovens for post offices, there are also experiments in 
self-managed work. 
</P>
<P>
At one Washington post office, employee teams have taken on the jobs of their 
supervisors. For a year, employees have come up with work schedules and 
monitored daily performance and the general administration. Their post office 
was recently honored as the only one in the district to have twice exceeded 
minimum postal standards for productivity, overtime reduction and safety. 
</P>
<P>
"It's working well," said Joseph Henry of the union's involvement team. "The 
whole process of changing human behavior is a long-term process. We're probably 
still looking four to five years away."

<P>
At the gigantic mail-processing center in New Orleans, 22 clerks sit in front 
of pigeonholes, the kind used 214 years ago by Benjamin Franklin's office, 
slowly examining each letter before placing it into its proper, numbered niche. 
</P>
<P>
Mail handlers unload letter trays from trucks, wheeling them inside where 
others haul, lift, toss and sort mail all night and half the day. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of this scene from the 1950s is an island of innovation, the U.S. 
Postal Service's link to the 21st Century: new, electronic sorting machines 
that flush 28,000 letters an hour past blinking electronic eyes and into one of 
100 steel traps, each representing a carrier's route. 
</P>
<P>
But the sorted letters must be picked up again by human clerks and delivered by 
human carriers. In the course of being sorted and delivered, a typical letter 
is touched by 14 humans' hands. 
</P>
<P>
Decades after its first stab at modernizing, the Postal Service -- a 
$41-billion-a-year, government-owned corporation with more employees than the 
U.S. Army -- has undergone the most expensive, traumatic technological change 
in its history. The change has not yet been palpably beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
Having poured $526 million into new sorting machines and other technology in 
the last 12 months, the Postal Service faces a $1.6-billion loss this year, 
declining business growth, lagging worker productivity and raids on its most 
lucrative business by private competitors. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to capture the savings dollar-for-dollar that these machines 
represent or we can kiss the Postal Service as we know it goodby," Robert 
Setrakian, chairman of the Postal Board of Governors, told postmasters in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
30-Cent Stamp Expected 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, U.S. postal patrons can get ready to kiss the 25-cent stamp goodby. 
As Postal Service costs continue to rise nearly 1 1/2 times as fast as 
inflation, the board is prepared to raise postage rates again in 1991, probably 
to 30 cents for a first-class letter. 
</P>
<P>
First-class mail delivery performance was at a five-year low last year, and 
complaints about late mail rose last summer by 35%, despite a sluggish 1% 
growth in mail volume. 
</P>
<P>
Automation was to be the service's hope for a turnaround. But efforts to 
automate have been plagued by poor management and planning, costly changes of 
direction, internal scandal and an inability to achieve the paramount goal of 
moving the mail with fewer people. 
</P>
<P>
With 822 new sorting machines like the one in New Orleans installed across the 
country in the last two years, the post office's total work force declined by 
only 1.1%. In the area most affected by automation, mail processing, the worker 
pool actually increased by 5,131 people, according to postal figures. 
</P>
<P>
Work-force reductions are complicated by union contracts that provide postal 
workers with wages and benefits worth about $20 an hour and contain strict work 
and assignment rules, strong seniority rights, restrictions on the use of 
part-time employees and bans on layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The New Orleans post office is one example of how poor planning from above and 
labor restrictions from below can play havoc with efforts to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
Within an eight-month period, the facility received seven new 60-foot-long 
letter-sorting machines, had two others taken away and another four already in 
the plant retrofitted with new equipment. To make room, concrete walls were 
knocked down overnight and some of the new equipment was used to hold down 
still-drying floor tile. 
</P>
<P>
Despite drastic decreases in the volume of mail handled, the service had to 
hire additional employees: technicians to run the new machines. Postal managers 
were unable to lay off people whose jobs were made redundant by technology. 
Instead, they transferred employees to areas where there was more work and 
adjusted work hours to better coincide with the new mail flow. 
</P>
<P>
Morale Plummets 
</P>
<P>
The changes affected workers' personal lives and depressed morale. "You're 
talking upheaval," said postmaster Charles K. Kernan, general manager of the 
New Orleans division. 
</P>
<P>
About 550 processing clerks on the late-night shift downtown were told to begin 
work at midnight instead of 10 p.m. This meant a 10% pay cut because more of 
the shift occurred in daylight hours. The change also made it impossible for 
many parents to get home in time to send their children to school. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Cola, who works the letter-sorting machine, said his three children now 
must spend the night with his mother-in-law because he gets off later in the 
morning. "The kids don't like it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Postal officials in New Orleans also centralized mail processing so they would 
have more mail to feed into the machines. As a result, 22 of the 34 manual 
clerks in a nearby suburb were forced into the downtown processing center 
because there was no work for them elsewhere. They were put in one corner of 
the facility where they spend the day under-employed, sorting letters by hand. 
</P>
<P>
"The mail is not coming in here so we have to slow down" to avoid looking idle, 
said C. J. Roux, a postal clerk. "We don't want to work ourselves out of a 
job." 
</P>
<P>
The transfer infuriated some longtime employees, who had thought that they 
would be protected in desirable jobs because of their seniority. 
</P>
<P>
"They shuffled me away like an old piece of furniture," said Alvin Coulon, a 
27-year veteran of the post office and one of those transferred to the midnight 
shift in New Orleans. "Nobody knew nothing" about the change. "Nobody can do 
nothing about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With more mail being sorted in processing offices, the goal across the country 
is to have letter carriers spend more time on the street, with larger 
quantities to carry. But some carriers are not happy about that possibility and 
they, too, admit to slowing their work pace. 
</P>
<P>
"They know the future," Joseph Williams, manager of the Carrollton post office 
in a section of New Orleans, said of his disgruntled carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Although automation was planned for years, some offices were caught off-guard 
when it finally arrived. For example, last fall a planned upgrade of some of 
the sorting machines in the main District of Columbia processing center, which 
serves Washington, as well as Montgomery and Prince George's counties in 
Maryland, caused a drop in on-time deliveries from 93% to 79% because postal 
managers were unable to adjust to the temporary shutdown of some equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The standard is 95% on-time arrival. 
</P>
<P>
The most advanced machine in the current automation plan is called a 
"multi-line optical character reader." Its electronic eye can read a five-or 
nine-digit typed or printed ZIP code and up to four lines of address. The 
machine translates the address or ZIP code into a bar code symbol, which it 
sprays on the envelope, then sorts to a particular tray that represents a 
carrier's route. Bar code machines read and sort envelopes that contain the 
codes. 
</P>
<P>
Officials point to San Diego as a model of the way automation should work. The 
success there is due largely to the innovative work of local managers who 
devised their own strategy for using the machines and, more important, figured 
out how to stop the workers from feeling threatened by the change. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a rock in the water," said San Diego division postmaster and general 
manager Margaret Sellers. "You start out with a ripple; if you don't do 
planning, you get a tidal wave." 
</P>
<P>
First, Sellers created an automation team, with five subcommittees to manage 
the change and to sell it to employees. When she received the first sorting 
machine, she put it on display at a post office open house and then persuaded 
union leaders to hold meetings and to walk the workroom floor explaining to 
workers what the machines could and could not do. 
</P>
<P>
"Our reaction at first was against it," said postal clerk Gary Pattee, an 
eight-year veteran. "It was hard to sell it to us because we thought we were 
out of here." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Pattee, like other workers, was encouraged to learn how to operate the 
mechanical letter-sorting machines, and he was paid for doing it on his own 
time. Now his skills and his position are more flexible. 
</P>
<P>
Fast-growing San Diego has been insulated from some of the problems experienced 
elsewhere because redundant employees are used to handle an increasing volume 
of mail. Still, the office has been able to reduce the number of manual sorting 
clerks by 10% during the first year of automation. 
</P>
<P>
The mission of the U.S. Postal Service is indisputably ambitious. Each day a 
work force of more than 800,000 employees in 40,000 post offices and processing 
centers across the country flies, ships, trucks and carries an estimated 537 
million pieces of mail to 92 million households and 7.3 million businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The United States alone produces 40% of all the mail in the world and has kept 
the cost of its first-class stamp well below that of every other major 
capitalist nation. 
</P>
<P>
Postal officials are lobbied by no fewer than 70 industry groups and must 
negotiate compensation and working conditions with four labor unions and three 
managers' organizations. Once a repository for political patronage jobs, its 
relationship with Capitol Hill today consists of 24 annual oversight hearings 
before committees in both houses of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Its work has been made no easier by constant turnover at the top -- there have 
been four postmasters general in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
The history of the service's efforts to automate is one that "makes me want to 
cry when I rehear it," said Deputy Postmaster General Michael S. Coughlin. 
</P>
<P>
D. H. Shepard first invented an "apparatus for reading" addresses in 1951, 
according to records of the Patent Office. A handwritten memoir by Omer M. Long 
in the postal archives shows that during the late 1950s and 1960s the then-Post 
Office Department had the lead in optical character readers. 
</P>
<P>
"We were visited regularly by the foreign engineers trying to learn the state 
of the art," Long wrote. "Unfortunately, management . . . changed so often . . 
. (or was) totally unsuited for the position . . . that we lost all respect for 
lack of performance in the field." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence F. O'Brien, postmaster general in 1965-68, called the post office's 
1960s research and development investment "laughable." 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, then-Postmaster General William F. Bolger announced the invention of a 
nine-digit ZIP code, which made it possible for new machines to read an 
envelope and sort it to a particular carrier's route. Reacting to opposition 
from commercial mailers and the public, Congress put a three-year hold on the 
idea. When the nine-digit code finally became policy, many fewer mailers used 
it than predicted. 
</P>
<P>
There were other problems as well. In one 18-month period, the Postal Service 
gave $25 million in rate discounts to business mailers for using a nine-number 
ZIP code that the new machines could process, but then failed to process them 
on the machines, according to the General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, then-President Ronald Reagan appointed Peter E. Voss to the Postal 
Board of Governors. In 1986, Voss pleaded guilty to accepting kickbacks from a 
Michigan lobbying firm for his help in trying to steer a $250-million 
sole-source contract for optical scanners to Recognition Equipment Inc., a 
Texas firm. 
</P>
<P>
Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said the Voss scandal set the agency back 
18 months in its effort to automate. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign firms now dominate the field of mail-automating equipment. Contracts 
for many of the newly installed machines went to a Texas licensee of a West 
German firm, AEG Telefunken. 
</P>
<P>
This month, reaffirming its long-term commitment to automation, the Postal 
Board of Governors endorsed a five-year strategic plan that will cost more than 
$5 billion. Frank has promised to keep costs 2% below inflation, to achieve 
historic productivity gains and to increase revenues. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a speedboat here. It doesn't turn on a dime," Frank said in an 
interview. "It is changing, it is slow, it is frustrating once in a while, but 
so is every large corporation."

<P>
In 1976, Trudy Pembroke weighed 325 pounds. She was divorced, unemployable, 
estranged from her family and confined to a state hospital in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Her grim history included a feeling at age 9 that something was terribly wrong 
with her. At that age, she did not know that she was a victim of severe 
depression and its devastating consequences. But she was to learn soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
She attempted suicide half a dozen times, beginning at age 16. She was 
frequently hospitalized for her mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
She had her stomach stapled to lose weight and was admitted to a group home. 
But the demons of overwhelming depression won again. Her spirit was broken, her 
fragile self-esteem shattered. She was hospitalized yet again. 
</P>
<P>
Life in a state hospital seemed her destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Pembroke is 41 and weighs 155 pounds. She has her own apartment with new 
furniture. She earned an associate degree in college, bought a new car she 
calls "Baby" and has a new job. 
</P>
<P>
She is out of therapy and off all medication. 
</P>
<P>
Was it a miracle? No, it was nature's medicine -- friendship. 
</P>
<P>
Janice Wittmershaus, 33, a research physicist, was the friend. She befriended 
Pembroke until Pembroke was well enough to be her own friend. 
</P>
<P>
But Wittmershaus' and Pembroke's paths probably would never have crossed if not 
for an unusual nonprofit organization called Compeer. 
</P>
<P>
"Compeer is the best antidepressant in the world," Pembroke said. 
</P>
<P>
Its premise is simply the power of friendship. 
</P>
<P>
Headquartered in Rochester, Compeer began with 10 patients and 10 volunteers 
and was called "Adopt-A-Patient." In 1976, Bernice Skirboll answered a 
help-wanted ad and took over. 
</P>
<P>
She found the name too patronizing and thumbed through her dictionary. She 
found "compeer." The definition: "equal, companion, friend, peer." 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Skirboll registered the name with the federal government, began 
raising money and expanded the group to an organization that has helped more 
than 10,000 mentally and emotionally handicapped people in 119 cities in 37 
states and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The compeer contracts to spend one hour a week with the client for a year. The 
volunteers undergo brief training. They meet with a therapist if indicated and 
submit written monthly reports. 
</P>
<P>
Skirboll said the backup support for each volunteer costs about $450 a year, 
about what it would cost to keep a patient in a hospital for three days. 
</P>
<P>
The program exists from Gainesville, Fla., to Portland, Ore., from Augusta, 
Me., to San Diego and in smaller cities like Grand Haven, Mich., and Great 
Bend, Kan. Each has its own budget, some as high as $150,000. The national norm 
is $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Pembroke decided to go public with her story to try to eradicate the stigma the 
mentally ill suffer. 
</P>
<P>
Her story is that of a product of a broken home, a survivor of foster homes and 
a father she could never please. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have become President of the United States and it would not have been 
good enough for him," she said. "I carried that attitude into my adult life." 
</P>
<P>
She has not seen her father or spoken to him or any of her four sisters in the 
last 10 years, although they all live within 50 miles. Her mother is dead. 
</P>
<P>
"The last time I spoke to him, he said the next thing he wanted to hear about 
me was that I was dead," Pembroke said. "I told him I would abide by his 
wishes, but that I still loved him. His voice cracked a little and he said: 
'OK. Goodby.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I got married at 20 for all the wrong reasons," she said. "I didn't love him, 
but I was fat and ugly and I knew no one else would ever ask me." The marriage 
lasted eight years. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Wittmershaus met Pembroke in 1983, she was living in a halfway 
house, but she was thinking of returning to the state hospital, to the wards 
she knew all too well. 
</P>
<P>
Pembroke was in the state hospital when she was paired with her first compeer. 
The woman lost touch with Pembroke six years later when she moved from 
Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
Bernice arranged for Wittmershaus to take over Pembroke's case. But after the 
second or third visit, Pembroke told Wittmershaus not to bother to come back. 
</P>
<P>
"I did everything I could to sabotage the relationship," Pembroke said. "I 
wouldn't talk to her sometimes when she came." Other times, she would just cry, 
but she could not articulate what was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
But Wittmershaus was as tenacious as Pembroke. She just kept coming back. 
Eventually, they started going out for coffee; they fed ducks on a pond; they 
went window-shopping; they went to the circus, to movies. 
</P>
<P>
"I finally started talking a little bit," Pembroke recalls. "I would ask her 
why she would want to come and see me. Why should anyone care about me? She 
showed me what a true friend is. Since Janice, I know what a relationship is." 
</P>
<P>
Pembroke wanted to return to the hospital. She felt she could not make it on 
the outside. Wittmershaus kept saying: "Yes, you can," words that eventually 
Pembroke came to believe. 
</P>
<P>
When Pembroke started college, as Wittmershaus was studying for her master's 
degree, they would often study together. 
</P>
<P>
After Pembroke got her degree, she had about 35 interviews before she finally 
got a job. 
</P>
<P>
After she had been with Pembroke for three years, Wittmershaus' husband left 
the University of Rochester for a job in Phoenix. But Janet and Pembroke's 
friendship, while no longer an official compeer match, has survived. 
</P>
<P>
Wittmershaus calls Pembroke about twice a month and Pembroke writes to her. 
Last year for her birthday, Wittmershaus and her husband sent Pembroke a 
round-trip ticket to spend two weeks with them in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Pembroke no longer has, or needs, an official compeer. She has made a few 
friends on her own, always with Wittmershaus' encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
Pembroke, blessed with a gift for public speaking, volunteers as a speaker for 
Compeer. She tells her audience she is going to talk about a mentally ill 
person. She then gives her own life story. 
</P>
<P>
Compeer has become more sophisticated than it was in the early days and tries 
to match people with something in common. Wittmershaus and Pembroke really had 
nothing in common, but one example in Harlem reflects the extent to which 
Compeer now tries to make these friendships work. 
</P>
<P>
The volunteer and the client were originally from Jamaica and both were very 
interested in music, especially reggae, the music of the island. So John Bent, 
39, a victim of schizophrenia, became the friend of Howard Clarke, 22, a senior 
at Lehman College. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Robert Smalls of the Macedonia Baptist Church and the Compeer director 
at the Upper Manhattan Mental Health Clinic brought the two together a few 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Bent, whose disease dates from his student days in Manchester, England, has few 
friends and is frightened to leave the house. The voices that bedevil him, 
despite medication, get louder; the hallucinations become three-dimensional. If 
he is with someone, however, it is easier. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke brings records and videos to the four-story walk-up that Bent shares 
with his wife and five children. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the age difference, both are students in their own way. On one of their 
recent visits, Clarke asked if Bent knew anything about the Dutch philosopher 
Spinoza, the subject of one of his classes that afternoon. It turned out he 
did. So instead of listening to music as usual, the two chatted about 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Neal Brown, director of community support for the National Institutes of Mental 
Health in Rockville, Md., said Compeer "seems to be very effective." 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody who has been involved with them has nothing to say but good about 
them," Brown said. He added, however, that the program has not been evaluated 
objectively and scientifically. 
</P>
<P>
The studies in Rochester, where the program began, indicate that Compeer 
significantly cuts the rate of a patient's re-entry into an institution. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of previously hospitalized patients return at some point, mental 
health professionals say. Among the Compeer clients, that number has dropped to 
15%, Skirboll said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Compeer gets some government money, it also gets donations from such 
corporations as Xerox, Citibank, Eastman Kodak, Honeywell, AT&amp;T, General 
Motors and Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Martin von Holden, executive director of Rochester Psychiatric Center, said 
he has 80 Compeer volunteers working in the hospital, a facility with 500 
patients and 200 outpatients. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful way to transition a patient from the hospital to a halfway 
house or group home," Von Holden said.

SOME RESIDENTS OF MARYLAND FIND COUNTY'S SALE OF OWN BRAND OF LIQUOR SOBERING; 
</P>
<P>
SOME SOBERED BY THIS BRAND OF LIQUOR

<TEXT>
<P>
When high school senior Susan Bergeron learned that Montgomery County was 
selling its own brand of liquor, the local official of Students Against Drunk 
Driving was furious. 
</P>
<P>
"How can a county, with its innumerable drug task forces and anti-drug 
campaigns, run liquor stores and, even worse, bottle its own brand of liquor?" 
the 17-year-old wrote recently in a letter to the editor of a local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The question has grown old for county officials, who had hoped the furor over 
its County Crest brand would have died away by now, nearly two months after the 
discount brand of gin, vodka, rum, Bourbon and Scotch went on sale in 
county-run liquor stores. 
</P>
<P>
Introduction of the house brand liquor brought out a flurry of news coverage 
and critical letters to the editors of newspapers. But county officials say 
they only received three critical letters and the issue has quieted. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's put this in perspective, for God's sake. A private label doesn't make 
anyone drink," said county liquor control director Jerome Baylin. "All we're 
saying is if you choose to drink in Montgomery County, please shop here." 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery County buys directly from producers, wholesaling beer and wine to 
retailers but handling sales of liquor through its own stores. County officials 
maintain County Crest is no different from house labels of other large liquor 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
The house liquor is made by a Baltimore distillery, which bottles it in two 
sizes under the County Crest label. 
</P>
<P>
A 1.75-liter jug of County Crest ranges in price from $10.95 for vodka to 
$15.99 for Scotch -- $2 or $3 less than comparable brands, but more than the 
cheapest products. 
</P>
<P>
The affluent county outside Washington, D.C., whose voters opted to control 
alcohol sales at the end of Prohibition, is the first local government in the 
nation to retail its own liquor, said Baylin, who is president of the National 
Alcoholic Beverages Control Assn. 
</P>
<P>
According to the association, which represents governments that directly 
control the sale and distribution of liquor, 19 states purchase liquor and 
either sell to retailers or directly to the public, in addition to Maryland, 
where only Montgomery County does so. 
</P>
<P>
County Executive Sidney Kramer said the sale of County Crest was in keeping 
with the county's goal of controlling liquor sales, as well as a source of 
extra revenue. Some of the revenue raised by the liquor control office pays for 
substance abuse programs, he added. 
</P>
<P>
According to Baylin, the liquor control office has netted $62 million above 
expenses in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
He said it is too soon to know how much money the sale of house brand liquor 
will raise, but the products appear to be "doing exceptionally well, thanks to 
the press." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeron said she was angered by the introduction of County Crest at a time 
when Montgomery County officials have been pressing SADD to abandon its policy 
of neither condoning nor condemning teen-age drinking in favor of a "zero 
tolerance" stance. 
</P>

"Basically, they are saying SADD is sending mixed messages when they themselves 
are doing that," said Bergeron, who is treasurer of the county's SADD chapter. 
"I'm not going to listen to someone who's a hypocrite."

The county government says controlling alcohol sales is better than permitting 
liquor stores on every corner. Neighboring Prince George's County, which does 
not have liquor control, has more than 140 liquor stores, compared with the 23 
government outlets in Montgomery, Baylin said. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Bright, head of the Montgomery chapter of Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving, said there is nothing wrong with liquor control but thinks the county 
should not both regulate and participate in the liquor industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We have enough brands to choose from without the county making its own," she 
said.

<P>
When Eastern Europe's Communist dictators fell, citizens spilled into the 
streets in joyful parades to hail their new freedom. But instead of parades, 
the fall of Panama's dictator brought an ugly wave of looting and surprisingly 
dogged resistance. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons, scholars and former officials said Saturday, include the desperate 
poverty of Panama City's barrios, some of which lie only a few blocks from 
glittering, modern shops, the sharp racial divisions of Panamanian society and 
Latin Americans' traditional resentment of U.S. intervention. 
</P>
<P>
And whatever the reasons for the chaos, it revealed two problems that could 
plague U.S. policy long after the looting is finally quelled: popular 
enthusiasm for the new government of Guillermo Endara appears thin, and the 
ability of Noriega's followers to create disorder remains considerable. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see a lot of support for the Endara government," said Rep. Les Aspin 
(D-Wis.), chairman of the House Armed Forces Committee. "If there isn't support 
for Endara, we have problems." 
</P>
<P>
"Endara is not the strongest political figure you could ask for," said Nestor 
Sanchez, a former senior Defense Department expert on Panama. "To think that 
the 70% vote for the opposition (in last May's election) was for Endara would 
be erroneous. It was a vote against the dictatorship, not a vote for Endara to 
do the job that has to be done now." 
</P>
<P>
The continuing hit-and-run resistance to U.S. forces by Noriega's paramilitary 
Dignity Battalions was also a sign that the job of restoring order may take 
longer than U.S. commanders initially expected. 
</P>
<P>
"The Dignity Battalions are people who had no power or influence before," said 
retired Army Col. William Comee, who served as a staff officer in Panama. 
"Noriega gave them guns and a good measure of discretion. They may not want to 
give that status up voluntarily." 
</P>
<P>
Panama has a long history of living on the edge of disorder. 
</P>
<P>
"Even in the 19th Century, Panama had a reputation as a very difficult area to 
control," said Lincoln Gordon, scholar at the Brookings Institution. "The 
authorities (in Colombia, which then ruled the isthmus) viewed Panama as a very 
difficult place, full of desperadoes, thieves and low-life elements." 
</P>
<P>
Even today, Gordon said, "this is not a highly organized society with deep 
historical roots, and it has no long historical culture on which it is based." 
</P>
<P>
Panama itself, after all, was formed as a nation by outside interests -- 
chiefly the United States, which wanted to build a canal across what was then 
Colombian territory. For most of this century, many of the country's most 
powerful institutions have been American: the Canal, the U.S. Army, the United 
Fruit Co. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, scholars said, Panamanian society has many divisions -- economic, 
racial, political -- but few unifying factors. 
</P>
<P>
Economically, said Brad Barham, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, 
Panama has some of the most visible extremes of wealth and poverty in Latin 
America. As many as 70% of the residents of Panama City live on less than 
$2,000 a year, with most incomes closer to $1,000, he said. Yet because Panama 
is a world trade center with an economy based on the U.S. dollar, prices for 
most goods are very close to U.S. prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Panama is a center for trade, with much wealth at the top, even though most 
people in Panama don't benefit much from it," Barham said. "The poor can see 
all this stuff around them, but it's not really theirs. Imagine what it would 
be like to try to live on $1,000 here in the United States. . . . So when you 
take away the police force, you really open up the channels for a lot of 
pent-up frustration." 
</P>
<P>
The looting can be seen as "an act of social revenge against the country's 
middle and upper classes, who have been repressing the poor in Panama for 
generations, usually with the support of the United States," contended Peter 
Smith, director of the Center of Iberian and Latin American Studies at the 
University of California in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The country's aching racial and ethnic divisions add to the picture. Panama's 
original settlers included wealthy Spaniards and black Caribbean slaves, and 
the class distinctions among them have been rigidly preserved. 
</P>
<P>
"In Panama, those who own the stores are white, Asian, East Indian; those who 
loot them tend to be black, mestizo (mixed native Indian) and mulatto (mixed 
black and white)," said Richard Millett, a professor of Latin American studies 
at Southern Illinois University. "This has been historically true in Panama -- 
that is, the darker, the poorer." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his excesses, Noriega won a measure of real popularity among Panama's 
poor -- in part because he came from one of Panama City's poorest barrios, in 
part because he humbled the country's traditional white politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"Noriega is one of their own who kind of made it through all of the rigidities 
of Panamanian society, in defiance of the odds," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Panama's military leaders have traditionally shown more concern for the 
country's poor than many civilian political leaders drawn, like labor lawyer 
Endara, from the white upper class. 
</P>
<P>
"Historically, it has been the military who really got into civic action with 
the peasants," said Sanchez. "It was not the oligarchy. From the peasant point 
of view, the PDF (Panama Defense Forces) were the ones giving them something." 
</P>
<P>
Many Panamanians initially welcomed the U.S. intervention, of course. But as 
fighting continued through a fourth day on Saturday, some reports from Panama 
suggested that resentment of the U.S. presence was also widespread.

COUNTRIES IN MIDDLE EAST ADDING NEW MISSILES TO THEIR ARSENALS; 
</P>
<P>
ARMS RACE: THE THIRD WORLD MAKES MANY OF THE WEAPONS. MAJOR POWERS ARE UNABLE 
TO CURB A BUILDUP.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Middle East, where tanks and air power ruled the battlefields in hostile 
decades past, has entered an unsettling era of mushrooming missile arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past weeks and months, regional military machines have been flexing 
their missile strength at an accelerating pace. The contestants give identical 
rationales for the buildup: to match strides with their rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Israel and Iraq have test-fired powerful new rockets. Egypt is working on an 
intermediate-range missile, and Saudi Arabia has placed in desert silos a 
long-range, nuclear-capable heavyweight bought from China. 
</P>
<P>
Other Middle East nations have stocked a range of battlefield rockets over the 
years. Even Lebanon's beleaguered Christian forces, once armed mainly with 
artillery and hand-carried grenade launchers, are reported to possess a handful 
of Soviet-made short-range missiles, supplied by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a missile race," affirmed Heino Kopietz, a Middle East specialist at 
London's International Institute of Strategic Studies, in an interview Dec. 15. 
"Everybody is on their toes now." 
</P>
<P>
Mordechai Gur, a former Israeli army chief of staff, added: "We have to deter 
the use of missiles, full stop." 
</P>
<P>
Technology for Sale 
</P>
<P>
Technology is bought, adapted or home-developed, and is increasingly beyond the 
capability of the United States, the Soviet Union and other major powers 
uncomfortable with the Middle East arms race to restrain. The reduction of 
big-power tensions in Europe has yet to spill over to the region, and Third 
World producers are helping fill the demand for new weapons. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams, commenting on this month's 
Iraqi test, warned that the burgeoning arsenals are "a serious and growing 
worldwide concern." In the taut relations of the Middle East, he said, missile 
proliferation "undermines regional security and peace." 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Soviet Union, whose southern territories are within range of 
Middle East missiles, have expressed similar alarm. 
</P>
<P>
According to military analysts, only Israel among Middle East powers is capable 
of arming missiles with nuclear warheads. But Iraq, Iran and Libya are 
reportedly seeking nuclear technology, and they and several other countries in 
the region are believed to have the potential to develop chemical warheads, 
dubbed by analysts as "the poor man's atomic bomb." 
</P>
<P>
Strategically, the development of missile forces by Iran and the Arab countries 
threatens to upset the regional military balance characterized by superior 
Israeli air power. To keep its foes at bay, Israel had long relied on its 
ability to strike at installations deep in enemy territory without fear of 
immediate retaliation. Its 1981 bombing of an Iraqi nuclear reactor outside 
Baghdad was a celebrated example. 
</P>
<P>
Now, an Israeli preemptive air strike can be countered with the push of a 
button, although Israel's nuclear capability still poses a telling deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
Hedging their bets for a non-nuclear confrontation, the Israelis have embarked 
on a U.S.-supported program to develop an anti-missile system called Arrow, 
another notch on the gear of escalation. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Arab-Israeli tensions lies the threat that missile proliferation 
poses to the Arab states and Iran themselves. While battlefield missiles were 
first used in the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, long-range missile warfare was 
introduced to the region during the nine-year conflict between Iraq and Iran, 
which ended in a fragile truce in the summer of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Each side threw every available type of missile, from every possible source, at 
the other. Soviet-made Scud B rockets, adapted for greater range by reducing 
the weight of the warhead, fell on both Baghdad and Tehran. The Iran-Iraq War 
also reintroduced another ominous weapon, poison gas, which had not been used 
so extensively since during World War I in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"The use of missiles was legitimized during the Iran-Iraq War," said Shai 
Feldman, a researcher at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
French-supplied Iraqi fighters pounded Iranian shipping in the Persian Gulf 
with French-made Exocet missiles (and accidentally hit the U.S. frigate Stark 
in 1987, with the loss of 37 American lives). The Iranians countered by 
deploying Chinese-made Silkworm anti-ship missiles along the gulf's strategic 
Strait of Hormuz. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, alarmed by the buildup, went on the market and bought the 
ponderous Chinese CSS-2 East Wind missiles, which have a range of up to 1,800 
miles, depending on the warhead. The East Wind can carry nuclear warheads to 
the maximum range, but the Saudis insist they have no intention of becoming a 
nuclear power. Independent observers say the missiles are being retrofitted 
with conventional warheads, which would limit the range to 1,000 miles, still 
sufficient to hit targets in Iran, Israel or elsewhere in the Middle East, 
though without pinpoint accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Kopietz, the London analyst, labeled the Saudi weapons a "psychological 
cosmetic," but added that that is what spurs proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
"The Saudis are telling Iran, 'We can buy these and we can use them,' " he 
explained. "The Iraqis are building their own because neither the Soviet Union 
nor the United States will sell them a missile." 
</P>
<P>
In the race to match missile for missile, there have been few restraints except 
price and availability. And even those restraints are being evaded by the 
ambitious development and adaptation programs in Iraq, Iran and Egypt, 
reportedly with technical help from Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, seven Western industrial nations, including the United States, 
Britain, Japan, France and West Germany, formed the Missile Technology Control 
Regime, with the aim of curbing the spread of missiles with a range of 180 
miles or more. The signatories are committed to block the sale of missile parts 
and related equipment to Third World countries. But the commitments have proven 
less than airtight. 
</P>
<P>
According to the chief prosecutor in Munich, a West German company has sold 
components for a rocket valve to Libya. An official with the French firm 
Aerospatiale told a reporter at this year's Baghdad air show that his company 
was prepared to "respond to any need of the Iraqi defense production." The 
official was quoted as saying that negotiations for the transfer of missile 
technology were under way. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to press reports, Libya's Moammar Kadafi is shopping in 
the missile market, reportedly for the Brazilian-made Oteiba, which has a 
375-mile range. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's claim Dec. 7 that it had launched a 48-ton rocket into Earth orbit and 
developed two models of 1,200-mile-range military missiles surprised even 
analysts who had closely followed its wartime and postwar efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"We achieved a complicated scientific leap," Military Industries Minister 
Hussein Kamel, brother-in-law of President Saddam Hussein, told Baghdad Radio. 
" . . . We successfully tested the launching of a three-stage rocket to outer 
space." 
</P>
<P>
Not until 48 hours later did U.S. officials authenticate the claim. 
</P>
<P>
"I can confirm that the Iraqis have launched a rocket powerful enough to put a 
small payload into space," a Pentagon spokesman said. Another Defense 
Department official said the North American Aerospace Defense Command had 
tracked an object "for four or five revolutions" of Earth, although it was not 
clear whether it was the final rocket stage or a payload. 
</P>
<P>
Kamel said the test was the first phase of a space program, presumably aimed at 
putting a spy satellite into orbit over the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-mile-range missiles that Iraq claims to have developed would have 
direct military application. 
</P>
<P>
At U.N. headquarters in New York on Dec. 14, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz 
said of the intermediate-range rocket: "We have to take into consideration, for 
defense purposes, that our country is still being threatened by Iran. We are in 
a position of no war and no peace." 
</P>
<P>
The same weapon could reach Jerusalem, as can the Scud B rockets fired at 
Tehran during the war. They have a range of about 570 miles, boosted by more 
than 150 miles through alterations reportedly designed with the help of West 
German engineers. Syria, Egypt and the Saudis also own missiles capable of 
hitting Israeli targets, and the Soviet-supplied Syrian SS-21 Scarab missiles 
have a high degree of accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
There has been no Iraqi claim that their new intermediate-range missiles have 
been tested. Intelligence reports on Iraq have focused instead on development 
of an advanced version of the Argentine Condor rocket, reportedly in 
collaboration with the Egyptians and the Argentines. In the Middle East, the 
rocket has been dubbed Badr 2000, and has a projected range of about 600 miles. 
</P>
<P>
More alarming than Iraqi success with a mid-range rocket would be the potential 
of the tested space booster, which could put Iraq in a satellite-launching club 
with Israel and developing countries such as India and China. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Legislation 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate is considering further legislation to combat the spread of 
ballistic missiles, although the effort seems to be aimed primarily at Syria 
and Libya rather than Israel, an ally of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
However, Kopietz, the International Institute of Strategic Studies analyst, 
argued that Israeli power is the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"To end this race," he said, "America will have to get Israel to step down 
first" in any disarmament program. 
</P>
<P>
Israel, meanwhile, has moved ahead with its own rocket program. In September, 
in a report that Israeli officials refused to confirm or deny, the Soviet news 
agency Tass said Israel had test-fired a surface-to-surface missile from an 
area near Jerusalem 900 miles west into the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
Other reports identified the missile by the code name Jericho 2, the same 
rocket that put a satellite into orbit in September, 1988. The Israeli Jericho 
1, current kingpin of their missile force, has a range of 375 miles and can be 
fitted with chemical, conventional or nuclear warheads. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, nuclear technology is also being sown throughout the region. A West 
German company and China are said to have provided Iraq with technology to 
produce enriched uranium, the key ingredient for building nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has reportedly helped South Africa build a long-range missile in return 
for guaranteed supplies of enriched uranium and facilities to test booster 
rockets in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department, in response to reports of Israeli-South African missile 
and nuclear cooperation, pressed Israel to sign the international Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, but Israel has refused. The Israeli government does 
not confirm that it has nuclear weapons, and compliance with the treaty would 
open its nuclear facilities to international inspection.

The United Mine Workers and Pittston Co. failed Saturday in a last-ditch effort 
to reach a pre-Christmas settlement in a bitter, nearly 9-month-old strike by 
1,700 coal miners in three states. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiations recessed Saturday evening with an agreement that both sides would 
return to the bargaining table Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Government-appointed mediator W. J. Usery, who had said he wanted to end the 
strike by Christmas, told both sides he expected to settle the dispute by next 
Friday, according to sources familiar with the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Usery had the two sides at the table virtually around the clock all week, 
taking a break at midnight Friday but calling negotiators back to the table 
Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a settlement kept Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole, 
who appointed Usery, in Washington -- delaying a trip she had planned to North 
Carolina for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
The miners struck Pittston's coal subsidiary April 5, walking off the job at 
mines in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky after working 14 months without a 
contract.

COLD TIGHTENS ITS GRIP ON THE EAST; FUEL SHORTAGES PERIL SOME AREAS

<P>
Frigid weather chilled the Eastern half of the nation Saturday, overwhelming 
homeless shelters, slickening roads with snow and keeping utilities and fuel 
companies scrambling to meet the demand. 
</P>
<P>
The continuing cold and accompanying snowstorms have been blamed for at least 
80 deaths in 17 states and the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
The Energy Department reported that the weekend cold snap has stretched the 
nation's energy system to the maximum and created "spot shortages" of heating 
fuels along the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, three utilities had to institute "rolling blackouts" because they 
couldn't keep up with demand for power, with Houston most seriously affected 
with 150,000 without service. 
</P>
<P>
Other utilities asked customers to conserve power and shut off service to some 
commercial clients, and heating oil and propane were high-priced and in short 
supply in some areas. Power was also in short supply in Virginia and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The harsh weather also forced homeless people into shelters in major cities, 
sending many into transportation terminals and bank automatic teller machine 
lobbies to seek warmth. 
</P>
<P>
In the lobby of a Manhattan bank, young homeless men wrapped in ragged blankets 
slept on a floor littered with garbage to escape temperatures that hovered 
around 6 degrees. City officials said 9,197 people were housed overnight in 
municipal shelters. 
</P>
<P>
In all, 30 cities from Texas to Alabama established new record lows for 
December. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross in Miami prepared to open three of its hurricane shelters to 
provide a warm haven for the region's homeless, and city officials planned to 
open Bobby Maduro Miami baseball stadium, in a move that could provide shelter 
for hundreds of stranded people. 
</P>
<P>
The airports in Jacksonville and Gainesville closed Saturday because of 
ice-covered runways and several flights in and out of Tallahassee were 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
Record low temperatures gripped parts of Tennessee as the mercury dropped to 8 
degrees below zero in Nashville, smashing a 117-year-old record of 10 below. 
</P>
<P>
The morning low of 11 degrees at New Orleans was the lowest temperature ever 
recorded there, as was a low of 2 degrees below zero at San Angelo, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the hopes for a snowy Christmas in Georgia came a rash of traffic 
accidents on snow-slickened and ice-covered roads and warnings to motorists 
from state transportation officials who urged people to stay at home.

LATEST BOMB CASE LIKELY WORK OF A 'COPYCAT,' OFFICIALS BELIEVE

The package bomb that exploded in the hands of a Hagerstown, Md., judge is 
probably the work of a "copycat" who is not connected to those who sent four 
bombs from Georgia within the last two weeks, killing two people, federal 
officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The latest bombing victim, Washington County Circuit Court Judge John P. 
Corderman, 47, remained in stable condition and under armed guard at a local 
hospital Saturday after a pipe bomb exploded Friday afternoon at his apartment. 
Doctors said they believe Corderman was holding a package containing the bomb 
in his lap when it exploded, rupturing his eardrums and sending 3/4-inch pieces 
of shrapnel into the left side of his groin and right hand. 
</P>
<P>
In the four earlier incidents, each bomb was described as a "nail bomb" and was 
mailed in a shoe-box-sized package postmarked in Georgia. Officials theorize a 
racial motivation in those incidents, since each of the victims had at some 
time been involved in efforts to desegregate school districts in the South. 
</P>
<P>
Federal and local law enforcement agencies are sharing information about the 
five bombings, said Jack Killorin, a spokesman for the Treasury Department's 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. However, he added, there is "nothing 
to establish a tie" between the Corderman bombing and the others. 
</P>
<P>
Killorin said the Hagerstown bomb package was "different in technology," noting 
that there were two bombs in the same package. Investigators said the 
Hagerstown bomb, while deadly, was not as powerful as the other four bombs. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Postal Inspection Service confirmed that the pipe bomb, packaged in a 
Christmas food gift box, was sent through the mail and not through some other 
delivery service, said spokesman Paul Griffo in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses and neighbors had told investigators they saw a man deliver a package 
to Corderman's third-floor apartment shortly before the 2:30 p.m. explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if there was a suspect in the bombing, Killorin declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Robert Frick of the Hagerstown Police Department said he didn't expect to 
have any suspects for at least "the next 48 hours." 
</P>
<P>
Frick said police checked the Washington County courthouse Friday night for 
bombs "just as a precaution to make sure nobody left anything under a judge's 
bench or anything." He said the search did not find any additional bombs. 
</P>
<P>
In the earlier bombings, U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert S. 
Vance was killed at his home in Mountain Brook, Ala., and Savannah, Ga., lawyer 
and Alderman Robert Robinson was killed in his office. Similar bombs were 
discovered and disarmed at a federal courthouse in Atlanta and at an NAACP 
office in Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Killorin noted that many judges and civil rights groups across the country have 
received "phony bomb packages and phony threatening calls" since last week's 
incidents.

MOSCOW PLEDGES AID BUT REJECTS TROOP REQUEST;

SOVIET UNION: GORBACHEV SAYS ROMANIA'S NEW GOVERNMENT CAN EXPECT HUMANITARIAN 
HELP FROM THE WARSAW PACT.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union, affirming its support for the popular uprising that overthrew 
Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu, pledged Saturday to provide "immediate 
and effective humanitarian aid" to the country but drew the line at military 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the Congress of People's Deputies that 
Moscow also is consulting its Warsaw Pact allies so they can coordinate their 
actions in "rendering aid to the people of Romania and some other measures that 
will be taken with this aim." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev told the deputies that the Kremlin had considered a request for 
military assistance by leaders of the Front of National Salvation, the 
provisional government established by former Communist Party and government 
officials, military commanders and intellectuals in Bucharest. But he said 
Moscow had decided against sending in forces as the fighting appeared to abate. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists at the Congress, Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov 
said: "We have to support them from the point of view of medical help and maybe 
some other kinds of assistance, but to bring in forces would, to my mind, be 
impermissible. 
</P>
<P>
"We must not repeat mistakes," Ryzhkov continued. "Not long ago, we reevaluated 
the Warsaw Pact's invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. That reassessment was 
made on Dec. 4, and should we repeat something like that just a few days 
later?" 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said the request for military assistance had come overnight when 
Romanian army units, apparently loyal to Ceausescu, "turned against the people" 
and were threatening to retake strategic positions in Bucharest -- including 
the Communist Party's headquarters, where the provisional government's leaders 
were meeting. But the loyalists' counterattack was "suppressed," Gorbachev 
said, when more troops were brought in. 
</P>
<P>
The Warsaw Pact's foreign ministers had tentatively scheduled a meeting here 
this morning, according to East European diplomats, but they canceled it as the 
situation appeared to stabilize in Romania late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Romania is a member of the Warsaw Pact, along with the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, 
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary and Poland, and the pact's treaty 
provides for mutual military assistance in the case of foreign attack. At one 
point, there were reports from Bucharest that Syrian and Libyan troops were 
fighting on Ceausescu's behalf, but this was never proved -- and was later 
denied by both those countries. 
</P>
<P>
"This victory will be a hundred times more valuable if it is won by the 
Romanian people themselves," a senior Soviet official said. "We would 
definitely act to prevent Ceausescu's return -- by now, that has been made 
clear to all -- but the victory belongs to the Romanian people and must be 
protected and developed by them. In this, they can count on our firmest 
support, but let the actions be theirs." 
</P>
<P>
In a formal declaration Saturday night, the Soviet government expressed its 
full support for both the uprising that ousted Ceausescu and the Front of 
National Salvation. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet people are on the side of the Romanian people upholding the ideals 
of freedom, democracy and national dignity," the Kremlin statement said. "The 
Soviet government supports the efforts of the council of the Front of National 
Salvation aimed at establishing calm and order in the country." 
</P>
<P>
The statement was tantamount to diplomatic recognition of the provisional 
government, officials said, and was aimed at helping to stabilize the situation 
and secure broader support for the Front of National Salvation. 
</P>
<P>
The government statement, following a resolution Friday by the Congress of 
People's Deputies declaring Soviet support for the "just cause of the Romanian 
people," left no doubt of the contempt in which Gorbachev and the other Soviet 
leaders had held Ceausescu, even while he was still lionized in the West for 
his "independence." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, meeting with Ceausescu here earlier this month during a Warsaw Pact 
summit conference, had bluntly told the Romanian leader that either he would 
have to change his policies and his whole approach to governing his country or 
he would be overwhelmed by the same tide sweeping Eastern Europe, according to 
Soviet sources. 
</P>
<P>
"Ceausescu said that he understood Romania's problems and that Gorbachev 
perhaps did not quite understand his own country's," an informed Soviet 
official said over the weekend. "Essentially, Ceausescu said everything was 
under control and would remain so. Gorbachev told him that, aside from the 
political morality of the question, he was making a major error -- that the 
country would blow and take him with it." 
</P>
<P>
In talks with U.S. Ambassador Jack F. Matlock Jr., Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze said that Moscow saw the developments as "the expression of the 
will of the Romanian people striking for a renewal of socialism on democratic 
principles." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, meanwhile, began an airlift of medical and other relief supplies 
to Romania and prepared to send in medical teams to treat those wounded in the 
fighting and evacuate as many as necessary to hospitals here. 
</P>
<P>
The first Soviet aircraft carrying medicine and other relief supplies landed 
Saturday morning in Bucharest, officials here said, but were held up at the 
airport, which had been blockaded by opposing military units. Subsequent 
flights were able to land at other airports, according to Soviet officials. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet journalists working in Bucharest have covered the uprising in Romania 
with unparalleled professionalism, providing a running report on developments 
there with vivid eyewitness accounts of the fighting. At one point Saturday, 
the three-member Tass bureau was forced to evacuate its office when it came 
under fire -- but resumed sending reports within 10 minutes from another 
location.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pockmarked buildings of Bucharest are scrawled with slogans like "Hitler, 
Stalin, Ceausescu" and "Down With Ceausescu and His Clan." 
</P>
<P>
Salvos of bullets ripped the sides of buildings Saturday as units of the secret 
police still loyal to deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu fought running battles 
through the streets and squared off with regular army soldiers who have gone 
over to the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
"This is civil war," said a man in the throng of thousands gathered in a 
central Bucharest square. 
</P>
<P>
Brown-uniformed soldiers huddled in doorways, engaged in machine-gun duels with 
secret police snipers on rooftops as crowds ran amid the bullets or crouched 
behind cars. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, jets flew low over the city, adding to the deafening sounds of 
combat that have rocked the capital since Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
A Reuters correspondent saw trucks roar past with a cargo of coffins -- bound 
for hospitals to bear away the corpses. Hundreds have been killed in the 
capital. Doctors at one emergency clinic said they had at least 60 bodies. 
</P>
<P>
The area around the central Inter-Continental Hotel was closed off by civilian 
volunteers as the security police, the Securitate, fought for their survival. 
They shot into the crowd from rooftops or from helicopters as rebel ranks moved 
into the square in front of the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Trucks and cars were being used as barricades and young civilians armed only 
with clubs checked cars to catch suspected Securitate members. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the confusion and fear, unarmed civilians, many of them wearing red 
armbands, risked the gunfire to help the army overcome the pro-Ceausescu 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
Some climbed on tanks to direct the soldiers against the security forces, or 
even followed them into combat. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the soldiers looked very young -- between 18 and 20. Their uniforms for 
the most part looked old and shabby. 
</P>
<P>
Flames leaped from the presidential palace in Republic Square as tanks ringed 
the building and fired on Ceausescu's forces inside. 
</P>
<P>
"There they are, on the eighth floor, shoot!" one onlooker called to the 
soldiers. A group of more than 50 people stood behind the ring of tanks, 
watching in silence. 
</P>
<P>
The heaviest fighting was around the strategic radio and television buildings 
in the city center, held by pro-democratic forces. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds watched as a Securitate deserter in a green windbreaker jacket 
crouched behind a tree with an automatic rifle, his former comrades as targets. 
</P>
<P>
Announcers on Bucharest Radio alternated between calm assurance that the 
National Salvation Front was in control of the situation and urgent calls for 
the population to help defend the building. 
</P>
<P>
Bucharest television, freed from the yoke of reporting Ceausescu's personality 
cult, showed pictures from the heat of the onslaught around the hotel and 
nearby university. 
</P>
<P>
As dusk fell, thousands sat with tired pro-democracy troops on the pavements or 
clambered over tanks to offer food and then retreat to a cautious distance. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to despise my own nation," said a Romanian, surveying the scene with 
tears in his eyes. "But now I am proud. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
In the square between the Central Committee building and the smoking 
presidential palace, with forlorn gaping holes for windows, small groups still 
shouted "Ceausescu! Murderer!" 
</P>
<P>
Civilians picked their way through piles of shattered glass and broken plaster, 
bearing the blue, red and yellow national flag with the Communist symbol cut 
from the center. 
</P>
<P>
They had discovered a warren of tunnels linking the two centers under the 
square and aimed to flush the Securitate, bunkered down in them for the night, 
out of their refuge. 
</P>
<P>
On the balcony of the Central Committee building, where Ceausescu made his most 
self-aggrandizing speeches during his 24-year reign, ordinary Romanians now 
have their say, telling of the appalling conditions they have endured. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, somebody else spoke for us without consulting us," one speaker 
shouted above the gunfire. "Now we want our own brains to do the work. We are 
now free, and we want to be just like people of the rest of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE ROMANIA STORY 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting 
</P>
<P>
Fierce street battles raged in Bucharest as forces loyal to ousted President 
Nicolae Ceausescu continued to hold out. In Timisoara, where the uprising began 
Friday, 100 elite Securitate troops loyal to Ceausescu reportedly parachuted 
into the area to reinforce comrades still holding out. 
</P>
<P>
Casualties 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of total deaths during three days of fighting in Bucharest ranged to 
1,000 or more. In Timisoara, the official body count had reached 4,082 and, 
with searchers still digging up mass graves, the count there is expected to top 
12,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu 
</P>
<P>
The provisional government announced on television that Ceausescu, his wife, 
Elena, and brother, Ilie, had been captured. Ceausescu's son, Nicu, was 
captured Friday. It gave no details of the Ceausescus' capture but said they 
would be put on trial. 
</P>
<P>
The Reaction 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev pledged to provide "immediate and 
effective humanitarian aid" to Romania. But the Kremlin turned down a request 
for military assistance. 
</P>
<P>
The United States called on all Romanians to lay down their arms and back the 
new Romanian provisional government, saying it "has pledged a transition from 
dictatorship to democracy."

BATTLING SQUATTERS TAKES TIME, ENERGY 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is an hour before dark and the action at the corner of South LaSalle Avenue 
and 27th Street, just west of the USC campus, is just heating up. 
</P>
<P>
Several shabbily dressed men and two thin-legged women are standing in front of 
a boarded-up, two-story fourplex, using hand signals to direct a steady stream 
of foot traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"What ya need?" one of the women asks a man who walks up just as Kerman Maddox, 
president of the LaSalle/Adams Block Club passes by with a visitor. The 
customer's answer is lost in the wind, but the man rushes inside the derelict 
building with the woman trotting behind. 
</P>
<P>
During the next hour, a reporter watches as more than a dozen people either 
drive or walk up to the corner and enter the fourplex and leave minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
"And this is a quiet day," Maddox said wearily. 
</P>
<P>
He then recounted the days when drug trafficking is so heavy that it is 
difficult to pass through the clusters of people blocking the sidewalk, or 
worse, days when drug deals go bad and gunfire erupts. 
</P>
<P>
For a year, Maddox and other members of his group have been battling to rid 
their normally quiet four blocks of neatly kept wood-frame houses of what they 
refer to as "the 24-hour drug supermarket," a vacant building that has been 
taken over by squatters who deal crack cocaine inside. 
</P>
<P>
The block club's battle illustrates how much energy -- and patience -- it takes 
for even a well-organized group of homeowners to rid their area of a problem 
property, even when they have the support of police and government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Many property owners caught in the middle of the city's crack cocaine plague 
complain about the high cost of evicting squatters and repairing the damage 
they have caused. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Police Department's South Bureau, at the request of the block 
club, has officially identified the boarded-up fourplex in the 2600 block of 
South LaSalle as a crack house in need of special attention or "abatement." 
</P>
<P>
The building has been the subject of numerous police raids, narcotics arrests 
and scores of neighborhood complaints, said Officer Robie McIntosh of the South 
Bureau Abatement Unit. The special four-man team is assigned solely to pressure 
landlords into cleaning up their properties and evicting drug-dealing tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of people who live near the LaSalle property have signed declarations 
that police hope to use in a court case to force the owner to rid the building 
of drug dealers or face stiff fines. 
</P>
<P>
According to Maddox, the building is a blight on the neighborhood. Gang 
graffiti have been spray-painted on sidewalks and nearby buildings, and a rash 
of car thefts and burglaries have occurred. After someone fire-bombed the 
building in September, some -- but not all -- of the drug trade moved across 
the street, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the fourplex, Norma Jones Harvey of Los Angeles, said the fire was 
the last in a long series of setbacks that have kept her from rehabilitating 
the property she inherited when her mother died last year. The building had 
been vacant and trouble free for years, Harvey said, until her mother in 1987 
rented to a man whose wife and daughter were addicted to crack. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, who said she was out of work most of last year and now survives on a 
clerical worker's salary, said that as a result of complaints from Maddox and 
his neighbors, and at the suggestion of the police, she evicted all the 
tenants, boarded up the building and hired an on-site caretaker. If drugs are 
dealt from the building now, she said, she knows nothing of it and it is not 
her responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been within the law," Harvey said tearfully. "If someone is in there, 
they have no business being there. I can't go over there and make them leave, 
and the caretaker doesn't have a gun." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey said she cannot go to check on her property during the week because she 
works and would not be caught there at night. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who live on the block who knew my mother have begged me not to come 
there after dark," she said. "They said I might get my head blown off."

Moscow would be aired on Soviet television tonight -- Christmas Eve.

Schuller said he received a telephone call early Saturday morning from Valentin 
Lazutkin, deputy chief of Gostelradio, the state television agency, informing 
him that the 15-minute sermon he videotaped during a three-day visit to Moscow 
in early December would be aired tonight at 10 p.m. in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anything will happen in my life that will top this -- this will 
be the high point," said Schuller, pastor at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden 
Grove. "This makes me feel so good I could cry with joy." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the time difference, the Soviet broadcast will begin just as today's 
first service at the Crystal Cathedral is ending, and a moment of prayer will 
be offered for the Soviet viewers, he said.

NEW ENCAMPMENT FOR MIGRANTS RISES FROM ASHES OF OLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Less than a month after a windblown brush fire swept away their encampment, 
migrant workers already are hammering away in McGonigle Canyon to rebuild their 
illegal community. 
</P>
<P>
Their status as squatters, trespassers on private land, makes little difference 
in their eyes. They are unconcerned that the city has said they must move or be 
moved because their camp fails to meet sanitation standards. To them, the issue 
is simple: They cannot afford to buy or rent area housing, so they must make 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course we're rebuilding. Where else are we going to go?" asked Candido 
Ortiz Leon, 32, a Mixtec Indian from Mexico. "We endure many hardships during 
our adventure here, but we keep on going. We endure." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, Ortiz used a stone to drive a nail into the wood that will provide 
the frame for his new home. A group of young men played soccer on a charred 
clearing nearby. On the singed hillside, workers were out in large numbers 
putting up makeshift walls and roofs. A catering truck hawked burritos and soft 
drinks. Life was returning to the once-bustling site. 
</P>
<P>
The fast-moving fire of Nov. 28 deprived Ortiz and perhaps 100 other immigrant 
workers in the well-established camp, which contains smaller mini-communities, 
of even minimal shelter. The blaze swept through the canyon with flames rising 
50 feet in the air, quickly incinerating one of the area's largest migrant 
laborer encampments, near Black Mountain Road. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was "definitely" set deliberately, although no suspects or motives 
are known, said a San Diego Fire Department spokesman. About 4,500 acres were 
burned, the spokesman said, but no one was injured and no permanent structures 
were damaged, with the exception of a few power lines. 
</P>
<P>
But for those who call the rugged chaparral home, the loss was massive. 
Although permanent structures were spared, the damage for canyon residents was 
comparable to what would have resulted if the blaze had roared through a 
residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Consumed by the flames were cash, cherished family mementos, critical 
immigration documents, prized possessions such as radios and vehicles and 
practical items, from blankets to beds to bicycles. Some said they had as much 
as $2,000 in savings concealed inside their dwellings, much of it to be used 
for trips back to their home nations during the holiday season. Also lost, of 
course, were the simple structures of scrap wood and plastic that they have 
called home. Since the fire, some have slept outside or in some of the 
dwellings that escaped damage. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Perez walked through the ruins of what was once his community, stepping 
over burnt bedsprings, scorched shards of glass and the mangled remains of what 
was once a bicycle. A thriving subculture is glimpsed in the charred debris: A 
letter in Spanish to a parent in Mexico, a notebook of English phrases, a 
fire-blackened medal of the Virgin of Guadalupe. 
</P>
<P>
"These were all little houses," Perez said, gesturing to the seared landscape 
of McGonigle Canyon, sending up puffs of ash with each step. "I lost everything 
I had. Whatever investments I had, they were in that house. It wasn't much, but 
I lost it all." 
</P>
<P>
Perez is not a traditional homeowner, bemoaning his losses after a fire. He is 
a migrant field hand, one of thousands who live outdoors in crude dwellings 
scattered throughout northern San Diego County. They find work here, but are 
unable to find housing they can afford. 
</P>
<P>
Ramiro Martinez also hammered away, constructing a new outhouse alongside the 
charred hulk of what used to be his car. The 47-year-old Guatemalan was at work 
when the fire broke out and unable to move his 1970 Chevrolet Camaro, which was 
engulfed in flames. "Bad luck," Martinez said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
The sound of hammers echoed last week throughout the communities that make up 
the encampment; nails were pulled from the rubble, straightened out and used 
again. In general, the scattered settlements are divided along the geographic 
origins of the migrants. Thus, one area may have a cluster of Mixtec Indians 
from Mexico's Oaxaca state, another may be home to workers from a region of the 
Mexican state of Guerrero, while a third region may have a large concentration 
of Konjobal Indians from northwestern Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
Employers have provided wood and other building materials, the migrants said, 
and the the city of San Diego's Housing Commission contributed $10,000 to be 
distributed by Catholic Charities of the Diocese of San Diego for food, 
transportation, blankets and other emergency needs. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most striking contribution was the dozen or so prefabricated, 
plastic-and-wood multicolored sheds provided by the Rev. Rafael V. Martinez, a 
Protestant minister who runs the North County Chaplaincy, a religious 
social-service agency for migrants. The sheds, which offer considerable 
protection from rain, are a marked improvement over the primitive dwellings 
that are the norm. 
</P>
<P>
"The position of these people is that they ain't going anywhere," noted Rev. 
Martinez, a tireless worker on behalf of immigrant laborers. "There's no place 
else for them to go. If they're forced out of here, they'll just go over the 
hill to another canyon. . . . The rains are about to start, and they need 
places to stay. It's a very frustrating thing. They can't wait until some 
committee somewhere makes a decision to help." 
</P>
<P>
The extent of the destruction underscores the dangers faced by migrants in the 
camps. Most residents are young men, but there also are women, the elderly and 
children. Both documented and undocumented workers are part of the mix. 
</P>
<P>
During what is shaping up to be the driest year in the county's history, the 
handmade structures are a real fire hazard. Built among the brush, often with 
plastic roofs, the hooches can quickly become infernos, particularly during the 
dry months, when population at the camps is highest. Candles, widely used for 
light, are often the catalyst. There is no electricity and limited running 
water. Lives were probably saved in the last month's fire because the blaze 
swept through during the late morning and early afternoon, when most residents 
were at work. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents were able to save their dwellings and possessions by hauling 
water from a nearby stream. Others were just lucky: The fire didn't reach their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, a group of camp residents gathered in a willow thicket to 
celebrate Catholic Mass, as they do each Saturday. They also gave thanks that 
they had survived and expressed gratitude for the support of an outside 
community that has for so long resented their presence. Along with the thanks 
and Christmas cheer, there was also a palpable sentiment that perhaps something 
good may come of the flames that gutted their insular neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"As tragic as the fire was, I think it also provided people an opportunity, for 
the community to reach out to them; it could help bridge the gap of prejudice," 
said Gina Velasquez, a volunteer who has worked extensively in the camp along 
with others from Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Church in Rancho Penasquitos. "Maybe 
the fire brought a little bit of new hope. Any time you're down as low as they 
were, you reach a point where you can't go down any further, and you have to 
look upwards."

<P>
Robert Scarcia remembers the first time he ever laid eyes on the Los Diablos 
migrant camp near Black Mountain Road. He saw rickety shacks made of wood and 
cardboard that, to him, looked like the pictures of native villages in some 
National Geographic magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Nestled in a brushy canyon far from the nearest paved road, he saw campfires, 
their smoke lifting into the crisp morning air. He saw women with timid eyes 
and people asleep on the ground along a dried-up creek bed. 
</P>
<P>
But there was also an irony to what he saw -- the modern-day image of young men 
congregated around a huge catering truck, buying prepackaged food by the 
handful. 
</P>
<P>
The sight was an eye-opener, all right. This was a living, breathing migrant 
community. And it had been set up on his property, Scarcia says, without his 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"It just knocked my socks off," he said about discovering the camp in May. 
"There were these cardboard and wood shacks everywhere and people milling 
around. There was litter and trash all over." 
</P>
<P>
So, guarded by two San Diego police officers, he posted 25 bilingual "No 
Trespassing" signs around his rural 78-acre parcel along McGonigle Canyon. 
Scarcia, who speaks little Spanish, said the men and women at the camp watched 
in silence as he pounded the sign posts into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"The policemen just laughed," he said. "They said the migrants would pull up 
the stakes as soon as we got out of sight. They said signs just weren't the 
answer." 
</P>
<P>
They were right. And, for seven months now, Bob Scarcia has been looking for 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
Since May, when he first learned about the sprawling camp on his land, he has 
twice met with San Diego city attorneys and health and housing officials, 
seeking a solution to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Scarcia is among half a dozen North City West landowners who have been informed 
by the city in recent months that migrant camps on their properties are 
violating a host of city health and fire codes. 
</P>
<P>
And, the owners have been told, it's up to them to do something about it -- or 
the city could do it for them and send them the bill. 
</P>
<P>
That makes Scarcia angry -- having to clean up a mess he didn't make, being 
held accountable by the government for a problem he says is not the least bit 
his making. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked them, 'What should I do? Should I go in there with a machine gun and 
kill every last one of them?" Scarcia said. "I didn't invite these people here, 
but suddenly everybody's pointing the finger at me. 
</P>
<P>
"My taxes pay the salaries of these city, county and federal government 
officials. If laws are being broken, then why aren't the immigration and police 
people doing something about it? 
</P>
<P>
"The government just can't run away from this problem. Something has to be done 
for these people. And they can't just dump the responsibility on the 
landowner." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Scarcia's problems represent the flip side of North County's migrant 
dilemma -- the unsuspecting landowner who finds trespassers on his land and who 
worries about being held liable for what happens to them. 
</P>
<P>
For Scarcia, the investment property he bought 10 years ago with several 
relatives has suddenly become the local focus of an international problem -- 
that of Third World migrant farm workers and their often inadequate living 
conditions in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Now he feels caught in the middle of a tug of war between steadfast city 
officials who demand that health codes be upheld and farm worker advocates who 
would like to see migrants have a place to live, free from harassment. 
</P>
<P>
Exasperated by the city's get-tough approach, Scarcia says he's an innocent 
bystander in a fierce social battle being waged on his land. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm caught smack-dab in the middle," said the 60-year-old retired concrete 
contractor who lives in a cozy, two-story house in Carlsbad with his wife, 
Beverly. 
</P>
<P>
"We're between a rock and a hard spot. If we make these people get off the 
land, we're the heels, we're the bad guys. Well, I don't want the finger 
pointed at me." 
</P>
<P>
Scarcia says he has compassion for people forced "to live like animals." But he 
is also concerned about his liability if any migrant workers are injured on his 
property. There have been several such suits filed in San Diego County this 
year, including one involving a worker who was badly burned in a fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Sooner or later, these people are going to get wise," he said. "And then I'm 
going to be in court, settling lawsuits. In the end, the land won't be mine 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Although they sympathize with the landowners' liability concerns, city 
officials say that they, too, are lost for answers to problems at the Los 
Diablos migrant camp. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real dilemma, that's the best way to put it," said Michael Kemp, a 
deputy director in the city's building inspection department. "But the city's 
primary concern is for the health and safety of anybody who's on that 
property." 
</P>
<P>
There are actually two issues taking shape on Scarcia's property, city 
officials say -- the immediate problem of unsanitary conditions and the larger 
question of the eventual fate of the migrants. 
</P>
<P>
"My intention is to separate the two issues and deal with them one at a time -- 
after all, we're dealing with people here," Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not just bureaucrats reading from a code book. We understand that the 
presence of these migrants is both an international and local problem that the 
federal government hasn't been able to solve. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, the city of San Diego doesn't have the final answers either. But we have 
had some public safety concerns about the camp expressed by nearby homeowners. 
And, as a public agency, we can't ignore those concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Kemp said several landowners have been asked to voluntarily comply with city 
health and fire codes. Although no time frame has been set, city officials also 
have offered assistance once the owners decide on their plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We can assist with litter control and police officers if the owner has 
problems with trespassers," he said. "They'd be there to help keep the peace 
while those actions are being taken." 
</P>
<P>
If no action is taken, the city can legally clear the property at the owner's 
expense, Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we feel the owners are working with us, that won't happen," he 
said. "If not, then we'll consider the other options." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, two weeks after a fire leveled much of the camp, Scarcia learned that 
farm workers were rebuilding their burned-out homes, despite promises from 
migrant advocates that no new construction would begin until the city's code 
violation concerns were resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm mad," he said. "I've been in a position where I've wanted to help 
these people and protect myself from any liability at the same time. But now 
they're sneaking back on without even telling me. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got another meeting next month with the city. And I'm going to tell 'em I 
want these people the hell off my property, pure and simple. After all, it's my 
land." 
</P>
<P>
Scarcia says that, as early as next month, he may seek government help to force 
the migrants off his land. He said he plans on asking migrant advocacy groups 
to help him get the people to leave voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the money to bring in big equipment to level the land," he said. 
"I'll have to rely on the government and the help of these advocacy groups to 
help reason with these people." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Rafael V. Martinez, executive director of the North County Chaplaincy, 
an Encinitas farm worker advocacy group, said he is powerless to stop the 
rebuilding at the Los Diablos camp. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a policeman, I can't stop these people from trying to rebuild their 
homes," he said. "I've told Mr. Scarcia that these politicians set up their 
meetings a month down the road. 
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, they expect these people to remain out in the cold with no shelter. 
It's not going to happen, they've got to have someplace to live." Martinez 
acknowledged that he donated some sheds to the displaced migrants, but that the 
recent camp rebuilding was sponsored by another advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez said that Scarcia and other landowners aren't the only ones caught in 
the middle of a no-win situation. "What about the people who live in these 
camps? 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the time has come where the city is scaring enough of these 
property owners into believing they have nothing to gain by having these people 
on their property. And so they'll move them out. 
</P>
<P>
"But then where will they go? They'll start again at another camp. They'll find 
another canyon." 
</P>
<P>
Another migrant advocate, when asked if he would help get workers to leave at 
Scarcia's request, said: "I'd be very upset if he asked me to do that. I'm not 
going to do someone else's dirty work for them." 
</P>
<P>
No matter what these owners do, the people will come, he said. "They'll come to 
find work because the work is here. And they'll find a place to live on theirs 
or someone else's land. They're not going away." 
</P>
<P>
Scarcia never expected any of these headaches when he first spied the graceful 
parcel of rolling landscape in the late 1970s. He saw no migrants then, just 
wide-open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
"It was beautiful," he recalled. "There was nothing out there back then but the 
Evergreen Nursery, nothing between Rancho Penasquitos and Del Mar." 
</P>
<P>
With the help of a real estate agent, Scarcia, grandfather of two, was 
searching for a piece of investment property, a nest egg to help him and his 
wife enjoy their retirement in style. The plan was to buy early, then let the 
developers come calling when it was time for the houses to be built. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked it because of its location," he said of the property. "There was a 
sense of country privacy, and yet it was only 15 minutes from the city. I knew 
eventually it would be developed." 
</P>
<P>
The developments came sooner than Scarcia ever expected, but they weren't the 
type he had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his 1979 purchase, the land was being leased by the Ukegawa 
Bros. Inc., a North County agricultural firm specializing in tomatoes that used 
farm labor to harvest its crop. 
</P>
<P>
The farm laborers might have worked on his property, Scarcia said, but none 
were living there. 
</P>
<P>
Not long afterward, Beverly Scarcia got a call from a television reporter 
asking what they intended to do about the migrants. The city, it seemed, was 
demanding that both Scarcia and the growers provide workers with fresh water 
and portable toilets during their working hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sitting in the living room and suddenly we saw our property on TV," 
Scarcia said. "The lieutenant governor had come down to get his picture taken 
on my land, demanding that something be done. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to laugh. Suddenly the city was pointing the finger at me, saying I 
should provide the help. I said, 'Why? I don't grow tomatoes. These people 
don't work for me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, the tomato growers moved off the property. For Scarcia, things 
finally began to settle down. He went out to the property twice a year and 
built a dirt road on the land for better access. 
</P>
<P>
"I never saw anyone there whenever I went to the property," he said. "It was 
just me and the land. The place was deserted." 
</P>
<P>
Or so it seemed. By the late 1980s, the area had become home to one of the 
county's largest migrant camps. During the harvest season, more than 600 people 
live in the communities that dot the sagebrush slopes along Black Mountain 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
For Scarcia, that reality hit home in May when he received a letter from the 
city about the health code violations brought to light by nearby homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has met twice with city officials, who have made clear their 
insistence on seeing the land brought under code. Now Scarcia feels forced into 
action. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a human being, I have feelings," he said. "But these people are there 
illegally. Right now, it's a matter of satisfying the city." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Beverly, added: "Basically, it's tough for people like us to afford 
to live here. You can imagine why they can't afford it. So they live on 
people's land. 
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, the big shots in Washington decide on this grand gesture to grant 
them amnesty. But that's it. Now these people are on their own. And they're 
learning that the streets of this country aren't paved with gold after all." 
</P>
<P>
So Bob Scarcia continues to wince at the immediate future, fearing possible 
liability suits, wondering what will happen to the camp on his land. 
</P>
<P>
But his liability fears may be ill-founded, according to an attorney who is 
representing a migrant who earlier this year sued a landowner. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido attorney Terry Singleton said the few suits brought by migrants 
against landowners represent anything but a trend. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, by posting his property, as well as notifying the sheriff and local 
growers that he does not want the migrants living on his land, Scarcia would 
free himself of any liability, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If he does that, I don't think there's a chance in hell that he'd ever be held 
liable," Singleton said, "no matter what happened." 
</P>
<P>
Now more than ever, Scarcia feels like the little guy, a marionette dancing on 
the end of government strings. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting last month, he said, a city attorney told him "that it would be 
heartless" to move anyone during the holidays and that any plans to move the 
migrants should take place after the new year. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Scarcia doesn't see anything that's going to prevent him from having to 
use police help to forcibly move the migrants out. 
</P>
<P>
"I really see no other way," he said. "It's funny, though. In the construction 
business, I've seen these migrant workers throughout my whole career. I've seen 
camps in every canyon and crevice. 
</P>
<P>
"But I never gave it another thought, about the landowners and all that. 
Because I never dreamed it would happen to me."

DEL MAR TRAIN DEPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't save the Del Mar station is my answer to Mr. Paul Frankel ("Limited 
Service Makes Sense for Del Mar Depot," Dec. 11). 
</P>
<P>
It seemed as though your city fathers let you all down when they took the stand 
against any new station being built in Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
The technical advisory committee I was on offered five locations, none of which 
was to their liking. Now they are singing the "Blues in the Night" on how the 
station's loss would create a hardship on your fair city. Maybe it's a time for 
a change of those at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, the new Solana Beach station will be closer to the race track 
than the old one is. Also, the new station will serve Rancho Santa Fe, Solana 
Beach and Del Mar more efficiently. The commuter rail system is designed to 
help eliminate some of the congestion on our highways and byways, reduce some 
of our smaze (smoke and haze) that comes from slow drivers in small towns and 
idling cars on the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
And did you know that Oceanside's rail station is only one block from the 
beautiful, sparkling Pacific Ocean, with the longest pier on the coast? We are 
all for the new rail system and the new station in Solana Beach.

DEL MAR TRAIN DEPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Frankel's article urging retention of the Del Mar Amtrak station, brags 
about 90 dedicated parking spaces and 128 adjacent spaces available to service 
travelers. But the city of Del Mar, in connection with Amtrak, sealed its own 
fate by authorizing the decades-old free parking to be $5 per partial day. That 
means that my late-evening trips to Los Angeles, for morning court appearances, 
with a return by 1 p.m., incur a $10 parking charge. My pleas to have the fee 
$5 per 24 hours are ignored. And I am tired of parking blocks away to avoid 
this. 
</P>
<P>
I'll welcome Solana Beach with its 400 free parking spaces. Kudos to Jim Mills 
for his work in arranging this new transportation center that will serve all of 
North County, including adjacent Del Mar.

THE STORY OF CHRIST'S BIRTH TAKES ON MANY INCARNATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAY: THE NATIVITY CONTAINS ALL THE ELEMENTS THAT MAKE IT A CLASSIC FOR 
THOSE OF ALL WALKS OF LIFE. 
</P>

By MAUREEN BROWN, Maureen Brown, who lives in La Jolla, is the mother of four.

<P>
The tale has all of the elements of the "good story" that a high-school English 
teacher preaches about -- strong character development, rich plot, a sub-plot, 
good setting, pathos and even animals. 
</P>
<P>
And for every person captivated with this tale, there are the small figures of 
Mary, Joseph, the baby and the other Nativity characters that dominated some 
segment of their childhood. 
</P>
<P>
There never appeared a need to enter the debate of a creche on public property, 
roped off for security. The Balboa Park Nativity scene had never met my 
personal criteria for a viable creche. Yet last week, as young and old hands 
meticulously wiped away the paint sprayed by vandals on the park figures, the 
Balboa Park creche took life. For in my lifetime I have concluded that a true 
creche is one that has been touched by human hands. 
</P>
<P>
The Immigrant's Nativity. Although they vary in size, dimension and hue, there 
is always the same underlying narrative that accompanies the immigrant's 
Nativity. The figures of Mary, Joseph and the baby have been gingerly 
transported by hand by those who fled Czechoslovakia, Mexico, Poland or 
Germany. As a childhood friend's Polish mother explained, she had carried the 
tiny figures from her parents' village to the new world where she hoped they 
would become part of her children's history. 
</P>
<P>
The Monsignor's Creche. Generations of children growing up in a northwest 
Detroit parish, deep in a blue-collar neighborhood, received an early education 
in art history from a generous monsignor. Born into a wealthy automotive 
family, the monsignor passed his vacations roaming the European countryside for 
religious art. His parish church was embellished with ornate church kneelers 
and chairs and magnificent oils and sculptures depicting scenes from history 
that absorbed little minds restless during Mass. 
</P>
<P>
On the first Sunday of Advent, the monsignor's creche graced the church lawn. 
Majestic and beautifully carved, it shared a rich history with a neighborhood 
of first- and second-generation immigrants. Time has not dwindled how splendid 
was Mary in her flowing blue gown, gently smiling at her child. No railing or 
rope separated the onlookers from the figures of this creche. One remembers the 
monsignor himself taking small children closer to the figures to partake in the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
The Newlywed's Creche. Purchased during World War II by the newlyweds at the 
J.L. Hudson Store, this terra cotta set was as beautiful as it was fragile and 
held an important place in a front room. The young couple who purchased the 
terra cotta figures could not have foreseen the touching by the little hands of 
seven children or the misplaced balls or careless bumps that would alter the 
creche's appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Each December, the family would carefully unwrap each piece from the J.L. 
Hudson box. Then they would evaluate its condition. Usually, someone was sent 
down to the store to get a new shepherd or king, or to see if they had a cow or 
lamb that could substitute for the damaged ones. In later years, the creche was 
an ensemble of love. With no regard to scale or size, the subsequent additions 
were an assortment of forms. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the original central figures of Mary, Joseph, Jesus and the Angel Gabriel 
of the newlywed's creche survived. True, Mary's nose had disappeared, the Angel 
Gabriel sported only one wing and much of the paint on all the figures had 
eroded, but they had served a family well, to tell and retell the story of the 
Nativity each Christmastide. 
</P>
<P>
The Lincoln Log Nativity. Found years ago in a married-student housing unit in 
Rochester, N.Y., this set was the inspiration of a young mother who allowed 
three red-headed boys under four years of age to play with it as a way to 
occupy the time during the cold and snowy month of December. Every afternoon 
after naptime, as the wind and snow whipped through the housing unit, these 
three little boys constructed with Lincoln Logs a different form of stable for 
the weary travelers to Bethlehem. 
</P>
<P>
The Woolworth Special. Purchased in 1975 at the Fashion Valley Woolworth's, 
this Nativity scene is constructed of rubber with painted exterior. Over the 
years, it has been fondled and lovingly touched by countless hands each 
Christmas. The purchaser always felt she would replace it with a "better set" 
-- upgrade, so to say. The years, however, have diminished the desire to 
replace this set. 
</P>
<P>
The Hanukkah friend, Jane, now 9, who always calls in early December to note 
that she can "help trim the tree," has spent hours arranging the Woolworth's 
Special. She prefers the round set-up approach -- the bambino in the center, 
and everyone in a circle about him. However, her 9-year-old gracious hostess 
promptly rearranges the set, according to her own liking, the moment Jane 
returns home. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, poor post-Christmas packing or carelessness left the kneeling 
shepherd from the Woolworth's special out of the box. Like the traveler left 
behind, the shepherd has spent the year in the office desk drawer greeting 
those who search its contents for scissors and the stapler. 
</P>
<P>
Shall we upgrade the Woolworth's special, asks the father? The mother thinks 
not. She points to its now-developed history of a family and its friends. 
Moreover, responds the mother, an "upgraded" set could be intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
For you see, the mother feels that Nativity scenes are meant to be touched by 
small hands. 
</P>
<P>
Mary, she believes, would concur.

KUDOS TO FIREFIGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On behalf of all the residents in North City West, and particularly those of us 
who live in the Carmel Valley area, I want to thank the San Diego Fire 
Department as well as the other state and local fire departments that helped 
fight the Nov. 28 and Dec. 3 fires. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-foot-high flames swept up the hillside, driven by 50-mile-an-hour winds. 
We watched the fire explode out of the canyons and spread so fast, we were 
genuinely horrified and terrified. 
</P>
<P>
And, as if one fire wasn't enough, five days later the second fire struck. 
Again, residents were threatened by walls of flames tearing through the brush 
and heading for 15 homes on the top of Shaw Ridge. As we stood there watching, 
we felt completely helpless about any possibility of saving homes in the fire's 
path. 
</P>
<P>
But firefighters came to our rescue with extraordinary bravery, expertise and 
determination. Through their coordinated efforts of attacking the fire with 
aerial bombers, helicopters and ground crews, miraculously not one life or home 
was lost in either fire. Under extremely dangerous conditions, we saw 
firefighters put themselves and their lives on the line to save other peoples' 
homes and property. It was an incredible sight and a noble act.

<TEXT>
<P>
I'm amazed by elected officials who fail to understand basic concepts of our 
constitutional government. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff John Duffy complains about the media being big business. Of course the 
newspaper and television companies are out to make money. We call it free 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
Government leaders open their lives to public scrutiny, that's a decision they 
make when they run for office. When they excel, their performance makes good 
reading. When they fail, their performance makes good reading -- the idea is to 
have responsible leaders working hard in office to avoid the latter. The 
concept is commonly referred to as free press. 
</P>
<P>
When free enterprise and free press are taken together, we call it a free 
society. Duffy should have known that.

WAGING PEACE ON INGLEWOOD STREETS; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ASKED FOR HELP AND LOCAL MINISTERS 
RESPONDED. ARMED ONLY WITH BIBLES, THE CLERGYMEN ARE HELPING TO ESTABLISH GOOD 
WILL BETWEEN OFFICERS AND THE COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The heavyset man in the front passenger seat of police car No. 0116 hits the 
hazardous streets of Inglewood once a month. On every tour of duty, he packs 
two standard weapons: "The Bible Promise Book" and "The Witnessing Book." 
</P>
<P>
"I call these my weapons . . . my armaments," said the Rev. D. D. Alexander, 
one of seven volunteer ministers in the Inglewood Police Department's 
2-year-old chaplaincy program, which gives officers religious support in 
dealing with the public. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, a minister at Holy Tabernacle of God Baptist Church in Inglewood, 
notes that the program "helps bridge the gap between the community and the 
Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood's chaplains say that gap exists because each side holds 
misconceptions about the other. 
</P>
<P>
"People see the police as a natural enemy. . . . Generally the police don't 
touch lives of people except when (they) have broken the law," explained 
Chaplain Xavier Carter, himself a former policeman. 
</P>
<P>
Since joining the program, the chaplains have consoled bereaved families, 
victims of violent crimes, and physically and emotionally abused spouses. As 
part of their work, they periodically accompany police officers on ride-alongs, 
seeing firsthand what the officers encounter daily and providing counseling and 
assistance where appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"Ride-alongs are interesting because you don't know what's going to happen from 
one day to the next," said Alexander, a husky but soft-spoken man. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent Friday, Alexander, wearing his clerical collar and the department's 
official gray chaplain's jacket, sat behind a secured 12-gauge shotgun as his 
partner for the night, Officer Ramona V. Reed, drove their black-and-white 
around Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of quiet now," Alexander said, adding that 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. are the 
action hours in Inglewood, a city that had 50 homicides as of last Wednesday. 
Police say most of the killings result from drug and gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
About 6 p.m., Alexander and Reed responded to a family disturbance on Hillsdale 
Street where a man reportedly hit his girlfriend because she left their baby 
unattended. The man had fled. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander talked with the woman and listened as she described the attack. When 
he left, he handed her his business card. 
</P>
<P>
"If you need me, you can give me a call," he said. "I mean that." 
</P>
<P>
The chaplaincy program officially began in October, 1987, when ministers 
responded to the department's call for religious support, said Reuben Taylor, 
crime prevention specialist and coordinator of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-seven ministers attended the first meeting but only nine remained, Taylor 
said. Since then, two chaplains have moved out of state. 
</P>
<P>
The chaplains received 40 hours of instruction in police-related work, 
including courses on the Penal Code and police procedures, and logged 10 hours 
on ride-alongs before they received a chaplaincy certificate. 
</P>
<P>
Although their program was approved by Police Chief Ray L. Johnson, the 
chaplains say they initially encountered resistance from rank-and-file 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We were treated like outsiders," the Rev. Anthony Sanders recalled. 
</P>
<P>
But once the officers realized the chaplains were there to help them and not 
"to beat up on them verbally with a Bible," that attitude changed, said Carter, 
who was a Chicago police officer for 4 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who calls the chaplains "our ambassadors of good will," noted: "It 
takes awhile to gain the trust of police officers." 
</P>
<P>
The chaplains are always on call for emergencies, but they determine how much 
time they can spare for other activities, including ride-alongs, counseling 
victims, writing death notices and helping families arrange funerals. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel there is a reward in it, any time you can help and be of service," said 
the Rev. Victoria Thrash, whose son, Robert, is also a minister and a chaplain 
in the program. 
</P>
<P>
A chaplain's presence can help defuse a hostile situation, Officer Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
"Say you go to a family fight and you have a chaplain there," Reed said. 
"Sometimes the hostile party involved will look at him differently. They look 
at us like we didn't have the right to come in and invade his home. . . . They 
don't question (the chaplain's) presence." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said the chaplains must be given the officer's approval before 
approaching and counseling a victim. During ride-alongs, the unarmed chaplains 
stay out of the officer's way in case the officer must react quickly. And the 
officers protect the ministers from life-threatening situations, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Albert Jones, 66, said the chaplains realize the dangers involved, and 
it is possible to feel "pretty up-tight . . . knowing some people take joy in 
shooting at police." 
</P>
<P>
When Sanders' partner was involved in a drug raid earlier this year, the 
chaplain was told to stay near the car and out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Although he remained in the car, Sanders recalls being frightened. There were 
men with guns, and the situation was confusing because many of the police 
officers were wearing street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not know who were the officers or who were the criminals," Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the chaplains agree, however, that they are not overwhelmed by fear and 
have not encountered life-threatening situations while on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said his experience as a police officer helps him feel comfortable on 
the streets. "I'm not afraid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the potential for danger and the press of other responsibilities have 
caused the Rev. Robert Thrash to reduce his number of rides. Thrash said he 
would feel more comfortable if chaplains were allowed to wear a bulletproof 
vest and carry a handgun for protection. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said concerns of some of the ministers about safety are legitimate, but 
he said they would not be authorized to carry a handgun or wear a bulletproof 
vest because they are not sworn officers. 
</P>
<P>
If an officer is shot while driving with a passenger, the chaplains could call 
for backup and fire a weapon if they had to, Taylor said. In addition to their 
training at the Inglewood station, they can learn how to fire small handguns at 
the Los Angeles Police Department's Advanced Chaplain School. 
</P>
<P>
Between 60 and 80 chaplains from Southern California gather there once a month 
to learn a variety of subjects, from police driving to hostage intervention, 
said LAPD Traffic Officer Ron Moen, who is also a chaplain and has taught a 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation class there. 
</P>
<P>
The Inglewood Police Department is not the only South Bay law- enforcement 
agency with a corps of chaplains. Neighboring El Segundo, Redondo Beach, 
Torrance and Hawthorne also have chaplaincy programs. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's a neat little program," Hawthorne Sgt. Roy McNally said. "We 
have somebody we can call . . . on an emergency basis." 
</P>
<P>
Working on the streets can sometimes be a visceral experience for the 
chaplains. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said: "I cry by myself (and) I cry with my clients, too." 
</P>
<P>
He said the emotional scars he developed as a battered child enable him to 
"establish a real kinship" with his usual clients -- battered spouses. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had the licks like they have," said Carter, a marriage and family 
counselor at Jenesse Domestic Violence Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, the chaplains don't have to go far to find someone who needs 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said many officers, who are often "stressed out" by their daily contacts 
with victims and criminals, need someone to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
When the lawmen see the chaplains, Alexander said, they feel relief and think: 
" 'OK, the man upstairs does care. He sent these guys.' " 
</P>
<P>
The relationships among police officers and chaplains were strengthened in 
March, 1988, when Inglewood undercover Sgt. George Aguilar was shot to death 
while chasing a robbery suspect. Aguilar was the first officer killed in the 
department's 80-year history, and his death rocked the department. 
</P>
<P>
Carter said the chaplains helped the officers sort out their feelings and 
assured them there was nothing they could have done to prevent their fellow 
officer's death. 
</P>
<P>
"Life and death is not something man can call on his own," Carter recalls 
telling the officers. 
</P>
<P>
Father Paul Montoya, one of the department's chaplains, comforted Aguilar's 
family and celebrated the officer's funeral Mass. The funeral was held at St. 
John Chrysostom Catholic Church, where Montoya is parish administrator, because 
it was large enough to accommodate the crowd of mourners. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who attended the Mass were officers from Inglewood and other police 
departments as well as city and county officials. All seven of Inglewood's 
chaplains were present, sitting in a special section, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
"That entire department went to pieces," Carter said. "The police officers were 
naturally time bombs walking around. It's like their own flesh and blood was 
gone." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Johnson agreed that Aguilar's death had a great impact on the department 
and that the chaplains were able to help officers by listening to them and 
acting as emotional sounding boards. 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson: "They are more than worth their weight in gold."

INGLEWOOD: OFFICERS ARE WARNED TO TAKE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS AFTER RECEIVING 
TELEPHONE THREATS. GANG MEMBERS MAY TRY TO RETALIATE FOR THE DEATH OF ONE OF 
THEIR 'HOMEBOYS,' POLICE SAY.

<P>
A 25-year-old man who was beaten and robbed last week apparently was the victim 
of a bungled attempt by street thugs to retaliate against Inglewood police, who 
shot one of their buddies to death a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood police have been told to use extra caution following an attack 
Thursday night on Raymond Mark, whom gang members mistook for a police officer, 
Capt. James Seymour said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark was about to go shopping when he was accosted at 8:35 p.m. Thursday in the 
parking lot of the Home Club store at 3560 W. Century Blvd. Mark said in an 
interview Saturday that he was driving a 1978 Plymouth Fury, a one-time police 
car that he bought about two months ago at a city of Los Angeles auction. 
</P>
<P>
Two men used a gun to force their way into the unmarked car, then drove him to 
a nearby alley where they met several other assailants. 
</P>
<P>
"They got into the car and they just said, 'Move over you (expletive) cop,' " 
Mark said. "I said, 'Hey man, I ain't no cop.' " 
</P>
<P>
The men took his wallet -- which held his last $85 in Christmas shopping money 
-- watch, a gold chain and a jacket. "They hit me over the head with a gun, hit 
me with a pipe and then hit me a couple of times in the face," Mark said. "I 
thought the only reason to take me to an alley was to shoot me. I thought it 
was all over." 
</P>
<P>
Mark said he finally convinced the men he was not a police officer by showing 
them his identification badge from the Hyperion Treatment Plant near El 
Segundo, where he works in a warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
Mark said his assailants told him to walk down they alley, saying: "You're 
lucky you're walking away from here right now, because if you were a cop, you 
wouldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
Mark, a lifelong Inglewood resident, hopped a fence and ran to an apartment, 
where a family let him telephone police. 
</P>
<P>
At 8:52 p.m., police spotted four men driving the stolen Plymouth a dozen 
blocks south of the Home Club. After a chase of several blocks, the Plymouth 
stopped and police arrested three men from Inglewood: Duane Carter, 25; Ivory 
Stewart, 22, and Ruben Young, 18. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth suspect, 20-year-old Kenneth Gaines, ran behind a house on Lawrence 
Street with a gun in his hand and then whirled toward two officers, Seymour 
said. The officers fired, hitting Gaines in the legs. 
</P>
<P>
Gaines was in stable condition Saturday in the jail ward at County-USC Medical 
Center. He and the three other suspects are being held for assault with a 
deadly weapon and kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Mark was treated by paramedics for head injuries and released. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood police say they believe the four men were retaliating for the death 
of Michael (Murder Rock) Washington, 20, reputed to be a member of a Bloods 
gang set. 
</P>
<P>
Officers answered a call on Nov. 24 that shots had been fired near West 85th 
Street and 5th Avenue. Several suspects fled, but Washington allegedly turned 
and leveled a pistol at two policemen, who killed him with two gunshots, 
Inglewood police said. 
</P>
<P>
The four suspects in Thursday's attack belong to another Bloods set that is 
allied with Washington's, police said. 
</P>
<P>
After Washington's death, the Police Department received several telephone 
threats that someone would "get the officer who shot their homeboy," Seymour 
said. Near the shooting scene, graffiti reading "IPD 187" appeared. Police said 
the spray-painted messages -- the abbreviation for Inglewood Police Department 
and the Penal Code section for murder -- are threats. 
</P>
<P>
"I take it very seriously, and I think it's a very serious problem," Seymour 
said. "I think the officers are being much more cautious. They are very careful 
about their tactics and not to put themselves unnecessarily into a position of 
danger." 
</P>
<P>
Mark said he was upset that police did not give him back his $85, so he could 
finish his Christmas shopping, and that he had to pay $90 to free his car from 
an impound lot. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's nice to have my life for Christmas," he said. "At least I have that."

POLICE LOOK FOR MOTORISTS TOO FULL OF HOLIDAY CHEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what is becoming a holiday tradition, South Bay law-enforcement agencies 
have teamed up to patrol local streets for drunk drivers, while other agencies, 
including the Torrance Police Department, are conducting sobriety checkpoints 
on their own or adding more patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
During a two-hour sobriety checkpoint in Gardena on Friday afternoon, police 
stopped 387 cars on El Segundo Boulevard but made no arrests, Sgt. Gary Garrett 
said Saturday. In Inglewood, police made 11 drunk driving arrests Friday night 
at a checkpoint on Century Boulevard and Doty Avenue, but the number of cars 
that passed through the checkpoint was not available, said Sgt. John Hough. 
</P>
<P>
And at a sobriety checkpoint from about 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Thursday night, 
Torrance police stopped 1,066 drivers along Torrance Boulevard, Sgt. Ron Traber 
said. Of those, 15 were investigated for drunk driving and four were eventually 
charged, Traber said. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think (the checkpoint) came as a surprise to anybody," Traber 
said, adding that Torrance police used the checkpoint primarily as an 
opportunity to educate people about the dangers of drinking and driving. Police 
handed out leaflets that recommended designating a non-drinking person as a 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea was to deter people," Traber said. "For our purposes, it went very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Estates police have added an extra patrol car to look for drunk 
drivers, cruising mostly along Palos Verdes Drive West and Palos Verdes Drive 
North, Sgt. Ron Echols said. 
</P>
<P>
And sheriff's deputies have added two patrol cars to be on the lookout for 
drunk drivers in Rolling Hills, Rolling Hills Estates, Rancho Palos Verdes and 
Lomita, said Lt. Stephen Huss of the Lomita Sheriff's Station. The Sheriff's 
Department provides law enforcement for those cities. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the South Bay, seven cities and the California Highway Patrol are 
working in concert to ferret out drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Police departments in Gardena, El Segundo, Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach, 
Inglewood, Hermosa Beach and Hawthorne are pooling resources and officers with 
the CHP to patrol streets throughout those cities. 
</P>
<P>
Each department contributed one or two officers and a patrol car, said Lt. 
David Morgan of the Gardena Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the joint task force efforts, most departments said they are 
beefing up patrols within their own city boundaries, particularly on New Year's 
Eve. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say if you're planning on drinking and driving, plan on bringing a 
toothbrush and a change of underwear," said Morgan, explaining that such 
drivers risk spending a night in jail. 
</P>
<P>
This year, sobriety checkpoint and special patrols in Gardena, Redondo Beach 
and Inglewood were held earlier than usual to target revelers headed home after 
office Christmas parties, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Ken Kauffman of Redondo Beach said studies have shown that police 
departments concentrate their efforts to arrest drunk drivers during evening 
and late night hours, but drunk drivers are also on the road during the period 
just after working hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently a trend has emerged where we were missing dangerous periods, the 
hours after office parties being one of them," Kauffman said.

CHILDREN FIND 'GHOST TOWN' WITH SPIRIT OF THE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the first years of his life, Raul Mateos, 10, lived on a ranch in Mexico 
near Jalisco. There, he said, he regularly rode horses and played in the 
wide-open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, his family moved to El Monte, east of Los Angeles, where he 
lives in a crowded neighborhood near the freeway. His family has suffered from 
the ravages of urban crime: Last year their house was burglarized. 
</P>
<P>
But on Saturday, Raul relived a bit of his younger days. Under clear blue 
skies, he petted horses and played cowboys and Indians on the dusty streets of 
a rickety Western town. 
</P>
<P>
He was one of more than 50 low-income children from the Head Start program, 
some of whom are physically disabled, who came to Johnny Carpenter's Heaven on 
Earth ranch in Lake View Terrace for an old Western Christmas party, complete 
with a barbecue lunch, a generous Santa Claus who dispensed toys, and Christmas 
carols in English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, 75, is a crusty old cowboy who starred in such low-budget 1950s 
Westerns as "Trail of Kit Carson," "In Old Wyoming," and "Santa Fe Saddle 
Mates." 
</P>
<P>
And for more than 50 years, Carpenter has entertained thousands of disabled and 
disadvantaged children at his 3 1/2-acre lot, where he keeps several horses and 
donkeys. He has also constructed a ghost town, complete with the Mangy Dog 
Saloon, a post office and a stagecoach station. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter, who comes from a wealthy Arkansas family, developed the ranch so 
that disabled and other disadvantaged children could play in the wide-open 
spaces and interact with animals. 
</P>
<P>
"A kid that hasn't played in the dirt -- it is physically impossible for him to 
be normal," Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, by his own count, more than 750,000 children have visited the 
ranch. Many have learned to ride horses on the property. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Friedman, 23, of Studio City said he has been coming to the ranch since he 
was 3 1/2. Friedman, who is deaf, was there Saturday, dressed in a Civil War 
costume, to help Carpenter. He said he wanted to be sure the children had as 
much fun as he had when he was young. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter said his efforts on behalf of the disabled are the fulfillment of a 
promise he made while recuperating from a devastating auto accident when he was 
18. Lying in bed with a broken back, a broken leg and a concussion, he vowed 
that if he was ever able to walk again, he would dedicate his life to helping 
the disabled. Carpenter recovered. The inspiration for the ranch came several 
years later, when four blind men came to the stable where he worked and asked 
Carpenter to teach them how to ride horses. At first, Carpenter was skeptical, 
he said, but they persuaded him and eventually became adept riders. That's when 
he decided to open a ranch for disabled and urban children, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Gutierrez, coordinator of the El Monte Options/Head Start program, who 
organized the trip for the children and their parents, said many of the 
children at the ranch Saturday had never been outside their immediate 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The children loved the games, gifts and lunch, but most said the best part of 
the outing was the donkeys and horses. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to pet the donkey," said Julia Franco, 4, as she sucked on a candy cane 
and clutched a Barbie doll she had received from Santa Claus.

A PRESCRIPTION FOR ADOLESCENT MEDICINE MISUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Mary Poppins did it with a spoonful of sugar, but it turns out that to "make 
the medicine go down" can be a tricky business indeed when you're dealing with 
millions of reluctant little sick chicks who need to take it. 
</P>
<P>
It can be a serious problem for adults too, of course, especially for the 
elderly, who tend to amass prescriptions from multiple sources -- prescriptions 
that sometimes interact with each other and cause physical and psychological 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem with children and teen-agers has largely gone unnoticed, even 
though it too can often be dangerous, occasionally fatal. According to Louis W. 
Sullivan, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, of the 
estimated 13 million youngsters who need to take prescribed medicine in any 
two-week period, nearly half -- about 46% -- are taking their medicine the 
wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers came up with this number after reviewing dozens of studies. In 
addition, they found that adolescents were the most likely to make mistakes, 
although the problem exists at all ages, and that "the tendency toward not 
following treatment guidelines holds true even when the medicine is for serious 
illnesses such as cancer and kidney transplants." 
</P>
<P>
They also found that almost 5% of all pediatric hospital admissions were 
related to reactions to or improper use of medicines and that nearly half were 
serious or fatal. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, along with Frank Young, commissioner of the Food and Drug 
Administration, and Paul Rogers, chairman of the board of the National Council 
on Patient Information and Education, last week issued guidelines for parents, 
doctors and children to help solve what they are calling "America's 'other' 
drug problem." 
</P>
<P>
A report prepared by the council, a nonprofit organization supported 
principally by the prescription-drug industry, identified some specific ways 
medications are misused, with some suggested methods of countering them. 
</P>
<P>
Young, in remarks accompanying the release of the report, noted that the 
over-the-counter drug problem is also knotty but that manufacturers of those 
medicines -- mostly for colds, fevers, rashes and stomach upsets -- are 
currently working with the FDA to make directions clearer and measurements more 
exact. 
</P>
<P>
An article in the FDA magazine, the FDA Consumer, cited a study conducted at 
the universities of Michigan and Rochester in which 3,900 medication decisions 
made by 500 mothers over a nine-month period were judged by a panel. The panel 
found that the parents did only slightly more good than harm in dosing their 
sick kids. 
</P>
<P>
One would think that prescription drugs would be more carefully administered, 
but parents are apparently no more likely to read a doctor's directions than 
they are those on the back of a box of cough drops, and instructions from 
physicians and pharmacists are not notably adequate. 
</P>
<P>
The report found that medicating mistakes centered on four major categories: 
</P>
<P>
* Stopping a medicine too soon. Grown-ups do this too. The minute they feel 
better, they stop taking the medicine. The minute the kids feel better, the 
parents stop giving the medicine. This can be a serious mistake with serious 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Take antibiotics, for example. The child feels better, and the infection 
appears to have cleared up. However, if the medicine is stopped too soon, not 
only is the child vulnerable to re-infection, but the organisms that have 
survived the first onslaught of the antibiotic will, in the best Darwinian 
tradition, likely have built up a resistance to the medicine so that the next 
infection will be much harder to stamp out. 
</P>
<P>
The specialists also cited anti-epileptic medicines, which may need to be taken 
even during seizure-free periods to prevent a recurrence of the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
* Not taking enough of a medicine. Doses may be skipped or forgotten. Medicines 
that must stay in the blood at a specific level in order to be effective -- 
medications for people with asthma, for instance -- will not work properly if 
they are not given promptly and precisely around the clock. This may mean 
waking the child up for medicine at least once a night. Any parent whose 
asthmatic child is sleeping peacefully at last simply doesn't want to wake him 
or her. (One study cited in the report found that among patients required to 
take the asthma medicine theophylline every eight hours, compliance was poor -- 
there was only 25% adherence. Compliance was much better when once-a-day doses 
were provided.) 
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that liquid medicines cause special problems. If they are 
not shaken, for example, the active ingredient may not get into the spoon. 
What's more, the measurements may be inexact. 
</P>
<P>
* Refusing to take a medicine. Studies found a variety of reasons for this -- 
including objection to the taste and bothersome side effects. 
</P>
<P>
As another factor, the report cited "a covert expression of parental 
resistance" that led to refusal of the medicine. 
</P>
<P>
* Taking too much of a medicine. The if-a-little-is-good-more-is-better school 
of dosing is a serious medical problem among adults as well as kids more 
frequently with over-the-counter medications than with prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Parents, the report found, also may be overly casual in giving children small 
portions of over-the-counter medicines prepared for adults. Children are not 
just smaller versions of adults, and sometimes adult medicines (cough and cold 
preparations, for example) are suspended in alcohol, which can be particularly 
dangerous to children. Children may react in vastly different ways than adults 
do to certain medicines. 
</P>
<P>
Parents come in for the most criticism in the report -- in not seeing to it 
that their children take the medicines properly, regularly and religiously -- 
but physicians, pharmacists and care-givers also are faulted for failing to 
talk to the children themselves and explain adequately the importance of taking 
medicines the right way. "The parents can hear, but they should be talking 
directly to the kids," noted Robert M. Bachman, executive director of the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney Wolfe, a physician and director of the Public Citizen Health Research 
Group, said a better approach would have been the printed inserts that were 
scheduled to be required in many prescription drug packages in the early 1980s 
until the regulation was killed by the Reagan Administration. The council, 
formed shortly after that action, "is an inferior replacement for a guaranteed 
automatic flow of information to the patient," Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
Bachman said the council's report did not deal specifically with the problems 
involved in testing drugs for pediatric use. "It is a complicated problem," he 
said. On the one hand, especially in drugs specifically targeted for diseases 
of children, it seems essential that there be full and appropriate testing. 
However, the ethical considerations involved in using children in research 
protocols makes such testing an especially difficult and expensive proposition. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA is wrestling with regulations that would permit testing of drugs to 
treat pediatric AIDS on children without waiting for thorough tests to be 
completed in adults. AIDS researchers have expressed concern that lives are 
being lost because of the delays caused by the current rules.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: WHAT'S MUSIC TO A RESTAURATEUR'S EARS IS AN EARACHE FOR 
HIS NEIGHBORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Shawn Hubler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are a million enchiladas in the big city, a fact that is not lost on Juan 
Guerrero. 
</P>
<P>
So a year ago, when the restaurateur opened his Old Mexico eatery in Redondo 
Beach, he cannily hedged his bet. 
</P>
<P>
Music, Guerrero and his partner figured, would be the key to their restaurant's 
success: mariachi music during the Sunday dinner hour. 
</P>
<P>
Little did Guerrero suspect that those jaunty trumpets, bright guitars and 
lilting violins would land him in the proverbial soup. This week, the City 
Council told him he would have to tone down the music or face revocation of his 
entertainment permit. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, according to Sheila Schoettger, the city's harbor director, is 
that trumpet music tends to carry. And the residents of the condominiums and 
apartments near the International Boardwalk, where Old Mexico is situated, 
complained that the revelry was carrying on far into the night. 
</P>
<P>
The entertainment that began on Sunday afternoon was still going strong at 10 
p.m., and 11 p.m. and after midnight and on through into the wee hours of 
Monday morning, Schoettger said. And the perky sounds of the house musicians 
were driving bleary-eyed neighbors from their beds. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to tell my partner, stop the music. But he was happy! What could I do?" 
Guerrero sighed. 
</P>
<P>
The music, he added, is his bread and butter. 
</P>
<P>
"Without it," he said, "no way I can pay the bills." 
</P>
<P>
The council was understanding. 
</P>
<P>
"We all love mariachi music," said Councilwoman Kay Horrell, "but those people 
down there don't enjoy it in their bedrooms at 12 and 1 o'clock in the 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
Whereupon Guerrero was warned that from now on the trumpeting would have to 
stop at 10 p.m., and take place only with his cafe's doors and windows closed.

UTILITIES POUR CONSERVATION EFFORT INTO SLOWING THE FLOW OF WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With a drought extending into a fourth year, the Los Angeles Basin's four major 
municipal utilities have emphasized saving water more than conserving power in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"We think conservation is important, and we work hard at it," said Walter Hoye, 
director of water engineering for the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power. "We are very concerned about getting that snowpack built up this 
winter." 
</P>
<P>
The department spent about $4 million last year on advertisements and 
educational materials promoting conservation and on more than 1 million 
low-flow shower heads distributed to homes. The DWP also has a program that 
requires owners of large lots to reduce the amount of water used on landscaping 
or face fines; new buildings are required to install low-flow toilets that use 
as little as half the amount of water of regular toilets. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP is the only major municipal utility in the Los Angeles Basin large 
enough to have a separate department to promote water conservation. Each of the 
three other utilities combines water and power conservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Hoye estimated that the DWP had managed to reduce water usage by about 4% as a 
result of its various programs. Although the number of water customers is on 
the rise, Hoye said, the amount of water flowing out through the city's sewers 
has leveled off. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Metropolitan Water District, the agency responsible for 
bringing in water from the Colorado River and Northern California, last year 
began providing local water agencies with financial incentives for conserving 
water. 
</P>
<P>
Through its Water Conservation Credits Program, the water district will pay the 
agencies as much as 50% of the cost of a water conservation project or $75 for 
each acre-foot of water saved, whichever is less. An acre-foot is the amount of 
water it takes to cover an acre to a depth of one foot, about 326,000 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Glendale nor Burbank has taken advantage of that program. The city of 
Pasadena recently began a program to distribute faucet aerators, low-flow 
shower heads and toilet dams to 37,000 residences. The city plans to spend 
$800,000 on the program but will receive a $325,000 rebate from the water 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Mariann Long, Pasadena's conservation director, said the program should save 
about 4,980 acre-feet of water over a five-year period. The city, which draws 
about 40% of its water from local wells, also has structured its rates to 
penalize waste: the first 100 cubic feet of water used each month costs half as 
much as any water used above that amount. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Cameron, general manager of Glendale's Public Service Department, said the 
city encourages water conservation in pamphlets sent to customers and in 
speeches and appearances by department employees. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the department is working on a water conservation ordinance that, 
in times of severe drought, would prohibit water from being used for such 
non-essential activities as hosing off sidewalks. The ordinance would also 
require customers to cut their usage. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we are getting quite involved in water conservation . . . here," 
Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
The person employed as a conservation coordinator by the Burbank Public Service 
Department has pushed water saving in special comic books and pamphlets, 
especially aimed at schools. "We've been really strong in sending the message 
out that it should be a way of life and that we should always be aware of the 
scarcity of resources," General Manager Ron Stassi said.

STUDY BACKS LIGHT RAIL FOR INGLEWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new study recommends constructing a light-rail transit line from the Westside 
through Inglewood to ease traffic congestion at the Forum, Hollywood Park and 
Los Angeles International Airport, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent and Los Angeles Councilman Robert Farrell, 
co-chairmen of the study sponsored by the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments, said Friday that such a line would provide much-needed 
transportation for commuters in Inglewood, South-Central Los Angeles, Baldwin 
Hills, Crenshaw, View Park, Windsor Hills and Hyde Park. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed line would originate at Wilshire Boulevard, running south on 
Crenshaw Boulevard to Imperial Highway. There, it would intersect with the 
Century Freeway, becoming part of a countywide mass transit system now under 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
The study, known as the Airport Southwest Area Transportation Study, was to 
make recommendations to meet transportation needs of residents living in a 
39-square-mile area, including portions of Inglewood and the city and county of 
Los Angeles. The area falls between the Santa Monica Freeway and Imperial 
Highway on the north and south and between the Harbor and San Diego freeways on 
the east and west. 
</P>
<P>
There is no money earmarked for the recommendations in the study. 
</P>
<P>
"People (in the study area) have not had their transportation needs addressed 
well by the county," Farrell said in a prepared statement. "I believe that this 
study will lay out some of the issues and concerns of the people in Southwest 
Los Angeles."

LAWNDALE REJECTS PLAN FOR FILLING COUNCIL VACANCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lawndale City Council has unanimously rejected a proposal on filling 
council vacancies that result when a council member is elected mayor, or to 
another city post. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed policy, which would have been non-binding, would have directed the 
council to fill such vacancies by appointing the runner-up in the concurrent 
council election. There are council elections every two years in April. 
</P>
<P>
City Clerk Neil Roth, who offered the idea to the council Thursday night, said 
the proposal was intended to save money by eliminating the need for a special 
election. Roth said a special election costs the city about $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, when a council seat is left vacant because a council member is 
elected to another post, the council must either appoint a new member or 
announce a special election within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
In Lawndale, the mayor's term is two years while the council and clerk's terms 
are for four years. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Larry Rudolph said the proposal was unneeded because the council 
already has the option of appointing any candidate who loses a bid for a 
council seat.

JUST ADD ELECTRICITY FOR TWINKLING ROOFTOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Replacing burned-out bulbs and stringing miles of tangled Christmas lights up 
stairways, over arches and around eaves is a holiday chore most homeowners can 
do without. But Jerry Coziahr of Coronado has taken to doing it for a living. 
</P>
<P>
Right up till Christmas Eve, Coziahr and her band of "elves" will scale tall 
ladders and string lights around trees, poles and chimneys for homeowners who 
either cannot climb ladders or detest the holiday ritual. 
</P>
<P>
Coziahr, who has multiple sclerosis, is on medical leave from teaching 
eighth-graders in the Sweetwater Union High School District until January to 
try the business. Coziahr, 42, was found to have the disease seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
After 19 years of teaching physical education and family living, she gets a 
little teary-eyed talking about the 13- and 14-year-olds she left behind. 
</P>
<P>
"Students see me at the grocery store and ask me how I am and when I'm going to 
come back to school," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But dealing with 180 students a day fatigued her so much that her doctor 
advised her to look for a different career, she said. With her business, 
Coziahr can space appointments, meeting one or two people at a time, rather 
than dealing with nearly 200 personalities a day, she said. Coziahr bought a 
Dekra-Lite franchise in September to learn tricks such as how to make lights 
stick to metal, stucco and wood. Coziahr and her 12 helpers have since 
decorated about 40 homes and businesses in Coronado, Bonita and Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Some clients are wealthy and look at holiday decorating as just another 
service, Coziahr said. Others are elderly and cannot climb ladders to put up 
lights. But, in her first season in business, most of her clients have been 
friends, she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Coziahr, a single mother of two, said she does not expect to gross more than 
$25,000 this season but hopes to increase her income each year. After school is 
out, she will contact potential clients and plan for the holidays, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to keep doing it forever," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners started calling after Thanksgiving, and installers have been 
dispatched to as many as eight homes a day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Each job takes from two to five hours, and so far she has seen nothing but 
smiles from her customers, she said. "It's really a fun business," she said. 
"It's not a service I have to push people to buy." 
</P>
<P>
The cost, which includes designing, installing and removing the Dekra-Lites, 
has ranged from $165 for lights along the roof of a small home to more than 
$1,000 for a home on a hill in Alpine whose owner wanted it lighted from all 
sides, Coziahr said. 
</P>
<P>
From a Chula Vista warehouse lined with bulbs and coils of lights in red 
baskets, Coziahr coordinates the work of the designers and installers. They 
include a college professor and a former commodities broker. 
</P>
<P>
Most people just want lights on arches and in places they cannot reach, she 
said. But design combinations, from twinkling white lights to strings shaped 
like stars and Christmas trees, are almost endless, she said. "The idea anybody 
can hang lights is true, until you look at the quality of the work," Coziahr 
said. "One lady hired us because she didn't like the way her husband put the 
lights on an outdoor tree." 
</P>
<P>
Some people add lights after she is finished, but she doesn't mind. "I'm not 
possessive about the design. I want people to be happy."

DON'T 'GET NEAR GUNS,' WARNS ONE WHO KNOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jacalyn Calabrese, 12, who was shot in the head and killed in a crowded 
shopping mall in Orange on Monday, was buried Saturday. Her 12-year-old friend, 
Juan Cardenas, who reportedly is so despondent over her death that he is 
considered a suicide risk, has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in 
connection with the shooting and is being held in Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Both youngsters, and their families, are tragic victims of a pistol, and the 
growing accessibility and use of guns by children. 
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, Juan had the .25-caliber pistol for weeks and had been 
showing it off to friends. As a joke Monday, he reportedly held it to the head 
of another girl before pointing it at Jacalyn. When he did point it at her, she 
playfully dared him to pull the trigger, witnesses recounted. The gun went off, 
killing her almost instantly. Child's play? That is too deadly a game. 
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear how Juan got the gun. And one must wonder why none of the 
youngsters who had seen the gun mentioned it to a teacher or parent. 
</P>
<P>
Police report a disturbing increase in the number of children with guns. In the 
last several months in Orange County, teen-agers have been involved in 
shootings that have killed three people and injured 10 others. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, shootings are the fourth leading cause of accidental deaths for 
children under 14. And California schools report that in the last four years, 
the number of guns confiscated from middle-school students has increased 43%. 
</P>
<P>
Adults have not seemed to instill in children an awareness of just how deadly 
guns really are. Through movies, television and games, guns may seem to be part 
of some make-believe world to 12-year-olds. But in the real world, they kill. 
Jacalyn Calabrese lost her young life to a handgun, and Juan Cardenas' life 
will never be the same, nor will the lives of either of their families, because 
of that gun. 
</P>
<P>
Guns are a menace and most people favor strict control over them. We will not 
pass judgment on the Juvenile Court case pending against Juan Cardenas. But the 
fact that a 12-year-old can get a loaded gun, walk around with it for weeks, 
show it off to friends and wave it around in a crowded shopping mall, makes a 
strong case for making it tougher for anyone to acquire a pistol. Even Juan 
knows that, now. Through his mother, who saw him in Juvenile Hall, he sadly 
warned others " . . . to know just not to get near guns." How many more lives 
must be lost and ruined before we start listening?

Is it really necessary to kill a tree just for the Christmas spirit? Now I 
realize that these trees have been raised for just this purpose, but wouldn't 
it be a lot nicer if we bought live trees and planted them after Christmas?

'SEX EDUCATION: A REASONED VIEW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I disagree with The Times editorial titled "Sex Education: A Reasoned View" 
(Dec. 15), which found the recently passed class-visitation policy of the 
Newport/Mesa School District "correct" and "reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
By insisting on three-day advance written notice for a parent to visit his or 
her child's class (and even though the wording does allow for unspecified 
exceptions), I think the school board is sending the wrong message to the 
community. All around the nation parents are asking that their schools be more 
accessible and more accountable. This new policy, far more restrictive than 
that of any neighboring school district, suggests there is something our 
schools want to hide. 
</P>
<P>
In taking this position I do not mean to condone the continued activities of 
the Committee to Restore Ethical and Traditional Education (CREATE). I do 
believe, however, that it should be acknowledged that they were the ones who 
focused public attention on the school board's lack of specific guidelines for 
the teaching of sex education. And indeed it was discovered that some topics 
were being taught that reasonable people would agree are not in the 
need-to-know category. However, these discoveries do not grant the CREATE group 
license to continue to put teachers on the defensive, or to press a further 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Specific guidelines have now been adopted by the board, albeit belatedly, with 
opportunity for the full spectrum of parental input. The trust of supportive 
parents must now be placed on school administrators to monitor curriculum and 
classrooms to ensure that those guidelines will be followed. If they're not, 
the next opportunity for recourse will be election 1991.

CREDENTIALS OF CAL STATE OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marianthi Lansdale, chairwoman of the California State University trustees, not 
only misstated her academic credentials but also demonstrated an unacceptable 
arrogance for her position on the board and to the citizens of the state. 
</P>
<P>
We do read The Times, and far more importantly, we do care. Personally, I care 
greatly that she "doesn't care," and that she apparently cannot read well 
enough to fill out application forms. If she reads poorly and doesn't care what 
her word means, well, it seems perhaps she earned her degree from a phone book. 
</P>
<P>
Political appointees traditionally are the result of contributions, in essence 
purchased, but if she is such an example of job selection then future choices 
from the phone book could hardly be worse. 
</P>
<P>
I also find disappointing the comment of CSU Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds 
because, while trustees "cannot" be held to the same standards, they certainly 
should be since they oversee the process. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti, I support her stepping 
down.

DRIVING IN THE CAR-POOL LANE WITH CHILDREN AS PASSENGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to letters by R.F. Craig and Andrea Kinney about children as 
passengers in car-pool lanes (Dec. 17): 
</P>
<P>
I disagree with their contention that I am not taking another adult driver off 
the freeway when I have only children in my car. 
</P>
<P>
I am in fact taking two adult drivers off the freeway by car-pooling my 
children and theirs to school. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that the next time they see someone with children in the car-pool lane 
they will think that just maybe that person is keeping an adult off the freeway 
by taking their children someplace they both might have driven to.

'CRITICS SAY SAT CAN BE USEFUL BUT IS OVERRATED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article "Critics Say SAT Can Be Useful but Is Overrated" (Dec. 10) sheds 
new light on the subject of the Scholastic Aptitude Test. Being a high school 
student, I feel a great amount of pressure toward this one test. I realize this 
test can significantly affect my college career and my life after college. I 
understand that this test is a way for college admission officers to evaluate a 
student's aptitude, yet I can't help feeling that this is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
How can one test evaluate several years of education? It's scary knowing the 
score you earn on this test will determine your life. Many of my schoolmates 
sometimes are more concerned with the grade they receive in a class than what 
is learned. Making the grade, sad but true, seems to be one of the highest 
priorities to any college-bound student. 
</P>
<P>
How can anyone expect students to perform well on the SAT if grades, not 
quality learning, is stressed in today's educational system?

SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE AND HOLIDAY RELIGIOUS DISPLAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial about Christmas (Dec. 17) perpetuates the myth that the 
Constitution of the United States mandates the separation of church and state. 
The idea that it does arises from an inaccurate paraphrase of the First 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
A more accurate paraphrase would be: "Do not establish an official religion and 
do permit free practice of religion." There is nothing in that paraphrase about 
separating church and state, nor is there anything in it prohibiting the state 
from engaging in ecumenical religious activity. 
</P>
<P>
Your suggestion that people should not wish other people "Merry Christmas" 
because the recipient might not be a Christian is a restriction upon the free 
exercise of his religion by the Christian and is in violation of the First 
Amendment prohibition against restricting religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
What about creches and Christmas carols? Banning them from city halls and 
schools could be construed as restricting free practice of religion; so, since 
the Constitution does not prohibit the state from participating in religious 
activity, why not? Such a practice could be made ecumenical by inviting each of 
the major religions -- Judaism, Islam, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, 
Shintoism and American Indian -- to pick one of its holidays and to sponsor 
displays and programs around that holiday. Such a policy would meet both 
requirements about religion in the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
However, if we are so bigoted that we cannot tolerate any religious expression 
connected with the state, then the painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe on a 
wall in Santa Ana's Flower Park should be sandblasted away. To allow expression 
of only one religion while banning all others is one step toward establishing 
an official religion, which is unconstitutional. However, to sandblast the 
Virgin of Guadalupe because it interferes with free expression of religion, 
would be no more constitutional than leaving it up by itself. The 
constitutional solution is to put into the same park a painting of the same 
size and visibility representing each of the religions mentioned above -- plus 
something for Protestants, the Virgin of Guadalupe belonging particularly to 
Mexican Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
What about the myth? How did it arise and take hold? Because the American 
people are no longer well-versed in the contents of the Constitution of the 
United States of America and what these contents mean. What we need is an 
intensive campaign to familiarize the American people with the contents of the 
Constitution of the United States of America, the Declaration of Independence, 
the Gettysburg Address and other similar documents and with the meaning of 
their contents.

ORANGE COUNCIL'S APPROVAL OF EASTERN DEVELOPMENT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the late '60s and early '70s, the issues of the day facing the city of 
Orange were parks and open space, density and traffic and the City Council 
attitude toward petitioners. 
</P>
<P>
Arising from these issues, the city proclaimed four-acres-per-thousand as a 
standard for local parks. The density issue was resolved in favor of lower 
densities because nothing could be done about the traffic problem. 
</P>
<P>
Two new members of the council were elected, replacing one hard-liner who was 
against parks and people and was pro-developer. The era of James Jackman, Joe 
H. Temple and Jess F. Perez was ushered in -- a kinder, gentler council. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the old terrorism returned to the council. Citizen petitioners were 
treated with disdain, disrespect and disinterest. The disinterest in open space 
and local parks returned again. 
</P>
<P>
The disinterest in the traffic and transportation problems were again evident 
when the council approved the East Orange General Plan. The council rejected 
even those few caveats the Planning Commission thought were essential, i.e. 
three-acres-per-thousand population instead of four and 5,000-square-foot lots 
instead of 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
This council went to bed with the Irvine Co. and got raped. The hills of east 
Orange will soon be bulldozed. Traffic will be at a standstill. Irretrievable 
open space will be gone. 
</P>
<P>
It's deja vu all over again (apologies to Yogi Berra). Who will be the new 
Temple, Jackman and Perez?

DRIVING IN THE CAR-POOL LANE WITH CHILDREN AS PASSENGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re children as passengers in cars: Children who go to private schools or 
preschools are in a car with one adult because the parents car-pool rather than 
have five cars go separately! 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes several adults go in one car, not to conserve car numbers on the 
highways but just to be social when they are all going out to dinner, etc., 
together. Should they also be out of the car-pool lane? 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, until the car-pool lanes are overcrowded, which I have not seen yet, 
the mothers or fathers with children should be using the car-pool lanes. At 
least it gets a couple of more cars out of the non-car-pool lanes.

Marion Butts can do without the glitter. 
</P>
<P>
He can do without prime time, flashing cash, a big splash and talkin' trash. 
</P>
<P>
He likes to keep it simple. 
</P>
<P>
"In my spare time I just go home and watch television," Butts says. "And that's 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Butts, a 6-foot-1, 248-pound rookie running back for the Chargers, is being 
careful not to get caught up in all of the commotion surrounding his recent 
success. He rushed for a season-high 176 yards in 39 carries in the Chargers' 
20-13 victory over Kansas City last Sunday. That was 10 more times than he 
carried the ball during his senior year at Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody took notice. The word is out. You'd think he was dating Donna Rice or 
something. 
</P>
<P>
People are now asking Charger Coach Dan Henning about Butts. People are asking 
each other about Butts. People are asking Butts about Butts. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Mecklenburg, All-Pro defensive end for the Denver Broncos, is saying: "I 
think he's going to be a good running back in the league for a long time. We've 
got our work cut out trying to stop him." 
</P>
<P>
Denver visits San Diego to play the Chargers today. The Broncos defense hasn't 
allowed a runner to go over 100 yards all season. "Work cut out" from a guy 
like Mecklenburg, who plays for a defense like that, is high praise. 
</P>
<P>
What's next for Butts? 
</P>
<P>
A swelled head? 
</P>
<P>
Ask Henning. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy," Henning says, "is the most unaffected pure and simple football 
player, with very little, if any, airs about what he is or what he's not. He 
likes to play football. And he isn't a guy that gets all caught up in himself." 
</P>
<P>
So when somebody approaches Butts and asks him to sign an autograph, he doesn't 
stand there thinking: "Gee, what a great guy I am." 
</P>
<P>
"You don't really think about it," he says. "You just write. Because if you let 
stuff like that go to your head, you're going to stop performing. 
</P>
<P>
"Person wants an autograph? Hey, I sign it. It don't hurt. Everybody likes 
publicity. But you can't let it swell your head, because then you'll feel 
comfortable. And you never should feel comfortable in football." 
</P>
<P>
Smart thinking for a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
Strange how so many budding stars start to feel comfortable, forgetting all 
they went through on the way to the top floor. A kid might have the same 
friends for years, and then he grows up and becomes a star in the NFL and 
doesn't associate with them anymore. Butts sees it happen. He says it won't 
happen to him. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of athletes change greatly when they become professionals," he says. 
"You're on such a high. They stop speaking to old friends. They speak to who 
they want to speak to and do what they want to do. 
</P>
<P>
"You got to realize they're only people. They're high and mighty this second. 
The next week, they can be dead broke." 
</P>
<P>
So Butts makes a point of keeping in touch with his humble beginnings. He 
frequently calls his best friend, Michael Moore, back home in Sylvester, Ga. 
Moore played with Butts at Worth County High School. 
</P>
<P>
You don't forget friends like that, friends who "stuck beside you when you had 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
"You got to stick with your friends," Butts says. "You've got to put yourself 
in your friend's situation. If a person makes it, why did he suddenly just put 
you down? It really hurts you. You say 'How could he do this to me?' We were 
friends, and now you've just plain forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
Friends remember what it was like before you were a big shot. They remember 
when you broke your leg as a junior in high school and were told you would 
never play again. They remember when you amazed everybody and came back as a 
senior, dragging enough tacklers with you to earn all-state honors. 
</P>
<P>
They remember what you went through at Florida State, where you were better 
than the incumbent fullback, but because the incumbent had already established 
himself as a starter, it was just accepted that you would do a lot of blocking 
and not a lot of talking. They remember how you dealt with that, deciding to 
ride it out because only losers run from problems, and you don't consider 
yourself a loser. 
</P>
<P>
And most of all, they remember how you used to be, and they see that you 
haven't changed. Through it all, through the high school successes, the college 
frustrations and, finally, the spotlight of the NFL, you're still the same old 
guy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's always been a pretty regular guy," Moore says. "He's always trying to 
help people out, help them make it." 
</P>
<P>
So these are the people Butts trusts. He knows they aren't just hanging around 
now because they see him on television or read about him in the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of individuals that are not really your friends, that just 
want to be around you because of your success," Butts says. "That's why you 
don't try to gain new friends, you just keep with your old friends." 
</P>
<P>
Basically, Butts has kept his simple life style even though his role as a 
football player has become much more complicated. There was a time when all 
anybody expected of him was an occasional quick burst at the goal line, plus a 
lot of reliable blocking and special teams play. Henning thought this 
seventh-round pick was a blocking back. Butts did, too. 
</P>
<P>
But Gary Anderson, because of failed contract negotiations, never showed up 
this year. So the Chargers were forced to find a replacement for his 1,119 
rushing yards, third in the AFC last season. 
</P>
<P>
The comparison is almost comical. There aren't two more different running backs 
than Anderson and Butts. Anderson is a half-inch shorter and 67 pounds lighter. 
He plays with a certain grace, makes people miss and has outstanding receiving 
skills. Butts is a meat-and-potatoes back who usually tramples over people and 
still needs work in the pass-catching department. He doesn't sneak up on you. 
</P>
<P>
Durable might be the best word to describe Butts. The best description of his 
style comes from Wayne McDuffie, Florida State's offensive coordinator. "You 
worry about him hurting other people, not other people hurting him." 
</P>
<P>
But steadily and surely, just the way he runs, Butts is changing his image as a 
one-dimensional, rock-'em-sock-'em power back. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got him in training camp, we tried to find out what his total 
capacities were," Henning says. "And obviously, they're higher than we figured. 
He's made such a great deal of improvement in his ability to run and pick holes 
that I would say if he just continues to do what he's doing, he'll get better." 
</P>
<P>
That Butts has gained 667 yards for a 4.3-yard average per carry and nine 
touchdowns is even a surprise to him. He figured he'd be doing about the same 
stuff he did at Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't really considering being the back that I am now," he says. "I 
thought, basically, that my assignment would probably be special teams. But if 
you start giving a guy the ball, and he's breaking good runs, why take him out? 
Let him keep running." 
</P>
<P>
Butts plans to keep running. Right now, he's not thinking about anything else. 
This is his time to show people he's capable of playing at this level. 
</P>
<P>
He had to fly home to Georgia two weeks ago for his mother's funeral. He 
returned in time to gain 72 yards and score a touchdown in the Chargers' 26-21 
loss to the Washington Redskins. This is football season. He will put the 
emotions of his mother's death on hold until after Sunday's game with the 
Denver Broncos, until the season is over, and he can afford to think about 
something besides football. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something you've got to put in the back of your head," Butts says. 
"There's really nothing you can do about that but just work with it in your 
spare time. Whenever you have time to deal with that situation, you do it. But 
once you're out here performing in football, you just perform to the best of 
your ability and let the other stuff come as it comes." 
</P>
<P>
So for now, Marion Butts will continue doing what he is doing, what he is 
comfortable with. He will practice. He will play. And when the football 
business is done for the day, he will go home and watch television. 
</P>
<P>
Somebody else can go to the night clubs, somebody else can go out raising up a 
storm, or raising Arizona or whatever else. It's not for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mingle around in society," he says. "I'm a social individual, but I 
don't really socialize that much, because there are a lot of individuals out 
there really looking to get an individual such as myself in trouble, introduce 
me to something that's bad. I don't go places that I think would jeopardize my 
career or my ability. I stay home. That's the best place for you."

RAMS WILL BATTLE PATRIOTS, WEATHER

<P>
The weather outside is frightful. So is the New England Patriots' season and 
that could take the sting out of the cold for the visiting Rams. 
</P>
<P>
All the way home they should be very warm. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams (10-5) probably will have a wild-card playoff berth locked up when 
they board the airplane for their return to the West Coast after today's 
regular-season finale with the Patriots (5-10). 
</P>
<P>
They might even clinch the spot before they take the field. That would happen 
if Washington were to lose at Seattle Saturday afternoon. If Washington wins, 
the Rams still can get in if they beat the Patriots or if either Green Bay, 
Minnesota or Philadelphia loses. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams may need a victory, though, to gain the home-field edge for the NFC 
wild-card game. That could be critical, considering the alternative site would 
be a cold-weather city. 
</P>
<P>
Today, game-time temperatures may not get out of the low 20s. The Patriots are 
more accustomed to that than the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"We will, I think, have to adjust to it," Ram Coach John Robinson said. "We've 
played in cold weather, played well, before. . . . You can still throw pretty 
good in the cold if the wind isn't too bad." 
</P>
<P>
"It's cold for everybody," Patriot Coach Raymond Berry said. "The big edge is 
the trip, the travel. There is a fatigue factor in those long cross-country 
trips." 
</P>
<P>
It would be more tolerable if the Rams could pack along a victory for the 
return journey. 
</P>
<P>
"Either way it's a long trip," quarterback Jim Everett said. "One might seem 
quicker than the other." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams already have covered more than two miles through the air. Everett's 
4,129 passing yards are a club record and lead the NFL. He also has a 
league-high 28 touchdown passes and is the NFL's third-rated passer. 
</P>
<P>
His big-play receivers are Henry Ellard, with 66 catches, and Flipper Anderson, 
the NFL leader with 27.1 yards per reception. He also can give the ball to Greg 
Bell, who is 73 yards short of 1,000 rushing yards and leads the league with 14 
rushing touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Patriots are coming off losses of 31-10 to Miami and 28-10 to 
Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles has won five of its last six games, Everett 
expressed concern about their defense. 
</P>
<P>
"The big factor I see is going against guys like (cornerback) Raymond Clayborn 
and their defensive squad," he said. "They're a good ballclub that has not had 
that many breaks this season." 
</P>
<P>
Clayborn and his secondary partners should be very busy against Los Angeles' 
receivers. 
</P>
<P>
"They all can run but they also have the moves," Clayborn said. "Ellard is one 
of the three or four best wide receivers in the league." 
</P>
<P>
The cold combined with the fact that the Patriots have no playoff berth to 
fight for could limit the crowd to a record low for a non-strike game at 
Sullivan Stadium, where New England moved in 1971. The current record is 
22,383. 
</P>
<P>
But the Patriots do have other reasons to play hard. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to be spoilers," running back Mosi Tatupu said. "They have something 
to go for. We have nothing except for winning the game and going home." 
</P>
<P>
There's more involved for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get to this kind of game and . . . be tense," Robinson said. "The 
Patriots might be really loose and play real well. I just don't know." 
</P>

THE 'H' IS BACK IN ERIC, GEYER IS BACK WITH SOCKERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
First, there is the matter of the name. 
</P>
<P>
If you look in an old Sockers' media guide you'll find that Erich Geyer, the 
team's newly appointed assistant coach, used to spell his name Eric. That is 
not the correct way. It is the way he figured Americans would pronounce it. 
</P>
<P>
Erich with an "H" has a soft hissing sound at the end, the way people in his 
native Germany pronounce it. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there is the nickname. 
</P>
<P>
"The Wolfman." 
</P>
<P>
Somebody was watching Geyer eat pig's knuckles in a German restaurant a few 
years back and told him he was eating like a wolf. 
</P>
<P>
Geyer said: "What are you talking about? I'm just hungry." 
</P>
<P>
The nickname stuck. The other day, Geyer was saying he never really liked it 
much. He refered to it as "That dumb nickname." Midfielder Brian Quinn, a 
teammate of Geyer's as a rookie during the 83-84 season, isn't buying that for 
a minute. He recalls the attention Geyer got from it, attention that he doesn't 
think bothered Geyer a whole lot. 
</P>
<P>
"They would write stories about him every week," Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
And remember, when he was traded back to the Sockers after a short stint with 
the Chicago Sting, he had "Wolfman" on the back of his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolfman has returned. This time, to teach. 
</P>
<P>
Socker President Ron Cady says: "There's one word I picture for Erich Geyer. 
It's not Wolfman. It's intensity. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is one thing I'd like to see us exhibit on the field it's intensity." 
</P>
<P>
That is exactly what Geyer did when he was on the field. 
</P>
<P>
A look back. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, when Geyer was 29, the coach of his second-division club in 
Germany told him he was too old to play and cut him. Not being the type to let 
one man's opinion end his career, Geyer bought a ticket to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, Socker Coach Ron Newman was told by a friend that he should 
have a look at Geyer. Newman wasn't overly enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Newman said: "I looked at Erich's resume, and nothing really 
impressed me enough to make me want to run around and get him over here. If he 
showed up, I would do the courtesy of looking at him." 
</P>
<P>
He showed up. 
</P>
<P>
But before we get to all this about Geyer actually making the team, there is 
another twist. At the time of his tryout, the Sockers were in need of a 
defensive player. Geyer had always been a forward. With players such as Juli 
Veee, Kaz Deyna and Jean Willrich around to score goals, the Sockers needed 
another guy up front like Don King needs hair spray. 
</P>
<P>
So Geyer decided it was in his best interests to tell Newman he was a defender. 
Newman laughs about that now. 
</P>
<P>
"Does he look like a forward to you?" Newman asks. 
</P>
<P>
Geyer is six feet tall and weighs just a handful of pounds less than 200. He 
probably would have been a good rugby player. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Newman gave him a chance to play in a couple of outdoor exhibition 
games and Geyer was adequate, if unspectacular. The third time out, he was 
assigned to mark Roger Davis, who was the league's leading scorer the previous 
season. He did a pretty good number on him and left him with a few reminders. A 
black mark here, a blue mark there. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was saying 'Who is that nut?,' " Geyer recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Davis even asked him what the heck he thought he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
Geyer responded with: "You do your job, I'll do mine. I need a contract." 
</P>
<P>
And so it happened. Geyer became a Socker. 
</P>
<P>
A while later, Newman was talking to the same friend who had tipped him off 
about Geyer. During the conversation, it came up that Geyer had always been a 
forward. Newman couldn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"I never knew he was a forward," Newman said. "And Erich wouldn't have said 
'Boo.' He just wanted to make the club." 
</P>
<P>
Geyer quickly became a crowd favorite. He was the first player to wave a towel 
over his head, which soon became popular with the fans. He also made a big 
splash Feb. 20, 1985 in a game against Las Vegas. Just before the game, the 
Sockers traded to get him back from the Chicago Sting and didn't tell anybody. 
He put on his uniform away from the other players and then came out waving the 
towel when his name was announced. The crowd went crazy. The Sockers won. 
</P>
<P>
Geyer was never dazzling on the field. He didn't have the footwork of Deyna or 
Veee. What he offered the defense was a certain stability. He was always 
dependable. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a blue collar player," Newman said. "You never expected anything 
exceptional from Erich, but you knew if you had to go against him it wasn't 
going to be easy." Said Quinn: "I don't think he'll ever be confused with a 
finesse player." 
</P>
<P>
Geyer isn't tip toeing into his new job, waiting until he adjusts to the 
temperature of the water. You can hear his voice echoing from every nook and 
cranny of the San Diego Sports Arena during the team's two-hour practices. 
</P>
<P>
The other day he was watching a passing and scoring drill, and suddenly he 
decided this wasn't providing the team with much of a test. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's make it more competitive," he said, situating himself in front of each 
player and making them swerve around him on the way to the goal. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of players did it wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"No, no," Geyer yelled. "Off the boards." 
</P>
<P>
This is a change from Weller, who was quiet and understated. Weller would pull 
a player aside and explain what he wanted. Geyer explains from a distance. 
Quinn says Geyer's enthusiasm might give the Sockers a boost. At 7-8, they are 
in need of one. 
</P>
<P>
"It's different," Quinn said. "We haven't had it for such a long time. It may 
rub some people the wrong way, but that's never been a problem with this club." 
</P>
<P>
Even talking casually to Geyer, the conviction of his character often emerges. 
He'll often punctuate his thoughts by shaking his fist, and he doesn't sugar 
coat his words. 
</P>
<P>
"I will talk straight out," he said. "I know most of the players. I think 
there's a mutual respect." 
</P>
<P>
As an assistant coach, Geyer is a complete package. He brings more than 
motivational skills. 
</P>
<P>
Geyer has played throughout Europe, and traveled all over the world. After 
retiring from playing in 1985 he coached the Chicago Sting for 77 games between 
1986-88. He was fired 33 games into his second season. Before accepting the job 
with the Sockers, Geyer organized a youth soccer league in La Mesa. Involvement 
in the community is important to the Sockers, who are continually trying to 
find ways to fill the stands. 
</P>
<P>
Geyer also spent a year as a Major Indoor Soccer League referee. Like most 
referees, he wasn't always well received. He got a good, old fashioned booing 
by Socker fans once for calling a foul on Steve Zungul for being too 
aggressive. Such irony. Erich Geyer penalizing someone for being too 
aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, his thought on being booed was this: "The boos are the applause of 
the referee." 
</P>
<P>
Now back in the coaching ranks, he's wearing a different hat. Aggressiveness is 
something he'd like to see more from this team, particularly in view of the 
abolition of the six-foul rule, which used to give a power play to the opponent 
after six team fouls. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the sixth foul rule," Geyer said, "you expect a certain aggressiveness 
coming up." 
</P>
<P>
So that's what he will expect from the Sockers. 
</P>
<P>
There is a side to Geyer not seen on the soccer field. Asked to describe 
himself, the words he chooses are "honest" and "open-minded." 
</P>
<P>
He might look intimidating, but Newman says otherwise. "He's a big pussy cat, 
really. I find him a nice guy, just a genuine fellow." 
</P>
<P>
Geyer was once asked to describe his off-field activities and he included 
reading, going to the beach and tending to his cactus garden. Doesn't seem to 
fit. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, his former teammate, Lorenz Hilkes, made a good point at that time. 
</P>
<P>
"He can't be the same off the field that he is on," Hilkes said. "It would be 
impossible. The police would pick him up." 
</P>
<P>
The police didn't. The Sockers did.

LEMOND IS HONORED AS SPORTSMAN OF YEAR

<P>
As terrible as 1987 was for pro cyclist Greg LeMond, 1989 has been tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond was almost killed in a hunting accident in April 1987 and still has two 
pellets lodged in the lining of his heart. Yet it took only two years for him 
to return to the top of his sport. 
</P>
<P>
He won his second Tour de France and world cycling championships. And what he 
calls "my dream year" was capped when he was named Sports Illustrated's 
Sportsman of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, 28, the only American to win the prestigious race around France, is the 
first cyclist to receive the magazine's honor in its 36-year history. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really a very simple choice made by the individual himself on that 
Sunday in Paris, when, with 15.2 miles to go in a 2,025-mile race, he not only 
beat leader Laurent Fignon, he beat him by 8 seconds," Mark Mulvoy, the SI 
managing editor who chooses the winner, told a news conference. "Everybody said 
the man did the impossible. Indeed, he did." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond said: "Every athlete in the U.S., maybe even the world, thinks Sports 
Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year is no doubt the highest award anybody can 
ever have. A year ago, if anybody had told me I was going to have a year like 
this, I would have said they were crazy. This is definitely the highliht of my 
career." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, who grew up in Reno, Nev., and now splits time between homes Kortrijk, 
Belgium, and the Minneapolis suburb of Wayzata, first won the Tour de France in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, he was fighting for his life after being accidentally shot by his 
brother-in-law while turkey hunting in California. 
</P>
<P>
"In '86, I was getting burned out from cycling," LeMond said. "It's hard to say 
it, but the accident probably prolonged my career. When it was taken away, I 
realized I didn't do it for the money, I didn't do it for anyone else except 
myself. Now I'm fine. I feel perfect." 
</P>
<P>
After recovering from the gunshot wound, he underwent an emergency appendectomy 
in July 1987. That was followed by knee and shin problems in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't in top condition early this year, which started with a 27th in the 
Tour de Trump. He followed that with a 39th in the Tour of Italy, "exploding" 
in the mountains, a term that cyclists use for losing power. 
</P>
<P>
He did give an inkling of future success when he came in second in the final 
time trial in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
In the Tour de France, LeMond took the lead following a time trial in the fifth 
stage. He lost it in the Pyrenees, regained it with another time trial and lost 
it again in the Alps. On the race's final day, he passed France's Fignon to win 
by eight seconds -- the closest finish in race history. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, LeMond won his second pro cycling title with a final sprint in 
the rain. 
</P>
<P>
He parlayed his success into the richest contract in his sport's history, a 
three-year, $5.5 million deal with France's "Z" cycling team. 
</P>
<P>
Mulvoy said other athletes considered for the award included: San Francisco 
49ers quarterback Joe Montana; Los Angeles Kings center Wayne Gretzky, who won 
it in 1982; Oakland Athletics pitcher Dave Stewart, and West German tennis 
stars Steffi Graf and Boris Becker. 
</P>
<P>
"But after I saw what Greg LeMond did that day, I knew it represented the very 
essence of sport," Mulvoy said. "I knew it would have taken something 
incredibly heroic to beat that." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's winner was Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Orel Hershiser.

CHARGERS GLAD END HAS FINALLY ARRIVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chargers have had worse seasons, the record books verify that. 
</P>
<P>
And Lord knows they've gone home at the end of the regular season plenty -- 
seven consecutive years for those who are counting. 
</P>
<P>
But a season like 1989? 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to be kidding," said Charger defensive end Lee Williams. "It was 
tough man, real tough. It was the toughest thing I've ever gone through in my 
life. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, we've probably been through every situation known to professional 
football. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of us could take another year like this one again." 
</P>
<P>
And to think, this from a guy who made All-Pro. So you can just imagine what 
all the other poor stiffs are thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to know," said James FitzPatrick, listed third on this week's 
depth chart at left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers opened the season with their third head coach in four years. Their 
season ends with the dismissal of the entire front office for the second time 
in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Today, at 1 p.m. at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, the Chargers' season 
mercifully comes to an end with a game against the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
It is one of only three NFL games scheduled this weekend that has absolutely no 
bearing on any of the remaining playoff races. The Chargers (5-10) naturally, 
were eliminated by Thanksgiving. The Broncos (11-4) have already clinched the 
home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos are favored to be in their third Super Bowl in the past four years. 
The Chargers, thanks to their incompetence, are favored to have one of top 
eight picks in the NFL draft for the sixth time since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
For the Chargers, who haven't beaten these guys since 1986, losing seven of 
their past eight games against Denver, a hint of motivation still remains. 
</P>
<P>
Says linebacker Gary Plummer: "The one good thing about finishing up with 
Kansas City and Denver is that we have a chance to make a statement. We can let 
the whole world know we're going to be contenders next season. We also got a 
new boss coming in, and guys want to make a good impression. 
</P>
<P>
"So I don't buy that crap about us not having anything to play for." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, sometime this week, Bobby Beathard will be interviewed (and many say 
hired) by Charger owner Alex Spanos for the vacancy left by Steve Ortmayer, who 
was fired Monday as director of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard already has built the Miami Dolphins and Washington Redskins into 
Super Bowl champions, but this figures to be his sternest test. Inheriting a 
team that has lost 26 of its past 37 games and molding it into a Super Bowl 
contender, some wisecracker might say, is like trying to win the Indy 500 with 
a Ford Pinto. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're not that bad, we really aren't," argues rookie defensive end Burt 
Grossman. "But I'm also a realist, and I know we don't belong in the playoffs, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell you the truth, I'm glad this season's finally over. It's been brutal." 
</P>
<P>
If you thought it was repugnant for those who played, however, you should have 
been in Gary Anderson's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, if you remember, was the guy who led the Chargers in rushing in 1988 
with 1,301 yards. He was voted by his teammates two of the past three years as 
their most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
So where was he in 1989? 
</P>
<P>
Sitting home in Tampa, Fla., relegated to watching the Chargers on TV after 
months of bitter contract negotiations with Ortmayer led only to bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope nothing good happens to that man, especially the way he treated me," 
Anderson said. "I've always said what goes around comes around, and now it 
looks like Ortmayer got his." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson says he's willing to forget all of the bad feelings now that Ortmayer 
is gone, and if the right contract is presented to him, he'll sign tomorrow and 
forgo his free-agent eligibility in February. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to play again," he said. "You can't imagine what I've been 
through. I'm so glad the season ends Sunday, because now my torture will be 
over. I can be a regular man again. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think I did the right thing, and if I had to do it over, I'd do the 
same damn thing. I'm just 28 years old. I'd like to think I still have another 
five years left. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just there's no way they should have let me sit out this season. With all 
of the close games they've played, I'd like to think I could have been the one 
to make the difference, push them over the edge." 
</P>
<P>
As it was, the Chargers have lost nine of their 10 games by a total of 39 
points. They played 12 games that were decided by a touchdown or less, and won 
just three of those games. 
</P>
<P>
"Good teams win those games, and we didn't," FitzPatrick said. "There was a 
time there that instead of playing to win, we were playing not to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the blame for those last-minute defeats was placed on the shoulders of 
quarterback Jim McMahon. He was the man who led the Chicago Bears to four 
playoff berths and a Super Bowl championship. But when he was traded to San 
Diego, he acted like a 16-year-old pimple-faced kid on his first date when it 
came down to last-minute drives. 
</P>
<P>
Henning saw enough, and in Week 13 against the New York Jets, decided to go 
with rookie Billy Joe Tolliver. 
</P>
<P>
McMahon's reaction? Who knows, he hasn't talked to the media since September. 
But, according to his agent, Steve Zucker, McMahon has had no problem with the 
demotion. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim has not complained one moment about not being in there," Zucker said. 
"It's a whole lot different than in Chicago. In Chicago, Mike Ditka took his 
job away from him, that's why Jim wanted out. 
</P>
<P>
"In San Diego, it's only natural that they want to see what Tolliver can do. 
He's a tremendously-talented quarterback. But if San Diego was 8-4 instead of 
4-8, I'm sure they would have left Jim as the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Jim had an excellent year. You've got to remember, most of the 
touchdown passes that Jim threw in Chicago were on audibles. San Diego doesn't 
call audibles, and that limits Jim's options. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows what lies ahead. Jim wants to stay in San Diego, but I don't think 
anyone can predict what the future will hold there." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that's been the Chargers' problem all along, right?

LOTTERY PICKS HAVE MADE LITTLE IMPACT IN NBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN GOLDSTEIN, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The downtrodden in the NBA may perceive the annual lottery preceding the June 
draft as a panacea that will put them on equal footing with the league's 
dominant teams. 
</P>
<P>
Dream on. The reputed college blue-chippers often show serious flaws when 
exposed to the highly physical pro game and the glut of talent. In most cases, 
it takes such players several years to reach their potential. 
</P>
<P>
These adjustment problems have been underscored by the class of 1989. With few 
exceptions, lottery picks have struggled to make an impact. 
</P>
<P>
Power forward Pervis Ellison of the Sacramento Kings, the No. 1 pick in the 
draft, can be excused. Ellison underwent foot and ankle surgery in September 
and has tendinitis in his big right toe that could sideline him until 
mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 pick Danny Ferry, chosen by the Clippers, decided to play in Italy, and 
the NBA rights to him later were traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers. No. 4 
choice Glen Rice of the Miami Heat is averaging 10.6 points but is shooting 
less than 40 percent from the field. Oklahoma All-American center Stacey King, 
chosen sixth, is averaging 5.6 points as a reserve with the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
No. 7 selection George McCloud (1.6) has been of little use to the Indiana 
Pacers, but they are off to a surprising, 13-6 start, thanks to dramatic 
improvement by veterans. Highly touted forward Randy White of Louisiana Tech, 
picked eighth by the Dallas Mavericks, has averaged 4.4 points. The Bullets' 
Tom Hammonds, the final lottery pick, also is struggling, averaging 3.4 points. 
</P>
<P>
Of the remaining lottery choices, small forward Sean Elliott, the No. 3 pick, 
has provided solid numbers (12.0) for the San Antonio Spurs, and aggressive 
forward-center J.R. Reid, chosen fifth, was averaging 13.4 points and nine 
rebounds for the Charlotte Hornets. Elliott has been part of the Spurs' 
rebirth, but the Hornets, despite Reid's strong inside play, have won only 
three of 21 games and lost 10 straight. 
</P>
<P>
Other struggling first-rounders are the Boston Celtics' Mike Smith (1.4) and 
the Chicago Bulls' B.J. Armstrong (5.7). 
</P>
<P>
Of the bottom half, the most pleasant surprises have been teen-age center Shawn 
Kemp, averaging 6.3 points for the Seattle SuperSonics, and agile 7-footer 
Vlade Divac (7.9) of Yugoslavia, a steal by the Los Angeles Lakers as the 26th 
overall pick. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the lottery, if the Bullets fail to make the playoffs, they still 
wouldn't participate in June's drawing. They traded their No. 1 pick to Dallas 
for forward Jay Vincent in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent's reputation as a player who performs only when the mood suits him is 
well-documented. He wore out his welcome in Washington and was sent to the 
Denver Nuggets in 1987 as part of the deal that landed Darrell Walker and Mark 
Alarie. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets, in turn, traded Vincent to San Antonio in January 1989. Last seen, 
he was playing for the Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
He lasted 17 games before General Manager John Nash and Coach Jim Lynam agreed 
this was a classic case of addition by subtraction. 
</P>
<P>
Lynam said, "To me, the essence is, when given the opportunity, you must seize 
it and do something with it. I think it's fair to say Vincent didn't do that. 
He reported late and never got on target. You can't guess. I have to have a 
sense what I'm going to get from my guys." 
</P>
<P>
Nash said, "The guaranteed money ($400,000) we'll have to pay Vincent is 
considerable. But we didn't think his presence was lending much in the way of a 
positive attitude to our ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
Quiz: What happened to Albert King, former All-American forward from Maryland? 
Answer follows. 
</P>
<P>
Spontaneous combustion: Philadelphia 76ers forward Charles Barkley had several 
blowups last week. The first came Dec. 12 after an 87-72 loss to the New Jersey 
Nets in which Philadelphia scored 32 second-half points. The second came when 
he was ejected from Friday's 95-88 loss to Dallas at The Spectrum after he 
allegedly spit on referee Steve Javie, who called a technical on him. 
</P>
<P>
After the Nets game, Barkley accused his teammates of gross indifference. "I 
want guys to expend energy and win some games," he said. "We're too good to 
have our record (11-10). Nobody's come to me to disagree or kick my butt about 
it. I'm easy to find. I sit in the same place for all the home games." 
</P>
<P>
But sixth man Ron Anderson rapped Barkley. "We might not have played with a lot 
of emotion against the Nets, but it wasn't that we didn't care," Anderson said. 
"Barkley played two bad games and had one good one and decides to speak out. 
Give me a break." 
</P>
<P>
Hot rumor: New York Knicks General Manager Al Bianchi is busy these days 
denying reports that he is prepared to trade playmaker Mark Jackson and 
shooting guard Gerald Wilkins to the Celtics for power forward Kevin McHale. 
</P>
<P>
"It's crazy," said Bianchi. "Can't the people who start these things be more 
responsible?" But Bianchi later added, "If this team plays well together, we 
can contend. If they don't, we might have to do something." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's agent, Don Cronson, seems convinced that his client is on the block. 
"I think there's substance to the McHale talk, and the swap for (the Clippers') 
Joe Wolf was based in fact. Bianchi wants to move Mark," Cronson said. "I think 
that's eminently clear." 
</P>

playing in Israel.

IN AND OUT OF RING, '89 WAS A BUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALLACE MATTEWS, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ring out the old, ring in the new. Some people like to look back at messy auto 
accidents and natural disasters. We here at Newsday settle for a look at the 
recent pugilistic past. In that spirit, here is a look at 1989, a year that 
will live in ennui, if not infamy, in the annals of boxing. 
</P>
<P>
January: The year starts with a thud. No major bouts except for Tyson-King 
&amp; attorneys vs. Cayton &amp; attorneys in Las Vegas. On Jan. 10, Tyson 
knocks out six packs of peppermint tic tacs and a couple of rolls of Lifesavers 
while giving a deposition. The next day, however, he is stopped cold by a young 
female attorney whom he propositions during a break in the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
February: The fighting returns to the ring Feb. 24 when Roberto Duran, ol' 
Hands of Stone, trims down his belly of mush and out-hustles Iran Barkley to 
win the World Boxing Council middleweight crown, Duran's fourth world title. 
Duran rocks Barkley early, survives a hook that spins him around in the eighth 
and drops The Blade in the 11th to edge out a split decision. The Fight of the 
Year -- sorry, it doesn't get any better than this. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Tyson returns to the ring after an eight-month absence, against 
Frank Bruno, an opponent considered an even-money bet not to last the first 
round. But last he does. Despite being floored in the first 15 seconds, Bruno 
gets up to shake Tyson with a left hook but then raises the white flag. The 
bout ends in the fifth with Bruno's back to the ropes and his eyes on the 
referee as Tyson pounds away. 
</P>
<P>
Out of this sloppy mess comes the line of the year, from Tyson: "How dare they 
challenge me with their primitive skills." Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
March: A big month that goes out like a lion -- Michael Nunn-Sumbu Kalambay -- 
and starts with a sham -- Hector Camacho-Ray Mancini. On March 6, Boom Boom and 
The Macho Man do boxing's version of the Road Runner vs. the Coyote in a bout 
appropriately promoted by Warner Bros., the cartoon factory. Camacho dances 
rings around Mancini to win a dull and unpopular split decision in Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
Five days later comes a real fight -- Evander Holyfield-Michael Dokes at 
Caesars Palace. The two heavyweights go toe-to-toe for 10 rounds until Dokes, 
depleted by years of drug abuse and inactivity, finally runs out of gas. By far 
Holyfield's toughest test, and a game enough effort by Dokes that it earned 
him, for a time, consideration as a Tyson opponent. That is, until Don King 
found he could get other, easier opponents for Tyson a lot cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
The month ends with the punch of the year -- the roundhouse left landed by Nunn 
on the jaw of Kalambay, ending their March 25 International Boxing Federation 
middleweight title bout after only 88 seconds. The cry goes up -- Nunn's not a 
runner, he's a puncher. Mirage of the year. 
</P>
<P>
April: Busy month of mostly bad fights. WBC featherweight champ Jeff Fenech 
beats Marcos Villasana in a 12-round war but retires after the bout. The 
reason? Chronic bad hands, which break at the pre-fight handshake. World Boxing 
Association welterweight champ Mark Breland stops Rafael Pineda but tears up 
his knee and undergoes surgery. Orlin Norris sleepwalks past Greg Page. IBF 
welter champ Simon Brown swats Al "Bumblebee" Long in seven. 
</P>
<P>
IBF lightweight champ Pernell Whitaker blasts out Louie Lomeli in three. 
</P>
<P>
May: By WBA decree, Mike McCallum and Herol Graham, two fighters who were 
beaten by Kalambay, somehow are picked to fight for his title, which was lifted 
when Kalambay signed to fight Nunn. McCallum wins a decision. WBC-WBA 
lightweight champ Julio Cesar Chavez wins Roger Mayweather's WBC junior 
welterweight title by TKO when Mayweather quits after round 10. 
</P>
<P>
June: Sugar Ray Leonard kisses the canvas twice, Thomas Hearns kisses his 
sister and promoter Bob Arum kisses Mike Trainer's aspirations in the wake of 
another closed-circuit blockbuster. "The War" is a draw as Leonard and Hearns 
fight 12 stirring rounds at Caesars Palace. Hearns deserves better but settles 
for the satisfaction of sprinkling Sugar on the canvas in Rounds 3 and 11 and 
surviving a furious Round 12. He also gets paid well -- $11 million to 
Leonard's $12.5 million -- but there seems little left for him in boxing. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Leonard, Arum and Trainer are plotting to do Leonard-Duran III 
-- Uno Mas -- for mucho mas dinero. 
</P>
<P>
July: Holyfield tries to upstage Tyson with a second-round KO of Brazil's 
Adilson "Maguila" Rodrigues in Tahoe, but Tyson makes a monkey out of both of 
them a week later. Tyson needs 93 seconds to stretch "The Truth," Carl 
Williams, in his second title defense of the year. That's two full seconds 
longer than it took him to ice Michael Spinks in 1988, and the outcome thrusts 
referee Randy Neumann into the spotlight for stopping the bout with Williams on 
his feet, seemingly ready to continue. So what if he was answering Neumann's 
questions in Latin? 
</P>
<P>
August: The Flying Nunn returns. Nunn flees like a butterfly and stings like a 
flea against Barkley in winning a decision on the 14th in Reno. Afterward, 
promoter Bob Arum castigates Nunn and releases him from a promotional contract. 
Sally Field sues to regain her nickname. 
</P>
<P>
September: Mismatch month: IBF junior welterweight champ Meldrick Taylor, in 
his first start after undergoing knee surgery in March, outpoints Courtney 
Hooper on the 11th in Atlantic City, N.J., and WBC welterweight champ Marlon 
Starling paints Young-Kil Chung for 12 one-sided rounds in Hartford, Conn., on 
the 15th. 
</P>
<P>
On the 20th, IBF welterweight champ Simon Brown blasts out used-up Bobby Joe 
Young in two in Rochester, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
October: The return of Terrible Tim as former heavyweight champ Witherspoon, 
now aligned with Dennis "The Menace" Rappaport, knocks out Sweden's Anders 
Eklund in one round and immediately calls for Tyson, Holyfield, George Foreman 
and a room-service menu -- not necessarily in that order. 
</P>
<P>
November: Holyfield struggles to an eighth-round KO over Alex Stewart, who 
before the bout is given as much chance as Foreman in the Miss America Pageant. 
Tyson is KO'd again, this time by a "rib inflammation" that causes his 
scheduled Nov. 18 defense against Razor Ruddock to be postponed, and then 
canceled. Tyson, who fought 32 times in his first three years as a pro, 
finishes 1989 with just two fights -- the same as Leonard and Duran, who are 10 
and 15 years his senior, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
December: The year -- and the decade -- are supposed to end with a bang when 
Duran and Leonard meet for the third time, on Pearl Harbor Day, at a new Las 
Vegas hotel called the Mirage. But the only mirage is the fight, which is a 
boring 12-round waltz won easily by Leonard, who comes into the ring wearing a 
ski cap but would be more at home in top hat, white tie and tails. Duran messes 
up Leonard's dance party with a right hand and a head butt that open two cuts 
in the 11th, but it is too late. Duran ($8 million) and Leonard ($15 million) 
cry all the way to the cashier's cage as the crowd boos. Bust of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Assessment: A poor year overall. One great fight: Duran-Barkley, some good ones 
(Holyfield-Dokes, Leonard-Hearns, Holyfield-Stewart) and no standout 
performers. A shaky Fighter of the Year vote to Holyfield, who won three fights 
but lost support among people who thought he might test Tyson. Holyfield's 
trainer, Professor George Benton, deserves Trainer of the Year for his work 
with Evander and Meldrick Taylor. Manager of the Year is John Reetz, the madman 
behind Barkley, who raised the purses of the former clubfighter to world-class 
status. Promoter of the Year goes to Camacho, for continuing to make the public 
care about him despite declining performances.

THE UPS AND DOWNS OF THE NBA; 
</P>
<P>
DID CELTICS MAKE A MISTAKE BY DRAFTING BYU'S SMITH? 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The story is a familiar one in Boston. The rookie sits. The rookie struggles. 
The rookie learns. And maybe, just maybe, the rookie will blossom before he 
wilts. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, was supposed to be the exception. The Celtics had, for 
them, a reasonably high first-round draft pick, 13th overall. They selected 
Michael Smith of Brigham Young, a deadly shooter and crafty passer whom Red 
Auerbach likened to a poor man's Larry Bird on draft day. 
</P>
<P>
Much has happened to Smith since that day in June when he became the Celtics' 
property -- and little of it is good. To rate the pick as a bust is premature 
and unfair, although there was not unanimity in the organization regarding the 
selection. But to state the Celtics feel somewhat jilted and disappointed is by 
no means understating the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed in his development," General Manager Jan Volk said. "In 
his case, it has become a problem because of his preseason." 
</P>
<P>
Smith stumbled physically and diplomatically almost from the outset. He did not 
attend rookie camp, the explanation being that he was unsigned. He reported to 
training camp unprepared for the rigors of NBA life and promptly got injured, 
missing most of that critical stretch as well as a good deal of the exhibition 
season. One ailment, shin splints, came in part because he chose that time to 
break in a new pair of sneakers. He also hurt his back, necessitating a stint 
on the injured list. 
</P>
<P>
While his two most visible assets, shooting and passing, remain intact, there 
are ongoing concerns about his attitude, his lack of speed and his ability to 
play NBA defense. Add that to the untimely injuries and the Celtics still have 
absolutely no idea if Smith will ever be an effective NBA player. All they've 
seen to date is a rookie struggling to survive who has played only 37 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that bothers me about Mike Smith -- and I liked him as a 
college player and thought he definitely would have come through for us by now 
-- is that he came to camp out of shape," said Auerbach, who led the pro-Smith 
forces on draft day. "Someone, maybe it should have been us, should have made 
sure he was in shape. If he had come to camp in great shape, I think he would 
have been able to help." 
</P>
<P>
Auerbach is willing to admit now that while Smith was his No. 1 priority on 
draft day, he would not be now. 
</P>
<P>
"The only mistake we made, and it's a simple fact. We should have taken (Vlade) 
Divac," Auerbach said. "But we didn't know he could play." 
</P>
<P>
They still don't know that about Smith, either. Of the first-round picks, only 
Danny Ferry and Anthony Cook have played fewer NBA minutes -- and they're in 
Europe. Coach Jimmy Rodgers simply doesn't have the luxury of scrutinizing the 
nuances of Smith's game with the team desperate to get untracked. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Smith sits. And even those 37 minutes are deceptive. Against Charlotte, 
for instance, he entered the game with 3.1 seconds to play. Against the Bucks, 
it was the final 28.1 seconds. Against the Lakers, it was the final 2 seconds. 
That's 3 minutes for the stat sheet, but 33.2 seconds in reality. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's proving ground has become the practice floor. And, for the first time 
in an athletic life littered with honors, distinctions and awards, he must make 
believers. It isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to give it your maximum in this league. You can't coast," Celtics 
assistant coach Chris Ford said. "He doesn't know how to push himself day in 
and day out. He doesn't know how to go full throttle. It's a reality that now 
has hit him hard. If he ever wanted to prove people wrong, now's the time. It's 
up to him. He has to gain the respect'and admiration of his teammates and 
there's no easy way of doing that." 
</P>
<P>
Both Ford and Rodgers say Smith is progressing. But with Bird and Reggie Lewis 
sharing the small forward position, there simply is no time available for the 
rookie unless an injury intervenes or a blowout materializes. So far, the 
Celtics have had little of either. 
</P>
<P>
Smith knows he is the target of verbal slings and arrows (talk show callers are 
on his case) and a writer from Utah informed him Wednesday that the word around 
BYU was the Cougars think they are better off now that he's gone. He offered no 
alibis. 
</P>
<P>
"I could see people doing that (trashing him). People are entitled to their own 
opinion," he said. "If you're in this league, there isn't much you can do about 
that. So be it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his playing time, Smith said, "I set a goal for myself this year to 
play 10 minutes a game. That's what I wanted. But I'm realistic enough to know 
who I'm playing behind. 
</P>
<P>
"I was given a chance and that way, it is frustrating. I'm rolling with the 
punches and trying to prepare to stay mentally and physically ready." 
</P>
<P>
Is there hope for Smith? Or did the Celtics make a monumental goof? The normal 
probation period for a rookie is three years, although the ones who pan out 
generally show signs of promise in the first season. Volk said the team still 
has high expectations for Smith, not to mention a guaranteed $2.25 million 
investment through 1993. Rodgers said, "the opportunity is going to be there 
somewhere along the line, but I can't tell you when that will be." 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics didn't select Smith out of a vacuum. The teams who picked 14th and 
15th, Golden State and Denver, also had Smith on their dance cards. Orlando, 
which picked 11th, wasn't interested while the Nets, who picked 12th, wanted a 
playmaker and got Mookie Blaylock. 
</P>
<P>
"We interviewed him during the playoffs," Warriors assistant Garry St. Jean 
said. "There were some in our organization who liked him and some who weren't 
so high on his game. We weren't 100 percent either way. But (Tim) Hardaway was 
our guy and we're glad we got him." 
</P>
<P>
Another team that talked to Smith was Denver. The Nuggets took Todd Lichti, 
whom they rated higher than Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Babcock, the Nuggets' vice president for basketball operations, cautioned 
against judging anyone after 24 games, noting that Blair Rasmussen played the 
fewest minutes of any No. 1 pick in 1985-86. Rasmussen now is averaging 14 
points and 8.6 rebounds and just signed a seven-year, $17.5 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
"We put Mike through a number of tests and he tested out well," Babcock said. 
"We liked his shooting and passing ability. The only thing we saw as a downside 
was his defensive intensity and capabilities. We talked to him at length about 
how much he was willing to work. But it was more of a question rather than a 
negative. We were concerned. In college, he didn't spend a lot of time working 
on his defensive skills. And you've got to play defense to play for Doug 
(Moe)." 
</P>
<P>
In basketball, there's a word for lack of defensive intensity: soft. Auerbach 
has heard the term applied to Smith and dismissed it. Or did he? 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely not soft," Auerbach said. "They said the same thing about 
Detlef Schrempf. They played soft in college but guys learn to adapt and adjust 
when they get to the pros. He (Smith) is one of them. He could adjust to that. 
I don't see it as a problem."

MARSHALL LAW: MAKE MOST OF BAD SITUATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The system is stacked against defensive end Leonard Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
In the New York Giants defense, Marshall must read and then react. He can't 
gamble when he rushes the quarterback because he has containment 
responsibilities. He must stick to the plan because if he doesn't it will have 
repercussions elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
It's a scheme that makes the defensive linemen plug gaps and makes linebackers 
look like stars. John Madden has called Marshall the best two-gap defensive end 
in the NFL, but you don't make the Pro Bowl as a set-up man. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall is having his best year since the 1986 Super Bowl season and so are 
the Giants (11-4), who can wrap up the NFC East with a victory over the Raiders 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall has 9 1/2 sacks, 56 tackles (6 1/2 for losses) and has pressured the 
quarterback a team-high 89 times. But the Pro Bowl recognition went to the 
player who lines up outside Marshall's right shoulder, Lawrence Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"Leonard has had a great year," Taylor said. "But when you vote for the Pro 
Bowl you have a lot of names in front of you. A lot of times players just call 
out the names they've heard before." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's name has been called as often as any player in league history. If he 
plays in the Pro Bowl Feb. 4 it will be his record-tying ninth consecutive 
appearance in the postseason all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and Marshall have occupied the right side of the Giants front seven 
since 1984. It has been a mutually beneficial relationship. Each diverts some 
of the opponents' attention from the other. 
</P>
<P>
But it's Taylor's name that ends up on the marquee. He performs the spectacular 
stunts while Marshall and Carl Banks play it straight. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be a little more conservative as a player, so it's very difficult 
to get sacks and make big plays in this defense," Marshall said. "You think 
about it, but can't really let it affect the way you play. You have to continue 
to work hard. 
</P>
<P>
"People will recognize you. You know who has played well and who deserves to be 
in that spot. That's all that matters." 
</P>
<P>
Because they have to plot ways to control him, opposing coaches recognize the 
contribution Marshall makes. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this season the Redskins, Cowboys and Chargers tried to avoid Marshall 
and Taylor by directing their offense to the other side. The Chargers used a 
seven-man line and often double-teamed Taylor and Marshall. They were 
contained, but the Chargers offense sputtered and the Giants won the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The most unsung guy on the Giants is lined up right next to Taylor," San Diego 
Coach Dan Henning said. "I think Marshall is as good a right defensive end as 
you're gonna see anywhere. Some people are great pass rushers and some are good 
run defenders. This guy is one of those people who falls in the category of 
being probably one of the top four guys at his position in doing both things. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been next to Lawrence all this time and he's in the position of doing 
more of the grit work. But if you overemphasize LT you are going to have your 
hands full with Marshall." 
</P>
<P>
Once left end Eric Dorsey was sidelined in the second game with a broken bone 
in his right foot, offense's were able to concentrate even more on Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants have gotten hardly any pressure from the left side all season. 
Occasionally Taylor is switched to that side, but no permanent solution has 
been found. When Taylor hurt his ankle against San Francisco, Marshall was the 
only legitimate pass rusher left. 
</P>
<P>
Even so Marshall has had some big games rushing the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
He beat Minnesota's Pro Bowl tackle Gary Zimmerman for two sacks and pressured 
the quarterback four other times. His second sack against Seattle forced Kelly 
Stouffer to fumble and led to a safety. Against Denver he pressured John Elway 
10 times, sacked him once and drew two holding penalties against Gerald Perry 
(one wiped out a 50-yard gain by Bobby Humphrey). 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Marshall may be lined up against the Raiders' second string tackle, 
Steve Wright. Starter Rory Graves is listed as doubtful because of a foot 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't count on it, but you notice (those things)," Marshall said. "Like 
the week before I noticed Gerald Perry was apt to get holding penalties. 
</P>
<P>
"So you go into the game and work hard and keep pressure on the guy. You try to 
make it tough and if you do those things you get a lot of satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall hasn't received postseason recognition since he was a Pro Bowler in 
1985 and 86. It's not just a coincidence that those were the two seasons when 
Marshall posted his best sack totals. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the four starting defensive ends in the Pro Bowl are among the top 
three in their conference in sacks. Of the six ends named to Pro Bowl, only 
one, Bruce Smith of Buffalo, played in a 3-4 defense. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is I've played well and I had a great year. I'm not 
disappointed," Marshall said. "We have a shot to win the division this weekend 
and we'll see what happens after that."

ALLEN PUTS LONG BEACH IN SPOTLIGHT WHILE STILL 0-0; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: NEW COACH GEORGE ALLEN BRINGS A RECORD OF SUCCESS, FAME AND 
CONTROVERSY WITH HIM TO CAL STATE LONG BEACH. THE UNIVERSITY EXPECTS HIM TO 
SCORE ON THE FUND-RAISING CIRCUIT AS WELL AS ON THE GRIDIRON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
George Allen, the new football coach at Cal State Long Beach, stood at the dais 
in a conference room of the Airport Marriott Hotel earlier this week, a brown 
school cap covering shocks of black hair, a 49er jersey in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
He grinned at the media and waved to friends and former players who had come to 
wish him well in a job that he called "the toughest in America" -- rebuilding a 
university football program that was on the verge of extinction three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
But University President Curtis McCray and Athletic Director Corey Johnson made 
it clear that they were hiring the highly successful former National Football 
League coach to do more than win games. They also expect the 71-year-old 
physical fitness fanatic to give the university a significant financial boost. 
</P>
<P>
"This wasn't purely a football hire," McCray said later during an interview. 
"Football is the focus, but I expect (Allen) to do more." 
</P>
<P>
As part of his three-year, $100,000 a year deal, Allen has pledged help in 
raising funds for the school's athletic foundation, which will pay $34,000 of 
his salary. 
</P>
<P>
"He has close contacts," McCray said. "We think he can draw the attention and 
resources we need." 
</P>
<P>
Recent revelations that his nonprofit National Fitness Foundation may lose its 
tax-exempt status and allegations that the organization has spent nearly all of 
the $2.7 million it raised to cover its costs may weigh on the University's 
decision down the line. But by using his prestige and personal charisma now to 
encourage major donors to contribute "private endowments" to the university, 
McCray said, Allen should be able to raise at least $1 million by the end of 
his second football season. "I expect that he and I will be on the road 
together," McCray said. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's hiring seemed to be in line with McCray's goal -- announced when he 
took office two years ago -- of making non-academic campus programs financially 
self-sustaining. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Allen's reputation as a winner also was a factor in the decision. 
The 49ers were 11-24 in the past three years, which prompted the resignation of 
Coach Larry Reisbig in November. The team was beaten 52-0 by Big West 
Conference champion Fresno State, 63-10 by Hawaii and 52-10 by Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
In 12 seasons in the NFL as coach of the Los Angeles Rams and the Washington 
Redskins, Allen had a record of 120-47-5, the third-best winning percentage in 
league history. He rebuilt both teams quickly. The Ram franchise was 51-87-5 
before him, 49-19-4 in five seasons with him. He was voted NFL Coach of the 
Year four times. He led the 1972 Redskins to the Super Bowl, where they lost to 
Miami, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, wearing his National Football Conference championship ring from that 
Super Bowl team, admitted Tuesday that he will need all of those skills to help 
the 49ers. He said he took the job because it was a challenge and because it 
was close to his Palos Verdes Estates home. He said he would help raise money 
to build an on-campus football stadium, solicit more support from alumni and 
get students on campus more enthused about football. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he intended to raise the budget of the campus sports information 
director to handle the increased media attention the school expects to receive 
with Allen as its coach. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach, which plays a Division I schedule, shares antiquated Veterans 
Stadium in northeast Long Beach with Long Beach City College and local high 
schools, which have preference on dates and times for its use. The facility has 
seats on only one side, which makes scheduling TV games there unattractive, 
thereby costing the university much-needed broadcast royalties. 
</P>
<P>
The university's football program has held a tenuous spot in the community 
since 1986 when former university President Stephen Horn incurred the wrath of 
boosters by attempting to dismantle it. After drawing severe criticism, Horn 
changed his mind and challenged the residents of the city of Long Beach to 
raise $300,000 or lose a football team. A fund-raising drive was successful and 
since then Horn has consistently described himself as a strong supporter of 
athletic programs. 
</P>
<P>
More than $315,000 was raised, but the program's morale sank. First the 
football coach, then the athletic director left for other jobs. Game attendance 
dwindled to an average of 2,650 fans for four home games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Horn, who is now a member of the faculty, praised Allen's selection. "I'm 
simply delighted," he said. "Anyone with (Allen's) background and personality 
will have a good leg up on funding. A vibrant athletic program obviously helps 
the university and the community. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's an excellent move. (Allen's) reputation and credibility will 
provide the excitement that people want to see.' 
</P>
<P>
Allen's hiring comes at a time when McCray has made cuts elsewhere on campus, 
particularly at campus radio station KLON and in the arts. That didn't, 
however, seem to rankle Rick Lewis, KLON's general manager, who expressed 
support for Allen's hiring on the grounds that it will help make football 
self-sustaining and thus help everyone on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect it will make more people attend," said Lewis, whose radio station 
suffered a 9% cut in its budget last year. "There's no jealousy. In general I 
think it's good to make a program as good as you can make it." 
</P>
<P>
However, some Allen-bashing has surfaced in the media since his appointment 
last Tuesday. He is known for attending to some of the smallest details when he 
is on the football field, like the time he became obsessed with the number of 
empty water cups dropped by Ram players on the field during summer practice in 
1978. Allen made such a big deal about it, the incident is reported to have led 
to his firing just two games into the Rams' preseason schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Yet strangely, while Allen has been known to become preoccupied with details on 
the field, he left many of the details of his contract at Long Beach to others. 
By his own admission, he did not research the position as thoroughly as he 
would have liked to. For instance: 
</P>
<P>
He said he could not remember the length of his contract, although he said he 
thought it was for three years (The Washington Post reported that it was for 
five. No one at the school was available to confirm its length, but one Long 
Beach official said he thought it was only three). 
</P>
<P>
Allen also said he couldn't remember his salary with the 49ers, but added, "I'd 
make more money in two weeks (speaking somewhere)." 
</P>
<P>
Allen insisted that he be provided with a car and driver to shuttle him to and 
from his home and the 49er campus, a distance of about 20 miles. In fact, at 
one point in the negotiations Allen turned the job down because the university 
balked at his request. Allen since thinks he won on the transportation issue. 
He accepted the job late in the evening last Monday night after he had told The 
Times that afternoon that he was turning the school down. However, at Tuesday's 
press conference McCray said that if 49er boosters wanted to provide Allen with 
a car and driver, that was fine, but the university would not pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Allen said he had not met with the seven assistant coaches being retained by 
the school. He says he has two men, "one in the NFL right now" that he wants to 
add. The school will allow him two hires, but Allen wasn't sure what the jobs 
paid, or if that would be enough to encourage anyone he knows to join him. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he had not visited the school's playing field. "The last time I 
was at Veterans Stadium was in 1966," he said. "Has it changed much?" 
</P>
<P>
As for building a winner, Allen said: "You say 'what is realistic' to me and 
you mention 5-5. That doesn't sound good to me. . . . Here it might be a heck 
of a season." 
</P>
<P>
Allen also has a reputation as as a spendthrift. His NFL coaching career ended 
when he was fired from the Redskins job by then owner Edward Bennett Williams 
in 1977. "He was given an unlimited budget and he exceeded it," Williams said 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Is there the possibility Allen will make the same mistake at Long Beach? 
</P>
<P>
"You can't spend what you don't have," said Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Late last week, however, reporters from The Times asked Allen to explain why 
his National Fitness Foundation had failed to file the proper papers with the 
State of California, thereby threatening its tax-exempt status and risking 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
Allen's reply: "That's news to me." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Visser, assistant coach with the 49ers for 11 years, still had not been 
introduced to Allen as he waited for his new boss to exit a TV interview in an 
adjoining room following Tuesday's press conference. He had come as "a 
liaison," for himself and the six remaining full-time coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I think George understands the (financial) limitations that Long Beach has, 
and he has taken on the challenge the way it is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And Allen drew support from other 49er supporters. Bernie Jones, president of 
the 49er Athletic Foundation, said he was delighted to have Allen in town. He 
said he expects the Foundation to move on one of Allen's priorities, upgrading 
the campus weight room. Jones said he feels his organization, an independent 
booster group, can raise $1 million next year. Much of it in all likelihood 
will go to Allen for the football program. 
</P>
<P>
Said Visser: "It's time to get on with (the business of) football." 
</P>
<P>
At the press conference Tuesday, Allen, a grandfatherly figure, seemed at home 
with the flashing strobes from cameras and bright television lights. The 
impression he gave was one of himself about to have some fun. He recognized 
some of his former players, Washington Redskins defensive back Jeff Severson, a 
graduate of Cal State Long Beach, and Rams running back Dick Bass. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no miracle worker," he told them, and the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
After 15 minutes of questioning he beckoned the crowd of reporters and 
well-wishers to "give three big hip, hip, hoorays" for the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
It will take more than cheerleading to help the 49er football program, yet 
McCray and Johnson, like boys with a new toy, joined in to lead a rousing yell.

Billy Hunter of Westlake High won his third most-valuable-wrestler award in as 
many tournaments Saturday, helping the Warriors to a second-place finish behind 
Channel Islands in the Gold Coast Classic at Oxnard High. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, second in the state in the 165-pound division last year, pinned his 
three opponents to win the 175-pound division and extend his record to 13-0. 
Hunter was named the most valuable wrestler in the upper weights, an award he 
also won at tournaments in Rosemead and Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
Three Marmonte League teams were among the first four finishers. Channel 
Islands won with 175 1/2 points and Westlake had 139. Royal was fourth with 94 
1/2 points. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake's Farzin Daneshnia (112), Neal Mason (154), and David Schumm (191) won 
their weight classes and remained unbeaten. Daneshnia pinned two of three 
opponents and lifted his record to 14-0. Schumm and Mason each recorded two 
falls, improving their records to 13-0 and 14-0. JEFF RILEY

FIREFIGHTERS FACE THEIR BIGGEST CHALLENGE; 
</P>
<P>
MOBILIZATION: CREWS STRAIN TO CONTROL FIVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF BLAZES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Marshaling engines and manpower from across the county, the Los Angeles Fire 
Department found itself battling not just a high-rise fire early Saturday but 
at least five different kinds of wind-scattered fires that skipped and jumped 
across the upscale Westside neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The daunting task strained city Fire Department resources to the limit, forcing 
quick decisions over where to start and how to deploy what officials called the 
largest firefighting force mobilized for a building fire in Los Angeles 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"This made the First Interstate look like a dumpster fire," said Firefighter 
Larry Horner, referring to last year's inferno in what was, at the time, 
downtown's tallest skyscraper. 
</P>
<P>
Even as firetrucks rolled into the Wilshire Corridor after the first alarm at 
3:37 a.m., the men and women assigned to the task knew they had a fire like no 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Flames that started at the construction site of a fancy condominium complex 
were swiftly engulfing floors of the 14-story Wilshire Terrace apartment 
building next door, and glowing embers were spraying southward across Wilshire 
Boulevard like a Fourth of July sparkler. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, refugees -- clad in everything from bathrobes and slippers to hastily 
grabbed mink coats and jewels -- were filling the streets. They watched in 
shock and disbelief as their homes burned. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first arriving companies, it was looking like a war zone," said Fire 
Chief Donald O. Manning. "It was a lot more than we could handle very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Manning said more than 400 firefighters from about 80 companies joined the 
effort, with additional units on call from the county and the cities of Beverly 
Hills, Santa Monica and Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
At least seven firefighters suffered minor burns or heat and smoke-related 
injuries, including three who were burned on the face and hands. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to fires at the high-rise and construction site, Manning said, Fire 
Department companies had to tackle blazes in a "low-rise" three-story apartment 
building, single-family homes and triplexes. 
</P>
<P>
In all, firefighters attacked blazes at 13 buildings and two construction 
sites. Some properties were vacant; others required evacuation of dozens of 
people. Each posed a different challenge and different problems, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said Wilshire Terrace received the most attention in part 
because it represented the greatest potential disaster, had the building not 
been safely evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
Tired and covered with soot, firefighters from as far away as San Pedro, the 
San Fernando Valley and Echo Park rested late Saturday morning outside the 
Wilshire Terrace and recalled what they said was an arduous battle to chase the 
fire as it spread upward from floor to floor. 
</P>
<P>
Although the temperature inside the burning Wilshire Terrace apartments was 
estimated at 600 degrees, firefighters in protective clothing were able to 
combat the fire from the inside out, the most effective approach in battling 
building fires, authorities said. The firefighters moved from apartment to 
apartment, broke down doors and, with hoses hooked up in the stairwell, "pushed 
the fire out the window," said Capt. Lane Kemper. 
</P>
<P>
The leather shield that says LAFD on several firefighters' helmets had been 
melted by the heat. 
</P>
<P>
"It was mass confusion up there," said ladder operator Dane Jackson, who like 
many of his colleagues was working a double shift. "Hose lines everywhere, men 
everywhere. It was real clogged up. Very tough." 
</P>
<P>
The men in his company, Jackson said, went through four or five 20-minute air 
bottles apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The concrete and steel construction of the building helped in slowing the 
fire's pace and allowed time for crews to set up on each floor, Deputy Fire 
Chief Craig Drummond said. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, it would have gone up like a lumber pile," Drummond said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the mammoth effort of the Fire Department, several residents in damaged 
houses and buildings other than Wilshire Terrace complained that engine 
companies were too slow in responding and seemed to be poorly deployed. In one 
case, a house went up in flames after a fire company had come and gone. 
</P>
<P>
They also questioned the decision of the 104-station Los Angeles Fire 
Department to rely on its massive but far-flung resources instead of enlisting 
the aid of closer departments such as Beverly Hills, whose main fire house is 
only a few minutes from the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Some Los Angeles city fire engines arrived more than an hour after the first 
alarm. Battalion Chief Mike Littleton said his South-Central-based unit arrived 
about 5 a.m. -- "and there was still lots of fire." 
</P>
<P>
Inspector Ed Reed, a city fire spokesman, said the department's strategy may 
have been different "if this was on the border" between Los Angeles and Beverly 
Hills. "We don't have an arbitrary system where we'll deplete Beverly Hills to 
fight our fire. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are on-the-spot, emergency decisions that are made," Reed said. "Trying 
to second-guess those decisions is very, very difficult." Asked whether the 
operation at such major fires is chaotic, Reed said "of course." 
</P>
<P>
Only three blocks south of the Wilshire blaze, a house on Holmby Avenue was 
destroyed, another was extensively damaged and a third had minor roof damage. 
Several residents complained that firefighters were slow in responding to calls 
to 911 and even personal pleas for help. 
</P>
<P>
A few blocks south on Kinnard Street, Al and Elizabeth Javor saw their house go 
up in flames after a visit by firefighters. After a small fire started on their 
roof, the Javors turned a hose on the roof and an engine company arrived to 
finish the job. Firefighters punched a few holes into the cedar shingle roof 
and got at hot spots with a fire extinguisher. 
</P>
<P>
"They were here about 10 minutes," recalled the Javors' son, Les, visiting for 
Christmas. "When they left they said, 'Keep an eye out.' That's all they said." 
</P>
<P>
More than an hour later, Elizabeth Javor was watching as the roof suddenly 
caught fire and spread rapidly, destroying the roof and ceiling. Said Les 
Javor, "They must have missed a spot." 
</P>
<P>
Elden and Janet Fox, both prosecutors in the Los Angeles district attorney's 
office, estimated that firetrucks arrived more than 30 minutes after their 
call. Like many residents south of Wilshire, they squirted garden hoses on 
their neighbors' homes while fire engines focused on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Later Saturday, many residents who had been evacuated from Wilshire Terrace 
milled about until they were allowed to re-enter the building to recover some 
of their property. 
</P>
<P>
This came as good news to Charles Jawetz, an elderly resident who, like so 
many, had fled with due haste. 
</P>
<P>
"I grabbed this hat that I haven't had on for five years and a warm coat," he 
said, "and forgot my pants." 
</P>
<P>

PLAYING IN COURT, AN INSIDE LOOK AT AN EDDIE MURPHY MOVIE DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a trial that alternately resembles a sitcom and a primer on Hollywood 
back-stabbing and big-buck negotiations, the trial of Art Buchwald vs. 
Paramount Pictures Corp. gave onlookers a glimpse last week into the "creative 
process" that brings stars like Eddie Murphy to the neighborhood bijou. 
</P>
<P>
From quips by talk show host Arsenio Hall ("I'm kind of an only child. I have a 
brother in a coma.") to humorist Art Buchwald ("An East German guy says, 'What 
business should I go into?' and an American capitalist guy tells him to get 
into the S&amp;L business . . . but he has to get five senators to help him."), 
the laughs just kept coming at the start of Buchwald's $5-million 
breach-of-contract action against the film studio. 
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and film producer Alain 
("Buddy, Buddy," "Racing With the Moon") Bernheim have accused Paramount of 
stealing Buchwald's 1982 story about an African king left stranded in 
Washington to use as the basis of the 1988 Eddie Murphy hit "Coming to 
America." Hall, Murphy and Murphy's manager, Robert Wachs, all maintain that 
Murphy never even saw Buchwald's story, "King for a Day," let alone plagiarized 
it. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't need to, said Hall, a Murphy sidekick. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, when Murphy had just had back-to-back hits in "48 HRS." and "Trading 
Places," the comedian could "break wind and they'd make it into a movie," Hall 
boasted in a deposition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just to say that Eddie's so talented," Hall tried explaining during his 
turn on the witness stand. "It's kind of a joke . . . a compliment to his 
talent." 
</P>
<P>
But later in the week, when a parade of high-ranking movie industry executives 
began taking the witness stand, a darker and more sobering drama of Hollywood 
unfolded as details emerged on just how a movie is molded for a star. 
</P>
<P>
Former Paramount production chief Ned Tanen confirmed in his testimony that 
Murphy earned an $8-million salary for his role in "Coming to America" while 
the combined salaries of the rest of the cast came to $906,000. 
</P>
<P>
"Eddie Murphy is a major, major star," Tanen explained. "He gets what the 
market will bear and this ($8 million) is what the market will bear." 
</P>
<P>
On top of his acting fee, Murphy also gets 15 cents of every dollar that 
Paramount earns on "Coming to America" -- a contractual deal known in Hollywood 
jargon as "pure" gross profit participation. Since "Coming to America," Murphy 
has boosted his acting fee to $9 million per picture plus 15% of the gross 
profit, and he is still unhappy with his current five-movie deal with 
Paramount, according to exhibits and testimony entered into the court record. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, neither Buchwald nor Bernheim would have made any money on their 
own profit participation agreement with Paramount if it had been in force 
during the making of "Coming to America." According to the agreement, they were 
to have received 19% of the net proceeds from any movie made from Buchwald's 
story "King for a Day." 
</P>
<P>
But, despite the film's blockbuster status, its gross take of more than $300 
million still has resulted in no net profit, and may never do so. 
</P>
<P>
"My view was it was a very tough film to get to net profits," Tanen testified. 
</P>
<P>
Those with the clout to negotiate for a part of gross profits -- that is, the 
actual ticket revenue that comes back from theaters to the studio before 
expenses -- get their share before anyone else. As a result, box office hits 
like "Coming to America" can and do remain money losers on paper for years. 
</P>
<P>
The gross vs. net lesson was one of the first that Murphy learned when he came 
to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
After the success of "48 HRS.," Tanen and several other Paramount executives 
threw a dinner party at Ma Maison restaurant in 1984 for Murphy to give him "a 
gift" of a "couple of net profit (percentage) points" from that film, Wachs 
testified. The chief reason for the dinner, however, was to pitch Murphy on a 
dozen more Paramount projects to get him to commit to even more movies. One of 
those projects was Buchwald's "King for a Day." 
</P>
<P>
According to Touchstone Pictures President David Kirkpatrick, then a Paramount 
film development executive, Murphy went into a bored trance in which he assumed 
a "glazed-over" expression, showing his disinterest in the projects. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy soon learned how worthless Paramount's "gift" of net profit points 
really was. In his deposition, the actor called net profits "monkey points" and 
said only fools would accept net points in their contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Buchwald's story was developed into three different scripts for Paramount, 
first under the working title "It's a Crude, Crude World" and, later, "King for 
a Day." 
</P>
<P>
At one point in 1984, Kirkpatrick testified, he urged Bernheim and screenwriter 
Francis Veber to have lunch with child actor Emmanuel ("Webster") Lewis and his 
mother in the Paramount commissary. Lewis, who sat on telephone books to be 
able to participate in the discussion, had a part written into "King for a Day" 
because Murphy had allegedly met him on an airplane once, liked him and wanted 
him to be in his movie, according to Kirkpatrick and Bernheim. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said in his deposition that he never knew anything about Lewis wanting 
to be in his movie and that Paramount executives probably just wanted to 
exploit the box office potential of the next Eddie Murphy movie by pairing 
"Webster" with him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Paramount's show, you know," Murphy said of the "Webster" sitcom. " 
'They're both on the lot. They're both black. We can make all this money.' 
That's probably what happened, you know." 
</P>
<P>
Wachs, an attorney and former New York comedy club owner who helped discover 
Murphy in the late 1970s, testified that he hated "King for a Day" and the 
scripts that Paramount spent $500,000 developing. By 1985, "King for a Day" was 
off the Paramount lot as an Eddie Murphy project. 
</P>
<P>
The next year, Bernheim took it to Warner Bros., where another $250,000 was 
spent working up a new screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
But in the meantime, Murphy and Hall came up with what they said was their own 
original idea for a screenplay: a black fairy tale about an African prince who 
comes to New York in search of a queen. This story, originally titled "The 
Quest," was developed into "Coming to America" by David Sheffield and Barry 
Blaustein, a pair of screenwriters Murphy met during his stint on "Saturday 
Night Live" in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Sheffield and Blaustein received screen writing credit. Murphy was given story 
credit. Hall did not receive credit for his part in developing the story, 
according to testimony, though he outlined several scenes on the witness stand 
that he said he came up with during story conferences. 
</P>
<P>
If there was a link between "The Quest" and Buchwald's story about a black 
African king who comes to Washington, winds up in the ghetto, has a series of 
misadventures and returns to his native land with his American bride, 
Paramount's hierarchy from 1983 to 1985 either didn't know about it or forgot 
about it, according to testimony of the executives. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Paramount Pictures Chairman Frank Mancuso nor former Paramount 
production chief (now Walt Disney President) Jeffrey Katzenberg could remember 
"King for a Day" specifically being developed for Murphy or Murphy giving his 
approval to the project. A sheaf of Paramount interoffice memos, however, were 
entered into evidence in the case which indicate that it was, indeed, being 
molded for Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1987, Bernheim had lunch with Tanen in the same Paramount 
commissary where he and screenwriter Veber huddled with Emmanuel Lewis and his 
mother three years earlier. In what Bernheim described as a shouting match and 
Tanen described as "raised voices," the producer protested that Murphy, 
Paramount and Tanen had stolen Buchwald's story idea. Though Tanen testified 
that he and Bernheim remain friendly and that Tanen has great respect for the 
French-born producer, neither of them have spoken to each other until the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
When Warner Bros. production head Bruce Berman heard about "The Quest" in 
January, 1988, he dropped the Buchwald-Bernheim project, Berman testified. 
</P>
<P>
And later that year, when "Coming to America" came to Martha's Vineyard in 
Massachusetts where Buchwald was vacationing, the columnist saw the movie and 
agreed with Bernheim that they should sue Paramount for breach of contract. 
When Buchwald told his friend, Paramount Communications Inc. Chairman Martin 
Davis, of his intentions, Davis sent him a bottle of Champagne and a record 
titled "Sue Me." 
</P>
<P>
So, in November, 1988, he did. He went on Larry King's national radio show the 
same week and blasted "Coming to America" as a badly made and poorly executed 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom last week, Buchwald said he might write a book about 
"Buchwald vs. Paramount." He sarcastically hinted he might even eventually turn 
the "Buchwald vs. Paramount" book into a movie. 
</P>
<P>
As every Hollywood veteran knows, a movie needs an exit line if it's going to 
be memorable. Tanen may have supplied it in his final quip for the court 
record: 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone's in two businesses: their own and the movie business."

THIEVES SWIPING WHOLE SHIPMENTS OF IMPORTED GOODS SENT TO L.A. PORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
One Monday in October, Greg Smith arrived at work to find his Freddie Krueger 
dolls missing -- all 3,700 of them. 
</P>
<P>
The dolls -- $92,000 worth of stuffed likenesses of the gruesome "Nightmare on 
Elm Street" film character -- had come from Taiwan, via the Port of Long Beach. 
Like much of the merchandise imported today, they were packed in a cargo 
shipping container. 
</P>
<P>
Upon its arrival, the container was loaded by crane onto a trailer. A truck 
driver hooked the trailer to his tractor and drove the goods to Smith's 
warehouse in Carson. There, employees were to unpack the Freddie dolls and 
distribute them to Toys R Us stores throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
But Freddie never got out of the box. 
</P>
<P>
"They broke through our fence, tore the gate down, stole a company tractor and 
pulled the container out," Smith said. "When we came, the truck was missing and 
the container was missing. It was just one big headache." 
</P>
<P>
That's how Smith and his company, Western Sunset Warehouses, joined the growing 
ranks of victims of what authorities say is a very lucrative crime: container 
cargo theft. 
</P>
<P>
According to law-enforcement officials, thefts of shipping containers are on 
the rise, especially in the Los Angeles and Long Beach harbor areas and in the 
industrial communities that surround the two ports. Thieves are heisting 
container loads of everything from L.A. Gear footwear to Sony compact disc 
players to deluxe bicycles that sport Batman logos. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, the thefts occur at the ports themselves, where containers arrive by 
the thousands each week on massive ships from Japan, South Korea and other 
nations of the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
But far more often, authorities said, the goods are swiped from warehouses like 
Smith's, which act as way stations between the ports and the final destinations 
of the imported goods. And with the rapid growth of the ports, authorities said 
the opportunities for thieves are growing. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the midst of a boom, and so are the thieves," said Harry Hunold, 
chairman of the Port of Los Angeles/Long Beach Cargo Theft Security Council. 
Hunold, a Los Angeles Port Police detective, founded the 110-member 
organization, which focuses on prevention and recovery of stolen goods. 
</P>
<P>
Said FBI Special Agent Randy Ferguson: "It's just been a steady reign of theft. 
Hardly a week goes by that we don't have one or more containers stolen." 
</P>
<P>
The trend has prompted the Los Angeles Harbor Department to review its security 
measures. Ron Kennedy, director of operations for the port, said Harbor 
Department officials are discussing the problem with shipping terminal 
operators and will issue recommendations in January. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the chief of the county's Multijurisdictional Criminal Apprehension 
Detail is proposing that his group establish a team of officers who would 
handle nothing but cargo theft. 
</P>
<P>
The detail, a joint operation of the Sheriff's Department and suburban police 
departments, already has officers who specialize in recovering stolen cargo. 
But Lt. Jim Harris, the sheriff's deputy in charge of the detail, said his 
proposal would enable the organization to devote more time to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Although cargo theft is not limited to the Long Beach and Los Angeles harbor 
areas, much of it is concentrated in the ports and the communities that 
surround them because they are the hub of Southern California's shipping 
activity. Each year, more than 1.5 million cargo containers are shipped through 
the Los Angeles port alone. 
</P>
<P>
The growth in container cargo theft is reflected in Los Angeles Police 
Department statistics, as well as in numbers provided by the 
Multijurisdictional Criminal Apprehension Detail. According to Hunold, the 
cargo security council chief, the Los Angeles police handled 105 cargo thefts 
this year, up from just 20 last year. 
</P>
<P>
And the detail -- which collects data from the Sheriff's Department, the 
California Trucking Assn., the FBI's Long Beach office and the Compton police 
-- reported that, during the first half of this year, those agencies 
investigated as many cargo thefts as they did during all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said the detail's statistics have shown a dramatic increase since 1985. 
That year, the agencies reporting to the detail handled 23 stolen containers, 
with merchandise valued at nearly $2.4 million wholesale. From 1986 to 1988, 
those same agencies handled between 50 and 58 thefts each year. In those cases, 
the annual loss of merchandise ranged from $2.6 million to nearly $7.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Yet by July of this year, Harris said, the Multijurisdictional Criminal 
Apprehension Detail had received reports of 60 container thefts involving 
merchandise valued at $3.5 million -- an indication that the number of 
containers stolen, if not the value of the goods, is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
Harris also said his officers have recovered more stolen cargo this year -- 
nearly $4 million, up from $1 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say cargo theft is popular because it is a low-risk, high-profit 
crime. One container of stolen goods can be worth as much as $750,000, as was 
the case with the Sony compact disc players stolen from the Port of Los Angeles 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
The stolen merchandise winds up in a variety of places. Law enforcement 
officials say it is sometimes sold at swap meets, sometimes in stores whose 
proprietors may know they are purchasing stolen equipment but look the other 
way. Some of it is sold out of state and some out of the country, often just 
across the border in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether they sell it all in one bunch or just sell it 50 at a time, it's pure 
profit," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ferguson and others said, the crime is not that difficult to commit. 
Many warehouses have only fences and locked gates to keep trespassers out. They 
generally do business in out-of-the-way industrial areas, and warehousing 
companies often find it too expensive to employ security guards at night and on 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
That was precisely the case at Western Sunset Warehouses, according to Smith, 
the company president. But after the Freddie Krueger dolls were stolen, the 
company installed a $28,000 security system with an electric gate that opens 
only from the inside, video cameras and motion detectors that will set off 
strobe lights and alarms if an intruder enters. 
</P>
<P>
Stealing containers from the ports is a bit more difficult than stealing from 
warehouses because most shipping terminals have security guards at night. 
Nevertheless, said Hunold of the Los Angeles Port Police, this year thieves 
swiped 12 containers from the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports -- double the 
number stolen last year. 
</P>
<P>
"They come into the terminal at night, physically cut the fence, drive a stolen 
tractor into the fence line, hook up with a trailer with a container on it and 
drive out," Hunold said. "It's very, very bold, and they're getting away with 
it."

MEDFLY STRATEGIES MAY HAVE MASKED PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with an infestation that won't go away, the government may have made a 
critical error in its battle against the Mediterranean fruit fly this summer by 
ordering aerial pesticide spraying before the true size of the pest population 
was known, a leading scientist says. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Cunningham, a U.S. Department of Agriculture Medfly expert in Hawaii and 
chairman of the scientific panel advising the current Medfly eradication 
program, said the rapidity with which malathion-bearing helicopters were 
launched may have, ironically, masked the true size of the infestation and 
provided a false sense of confidence that the problem had been solved. 
</P>
<P>
If the infestation in the Whittier area in October were as large as evidence 
now seems to indicate, the spray might have killed only 90% of the population. 
That still would have left enough of the pests alive to spread, Cunningham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We blinded ourselves with the bait spray," he said. "We must have had a 
sizable population at the start. We did not appreciate that. Maybe in hindsight 
it would have been better to wait and evaluate the situation" before going on 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The experts believe there are several reasons that the pest has been found in 
such diverse locations as Sylmar and Glendora. These reasons include people 
carrying infested fruit out of the Medfly quarantine zone. But Isi Siddiqui, 
assistant director of the California Department of Food and Agriculture's 
Division of Plant Industry, said much of the spreading infestation in the 
central Los Angeles area today emerged from the Medfly hot spot in the Whittier 
area, found on Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
That infestation zone was sprayed on Oct. 4, only eight days after the initial 
find. By that time 61 flies had been found. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved too fast," said Cunningham. He said the original population in 
Whittier must have been very large, but no one will ever know how large because 
of the speed with which treatment was begun. He admitted there is always a 
danger that the infestation will spread while waiting, but he said it might be 
better in the future "to take a little time to get a good handle on the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said he now believes it might be important in the future to change 
the Medfly battle plan, known as the "protocol," to allow more time to gather 
intelligence before starting to fight the flies with spraying and by releasing 
millions of sterile flies. The theory behind releasing sterile flies is that 
they will breed with the fertile flies, preventing the flies from multiplying. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Agricultural Commissioner Leon Spaugy in part agreed with 
Cunningham that the protocol needs revision. But in his view, the particular 
mistake this time may have been moving in with sterile flies after only a 
single application of the bait spray. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is a lesson to be learned, perhaps we ought to evaluate the 
distribution (of flies) very carefully before we rush in with sterile flies," 
he said. "Perhaps we should go with multiple bait sprays before the steriles." 
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui said that, in Florida, the standard procedure for fighting Medfly 
infestations is to apply four dousings of malathion before bringing in sterile 
flies. The California protocol allows for that as well, but authorities said 
they had been able to knock out infestations in 1987 and 1988 in the Los 
Angeles area with only a single application and, as a result, believed that 
would work again. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Medfly experts admit the fly's behavior continues to surprise them. The 
lessons they thought they learned seven years ago, during the much-publicized 
Northern California infestation in 1981-82, have not prepared them for what has 
happened this time. 
</P>
<P>
The frustration of those fighting the crop-destroying pest could be seen Friday 
at a hearing of the state Senate Committee on Agriculture and Water Resources. 
"Something is out of kilter," said Chairman Ruben Ayala (D-Chino). 
</P>
<P>
Pressed for an explanation of why the infestation has spread so far, Siddiqui 
said, "It's a good question." He ticked off a number of possibilities -- 
infested fruit being mailed in, people carrying fruit out of quarantined areas, 
the arrival of immigrants bearing fruit from infested Central American nations, 
and others -- but finally admitted "there is no pattern" to this outbreak.

THERE'S NO TOUGHER WAY FOR RAIDERS TO END YEAR

<P>
Baby, it's cold outside, highs predicted in the teens, wind-chill headed for 
minus numbers, and let's hear a big Gotham welcome for our visitors from 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
What's the opposite of a day at the beach? 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the Raiders' Last Stand. 
</P>
<P>
They're 6 1/2-point underdogs to the Giants today. Even if they pull the upset, 
they need losses by Indianapolis and Cincinnati to reach the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
It's not Mission: Impossible, but it's close. Mort Oldshan of the Gold Sheet 
figures the odds against the Raiders at 25-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders were here 11 weeks ago in Art Shell's debut, but that was on a 
balmy October night against the Jets. Giants Stadium put up green bunting to 
mask the Giants Blue of the stands. No camouflage was possible for the Jets 
themselves, and the Raiders won, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
This is the big team in town, with season tickets handed down in wills, 
guaranteed sellouts and fans braving the elements like entertainment-starved 
Denver-ites. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, there were 72,142 in the stands and 4,944 no-shows on a subzero 
wind-chill day, with the 1-14 Cowboys in town. The Giants won, 15-0, securing a 
playoff berth for the first time since winning Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
They need to win to clinch the NFC East, so the Raiders get no break there, 
either. A victory means a week off to the Giants, who need it. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about your improbable champions . . . 
</P>
<P>
Take away linebackers Lawrence Taylor and Carl Banks and quarterback Phil 
Simms, and there aren't a lot of Giants left who were in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 
25, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are Harry Carson, Jim Burt, George Martin, Phil McConkey, Brad Benson, 
Karl Nelson, Billy Ard and Chris Godfrey. Joe Morris and Mark Bavaro are 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
That's three members of their defensive front, five of their six offensive 
linemen and their leading rusher. 
</P>
<P>
This team is 11-4? 
</P>
<P>
Leading rusher Ottis Anderson has averaged 3.1 yards a carry with his 949 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
If he reaches 1,000, he'll have the lowest average of any NFL back ever to gain 
that many -- by a mile. The lowest to date is Morris' 3.5-yard average last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson is 32 and didn't have this many rushes, 302, in 1985 through '88 
combined -- 260. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants thought so little of Anderson before Morris was hurt in the 
exhibition season, they exposed him to Plan B free agency and, when there were 
no takers, re-signed him at a 50% pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
The once-feared Giant defense has recorded 35 sacks, one more than the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants have allowed 45 sacks, five more than the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Simms has 14 interceptions to go with his 14 touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants have the flair of Coach Bill Parcells -- none -- but they're his 
proudest achievement: They're rock-ribbed, conservative and effective. 
</P>
<P>
Not for them those Ram niceties of winning pretty. The Giants maintain a 
running game by flat-out insisting on it. They run on first and second downs 
and let Simms deal with third-and-longs. If the crowd boos, well, the waiting 
list isn't short on patrons who'd be grateful to see line plunges. 
</P>
<P>
And they still have those linebackers . . . 
</P>
<P>
The runt of the group is Gary Reasons: 6-feet-4, 235 pounds. He blew Bobby 
Humphrey out of the sky on a highlight-film hit at the goal line that the 
locals are calling 1989's version of the inspirational '86 Bavaro reception, on 
which he ferried half the 49er defense downfield. 
</P>
<P>
The others are more famous: Taylor, 6-3, 243; Banks, 6-5, 235, and Pepper 
Johnson, 6-3, 248. 
</P>
<P>
Their specialty is the goal-line stand. In the last three weeks, they've denied 
each foe any points at all on a first-and-goal. Their percentage against the 
fourth-down conversion is 23.5%, best in the league. Remember, these are mostly 
fourth-and-ones. 
</P>
<P>
"They've probably got the best front seven in football," Shell said. "They've 
always had those outside linebackers. Pepper Johnson is having as good a year 
as anybody. 
</P>
<P>
"We go over their personnel as a coaching staff. After Terry Robiskie got done 
talking about their outside linebackers, I said, 'I guess we can't run on them, 
we might as well go home.' " 
</P>
<P>
Shell is 7-4 and could have mailed this one in if his defensive coordinator had 
been able to contain Dave Krieg. If the Raiders had won in Seattle, they'd 
already be in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Shell, of course, is getting a lot of help from Al Davis, but some of it hasn't 
been as helpful as they'd hoped. 
</P>
<P>
Davis liked Zeph Lee, the former USC running back whom he switched to safety. 
It took half the season before the defensive coaches could get Lee out and the 
able Mike Harden in full time. 
</P>
<P>
Lee was subsequently waived without announcement. 
</P>
<P>
A Raider source said Davis expressly ordered Shell not to use Marcus Allen on a 
goal-line dive in Seattle, as Shell had done against Phoenix the week before. 
</P>
<P>
The source said Davis told Shell and Robiskie they shouldn't have done that, 
either, despite the fact that Allen's dives converted a fourth-and-two and 
produced the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
California Gothic, to the end. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
There was much woofing back and forth about the cold and the gusty winds of 
Giants Stadium, but the Raiders will, indeed, have to run effectively against 
the league's No. 5 unit against the rush. . . . Said Giant Coach Bill Parcells: 
"This time of year, if you're not used to coming here, it's a little different 
. . . (At) our practice (Wednesday), it was about 16 degrees. We were out there 
2 1/2 hours." 
</P>
<P>
Said Raider Coach Art Shell: "Hey, it's going to be cold. And I don't care what 
anyone says, they're going to be cold, too. I don't care where you are, you 
don't become accustomed to it. They're going to be just as cold as we are. . . 
. I can remember, we went to Cleveland (for the 1980 Ice Bowl), and Dave Dalby 
went out in just his T-shirt for early warm-ups, like he'd normally do. I 
thought he was crazy. His mind-set was, 'I'm not going to let the conditions 
bother me.' I wouldn't do that. I didn't think it was smart. Dave was a 
different breed." 
</P>
<P>
Add different breed: Bo Jackson was primed to hit 1,000 yards last week in his 
10th game. A Raider source said Bo was talking about just what it would take -- 
156 yards. Indeed, Jackson again ran like a man possessed in the first half, 
when he got 53 yards, before taking a shot to the ribs. After that, he 
continued to play in obvious pain, winning some real respect. "He's got torn 
rib cartilage," the Raider said. "He's hurt as badly as any running back we've 
got. You've got to respect him. Last year, I didn't care if he came back here 
or not." Jackson needs 87 yards to get his 1,000 now, and the Raiders need him 
to get them. 
</P>
<P>
Raider left guard John Gesek and left tackle Rory Graves, 1-2 on the team in 
holding calls, will be matched against the Giants' right end Leonard Marshall, 
who has nine sacks, and Lawrence Taylor, who has 13 1/2. Graves is listed as 
doubtful with a sprained foot. If he can't go, journeyman Steve Wright will. . 
. . Raider quarterback Steve Beuerlein, on the Giant rush: "Call me stupid, but 
I don't worry about it. I have confidence in my line. . . . I'll take a few 
hits. That's my game. I'll stand in there."

'Twas the day before Christmas and all through the house not a creature was 
stirring -- they were all on the couch watching the Rams and Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
All right, St. Nicholas, you pious old fraud. Come in and drop your bag. If 
you're making a list and checking it twice, how about the following for a merry 
little Christmas? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give the Dodgers a center fielder, they already got enough second basemen 
and right fielders to start a league. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give boxing another Joe Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Charlie Whittingham another Sunday Silence. Give Laz Barrera another 
Affirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Laffit Pincay the mount on either one of them. Give Chris McCarron the 
other one. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give the USC Trojans another Mike Garrett or O.J. Simpson or Marcus Allen. 
Give us back Student Body Right. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give the Raiders a quarterback, Al Davis will take it from there. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give L.A. the Olympics again. Or, rather, give the Olympics L.A. Twice in 
50 years the city saved it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Magic Johnson a man in the pivot to play off. It doesn't have to be 
another Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. A Bill Laimbeer would do. Magic can't take on the 
league's skyscrapers, the Patrick Ewings, David Robinsons, Akeem Olajuwons by 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Mike Ditka a rubber room. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

mind. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give the Cowboys back to America. 
</P>
<P>

 -- Give Flipper Anderson a pass that stays up and a zone he can beat. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give the Cubs a pennant. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Mark Langston another pitch or a fast outfield so the press can't crow 
that he's getting a million dollars an inning on his bad nights. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Larry Bird the outside shot with the playoff on the line and the 
defender sagging, just one more time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Mike Tyson a Gene Tunney so he can become a lovable figure in sports 
instead of a scary one. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Cito Gaston or Frank Robinson a pennant so we can get on with it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Wayne Lukas another pretty little filly who doesn't know she's not 
supposed to beat the boys in the spring of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give San Diego an America's Cup challenge. Let the New Zealanders win it in 
the waters, not the courts, with a boat, not a writ. Can you imagine Sir Thomas 
Lipton letting some landlubber in a wig and a robe award him the cup? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Michael Jordan the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Wayne Gretzky the puck. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 -- Give Gene Autry a pennant. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Mario Andretti a car that will hold together for 200 laps and Roger 
Penske to set it up for him so it will. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Al Davis the keys to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Pete Rose back baseball. He's sick, not crooked. The Black Sox's 
addiction was greed, not gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give the states the word to stop trying to solve fiscal problems by 
legalizing gambling. They'll create more problems than they'll solve. They'll 
achieve a human deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give golf another Jack Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Rickey Henderson an MVP or discontinue the award. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Wade Boggs a cold shower. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Steve Garvey a hobby. Come to think of it, he has one. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give Don Zimmer a lineup he can juggle. Better yet, give him one he can't 
juggle. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give us an overtime Super Bowl. But, first, pass a rule it can't be decided 
by a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give instant replay to the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give the designated hitter to the birds. That's what it's for. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give the Jets, Atlanta and Tampa Bay a coach. Look what a difference one 
made to Green Bay, Kansas City and Detroit. To say nothing of San Francisco 10 
years ago and Green Bay 30 years ago. There are no bad teams in the NFL, only 
bad schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give me the day off. On second thought, I just took it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Give each and every one of our sports fans out there the merriest of 
holidays and winners on the cards. Just remember, everything turns to sugar 
anyway. So, enjoy.

SEAHAWKS FAIL TO WARM COCKLES OF RAMS' HEARTS 
</P>

<P>
No thanks to the Seattle Seahawks, the Rams could only clench their teeth on 
Saturday. They were hoping to clinch a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
Shivering in anticipation of today's game against the New England Patriots, the 
Rams hoped their fate would be sealed before they braved frigid winds at 
Sullivan Stadium. The Rams could have secured a wild-card playoff spot Saturday 
had the Seahawks defeated the Washington Redskins. The Redskins won, 29-0. 
</P>
<P>
So now it's up to Ram quarterback Jim Everett and the sideline hand-warmers. 
</P>
<P>
The playoff situation: The Rams clinch a wild-card spot if they win. A victory 
also gives them home-field advantage in a wild-card game against the New York 
Giants if the Raiders defeat the Giants today and Philadelphia beats Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Should the Giants win the division and Philadelphia wins to finish in a tie 
with the Rams at 11-5, the Eagles will play host to the wild-card game. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the Rams can lose today's game and still qualify if either Green 
Bay, Philadelphia, or Minnesota loses this weekend. The Packers will play 
Dallas today, while the Vikings play host to Cincinnati Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was so cold in New England this week that Patriots owner Victor Kiam 
reportedly gave 4,000 tickets away to area Boy Scouts in an attempt to beef up 
attendance. Nice gesture, except some complained it was more an act of child 
abuse than charity. 
</P>
<P>
Today's turnout could be the smallest at a professional football game since the 
spring league folded. This, in the wake of General Manager Dick Steinberg's 
fleeing the organization for the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, Doug Flutie, wonder of wonders, remains on the roster. Former Raider 
Marc Wilson, who knows a thing or two about boos, was brought in to replace 
Tony Eason, who had become such a tomato target in New England that the 
Patriots finally released him in November. 
</P>
<P>
"The environment in the stadium was so hostile that I don't think anybody could 
have made it back under those conditions," Patriot Coach Raymond Berry said of 
Eason's departure. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, Eason caught on with the friendly New York Jet patrons. 
</P>
<P>
So now it's Wilson, but he suffered an injured index finger on his throwing 
hand in last week's loss to Pittsburgh and probably won't make it today. Which 
leaves the ageless, gray-haired veteran, Steve Grogan, to take on the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots have used four quarterbacks this season, and they barely have a 
win apiece to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
Berry knew it was going to be rough when All-Pro linebacker Andre Tippett 
didn't make it through the exhibition season. Tippett was placed on injured 
reserve Sept. 4 because of a shoulder injury that required surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots have also had off seasons from: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Running back John Stephens. He rushed for 1,000 yards and made the Pro Bowl 
as a rookie in 1988, but a chronic ankle injury has limited him to 792 rushing 
yards and a 3.5 yards-per-carry average. 
</P>
<P>
Berry on Stephens: "He's not playing like he did a year ago. I don't think I've 
seen John play like himself more than three games all year. Being such a big 
part of our offense, it's taken its toll on us." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Receiver Irving Fryar. He has started only four games because of various 
injuries and has only 23 catches. Veteran receiver Stanley Morgan was lost 
after Week 10 after suffering a broken leg during practice. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Receiver Hart Lee Dykes. The team's first-round pick is finally coming 
around. 
</P>
<P>
"He was late to camp and was in terrible condition when he came in," Berry 
said. "He was working out of a hole." 
</P>
<P>
Dykes has dug himself out with three 100-yard receiving games since 
mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
As for quarterback Everett, his short career comes full circle in his rematch 
with the Patriots, who provided the backdrop for his NFL debut in 1986. 
Remember? Everett comes off the bench at Anaheim Stadium with his team 
trailing, 14-0, in the second quarter. His first NFL completion was a 34-yard 
scoring pass to Henry Ellard. In all, he completed 12 of 19 passes for 193 
yards and three touchdowns, and gave his team the lead in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Remember also that it wasn't good enough, that Eason beat the Rams with a 
25-yard "Hail Mary" scoring pass to Fryar as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
Everett's hoping for a better ending this time. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gary Jeter, the former Ram defensive end who signed with New England as a Plan 
B free agent last spring, was placed on injured reserve Dec. 15 because of a 
strained lower back. Jeter played in 14 games this season, none as a starter, 
and finished with seven sacks for 40 yards. . . . The Patriots are 11-18 in 
season-ending games, but 4-0 in final games played at Sullivan Stadium. . . . 
Quarterback Jim Everett has only two fewer rushes this season than reserve 
running back Gaston Green, 24 to 26, and has a longer run from scrimmage, 13 to 
nine. . . . Greg Bell needs 73 rushing yards to reach 1,000 for the second 
consecutive season and the third time in his career.

CLIPPERS STILL WOEFUL ROAD WARRIORS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: THEY LOSE, 104-100, AT PHOENIX AS SUNS HOLD HARPER TO 12 
POINTS. LOS ANGELES IS 0-10 ON THE ROAD.

<TEXT>
<P>
Reaching the .500 mark by the end of the month, an unofficial goal for some 
players, disappeared amid another Clipper offensive malfunction Saturday night, 
fittingly on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Missing good scoring opportunities all night, they lost to the Phoenix Suns, 
104-100, at Veterans Memorial Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the Clippers were tired after playing four games in a week, including 
back-to-back on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"Tired?" Ron Harper said. "We played like we were tired, but we shouldn't be 
tired. We are practicing hard, but we're getting time off. We just need to get 
a different attitude on the road. . . . Some guys come in and are laughing and 
joking anytime we're on the road." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, 0-10 away from the Sports Arena, have little to smile about 
anytime they get near an airport. 
</P>
<P>
They used an 8-2 run in the fourth quarter Saturday night to pull within 91-96 
with 2:38 remaining. It was a five-point difference, 98-93, when Harper made 
two free throws with 1:10 to play. 
</P>
<P>
But that's as close as the Clippers (9-14) got. To get there, though, took some 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Smith got his third foul with 3:32 to go in the first quarter. He 
played 21 minutes, getting 19 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Norman played 20 minutes, hitting three of 11 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Harper made five of 12 shots en route to 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the Clipper scoring. Or at least where it usually comes from. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the Suns juggled the lineup to slow down Harper, but with a twist. 
With Dan Majerle moved from forward to guard to matchup with Harper, Tim Perry 
started at forward. The same Tim Perry who had not played in three consecutive 
games and, like several other young players, had fallen in such disfavor with 
Cotton Fitzsimmons that the Suns' coach promised last week that they wouldn't 
play much. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm done fooling around," is how Fitzsimmons put it to local reporters last 
week. "I'm going to use players who know how to play the game. If I have to 
play my young guys, we're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
When it came down to it, the Suns weren't so much in trouble as playing the 
Clippers. Majerle, one young Sun whom Fitzsimmons raves about, held Harper to 
three-of-14 shooting in the last meeting. This time, L.A.'s top scoring threat 
went four of 11 in the first half -- two dunks and two layups accounting for 
the makes. 
</P>
<P>
Harper discounted the Majerle factor, with emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to guard somebody when they don't have the ball," Harper said, 
noting he wanted his teammates to get into the offensive flow early. 
</P>
<P>
And: "When they (the Suns) come to L.A., we'll see if he shuts me down." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers made only 39.1% of their field goal attempts in the first half and 
trailed, 49-40, at the intermission. That included an 18-point second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hornacek, who went from starter to reserve in the temporary lineup, looked 
like a star in any role. He had a season-high 28 points, including 13 in the 
first half on six-of-six shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"Defense and intensity carried us through the ballgame," Fitzsimmons said. 
"When we had to stop (the Clippers) we did. . . . It was an up-tempo game, 
which is what we like. Kurt Rambis made some key plays for us. Jeff Hornacek 
lit it up again tonight. Tim Perry was fine. He's young and he makes some 
mistakes, but he gave us what we needed to win. He did a fine job on Norman. 
Dan Majerle did an outstanding job on Harper." 
</P>
<P>
Smiles all around for Phoenix, which hasn't exactly been the norm for a team 
that has struggled at times after reaching the Western Conference finals last 
season. Against the Clippers, the Suns got 23 points from Tom Chambers and 10 
rebounds from Mark West to complement Hornacek. 
</P>
<P>
Rambis, typically crowd-pleasing with the same workman-like attitude that made 
him a favorite in Los Angeles, had nine points and six rebounds in 18 minutes 
off the bench. But his biggest plays came in helping to force the Clippers into 
one of their 19 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after Smith's jumper from the right side cut the Suns' lead to 96-91, 
Rambis, acquired in a Dec. 13 trade with the Charlotte Hornets, stripped the 
ball from Smith as the Clipper forward came down the lane. That started a fast 
break that resulted in Kevin Johnson's layup for a seven-point cushion. 
</P>
<P>
On the next Clipper possession, Gary Grant got caught in traffic and looked for 
an outlet. Rambis stepped in front of his pass. The Suns didn't convert it into 
another basket, but the Clippers, fresh off the 8-2 rally, never made another 
run.

THINGS DON'T ALWAYS COME UP ROSES; 
</P>
<P>
ROSE BOWL: A TARDY PARTICIPATING TEAM, TWO PHANTOM TOUCHDOWNS AND WOODY HAYES' 
TANTRUMS HAVE ALL BEEN A PART OF THE NEW YEAR'S DAY GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A near fist-fight between rival coaches, phantom touchdowns, a coach's 
tantrums. Is this any way to start the New Year? 
</P>
<P>
Things don't always come up roses in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
There are some thorns among the dramatic moments, upsets and spectacular plays 
that are part of the lore of the Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
For reference, see Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler, who will be making his 10th 
appearance in Pasadena Jan. 1 against USC, with a record of two victories, 
seven losses and one disputed touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
After the first Rose Bowl game in 1902 between Michigan and Stanford at 
Tournament Park, a polo match and then chariot races replaced the game through 
1915. 
</P>
<P>
There is no documentation of chariot disputes, but in the first Rose Bowl game 
played at its present site the grumbling began before the teams even came onto 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1923: GET ME TO THE GAME ON TIME 
</P>
<P>
This would be USC's first of 27 appearances in the Rose Bowl and the Trojans 
were the second choice to represent the West. 
</P>
<P>
California, which had won the Pacific Coast Conference championship and had 
defeated USC, declined the invitation for unspecified reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Eastern representative, Penn State, had been invited in April of the 
previous year, but still the Nittany Lions couldn't get to the game on time. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Elmer (Gloomy Gus) Henderson and his players stewed on the field 
awaiting Penn State's arrival. The game was scheduled to start at 2:30 p.m., 
but Penn State didn't arrive until 45 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State's coach, Hugo Bezdek, was not a stranger to Pasadena, so he couldn't 
have claimed that he was lost. He had the unusual background of having coached 
Oregon and the Mare Island Marines to victories in the 1917 and 1918 Rose Bowl 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson confronted Bedzek, who was standing alone on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Where have you been?" Henderson demanded. 
</P>
<P>
"We got caught in a traffic jam," Bezdek replied. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson: "You tried to stall so we would get itchy." 
</P>
<P>
Bezdek: "You're a liar." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson: "You're a lot of bunk." 
</P>
<P>
Bezdek: "Take off your glasses and we'll settle the whole matter right here." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson declined, saying later that he wanted no part of Bezdek, who had 
earned his way through the University of Chicago by fighting under an assumed 
name. 
</P>
<P>
If Bezdek had planned to gain a psychological advantage by being late, it 
didn't work as the Trojans won, 14-3. 
</P>
<P>
Bezdek was hardly charitable in defeat, saying: 
</P>
<P>
"The best team lost. The best team and the best coaching in the world wouldn't 
have won against the luck USC had today. When at its best, my team could beat 
USC by 40 points. My only regret is that Elmer Henderson had left his glasses 
on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1949: RAISING CAIN WITH CAL 
</P>
<P>
Instant replay: Where was it when it was needed the most? 
</P>
<P>
In the category of controversial touchdowns, the 1949 Rose Bowl game between 
Northwestern and California still has an eminent place. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third game of the series between the Pacific Coast Conference and 
the Big Ten (then called the Big Nine). 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, Northwestern fullback Art Murakowski fumbled while 
lunging for a touchdown from the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
A picture in The Times showed that Murakowski's feet were not in the end zone, 
but referee Jimmy Cain nevertheless signaled a touchdown, ruling that 
Murakowski fumbled after his body had crossed the plane of the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
That decision was challenged then, as it still is today, by photographic 
evidence, although camera angles can be deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
Murakowski's touchdown and subsequent missed extra point provided Northwestern 
with a 13-7 lead. The Wildcats went on to win, 20-14, getting the winning 
touchdown on Ed Tunnicliff's 43-yard run late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Although Cain made the touchdown signal, the actual decision was the 
responsibility of field judge Jay Berwanger. 
</P>
<P>
Berwanger, as you may recall, was the first Heisman Trophy winner in 1935, from 
the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Northwestern hasn't played in a Rose Bowl game since 1949, and with its 
football program on the downgrade, it may never again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE WACKY WORLD OF WOODY 
</P>
<P>
Woody Hayes, Ohio State's late coach, made an indelible impression in his many 
trips to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The cantankerous Hayes set a standard for boorish behavior in his first 
appearance in the Rose Bowl in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
He complained about the bands chewing up an already muddy field and he was less 
than gracious after the Buckeyes beat the Trojans, 20-7. 
</P>
<P>
Excerpts from Woody's bombast: 
</P>
<P>
"The bands should have been required to stay on the sidelines instead of 
putting on the show where we were going to play. I think bands are a fine thing 
but they owe their popularity to football, not the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
"There are about four, possibly five teams in the Big Ten that could beat USC. 
Big Ten teams are better in the Rose Bowl because they are raised on tougher 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes was hardly a seer, though, considering that the Pac-10 has beaten the Big 
Ten in 18 of the last 24 Rose Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
The Ohio State coach's ugliest display of temper occurred in the 1973 Rose Bowl 
game against USC. 
</P>
<P>
Before the game, he shoved a camera held by The Times' Art Rogers into the 
photographer's face. Rogers required medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, which the national champion Trojans won, 42-17, Hayes was asked 
about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
He exploded, cursing a reporter and storming out of the interview tent. 
</P>
<P>
A criminal battery suit on behalf of Rogers was later dropped when Hayes sent a 
letter of apology. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1979: WHO NEEDS THE BALL TO SCORE? 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years after Murakowski scored his disputed touchdown in the Rose Bowl, 
USC's Charles White revived the play against Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Only this time television instant replay was available to show that officials 
botched the call. 
</P>
<P>
Here was the situation: 
</P>
<P>
USC had the ball on the Michigan three-yard line in the second quarter when 
White, the tailback, sky-dived toward the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
He reached it all right, but without the ball, leaving it at the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
One official signaled a touchdown, another ruled that Michigan had gained 
possession by recovering a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
Referee Paul Kamanski cast the tiebreaking vote, saying that the line judge, 
Gilbert Marchman, was in charge of forward progress of the ball. Since the line 
judge was emphatic that the ball had broken the plane of the goal line, 
Kamanski concluded that White had scored. 
</P>
<P>
Others who watched the instant replay, ardently disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, White's touchdown gave USC a 14-3 lead, and the Trojans went on 
to win, 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
The victory provided USC with a share of the national championship with Alabama 
and left Schembechler with an 0-5 record in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Bo had an opinion on the play, saying: "From what all our players say, he 
didn't score. I don't want to talk about it. If I do, I'll sure as hell say 
something that will get me into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I have some definite thoughts but I don't want to relate them here. It's a 
shame something like that had to distract from the effort of the kids, but the 
fact remains we didn't play well enough to win." 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, USC scored the winning touchdown in a 17-13 victory over Notre Dame in 
a similar fashion, with tailback Michael Harper seemingly losing the ball while 
diving into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Said Schembechler at the time: "USC has perfected that play."

MIKE DOWNEY: CHRISTMAS SPIRIT LIVES IN CANADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christmas cards came to me at my office the past few days, from the Angels, the 
Dodgers, the Raiders, the Rams . . . and the Calgary Flames. I kid you not. 
</P>
<P>
I wasn't even sure they had Christmas in Canada. I thought maybe they 
celebrated All Pucks Day, or the feast of St. Pauli Girl. 
</P>
<P>
"This season brings a greater appreciation of old friendships and new 
associations," the card read. Signed: the Calgary Flames Hockey Club. 
</P>
<P>
Well, I was touched. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, I had never thought of myself as a new association of the Calgary 
Flames, even after I visited their fine city to watch the 1988 Winter Olympics 
and the 1989 Stanley Cup playoffs. Had I known that I was going to be making 
new associations up there, I'd have dressed better. 
</P>
<P>
Anyhow, it turns out that Canadians are absolutely full of the Christmas 
spirit. The spirit of sharing. The spirit of giving. 
</P>
<P>
How do I know? 
</P>
<P>
Because they just keep giving and giving and giving. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Southern California, they have given us Wayne Gretzky and Larry 
Robinson to play hockey for the Kings, they have given us Mervyn Fernandez to 
catch passes for the Raiders, they have given us Mark Langston to pitch 
baseballs for the Angels, and now they have given us Hubie Brooks to hit 
baseballs for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
What a country! 
</P>
<P>
Canadians just keep giving and giving, till it hurts. Our good friends north of 
the border truly do believe that it is better to give than to receive. We in 
America even gave them Jimmy Carson as payment for Gretzky, but they gave him 
right back. 
</P>
<P>
Canada is becoming America's farm club. It just keeps sending us foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
Can't we give something back? Can't we make a donation to these generous people 
who provide us with so much? When the Toronto Blue Jays make a trade with the 
New York Yankees, they are nice enough to send them Jesse Barfield. What do the 
Yankees send back? Al Leiter. It was like bartering with the Indians again for 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Canadians have been feeling generous, since hockey is the only sport 
they truly care about. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Canada also is still stuck with the Quebec Nordiques, the NHL's 
lousiest team, and the Vancouver Canucks, possibly the second-lousiest team, 
and Harold Ballard, the dotty old goofus who has run the Toronto Maple Leafs 
into the ice. 
</P>
<P>
And Canada is still home to Ben (Better Running Through Chemistry) Johnson, the 
Olympic sprinter, although plans have been made, generously, to give him back 
to Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the athletes who leave Canada do so not because they dislike living 
there, but because they dislike the way their $3-million-a-year contracts are 
only worth about $2 million in U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
They also leave because their wives want to be actresses. It isn't enough to 
host "A.M. Edmonton." It isn't enough to act in off-off-off-off-Broadway shows. 
Canadian actresses do have a sidewalk where they place their footprints in wet 
cement, but unfortunately, the sidewalk has only six footprints so far. 
</P>
<P>
Hubie Brooks is the latest to bolt Canada for better opportunities in the 
States. He is a right fielder and third baseman who signed with a team that 
already has a right fielder and a third baseman. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers are unconcerned. They are going to start an outfield of Kal Daniels 
in left, Juan Samuel in center, Kirk Gibson in right and Hubie Brooks in 
between somewhere. The old four-man outfield. 
</P>
<P>
Ten bucks says the ball still drops. 
</P>
<P>
These guys can play the outfield every bit as well as the 1927 Yankees. Of 
course, the outfielders of the 1927 Yankees are all dead. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel doesn't even want to play the outfield. He wants to play second base. We 
saw him play the outfield last season. He should play second base. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers also got him to be a leadoff hitter. From 1984 through '87, Samuel 
tied the major league record for most consecutive seasons leading a league in 
strikeouts. Nice leadoff hitter. 
</P>
<P>
But the Dodgers are not done dealing. Let's give them until April to see what 
else they have up their sleeves besides Fernando Valenzuela at about a 
quarter-million dollars a win. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, the spirit of giving is not necessarily confined to Canadians. Look 
at that big trade the Dodgers made with the St. Louis Cardinals, the big Pedro 
Guerrero-for-Nobody trade. We don't have to worry, though, if we have any more 
holes to fill in the lineup. One phone call to Canada and we can have anybody 
the Expos or Blue Jays have got. 
</P>
<P>
Canada is our friend.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;

MICHIGAN TURNS BACK SETON HALL AGAIN IN REMATCH, 91-86 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight months ago, he sealed Michigan's national championship victory over Seton 
Hall with a pair of free throws in overtime. In Saturday's rematch, Rumeal 
Robinson was again instrumental in leading the Wolverines over the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson scored 11 of his 26 points in the last eight minutes as No. 6 Michigan 
held off a late Seton Hall surge to win, 91-86, at Thomas &amp; Mack Center in 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall lost all five starters from last year's squad, while Michigan 
returned four. "Therefore, it was just a basketball game we knew we had to come 
in here and win," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall rallied from a nine-point halftime deficit to take a 75-74 lead with 
6:24 left in the game before Robinson answered with a three-point basket to put 
Michigan ahead for good. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson had 11 of his team's last 21 points as Michigan (8-1) won its eighth 
in a row. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Robinson's free throws in the closing seconds of overtime proved 
decisive in the Wolverines' 80-79 win. 
</P>
<P>
Frantz Volcy had 25 points and Oliver Taylor 21 for Seton Hall (5-2). 
</P>
<P>
No. 13 Nevada Las Vegas 97, No. 16 Iowa 80 -- David Butler marked his return to 
the lineup with 18 points and the Rebels' smothering defense took its toll on 
the Hawkeyes in the first game of a doubleheader at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Butler, a senior center who missed UNLV's first six games with academic 
problems, scored nine points in the first half as the Rebels overcame a slow 
start to lead by 18 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Bice had a career-high 19 points for UNLV (5-2), whose pressure defense 
forced 24 turnovers in the first half.

NEWSWIRE: NAVY JOB COULD GO TO STALLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gene Stallings, former coach of the Phoenix Cardinals, has been interviewed for 
the vacant head coaching job at Navy, the Phoenix Gazette reported. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Stallings, who owns a ranch in Paris, Tex., was interviewed 
in Dallas by Jack Lengyel, Navy athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Stallings told the Annapolis Capital: "If I were going to go back to the 
college level, Navy would be one of the few places I would consider." 
</P>
<P>
Stallings reportedly was recommended to Lengyel by former Navy quarterback 
Roger Staubach, who played for the Dallas Cowboys when Stallings was an 
assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
Stallings, 54, was fired by Phoenix on Nov. 20 after announcing that he would 
not seek to have his contract renewed after this season. He was in his fourth 
season with the Cardinals and had a 23-34-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy job became available when Elliott Uzelac was fired Dec. 12 with one 
year left on his four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
Navy reportedly has interviewed only five for the job so far -- Stallings, 
Marshall's George Chaump, The Citadel's Charlie Taafe, Virginia assistant Tom 
O'Brien and William &amp; Mary's Jimmye Laycock.

After talking with Denver Nuggets co-owner Peter Bynoe, forward Alex English 
has softened his demand to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
English, who last week went public with a desire to escape the acerbic style of 
Denver Coach Doug Moe, said after meeting with Bynoe in Orlando, Fla., that he 
is willing to at least discuss the possibility of remaining with the team for 
the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (Bynoe) that we'd talk again next week, when we're back in Denver," 
English said. "I did express that Denver is a place I love dearly. I really 
enjoy living there, and it's become a part of my life." 
</P>
<P>
English said he plans to meet with Bynoe and Moe in the near future.

FAREWELL TO LARGENT IS SPOILED; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: SEAHAWKS LOSE, 29-0, TO REDSKINS IN RECEIVER'S LAST GAME. HIS 
TOUCHDOWN RECEPTION RECORD REMAINS AT 100.

<P>
Among Steve Largent's receiving records is most touchdowns. In his NFL finale, 
it was one record he couldn't add on to. 
</P>
<P>
Largent, 35, caught two passes for 41 yards Saturday to extend his 
consecutive-game reception record to 177, but the Washington Redskins, behind 
the passing of Mark Rypien and the running of Earnest Byner, beat the Seahawks, 
29-0. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an emotional time for me," said Largent, who completed his 14-year NFL 
career. "But I'm pretty disgusted with the way we played." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Largent tried to look at the positive side. 
</P>
<P>
"After the game, I said (to his teammates), 'I don't want anyone feeling bad 
for me because of the game or the score. I've had so many good things happen in 
my career, this game was really inconsequential.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins applauded Largent, who finished his career with 819 catches, 
13,089 receiving yards and 100 touchdown receptions. 
</P>
<P>
"Largent's career is a fantastic testimony to what's good in the NFL," Redskin 
Coach Joe Gibbs said. "Everybody in the NFL will miss him." 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins (10-6) won their fifth consecutive game as Rypien completed 22 of 
31 passes for 290 yards. Gary Clark caught nine for 149 yards, including a 
44-yard touchdown in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Byner scored on runs of two and eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
Washington was eliminated from the playoffs -- for the second consecutive 
season after winning Super Bowl XXII -- last week. 
</P>
<P>
"You're not satisfied when you don't make the playoffs. But the way we finished 
makes me eager for the start of next year," Byner said. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks (7-9) were eliminated from the playoffs when Buffalo beat the New 
York Jets, 37-0, earlier Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think that had any effect on the way we played," Largent said. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks, whose three-game winning streak ended, had their first losing 
season in seven years under Coach Chuck Knox. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle quarterback Dave Krieg set an NFL record for fumbles in a single 
season, 18. He broke the record of 17 set by Houston Oiler quarterback Dan 
Pastorini in 1973 and tied by Oiler quarterback Warren Moon in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"Mistakes hurt us this season," Krieg said. "I wish it was easily correctable, 
but we just kept making them." 
</P>
<P>
Krieg was sacked in the end zone by Fred Stokes for a safety in the third 
quarter, one of four times he was sacked for losses totaling 37 yards, and also 
threw his 20th interception of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes wanted to talk about what might have been for the NFC Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of depressing when you look at the AFC and see the teams in the 
playoffs with records worse than ours," he said. "Yes, we feel kind of 
cheated." 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks were shut out for the first time since losing, 37-0, to the 
Raiders in the Kingdome Dec. 8, 1982, a span of 48 regular-season games. 
</P>

Chip Lohmiller kicked field goals of 29 and 27 yards in the first half as the 
Redskins took a 13-0 lead. They scored 16 points in the third quarter and gave 
up a chance to score a touchdown at the end of the game when they downed the 
ball three consecutive times inside the Seattle 10.

JETS ARE MAT AS BUFFALO ENTERS THE PLAYOFF DOOR;

<P>
BILLS: THEY WIN AFC EAST AGAIN, BEATING THE SAME TEAM AS LAST SEASON TO CLINCH 
THE TITLE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It didn't happen as early as it did last season, but the Buffalo Bills are AFC 
East champions. 
</P>
<P>
The clincher came in Week 12 last season, and this year it was on the Saturday 
of the last weekend. Both clinchers, however, were at the expense of the New 
York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Kelly's two touchdowns led the Bills to a 37-0 victory, as one-sided as 
last year's divisional race. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year it was early, this year it was struggle, struggle, but we're there 
again," Buffalo nose tackle Fred Smerlas said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no struggle for the Jets Saturday, except for the few fans who 
ventured to Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The game started with the temperature at 16 degrees and a wind-chill factor of 
minus-11. There were 21,148 in attendance, but there were 55,743 no-shows, 
believed to be an NFL record. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was the smallest at a non-strike Jet game since 5,826 attended a game 
against Buffalo at the Polo Grounds on Dec. 14, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a real stinging wind," Buffalo Coach Marv Levy said. "It was one of 
the nicer days we've seen in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
The weather and the loss weren't all that made it a bleak day for Jet Coach Joe 
Walton. It has been widely speculated this was his last game as Jet coach after 
taking over for the 1983 season. 
</P>
<P>
"If you stay in this business long enough, there are going to be bad times," 
said Walton, who said he wants to return next season. "I'll meet with the team 
tomorrow, thank them and wish them a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills (9-7), who had lost five of seven, ended a three-game losing streak. 
"Is it a relief to win it?" Levy asked, repeating a question. "There's always 
that pressure, but it is sweet. We've struggled hard to get here. We have been 
in first place for 32 straight weeks. It's hard to please people." 
</P>
<P>
The division title was the sixth for the Bills, who lost to Cincinnati in the 
AFC championship game last season. 
</P>
<P>
"This team deserves a lot of credit," Levy said. "They hung in there and won 
the division by earning it." 
</P>
<P>
The Jets, who lost to Buffalo, 34-3, earlier in the season, finished 4-12, 
their worst record since going 4-12 in 1980. Instead of playoffs, what's next 
for the franchise is a much-awaited meeting Tuesday between Walton and Dick 
Steinberg, the team's new general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly finished 13 for 21 for 208 yards with Andre Reed catching six passes for 
80 yards. "We were the Bills of the first five games today," Reed said. "Our 
offense was clicking and our defense was clicking." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills opened the scoring with a 26-yard field goal by Scott Norwood with 
4:26 to play in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets, who were shut out by Pittsburgh two weeks ago, had one scoring chance 
but it ended when Pat Leahy's 30-yard field goal attempt was blocked with 8:14 
left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It was all Buffalo from there. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Kinnebrew ran in from one yard 1:07 before halftime for a 10-0 lead. The 
Bills stretched it out in the third with Kelly connecting with James Lofton on 
a 25-yard pass play with 10:49 left in the quarter. It was the same distance on 
the next scoring play, this time a pass to Ronnie Harmon in the left corner of 
the end zone, and the Bills led, 23-0, with 4:39 left in the third. 
</P>
<P>
"That touchdown before the half was big, but the game still wasn't over then," 
Levy said. "Jim played very well. He was a big contributor. Our team has to 
continue to play well, not just Kelly." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills made the score 30-0 on a three-yard run by Thurman Thomas shortly 
before the third quarter ended. 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Davis ended the scoring with a 17-yard run with 2:44 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Kinnebrew had 91 yards in 17 carries, while Thomas had 73 in 17 carries.

IT PROMISES TO BE A COLORFUL GAME; 
</P>
<P>
BLUE-GRAY: COLLEGE ALL-STAR CONTEST WILL FEATURE CHARLIE FINLEY'S 
FLUORESCENT-STRIPED FOOTBALL. 
</P>

<P>
The Blue-Gray All-Star game gives Charlie Finley a chance to prove that the 
pigskin could use a little color, and some small-college players an opportunity 
to show they can make it in the big time. 
</P>
<P>
Finley, as owner of the Oakland Athletics, introduced baseball to brightly 
colored uniforms and white shoes, the designated hitter and an orange baseball. 
Now he's pushing a fluorescent-striped football. 
</P>
<P>
The ball, which already has been tried by high schools in nine states, will be 
used for the first time at the college level when the North meets the South in 
the Christmas Day game (9 a.m. PST, Ch. 7). 
</P>
<P>
Finley's invention is a regulation football with eight fluorescent-yellow 
stripes running its length. He said the stripes make it easier for spectators, 
and the players, to keep up with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I always had difficulty following the football," Finley said. "I think that 
we, the television viewers, are certainly entitled to be able to follow the 
ball. If you can't see the ball, you can't enjoy the game." 
</P>
<P>
Finley said the ball has received favorable reviews, but this will be the first 
test in a nationally televised game. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't worry about the colleges," Finley said. "If the high schools approve 
of the ball, the college and pros will both follow suit. They'll be forced to 
use it. The fans and spectators will force them to use it." 
</P>
<P>
Finley was in Hot Springs, Ark., last week to show the ball to Joe Reese, 
president of the National Federation of Interscholastic Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Reese said he plans to introduce legislation when the coaches' group meets next 
month in Tucson, Ariz., that would allow all high schools the option of using 
the striped ball, which also will be used next month at the Hula Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue-Gray game features small-college stars and Division I players whose 
teams were not invited to a bowl -- either because of their record or, in 
Houston's case, because the team is on probation. Five Cougars will play for 
the South. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Bailey of Texas A&amp;I, college football's all-time leading rusher, 
said the game is a chance to prove his record was no fluke just because the 
yardage was piled up against Division II schools. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my chance to really show the pro scouts, and the nation, what I can 
do," said Bailey, who will play for the South. "For four years, I have been 
criticized, and this is my opportunity to prove everybody wrong. This is my 
chance to show that I can compete with Division I players." 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-7, 179-pound tailback rushed for 6,320 yards at Texas A&amp;I, 
surpassing the NCAA record set by Heisman Trophy winner Tony Dorsett at 
Pittsburgh from 1973-76. Bailey was a three-time winner of the Harlon Hill 
Trophy as the top player in Division II. 
</P>
<P>
A player on the North team also has a identity problem. 
</P>
<P>
Idaho's John Friesz this year became only the eighth quarterback in NCAA 
history to pass for more than 4,000 yards in a season, but he's relatively 
unknown because he plays in Division I-AA. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to come into the Blue-Gray game and show the nation I can play 
football," said Friesz, fifth on the NCAA's all-time passing list with 10,697 
yards. "Playing in the Big Sky Conference, players don't always get the 
recognition they deserve. I hope I can change some of that."

ALOHA BOWL: NO. 22 SPARTANS FACE NO. 25 RAINBOWS IN HAWAII ON CHRISTMAS DAY.

Michigan State's strength and Hawaii's speed make the Aloha Bowl a tossup, 
Spartan Coach George Perles said. 
</P>
<P>
No. 22 Michigan State (7-4) plays No. 25 Hawaii (9-2-1) Christmas Day (12:30 
p.m. PST, Ch. 7) in a game that pits a Big Ten Conference power against the 
wide-open offense and tenacious defense of a Western Athletic Conference 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a little bit bigger on the line than some of their people -- not all of 
them," Perles said. "They're a little quicker. So it's a wash." 
</P>
<P>
"That's why they're calling it an intriguing matchup," Hawaii Coach Bob Wagner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans are seven-point favorites, but Perles said his team is not paying 
attention to oddsmakers. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't win the football game, it's not going to be because of the 
weather, it's not going to be because of the time zone, it's not going to be 
because of distractions," Perles said. "It's going to be because the University 
of Hawaii is a better football team." 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State, making its fifth bowl appearance in six years, brings a 
seasoned team. Its losses were all to nationally ranked teams -- Notre Dame, 
Miami (Fla.), Michigan and Illinois. It lost those games by 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
All-American linebacker Percy Snow, winner of the Lombardi and Butkus awards, 
anchors the Michigan State defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans allowed 13.6 points -- least in the Big Ten and sixth best in the 
nation. They ranked 11th in the nation in total defense, allowing 285.2 yards, 
and 11th against the rush with 100.8 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans are intimidating on offense as well, with All-American left tackle 
Bob Kula leading a line averaging 281 pounds. Behind them, tailback Blake Ezor 
averaged 124 yards, seventh best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii's "spread" offense, a run-and-shoot passing attack and option running 
game, should keep the Rainbows from having to run into the full force of 
Michigan State's stunt 4-3 defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll do all right because overall they're probably a bit larger than 
us, but I don't think they have the team speed or quickness we do," slot back 
Dane McArthur said. "It will be a real thinking game for our offense." 
</P>
<P>
The Rainbows, making their first bowl appearance, were fifth in the nation in 
scoring offense, with 38 points. They scored 60 points or more against three 
opponents and 56 in a rout of then-No. 18 Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
Garrett Gabriel finished 11th in the nation in passing efficiency. Running back 
Jamal Farmer, who won WAC newcomer and freshman of the year honors, set an NCAA 
record for most touchdowns by a freshman with 18. He gained 986 yards, 242 in 
Hawaii's season finale against Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like playing two teams," Perles said. "Normally a team that plays the 
option doesn't throw the ball well and vice versa. They do both, and that's why 
they have such an outstanding record." 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii led the WAC and was sixth in the nation in rushing defense, allowing an 
average of 96 yards. The Rainbows also led the WAC in total defense (320.2 
yards) and scoring defense (20.7 points). 
</P>
<P>
Although outsized by Michigan State's line, Hawaii's quickness could also be a 
factor on defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can match up with our speed," rover back David Maeva said. "We have 
to use that to our advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii will be without All-WAC nose guard Dana Directo, who suffered a 
herniated disk in his back.

Today among the most produced playwrights in this country, August Wilson left 
high school for the reading room of Pittsburgh's Carnegie Library. He held 
assorted odd jobs and wrote at night: poetry, short stories, and, finally, 
plays. When his play, "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom," was accepted for the 
prestigious Eugene O'Neill Theater Center's National Playwrights Conference in 
1982, then developed in regional theater en route to Broadway, black America 
acquired a powerful and poetic dramatic voice. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Paul-based storyteller, whose own grandmother walked from North 
Carolina to Pittsburgh, weaves together the contemporary black experience and 
its historical precedents. Turning out a play a year, the 44-year-old poet is 
chronicling black America decade by decade through this century. 
</P>
<P>
"Ma Rainey" was set in a Chicago recording studio in the '20s, "Fences" in 
black domestic life of the '50s, "Joe Turner's Come and Gone" in a Pittsburgh 
boardinghouse in 1911. All three won the New York Drama Critics Circle Award, 
while "Fences" also won the 1987 Pulitzer and four Tony awards. This season, 
there are 16 regional theaters presenting "Fences," making it the second most 
produced play on U.S. professional stages (after Dickens' "A Christmas Carol.") 
</P>
<P>
His newest play, "The Piano Lesson," is due at the Doolittle Theater here in 
mid-January. The Taste Makers project was edited by David Fox, assistant Sunday 
Calendar editor. BARBARA ISENBERG

FILM: THE PRODUCER AS KING

Hollywood underwent a major transformation in creative control in the '80s, 
spawning a new generation of powerhouse film producers. In fact, these shrewd, 
dominating new movie moguls operated with such a strong hand -- hiring and 
firing directors, packaging stars and even creating an aesthetic for their 
pictures -- that perhaps they should be known by a heady new moniker: the 
Producer as Auteur. 
</P>

'70s box-office champs Steven Spielberg and George Lucas still exercised 
considerable influence, especially through Spielberg's Amblin Films, which 
encouraged a host of young film-making talent. But the real '80's kingpins were 
a high-profile trio of producer teams: Don Simpson &amp; Jerry Bruckheimer, 
Lawrence Gordon &amp; Joel Silver and Peter Guber and John Peters. Not to say 
that these duos were infallible -- all presided over plenty of flops. But they 
created blockbuster hits with remarkable consistency, sculpted the career moves 
of budding superstars and -- for better or worse -- helped establish the 
supremacy of the sequel, giving studios access to a proven box-office 
commodity. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about building a franchise -- Simpson &amp; Bruckheimer preside over the 
"Beverly Hills Cop" series, Gordon &amp; Silver have "48 HRS." and "Die Hard" 
sequels in the works (while Silver oversees the "Lethal Weapon" series) and 
Guber-Peters left Warner Films in possession of a potential bonanza -- the 
"Batman" sequel. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, there have been influential producers who've chosen to work outside 
the action-movie genre. Having thrived as a writer-producer in the world of 
sit-com TV, James L. Brooks earned his directing stripes this decade (with 
"Terms of Endearment" and "Broadcast News"). But he also established his Gracie 
Films banner as a symbol of classy, creative films, producing such 
adventuresome fare as "The War of the Roses, "Big" and "Say Anything." Ed 
Pressman also proved that while independent production is ailing, it's not down 
for the count. During the decade he's nurtured such daring directors as Alex 
Cox, Fred Schepisi and the Taviani brothers while presiding over such intrepid 
works as David Byrne's "True Stories" and Oliver Stone's "Talk Radio."

If one film director captured the jagged edges of the 1980's, it was Oliver 
Stone. A graduate of both Vietnam and film school, he found himself in perfect 
sync with an overheated decade fueled by self-absorbed cynicism, a rampaging 
media and an unabashed lust for a buck. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Stone didn't hit his stride till mid-decade, his films, from 
"Salvador" and "Platoon" through "Wall Street" and "Talk Radio" have all 
plumbed the depths of the '80s self-dramatization and despair. Taking their 
cues from front-page headlines, Stone's moody, tumultuous films walk the thin 
line between outrage and outrageousness. "Salvador" sneered at Reagan-era 
Central American jingoism. "Wall Street" reveled in yuppie greed and power 
lust. "Talk Radio" offered a dark, nihilistic celebration of our fanatical 
obsession with celebrity. With his new film, "Born on the Fourth of July," 
Stone returns to his touchstone -- Vietnam -- which produced his biggest hit, 
"Platoon," and established his voice as a film maker always eager to explore 
the darkest recesses of our gaudy popular culture. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its blockbuster mentality, 1980's Hollywood somehow made room for other 
gifted movie makers. Woody Allen was more prolific than ever. And despite some 
failed attempts at more serious statements, America's most distinctive comic 
voice produced a wealth of film wonders, exploring showbiz memories ("Broadway 
Danny Rose" and "Radio Days"), delighting in cinematic trickery ("Zelig" and 
"Purple Rose of Cairo") and creating memorable new characters ("Hannah &amp; 
Her Sisters" and "Crimes and Misdemeanors"). Another holdover from the '70s, 
Martin Scorsese, was still in peak form, mesmirizing us with his syncopated 
cinematic rhythms and raw, pulp power. Teamed with Robert De Niro, he began the 
decade with two abrasive but intoxicating knock-out punches -- "Raging Bull" 
and "King of Comedy" -- and returned to form at decade's end with "The Last 
Temptation of Christ," another fascinating Scorsese meditation on faith and 
fevered dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood's mainstream wasn't in such bad shape either, especially with a 
steady diet of films from such talented craftsmen as Barry Levinson, Sidney 
Pollack, Lawrence Kasdan and the erratic (but always compelling) Brian de 
Palma. 
</P>
<P>
If the decade had an unsung -- or at least underrated -- director, it would 
probably be Robert Zemeckis. 
</P>
<P>
A Spielberg protege, Zemeckis is now on a par with his mentor, concocting 
cheeky, hyperactive comic-fables ("Who Framed Roger Rabbit," "Romancing the 
Stone" and the "Back to the Future" series) which have all been enormous 
box-office hits -- and escapist delights. Best of all, the late 80's spawned a 
string of Young Turks -- art-house wizard Jim Jarmusch, outspoken activist 
Spike Lee and dreamy visionary Tim Burton -- who have already esablished 
themselves as major cinema contenders for the '90s.

Bill Cosby was more than TV's biggest star of the 1980s. He changed the course 
of TV and had historic impact on the medium. 
</P>
<P>
He took one of TV's oldest formats, the family sitcom, gave a modern twist to 
"Father Knows Best" and, in one fell swoop, helped destroy decades of insulting 
black stereotypes on the home tube and in show business overall. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cosby Show" started as a longshot. When it debuted on Sept. 20, 1984, TV 
comedy -- especially with a family setting -- was considered dead. The biggest 
hits were soap operas like "Dallas" and "Dynasty" and action shows such as 
"Magnum, P.I." and "Simon &amp; Simon." 
</P>
<P>
But after the ratings success of "Cosby," family sitcoms blossomed again: 
"Family Ties," "Growing Pains," "Who's the Boss?", "The Wonder Years." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing was more important, however, than the dignified and natural portrayal 
of blacks through Cosby, as pediatrician Cliff Huxtable; Phylicia Rashad as his 
attorney-wife, Clair, and their children. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics carped that the Huxtable family was an unrealistic, idealized 
depiction of blacks -- as if "Father Knows Best," "My Three Sons" and "Family 
Ties" were any different for whites. 
</P>
<P>
Cosby had been a TV star previously in "I Spy." But what undoubtedly boosted 
his new popularity on his return to series TV was his public identification 
with educational and children's matters in private life and on the tube.

PAUL TAYLOR

<TEXT>
<P>
In a conservative, glamour-hungry decade that treated ballet as the Main Event, 
and modern dance as merely a sideshow, Paul Taylor (now 59) nevertheless became 
even more widely imitated as a choreographer. 
</P>
<P>
Not only did lesser artists continue to steal from his 1962 "Aureole" (a 
plotless showpiece that inspired a virtual modern-dance subgenre by setting 
frisky, all-American athleticism to Baroque music), but the dance-without-steps 
innovations of his 1975 "Esplanade" were robbed blind, repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
PBS helped broaden Taylor's influence and so did ballet companies -- though a 
badly shot Taylor work could look like an imitation, just as imitations and the 
real thing could turn up in the same ballet repertory. In 1986, the Joffrey 
even scheduled Taylor's 10-year-old "Cloven Kingdom" on mixed bills with Mark 
Haim's new, Tayloresque "Garden of Boboli." 
</P>
<P>
No matter. There was plenty more where that came from, starting in 1980 with 
"The Rehearsal," a wildly idiosyncratic silent-film-style gangster melodrama 
set to the two-piano arrangement of Stravinsky's "Le Sacre du Printemps." No 
longer mythic and timeless, this fabled, fearsome score now sounded jazzy, 
ironic, very much of its time -- though Taylor allowed references to the plot 
and even movement style of Vaslav Nijinsky's 1913 ballet to extend the work's 
frame of reference. For once, Taylor proved inimitable. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after came "Sunset," lush, lyrical, just as multilayered and sometimes 
acutely unsettling in its juxtapositions -- between Elgar and recorded loon 
calls, between nostalgic courtship rituals (soldiers and girls in a park) and 
premonitions of untimely death. 
</P>
<P>
Two more milestones appeared in the middle of the decade: the rhapsodic 
"Roses," which extended the range of male corps virtuosity into a new realm of 
dynamic sensitivity, and the unsparingly harsh social portrait "Last Look," 
about the aftermath of hedonism. 
</P>
<P>
Its expansion of gestural material into convulsive whole-body statements -- and 
its sense of communal despair -- pointed the way toward the sardonic, Jungian 
examinations of social fragmentation in Taylor's most recent work, especially 
"Speaking in Tongues." He remains a master. The edge in his work has never been 
sharper.

Grand opera may seem an unlikely arena for popular and commercial success as a 
composer these days, but that is where Philip Glass has done his most 
influential work, beginning with "Einstein on the Beach" in 1976. That 
ground-breaking collaboration with Robert Wilson was followed by two more 
"portrait operas" -- "Satyagraha" in 1980, "Ahknaten" in 1984 -- and a string 
of dramatic works large and small, produced around the world, up to the 
eco-opera "Mattogrosso" last July. 
</P>
<P>
The composer -- who will be 53 next month -- has created a large crossover 
audience through exploitation of now classic minimalist devices presented with 
the glossy amplified sheen of pop energy and production values. 
</P>
<P>
Glass' music is direct and insistent, built on oscillating arpeggios and scales 
in neo-modal progressions. It is a plastic, highly colored, dramatically 
adaptable music, which Glass has used most effectively in theater, film and 
dance scores. Its technical basis is easily grasped, which has earned it slurs 
in some quarters, ready imitation in others. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are no future plans for "Mattogrosso" and "The Palace of the 
Arabian Nights" has been postponed indefinitely, his star will shine into the 
'90s. A national tour of "Einstein on the Beach" planned for 1991 may reach Los 
Angeles, Stuttgart will offer the portrait operas as a trilogy, and the Met has 
commissioned "The Voyage" -- celebrating the 500th anniversary of Columbus' 
first journey to the Americas -- for October 1992.

Using ballet as his launching pad, this restlessly adventurous artist (now 41) 
redefined dance-star versatility in the '80s through his involvement in movies, 
television and, finally, the legitimate (non-dance) stage -- and by testing 
himself against more movement idioms than seemed possible or even wise. 
</P>
<P>
From Martha Graham modernism in the theater to the finale of "A Chorus Line" on 
TV, and from the Red-baiting melodrama of the "White Nights" movie hit to the 
periodic reminders that this was the greatest Albrecht of our lives, 
Baryshnikov triumphed. 
</P>
<P>
Even his failures loomed large: the sexual and directorial inadequacies that 
Gelsey Kirkland detailed in her best-selling book "Dancing on My Grave" and the 
grandiose image-mongering of the movie "Dancers," with its ads showing 
Baryshnikov and his filmic love interest, Julie Kent, in roughly the same 
size-ratio as King Kong and Fay Wray. 
</P>
<P>
Barynishikov influenced tastes, all right, but not always positively. By 
example and instruction he undoubtedly upgraded the standard of classical 
dancing at American Ballet Theatre during his time as director. However, in his 
regime the company also grew increasingly irresponsible toward classical 
choreography. Indeed, Baryshnikov's ABT became a source of fake antiques, with 
his recent "Swan Lake" typifying the patchwork of styles at its most ruinous. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, as a leader and the most visible personality in dance, couldn't 
Baryshnikov have done a lot more, a lot sooner, to combat the dance world's 
widespread denial concerning both drug abuse and the AIDS crisis?

As his star rose in the '80s, this consistently innovative and remarkably 
humane actor-dancer (now 43) became a symbol of the Tap Revival, one of the 
decade's happiest cultural reclamation projects. Hines' style of tap, however, 
was disarmingly earthy, streetwise, personal and distinctly of the moment -- 
without the painted smiles, oily audience courting and facile virtuosity that 
had placed tap specialists on the Endangered Species list. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in the audition scene of "Tap" (the movie), Hines made a federal case 
out of not smiling, just as in the jailhouse solo early in the film -- and the 
climactic "murder" solo in "The Cotton Club" -- he unleashed a brooding, 
improvisational, ultimately cathartic style. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he could look almost conventionally elegant and nonchalant when required: 
in the Broadway revue "Sophisticated Ladies," early in the decade, for 
instance, or in a supersuave duet with Tommy Tune on a PBS "Dance in America" 
episode just this year. But those achievements were in homage to the past while 
his rebellious, rock-era approach to tap in the movie "White Nights" arguably 
reached out to a whole new audience. 
</P>
<P>
He had two daring solos -- one emotionally explosive, the other spatially 
extravagant -- that gave his character a dimension missing in the screenplay 
and confirmed that he had become one of the great dancers of our time.

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps the crystallizing moment of Bruce Springsteen's incredible success came 
during the 1984 presidential campaign, when "Born in the U.S.A." fever was at 
its almost Beatlemania-like peak, when concert tickets were like gold ducats 
for bankers and auto workers alike -- when no less a luminary than the 
President himself chose to quote the lyrics of this humble symbol of the 
working class from Joisey. A moment to make Mama Springsteen proud, perhaps, 
but a moment to tick off millions of fans who knew that the Commander in Chief 
had it all wrong, terribly wrong; that the outwardly celebratory, inwardly grim 
"U.S.A." album was a product of -- but hardly a patriotic tract for -- the 
Reagan Era. 
</P>
<P>
The President wasn't the only one to just not get it, nor was he the only one 
to attempt to co-opt the amazing Populism that Springsteen represents. Pop acts 
from pathetic mimic John Cafferty on up to fellow do-gooder John Cougar 
Mellencamp would scarcely exist in their present form if not for Brooooce. The 
neo-folk movement in rock, too, might not be with us if not for the impact of 
the all-acoustic "Nebraska" album, which, unlike "Born in the U.S.A.," made no 
attempt to sweeten its downbeat Americana themes and Woody Guthrie-like 
broadsides. 
</P>
<P>
Springsteen first became a star in the '70s, but only in the '80s did he become 
something that everyone needed a piece of, from the GOP to the tabloids.

In May of 1981, at a long-forgotten Los Angeles club known as the Maiden 
Voyage, Wynton Marsalis emerged with Art Balkey's Jazz Messengers. He was 
promptly hailed as a 19-year-old discovery and potential star of the 1980s; but 
there was more to it than that; more, in fact, that he had already 
accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-aged wonder, we soon learned, had racked up several years of classical 
and jazz credits in his native New Orleans; moreover, he was a member of a 
unique family, three of whose members have since become nationally celebrated: 
father Ellis Marsalis, older brother Branford, and his younger brother 
Delfeayo. 
</P>
<P>
Wynton Marsalis has become a symbol of a musical life style of the 1980s. He 
has helped, more than any musician who preceded him, to break down idiomatic 
boundaries that had too long existed in music. At the same time he has 
spearheaded a move toward acoustic, unhyphenated jazz at a time when fusion 
seemed to be taking precedence.

MICHAEL JACKSON

<P>
Forget the wacko image . . . the oxygen tank . . . the Elephant Man's bones . . 
. the menagerie . . . and the tabloid-headline links with Diana Ross, Brooke 
Shields, Liz Taylor and Bubbles the chimp. 
</P>
<P>
They all may be part of the formula used by Michael Jackson to so intrigue the 
public that he ended up as Vanity Fair magazine's Celebrity-of-the-'80s. But 
the real reason this manchild reached his promised land in the '80s was his 
music and electrifying presence. 
</P>
<P>
Manchild he is. On the man side, Jackson's leap from child prodigy to the pop 
innovator of "Thriller" was unprecedented (save perhaps for that of Stevie 
Wonder). Combining that originality with his imaginative command of the new 
music video form, Jackson virtually redefined the concept of a pop star in the 
early '80s, not to mention the concept of album sales: "Thriller" has sold more 
than any other album in history -- 40 million copies worldwide, its successor 
"Bad" "only" 20 million. 
</P>
<P>
In the process he created a new "sound of Young America," every bit as 
pervasive (and ultimately color-blind) as the Motown sound in which he was 
nurtured. It's hard to believe he released only two albums during the decade. 
There wouldn't even be a New Kids on the Block without Jackson's inventions. 
</P>
<P>
On the child side, the 31-year-old Jackson was the Peter Pan of the '80s, 
living his heroic fantasies as he saved the world from gang wars (the "Beat It" 
and "Bad" videos) and intergalactic evil ("Captain EO"). On the surface the 
roles seem ludicrous: a shy, frail young man with the money (not to mention the 
stunning dance moves) to give form to his daydreams. But the pop world followed 
it all with almost pathological interest. When Michael wore just one glove, so 
did kids around the world.

Letterman is our last TV anti-hero. He came along at a time when the talk show 
format had grown bankrupt and no one wanted to admit it. The talk show wasn't 
about real conversation and the individual features of character, it was about 
self-promotion and plugola, and his new "Late Night With David Letterman" 
instantly took on the refreshingly uncertain edge of self-parody. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the tastelessness and exploitiveness has been trimmed from the show 
since its debut, but there's still just enough of a kernel of self-hate in 
Letterman to insure that he'll never quite believe his success, and therefore 
he'll never be its victim. 
</P>
<P>
Now the talk show genre is back with a vengeance as Oprah and Donahue and 
Geraldo and Sally Jessy sort through the American laundry in a renewed format 
that exposes just what a lonely place America can be. Lonely and loud and 
tacky. Letterman loves tacky, and he still has a soft spot in his heart for the 
human zoo. But there isn't a lot of nourishment in his format. How long can he 
keep going?

<P>
Riding high on the airwaves, Garrison Keillor consumed the imagination of much 
of the nation on Saturday nights through the decade with his generally dry, 
sometimes solemn, but invariably gentle satire. 
</P>
<P>
Even though radio had long been declared brain dead, Keillor's "A Prairie Home 
Companion," dispatched out of Minnesota, brought it back to a new life, at 
least during those two hours of variety entertainment and Keillor's heartful 
tales from the folks of Lake Wobegon. It all ended in 1987, when the show 
finished its 13-year run. 
</P>
<P>
We will never be able to dispell the image of the Chatterbox Inn and Ralph's 
Pretty Good Grocery and Jack's Auto Repair, to which all tracks lead. He gave 
new meaning to shyness and reticence and Powermilk Biscuits. 
</P>
<P>
In the hearts of many of us, Norwegian bachelor farmers have a special place. 
In fact, Norwegians in general are now held in special esteem for their 
self-effacements. As Keillor defines their attitude toward life, "Nobody's 
killed us yet so far as we know." 
</P>
<P>
Through his books, including the enormously successful "Lake Wobegon Days," and 
his jottings in the New Yorker and other publications, plus a new incantation 
of his radio program now sent out of New York, Keillor has become a landmark on 
the American cultural landscape, right up there with apple pie and Dr Pepper.

LARRY KING

</HEADLINE>

Larry King was -- and is -- a media man for all seasons. Wherever America 
looked or listened during the 1980s, King was there . . . and usually with him 
were the men and women whose celebrity, dynamism, wit and wisdom defined the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons he is even loathe to explain, King is one of a handful of media 
interviewers who seems to be able to make everyone from country singers to 
contract killers feel comfortable. There is a secret to it of sorts: Larry King 
pulls his punches. He doesn't profess to be a journalist. He doesn't go into an 
interview with pretensions of exposing or embarrassing a guest. That reputation 
has given even the most wary celebrity a sense of safety in facing Larry King. 
He remains the only major media maven to get a one-on-one interview with Frank 
Sinatra whose hate affair with the press dates back more than 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his nightly radio show, aired over the Mutual Radio Network on 
more stations than any other talk program in the country (heard locally over 
KFI-AM), King's musings are to found in a regular column in USA Today, a 
nightly hour of interviews over the Cable News Network; and in three 
best-selling books. 
</P>
<P>
At 55, King shows no signs of slacking the pace on his other ongoing programs, 
despite a heart attack three years ago. His most recent book is testimony to 
Larry King the survivor. "Mr. King, You're Having a Heart Attack" (Delacorte, 
1989) covers his chain-smoking, Type A behavior throughout the first two-thirds 
of the decade and the switch he had to make in life style following bypass 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
In that way alone, King was typical of a nation that learned about the benefits 
of exercise and the results of tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse during the 
1980s.

It took a long time for Johnny Carson and NBC to come up with a successor to 
The Tonight Show chair. There was a real constituency to consider, one that 
reached from the urban coasts to the heartland, to whom the show performed the 
ritual function of smoothing out the tensions of the workaday world like 
bedsheets. They needed someone sharp enough to put things in comedic 
perspective and amiable enough to leave an audience comfortably on the 
threshold of sleep. Jay Leno took to the job so well that he seemed the most 
natural choice in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Leno was so singleminded about his career in the mid-'70s that he was willing 
to sleep on the steps behind the Comedy Store (occasionally a sympathetic cop 
would buy him coffee and doughnuts). Nothing about the current ease and 
apparent freshness of his act now reveals the dogged and meticulous years he 
spent assembling the elements of comedy presentation. 
</P>
<P>
The memory of hard times in an individual often goes a long way towards taking 
the measure of current success, but it can work the other way too, making one 
pig out on celebrity. Leno's topical skepticism is tonic, as is his coverage of 
the ways in which we're manipulated and exploited by advertising, the media, 
and some of the people we place in public trust. He has an eye for the 
preposterous within the everyday. He uses language and imagery well. He works 
clean. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, he has a realistic perspective on what it means to be an entertainer -- 
he knows the traps as well as the trappings of success. That's why he's out on 
the road when he could just as well stay home poolside. He's one of the few 
major comedians on the scene who hasn't had his work ethic retrofitted around a 
world of show-biz values.

 CALARTS ALUMNI

<TEXT>
<P>
"The revival of Conceptual Art in the last five years can be traced to some 
extent to CalArts graduates who moved to New York," said journalist Richard B. 
Woodward in a recent article in the New York Times. "CalArts students have 
swarmed over both coasts like a pack of elite professional soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
Like the Bauhaus in the '30s, Los Angeles' California Institute of the Arts 
revolutionized art school in the '80s. A small private academy located in the 
Valencia area, CalArts took higher learning out of the ivory tower and into the 
marketplace. A theoretically rigorous school that emphasized idea over craft, 
CalArts trained students to talk about their art with sophistication (how to 
deliver a sales pitch in other words), and considers it a central 
responsibility to enlighten young artists to the harsher realities of the art 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Drilling their students to be media savvy, CalArts has been faulted for 
producing artists whose sense of careerism takes precedence over all else, but 
you can't argue with results. Prominently featured in all the Whitney Biennals 
of the '80s, CalArts graduates also dominated MOCA's recent "Forest of Signs" 
exhibition -- 11 of the 30 artists in the show graduated from the school. Among 
CalArts thriving alumni are Matt Mullican, Mike Kelley, Barbara Bloom, Ross 
Bleckner, Troy Brauntuch, Eric Fishl, David Salle and Ashley Bickerton. 
</P>
<P>
Artist John Baldessari is widely credited with shaping the school's aesthetic 
(he recently left his post there), but he had help. Michael Asher and Douglas 
Huebler are major campus gurus, and the roster of artists who've taught there 
is a who's who of contemporary culture. Jonathan Borofsky, Ravi Shankar, Laurie 
Anderson, Susan Rothenberg, Bruce Nauman, Nam June Paik, Elizabeth Murray, 
Sherrie Levine, Roberto Rossellini, Judy Pfaff and Barbara Kruger all did 
stints there. 
</P>
<P>
CalArts' days as the the country's leading art think tank may be numbered, 
however. The CalArts aesthetic currently dominates the art world, so a 
stylistic insurrection is bound to be brewing someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
And, as art critic Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe observes (having taught at the school 
for several years), "CalArts was once an alternative, but it's now become the 
academy." KRISTINE McKENNA

THE BEST FILMS OF '89 -- THE CRITICS' CHOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you were to do a caricature of the 1989 film year it would be pear-shaped, 
narrow at the top, broadening slightly in the middle, with all the weight at 
the bottom. For a while, as we slogged our way through "Gleaming the Cube," 
"Her Alibi," "Who's Harry Crumb," "Pet Semetary," "Loverboy" or "Fletch Lives," 
it was a grind. There would never be light at the end of the tunnel and no way 
to frame the same discouraging words, over and over. 
</P>
<P>
Then slowly, the more interesting films began to surface, films that were 
clearly made with some purpose behind them other than to tread dutifully in the 
footsteps of a proven moneymaker. Some of these were "Powwow Highway," "High 
Hopes," "Little Vera," "84 Charlie Mopic;" plus a few more that were pure 
enjoyment: "36 Fillette" and "Some Girls." 
</P>
<P>
The thaw may have taken longer to arrive than almost any year of the past 10, 
but it finally came mid-year, with "Dead Poets Society," "When Harry Met Sally 
. . . ," "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," "A Taxing Woman Returns," and 
"Parenthood." 
</P>
<P>
Then in this last three months, we've had a deluge: "Breaking In," "The Story 
of Women," "Sidewalk Stories," "Mystery Train," "Little Mermaid," "Mala Noce," 
"True Love," "The War of the Roses," "Blaze," "Triumph of the Spirit," "Glory," 
and "Driving Miss Daisy," enough to turn a mediocre year into a very creditable 
one indeed. 
</P>
<P>
What 1989 may have proved is that stars are nice insurance, but if your film is 
compelling enough, a great ensemble can carry it. Think of "Do the Right 
Thing," "Sidewalk Stories," "True Love," "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen," 
or "Distant Voices, Still Lives." On the other hand, a film may make its own 
stars: thus, James Spader, Andie MacDowell, Peter Gallagher and Laura San 
Giacomo from "sex, lies and videotape"; Kelly Lynch, taken seriously at last 
after "Drugstore Cowboy"; Casey Siemaszko and Sheila Kelley in "Breaking In"; 
Natalia Negoda in "Little Vera," or Kenneth Branagh in "Henry V." 
</P>
<P>
If there was a hopeful sign to be read from among the litter of these used 
ticket stubs, it's the astonishingly high percentage of fine, first-time 
directors on the scene this year. In fact, more than half of the list that 
follows are debut films, and many of those are by writer-directors, an alliance 
that seems to underline a personal stamp. 
</P>
<P>
So without more preamble, let us get to that list: 
</P>
<P>
1. "Enemies, A Love Story" How do some of us escape from under the shadow of 
profound calamity, while others founder? Isaac Bashevis Singer, the master 
storyteller, probes the question, and Paul Mazursky, in the best film of his 
career, gives it form, deep understanding and a cast so good as to seem the 
only one possible: Anjelica Huston, Ron Silver, Lena Olin and Margaret Sophie 
Stein. Amazing that this material can be as dryly humorous as this, but it is 
-- oh, how it is. 
</P>
<P>
2. "Distant Voices, Still Lives" The most painfully personal of this personal 
crop, Terence Davies' memory film takes a World War II childhood spent under 
the domination of a terrifying father in an unremarkable Liverpool row house, 
and makes mesmerizing poetry of it. And just as you think you know every move 
he's likely to make, Davies creates a scene of such shocking beauty that it 
takes your breath away. 
</P>
<P>
3. "Do the Right Thing" Spike Lee's behind-the-scenes tour of the sources of a 
racial conflagration in Brooklyn's Bed-Stuy is the coming-of-age announcement 
of an already assured talent. Weaving the threads of his story in and around 
this long-standing racially mixed community, Lee creates three generations of 
characters, each drawn with a brilliant ear for speech -- like the Corner Men 
or the owner and proprietor of Sal's Famous Pizzeria -- and caught with a 
sinuous, inventive camera. With all deference to the film that follows, this is 
the one that wuz robbed at Cannes. 
</P>
<P>
4. "sex, lies and videotape" Steven Soderberg has made the funniest, the wisest 
and certainly the most compelling film yet dealing with the young, contemporary 
upward-bound scene. Half of its hypnotic power comes from its gaze at the very 
private lives of its two couples; the other half comes from MacDowell, Spader, 
San Giacomo and Gallagher. The work is wickedly assured, puncturingly witty. 
</P>
<P>
5. "My Left Foot" If director Jim Sheridan had been even the least sentimental 
in his story of the Irish writer, painter and poet Christy Brown, who had only 
the use of one foot in a body given over to cerebral palsy, this might have 
been one of those treacly "triumph of the human spirit" cliches. Instead, it is 
a tight, tough-minded movie, blazing with grand performances, the most 
remarkable of which is Daniel Day-Lewis' as Christy -- ribald, demanding and 
triumphant. 
</P>

6. "Drugstore Cowboy" Fascinating what director Gus Van Sant has done in this 
account of an amazingly dense Seattle-based gang of dopers. He manages to 
create the warm, stupid euphoria that is the drugged state, without for a 
second making it alluring. Funny and brilliantly acted, especially by Matt 
Dillon and Kelly Lynch, it's also a tragic love story told with beautiful 
visual style by one of cinema's mainstream post-modernists. 
</P>
<P>
7. "The Fabulous Baker Boys" One of the wittiest and most sensual of the year's 
stash of comedies, this one was given extra panache by the fabulous Bridges 
boys and the screen's current siren, Michelle Pfeiffer. Steve Kloves is a 
genially uninsistent director, pushing nothing, sure that we get all the 
nuances of his cheerfully unhousebroken film about the pangs and bonds of 
brotherhood and the sort-of-awful world of cocktail lounge piano, and we 
certainly do. 
</P>
<P>
8. "Henry V" Actor/director Kenneth Branagh's "Henry" is Shakespeare for 
today's world. It has a king who is intelligent, canny and cruel when he needs 
to be, and a post-Falklands view of warfare as muddy, reeking carnage that will 
all come to the same end eventually, no matter who carries the victory today. 
Stocked with the cream of British theater, this is a young, nervy production, 
clearly done on a budget but able to soar when it must. You might wish 
Branagh's palette were a little less liver-colored, but perhaps only if, like 
me, the brilliant blues and whites of the Olivier version were burned into your 
memory at an impressionable age. 
</P>
<P>
9. "Roger &amp; Me" Lively, mean-spirited fun in a good cause awaits you as 
Michael Moore's documentary crew pursues the man whose company shuttered 
Moore's hometown of Flint, Mich., when it closed down the General Motors 
plants. You'd make a fatal mistake if you took Moore for the rube he pretends 
to be, and you may wince at his treatment of his "cast," especially the bunny 
lady, but Moore certainly has a nice anarchic eye and a highly developed sense 
of the ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
10. "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" You don't have to be a child or a 
little mad to wallow in the sumptuous invention of Terry Gilliam's epic fairy 
tale. When you hear that threadbare phrase, they don't make movies like that 
any more, "Munchausen" is the that. Gilliam's frame of reference is like an 
unabashed art history lesson and you are not going to have a more romantic 
moment this year than the sight of the Baron and Venus herself, waltzing around 
and around and finally up into the air, circling the walls of a semi-ruined 
castle. This, and every other bit of splendor, is magic for every age.

Willem Dafoe tackles his first romantic comedy opposite Joan Cusack in 
Paramount's "Arrive Alive." Jeremiah S. Chechik, enjoying the current success 
of "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation," will direct this tale about a 
detective and a stripper written by Michael O'Donahue and Mitch Glazer. Filming 
will get underway in Florida the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
Despite rewrites by William Goldman, Warren Beatty wouldn't commit to "Misery," 
Rob Reiner's film for Castle Rock and Columbia. So James Caan is now signed to 
star opposite Broadway actress Kathy Bates. Filming of the psychological 
cat-and-mouse tale, based on the novel by Stephen King about a best-selling 
author held capture by a fan, begins Feb. 5 in Genoa, Nev., and Los Angeles . . 
. Meanwhile, Julia Roberts takes over the role Kim Basinger turned down in 
Fox's thriller "Sleeping With the Enemy," directed by Joseph Ruben and produced 
by Leonard Goldberg. Shooting begins in February, possibly in Northern 
California. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Haing S. Ngor, Oscar winner for "The Killing Fields," is one of the 
"Knights of War," a $7 million production from American First Run Studios, 
based on "Phu Nham," a novel written 10 years ago by the late 
songwriter-soldier Barry Sadler. Elliot Silverstein ("Cat Ballou") will direct 
Charles Hairston's script which, like the book, is based on a true story about 
a challenge duel during the Vietnam war between an American and Viet Cong 
soldier. Max and Micheline Keller will produce. Shooting is tentatively 
scheduled to begin in April. . . . 
</P>
<P>
John Candy, Dan Aykroyd and Jim Belushi have agreed to cameo appearances in 
"Masters of Menace," as a salute to their old Second City pal, Tino Insana, the 
film's writer. The biker comedy from CineTel Films, directed by Dan Raskov, 
also stars Catherine Bach, David Rasche, Lee "Ving" James and Insana. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dom DeLuise heads down under to star with Austen Tayshus -- reputed to be the 
most banned comic in Australia -- in "Cop-Outs," a comedy for producer-writer 
Lance Peters about the two worst cops in the world. Philippe Mora ("Communion") 
directs for Underworld Prods. Pty. Ltd. in Sydney in April . . . Then, in 
November, Mora will reteam with "Communion" author Whitley Strieber for the 
screen adaptation of Strieber's best-seller "Majestic," concerning an alleged 
UFO landing in New Mexico in 1947. . . . 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco film maker Rob Nilsson ("Northern Light," "On the Edge") has 
signed to direct Gibraltar Releasing's "Crime Lords," an action-adventure set 
in the Far East, filming early next year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Directions International has purchased film rights to Ron Arias' recently 
published book, "Five Against the Sea: A True Story of Courage and Survival." 
The company plans to film this true story of Costa Rican fishermen lost at sea 
for 142 days in 1988 under the title "Miracle at Sea." KIRK HONEYCUTT

<TEXT>
<P>
The 1980s provided Hollywood with some inspiring comeback stories: Dennis 
Hopper, Dean Stockwell, Cher, Sean Connery, Don Ameche, Jodie Foster, Farrah 
Fawcett, Richard Dreyfuss, Bette Midler, Mia Farrow. And the decade's Ultimate 
Comeback Kid -- John Travolta. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, the decade's end also leaves some performers contemplating 
comebacks. Here are a few that may have you scratching your head, wondering, 
"What have they done lately?" 
</P>
<P>
JENNIFER BEALS: She welded by day, danced by night -- and made torn sweatshirts 
a fashion craze when she starred in "Flashdance" (1983). Just 18, Beals 
appeared headed for superstardom. Instead, she headed for Yale -- graduating 
with honors in 1987 -- and married independent film maker Alexandre Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people ask me where I've been," admitted Beals, speaking from West 
Berlin, where she's starring opposite Alan Bates in director Claude Chabrol's 
"Dr. M." "I don't find it bothersome. It's sort of a natural question. It's not 
like they're accusing me of mass murder or anything." 
</P>
<P>
Since "Flashdance," she's been seen in only three films: "The Bride" (1985), 
"Split Decisions" (1988) and the recent flop "Vampire's Kiss." 
</P>
<P>
But next year, she'll be back in director Sam Fuller's "The Madonna and the 
Dragon." And she's just been set to co-star with Marlee Matlin in the drama "A 
Reasonable Doubt." 
</P>
<P>
ROBERT BLAKE: A major TV star ("Baretta") in the 1970s, Blake was last seen as 
a crime-fighting priest in NBC's short-lived "Hell Town" (1985). 
</P>
<P>
"I decided I didn't want to fall over dead like some of my friends . . . so I 
decided to quit for awhile," he told us. "I felt awful, looked raggedy. I was 
doing jobs I didn't want, making money I didn't need, working for people I 
didn't respect." 
</P>
<P>
Now 56, he added, "I'm getting ready to go back, as a matter of fact." 
</P>
<P>
Any projects to announce? 
</P>
<P>
"Talk is cheap. If I do it, you'll hear about it. If I don't, you won't. And 
that's the name of that tune." 
</P>
<P>
CHRISTOPHER ATKINS: He shot to fame in a loincloth opposite Brooke Shields in 
"The Blue Lagoon" (1980), but slipped quickly to exploitative roles -- like the 
part of a male stripper in "A Night in Heaven" (1983) -- and low-budgeters that 
"he did for quick money -- but shouldn't have," admitted his current manager, 
Nick Thomas. Then there was the 1983-84 season of "Dallas," which cast him as 
Sue Ellen's lifeguard lover -- "always with his shirt off." 
</P>
<P>
A two-year hiatus followed, with "some time (spent) at a rehabilitation center 
for alcohol and substance abuse," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Now 28, married, father of two, Atkins recently starred in a feature, "Fatal 
Charm," as "the boy-next-door -- who's not as nice as he seems. . . ." It's due 
next year, while Atkins looks for more roles "that will allow him to do 
something besides take his shirt off," Thomas added. 
</P>
<P>
MILES O'KEEFFE: He swung into view as Tarzan, opposite Bo Derek's Jane, in 
"Tarzan the Ape Man" (1981). Then the muscular actor headed for 
sword-and-sorcery terrain, starring in a string of mostly European-made pics 
like "Ator" (1983), "Sword of the Valiant" (1984) and "Iron Warrior" (1987). 
Plus a dramatic turn in the recent thriller "The Drifter" (1988). 
</P>
<P>
He'll next be seen in "So Cool," an actioner with Lou Ferrigno, due out next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been busy working, is all," he said of his career since "Tarzan," 
unwilling to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
CHAD EVERETT: "It hasn't been a wonderful decade, but it hasn't been that bad, 
either," said the one-time "Medical Center" star. "I don't delude myself, but 
after 30 years in this business, I'm pretty calm about it. I know that it works 
in cycles and mine is coming around again." 
</P>
<P>
Everett's last series was NBC's "The Rousters" (1983). Since then, there have 
been a few TV movies and low-budget features. Everett's currently awaiting word 
from ABC on a possible series pickup of "Thunderbolt Row," a Stephen J. Cannell 
MOW that garnered good ratings last month (the network ordered six scripts). 
And he's talking other projects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
MIKE DOUGLAS: Douglas, whose long-running, syndicated TV talk show went off the 
air in 1981, followed it with a two-year stint on CNN. Since, he's been playing 
golf and "doing a lot of speaking engagements -- town halls, women's clubs, 
that kind of stuff," said his manager, Kal Ross. A couple of syndication 
possibilities are in the talking stage, including a five-days-a-week "strip" 
that would be produced in Canada, formatted "just like the old Mike Douglas 
show." 
</P>
<P>
Also in the works: An album of Mike singing favorite tunes, to be sold with 
"heavy TV advertising" and an 800 number, "probably in the spring." 
</P>
<P>
LARRY WILCOX: "You get an enormous feeling of insecurity when you go from 
making $50,000 a week to nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox got that feeling in 1982 when NBC's "CHiPs" ended a six-year run. He 
entered a wide range of business ventures, with varying success. Already a 
producer with NBC's "Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story" before 
"CHiPs" ceased production, Wilcox has produced some 30 episodes of "The Ray 
Bradbury Theater" for HBO and USA cable so far. 
</P>
<P>
Of his acting career: "I think I mis-marketed myself as an actor. I came off as 
Billy Bland and people thought I couldn't do anything but ride a motorcycle." 
</P>
<P>
He's developing a long list of potential TV projects, including an 
already-scripted "CHiPs" reunion movie he expects to produce for NBC next year. 
And he stars in Aaron Spelling's upcoming two-hour movie, "Rich Men, Single 
Women," for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
ERIK ESTRADA: He doesn't mind stepping back into his old "CHiPs" boots for the 
planned TV reunion movie. "I like Ponce, I miss him." But Estrada laughingly 
admitted he's fought his series image -- "the guy with teeth" -- since the show 
ended, and now purposely looks for "bad man roles." 
</P>
<P>
Estrada co-starred in "True West" Off-Broadway when the series finished, then 
headed to Europe, acting in foreign movies and playing the celeb tennis 
circuit. He's since kept busy with low-budget independent movies ("Twisted 
Justice," upcoming), episodic TV and TV movies. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been tough," he admits, but he's edged back into the big time, playing an 
attorney in Golden Harvest's $22-million "Show of Force," with Robert Duvall 
and Amy Irving. It's due next year. 
</P>
<P>
IRENE CARA: A member of the cast of "Roots: The Next Generation" (1979), Cara 
was 21 when she became a standout in "Fame" (1980). Three years later, she won 
an Oscar for writing the title tune to "Flashdance." She also won a Grammy as 
best female vocalist in 1984. But acting-wise, things declined: the same year, 
she co-starred with Tatum O'Neal in the lurid actioner "A Certain Fury." 
</P>
<P>
Then, "Busted Up" (1986) and "Caged in Paradiso" (1988). 
</P>
<P>
Her career lately has been mostly musical: a 1987 album for Elektra, 
"Carasmatic," and a teaming with Freddy Jackson for the song, "Love Survives," 
from the animated movie "All Dogs Go to Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
But 1990 could be her comeback year as an actress: her rep claims that 
contracts will soon be finalized for what will be "the biggest role of her 
life." A source tips us it's the long talked-about film bio of Josephine Baker. 
</P>
<P>
ERIN MORAN: Joanie Cunningham for a decade ending in 1984 -- first on ABC's 
"Happy Days," then "Joanie Loves Chachi" -- Moran is currently out of acting. 
"She's been working on music with her husband (Rocky Ferguson)," said her 
business manager. "That's about it." 
</P>
<P>
MARTIN HEWITT: "I'm a working actor -- I'm just not working a lot." In fact, 
admitted Hewitt, now 32, he spends more time at carpentry. 
</P>
<P>
An unknown when he was cast as Brooke Shields' obsessed boyfriend in "Endless 
Love" (1981), he's since starred in a handful of low-budget features. Aiming 
now for small, meaty roles, he played the up-tight fiance of a Southern belle 
in "Two Moon Junction" (1988), and a young priest in a two-part episode of 
ABC's "Father Dowling Mysteries." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not box office," Hewitt acknowledged. "I can't get leads in quality films. 
But I am holding out for small roles (in quality films), so that I can build up 
some credits. I'm being selective, because I want to go the distance." 
</P>
<P>
AL CORLEY: During "Dynasty's" 1981-82 season, Corley broke ground as Steven, 
gay son of patriarch Blake Carrington. But when he complained -- in print -- 
that he wasn't being given enough to do, he was replaced by Jack Coleman. A 
much-publicized affair with singer-songwriter Carly Simon followed -- as well 
as his own music career. 
</P>
<P>
Corley, now 31, writes, plays the music and sings on three PolyGram albums that 
have spawned hits in Europe. It was during an overseas tour that he met German 
actress Jessika Cardinahl -- who became his wife. They have two kids. 
</P>
<P>
Corley works on the New York stage, has made two movies in Europe and is 
developing film and theater projects. 
</P>
<P>
His only regret about his acrimonious "Dynasty" split are the good roles he's 
missed: "I think I'm a really good actor. But so far, I haven't had the 
opportunity to prove it to Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
SANDAHL BERGMAN: She was impossible not to notice in the "Airotica" dance 
number in Bob Fosse's "All That Jazz" (1979) and likewise cut an imposing 
figure in "Conan the Barbarian" (1982). Then Bergman lent her physicality to a 
string of low-budget action-adventures. Now, said manager Ron Glaser, "We're 
regrouping." 
</P>
<P>
Bergman's done some episodic TV -- "Moonlighting," "Cheers" -- and is currently 
trying to develop some non-action properties. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to show her in a new light," Glaser said. "Everyone thinks of her 
as this 6-foot bodybuilder. Well, she's 5-foot-7 and she doesn't lift weights." 
</P>
<P>
LENNY VON DOHLEN: "You can't get much better than 'Tender Mercies,' " said Von 
Dohlen, who made his screen debut in the 1983 film as the wide-eyed leader of a 
youthful group of musicians. Then came "Electric Dreams" (1984), in which he 
starred. He's made only two films since: "Billy Galvin" (1988) and "Dracula's 
Widow" (1988), the latter "one that you do to pay the rent." 
</P>
<P>
A New Yorker, aged 30, he's racked up extensive stage credits, and done some 
episodic TV. Next up: a one-man show, in which he'd play Russian poet 
Mayakovsky, with "several theaters interested." 
</P>
<P>
His goal: "A career with longevity." 
</P>
<P>
DENNIS CHRISTOPHER: Looking back on his "ride aboard the famemobile" after 
grabbing attention as the lead in "Breaking Away" (1979), Christopher reflected 
that he "probably didn't have the emotional maturity to handle it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Despite solid film, TV and theater credits, the offers slowed down by the 
mid-'80s. He turned to working in foreign and avant-garde films and doing legit 
theater work. This year, he completed two independent features for upcoming 
release -- "Circuitry Man" and "Dead Women in Lingerie" -- and "Remember Me," a 
radio play set for KCRW airing in March. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks his career downswing may be a blessing, "because I've grown as a 
person and as an actor." 
</P>
<P>
BESS ARMSTRONG: After getting her start in the 1977-78 CBS sitcom "On Our Own," 
Armstrong made a splash in features -- "The Four Seasons" (1981) and "High Road 
to China" (1983). She also starred in ABC's 1985 miniseries "Lace" and appeared 
in several TV movies and a short-lived 1986 NBC sitcom, "All Is Forgiven." But 
her career appeared to inexplicably fade in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
One reason was the birth and short life of a severely disabled daughter for 
Armstrong and her producer-husband, John Fiedler. They have since become the 
parents of a "healthy and darling" 2-year-old boy, Armstrong's publicist said, 
and the actress is in negotiations to star in a possible network series. 
</P>
<P>
KLINTON SPILSBURY: Spilsbury rode off into the sunset after playing the masked 
man in the widely panned "The Legend of the Lone Ranger" (1981), but returned 
to L.A. six months ago and has "some things in the works." 
</P>
<P>
Spilsbury -- whose voice was dubbed in about half the film -- later married and 
went to Europe, where he modeled and did some TV commercials. After four years 
of marriage, his actress-wife Lisa Shure died from complications of diabetes. 
"I did some soul searching after that -- and traveling. I decided to live life 
to the hilt." 
</P>
<P>
Now 38, he's been working as a free-lance photographer, waiter, "even at a 
Subway sandwich place." He's recently signed with a commercial agent and is 
currently seeking theatrical representation. "There's been some interest -- but 
not all that great." 
</P>
<P>
VALERIE PERRINE: She emerged in "Slaughterhouse Five" (1972), then took off 
with "Lenny" (1974). But six years ago, after a string of bombs -- and 
diminishing offers -- Perrine moved to London to pursue a love affair with an 
investment banker. She returned to L.A. part-time in 1986, attempting a 
comeback with CBS's short-lived sitcom "Leo &amp; Liz in Beverly Hills" (1986) 
and a role in the feature, "Maid to Order" (1987). 
</P>
<P>
Returning full-time to the States last January, she was featured in NBC's 
version of "Sweet Bird of Youth" and appeared in the low-budget "Mask of 
Murder."

THE READERS' PICK FOR ARTIST OF THE '80S: U2; 
</P>
<P>
THE IRISH QUARTET'S INFLUENCE ON THE DECADE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL AND INARGUABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The voice of the people has selected the voice of the people. 
</P>
<P>
U2, Ireland's clamorous crusaders of social consciousness and Christian 
conscience, has been voted the Pop Artist of the '80s by The Times readers, who 
submitted 1,724 ballots. 
</P>
<P>
The top five finishers -- U2, Michael Jackson, Bruce Springsteen, Madonna and 
Prince -- compose a quintet whose impact on the spirit and style of the decade 
was substantial and inarguable. The order of finish forms a sort of alternating 
current of impulses: an agenda of social activism in the first, third and 
(sometimes) fifth spots, and a celebration of celebrity, ambition and eccentric 
individuality in the second, fourth and (sometimes) fifth spots. 
</P>
<P>
The vote, and the comments submitted by the electorate, support the widely held 
view that the decade's major development was the return of political and social 
causes to the mainstream pop arena after a decade of frivolity. 
</P>
<P>
Time and again, U2's supporters cited the band's idealism and its focus on big 
issues. Rick Adams of San Marino calls them "a band who stood their ground, 
drew attention to the troubles of the world, and whose lyrics inspired me to 
strive for excellence in everything I do." Offered Roseanne Ochoa of Orange, 
"The '80s will be remembered as the decade where a generation woke up and 
became aware of the troubles in the world around them, and no band symbolized 
that more than U2." 
</P>
<P>
Other partisans of the quartet caution that we shouldn't separate the band's 
activism from its art. "They have combined music that sounds great with music 
that says something," wrote Cathy Orth of La Mesa. And Matt Proietti of 
Crestline believes that "kids will listen to songs like 'Bad,' 'Sunday Bloody 
Sunday' and 'Bullet the Blue Sky' like we look back to the best of the Who, the 
Stones and Led Zep." 
</P>
<P>
Springsteen inspired similar sentiments from his voters, while Jackson and 
Madonna earned much of their support simply for being successful, and for 
forging themselves into pop-culture icons. As Mark Andrew of La Habra put it, 
"The pop artist of the '80s wasn't the best singer, songwriter, musician or 
performer, but the Best Package . . . Madonna." 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly, the contradictory Prince inspired the most wide-ranging and 
provocative comments, touching on his technical virtuosity, his influence on 
commercial pop music, his own sales success, his versatility and his mystery. 
Summarized LeClair Pearson of Long Beach: "He was prolific, he was 
unpredictable, he was his own man. There is only one Prince." 
</P>

THE CRITICS' PICK FOR ALBUM OF THE '80S: CLASH'S 'LONDON CALLING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Clash's "London Calling" tops The Times critics' poll as the best album of 
the '80s. The double album, which entered the U.S. charts in the first month of 
the decade, was a runaway winner, cited on seven of the 13 ballots from The 
Times' regular pop-music reviewers and registering 47 points under a system 
that awards 10 points for every first-place mention, nine for second place and 
so forth. In the diverse voting, 84 different albums were named. 
</P>
<P>
"London Calling," which also took top honors in Rolling Stone magazine's 
critics' poll of the '80s, came out of the British punk movement, but 
transcends that genre with 19 freewheeling songs that reflected the tense mood 
of working-class London. 
</P>
<P>
The runner-up also sprang from but transcended the late-'70s British punk 
scene: the debut album by the Pretenders, a quartet led by American Chrissie 
Hynde. Named on five ballots, it scored 34 points. The highest-rated solo 
artist was Paul Simon for "Graceland." 
</P>
<P>
If the scoring were based on artist rather than specific album, the winner 
would have Prince by a mile. Nine critics divided 65 points among three of his 
albums: "1999," "Purple Rain" and "Sign 'O' the Times." L.A. underground 
leaders X finished second with a total of 49 points for their "Los Angeles" and 
"Wild Gift" albums, ahead of such acclaimed big sellers as Bruce Springsteen 
and U2. The best-seller of all time, Michael Jackson's "Thriller," was named 
No. 1 on two ballots, but was passed over by the rest of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
Only two of the albums finishing in the Top 10 ("Graceland" and "Sign 'O' the 
Times") were released later than 1985, ignoring the late-'80s' flashiest 
musical developments: the chart domination of hard rock and the rise of rap. In 
rap's case, an argument could be made that it's essentially a singles medium 
and few great albums came out of the genre -- Public Enemy's "It Takes a Nation 
of Millions to Hold Us Back" was the only one to receive any votes.

NEIL YOUNG'S 'FREEDOM' TOPS 1989'S ALBUMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neil Young's "Freedom" was the most distinguished album of 1989, a work of 
immense passion and craft that provides an anxious anthem for societies (East 
and West) that are going through a period of re-examination. 
</P>
<P>
"Rockin' in the Free World," the anthem that opens and closes the veteran 
singer-songwriter's most gripping collection since his "Tonight's the 
Night"/"Zuma" packages in the mid-'70s, contains strains of both optimism and 
disillusionment. 
</P>
<P>
While celebrating the title rallying cry, the song decries the failure of 
citizens to live up to their responsibilities. Freedom, Young declares, isn't 
just measured by a country's the form of government, but by the generousity and 
spirit of people. 
</P>
<P>
In most of the 10 other songs in "Freedom," Young explores with insight and 
grace other issues of integrity and commitment, both social and personal. 
</P>
<P>
The only other albums of the past 12 months that rivaled "Freedom" for boldness 
of vision and consistency of craft were Peter Case's folk-accented "The Man 
With the Blue Postmodern Fragmented Neo-Traditionalist Guitar" and Lou Reed's 
"New York." 
</P>
<P>
Case's album was an especially intimate, somewhat autobiographical tale of 
searching for values in a doubting age, while "New York" was a forceful, if 
occasionally heavy-handed indictment of personal and political indifference and 
greed. They finished second and third respectively on my list of 1989's 10 best 
albums. 
</P>
<P>
A notch below these three, in order, are the Jesus and Mary Chain's "Automatic" 
and N.W.A's "Straight Outta Compton," albums that matched -- at times even 
exceeded the top choices -- in the area of boldness, but were less consistent. 
</P>
<P>
The Mary Chain, the London-based rock group, still works wonders with its 
strikingly arranged tales of romantic obsession, though "Automatic" fails to 
displace 1985's "Psychocandy" as the band's masterpiece. N.W.A's gangster 
narratives were year's most controversial and powerful tracks, but the rest of 
the album was too thin for it to rate higher than fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the Top 10, in order: the Fine Young Cannibals' "The Raw &amp; the 
Cooked" (short on substance, but otherwise sensational mix of rock instincts 
and soul textures); Neneh Cherry's "Raw Like Sushi" (wonderfully frisky 
attitude and an underlying thematic bite that is rare in dance pop). 
</P>
<P>
The Pixies' "Doolittle" (a challenging mixture of frequently comforting, if 
hyperactive arrangements and troubling themes from the promising Boston rock 
group); De La Soul's "3 Feet High and Rising" (the Long Island trio delivers 
the year's most varied and inventive rap package), and Terence Trent D'Arby's 
"Neither Fish Nor Flesh" (the controversial American ex patriot over-reached in 
trying to make a contemporary version of "Pet Sounds," but the highlights offer 
some of the freshest soul-rock-pop of the year). 
</P>
<P>
The most graphic way to discuss the relative merits of the albums is to assign 
them points -- on the traditional 0 to 100 scoring system. Under that system, 
"Freedom" deserves 92 -- which leaves it well below the 95 and above score 
registered by such key '80s albums as Bruce 
</P>
<P>
Springsteen's "Nebraska," U2's "The Joshua Tree" and Paul Simon's "Graceland." 
</P>
<P>
While Case and Reed would also deserve 90 or more on my score card, the 
remaining five albums would all fall into the 85 to 90 range. 
</P>
<P>
The runners-up, also in the 85 range: Soul II Soul's "Keep on Movin"' (some of 
the most stylish dance floor music of the '80s), Thelonious Monster's "Stormy 
Weather" (Bob Forrest writes about maturity without tears), the Cure's 
"Disintegration" (the British band's ode to the proposition that bleak can be 
beautiful). 
</P>
<P>
Also, Paul McCartney's "Flowers in the Dirt" (surprising gentleness and warmth 
in this major artistic recovery), Boogie Down Productions' "Ghetto Music: the 
Blueprint of Hip Hop" (KRS-One's socially conscious looks at inner-city 
problems and challenges are making him the Curtis Mayfield of rap) and Tone 
Loc's Loc'ed After Dark" (the liveliest rap party album since the Beastie Boys' 
"Licensed to Ill").

Urban music and urban concerns dominate the 1989 Times pop music critics poll, 
in which veteran Neil Young's feisty "Freedom" led the way, with Fine Young 
Cannibals' neo-English soul "The Raw &amp; the Cooked" and L.A. rap group 
N.W.A's controversial "Straight Outta Compton" right on its heels. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the 13 voters named "Freedom" on their year-end top 10 lists for a 
total of 38 points in a system that awards 10 points for each first place vote, 
nine for second and so on. A total of 70 albums received votes. 
</P>
<P>
"Freedom," mixing angry songs condemning societal indifference with tenderly 
longing ballads, represents Young's first poll appearance in the '80s after an 
erratic, sometimes confusing stretch of stylistic diversions that left some 
fans and critics behind. But "Freedom" snarls and crackles and points some very 
specific fingers. As such it pairs well with Peter Case's No. 8 entry, an angry 
though hopeful document of urban despair. 
</P>
<P>
But most significant in the top 10 this year is the solid showing of the sound 
of the inner city: rap. In prior polls a total of only two rap albums ever made 
the consensus lists; this year alone there were three -- four if you count 
Neneh Cherry's rap-influenced debut. 
</P>
<P>
"Compton" was among the most-debated albums of the year. Its brutal, 
profanity-filled accounts of life in L.A.'s ghettos drew fire from, among 
others, an FBI agent who sent the group a letter admonishing it for what he 
perceived to be encouraging violence against law enforcement officers. The 
L.A.-produced "Loc-ed After Dark" (which features "Wild Thing" -- the 
biggest-selling single since 1985's "We Are the World," with more than 2 
million copies sold) and the giddy but thoughtful and fresh New York sound of 
"3 Feet High" are tame by comparison, but their placing is recognition of rap's 
increasing breadth. 
</P>
<P>
Here are The Times pop music critics' first-place choices for 1989 album of the 
year (Robert Hilburn's top 10 appears above): 
</P>
<P>
Mike Boehm -- "Freedom," Neil Young; Richard Cromelin -- "3 Feet High and 
Rising," De La Soul; Jonathan Gold -- "Straight Outta Compton," N.W.A; Patrick 
Goldstein -- "Don't Tell a Soul," the Replacements; Paul Grein -- "Nick of 
Time," Bonnie Raitt (Capitol); Steve Hochman -- "Kite," Kirsty MacColl (Virgin 
import); Dennis Hunt -- "Keep on Movin'," Soul II Soul (Virgin); Connie Johnson 
-- "Neither Fish Nor Flesh," Terence Trent D'Arby (Columbia); Kristine McKenna 
-- "Love Ritual," Al Green (MCA); Don Snowden -- "Attainment," Charles Brackeen 
(Silkheart import); Don Waller -- "3 Feet High and Rising," De La Soul; Chris 
Willman -- "Spike," Elvis Costello.

THE '80S -- FROM NOUVELLE TO ANYTHING GOES

In 1980, fancy food was French, pizza was proletarian and salads contained 
iceberg lettuce. Most people hadn't heard of California Cuisine. Raw fish was 
considered fine fare for the seals at the zoo. Had you said "tirami-su" most 
people would have replied, "God bless you." Open kitchens were found in diners, 
grazing was an activity common to cows and blackened was just a nice way of 
saying burnt. 
</P>
<P>
Things changed. The '80s were an era of restaurant madness when we all learned 
about Cajun cuisine, graduated from spaghetti to pasta and found out that the 
waiter was our friend. It was a time when every upscale eater would learn sushi 
Japanese, taco-stand Spanish and all the Thai words for noodles. Chefs became 
celebrities. We discovered that vegetables were best as babies and that all 
olive oil should be virgin. We developed a passion for pepper, an aversion to 
salt and learned to love chiles. 
</P>
<P>
And that was just for starters. 
</P>

NOTEBOOK: LAYING HAROLD &amp; BELLE'S RUMORS TO REST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Denise Le Gaux isn't sure what's going on, but she wishes it would stop. Denise 
is co-owner, with her husband Harold and their friends Alvin and Susan Honor, 
of Harold &amp; Belle's, a popular 20-year-old Creole-style restaurant on W. 
Jefferson Boulevard in Los Angeles. (Belle was Harold's mother.) The restaurant 
has done well enough over the years, and in fact has recently undergone its 
third expansion since its founding. But a couple of months ago, says Le Gaux, 
people started calling up and asking if it was true that they were going to 
close. 
</P>
<P>
"It's become so much of an annoyance," she says. "Almost every day somebody 
asks us when we're going out of business or where we're moving too. Just a few 
hours ago, somebody called to make a reservation for later in the week, but 
first wanted to know if we were definitely still going to be open by then." 
Even more annoying, she adds, there are apparently rumors going around that 
Harold is seriously ill, and even that he has been shot. "Somebody called up 
and asked where they could send flowers, and when the funeral was going to be," 
she says. "I just don't know how all this got started." 
</P>
<P>
Let the rumors themselves be buried, then. Harold &amp; Belle's is open and 
plans to remain open, in its original location -- and Harold (and Denise, and 
Alvin and Susan) are all feeling just fine, thank you. "About the only thing 
that's changed lately other than our expansion," Denise adds, "is that we've 
added fried chicken to the menu. It isn't Creole, but it's good." 
</P>
<P>
And speaking of chicken, if you haven't found enough excuses to throw parties 
already this holiday season, you might consider celebrating the fact that the 
Buffalo chicken wing is 25 years old. This strange, curiously appealing 
all-American specialty -- deep-fried chicken wings served with hot dipping 
sauce, celery and blue cheese dressing -- was invented by the late Therese 
Bellissimo of Frank &amp; Theresa's Anchor Bar in Buffalo in late 1964. The 
story of its creation is the usual sort of thing -- left-over ingredients, 
last-minute guests, culinary ingenuity, and so forth -- but the Buffalo chicken 
wing has definitely taken off in the recent years. The Anchor Bar alone sells 
36,000 pounds of them a month. And that ain't chicken feed. 
</P>
<P>
RESTAURANT TIDBITS: Steven Mettle is the new chef at Gordon's in Aspen, 
replacing the co-founder of the restaurant, Gordon Naccarato. Naccarato retains 
an interest in Gordon's, as does his wife Rebecca, who remains at the 
establishment. Naccarato himself, meanwhile, is in Los Angeles at least 
temporarily, where he is helping out old friend Mark Peel in the kitchen of 
Campanile. . . . Patrick Healy of Champagne in West L.A., is headed for 
Honolulu next month to help former L.A. chef Roy Yamaguchi (Le Gourmet, 385 
North) celebrate the first anniversary of his Diamond Head restaurant, Roy's. 
Healy is the only mainlander to have been invited to join the festivities, 
though three other Hawaii-based chefs will also participate. . . . A lot of New 
York restaurateurs must be shaking these days, and not because they're spending 
too much time in their walk-in coolers, either. City officials have announced a 
crackdown on alleged cash rake-offs at area eating places. While not 
identifying suspected wrongdoers, a New York City spokesman claimed recently 
that as much as $6 billion might be due in taxes, interest and penalties on 
unreported restaurant income. The city also apparently plans to offer rewards 
to restaurant employees who finger their cash-grabbing bosses. 
</P>
<P>
SPELLING CHECK: After I noted in this column some months ago that Bruno's 
Chartreuse had reopened in Santa Monica on the site of the defunct Tosh, 
several readers contacted me to say that they were unable to get a phone number 
for the place from information operators. The problem, it turns out, is that 
the restaurant is now called simply Chartreuse. And the number, for your 
reference, is (213) 453-3333 . . . Paris-Brest in Woodland Hills was also the 
subject of many calls to this column. The problem, it turns out, is that the 
restaurant is listed as Le Paris- Brest. The number is (818) 888-9277.

WINE: WHAT A DIFFERENCE A DECADE MAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Inflation was perking along at better than 11%, the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average opened 1980 at under 840, and wine lovers were buying First Growth 
Bordeaux for less than $20 a bottle. The best California Chardonnays were $8; 
the best Cabernets were $7.50. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Dow is above 2,600 and you can't get a glass of a First Growth 
Bordeaux for less than ten bucks. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, Chenin Blanc and Riesling still sold rather well. You'd also 
see a lot of the so-called Soft Johannisberg Riesling and Soft Chenin Blanc, 
which were sweeter, low-alcohol wines developed by the late Ed Friedreich at 
San Martin Winery. Blue Nun was in its heyday. 
</P>
<P>
Fad wines heading into 1980 were Pouilly-Fuisse a mediocre Macon white that 
usually didn't represent good value but sold because Americans liked to show 
they could pronounce French, Lambrusco and the remnants of the soda-like 
sangria. Red wine was still just for snobs. Rose, Chenin Blanc and Riesling 
were barely hanging on. By the end of the decade, White Zinfandel rocked to the 
front as a bona fide trend, moving from less than 30,000 cases in 1980 to about 
11 million cases in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Chianti was essentially still packaged in bulbus-bottomed, straw-wrapped 
fiaschi and upscale Italian wine was just beginning to be seen in the United 
States in the form of Barolo and Barbaresco at prices -- $6 to $10 -- that some 
consumers felt were outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
German wines were still selling because of the availability of wines from the 
great vintages of the prior decade -- 1971, 1975 and 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Among the top "hot," upscale restaurant brands a decade ago were The Monterey 
Vineyard, Clos du Val, Chappellet, Mayacamas, Domaine Chandon, Chateau St. 
Jean, Mondavi, Jordan, Caymus, and Freemark Abbey. Fetzer wasn't a major force; 
Glen Ellen wasn't born, nor was Sonoma Cutrer, Ferrari Carano, and Randy Dunn 
had made just one wine. 
</P>
<P>
Through the late 1970s, wine-by-the-glass was typically poured from a 
multi-gallon jug by a bartender far from the sight of the patron. That all 
changed in the '80s largely because of a machine called the Cruvinet. 
</P>
<P>
With the Cruvinet, in which the bottle being dispensed is open to view, the 
patron could see the label of the bottle being ordered, and the brand name of 
the wine became a status symbol that restaurateurs felt justified a higher 
price per glass -- $6 to $7 in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
A real change in wine drinking habits came about early in the decade as 
Americans discovered California Chardonnay and Fume Blanc (the term Sauvignon 
Blanc was not as popular back then) to be fashionable dry wines that matched 
with food. It was an exciting time of transition. Wine collectors who 
previously bought just a handful of wines began to see labels from literally 
dozens of prestigious new properties. 
</P>
<P>
This new approach to wine also prompted restaurants to look at their glassware, 
which began a kind of mini-trend toward better wine stemware. That trend took a 
major stride forward recently when Patina, Joachim Splichal's new restaurant on 
Melrose, began using Reidl stemware, one of the most perfect and attractive 
lines of wine glasses. 
</P>
<P>
The physical appearance of the restaurant wine list began to change about 1980 
as the computer entered the business. In the past, these lists were often 
expensive to produce, frequently the work of a caligrapher using a gold-tipped 
pen. Because they changed so infrequently, restaurateurs were loath to add new 
wines to their list, or run out of old favorites. And because they didn't 
change from year to year, often they contained no vintage dates. But as 
restaurants discovered the computer, loose-leaf wine books came of age.

THE '80S A SPECIAL REPORT; 
</P>
<P>
PUTTING THE '80S BEHIND US; 
</P>
<P>
WHY HAS A DECADE THAT FOR A FEW MOMENTS WAS SO BUOYANT ENDED IN SUCH SEETHING 
MEAN-SPIRITEDNESS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The phrase has a nice sound, iambic and alliterative, a door softly clicking 
shut: The end of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
But no divorce is truly final. One of the paradoxes of American life is how 
deeply the phrase "put it behind us" is rooted in our cultural lexicon -- 
implying how often we find ourselves having to "heal" from one form or another 
of lacerating violence and betrayal. Yet we love our nostalgic, picture-book 
essays, our trivial pursuit into the torrential imagery of the past. 
</P>
<P>
The '80s, for a few moments so buoyant, now seem so shallow that their 
after-image is already fading before our eyes, like the memory of those 
prominent paintings spirited out of sight by nouveau riche zillionaires. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows it was a time in which everything of value was tinged with the 
color of money, a period of the blockbuster deal and postponed moral debt. The 
takeover artist, whether entrepreneurial or corporate, became the cultural 
mover as business rumbled the arts. Our growingly sophisticated media 
technology blitzed us with unprecedented media hype. Our insatiable thirst for 
entertainment required an ever-widening pool of empty celebrity to satisfy us. 
The image became our lingua franca. 
</P>
<P>
And what has this meant to the American culture? 
</P>
<P>
Paul Simon may have been kidding-in-earnest when in "Graceland" he sang, "This 
is an age of miracles and wonder." The end of the '80s will be noted as the 
time when the American Century posted its closing notice early, when the Cold 
War '40s rolled to their end at last with the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and 
Europe felt young again while America seemed suddenly to grow fussy and old. 
</P>
<P>
"No one ever dreamed that the West's vision of utopia would turn out to be 
American," said author-journalist Tom Wolfe. "You talk to the young 
intellectuals in Europe; they're looking to America. What has happened in this 
great battle of ideas -- democracy versus Marxism -- can only be an enormous 
victory to the country. Unless the colossal Matterhorn of debt collapses on 
us." 
</P>
<P>
If the Reagan Revolution represents both the climax of America's postwar 
attempt to maintain a free world and an unprecedented domestic wealth, why is 
it that life on our cultural front isn't correspondingly jubilant? 
</P>
<P>
Why has the decade ended in such seething mean-spiritedness, where Kathleen 
Turner and Michael Douglas savage each other in "The War of the Roses" with 
infinitely greater malice than the Bickersons or even George and Martha in 
"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"; where Andrew Dice Clay's sneering depiction 
of women as submissive sexual pigs whips his audiences into brute, misogynistic 
glee; where Spike Lee's Mookie in "Do the Right Thing" (one of the few movies 
of the decade to carry the charge of a gut concern) touches off a race riot and 
then demands payment from the man whose life he's virtually destroyed? 
</P>
<P>
A sullen mood of betrayal hangs over the culture. Where once TV cop shows 
contented themselves with tracking pimps, murderers and drug-dealers and then 
cutting to the chase that gets evil into the slammer by 10 o'clock, the 
Byzantine plot of "Wise Guy" unfolds over a common theme -- the good guy is 
being sold out by his superiors, who are involved in a cover-up. The corruption 
of authority is a given now in our prime-time consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
If you're going back to the future again, you'll discover that your Mom looks 
like a novice hooker. If you're coming back from the future, it will be with 
the report that John Rambo has metamorphosed into a cyborgenic terminator with 
an Austrian accent who, even after all his skin has been seared off and his 
body dismembered, will still try to strangle the object of his obsessive hunt 
-- an innocent woman. 
</P>
<P>
The over-technologized, post-apocalyptic future itself looks to be broken down 
into smoky pockets of warring barbaric tribes, surly Hulk Hogans brandishing 
Uzis and chains. In Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner," Rutger Hauer's poignant 
message about the sanctity of life is uttered from dying lips in a world that 
resembles an overturned incinerator. Emerson observed of America, "All has an 
onward, a prospective look." Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
The technology of our age of miracles and wonder included the CD, PC, microwave 
oven, computer workplace, fax, cellular phone, aerodynamic auto design, 
computerized ticket sales, satellite communications, the hand-held videotape 
recorder, the Panther movie camera, colorization, the lithium-based battery, 
ethanol and the Mavica camera. (Polavision, the disc camera, RCA's $250-million 
investment in the video disc and the Betamax were ideas whose time came and 
went). 
</P>
<P>
All these modes of communication with so little to communicate. If, as Harvard 
psychologist Howard Gardner tells us, "Music mirrors the structure and the 
range of our emotions: it has the same kind of flow as our emotional life," 
what does the industrial screech of heavy metal tell us about psychic structure 
and range, or the relentless pile-driver rhythm of rap that makes no allowance 
for melodic possibility? Which may be the point: The rapper's world is not a 
melodic place. Is the rise of MTV a tacit confession that the bulk of our pop 
music is aesthetically insupportable without a series of mannered and 
pretentious visual images to lend it appeal? How much of that stuff can we sing 
in the shower? 
</P>
<P>
True, the '80s didn't get off to a great start. The national mood was sour from 
the murky spillover of the '70s, which saw the fall of Saigon and the 
resignation of a disgraced President. OPEC's control of the world's oil 
pipelines, American embassy officials still held hostage in Tehran, and a 
threatened 18% inflation rate gave credence to the portents of minimalism: 
American power was on the wane. 
</P>
<P>
Summing up, Lance Morrow wrote in Time magazine, "Mostly the air in the '70s 
was thick with the sense of aftermath, of public passions spent and consciences 
bewildered. The American gaze turned inward. It distracted itself with 
diversions, trivial or squalid; primal screaming, disaster movies, jogging, 
disco, Perrier water. The U.S. had lost a President and a war. . . . Many of 
the themes were woven around diminution. Paul Volker, head of the Federal 
Reserve Board, said last fall that in his view the American standard of living 
would have to decline -- a serious crack in traditional capitalist optimism. . 
. . The '70s were given over to building private, not public, morale. Est, 
Arica, Esalen, transactional analysis, set about fumigating the American 
psyche." The odd thing is that, materially speaking, the country had never had 
it so good. 
</P>
<P>
The '70s spillage into the '80s were characterized by what seemed a spate of 
death and dying plays such as "Whose Life Is It Anyway?" and, later, " 'night, 
Mother," which were gloomy not because of their subject but because they seemed 
false, spiritually hollow. They were really plays about capitulation. Our 
bookshelves bulged with paranoid fantasies of urban guerrilla terrorism, such 
as Robert Ludlum's "The Bourne Identity" and Bill Michaels and Lewis Orde's 
"The Night They Stole Manhattan." Movie attendance slumped. Some blamed 
inflation, but more to the point, it seemed, nobody wanted to go out anymore. 
It was the start of the "cocooning" phenomenon that later led to the technology 
of the home entertainment center. 
</P>
<P>
But slowly, as the decade settled in, the national mood began to lift. After an 
economic nose-dive in '82, the Reagan revolution began to take hold, led by a 
President who seemed buoyant, ageless and invincible, who could crack jokes on 
the gurney after he'd been shot in the street. 
</P>
<P>
This was really our kind of guy, a warm, mediagenic, patriotic, congenial, 
can-do figure, flush with optimism and faith in homespun America. He was 
20th-Century America's home movie. The Tampico of his infancy lies in close 
spiritual proximity to the Hannibal, Mo., of Mark Twain -- and he kept 
retooling it to fit the popular images of the American Century. He may have 
been, as Tom Wolfe reminds us, "the most issue-oriented President since 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a real conservative who forced other politicians to 
take a stand on issues." But what we liked most of all was that he never turned 
us down for a hit of what George Will called "his narcotic cheerfulness." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, George Orwell's spectral vision of civilization as penal society 
failed to materialize. On the contrary, the nation seemed to burst out of the 
winter of its discontent to splurge on the opulence and splendor of the summer 
Olympics, where the world came to Los Angeles and the city put on its best 
party manners to insure that the traffic kept flowing and that there would be 
no riff-raff, ideological or plain troublesome, to spoil the fun. 
</P>
<P>
An international arts festival gave us the momentary feel of global centrality 
(even if it did expose the shabbiness of a lot of our local product, such as 
Equity Waiver theater), so that when the improbable Rocketman flew into the 
Coliseum to begin the ceremonies, and David Wolper's opening musical production 
flash-flooded us with a magnificent seraphic high, everything for once seemed 
to fall into place. An immaculate powder-blue sky stretched over the Games and 
everyone warmed to the sensual nuzzling of the Santa Ana breezes as the best 
hope of the new world -- its young -- began their trials on the field below. 
</P>
<P>
It hardly mattered that the Soviet bloc was a no-show; the gold medal this year 
went to capitalism -- after a lot of prognostications of disaster, the 
privatization of the Games made them the most profitable in history. What a 
movie! For a couple of weeks we were Randy Newman tooling a big Buick 
convertible through balmy sun-drenched afternoons, arm around that big nasty 
redhead, hearing "We love it!" from nearly every conceivable ethnic and age 
group around town -- even the winos smiled and waved hello. 
</P>
<P>
On a deeper level, the country turned to the Games in a big way not only 
because sport beyond its quick-fix excitement is suspenseful and unambiguous, 
but because these athletes' one-time efforts couldn't be faked, or edited, or 
canned, or even repeated. 
</P>
<P>
But of course they were just games, a distraction. Earlier in the year, before 
they got under way, we had already begun to pick up on the new acedia. After 
the bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, the President told the 
country, "If there is to be blame, it properly rests here, in this office and 
with this President. And I accept responsibility for the bad as well as the 
good" -- and did nothing. 
</P>
<P>
By now we knew we were seeing the divorce between word and meaning acted out at 
the highest level; that was nothing really new. But now the deregulation of 
content began turning up everywhere as the '60s and '70s cult of narcissism 
hooked up with the '80s cult of money and a new generation of young Babbits 
flocked to their BMW showrooms and nouvelle cuisine restaurants, and heard 
their empty souls' lament exquisitely calibrated in "thirtysomething's" sodden 
Angst. If pot was the drug of choice in the '60s and paranoia its emotional 
byproduct, coke, crack and ice came along in the '80s to feed its penchant for 
megalomania. 
</P>
<P>
"Greed is good, greed is healthy" trumpeted Ivan Boesky, one of the princes of 
the new wealth, some time before he was nabbed as a central figure in the 
biggest insider-trading scam in history. Nearly everyone, it seemed, was on the 
take. Ranking Republican officials looked on public office as an extension of 
their business careers. Stock traders and corporate raiders grabbed companies 
by the heels in leveraged buyouts and shook out all the loose change they could 
before cutting them up, or forcing them to borrow against their future. Plunder 
was certainly nothing new in American history, but none of our New Age robber 
barons were building universities and museums. 
</P>
<P>
The art of the '80s became, as Donald Trump put it, "The Art of the Deal." 
David Mamet caught the hustler's tone perfectly in "Glengarry Glen Ross," in 
which a real estate con artist dazzles his prey in a restaurant banquette with 
a series of magnificent, hypnotically empty verbal glissandi, before he 
relieves him of his check for a parcel of Florida swampland. Oliver Stone 
caught it too in "Wall Street," where Charlie Sheen's moral opprobrium seemed 
petulant and schoolmarmish in the face of Michael Douglas' buccaneer panache. 
</P>
<P>
In art and entertainment, the atmosphere of deregulation further obscured any 
standards of critical measure regarding talent and achievement. Celebrity 
became the new commodity as earnest reportage of the hot and the new took up 
more and more air and tabloid space in the afflatus of '80s entertainment 
reportage. Nobody seemed to mind that there wasn't much to report -- for weeks, 
it seemed, America breathlessly awaited the latest details on Oprah's diet. 
Baby Jessica's confinement made good copy; the 25% of American children born 
into poverty didn't. 
</P>
<P>
If greed was good, scandal could lead to a payoff too as any number of 
disgraced public officials, white-collar ex-cons and fading movie and rock 
stars with a substance dependency confessed their wicked, wicked ways in 
best-selling autobiographies. There was nothing hallowed about the nation's 
capitol steps for Rita Jenrette, who thought they'd be a kicky place to make it 
with her congressman husband. Donna Rice climbed like a coquette into Gary 
Hart's lap and his political career collapsed. After Jessica Hahn exposed Jim 
Bakker's clammy depredations, she exposed herself as well in a Playboy 
centerfold and defended her exhibitionism by saying she was proud of the body 
God had given her. Then she decided to improve on the job by having it 
completely made over. 
</P>
<P>
The business of America had become business once again (Wall Street reports 
took up a heftier share of our news programming, and even carved a niche in Los 
Angeles' only local commercial jazz station). And it liked what it saw in the 
worlds of culture and entertainment. Tens of millions of dollars -- much more 
money than any museum save the Getty could hope to afford -- went towards the 
acquisition of Van Goghs and Picassos, which then disappeared from public view. 
Corporate conglomerates made further incursions into Hollywood studios, TV 
networks and newspapers, which meant that the bulk of movie makers, network 
programmers and magazine and news editors felt more answerable to marketing 
experts than to the public. Good ratings became more of an imperative than 
ever. Demographics became the euphemism for the lowest common denominator. 
</P>
<P>
While network anchors successfully courted stardom, John Hart -- one of our 
best -- left NBC to anchor "World Monitor" on cable's Discovery channel. "It 
was disheartening over the last several years," he said. "Almost all the 
decisions about what to air were made on the basis of ratings instead of 
editorial content. It was all artifice, the glib taking the place of the 
articulate. Art connects. Artifice diverts. I worry about our system of news 
and entertainment becoming an exploitation of fantasy. America made the crass 
choice in the '80s. I think there's a hunger for human size, for trustworthy 
content that's communicated in a way that's simple. The central values, like 
freedom, are simple. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry that we've lost our sense of context in our schools and pop culture. 
We've come to believe that we can really act out our fantasies. We're a people 
with a strong sense of justice. We crave romantic love, peace. We want the 
homeless, poverty and AIDS to go away. But nothing is real on the tube. We have 
all this information, but we don't feel we have a grasp on our lives. Most of 
the trouble you can base on advertising, which is based on the residue of 
rejection and betrayal, not being loved. It exploits those feelings. 
Advertising has become a storm of accusation. How can you break through?" 
</P>
<P>
It may be that with the information revolution exploding in sparks under the 
channel-chasing fingers of the viewing public, the potential for overload has 
become so great that we've come to prefer the diversions of incessant novelty 
over the sometime discomfort of innovation, with its implicit requirement of 
change. Or that the modern classic antagonism between the artist and society in 
America has become too one-sided. What else could explain the pusillanimity and 
poverty of ideas in so much of the culture of the '80s, the decade of the 
retread. 
</P>
<P>
In both ends of '80s, when Broadway wanted to commemorate the dance, it 
couldn't think of anything to do except revive Jerome Robbins' choreography. 
The theater blockbuster has been thoroughly redefined by Andrew Lloyd Webber's 
gaudy musical dirigibles. Even Stephen Sondheim is plagiarizing himself. The 
gadgetry of '50s spy thrillers has resurfaced in Tom Clancy's techno-pop 
best-sellers. If we can't have Marilyn anymore, Madonna will do. Instead of 
Jackie Gleason, we have Roseanne. Mary Richards has left the news office; 
Murphy Brown is the new hire. 
</P>
<P>
Scratch Arsenio Hall's veneer of hip to find celebrity sycophant Merv Griffin. 
Maybe that's unfair to Merv -- he could sing. And what is it with all these 
talk shows all over again, with Donahue, Geraldo, Oprah, Sally Jessy, Johnny, 
Pat, Byron, Fritz and David? 
</P>
<P>
If you can't get on the air, you can yak it up all day and all night on talk 
radio. David Reisman called us "The Lonely Society" in the '50s. Nothing's 
changed, except we're noisier now with eager confession and aggressive 
self-absorption, which translates into public rudeness and incivility. We can't 
seem to distinguish between honesty and tactlessness, blunt opinions and 
considered ideas. Yet nobody seems to have the moral or aesthetic authority to 
challenge sleaze and the push of attention-grabbing incompetents. In the '50s, 
young intellectuals talked their dates out of their leotards with mournful 
soliloquies on existential emptiness. Now the deconstructivist tells us: trust 
me, it's all sign language. You give it the meaning. You and the night and the 
music. 
</P>
<P>
As the decade began to wear down, the culture became more and more overrun by 
show-biz values. Shirley MacLaine charged us $300 a head to hear of her 
extraterrestrial adventures. Jerry Falwell plummeted down a waterslide on TV in 
his suit and tie to benefit Heritage USA, and Oral Roberts climbed into his 
office tower in a well-publicized attempt to extort $8 million from God. No 
corporate head honcho had really arrived until he'd made his own TV commercial. 
</P>
<P>
When Oliver North made his appearance in the lineup of new dirty tricksters in 
the Iran-Contra hearings, the nation sat up and rubbed its eyes. Here was an 
authentic hero, not one of the Sheen family play-acting war. Look at all that 
salad on this proud young Marine's chest! See the earnest patriotic gleam in 
his eye and hear the catch of noble cause in his throat as he volunteered the 
truth, good bad and ugly. Mister Smith had come to Washington at last! But then 
we saw the equivocation, his lawyer's contempt for our elected representatives. 
They pegged the colonel for a liar and self-promoter and we slumped back into 
our funk. 
</P>
<P>
We looked for plausible earnestness elsewhere. For a while, the comedy boom 
gave us the sense of actual as opposed to prepackaged human exchange, a chance 
to hear rare social criticism live. But the top comedians kicked themselves 
upstairs into movies and television and we were left with a generally sorry 
foul-mouthed group of show-biz acolytes who cannibalized each other's skimpy 
material and bored us with attitude. Even the luster of sports began to dim. 
Magic and the Lakers were still good for show time, and wouldn't we miss the 
baleful Kareem after all. But Robert Irsay whisked the NFL's Colts to 
Indianapolis under cover of darkness and broke the heart of working-class 
Baltimore, and America's team gave its innovative coach a pink slip instead of 
a gold watch. Hey, that's show biz. 
</P>
<P>
By decade's end, half the nation was in a swoon over "Field of Dreams," which 
the other half viewed as a dewy crock of ersatz nostalgia, sure proof that 
cloud-cuckooland had become a prime entertainment option. "When Harry Met Sally 
. . ." ostensibly posed the question "Can friendship between a man and a woman 
exist without sex?," but on a deeper unconscious level touched on a uniquely 
contemporary dilemma. For now every cell in the human body was shadowed with 
the foreknowledge that sex was no longer the most primal human repudiation of 
death. AIDS was spreading through the culture. Sex and death were one. 
</P>
<P>
It's amazing how certain themes keep cropping up in American history. Well over 
a century ago, Emerson warned of "the tensions that threaten to turn the dream 
into a nightmare," citing among them the destruction of individuality and the 
difficulty of really experiencing the world. 
</P>
<P>
As the '80s wound down, it seems our experience of the world was less direct 
than ever. "My friends," George Bush told us in the presidential campaign of 
'88, "flag sales are doing well. America is doing well." More than ever our 
candidates' entourages, the PR consultants, pollsters, speechwriters, handlers, 
coaches and spin doctors, kept their clients from spontaneous view. The art of 
politics became the choreography of the image. News pundits and reporters wound 
up interviewing each other to assess the quality of sound bites and photo 
opportunities, and to tell us what to conclude about the speech we'd just 
heard. "We thought of ourselves as producers," Reagan staffer Michael Deaver 
told PBS' Bill Moyers, who in turn worried about "spectacle overcoming 
analysis." 
</P>
<P>
"The country has cut off its vocal cords," says art critic and historian Robert 
Hughes. "The only real drama left is the drama of the market. The rest of 
America is mired in emptiness because its leaders can't issue a statement that 
hasn't been pawed over by their handlers. The sense of public discourse is 
dying under the weight of euphemism, which is the tool of the mass media. 'Have 
a nice day.' If language doesn't live up to its responsibilities, it dies. I 
love this country. It's a great place. But it's running out of ideas, a 
conception of itself. It's unable to maintain its priorities and an 
authoritative show of cultural elan." 
</P>
<P>
David Puttnam came and went through Columbia's presidential executive suite in 
record time. His failure as a studio head didn't invalidate his hard view of 
what had become one of the great American dream machines -- the film industry 
-- and he summed up the decade as well as anyone when he told PBS, "The cinema 
was developing an ethos in young people in the '50s, but by the '70s it showed 
an America that had become nihilistic, self-loathing, violent and antagonistic 
within itself. The image it's projecting is not an honest one. The thing I 
loathe more than anything has become fashionable: cynicism. The audience is 
viewed as a kind of lumpenproletariat, totally ill-considered." 
</P>
<P>
Mort Sahl has been both a political and media watcher for over 30 years, and 
underscores Puttnam's view. "There's a 9 to 5 amorality which the industry 
calls for, having prostrated itself on the altar of materialism," he said. "The 
media aristocrats make fun of America. Look at all that cheering when Jim 
Bakker got 45 years. They're still angry at their mothers and fathers. What's 
the spirit of the movies? 'The Burbs'? 'The War of the Roses'? It's the rage of 
cowards, not a rage at the devil." 
</P>
<P>
Usually we don't feel the end of a decade until two or three years into the 
following decade. But by the time Ronald Reagan made his last hurrah and picked 
up his $2 million for a day's work in Tokyo, we had begun to feel our sense of 
aftermath early. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow the idea of big bucks had not only lost its allure, but money-grubbing 
and ostentation were becoming objects of scorn (even if our moneyed industry 
types reverted to traditional Hollywood vulgarity in their architectural 
tear-down monstrosities). Look at Leona Helmsley. 
</P>
<P>
The adjuration towards "a kinder gentler nation" implied that we'd been 
otherwise. The money hadn't trickled down after all. Patriotism's evil 
stepchildren, xenophobia and intolerance, showed up in Howard Beach and 
Brooklyn, and led to the resurgence of the Klan and anti-Japanese sentiment. We 
hadn't moved very fast to ward off the lethal incursion of AIDS. After all, 
wasn't it the disease of gays and junkies? Who needed a literate nation? We can 
get everything we need to know from TV. 
</P>
<P>
For as long as the media are used to exploit us as consumers instead of 
citizens, our kinder, gentler nation won't be a safer, more knowledgeable 
place. Our cities are running out of doorways for the homeless to sleep in. The 
deficit looms like an aneurysm. The earth is darkening with the toxemia of 
accumulating poisons, many of them made in the U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of fine artists, writers, composers and musicians who had a 
productive decade, and the burgeoning magazine industry, as well as cable TV, 
are good signs that the diversity of our cultural appetite is being addressed. 
And if the NEA/Mapplethorpe flap struck an ominous note about the government's 
support of the arts, at least it's brought the relationship into focus and 
mobilized real -- not stage-managed -- debate. 
</P>
<P>
Even our sharpest critics rarely fail to observe our native sense of humor and 
fair play, and our generous impulse to help out, whether in South Carolina 
after a hurricane, San Francisco after an earthquake, Chernobyl after a nuclear 
accident or Eritrea during a famine. But we've always been a troubled, restless 
people, with a long history of violence. If it's the truth that sets us free, 
it doesn't look as though a lot of the arts and entertainment of the '90s will 
be doing the job of telling it, of reminding us that there's a difference 
between freedom and escape.

MISS MANNERS: SUBLIME PLEASURES OF THANK-YOU NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everybody who celebrates Christmas is looking forward to tomorrow afternoon, 
Miss Manners trusts. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, she knows that you plan to open your presents in the morning, or perhaps 
Christmas Eve night. What she had in mind was the happy anticipation of 
spending Christmas afternoon writing thank-you letters. 
</P>
<P>
What an opportunity this is to curl up cozily in a favorite corner, with a 
trusted old fountain pen and piles of enticingly fresh paper at hand, and dash 
off notes expressive of your gratitude at being remembered, your delight in new 
possessions, and your overflowing warmth toward those who took so much care on 
your behalf. It also gives Christmas dinner a chance to settle. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Manners is hearing some murmurs from the crowd. Perhaps there are 
questions concerning this simple and rewarding task. 
</P>
<P>
Yes? You, there, holding the, ah -- what is that thing, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
"Exactly," you reply. "What about something I hate? Do I still have to write a 
thank-you note, and if so, what can I possibly say?" 
</P>
<P>
Miss Manners should not have to point out that it is just as much trouble to 
select a useless, ugly object as it is a treasure. It is therefore necessary 
for the unlucky recipient to render thanks for an unwelcome present as much as 
for a welcome one. But as the giver obviously did not know how useless and ugly 
the stupid thing was, the goal of the thank-you letter is to avoid enlightening 
him or her on this point. It should therefore be indistinguishable from one 
written out of genuine appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
"How can I do that without lying?" 
</P>
<P>
Miss Manners wishes that just once in a while she would hear such declarations 
of devotion to honesty when it is not a question of getting out of a task (or 
delivering an insult). There should be no trouble about saying honestly how 
grateful you were to be remembered. Since a thank-you letter must also contain 
something about the present, Miss Manners recommends to the morally fastidious 
the words wonderful, terrific and awesome. A ghastly present can easily be any 
one of these, as your dictionary will confirm. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I have to write to people I thanked in person?" 
</P>
<P>
Only for extraordinary presents. An oral "Gee, I really liked the car" is not 
enough; a written document after a personal exchange of fruitcakes is too much. 
</P>
<P>
"Can I save time by doing my thank-you letters on the computer?" 
</P>
<P>
Do you suppose that your grandparents don't recognize an all-purpose computer 
paragraph when they see one? Thank-you letters must be handwritten. Miss 
Manners does give special dispensation to those for whom that is a hardship -- 
if the writing hand is arthritic, for example -- but will no longer tolerate 
abuses of this indulgence from those who are too lazy to write legibly. 
</P>
<P>
"Can I fax it?" 
</P>
<P>
Yes, provided that you are not violating the rule against using office 
equipment for personal business. Miss Manners is not unreasonable; she likes 
toys as much as the next person who tries to dignify them under the name of 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- Should signet and monogram rings be worn so that the crest 
and initials face the person wearing the ring, or in the opposite direction so 
that the face of the ring is upright for an observer? 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Miss Manners hopes you do not fancy that such a ring has the 
same purpose as a designer label, explaining the provenance of the body wearing 
it. 
</P>
<P>
As it is not intended to be read by appraisers, it is not worn to face the 
public.

TIME TAKES TEACHER'S INTENTIONS

<P>
After Clarence, Robert was Mrs. Zajac's most troublesome student. But Chris 
Zajac had liked Clarence. She didn't especially like Robert. On the day of 
Kelly School's Science Fair she would learn how badly she had failed him. 
</P>
<P>
Last in a five-part series 
</P>
<P>
Chris Zajac strode down the corridor toward her classroom. The halls were 
wonderfully quiet. Her skirt rustled. She quick-marched, hand swinging high. 
Her mind was filled with heated, exasperated thoughts about Robert. 
</P>
<P>
Weeks ago, Robert had said he wouldn't do a project for the Science Fair. She 
had tried to talk him into it, and finally, he had agreed. Robert was a genius 
at bringing out the worst in her. 
</P>
<P>
Robert had crew-cut black hair. His wide face looked as if it had been cut from 
a square block. He was big all over, with the ample belly of a middle-aged 
softball player. He had an improbably squeaky voice. 
</P>
<P>
He lived in an old, run-down apartment building in the lower-class Highlands, 
not many blocks from where Chris grew up. 
</P>
<P>
Where had Robert learned that the best way to deal with failure is to embrace 
it? One time, after Chris handed back a test, Robert said loudly, "F! F's my 
specialty!" 
</P>
<P>
Another time, Chris told Felipe he had to stop leaning back in his chair. She 
tacked on a cautionary tale of a former student of hers who had fallen backward 
and cracked open his head. 
</P>
<P>
"Did blood spurt all over?" said Robert, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
Chris tried to add some fun to Friday's spelling tests by putting the 
children's names into sentences: "Firefly. Mariposa caught a firefly in her 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
"And squished it," piped up Robert in his squeaky voice. He gurgled. 
</P>
<P>
"Smother," Chris said during one test. "You shouldn't put a pillow in a baby's 
crib, or it might smother itself." 
</P>
<P>
"That'd be a riot," declared Robert. 
</P>
<P>
Robert was capable. Chris had asked Robert's reading group what sort of teacher 
she would be if, like the girl in the story they were reading, she didn't care 
for her job. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd let the kids do whatever they wanted," said Robert without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
His misspent intelligence angered her. 
</P>
<P>
"He could be at grade level. Easy. He could be getting A's," she thought. 
</P>
<P>
Robert was one of those children who make it hard for a teacher to like them. 
Not quite consciously, but on purpose. She had kept telling herself that she 
admired his boldness and his outspoken hatred of school. But then he'd start 
gurgling over the idea of a baby being smothered or refuse to do a science 
project and shrug his shoulders when she asked why. 
</P>
<P>
Chris stopped in the doorway to her classroom. Robert sat at a desk near the 
door, his broad back toward her. 
</P>
<P>
"You! Get over here!" she said. 
</P>
<P>
At the sound of Mrs. Zajac's voice, Robert ducked his head. What lay on his 
desk was hidden from Chris for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
"Pick yourself up and get to the office," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert stood up. His arms hung limply in front of him. His chin was pressed to 
his chest. His broad face was bright. He trudged, listing to one side, toward 
Mrs. Zajac in the doorway. 
</P>
<P>
Chris looked at him. Something was wrong. He wasn't smirking. He was clearly 
upset. She looked at his desk, then the tightness left her jaw. She let her 
shoulders sag, and her face turned as red as Robert's. 
</P>
<P>
On Robert's desk, she saw a weathered scrap of 2x6 with raggedly cut ends. On 
each of its longer edges was a flashlight battery, precariously secured to the 
board by a profusion of bent and twisted nails. A tangle of wires, twisted 
around other nails, covered the surface of the board. 
</P>
<P>
An attempt had been made to tape the ends of the wires to the batteries and to 
a small light bulb. The bulb had a broken filament. A hammer and some outsize 
nails lay on Robert's desk next to his project. 
</P>
<P>
He had tried to make an electric light. 
</P>
<P>
It suddenly looked like a very difficult thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
Chris looked at the project and she saw all at once a Robert slightly different 
from the one she thought she'd known just a minute ago. All year long, she had 
tried to get Robert to take a chance and make an effort. Now he had. He had 
tried, and he had sincerely failed. 
</P>
<P>
And she had rewarded him with humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
How many times had something like this happened to him in his life already? Was 
this the reason Robert behaved as he did? Is self-inflicted pain better than 
sadness and despair? 
</P>
<P>
She looked at the lashed-up wires and bent nails on the dirty scrap of wood, 
and it was all there in front of her: He had no one at home to help him make an 
electrical light. 
</P>
<P>
That was why he'd said he didn't want to do a project. He wasn't just being 
perverse. 
</P>
<P>
"How stupid I am!" she thought. 
</P>
<P>
She should have bent the rules and given him more help. She should have 
arranged a success for him. "How stupid I am!" 
</P>
<P>
"Sit down, Robert," she said softly. 
</P>
<P>
He sat down at the desk and wouldn't look at his project. He looked at his feet 
instead, arms dangling down between his legs. She sat next to him. "Why aren't 
you coming to the fair?" 
</P>
<P>
"Doesn't work." His voice was a squeak. He stared at the floor. 
</P>
<P>
"When were you supposed to figure that out, Robert? Before now. Right, Robert?" 
</P>
<P>
But her voice was very gentle. Not much of the year remained, but enough for 
her to make a change in herself, too. No matter how infuriating he might be 
tomorrow or next week, she wasn't going to let herself feel truly angry at him 
again. He had let her see the wounded little boy inside the fat would-be 
comedian. 
</P>
<P>
She felt like crying. At last, he had let her like him. 
</P>
<P>
Robert made a series of little shrugs and began picking at the wads of black 
electrical tape on his project. 
</P>
<P>
"Can you explain what it's supposed to do?" 
</P>
<P>
"No." 
</P>
<P>
She knew that he could. He had explained it very well last week, after she had 
directed him to books about electricity. The project showed that he did know 
how an electric light works. He just hadn't been able to make it happen. Maybe, 
she thought, she could help him now. 
</P>
<P>
"Robert, if you took a little longer now, it might work." 
</P>
<P>
"No," he squeaked, still looking at the floor. 
</P>
<P>
His jeans looked dirty. The sleeves of the heavy sweat shirt he'd begun wearing 
since the onset of warm weather were too long. The cuffs half covered his dirty 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't have time now to work with him on the project. She had to get back 
to the gym. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the light bulb was broken, and she didn't know where to find another in 
a hurry. She'd take him to the office and leave him there and try to forget 
about him for a while. 
</P>
<P>
No, she couldn't do that. 
</P>
<P>
She'd take him to the gym and let him join his classmates and hope that the 
rest of this day would pass quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Robert seemed to recover fast. He ambled around the gym, making snaky movements 
with his hands in the manner of the dancers in a then-popular TV video, done to 
a song called "Walk Like an Egyptian." 
</P>
<P>
Chris' recovery took longer. 
</P>
<P>
The fair ended with a ceremony after lunch. The parents had departed. The 
children sat in a huge, disordered phalanx on one side of the now dusty floor, 
and the teachers sat on chairs facing them. It was almost over. 
</P>
<P>
Al Laudato, the principal, roared for quiet. Chris started giggling behind her 
hand. "Oh, God, our leader," she murmured to another teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the wave of giddiness passed and she wiped her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
The team of Alice, Judith and Margaret got first prize. Arabella got the 
third-place ribbon and came bouncing up to get it. Chris felt glad that those 
children's parents had helped them. Claude's team got a ribbon for special 
effort. That was even better, because Claude had earned it all by himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my God!" said Claude, receiving his ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
Chris watched, and she smiled. She imagined Claude thinking, "I can't believe 
this! I got a prize!" 
</P>
<P>
But Chris stopped smiling when she turned her eyes toward Felipe. He was 
scowling. Felipe's team hadn't won anything. She glanced at the faces of Jorge, 
Ashley, Kimberly, Courtney. The faces of the losers looked not exactly sad but 
distant. 
</P>
<P>
As more fortunate classmates took the ribbons, many of the losers watched with 
slightly opened mouths, like children gazing through the window of a toy store. 
</P>
<P>
If she could, Chris thought, she'd give them all prizes. She'd go to Al 
tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
They couldn't let this happen again next year. 
</P>
<P>
Even the most troubled children had attractive qualities for Chris. Even the 
most toughened, she always felt, wanted to please her and wanted her to like 
them, no matter how perversely they expressed it. 
</P>
<P>
She belonged among schoolchildren. They made her confront sorrow and injustice. 
They made her feel useful. Again this year, some had needed more help than she 
could provide. There were many problems that she hadn't solved. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't for lack of trying. 
</P>
<P>
She hadn't given up. 
</P>
<P>
She had run out of time.

LETTERS TO MY MOTHER-IN-LAW: : SON DESIRES BASEBALL, NOT BULLETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON BOORSTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the third in an occasional series of columns written by a 
thirtysomething father trying to make sense of raising two young children in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Skeeter, 
</P>
<P>
You'll be happy to know that, in the spirit of glasnost, Eric won't be getting 
any war toys this year. This is not a matter of principle. Eric hasn't asked 
for any. Last year, if you remember, he had his heart set on GI Joe's "Rolling 
Thunder," three feet of death incarnate, complete with MIRV'd ICBMs. I'd always 
felt war toys were a reasonably harmless way to work out aggressions, but even 
I drew the line at nuclear missiles. Or so I thought, until I found myself 
coming home from Toys R Us with my own home delivery system. I told myself they 
were conventional warheads. 
</P>
<P>
Leni, you'll be happy to know, washed her hands of it. Fine by me. This was boy 
stuff, I said. She reminded me her brother John works for Council for a Livable 
World, lobbying for a nuclear-free America. I couldn't even have a nuclear-free 
household. 
</P>
<P>
But so what. Eric glowed and bubbled. He'd achieved his heart's desire, one 
full yard of total destruction. But to my surprise, he didn't much want to wage 
war with it. I nudged him into having a couple of battles -- he'd take the 
cream of his warriors and leave me the dregs and castoffs to fight him with, 
the broken ones or the cheap imitations. The battle was a one-sided slaughter, 
but, even then, he didn't like losing any men. The whole encounter was a series 
of timeouts while he rearranged his men. 
</P>
<P>
For Ariel, of course, nuclear weapons are not a holiday issue. Her idea of a 
good time is playing tea party, or playing mom. She knows how to use her dolls; 
timeouts are not what her games are about. She'll go on for 20 minutes at a 
stretch play-cooking or play-feeding and play-disciplining her wayward 
children. If play is practicing for the real world, she's a past master. 
</P>
<P>
Is her preference for make-believe homemaking nature or nurture? She's my 
princess and all that, but when I sit and let her feed me plastic cookies, I 
feel less like I'm pushing her into this than like I'm being sucked in against 
my will. She has a much better sense of what being a girl is than I do. I'm 
along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
Buying presents has been tough this year. They haven't been hounding us much, 
so we don't know what they really need. (I suppose need is the right word.) 
Ariel considers clothes presents, up to a point. Clothes for her dolls count of 
course, and, at almost 5, she is on the cusp of Barbie-hood with its endless 
requirements of Barbie-condos and Ferraris and Jacuzzis, but it's still all 
very tentative. Eric has a pet Nintendo game he wants, but there's no real 
desperation behind his plea. 
</P>
<P>
So we've got sort of a free ride this year. You too. But Eric has made one 
request, which it's my job to honor: he wants me to get him a $12 baseball 
card, any $12 baseball card. I know, you'll think it's outrageous -- what's a 
7-year-old need a $12 baseball card for -- but I'm doing it. See, I feel 
responsible for hooking him on cards. 
</P>
<P>
He got the itch from his friend Adam, but I scratched it. Watching him suck up 
those statistics was so exciting. He doesn't know what a percentage is, of 
course, but he knows who has the highest ones, and I prodded him into making up 
his own all-star teams. He goes for players with the biggest lifetime numbers, 
which is gratifying for me, since they're all the old-timers. Nolan Ryan is his 
prize card. He's told me he wants to beat Hank Aaron's record for homers when 
he grows up. I told him I'd be in the stands cheering when he did. 
</P>
<P>
I didn't just prod. What I did was buy my own cards and trade with him. Partly 
this was to compensate for my feeble attempts at card collecting when I was a 
kid, but I told myself I had a good, sound reason -- I was teaching him the 
meaning of a deal. I'd be fair but firm. And trying to make an even deal became 
as much of a game for Eric as trying to find the strikeout leader. The sides 
had to balance. With any marginal difference on his side, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
We had a lot of fun at this, and Eric has spent more time with his baseball 
cards than just about anything he's got. I wonder, though, if I've been doing 
well by him. When he gets to trading with his friends, I'm afraid I've set him 
up to be a sucker. If I was getting him ready for the real world, shouldn't I 
have really skinned him once or twice? Then he'd know what to look out for. But 
maybe he's better off learning that from his friends. 
</P>
<P>
All the trading was kind of pointless, too. When I was a kid you had to trade 
to get what you wanted. Now marketing has triumphed. Want just the Dodgers? You 
can buy them all for a couple of bucks. Want the All Stars? They're packaged 
too. You can even send in $15 and buy the whole kit and kaboodle. Where is the 
glory? Where's the pleasure in cheating the fates? We've been given so much 
choice that we don't have the chance to want something we can't get. 
</P>
<P>
But Eric hasn't been beating on me for the full set. He wants that $12 card, he 
says, because he wants a special card and he figures $12 is a lot of money but 
not too much. In other words, it's what he thinks I'll spring for. I've got to 
admit he's figured it damn close. So I got him a Topps 1966 Don Sutton (not 
'65, that would be his much more valuable rookie year) to go with the 1988 Don 
Sutton he traded me for. Side by side they're something to see. Kind of my own 
life in a Topps mirror. 
</P>
<P>
So it's baseballs not bullets this year. This morning, as I helped Eric strap 
himself into his shoes, I realized we hadn't talked once about what was going 
on in Eastern Europe. So I tried to tell Eric about the Berlin Wall, and the 
Cold War, and he asked me earnestly what a Communist was; he listened to my 
explanation, attentive but not completely engaged, as if he were listening to 
something which didn't really involve him. And I realized that with luck he 
would be right, it wouldn't involve him. I told him to remember that Wall, that 
he was alive when it was torn down. And maybe this year, if there isn't any 
more peace on Earth, at least there's more good will towards men. 
</P>
<P>
So you can tell John that his sister Leni promises him that 1990 will find us a 
nuclear-free household. 
</P>
<P>
Ever your loving son-in-law, Jon

REINDEER? THIS SANTA FLIES BY PLANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
McGRATH, ALASKA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Alaska National Guard Lockheed C-130H rolled to a stop in this remote 
community, small children behind a fence chanted at the top of their voices: 
</P>
<P>
"Santa! Santa! Santa! We want Santa Claus!" 
</P>
<P>
When Santa Claus walked down the back ramp of the plane, 60 boys and girls 
bundled in colorful parkas, fur hats, warm clothing and boots dashed through 
the snow to greet the white-bearded man in the red and white suit. 
</P>
<P>
They nearly knocked Santa off his feet as they ran into his arms. 
</P>
<P>
But the kids in this remote city, which is 275 air miles from Anchorage, 
haven't seen Santa for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year the C-130H couldn't land here. It was 50 to 75 below zero a week 
straight, and the village was gripped by an ice fog," said McGrath Mayor Glen 
Hanway, 40, a carpenter, who was glad the National Guard "arrived on a balmy 
day with the temperature only 10 below zero." 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids were really disappointed last year," he said. "They're sure excited 
today, as you can see." 
</P>
<P>
Half the children greeting Santa were Athapascan Indians. McGrath is at the 
northern end of the Kuskokwim River, embraced by the rugged Kuskokwim Mountains 
deep in Alaska's interior. No roads lead to the tiny village, so Santa flies 
into McGrath. For the last 30 years, the Alaska National Guard has been 
bringing Santa Claus and Christmas gifts to children in the Alaska bush. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers' aid Grace Holmberg, 44, said the "boys and girls hardly slept a wink 
last night. They were so excited. Poor Brandon Boyers, 4, was up all night 
listening for the C-130H to arrive. He was so hyper he got sick and had to stay 
home and miss Santa." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Claus presented each small child at the village airstrip with a gift and 
a candy cane. They all had an opportunity to tell him what they wanted for 
Christmas and how good they had been the last couple of months. Some slipped 
Santa letters. 
</P>
<P>
"I watch the Northern Lights at night when I bring the wood for the fire into 
the house for (my) mom. I make hot chocolate for my mom when she is cold. I do 
lots of things for my mom and my three sisters," wrote Leonard, 9. Jamie Lee 
Evan, 4, gave Santa a bead bracelet she made. 
</P>
<P>
"How many houses you go to? Are your elfs working hard? Where's Rudolph and 
Dasher?" wrote Curtis, 8. 
</P>
<P>
Judy John, 27, and her husband, Gabriel, 28, drove through the snow to the 
airstrip on their three-wheeler, carrying their son Christopher, 2, and their 
daughter Jennifer, 1, in their arms . 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time my babies have ever seen Santa Claus," said Judy John. 
</P>
<P>
The faces of many of the boys and girls were speckled with red spots. "We just 
got over an epidemic of strep throat. Now chickenpox is going through the 
village. When somebody gets something here, everybody gets it," said Melody 
Strick, 27, holding her red-speckled daughter, Roberta. 
</P>
<P>
Gifts for the National Guard's Santa Claus Airlift are donated to the Salvation 
Army in Anchorage. Volunteers at the Salvation Army wrap the gift and set one 
aside for each child in 33 isolated bush communities. 
</P>
<P>
The National Guard makes flights to a dozen remote villages that have airstrips 
large enough to accommodate the C-130H. Then from those dozen villages, 
including St. Lawrence Island near the Soviet border, the remaining gifts are 
delivered to smaller and even more isolated communities by National Guard 
helicopters and by villagers in snowmobiles and dog sleds. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Claus on the McGrath flight was Sgt. Steve Quintana, 39. Originally from 
Oxnard, Calif., where he graduated from Channel Islands High School in 1968, 
Quintana has lived in Alaska 15 years and has been an Army National Guard 
helicopter mechanic 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Flying the C-130H from Anchorage was Capt. Will Thayer, 47, full-time Air 
National Guard pilot and member of the 144th Tactical Air Lift Squadron. 
</P>
<P>
His co-pilot was Capt. Burton Powers, 29, who flies for Northwest Airlines and 
lives in Yakima, Wash. Powers grew up in Alaska and flies here to put in his 
National Guard time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in the Alaska Guard because you can't get to do stuff like the Santa Claus 
Airlift in the lower 48 or see this kind of spectacular country. Flying low 
over these rugged, snow-covered mountains, glaciers, and frozen rivers and 
lakes is seeing what Alaska is all about," said Powers. "It's the most 
beautiful country on earth. 
</P>
<P>
Also along on the flight were Jos Govaars, 55, Steve Owen, 37, and Wayne 
Froderberg, 42, and his wife, Tris, 42, all captains in the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
After Santa distributed the gifts, many of the children visited the cockpit of 
the military plane. "Did Santa fly this plane?" one youngster asked. "What are 
all these buttons for?" queried Jessie Grady, 11, who said he was going to be a 
National Guard pilot when he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids in these remote villages really know airplanes. Most have flown in an 
airplane a number of times but have never been in an automobile," said Powers. 
</P>
<P>
As the crew readied the plane to taxi off the runway, Santa stuck his head 
through an opening on the top of the plane and yelled, "Merry Christmas."

<P>
In last week's Commercial Scene column on major office buildings for sale, 
Daishin Kyouritsu Co. was incorrectly identified as the buyer of 9107 Wilshire 
Blvd. in Beverly Hills. Wilshire-Doheny Associates Ltd. is buyer of record; 
Daishin U.S.A. Co. Ltd. is a principal and managing general partner. Also, sale 
of 9000 Sunset Blvd. by Pacific Financial Group has not closed, but is pending 
close of escrow. Panorama City's Panorama Towers was incorrectly identified as 
an investment of Pacific Financial; it is owned by Panorama Enterprises, and is 
not for sale, according to principal Arthur Blech. And Winthrop Financial of 
Boston says its share of Irvine's Park Place is not for sale -- despite reports 
by several local brokers to the contrary.

GREAT DIPLOMACY AWARD 
</P>
<P>
To Club Postnuclear. The day before it was scheduled to go before the Laguna 
Beach City Council for a beer permit, Postnuclear staged a free noontime 
concert by the Dead Milkmen. The show attracted a rowdy, overflow crowd that 
disrupted neighboring businesses and ensured a strong dose of ill will at the 
council hearing. The beer permit was shot down, hobbling the brewless 
Postnuclear in its attempt to become a regular concert venue. 
</P>
<P>
FELIX UNGER AWARD 
</P>
<P>
To Timbuk3's fastidious road manager. Opening for Timbuk3 at the Coach House, 
the Swamp Zombies found themselves yanked off stage in mid-set for the crime of 
spilling some beer on a stage rug laid out for headliner Timbuk3. The spill was 
the accidental result of using a beer bottle as a percussion instrument. 
</P>
<P>
CHILD WELFARE AWARD 
</P>
<P>
To Rod Stewart. At the Pacific Amphitheatre, Rod the Mod had a small boy 
brought out of the audience to lend atmosphere to the father-son benediction, 
"Forever Young." When the kid's bit was over, Stewart went on with his show 
without first seeing to the youngster's safety. The untended tot teetered until 
his father gathered him down from the stage.

THEATER / MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't the greatest year for local theater, with only a handful of 
productions standing out as memorable. With that qualifier, here are my best 
picks for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
PROFESSIONAL 
</P>
<P>
"You Never Can Tell": South Coast Repertory's handling of this early Shaw play 
had a tartly comic sway that served it well. 
</P>
<P>
"Gypsy": This traveling show starring Tyne Daly brought some rousing energy to 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center. Daly put her own signature on the 
role created by Ethel Merman. "Hard Times": Five actors played 19 characters in 
this imaginative, technically fine SCR stage version of Charles Dickens' 1854 
novel. 
</P>
<P>
SMALL AND COMMUNITY 
</P>
<P>
"Ain't Misbehavin' ": The Orange County Black Actors Theatre played this 
tribute to Fats Waller with plenty of sass. 
</P>
<P>
"The Glass Menagerie": A muted and sensitive treatment of Tennessee Williams' 
classic was offered by director Marla Gam-Hudson at the La Habra Depot 
Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Showboat": Director Rob Barron found the right current, brisk but not 
turbulent, in Fullerton Civic Light Opera's production of the Jerome Kern and 
Oscar Hammerstein musical. 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 
</P>
<P>
"A Streetcar Named Desire": UC Irvine, under William Woodman's able direction, 
did justice to Tennessee Williams' masterwork of erotic vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
"Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street": This Rancho Santiago College 
production lagged at times, but the strong cast was still able to tap into its 
moodiness and dark humor. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bald Soprano": The Rancho Santiago College Professional Actors 
Conservatory's approach to this seminal "theater of the absurd" play had its 
flaws but was still clever enough to satisfy. Besides, it was refreshing to see 
Eugene Ionesco for a change. 
</P>
<P>
WORTH MENTIONING, 
</P>
<P>
IF FOR THE WRONG REASONS 
</P>
<P>
"Heat": Way Off Broadway in Santa Ana has a reputation for quirkiness, even 
when it presents something of merit. But the tiny playhouse outdid itself with 
this jaw-droppingly bad play about a Charlie Manson-style murderer who writes a 
novel called "The Guitar That Tortured Women" -- in his free time. 
</P>
<P>
"Night of January 16th": Ayn Rand took time off from postulating her 
"objectivism" philosophy to pen this hopelessly muddled courtroom whodunit. 
It's not clear why the L.P. Repertory Dinner Theatre decided to revive it. This 
was a mistrial all the way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CLASSICAL MUSIC AND DANCE / CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
<P>
BEST PERFORMANCES 
</P>
<P>
Guest conductor Vakhtang Jordania conducting the Pacific Symphony in 
Shostakovich's monumental Fifth Symphony at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center in Costa Mesa in March. 
</P>
<P>
The Vienna Chamber Ensemble setting standards in chamber music playing in an 
Orange County Philharmonic Society-sponsored program at the Center in April. 
</P>
<P>
Riccardo Muti leading the Philadelphia Orchestra in a pair of concerts 
sponsored by the Philharmonic Society at the Center in May. 
</P>
<P>
The Kirov Ballet in a reconstruction of Petipa's "Le Corsaire" at the Center in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Foster, first of this season's guest conductors vying for the open 
music director's position with the Pacific Symphony, at the Center in October. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Ballet in Balanchine's "Theme and Variations," Jerome Robbins' 
"Interplay" and Jiri Kylian's "Forgotten Land," at the Center in October. 
</P>
<P>
The Lewitzky Dance Company bringing the first modern dance to be presented on 
the Segerstrom Hall stage, Lewitzky's "Nos Duraturi" (to Stravinsky's "Symphony 
of Psalms"), with the Master Chorale of Orange County led by William Hall, at 
the Center in October. 
</P>
<P>
WORST PERFORMANCES 
</P>
<P>
The Johann Strauss Orchestra of Vienna offering flat-footed three-quarter-times 
playing in an Orange County Philharmonic Society-sponsored program at the 
Center in January. 
</P>
<P>
New York City Opera's numbing production of Mozart's "Die Zauberflote" at the 
Center in January. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Clark leading the Pacific Symphony in a conjectural "reconstruction" of 
Beethoven's "Tenth" Symphony, from the composer's sketches and fragments by 
Scottish musicologist Barry Cooper, at the Center in February. 
</P>
<P>
Clark leading a stupendously dull account of Bruckner's Ninth Symphony in a 
curious substitute program for the originally announced -- but cut for cost 
reasons -- Verdi Requiem that also enlisted soprano Aprile Millo in several 
arias by Verdi, at the Center in April. 
</P>
<P>
The Imperial Bells of China offering a Valentine-sweet, quasi-folk culture 
program on the very day that Chinese troops moved in to massacre the 
democracy-movement supporters in Tien An Men Square, at the Center in June. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
<P>
Here are my first ever Oranges and Lemons award winners for the local dining 
scene, and boy, was 1989 ever busy. 
</P>
<P>
BEST MEAL 
</P>
<P>
To the Robert Mondavi Food and Wine Center in Costa Mesa and guest chef 
Jean-Pierre Vigato of Apicius Restaurant in Paris, for a November dinner of 
leek terrine, lamb, and a carmelized apple dessert to die for. If this is 
representative of what the center has in store, I'm pitching a tent on their 
grounds. One loud bravo and four oranges. 
</P>
<P>
BEST NEW RESTAURANT 
</P>
<P>
Kachina, in Laguna Beach, is the hands down winner here. Oh, the ambience may 
be self-consciously trendy (Santa Fe crossed with Melrose Avenue) and some 
dishes may be a little too precious for their own good (grilled quail salad 
with papaya chutney), but I still love the place. Owner David Wilhelm is a real 
creator. Let's hope he doesn't get wanderlust. Three and a half oranges. 
</P>
<P>
MOST WELCOME ADDITION 
</P>
<P>
Kitayama of Newport Beach. As an authentic gaijin in Tokyo, I came to love 
seasonal Japanese specialties such as stews, casseroles and finger foods. At 
long last we have Kitayama, a Japanese restaurant where sushi is not the 
featured player. Three oranges. 
</P>
<P>
BEST CAREER MOVE 
</P>
<P>
Early in the year, chef Andrea Rogantini (of Rex in Los Angeles and Milan's 
Marchesi) was an unhappy camper, a corporate leash around him in the kitchens 
of Tuttomare. Today he is doing it his way at Bagatta, and nobody does it 
better. Three oranges. 
</P>
<P>
MOST CONSISTENT 
</P>
<P>
If quality and consistency are the cornerstones of the restaurant business, 
Hans Prager understands the masonry. The Ritz is one restaurant where you can 
depend on the kitchen, the service staff, even the parking attendant. Prager, 
an old-fashioned Viennese taskmaster, never forgets a face. Two and a half 
oranges. 
</P>
<P>
MOST DISAPPOINTING 
</P>
<P>
Gustav Anders was one of the best restaurants in San Diego County before 
relocating to South Coast Plaza, but a restaurant cannot live in the past. No 
one doubts chef Ulf Strandberg's ability to cook (a delightful bar menu, 
wonderful smoked fish) but the diffident service, erratic main courses and high 
prices are making many of the restaurant's fans impatient. Two lemons. 
</P>
<P>
MOST OVERPRICED 
</P>
<P>
Five Feet Too in Fashion Island is the sequel to Five Feet, a Laguna Beach 
Chinese restaurant where the high prices seem more justifiable. Owner Michael 
Kang has plenty of good ideas, but an inexperienced team of cooks makes it 
virtually impossible for him to deliver. Three lemons. 
</P>
<P>
WRETCHED EXCESS 
</P>
<P>
This is a special award given to the many investors who backed the astronomical 
number of new Italian restaurants in the area. Some of them aren't bad but, hey 
fellas, they can't all make money. I'm awarding four lemons because you may 
need them to cut down food costs before next year is out. 
</P>
<P>
WORST NEW FLAVOR 
</P>
<P>
The chowder cook-off at the San Clemente Pier looked like great fun for the 
crowds who showed up, but they didn't have to judge it. I haven't had a bowl of 
chowder since. Twenty south county restaurants participated, and I'm not naming 
names. So if it's chowder you want, try Kennebunkport, or opening a can. Four 
lemons. 
</P>
<P>
MOST DISTURBING TREND 
</P>
<P>
The explosion of franchises. What ever happened to the mom-and-pop restaurant? 
</P>

RANDY LEWIS: STATE OF THE ARTS: COUNTY HAS ECONOMICS DOWN TO A SCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's reassuring to know that the wheels of government do move forward, however 
leisurely the pace of progress may be. 
</P>
<P>
One year ago, when asked whether the County of Orange would ever earmark any 
money for arts support, Supervisor Thomas F. Riley told The Times, "I think 
it's a great idea." 
</P>
<P>
That admonition came shortly after the Orange County Arts Alliance, an advocacy 
agency created by the supervisors in 1974, voted to disband. When it died in 
1988 from lack of interest, it left the county's already Scrooge-like level of 
support for the arts at precisely zilch. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, we were told at that time, attention to the arts would have to take a back 
seat to other more pressing problems, such as homelessness, poverty, crime and 
the need for a better baggage-claim area at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in the blink of an eye that's taken only 12 months, we get the word from 
Mr. Riley that maybe the county should be doing more for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
More, presumably, even than the supes' latest plan to use paintings or 
sculptures or, who knows, topiary shrubbery shaped like Michelangelo's "David" 
as part of a scheme to class up the new John Wayne Airport terminal once it 
opens. Whenever that may be. 
</P>
<P>
So now they are trying to figure out what kind of action "more" means. Perhaps 
by next year at this time, we'll have the results from a blue-ribbon committee 
appointed to study the problem. Or short of that, at least the names of those 
appointed to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
I sometimes wonder whether, if God had been serious about testing Abraham's 
faith, He wouldn't have merely ordered him to kill his son, Isaac, but rather 
would have insisted that Abe wait around while a Heavenly subcommittee explored 
the options for Isaac's future. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, there's little need to waste a lot of time and resources debating 
where any future county money should go. If it's a dire need that affects all 
Orange Countians that the supes are looking for, the best place to spend it is 
in arts education. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, there's already a foundation for support of that position: arts 
education was the one issue raised time and again by county residents who 
attended a recent series of town meetings sponsored by arts officials who hope 
to establish a new group to foster arts on a countywide basis. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, it's just common sense: If you aim to have an arts-savvy populace 10, 
20 or 50 years hence, you better be darned sure that your kids can tell a 
trombone from a trompe l'oeil. 
</P>
<P>
It's no secret to anyone that since the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, most 
public arts education programs have been left looking pretty anorexic. 
</P>
<P>
It's admirable that individual organizations like the Orange County 
Philharmonic Society and Pacific Symphony have outreach programs in which they 
sponsor performances periodically for schoolchildren, but in no way can they 
make up for the absence of the daily exposure to music, dance, art or theater 
activities that can make a young creative spirit take flight. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, we've seen tangible proof of the value parents place on a quality arts 
experience in the example of Fountain Valley High School students and their 
parents who plucked money out of their own pockets, held car washes and other 
fund-raisers to retain the services of one excellent choral music teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Art, providing a direct expression for the human soul that can be rapturous as 
well as horrific, is as indispensable a component of a full and complete 
education as the more easily quantifiable skills such as reading, writing and 
'rithmetic. 
</P>
<P>
Surely in a time when as a nation, even as a planet, we are faced daily with 
ethical, political, social or moral quagmires, we can't afford to say it's a 
"frill" to provide the next generation with a thorough grounding in the forum 
where human values and experience play a central role. 
</P>
<P>
How does that translate into county money for bad orchestras or choirs made up 
of preteens? 
</P>
<P>
Well, you have to start somewhere, and it matters not whether some, or even 
most, students don't go on to make careers in the arts. In fact, that's exactly 
the point: Familiarity with artistic expression makes any life richer, not just 
the one that is devoted to it full-time. 
</P>
<P>
On a practical level, in the long run we'll all be better off if, as an 
audience, we can grow beyond a simple attraction for the show-biz glitter of 
jet-setter celebrity performers and recognize the worth of genuine artists. 
Just think: In such a world, Richard Thompson would have zillions of fans and 
Andrew Lloyd Webber would be struggling in a nightclub somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
On a grander scale, I'd submit that the more value -- humanity-wise, not just 
dollar-wise -- we attach to arts awareness, the better our culture will be. 
</P>
<P>
Is there anyone who can hear the words of Rostand, through the character of 
Cyrano de Bergerac, and not truly feel the nobility of virtuous self-sacrifice 
winning out over vain self-indulgence? 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who can watch the wondrous wedding of movement to the music of George 
Balanchine and not marvel at the beauty of body and soul as one? 
</P>
<P>
Or, for that matter, anyone who can listen to Neil Young sing about a welfare 
mother abandoning an unwanted baby and not rage at the injustice? 
</P>
<P>
Obviously it's vital to teach Johnny to read so that he can understand words on 
a page. But when looking for culprits behind the seeming crisis in values 
plaguing our world, we'd be well off to provide Johnny with some method of 
gleaning some meaning from those words. 
</P>
<P>
Honorable supervisors, the ball's in your court.

In sports: The Rams travel to Massachusetts to take on the New England Patriots 
today at 1 p.m. The Rams, at 10-5, can make the playoffs as a wild card with a 
win. Even if the Rams lose, they will still qualify if the Minnesota Vikings, 
the Green Bay Packers or the Washington Redskins lose. The Rams have won five 
of their last six, including road victories against New Orleans and Dallas. The 
Patriots are 5-10 but have won three of four games with the Rams -- including 
the last two -- in 1983 and 1986.

HOLIDAYS COMPOUND TURBULENCE FOR FEARFUL FLIERS; 
</P>
<P>
PHOBIAS: JOYOUS SEASON CAN BE FRAUGHT WITH TREPIDATION FOR PLANE PASSENGERS WHO 
FEEL FORCED TO MAKE CHRISTMASTIME TRIPS.

<TEXT>
<P>
It may be the season to be jolly, but it didn't seem like it in the waiting 
rooms at John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
One woman's hands were clenched so tightly that they were turning pale. Another 
woman was trying to doze but continued glancing nervously around the room. A 
man was concentrating on a magazine but hadn't turned a page for nearly five 
minutes. Many others were chewing gum intensely. 
</P>
<P>
Glen H. Arnold recognizes these symptoms. He is a social worker and counselor 
at UCI Medical Center who specializes in combatting the anxieties of flying 
demonstrated in holiday-packed airports around the country. Holiday flying may 
be the most stressful of all, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone afraid of flying can conceal his fears from friends and minimize them 
to family members. It's easy to justify a car trip to Yosemite rather than 
flying to New York for vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"But the holidays bring lots of social obligations and pressures. You get 
invited places," Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
"And there are plenty of people in Southern California who are drawn back to 
the East or Midwest, by guilt feelings, to see elderly parents and families for 
the holidays. It may be the only time they ever consent to fly, because there's 
no way to beg off." 
</P>
<P>
The anxiety starts, Arnold said, as soon as you make your reservations; an 
undercurrent of stress that is easy to deny at first. But the nervousness 
builds as the days lead up to departure, and you go sleepless the night before. 
</P>
<P>
That morning you forgo breakfast, ensuring that your stomach will be empty and 
ticklish. You arrive at the airport and start drinking coffee and smoking, 
which sets your nerves to jangling. 
</P>
<P>
You feel irritable. Your companion, who knows nothing of your fear of flying, 
has been reading travel brochures and says, "Hey, they have an aerial tram 
there. Let's try it." Your stomach knots. 
</P>
<P>
You head for the bar and find it amazingly crowded for this time of morning. 
Two drinks, and you are a little tipsy, but just as nervous -- and now your 
stomach is angry. 
</P>
<P>
You head for the waiting room and see the metal detectors blocking your way, 
ready to buzz and demand explanations. But you pass through, the first of 
several transitions that make it more difficult to back out. 
</P>
<P>
They call the flight, you walk to the plane, you take your seat, and then they 
do the most symbolic and terrifying act of the flight: They close the door! Now 
it will require an act of excruciating embarrassment in order to back out, and 
few of the fearful do it. Now there are four or five hours of stress and 
anxiety ahead. 
</P>
<P>
A 1987 Gallup poll found that 48% of airline passengers are at least 
occasionally afraid. Arnold estimates that for more than two-thirds of them, 
the anxiety stems from more than merely being on an airliner in flight. 
</P>
<P>
"Guilt in family relationships takes people to places they don't want to be," 
he said. "This can manifest itself as anxiety and fear. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, when we feel guilt, we shop for punishment. You subject yourself to 
anxiety and fear during a flight, and when you arrive, you're worn out, but you 
feel relief. You've paid your dues. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps a person feels vulnerable in a relationship or at work. He can, 
without realizing it, transfer that feeling of vulnerability to an airplane 
going through turbulence.

"And you can use fear of flying as a weapon in a family power struggle. She can 
use her flying problem to frustrate his plans, and he can spring plans on her 
at the last minute to cause the maximum anxiety." 
</P>
<P>
Those whose fears are based on misinformation are easier to help, Arnold said. 
Their mental images of flying can be adjusted toward reality, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A person who views an airliner as being precariously high with nothing between 
it and the ground can be helped to view air as a powerful force, as substantial 
as the water that buoys a ship. The plane can be viewed as protective rather 
than confining. And, they can be reminded, air crashes are less likely than car 
or train crashes. 
</P>
<P>
"People always behave appropriately based on what they think is true," Arnold 
said. "People's perceptions can be shifted." 
</P>
<P>
In either case, Arnold said, fearful fliers can learn to at least tolerate 
flying with less discomfort by not expecting flights to be utterly trouble-free 
and by not expecting their anxieties to disappear all at once. 
</P>
<P>
"There are strategies that can be learned and practiced. If you are 10% more 
comfortable on your next flight than on your last one, you're on your way," he 
said.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: OUTSIDERS ANALYZE THE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are outsiders who dismiss Orange County as a bastion of Republican 
conservatism -- the land of fringe politicians, right-wing extremists and 
wealthy residents who are overly stingy with their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County residents hate it when that happens. 
</P>
<P>
They say it's not fair to generalize about Orange County, that today it has a 
rich ethnic diversity and a cornucopia of ideas, and it is struggling with all 
the problems of a major metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the bible that political insiders often use for such shorthand analysis 
is the National Journal's political almanac, which contains descriptions and 
score cards for every member of Congress. The descriptions include a lengthy 
narrative about each representative's home district. In the almanac, Orange 
County residents concerned about their image nationwide will find both good 
news and bad. 
</P>
<P>
There are three congressional districts -- all represented by Republicans -- 
that are wholly contained in Orange County: Robert K. Dornan's 38th District in 
the north, William E. Dannemeyer's 39th District near the center of the county 
and C. Christopher Cox's 40th District in the south. Here are some excerpts 
from the national experts' view of the county as presented in the Almanac of 
American Politics 1990: 
</P>
<P>
The 38th District: "A new America has been created within the Orange County 
grid in the most rapid metropolitan growth of the post-World War II era. . . . 
(But) to its critics, Orange County came to be synonymous with the white middle 
class and its values, among which were assumed to be racism and callousness 
toward the poor, a mindless nationalism and hawkishness, and a lamentable taste 
for middlebrow kitsch, symbolized by Disneyland in Anaheim and Robert 
Schuller's Crystal Cathedral with its drive-in annex in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"There was some basis to these characterizations as Orange County was growing. 
. . . But as time went on, Orange County turned out to be less homogeneous and 
more open to change than its critics supposed. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . As Vietnamese refugees began arriving in large numbers after the fall 
of Saigon, many headed for the county which had always staunchly supported 
fighting for their freedom from Communism. The refugees have proved themselves 
hard workers, with every family member pitching in. . . . The largest 
concentration of Vietnamese in America today can be found along the Garden 
Grove and San Diego freeways in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
The 39th District: "What kinds of suburbs are these? It's a mistake to think of 
Orange County as just a collection of suburbs. . . . In their grid patterns and 
square moral outlooks, in their comfortable but far from showy affluence and 
their industriousness, in their apparent ethnic homogeneity and their adherence 
to traditional family patterns, they resemble those Midwestern towns 40 and 60 
miles away from Chicago, which are classified as part of the Chicago 
metropolitan area by the Census Bureau but in their own residents' minds are 
places apart. 
</P>
<P>
"These places also share a strong allegiance to the Republican Party and a 
conviction that they represent the typical American community." 
</P>
<P>
The 40th District: "Near Newport Beach are the 1,000 acres the Irvine 
developers donated for a local branch of the University of California; at the 
edge of the property a once-small airstrip has become John Wayne Orange County 
Airport; just to the east is Costa Mesa's South Coast Plaza, the 
highest-volume, upscale shopping center in Southern California. . . . 
</P>
<P>
" . . . This is almost uniformly an affluent area. The subdivisions are walled 
off from the surrounding roads and freeways. . . . The underlying street 
patterns, however, are geometrical, as if people were trying to impose a 
predictable order on the lush and unpredictable landscape of mountain, coast 
and desert. . . . But Reagan's themes of traditional values and technological 
progress remain highly popular. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly any quick description that tries to grasp the essence of a community 
may be less than satisfying to the subjects. But at least they didn't dismiss 
Southern California culture as "laid back." 
</P>
<P>
I hate it when that happens.

15-YEAR-OLD HURT IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 15-year-old boy was wounded by gunfire during an evening drive-by shooting in 
a residential neighborhood, a police spokesman said. The youth, whose identity 
was being withheld, was hit once in the leg, said Lt. Steve Ames. He added that 
it was not known if the attack was gang related. "Normally these things are, 
but we don't know the specific circumstances," Ames said. Ames said that the 
youth was standing with a group of friends at the corner of Washington Avenue 
and South Park Lane late Friday. As the boy walked away, he heard gunshots in 
the neighborhood. Suddenly he spotted a large brown car, possibly a Ford LTD, 
rounding the corner at Washington and Park, Ames said. An unidentified man 
leaned out the passenger window and fired a handgun at the boy, Ames said. "The 
victim jumped over a fence" to escape the gunfire, Ames said, "but he was shot 
in the rear of his left thigh." Ames added that police were investigating the 
incident. No one else was reported shot in the attack.

DRUNK-DRIVING CRACKDOWN NETS 39 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A first-ever coordinated drunk-driving crackdown in North Orange County 
resulted in 39 arrests Friday night and early Saturday morning. About 70 police 
officers in Buena Park, Fullerton, La Habra, Brea and Placentia were assigned 
to search for drunk drivers. The officers covered about 85 square miles of the 
county north of the Riverside Freeway. La Habra police arrested 11 people 
suspected of driving drunk, the highest number among the five departments. Brea 
police arrested 10 of 3,096 motorists stopped at a sobriety checkpoint. 
Fullerton police arrested four people, less than a typical holiday weekend 
night, Sgt. Douglas Cave said Saturday. "We look at this as a success," Cave 
said. "The people obviously got the word and stayed off the streets." Before 
the crackdown, police distributed 2,500 flyers to bars, restaurants and 
shopping centers warning of the special police effort. Fullerton made one of 
the earliest arrests, Lt. Bud Lathrop said. Police arrested a man at noon 
Friday who apparently had left a holiday office party, he said. "He got an 
early start," Lathrop said. "His driving was so alarming, people were calling 
us . . . from pay phones and car phones. It didn't take any clever police work 
to catch him." In addition to the arrests resulting from the crackdown, four of 
the nine traffic collisions in the North County area Friday night and Saturday 
morning ended with a driver being arrested on suspicion of drunk driving, Cave 
said.

SCIENTIST SAYS EARLY STATE MEDFLY ATTACK MAY HAVE LOST WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with an infestation that won't go away, a leading scientist says the 
government may have made a critical error in its battle against the 
Mediterranean fruit fly this summer by ordering aerial pesticide spraying 
before the true size of the pest population was known. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Cunningham, a U.S. Department of Agriculture Medfly expert in Hawaii and 
chairman of the scientific panel advising the current Medfly eradication 
program, said the rapidity with which malathion-bearing helicopters were 
launched may have, ironically, masked the true size of the infestation and 
provided a false sense of confidence that the problem had been solved. 
</P>
<P>
If the infestation in the Whittier area in October were as large as evidence 
now seems to indicate, the spray might have killed only 90% of the population. 
That still would have left enough of the pests alive to spread, Cunningham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We blinded ourselves with the bait spray," he said. "We must have had a 
sizable population at the start. We did not appreciate that. Maybe in hindsight 
it would have been better to wait and evaluate the situation" before going on 
the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County has been doused twice with malathion in the last month. The first 
aerial spraying on Nov. 30 followed the discovery of a single pregnant Medfly 
in a guava tree in Brea. On Dec. 6, agricultural officials found three fertile 
Medflies in La Habra Heights, and on Dec. 12, they resprayed a 26-square-mile 
area that included parts of Brea, La Habra and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
A Medfly was also trapped on Dec. 8 in Westminster, about 10 miles south of the 
La Habra infestation. But officials decided not to spray Westminster now 
because the trapped fly, while fertile, was not pregnant. Instead, they tripled 
the number of traps to see if more flies appear. 
</P>
<P>
The experts believe there are several reasons that the pest has been spreading. 
These reasons include people carrying infested fruit out of the Medfly 
quarantine zone. But Isi Siddiqui, assistant director of the California 
Department of Food and Agriculture's Division of Plant Industry, said much of 
the spreading infestation in the central Los Angeles area today emerged from 
the Medfly hot spot in the Whittier area, found on Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
That infestation zone was sprayed on Oct. 4, only eight days after the initial 
find. By that time 61 flies had been found. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved too fast," said Cunningham. He said the original population in 
Whittier must have been very large, but no one will ever know how large because 
of the speed with which treatment was begun. He admitted there is always a 
danger that the infestation will spread while waiting.

TRAVEL TIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glen H. Arnold, a counselor who specializes in treating the fears of people who 
fly, says holiday travelers can take these steps to reduce anxiety before and 
during a flight. 
</P>
<P>
BEFORE THE FLIGHT 
</P>
<P>
* Pack early to minimize departure-day stress. 
</P>
<P>
* Beginning 24 hours before departure, avoid or minimize stimulants such as 
caffeine, nicotine and sugar. Eat foods closer to their natural states, such as 
fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains. 
</P>
<P>
* Set the mood early on the day of departure by listening to a relaxation 
cassette before getting out of bed. 
</P>
<P>
* Wear loose, comfortable clothing. Wearing slippers and layers of clothing you 
can remove if necessary are good ideas. 
</P>
<P>
* Give yourself lots of extra time to get to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
* Check Christmas gifts like you do your luggage so you won't have to struggle 
with them on board the airplane. 
</P>
<P>
* Take a portable audiocassette player and familiar, relaxing recordings. A 
relaxation cassette is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
* Take healthy snacks such as trail mix or dried fruits to eat during the 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
* Set a goal for each flight, such as making the flight 25% more comfortable 
than the previous one. 
</P>
<P>
* Make a "flight plan" -- how you expect to spend your time during the flight. 
Breaking long flights into smaller units provides a feeling of greater control. 
</P>
<P>
DURING THE FLIGHT 
</P>
<P>
* Accept the fact that airliners encounter air turbulence about 10% of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
* Keep your seat belt on all the time you're in your seat, and make it as snug 
as possible without affecting your breathing. This minimizes body movement 
during turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
* In turbulence, visualize how a block of Jell-O would react and let yourself 
yield similarly to the motion. If you grab something and stiffen your body, you 
exaggerate the discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
* It is critically important to maintain a feeling of control during the 
flight. You can't control air turbulence or the airplane; concentrate on 
controlling your reactions. 
</P>
<P>
AFTER THE FLIGHT 
</P>
<P>
* Did you achieve your goal? Any improvement is an advance. Reward yourself in 
some fashion. STEVE EMMONS

MIKE PENNER: EVERETT HAS MORE THAN PLAYOFFS RIDING IN FINALE

Suppose you were putting together a football team for one big game. Suppose 
your opponent had Boomer Esiason, Eric Dickerson, Christian Okoye and Bruce 
Smith. Suppose you wanted to win this game. 
</P>
<P>
Who do you pick to be your quarterback -- Jim Everett or Don Majkowski? 
</P>
<P>
When confronted with this simple quiz, the playing membership of the National 
Football Conference either flunked or flipped a coin or flipped its wig, 
because the vote went to Majkowski. 
</P>
<P>
Care to make it two out of three? 
</P>
<P>
People must be suckers for guys nicknamed Magic. Or Majik. Especially when this 
one plays for Green Bay, whose last quarterbacking star was a Starr. After a 
deep freeze, the Pack is almost back and Majkowski's passing yards are 4,086 
good reasons why. 
</P>
<P>
But if anyone has had a better season than Everett, his name is Montana -- and 
Bay Area Joe already has a berth on the NFC Pro Bowl roster. 
</P>
<P>
If Majkowski warms hearts, Everett stops them. John Elway's legend is 
mountain-high because of one drive against Cleveland in the 1986 AFC 
championship game, but in the past two months, Everett has had five of them. 
Back from the dead against San Francisco, New Orleans and Dallas. To the brink 
of victory against Buffalo and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
With a little defense, Everett would be 5-0 in those games and playing for the 
NFC West championship today. 
</P>
<P>
Without Everett, the count is very likely 0-5, leaving the Rams out in the cold 
long before their plane touched down in New England. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, the Rams can make the playoffs on their own accord with a victory 
this afternoon, which is more than Majkowski's Packers are able to say. 
</P>
<P>
If that isn't enough to gain Everett admittance to the Pro Bowl, well, he 
shouldn't brood long. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, Everett will be able to buy the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
In the final days of his current contract, Everett has picked a fine time to 
become a free agent. We won't argue here that Everett is the best quarterback 
the Rams have ever had, although the evidence is mounting. We will, however, 
say with total confidence that Everett is about to become the most expensive 
quarterback to wear the horned helmet. 
</P>
<P>
Before Everett, no Ram had thrown for 4,000 yards in a single season. Not Norm 
Van Brocklin, not Bob Waterfield, not Roman Gabriel, not Vince Ferragamo. 
</P>
<P>
Everett has 4,129 yards -- and one game to go. 
</P>
<P>
Before Everett, no Ram had thrown more than 30 touchdowns passes in a single 
season. Everett had 31 in 1988 and with a league-leading 28 touchdown passes 
this season, he could do it again. 
</P>
<P>
Everett also has completed 59.5% of his passes -- 59.7% is the Ram record -- 
and his quarterback efficiency rating of 93.2 ranks third in the league behind 
Montana and Esiason. 
</P>
<P>
Want more? 
</P>
<P>
 -- In his past two seasons, Everett has passed for 8,093 yards -- or more than 
the entire Ram careers of James Harris and John Hadl, combined. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 3 1/2 seasons as a starter, Everett already ranks fourth on the club's 
career passing list with 11,175 yards. Only Gabriel (22,223), Van Brocklin 
(16,114) and Waterfield (11,893) have more. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With Everett as starting quarterback, the Rams have yet to score fewer than 
10 points in any game. With Dieter Brock, the Rams did that three times in 1985 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
Before Everett, Eric Dickerson was the highest-paid Ram in history at $686,000 
in 1987. Look for Everett to triple that, if the Rams wish to enter the '90s 
with him on their side. 
</P>
<P>
As Randall Cunningham and Bernie Kosar recently established, the going rate for 
prime-time NFL quarterbacks is $2 million per year. Everett also will seek some 
security. Does $14 million for five years sound out of line? 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Mark Langston, Everett already has proved he can pitch in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Coming this winter, the Everett contract negotiations will be bigger and better 
than anything Dickerson ever conspired or desired. And well they should be. 
When the Rams lost Dickerson, they plugged in Greg Bell and kept the 1,000-yard 
seasons rolling. 
</P>
<P>
If they lose Everett, are you prepared for the Mark Herrmann decade? 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Dickerson debacle, the Rams will have a few advantages when they 
deal with Everett. For one, Everett is a nice guy. For another, he wants to 
stay in Anaheim and hasn't told anyone lately to go run 47-gap. Lastly, 
Everett's agent, Marvin Demoff, has a decent relationship with Ram vice 
president John Shaw, no minor detail. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, Everett's salary drive begins today. Beat the Patriots and it's on to 
the playoffs. Win again and the ante goes up. The higher the round in January, 
the higher the ground come February. 
</P>
<P>
No Ram quarterback has won a Super Bowl, so that's something for Everett to 
shoot for. Better yet, it's something Everett can take care of with his own 
hands and his own Rams. 
</P>
<P>
To get into this bowl, all you need are victories, not votes.

FOOTBALL: NEBRASKA SOPHOMORE MIKE PETKO HAS MATURED AND EARNED A STARTING SPOT 
AT LINEBACKER FOR THE 6TH-RANKED CORNHUSKERS.

When Kevin Steele became the inside linebacker coach at the University of 
Nebraska last spring, his first job wasn't to coach football players, but to 
try to discipline one. 
</P>
<P>
"My first assignment was Mike Petko," Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
It seems Petko, a freshman linebacker, was stirring up quite a fuss in Lincoln, 
Neb., a city where it's only supposed to stir on football Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
As Petko remembers it, he was leaving a bar in Lincoln one night when he bumped 
into a guy who apparently didn't care much for linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe he just didn't like Petko's brash attitude, mohawk haircut or his 
earring. 
</P>
<P>
Petko, 6-feet-3, 240 pounds, exchanged a few not-so pleasantries with the 
fellow. And before you could say misdemeanor assault, someone was laying on the 
ground, minus a few teeth. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't Petko. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I knocked out about eight of his teeth," Petko said. "He had to have 
some plastic surgery too." 
</P>
<P>
Assault charges were eventually dropped against Petko, who said he was only 
defending himself. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Steele knew he had a problem. When they met, Petko was engrossed in a 
copy of the book, "The Boz." 
</P>
<P>
"He treated that book like a Bible," Steele said. "He had that wild haircut, 
wore polka-dot balloon pants and wild sunglasses. His dialogue was very much 
that brash linebacker style." 
</P>
<P>
Petko, the California bad boy from Servite High School, was making quite an 
impact at Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
He was the second-leading tackler on the junior varsity, but also was among the 
leaders in eye gouges. 
</P>
<P>
Steele wasn't impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like Mike was at a crossroads in his life," Steele said. "He was trying 
to play a role of what he thought the linebacker image was supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I did was clarify what his role was. I told him if he lived 
his life to the extreme, with the wild haircuts, the wild dress and earrings, 
he would be recognized by people, but they (would) grow tired of him." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to think of myself as causing more injuries (than he suffers). I like 
to see guys' eyes roll back in their heads when I hit them. It gets me charged 
up. I like to turn it up and get wild a little bit. You play tough man's 
football here in the Big Eight. I busted a few fingers my senior year at 
Servite, but here I average one a game. I found out the real meaning of pain 
when I came here." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Petko 
</P>
<P>
It has been nine months since Petko met Steele, and Petko's talking tough while 
preparing for Nebraska's Fiesta Bowl game Jan. 1 against Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
After all, he's starting at linebacker as a sophomore. And that's not an easy 
accomplishment when you play for the sixth-ranked team in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
But Petko has changed. His mohawk haircut and earring are gone. "The Boz" is 
tucked neatly on a bookshelf back in Lincoln. There are no more fancy clothes, 
although he has added one new piece to his wardrobe -- a knee brace. 
</P>
<P>
Petko had heard all of Steele's speeches about maturity and staying out of 
trouble. Now all that talk was starting to hit home. 
</P>
<P>
Petko was learning all about pain. 
</P>
<P>
He strapped the red fiberglass brace, which stretched from mid-shin to his 
thigh, around his right knee. It's a constant reminder of his last tackle, the 
one he made on Colorado quarterback Darian Hagan in the fourth quarter of a 
27-21 loss on Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Petko remembers the play: 
</P>
<P>
"It was was an option on Colorado's last play of the game. Hagan went outside 
and I picked him up. He cut back and I met him and wrapped him up. Then (nose 
guard Mike) Murray grabbed his legs. When we went down, Murray landed on my 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard my knee rip. Then more people piled in and I heard it pop and rip 
again. People around me were nauseous. It was instant pain. I was wondering if 
I would walk again." 
</P>
<P>
Petko tore ligaments in his knee as well as the muscle behind it. Doctors 
placed him in a temporary cast, suggested surgery and told him to stay off the 
knee for three months. 
</P>
<P>
Playing in the Fiesta Bowl, they told him, was out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
Petko wouldn't listen. 
</P>
<P>
"I had it instilled in my mind that it can't stop me," he said. "I can't let a 
little knee injury blow me out. 
</P>
<P>
"My outlook on everything is to live for the moment. If my number is up, it's 
up. I know I'm risking it. Another hard hit could put me in a wheelchair." 
</P>
<P>
Petko told the Nebraska coaches they would have to take away his shoulder pads 
to keep him from playing. Brave talk, especially for the rehabilitation that 
lay ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Forty hours after the injury, Petko cast aside his crutches and was back in the 
weight room, working on his upper body and left leg. Two weeks later, he was 
jogging. 
</P>
<P>
Petko sat out the Huskers' next two games, against Kansas and Oklahoma. He had 
trouble watching from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike is a very intense person," Steele said. "That's a big advantage sometimes 
for a linebacker. But he also overreacts to things. He was down emotionally and 
the Oklahoma game was really tough for him." 
</P>
<P>
Petko sought comfort from his stepfather, Dave Petko, a Santa Ana policeman, 
and his father, Bill Harris, a former tight end with the Dallas Cowboys now 
living in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Harris knew how his son felt. His pro career ended with a knee injury at the 
end of his first training camp. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad called me and gave me a lot of encouragement," Petko said. "He kept 
reminding me that I had to have a future outside football. That stuck with me." 
</P>
<P>
With an extra five weeks off between the Oklahoma game and the Fiesta Bowl, 
Petko has worked his knee back into playing shape. Barring any more injuries, 
Petko will be in the starting lineup on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be like any other linebacker. I want to be the nicest guy 
possible, off the field. On the field, I don't want people to recognize me. I 
want people to say: 'Who is that dirty, rotten guy?' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Petko 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska wasn't the first place where Petko overcame problems. He was a 
standout as a football and baseball player at Servite but struggled in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of politics at Servite," Petko said. "They were going to 
flunk me in religion, of all things. I had the impression that they were just 
using me for football there. When football season was over, that was it for me. 
I said that was fine." 
</P>
<P>
He transferred to Katella for the second half of his senior year. His 
grade-point average at Servite was 1.9 on a 4.0 scale, just shy of the academic 
requirements under Proposition 48. 
</P>
<P>
His grades improved at Katella and his speed (4.7 seconds in the 40) and 
hard-hitting play earned Petko scholarship offers from Nebraska, Colorado, 
Michigan, USC and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Dave Petko was apprehensive about sending his stepson to the Midwest. 
He wanted him to stay close to home and go to USC. But Dave Petko has changed 
his mind about the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I question if Mike could have done as well as he has if he had stayed on the 
West Coast," Dave Petko said. "He likes the fast cars and the night life, and 
there was plenty of that out here. He was forced to adjust in Lincoln." 
</P>
<P>
Part of Petko's change in attitude came academically. 
</P>
<P>
One of his favorite statistics this season isn't his 36 tackles, two fumble 
recoveries or his interception, but his 3.52 grade-point average in speech 
communication. As a result, he was named to the Big Eight's all-academic second 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "When things get tough, you've got to bite it in the butt and butt it with 
your forehead. It's that way for linebackers, and it's that way in life." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Petko 
</P>
<P>
Petko repeats one of Steele's favorite sayings. He learned just what it meant 
after he tore up his knee. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're on the field you have to be a little cocky and brash," Petko said. 
"I want to keep that kind of respect. But the injury emphasized to me that you 
can lose something and you can lose it fast." 
</P>
<P>
Steele laughs when reminded of the brash college freshman he once knew. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike understands that being different in a good way goes a lot further," 
Steele said. "He was just a little confused (last spring). I think he has grown 
up now."

OFFENSE THROWS CONKLIN INTO LIMELIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: WASHINGTON'S QUARTERBACK COLLECTS SCHOOL RECORDS AND CONFIDENCE WITH 
NEW ONE-BACK, QUICK-PASS ATTACK. 
</P>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
University of Washington quarterback Cary Conklin walked out to practice one 
day last spring and tried to make sense of Coach Don James' new offense. 
</P>
<P>
The one back, the quick pass, whatever the name, quickly became an enormous 
pain for Conklin. 
</P>
<P>
On the first day of spring practice, someone handed Conklin a new playbook, 
pointed to a set of receivers he'd never seen before and said, "Now get to 
work, son." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the offense is a quarterback's dream. Washington State had used it 
successfully under Dennis Erickson before he took it to the University of Miami 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
The offense gives the quarterback as many as five receivers, including the 
fullback, to choose from in short to medium range and, as Conklin soon learned, 
is difficult to defend. 
</P>
<P>
And James, unhappy after a 6-5 season in which the Huskies missed a bowl game 
for the first time in nearly a decade, junked the I-formation offense in favor 
of the wide open (read: exciting) one-back passing game. 
</P>
<P>
James also fired offensive line coach Dan Dorazio and replaced him with Keith 
Gilbertson, who added some flair to an offense that ranked seventh in the 
Pacific-10 in 1988. Gilbertson, who was the head coach at Idaho for three 
seasons, was among the first to develop the one-back offense. 
</P>
<P>
Conklin couldn't have been happier, at least until it came time to work out. 
</P>
<P>
A knee injury sidelined Andre Riley, the only veteran receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, we didn't know if we were doing the smart thing (changing the 
offense)," James said. "He was throwing to a lot of new faces." 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy period of adjustment, Conklin became comfortable with the 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, we had to learn it because we had a game in a few days," Conklin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A school-record 2,569 yards passing later, Conklin has finally mastered the 
one-back offense, leading Washington to a 7-4 record and a spot in the Freedom 
Bowl against Florida Saturday morning at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
His passing yardage broke Sonny Sixkiller's single-season school record of 
2,303 set in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Sixkiller's record stood through almost 20 years of outstanding Washington 
quarterbacks. Warren Moon couldn't break it, neither could Chris Chandler, Tom 
Flick, Hugh Millen or Steve Pelluer. 
</P>
<P>
"When we recruited (Conklin), he looked a lot like the rest of the kids we've 
had success with," James said. "Moon, Flick . . . he's as good as any of them." 
</P>
<P>
Conklin, 6-foot-4, 215 pounds from Yakima, Wash., is quick to credit the 
Huskies' new offense for his record-breaking season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the offense of the '90s," Conklin said after practice Friday at 
Golden West College. "They (defenses) don't know when you're going to throw the 
quick game at them or go with the longer stuff. Usually we have four receivers 
and one running back, but sometimes we have five receivers and no running back. 
The whole idea is to mix it up with the run. It's a fun offense to watch." 
</P>
<P>
And, to hear Conklin tell it, an exciting one to play. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to stop," he said. "No one really stopped it all year. They only 
time we were stopped is when we stopped ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Said James: "Any quarterback who's a thrower would like it. If he just had 
another year with the offense . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Conklin is a fourth-year senior, which is rare in these days of 
redshirt-mania. 
</P>
<P>
James and Conklin agreed the quarterback would redshirt his sophomore season in 
1987. But when Chandler was injured the week of the Arizona game, James had no 
one else to turn to. 
</P>
<P>
The game ended in a 21-21 tie with Conklin throwing two touchdowns. It was just 
the confidence boost he needed. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since that game I knew I had the ability," Conklin said. "The last two 
years I've been real successful and it goes back to that game. That game gave 
me a lot of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Conklin remembers having mixed feelings before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to ruin my redshirt year," he said. "But then again I was tired 
of practicing. I wanted to get out there and show what I could do." 
</P>
<P>
Chandler returned to the lineup quickly and Conklin was back on the bench. But 
there was little question who the starter would be after Chandler graduated. 
</P>
<P>
As a junior, Conklin passed for 1,883 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But his senior season began under happier circumstances. In the opening game, 
the Huskies upset 15th-ranked Texas A&amp;M as Conklin completed 23 of 37 for 
224 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The year has not been without pitfalls, however. Washington lost three 
consecutive games before meeting Oregon in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied at 14 in the third quarter, Washington had possession on 
the Ducks' one-yard line. Conklin, trying to wriggle his way into the end zone 
on an option, caught his foot in the artificial turf as he spun and pulled a 
lower abdominal muscle. 
</P>
<P>
Washington won, 20-14, but Conklin was hurting for the next month. 
</P>
<P>
"I could barely walk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Conklin played anyway, leading Washington to four victories in the final five 
games to gain a berth in the Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The highlights of Conklin's season was a 28-27 victory over UCLA. Still 
bothered by the pulled muscle, he played poorly in the first quarter as the 
Huskies trailed, 21-0, before rallying in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 27-21 with 3:12 remaining, Conklin led the Huskies to the winning 
touchdown on a 78-yard, 10-play drive. He completed five of seven passes on the 
drive, which ended on Greg Lewis' 10-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got in the huddle and said, 'Somebody's got to come up with some big 
plays,' " Conklin said. "There was never any doubt in my mind we'd score." 
</P>
<P>
That's just an example of Conklin's confidence, Riley says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the poise he has, the self-confidence in the pocket that makes him so 
good," said Riley, Washington's leading receiver this season with 53 catches 
for 1,039 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Since that Arizona game his sophomore season, Conklin's confidence has never 
wavered through offenses, old or new. It just took time to adjust to the new 
one.

INDUSTRIES THAT POLLUTE ARE FACING LOTS OF DIRTY WORK

<TEXT>
<P>
George J. Smith may be one of the few corporate environmental managers in 
Orange County who can look ahead to next year with equanimity. His company, an 
Anaheim-based computer circuit board manufacturer called Aeroscientific, has a 
state-of-the-art waste treatment system, and top management made a strong 
commitment to environmental protection several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The wave of new rules on air and water pollution, hazardous waste disposal, 
garbage recycling and other environmental issues that will be implemented 
during the year ahead therefore shouldn't cause any severe disruptions for 
Smith and his firm. But the same cannot be said for many other Orange County 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
1990, in fact, could go down as the year that Southland companies really 
changed the way they think about environmental protection. The regulations that 
come into effect in 1990, combined with the establishment of specific targets 
for even more stringent pollution-reduction measures that will kick in later in 
the decade, will make it painfully clear that Band-Aid solutions are no longer 
a practical option. 
</P>
<P>
"Band-Aids have heavy operations and maintenance costs," noted Douglas K. 
Garfield, an associate in the Orange County office of Dames &amp; Moore, a 
large construction and engineering company that is experiencing huge growth in 
its environmental consulting business. "You can say, 'What do I need to do to 
respond to these specific requirements?' Or you can step back and start to look 
at everything, all your processes, in light of what is likely to occur." 
</P>
<P>
Regulatory Vise 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, what is likely to occur over the course of the next decade is a steady 
tightening of the regulatory vise which will severely limit the use of many 
common industrial chemicals and require substantial new capital investments in 
pollution control for companies ranging from large aerospace concerns to the 
neighborhood auto body shop. 
</P>
<P>
And what is a certain to occur in 1990 is a series of local, state, and federal 
regulations which will: 
</P>
<P>
* Bar the disposal of untreated hazardous wastes on land. 
</P>
<P>
* Require companies to catalogue emissions into the air of even small amounts 
of toxic chemicals, and then, in conjunction with regulatory agencies, assess 
the risk they pose. 
</P>
<P>
* Limit the ability of companies to install facilities which contribute to air 
pollution without first reducing pollution at existing facilities. 
</P>
<P>
* Further restrict the use of certain so-called "volatile organic chemicals" -- 
commonly used in paints and solvents -- and of the notorious ozone-depleting 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). 
</P>
<P>
* Establish new rules for the proper handling of medical wastes. 
</P>
<P>
* Mandate that much of the regular trash produced by businesses and residences 
be recycled. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of these measures on business is far from uniform, hitting some 
small manufacturing firms in businesses such as metal plating and painting very 
hard while leaving some larger, cleaner industries relatively unscathed. But 
few will escape entirely. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that next year will be a turning point, but there will be more 
regulations, more restrictions, and costs are going to escalate," said Duane 
Jordan, an active member of the Industrial Environmental Coalition of Orange 
County and an environmental manager at a large local manufacturing company. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most important measures to take effect in 1990 is the final phase of 
a state and federal prohibition on the land disposal of certain untreated 
hazardous substances. Known as the "land ban," the rule will require that all 
hazardous materials be treated even if they are being dumped in regulated 
hazardous waste landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Many dangerous substances are already subject to the land ban, but the third 
phase of the rule, set for implementation on May 8, will affect a number of 
materials -- such as heavy metal sludges -- that are not acutely toxic but are 
produced in great volume by industries such as electronics and metal finishing. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Department of 
Health Services are now scrambling to develop treatment standards for the 
various affected substances. If no standards have been established by May, or 
if adequate treatment capacity is not available, some wastes could be exempted 
from the ban. 
</P>
<P>
Forms of Treatment 
</P>
<P>
Treatment often involves a process called "fixation," in which the waste is 
solidified so that it will not leak into ground water, and some of the wastes 
affected by the land ban can be treated relatively easily. The cost burden on 
some smaller firms could nonetheless be significant enough to cause serious 
disruptions, or even desperate and illegal solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"I fear (the land ban) will lead to an increase in illegal dumping," said 
Robert Merryman, chief of the Environmental Health Division of the Orange 
County Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
To help small companies cope with the land ban, the Orange County Fire 
Department is developing an education campaign to help disseminate information 
on alternatives, said Karen Peters, head of the department's hazardous 
materials program. 
</P>
<P>
"The little guys get crunched, because they don't have a staff to analyze the 
waste streams," Peters noted. "We want to get as much information out there as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
Larger companies, meanwhile, are already taking a number of steps in response 
to the land ban. A McDonnell Douglas spokeswoman said the company is spending 
"millions" to revamp its hazardous waste disposal systems. The company is using 
fixation for some wastes, incinerating others, and increasing its efforts to 
recycle some hazardous materials and find substitutes for others, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The land ban may also force companies to begin planning for a September, 1991, 
deadline for evaluating all sources of hazardous waste and identifying specific 
waste reduction measures. Already, any company disposing of hazardous waste 
must certify that they have a waste minimization program in effect, but that 
rule is considered a mere formality. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to start getting ready for the source evaluation," predicted 
Gail Brice, vice president in the Orange County office of McLaren, an 
environmental consulting firm. "There will have to be a huge commitment to 
waste minimization programs." 
</P>
<P>
At Hughes Aircraft, a program called the "zero disposal initiative" has been in 
place since last year, according to environmental health manager Renzo Venturo, 
who added that the company is working to "change processes, change materials 
and change what we buy" to limit the amount of waste that needs disposal. 
</P>
<P>
A similar commitment is now being forced upon companies in regard to the 
emission of toxic materials into the air. A new state law requires all firms to 
conduct an audit of "air toxics," and next year regulators will begin to 
conduct "risk assessments" based on the results of those audits. 
</P>
<P>
Companies judged to be posing too great a risk to the surrounding communities 
-- the exact levels of acceptable risk for different substances will be 
established next year -- will be required to cut their emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Brice said that "enlightened" companies would begin preliminary risk assessment 
now, so they might be able to eliminate trouble spots before the state comes in 
and mandates what could be more dramatic and expensive action. "Now is the time 
to implement the plan," said Brice, who added that the aerospace, petroleum and 
electronics industries would be especially affected by the air toxics law. 
</P>
<P>
"To wait will be a lot more costly than doing it up front," added Garfield. 
</P>
<P>
It might be more difficult for companies to prepare for some of the 19 measures 
likely to be adopted next year by the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District as part of the comprehensive -- and controversial -- Air Quality 
Management Plan approved last March. The proposals are now in draft form and 
are likely to be approved by the AQMD board in 1990 as part of the first phase 
of the broad, three-phase effort to bring the Los Angeles basin into compliance 
with federal air quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more arcane, but potentially most influential, of the AQMD measures 
has to do with changes in the "new source review" requirements for emissions 
from factories and other stationary sources of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, any new or existing company that wants to bring a polluting facility 
on-line has to "offset" any new pollution by reducing pollution from an 
existing source, if emissions from the new plant exceed a certain threshold. If 
the company cannot reduce pollution elsewhere, it can purchase offsets on the 
open market from a company that has reduced pollution without opening new 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Fuel Conversion 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed new rules, which the AQMD board is expected to decide on in 
March, the minimum threshold for offsetting would be eliminated, meaning any 
new source would require offsetting reductions, explained an AQMD spokesman. 
Moreover, all outstanding offset credits would be discounted by 80%. And that's 
in addition to the general requirement to use the best available technology to 
control emissions from any new source. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD will also be considering a number of initiatives for future 
implementation, including measures to require operators of vehicle fleets to 
convert to cleaner fuels, rules to further controls on emissions and wastes 
from bakeries and dry cleaners, new restrictions on release of gases from small 
boilers, and a complete phase-out of fuel-oil use by local utilities and other 
power generators. 
</P>
<P>
Several other AQMD proposals could impose further rules governing the use of 
volatile organic chemicals (used in paints, solvents, and many other 
applications) and chlorofluorocarbons. CFCs have been banned in aerosol sprays 
for more than a decade, but they are still widely used in air-conditioning 
coolants and as a solvent for cleaning electronic components. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Irvine, in a widely publicized move last July, imposed its own 
total ban on CFC use within the city, and that measure is scheduled to take 
effect July 1. Local electronics companies, however, say they are in good shape 
to comply with the rule. "We are getting rid of some of our CFC-based products, 
replacing them with an aqueous cleaning product that's like soap and water," 
said John Olson, vice president of manufacturing at the personal computer maker 
AST Research. 
</P>
<P>
Olson added that the company supported the CFC ban, and that it didn't 
anticipate problems with other new environmental rules. A Western Digital 
spokesman said his company was committed to working with the city on the CFC 
issue, and that it is currently seeking an exemption to use a CFC substitute 
that has a less severe impact on the ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the local level, the county and cities will be working to develop 
recycling programs for regular residential and business trash in accordance 
with a state law requiring a 25% reduction in the amount of garbage shipped to 
landfills by 1995, and a 50% reduction by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
And though there are no specific new rules this year, a major concern for many 
local companies will be cleaning up ground water and soil polluted by recently 
removed underground storage tanks. In the real estate industry, even greater 
vigilance is expected regarding possible contamination problems and liability 
on any property that changes hands. 
</P>
<P>
The state government will not be idle either, as it moves to pass new 
legislation governing the handling and disposal of infectious medical wastes. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Clean Air Act 
</P>
<P>
And on the federal level, Congress is expected to pass next year the 
long-delayed reauthorization of the Clean Air Act. The impact of the 
legislation in California will be limited, because a key part of the 
legislation deals with the Eastern and Midwestern problem of acid rain, and 
because air pollution standards in California generally exceed federal 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
But the exact shape of the legislation could have a major impact on the type of 
regulatory policies adopted throughout the country over the next decade, 
because state and local policy makers often follow the lead of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"Congress will have to decide whether to micro-manage the controls on every 
smokestack, or whether to go with an enforceable market incentive plan," said 
Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund. "How that 
debate goes will effect not only how the acid rain rules are written, but also 
the type of environmental laws that get passed in the future." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION 
</P>
<P>
Numerous government bodies are involved in implementing environmental 
protection policies. Many pollution problems involve more than one agency, and 
in those cases a "lead agency" will usually be designated. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: 
</P>
<P>
Federal agency that enforces such federal environmental laws as the Clean Air 
Act, the Clean Water Act and the Resource Recovery and Conservation Act. 
</P>
<P>
California Department of Health Services: 
</P>
<P>
State agency with overall responsibility for many state environmental laws. Key 
divisions include the Toxic Substances Control Division and the Environmental 
Health Division. 
</P>
<P>
California Air Resources Board: 
</P>
<P>
Responsible for regulating automobile emissions and overseeing implementation 
of state clean air laws and the policies of the regional air quality districts. 
</P>
<P>
California Water Resources Control Board: 
</P>
<P>
Responsible for regulating the use and quality of surface and ground water, and 
overseeing the activities of the regional water quality control districts' 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Air Quality Management District: 
</P>
<P>
State-chartered agency covering Orange County and four others, the AQMD has 
authority to set and enforce rules for all stationary sources of air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Water Quality Control Districts:: 
</P>
<P>
Two state-chartered agencies have the authority to set and enforce rules 
protecting water quality in the county. The Santa Ana district covers North 
County; the San Diego district, South County. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Water District: 
</P>
<P>
Responsible for supplying water. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Health Care Agency: 
</P>
<P>
The agency's Environmental Health Division enforces regulations regarding 
handling and disposal of hazardous waste, storage of hazardous materials in 
underground tanks, ground water cleanup projects, and oversees clean-up of 
hazardous waste spills. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Sanitation District: 
</P>
<P>
Permits and regulates discharge of waste water to the sewage system, and 
operates sewage treatment plants, in most of the county. Local sanitation 
districts have responsibility elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County General Services Administration: 
</P>
<P>
Operates landfills for regular trash and has general responsibility for solid 
waste disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Fire Department: 
</P>
<P>
With 16 local fire departments, the county department regulates the storage and 
handling of hazardous materials, and performs emergency response.

<TEXT>
<P>
Not everybody likes Andrew Lloyd Webber. 
</P>
<P>
The critics have roasted and trashed his music. The London tabloids made 
mincemeat of his romancing and marriage to Sarah Brightman. He has been called 
derivative, sentimental, superficial, unchallenging. 
</P>
<P>
None of this has made a chink in his platinum armor. This immensely popular, 
immensely affluent composer can do no wrong. Lloyd Webber bashing, the critical 
sport of the decade, has only strengthened the allegiance of legions of fans. 
Impervious to slings and arrows, his shows rake in the gold. 
</P>
<P>
No other composer has been as emblematic of the musical theatre in the 1980s. 
His style is Byronic, his works large, romantic and based in massive sets and 
complex effects. Lloyd Webber's megahits -- "Cats" and "The Phantom of the 
Opera" -- have straddled the '80s, redefining a faltering musical theatre as 
they went. Spectacle was the byword, snapped up by an undernourished market 
hungry for something Really Big. 
</P>
<P>
Bread and circuses or the Second Coming? No matter. Mauled by the critics, 
lionized by the public and, through it all, wildly, indecently successful, 
Lloyd Webber, the quintessential media object of the post-Warholian era, is the 
music man of the decade.
