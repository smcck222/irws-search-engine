ANXIOUS GROWERS BRACE FOR ANOTHER COLD FRONT; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: MOST COUNTY CROPS WERE SPARED MAJOR DAMAGE IN LAST WEEK'S COLD 
SNAP. STRAWBERRY PLANTS, HOWEVER, MIGHT NOT PRODUCE AS MUCH FRUIT THIS SEASON.

<P>
Al Steindorf gambled when he planted tomatoes, hoping to glean a winter crop 
from his Carlsbad fields. It was a farmer's version of a trip to Las Vegas, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He lost. 
</P>
<P>
Steindorf, an organic vegetable farmer, estimated he ditched about $30,000 in 
tomatoes that recently froze on the vine. 
</P>
<P>
"It was going great until this storm, and we had this killer frost," sighed 
Steindorf, who also lost about 15,000 young tomato plants growing in his 
Carlsbad greenhouse because of the cold. 
</P>
<P>
But most San Diego County growers appear to have been spared major crop damage 
from last week's cold front, although strawberry plants have dropped their 
blossoms and might not produce as many berries this season, the county 
Agriculture Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Steindorf and other farmers are trying to evaluate damage already done and to 
figure what the next weeks might hold. According to the National Weather 
Service, there will be no immediate relief as temperatures continue to drop at 
night and a frost advisory remains in effect. Around Thursday, a cold front 
from Alaska is expected to hit Southern California, and another storm is 
expected this weekend, said forecaster Harvey Hastrup. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, Christmas in San Diego is shirt-sleeve weather, but this year, I've 
been out in a parka and gloves," said John R. Moore, who runs Zany Acres, a 
small El Cajon herb and vegetable farm. "This winter will be tougher on growers 
because suddenly, we have to end the growing season." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, many farmers were able to continue harvesting produce until late 
December. This winter, however, frosty weather put the kibosh on the growing 
season early in the month. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a difference of four weeks. The average person says it's only four weeks, 
but four weeks to a farmer is a lot," said Moore, a farmer for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, the destruction from the cold has been minimal. A county 
inspector who looked at fields all over the county reported Monday that he had 
found little crop damage, said Marilyn Corodemas, chief deputy agriculture 
commissioner for the county. 
</P>
<P>
"It did get cold, especially Saturday night, but there was kind of a warm 
breeze," said Corodemas. "It was windy, and it wasn't real damp, and that 
seemed to have a warming effect on the crops. We were lucky." 
</P>
<P>
But a number of farmers are concerned about whether their luck will hold during 
this winter, which has been more severe initially than previous ones. Some 
farmers have resorted to using artificially generated heat, an expensive option 
that will probably be passed along to the consumer, they say. Others are trying 
various oil-based sprays to ward off frost. But organic farmers, like the 
Moores, can do little but keep an anxious eye on their crammed greenhouses. 
</P>
<P>
"The frost and cold, wind damage is really hurting," said Jeanne Moore, who 
works with her husband on their farm, which supplies a health food store and 
three restaurants with fresh produce. "It's getting to the point where it's too 
expensive to grow anything." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the small farmers are feeling the sting of the cold. Gary Iles 
estimated that he lost about 80% of his harvest from his 2 1/2-acre citrus and 
avocado farm in Fallbrook because of the recent cold. 
</P>
<P>
"I got fried," said Iles, who does not depend on his farm for his income. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers, however, worry not only about this year's profits but also about 
long-term damage to the plants. 
</P>
<P>
Charley Wolk, an avocado grower and former chairman of the county Farm Bureau, 
said his groves are showing some signs of cold stress, but the big chill's 
lasting effect won't be so easy to determine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not only the physical damage that might be done to the fruit, but you 
also impact the future production. Sometimes that's more expensive than what 
you actually lose," Wolk said. 
</P>
<P>
The cold puts stress on the plants, cutting fruit production. For instance, 
after three years of inopportune cold weather, a 2-acre avocado tract that Wolk 
farms near Rancho California produced only about 200 pounds of fruit last year 
-- a marked decrease from previous years. 
</P>
<P>
Wolk said he feels that the largest agricultural interests in the county, 
producers of nursery plants and cut flowers, also often are overlooked when the 
public assesses agricultural damage from cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
These growers accounted for $375 million in crops in the county in 1989, nearly 
double the next most valuable group of commodities -- fruits and nuts. 
</P>
<P>
But cold weather can hurt flower growers by increasing the cost of heating 
greenhouses and by resetting the plants' biological clocks so that they flower 
at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
"Their energy bills just go skyrocketing," Wolk said. "So cold spells can drive 
the growers right up to the point where they're going to operate for a year and 
make no profit. They sell their plants, and all they do is pay the energy 
bill." 
</P>
<P>
And flowers must be produced at the right time for the two biggest floral 
events of the year, Valentine's Day and Mother's Day. 
</P>
<P>
"You can produce a beautiful rose," he said, "but, if that sucker comes off the 
plant the Monday after Mother's Day, you might as well throw it in the trash 
can."

THIS FAMILY HAS ENDURED; 
</P>
<P>
DESPITE LOSS OF BUSINESS, JOB, KIDNEY DISEASE, SON'S ILLNESS, THE MACIASES 
STILL HAVE FAITH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In September, when her husband learned that he would probably lose his job as a 
VCR repairman, Kathy Macias thought that her family's incredible string of bad 
luck had run its course. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought nothing else can happen to us this year, because everything bad had 
already happened," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy, her husband, Juan, and the couple's six young children were looking 
forward to 1991. The new year, they hoped, was sure to bring them better times. 
</P>
<P>
But 1990 was not through with the Macias family. 
</P>
<P>
Just when the family learned about the impending layoff, just when Kathy Macias 
thought that nothing else could go wrong for her family, doctors told Juan that 
he was suffering from a potentially fatal kidney disease, focal 
glomerulosclerosis, that also afflicts his brother. 
</P>
<P>
His employer "told me that I was probably going to lose my job. Then the doctor 
told me that, if I hadn't come in when I did, the disease would have probably 
killed me in six weeks," said Juan. 
</P>
<P>
The disease struck Juan's older brother, Henry, eight years ago. The brothers 
both fell victim to the mysterious illness when they were 32 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Although they both suffered from kidney failure at the same age, Juan said 
doctors are not sure if the disease is hereditary or what its cause is. But 
doctors suspect the disease is inherited from a faulty gene passed on to them 
by their mother. 
</P>
<P>
Juan's illness confirmed their worst fears, said Kathy. He had been having up 
to 30 cramps daily, for several weeks, and complained of chronic fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
"When he went to the hospital for tests, I prayed to God that it wasn't kidney 
disease," said Kathy. 
</P>
<P>
The news was especially devastating for Juan because he has only one 
functioning kidney. Two years ago, he donated his right kidney to Henry, who 
lost both kidneys to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his predicament, Juan finds humor in his situation. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a very exclusive category," he said. "It's really rare for someone to 
donate a kidney and then have a kidney transplant. I'm one of a small number of 
people who can say he's been at both ends. It's an easier operation for the 
recipient." 
</P>
<P>
Juan's illness was only the latest blow to befall the Macias family this year. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the couple lost their video business and were left with a debt that 
will probably take 20 years to pay. In addition, 4-year-old Brian, who suffers 
from spina bifida and is paralyzed from the chest down, required hip surgery 
this year and was in a body cast for four months. The youngster has a twin 
brother, Paul, who is perfectly healthy. 
</P>
<P>
And, recently, the family's van required some expensive repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"This had already been a tough year for us," said Kathy. "It seems like 
everything has happened to us in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
Others might say that her family is facing a bleak Christmas. But Kathy thinks 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably going to be our best Christmas ever," she said. "True, things 
are awfully tough for us. But a lot of people who have heard about our 
situation have been so kind to us. Our Christmas tree was donated to us. The 
staff at Children's Hospital has helped us out with gifts for the kids. A 
teacher helped us out with Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner. Everywhere we 
turned, somebody was helping us. I consider ourselves very fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Macias, 32, seemingly unflappable, juggles Brian's thrice-weekly therapy 
sessions at Children's Hospital and Juan's dialysis treatments, also three 
times a week. Each treatment takes three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Their 10-year marriage has been solidified by the crises they have faced, the 
couple said. They met at the old Doctors Hospital, where Kathy worked as a 
nurse's aide. Juan, who was a baseball standout in high school and college, had 
gone to the hospital for an operation on his throwing arm. He said the 
California Angels were going to draft him, until they found out about his 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy conceded that the strength she found to face the challenges confronting 
her family was not always there. A combination of her Catholic faith and family 
support has led her through every crisis, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Money remains a problem. The family is living on Juan's disability payments 
from the state, but most of that is eaten up by the $334 health insurance 
payments they have to make every month. They were forced to give up their Mira 
Mesa apartment and move in with Juan's parents in Clairemont, where Juan, his 
brother and two sisters were raised. 
</P>
<P>
"When all of this crashed down on us, I couldn't get a grip. I was feeling 
depressed, because everything was caving in on us," said Kathy. "I don't know 
the reason for all this. We're part of a bigger and grander plan. Everything is 
wrapped around God's purpose." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Juan never lost his optimism. At the beginning of his illness, 
Juan's outlook clashed with Kathy's depression. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a few arguments about this," Juan said. "Money was tight. We have six 
children who still depend very much on us. I've always been a very positive 
person. I kept telling Kathy things would work out." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for the young couple, the Macias family pulls together in time of 
crisis. Juan's parents, brother and sisters are very close. His parents 
mortgaged their home to help Juan and Kathy start up the video business that 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
When the kidney that Juan donated to Henry failed, a younger sister, Maria, 
promptly donated her kidney to Henry. 
</P>
<P>
"Henry is walking around with three kidneys, and only one is functioning," 
laughed Juan. 
</P>
<P>
When Juan fell victim to the disease, an older sister, Linda Sturtevant, 
offered him one of her kidneys. In a telephone interview from her Moreno Valley 
home, Sturtevant said she has already passed the first battery of tests for a 
donor. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never given it a second thought. Doubt never crossed my mind. If I can 
help my brother, I will," said Sturtevant. "I have a great deal of faith. I 
pray every night for guidance and strength." 
</P>
<P>
Henry Macias, an electrical engineer for Bonneville Power in Wennatchee, Wash., 
expressed admiration for his brother. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother has fought an uphill battle. When I became ill, he stepped forward 
without hesitation," said Henry. "When you come close to your losing your life, 
you learn to appreciate life more. My brother gave me a second chance at life, 
and I got a third chance from my sister." 
</P>
<P>
If Sturtevant goes through with the operation, every one of Juan's siblings 
will be left with one functioning kidney. Donors and recipients have become so 
commonplace in the Macias family, that the procedure has led to a family 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a family thing," Kathy said. "If you donate a kidney, you get taken 
out for a dinner of steak and lobster. It's not a bad deal, a kidney for steak 
and lobster."

LAST-MINUTE SHOPPING HAS ITS MOMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
CHRISTMAS: A NEWBURY PARK MAN VISITED 10 PET STORES, CALLED 15 MORE AND 
CONTACTED VETS AND ANIMAL SHELTERS BEFORE LOCATING A KITTEN FOR HIS DAUGHTER.

<P>
So you looked all over and couldn't find Baby Alive, dead or alive? The stores 
were out of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Sewer Hockey your kid wanted? No 
end to Nintendos, but hardly a Barbie in town? 
</P>
<P>
Such hassles greeted many last-minute shoppers at Ventura County stores on 
Monday, the day before Christmas. But imagine how frustrated John Rooney felt 
as he spent hours trying to buy what most people can't give away. 
</P>
<P>
"Just try and find a kitten on Christmas Eve," said Rooney, 28, of Newbury 
Park. "I was amazed. I put it off to the last day because I figured kittens 
were everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
First he visited 10 pet stores in eastern Ventura County. Sold out, they said. 
Then he called 15 more stores from home, with the same result. Increasingly 
desperate, Rooney called a few veterinarians, then went to animal shelters in 
Agoura and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have taken anything, except one of those longhairs," said Rooney, who 
was shopping for his 9-year-old daughter, Brandy. And it had to be a kitten, 
not a full-grown feline. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Rooney tracked down a tiny Siamese in a Simi Valley pet store. 
</P>
<P>
Marcy Polier drove all the way from her home in Brentwood to the Janss Mall in 
Thousand Oaks. The Toys R Us store there is the only place she could find Baby 
Alive, a popular doll that teaches children about the digestive tract. 
</P>
<P>
But Polier wasn't buying the doll for her child. She wanted it for a little 
girl in East Los Angeles who had written a letter to Santa Claus. Polier got 
the letter through a Postal Service program and didn't want to disappoint the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
Customer traffic varied from store to store but seemed light overall 
considering the date. Many shoppers wandered aimlessly down store aisles, 
apparently waiting for inspiration to strike. 
</P>
<P>
Les Waas, acting president of the Philadelphia-based Procrastinators Club of 
America, said Christmas Eve shoppers experience less stress because stores are 
less crowded. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people who do Christmas shopping at the last minute do it a lot faster 
out of necessity," said Waas, an advertising executive who said his 
8,500-member club will hold a Christmas buying seminar on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if they feel stress, they feel it for a shorter period of time than 
people who spent weeks shopping. And the salespeople benefit because they get a 
lot of quick sales." 
</P>
<P>
Last-minute shopper Bobby Kunes, however, seemed a bit anxious as 6 p.m. neared 
and he still hadn't found a stuffed chow dog for his girlfriend. It was almost 
closing time at the Buenaventura Mall in Ventura when Kunes gave up. His 
girlfriend is getting a $40 gift certificate from a clothing store. 
</P>
<P>
It's her favorite store, Kunes said, but he added: "I may be in big, big 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Davin Cornett of Ojai decided to turn his procrastination into a practical joke 
on his wife Heather. 
</P>
<P>
While she waited in the promenade of the Buenaventura Mall, he left to buy her 
present. At 6:05, after all the stores had closed, he returned, glum-faced and 
apologetic. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the Hallmark and they ended up kicking me out of the store," he told 
Heather. "There weren't even any good cards left." 
</P>
<P>
But he had sneaked out to his truck and hidden a pair of leather boots that his 
wife will find under the tree this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"But maybe first I'll wrap myself up in a ribbon and say 'here's your present,' 
" Cornett said. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone did their shopping at a mall. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been very, very busy -- more than I expected," said Sharon Jensen, a 
cashier at the Assn. for Retarded Citizens' thrift store in downtown Ventura. 
Cold weather boosted the last-minute rush, she said. "We've been selling lots 
of long johns, heavy coats, blankets and sweaters." 
</P>
<P>
And not everyone spent Monday shopping. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Flores of Ventura took advantage of what one official called the slowest 
day of the year at the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured this would be the best day," said Flores, who was at the Ventura DMV 
office to register a boat his parents gave him for Christmas. About 15 workers 
staffed the gaily decorated office, outnumbering customers by a three-to-one 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
"People have so many other things to do today," said DMV Operations Officer 
Lucy Smith. She said she had already let some employees go home early. 
</P>
<P>
At the San Buenaventura Mission, music director Erin Holmes spent Monday 
afternoon getting the choir's sheet music ready for Midnight Mass. 
</P>
<P>
In honor of the mission's founder, Father Junipero Serra, the program included 
Christmas carols and hymns from the Baroque period when Serra lived. The choir 
was going to sing the Gloria portion of the Mass in Latin and conclude the 
service with Handel's "Hallelujah Chorus." 
</P>
<P>
Maureen Kuentzel and Cris Morris of Camarillo had the day off from their office 
jobs and decided to spend the day volunteering for some worthy cause. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the only place that called us back," Kuentzel said as she and Morris 
waited for lunches to deliver for the Meals on Wheels program. "We told them we 
were off work today and figured they might need us because a lot of people go 
out of town." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the Meals on Wheels kitchen in Camarillo, cook Velma Lerma and volunteer 
Hank Burgeson were dishing out a special Christmas Eve dinner for 1,050 of the 
county's elderly. The menu included ham (or roast pork for low-salt diets), 
orange-cranberry sauce, yams, green beans, a dinner roll, apple-raisin-walnut 
pie and a hot spiced fruit drink called wassail. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to order things in advance so we started planning about a month ago," 
said supervisor Jesse Keith. The kitchen was preparing another 125 meals to be 
delivered Monday night to the temporary homeless shelter at the National Guard 
Armory in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Cooking for 1,000 or more people is no big deal for Lerma. She was busy giving 
her co-workers paper plates full of cookies that she had baked at home. 
</P>
<P>
Many people picked up the holiday spirit at a liquor store. Rooney, for 
example, stopped by Wendy Liquor and Deli to get all the fixings for hot 
buttered rum. He was expecting about 20 friends and relatives to drop by on 
Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
At the Newbury Park Florist next door, Beverly Birch was closing up after 
delivering 27 poinsettias and other holiday arrangements. Flowers are popular 
with procrastinators, she said. "They don't have to deal with whether it fits 
or not."

Jeff Bernard acknowledges that there is some good-humored debate about the 
meaning of the three balls that hang above the doorway of Palace Pawnbrokers. 
</P>
<P>
Some people say the balls, long the symbol of the pawn industry, stand for Buy, 
Sell and Trade, said Bernard, the manager of the San Diego shop. Others quip 
that, if you borrow money at a pawnshop, leaving your valuables behind as 
collateral, the three balls are a reminder that "two to one, you won't get them 
back." 
</P>
<P>
But, on Monday, harried pawnbrokers around the county said the three balls 
might as well have been Christmas ornaments. From El Cajon to Lemon Grove to 
Oceanside, owners of hock shops reported a holiday surge in business sure to 
make most conventional retailers turn red and green with envy. 
</P>
<P>
At the pawnbrokers' well-lighted loan counters, people lined up to trade their 
belongings for last-minute shopping money -- usually 10% to 25% of an item's 
retail worth. And, as often as not, many turned around and spent their 
new-found cash before leaving the shops, reveling in the unusual selection and 
the rock-bottom prices. 
</P>
<P>
"I do all my Christmas shopping here," said Kathy Carpenter, an executive 
secretary from Mission Valley who spent part of Christmas Eve browsing around 
Royal Loan Pawnbrokers in Hillcrest. She proudly displayed a gold chain 
bracelet that she had bought for her boyfriend -- a $400 value, she said, for 
just $185. 
</P>
<P>
"Gold is gold. Diamonds are diamonds. What does it matter if it's been used?" 
she asked. "I'll never go back to a regular jewelry store." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, as area department stores and gift shops report lighter-than-usual 
holiday buying, Christmas cheer is alive and well at local pawnshops. According 
to shop owners, including several who have extended their hours to accommodate 
the new business, the recent economic downturn seems to have broadened their 
customer base. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hitting more the middle class as opposed to the lower-to-middle," said 
Marc Vogel, owner of We Lend More Inc. in National City, who says the last 90 
days have brought more requests for high-end loans. "More Rolex and Cartier 
watches (being pawned). Larger diamonds, larger loans. . . . We knew about the 
recession before the recession happened." 
</P>
<P>
"They seem to come in busloads," said Donny Kaufman, the owner of East County 
Pawn Shop in El Cajon, who claims to buy, loan, sell or trade "practically 
anything" of value. Kaufman also reported making more loans on everything from 
computers to compact discs. "People need money, more so this year than last 
year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard, who was serving champagne at his store Monday, attributes some of the 
rush to the fact that department stores, desperate for sales, have held their 
usual post-Christmas sales before the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"The stores are forcing people to spend now," he said. But, while they're in 
the pawnshop getting cash, it never hurts to look around -- at the autoharps, 
conga drums, encyclopedias, luggage, shortwave radios, weed whackers and 
wedding rings, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd rather give somebody a used Nintendo game than something else new that 
they won't use, right?" said Bernard. "You have to put things in perspective: 
If it works, it works. Quality is quality -- new, used or indifferent." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, it's not necessarily forever -- you have four months to reclaim your 
belongings. And it's fun to drive a bargain. Haggling is generally frowned upon 
in Robinson's or Nordstrom. But, at a pawnshop, it's encouraged -- especially 
if you have cash. 
</P>
<P>
"This would be $2,500 new," Bernard said of a gold pinkie ring sporting a 
3/4-carat diamond. "Here, it's $1,600. And, if a customer had cash, they could 
walk out of the store with this ring for $1,200 or $1,300." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry, the manager of Royal Loan Pawnbrokers, says he has had customers this 
year who charged expensive items on their department store accounts in order to 
sell them to Jerry for cash. That's how he got the new video camera in the 
window -- just $895, complete with manufacturer's warranty. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry doesn't want to see his last name in the newspaper; he says he wants his 
customers to visit him at the 4,000-square-foot store, not at home. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry, who calls his shop the poor man's bank, likes to hand out a three-color 
flyer that commands: "Visit Your Pawn Shop for a Day of Exciting Shopping." It 
points out the relative impossibility of getting a 30-to-90 day loan of, say, 
$300 from a larger financial institution. It also notes that pawnshops are 
legitimate businesses, licensed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
"You may be asking, 'Isn't a lot of the merchandise in a pawnshop stolen?' " 
reads the flyer, which uses the term "previously owned merchandise" instead of 
"used." The answer is no, it says. "The pawn broker is not here today and gone 
tomorrow like the flea market, auction sale, garage sale, or the guy selling 
out of a van on the side of the road." 
</P>
<P>
On the wall at Royal Loan is a vibrant painting by LeRoy Neiman, the artist 
best known for his sports paintings and his close association with Playboy 
publisher Hugh Hefner. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be $10,000 at any gallery in La Jolla," Jerry says. "We're asking 
$5,500." 
</P>
<P>
At the loan counter is a photograph of a Classic '58 Buick with a custom 
turquoise paint job and all the original parts. Somebody pawned the car and 
never picked it up. It has just 3,700 miles on it, and it can by yours for 
"just $4,995, or best offer." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry claims to have no set limit on his loans. But he doesn't take just 
anything as collateral, as one woman found out Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's before Christmas, and I'm running low, and I found out my boyfriend's got 
me an engagement ring," she said, holding out a slim wristwatch. "I want to get 
him something special. If you could give me even $10 for this. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry shook his head. Only gold watches and Rolexes, he explained. "I'm sorry," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Another woman was on the telephone. She needed a minimum of $1,000, she said, 
for an Australian coin. 
</P>
<P>
"You got gold coins?" Jerry asked her. "Bring 'em all in here and I'll do my 
best to see you walk out of here with $1,000."

THE FOLKS WHO BRING YOU CHRISTMAS . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's finally Christmas morning, and another hectic holiday season is almost 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Santa has come and gone, and most of the colorful wrappings are torn from 
packages that were under the brightly decorated tree. The stockings that were 
hung by the chimney with care lie discarded on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Preparations for Christmas dinner are under way, and the smell of roasting 
turkey wafts from many a kitchen. Thoughts turn to family and friends who will 
gather later. 
</P>
<P>
All but forgotten are the crowded parking lots, the long lines and the rest of 
the nerve-racking hustle-bustle that goes with the season. 
</P>
<P>
Also far from most of our minds are the people who helped bring us Christmas -- 
the store clerk who painstakingly helped select that special tie or cologne, 
the delivery man who banged on your door each time a package arrived, the nice 
woman who hand-packed a box of candy and waited patiently as you made your 
selections. 
</P>
<P>
Most who provide services to people during the holidays have worked long hours 
and have had little time for Christmas preparations for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I have one day off before Christmas, and I haven't even bought one gift," said 
a harried clerk in a women's clothing store last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been open until 11 every night. I didn't want to work this much." 
</P>
<P>
Following are a few examples of people who made Christmas a little brighter for 
others this year. Their stories were compiled by Times staff writers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The candy merchant: Doris Dennis has been custom-packing sweet dreams for 
nearly 50 years. 'I can pretty much tell what people will order,' she says. 
</P>
<P>
There's chaos in the candy shop. The line of customers is 32 people long, 
snaking its way to the cash register. People with their arms akimbo look like 
human Christmas trees, decorated with brightly wrapped boxes of prepackaged 
chocolates -- in 1-, 2- and 3-pound assortments -- tucked under their limbs. 
</P>
<P>
But step behind the counter at See's Candies Quantity Order Store No. 2106 in 
Reseda, and into the domain of Doris Dennis, and it's a different world. 
Dennis, who first worked for See's almost 50 years ago, and the other women in 
white pack each box by hand. None of that ready-made stuff over here. This is 
where you point out one of these and two of those until you have a whole box 
filled with just the right amount of Mint Krispys, Bordeaux, Tipperary Bonbons, 
Divinity Puffs and California Crunch. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the angled glass display cases with their rows of footed candy dishes 
and doilied platters, it is organized. Dennis knows the layout by heart. On the 
right, you have your milks, or milk chocolates. On the far left, you have your 
darks. And in between sit the truffles, all 11 varieties, your summer softs, 
and the nuts and chews. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis, 70, is an intermittent employee who has managed two stores in a career 
with See's that started in 1941. Now, she works the holidays only and won't be 
back until Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
"I can pretty much tell what people will order," she said last week. "The 
Europeans like marzipan and ginger, the Southerners like the pecan rolls and 
pecan buds, and Americans, they like milk chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
"I venture to say I've tried every one," Dennis said, including a new item: 
Peanut Butter Patties. "It's nice when we get a new one in. They never had 
peanut centers. I think someone in the family didn't care for peanuts." 
</P>
<P>
With her white hair and black-rimmed glasses, Dennis resembles Mary See, whose 
portrait watches over daily transactions from behind the counter. Dennis glides 
back and forth from the stockroom to the counter, pausing to wrap a gift or 
pull 30 striped red sugar sticks from a drawerful of multicolored candies. 
</P>
<P>
She's told her doctor that she gets all the exercise she needs at work. "I love 
the activity. For eight full hours, you're going steady. The doctor says this 
kind of walking doesn't do you any good," she said with a smile. "What do you 
think?" IRIS SCHNEIDER

MISSING DIVER SAFE AFTER 27 HOURS AT SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER PUMMER and GERRY BRAILO SPENCER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter T. Megis Jr. tossed about in eight-foot ocean swells, watching Navy and 
Coast Guard helicopters vainly searching for him for nearly six hours Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the choppers flew within 100 yards of him, Megis said Monday, but 
their pilots were unable to spot his wet suit in the turbulent seas four miles 
from Channel Islands Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard, after looking for Megis all Sunday afternoon, called off the 
search and did not resume it Monday. 
</P>
<P>
After spending nearly 27 hours riding currents that took him from Ventura 
Harbor to Point Mugu, Megis on Monday pulled himself onto oil platform Gilda, 
10 miles off the coast of Port Hueneme, and declared himself to be quite alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm well and kicking, not even in a hospital," Megis said, remarkably unfazed 
by the ordeal. "I had a lot of fun. I'm serious." 
</P>
<P>
"We sure were surprised to see him," said a rig worker who asked not to be 
identified. "He was fine. We have an emergency medical technician on duty 24 
hours a day, so we set him up with warm clothing, took his blood pressure and 
temperature and gave him food and drink." 
</P>
<P>
Megis, a 27-year-old Navy petty officer who lives in Oxnard, was feared to be 
dead after he failed to surface while scuba diving Sunday to spearfish and 
explore a shipwreck in 80 feet of water. He had dived off a 26-foot pleasure 
boat, and his companion sent out a distress signal when Megis failed to surface 
after an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Megis said that when he surfaced from his dive, he found himself about 50 yards 
from his friend's boat and unable to be heard over the noise of the sea. A 
severe riptide then swept him a quarter of a mile from the boat. 
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard helicopter and two cutters were joined by a helicopter from the 
Point Mugu naval station. "They were always within a hundred yards to two miles 
of me," Megis said. "All my equipment's black, so I didn't show up too well in 
8-to-10-foot seas." 
</P>
<P>
Toward nightfall, the seas kicked up to 12 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Megis said he was not concerned, even after sunset. "I could always swim back 
to the beach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Megis said he just floated with the currents toward the island, but the 
riptides were too strong for him. "They were running parallel to the island. I 
couldn't get through them, even though it was a couple hundred yards." 
</P>
<P>
About 11 p.m. Sunday, after 12 hours in the water, Megis went to sleep, kept 
afloat by his wet suit and scuba gear. "I was never lost at sea," he said, to 
explain his ability to sleep. "You can't be lost if you can see the land 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
"Every two hours I'd wake up and swim real hard so I would warm up a bit and 
not freeze to death," Megis said. Water temperatures were about 60 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Megis awoke Monday morning when the sun rose, finding that he had floated 
closer to Point Mugu. He was within a few miles of the oil rigs, made a shot 
for two of them but was repelled by the currents. He succeeded in reaching the 
third after a six-hour swim.

It's finally Christmas morning, and another hectic holiday season is almost 
over. 
</P>

a harried clerk in a women's clothing store last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been open until 11 every night. I didn't want to work this much." 
</P>
<P>
Following are a few examples of people who made Christmas a little brighter for 
others this year. Their stories were compiled by Times staff writers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The tree seller: A landscaper braves cold and tedium to help his patrons find 
the perfect holiday conifer. 
</P>
<P>
For most of the year, J.R. Wallworth does landscaping jobs at residences from 
Thousand Oaks to Beverly Hills. But during the holiday season, he camps out at 
the corner of Sepulveda Boulevard and Valerio Street in Van Nuys as manager of 
a Christmas tree lot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like a little vacation," said Wallworth, who has been working at 
the lot owned by his employer, Oliver Holt &amp; Sons, for 10 years. "It's nice 
to sit out at night in front of a campfire. I never thought I'd be sitting out 
on Sepulveda Boulevard in front of a fire." 
</P>
<P>
The greatest problem each year, Wallworth said, is fighting the boredom that 
comes in the inevitable lull between waves of customers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's not too much to amuse yourself," he said. He and his co-workers pass 
the time by playing baseball and Frisbee. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, bonds have formed between them, and many workers return to sell 
trees at this lot. Five of Wallworth's employees are with him for the eighth 
Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
Wallworth has sold more than 1,000 trees since he opened the lot Dec. 1, and he 
expected to sell at least 500 more by today. 
</P>
<P>
The work has been hard this year, and signs of strain were beginning to show 
last week. Wallworth said he has been putting in 14- to 15-hour days, and much 
of it has been spent working outside in unusually cold temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
As Christmas got closer, many customers were impatient, and others were hoping 
for a last-minute bargain. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though they're buying Christmas trees, they're not necessarily in the 
Christmas spirit, and they don't like to be kept waiting," he said. "By the end 
of the season, it's hard to keep the Christmas spirit. When you're dealing with 
customers who are just trying to get a cheap tree, it's tough." 
</P>
<P>
And sometimes, customers don't plan ahead. For example, they don't come 
prepared to transport that especially large tree home. "They buy like two 
seven-foot trees, and they've got a VW outside. That's the worst," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the pleasures of the job far outweigh the irritations, Wallworth said. One

MENTAL-HEALTH RIGHTS MOVEMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
Isaac blames the catastrophe of homelessness among mentally ill people on the 
counterculture and the New Left of the '60s. She is furious that mentally ill 
people have some rights, such as the right to due process before being 
subjected to hospitalization or forced to take very strong and potentially 
dangerous drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence is overwhelming that when mentally ill people are offered 
intensive, comprehensive but voluntary programs that allow them some dignity as 
people, the vast majority participate. 
</P>
<P>
Homelessness is tragic for a mentally ill person. But we will be deluding 
ourselves if we follow Isaac's advice and believe we can solve the problem not 
by providing housing, support and treatment but by taking away people's rights.

PALOS VERDES 'DREAM HOUSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apparently the crux of the homeowner association's position hinges on its bylaw 
that requires anyone building a home in the city to "proceed diligently." 
</P>
<P>
The word proceed means "to go forward," and the word diligent means 
"painstaking, with careful attention to detail." There is no link between the 
phrase "proceed diligently" and time. 
</P>
<P>
The Aughinbaughs could theoretically continue building for another 30 years and 
still be said to be proceeding diligently.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: POLICE ARREST 3 OVER RESEDA MAN'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 26-year-old computer programmer and two unemployed tow-truck drivers were 
arrested on suspicion of murder after another man was stabbed to death 
following a quarrel in Reseda, Los Angeles police reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Andreas Sotiropoulos Jr., 22, died of his injuries at Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Police arrested William Scott Manciano, a computer programmer, on Sunday night 
after they found him hiding under a car behind a restaurant in the 19600 block 
of Sherman Way, Lt. Richard Pooler said. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Arellano, 25, and Martin Thomas Burns, 21, were arrested Monday at their 
residence in Reseda. Police described the men as unemployed tow-truck drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Sotiropoulos had recently moved to Reseda from Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Pooler said the stabbing occurred in the 7200 block of Corbin Avenue after the 
victim was confronted by Manciano and several other men. The victim staggered 
into the restaurant looking for help after the stabbing and was taken to 
Northridge Hospital Medical Center, where he died, Pooler said. 
</P>
<P>
Pooler said he did not know the reason for the fight.

LAST CHANCE U 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re: your story on Last Chance U (Metro, Dec. 13), the plight of these children 
is a consequence of the interaction of an impoverished emotional status, which 
is frequently accompanied by an impoverished economic status, subculture mores 
that accept violence as a way of settling problems, tolerance of crime as a 
profession, a cultural habit of wasting resources, including human beings, the 
use of drugs to escape from our problems and ourselves, and an educational 
system that has yet to adapt to the realities of our diverse society. The steps 
being taken to help these children is typical of our throw-away society: create 
a problem, allow the problem to develop and spread, then institute half-way 
measures to address one aspect of that problem -- in this case, failure in the 
regular classroom. 
</P>
<P>
We must recognize the intrinsic value of every human being, of their status in 
society, that the child belongs to society, not to the parent, that all human 
beings have a right to a style of life that recognizes their humanity, and 
return to the tribal concept of a reciprocal responsibility between society and 
the individual, for the good of all.

MENTAL-HEALTH RIGHTS MOVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In her article on the de-institutionalization of the mentally ill, (Commentary, 
Dec. 15) Rael Jean Isaac appears to be curiously uninformed about the 
mental-health rights movement in the United States. Either that or she has set 
up a straw man in the form of R.D. Laing in order to avoid dealing with the 
real issues in mental health, which is, of course, money. 
</P>
<P>
As someone who was involved in the mental-health rights movement of the early 
1970s and who knows many of the far more active and important participants, I 
can say that Isaac has totally missed all the key points of that movement. Some 
activists, of course, were influenced by Laing. For most of us, however, the 
issues were quite different. 
</P>
<P>
There were really three key issues. One was the abominable condition of 
mental-health facilities around the country. Many facilities had no 
professional staff caring for the patients and provided no treatment except for 
the joke called milieu therapy. The physical structures housing the mentally 
ill and retarded were ancient and dilapidated, the food inadequate, 
recreational space close to nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
The second key issue involved who was committed and how. Procedures for 
commitment were so loose that people could be and were committed who met no 
one's definition of insanity. Courts and legislatures were willing to deal with 
procedural issues but not willing in many instances to do anything about the 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, in bringing this litigation it was not anyone's expectation that 
the mentally ill would roam the Skid Rows of this country, uncared for. For one 
thing, it now turns out that advocates for the mentally ill had unreasonable 
expectations about the ability of the various psychotropic drugs to help people 
lead more mainstream lives. In many cases, these drugs produce side effects 
worse than any condition they might cure. This, of course, has given rise to 
the third key issue, the right to refuse often dangerous treatment. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, advocates for the mentally ill believed, at least for a while 
that as patients were de-institutionalized, the states, with federal help, 
would develop a network of community mental-health centers that would assist 
and support the former patients in becoming part of the community. However, 
this network was only partially developed and in the '80s allowed to 
disintegrate. Most former patients have never received the support they would 
need to move off Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
The real problem is that a good mental-health system costs substantially more 
money than government is willing to put into it. But we are no longer a society 
that wants to resolve social problems, if it involves doing more than throwing 
people into a horrendously under-funded criminal justice system.

PALOS VERDES 'DREAM HOUSE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was appalled upon reading the article (Page One, Dec. 15.) regarding the 
Aughinbaughs' Palos Verdes home. Apparently the homeowners' association has 
given itself the authority as lord and master over all the residents. 
</P>
<P>
They have put the Aughinbaughs through hell -- and for what? The association 
doesn't want to gaze upon something that might not be pleasing to their eyes; 
they want their community to be perfect (who cares if the people in these homes 
have lost all compassion and love for their fellow man). These people would 
rather have a bare, razed lot than have to spend one more horrible day watching 
that beautiful (nearly completed) home be finished. 
</P>
<P>
The court in this case has one question to ask itself: What is best for the 
neighborhood? Allowing the completion of a home in which the Aughinbaughs have 
spent more than a million dollars, not to mention the hard work and love 
they've put into it over the years. The home will be a handsome addition to the 
area, adding beauty and thereby raising surrounding home values. The ugly 
alternative, tearing it down leaving a bare piece of dirt, seems somehow 
unholy, and definitely criminal.

BLAME SAUDI RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY, NOT ISLAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIREEN T. HUNTER, Shireen T. Hunter is a deputy director of the Middle East 
project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. and other Western forces deployed in Saudi Arabia, in vast array, in major 
part to defend the kingdom, have been under strict instructions not to display 
any sign of their religions because, the Saudis assert, this would be an 
affront to Islam. That is simply untrue. 
</P>
<P>
Intolerance of other religions reflects Saudi custom, not Islamic practice. The 
Wahabi sect, which is dominant in Saudi Arabia, even considers many non-Wahabi 
Muslims to be infidels. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the teachings of Islam provide specifically for the other so-called 
Peoples of the Book -- meaning the Jews and the Christians -- to whom God has 
revealed himself through his messengers and the holy books, the Old and New 
Testaments. By injunction, all these peoples are to be given the protection of 
the Islamic community. Within certain rules and regulations, Jews and 
Christians living in Muslim lands are free to practice their faith without 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
The Prophet Mohammed made a point of saying that he did not come to eliminate 
the other monotheist religions but rather to complement them. The Koran accepts 
and venerates all of the Old Testament prophets, and it holds in special esteem 
both Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary, calling her "the spiritually most 
beautiful person in this world and in the hereafter." 
</P>
<P>
Clear testament to this tradition can be found in the existence of Christian 
and Jewish communities, with their places of worship, throughout Muslim lands. 
No doubt, not all Muslim governments have always been as observant of the 
rights of their non-Muslim peoples as the Koran prescribes. But that fact does 
not lessen the validity of those rights. 
</P>
<P>
Recent tensions between many Muslims and many Christians and Jews have stemmed 
not from the nature and character of any of the religions but from the politics 
of the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
It is important for the future of U.S.-Muslim relations that these facts become 
known and that Saudi customs should not be equated with Islamic rules. But it 
is more than simple politics. 
</P>
<P>
At this time when Christians and Jews are celebrating important festivals, 
while many of them are serving in the armed forces in the Persian Gulf, 
religious tolerance and understanding is critical. Otherwise, the current 
crisis could drive apart peoples who otherwise have a common purpose in 
combating aggression, instead of bringing them closer together in pursuit of a 
moral purpose that, as People of the Book, they all share.

THE FOLKS WHO BRING YOU CHRISTMAS . . .

<TEXT>
<P>
It's finally Christmas morning, and another hectic holiday season is almost 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Santa has come and gone, and most of the colorful wrappings are torn from 
packages that were under the brightly decorated tree. The stockings that were 
hung by the chimney with care lie discarded on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Preparations for Christmas dinner are under way, and the smell of roasting 
turkey wafts from many a kitchen. Thoughts turn to family and friends who will 
gather later. 
</P>
<P>
All but forgotten are the crowded parking lots, the long lines and the rest of 
the nerve-racking hustle-bustle that goes with the season. 
</P>
<P>
Also far from most of our minds are the people who helped bring us Christmas -- 
the store clerk who painstakingly helped select that special tie or cologne, 
the delivery man who banged on your door each time a package arrived, the nice 
woman who hand-packed a box of candy and waited patiently as you made your 
selections. 
</P>
<P>
Most who provide services to people during the holidays have worked long hours 
and have had little time for Christmas preparations for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I have one day off before Christmas, and I haven't even bought one gift," said 
a harried clerk in a women's clothing store last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been open until 11 every night. I didn't want to work this much." 
</P>
<P>
Following are a few examples of people who made Christmas a little brighter for 
others this year. Their stories were compiled by Times staff writers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The mounted officer: Patrolling on horseback brings Jim Render a dose of 
holiday spirit while keeping a tight rein on crime in a crowded mall parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Render feels almost as popular as Santa Claus around the shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
Render, 29, is a Los Angeles mounted police officer assigned during the holiday 
season to the parking lots at three of the largest malls in the San Fernando 
Valley. The unit's officers and horses are almost as visible outside the malls 
as the fat man in the red suit is noticeable inside. Children flock to them, 
and adults are comforted by their presence when taking their holiday gifts to 
their cars. 
</P>
<P>
And Render and his cohorts, who wear spurs and cowboy boots and hats, like it 
that way. In fact, helping to safeguard Christmas for others, Render says, 
makes his own holiday all the better. 
</P>
<P>
"This enhances Christmas for me. It gets me in the spirit," Render said while 
on patrol last week at Northridge Fashion Center on his horse, Tulsa. "I see a 
lot of young, happy children, and it rubs off. . . . It's a break from dealing 
with the bad guys." 
</P>
<P>
Although he lives alone now, Render said that seeing the happy children at the 
malls reminds him of past Christmases spent with his close-knit family in 
Carson. 
</P>
<P>
The three-officer patrols also watch over harried Christmas shoppers at Valley 
Plaza in North Hollywood and Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the mounted patrols give them the advantage of being able to see 
far across sprawling and packed parking lots. The patrols are believed to be a 
deterrent against car break-ins, purse snatchings and other parking lot crimes 
that often rise when malls become crowded during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
Render, who is tall and well-built, served in a narcotics unit and in patrol 
squads in some of the city's gang-infested neighborhoods before moving to the 
mounted unit last Christmas. He said being on the horse beat during the 
holidays has been one of his most rewarding police assignments. 
</P>
<P>
"You are dealing with people that are happy to see you. They let their guard 
down with you and talk to you. It keeps me in touch with reality -- the reality 
that not everybody out there is a bad guy." MICHAEL CONNELLY

<P>
The gift wrapper: Esther Loveman makes pretty packages with holiday cheer. 
</P>
<P>
Esther Loveman will wrap almost anything. 
</P>
<P>
Loveman, who has been wrapping gifts at The Broadway in Northridge for more 
than 14 years, said wrapping tables is about the hardest, and once she had to 
do a big chest with drawers. But even she has her limits. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't do refrigerators," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who is quick with a smile and loves to laugh, Loveman works at a long 
counter, with ribbons and 12 different kinds of colorful Christmas paper within 
reach. She is the senior member of the Northridge Broadway gift-wrapping team. 
</P>
<P>
She estimates that during the Christmas season she wraps between 150 and 200 
presents each day. While that kind of pace is hectic, Loveman said she has a 
good time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fun job, because we have a great group of people here," she said, 
gesturing to the several women busily wrapping and tying bows alongside her. 
"We have a radio on. We talk a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the harried condition of most of her customers, Loveman said most of 
them are in a good mood. "Once in a while, you get a cranky person, but not too 
often," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Loveman said there is a definite technique to wrapping a present. "There's a 
certain way of doing these things," she said, as she snipped a piece of ribbon 
with a pair of scissors. 
</P>
<P>
She said she learned her technique through experience but likes to kid people 
who ask her about it. She recalled with a chuckle some people who "wanted to 
know where I learned my skills. And I said, 'The UCLA School of Gift Wrapping.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Although this season has been hectic, that hasn't dampened Loveman's 
enthusiasm. "I get tired, but not tired of this," she said. "I love it. That's 
my last name, I love it!" 
</P>
<P>
But her family shouldn't expect presents wrapped in the brightly colored paper 
and festive bows that Loveman spends so many hours doing at work. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't wrap Christmas presents," she said, laughing. "I give it to them in 
the boxes." JOHN RIVERA

THE FOLKS WHO BRING YOU CHRISTMAS . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN RIVERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's finally Christmas morning, and another hectic holiday season is almost 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Santa has come and gone, and most of the colorful wrappings are torn from 
packages that were under the brightly decorated tree. The stockings that were 
hung by the chimney with care lie discarded on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Preparations for Christmas dinner are under way, and the smell of roasting 
turkey wafts from many a kitchen. Thoughts turn to family and friends who will 
gather later. 
</P>
<P>
All but forgotten are the crowded parking lots, the long lines and the rest of 
the nerve-racking hustle-bustle that goes with the season. 
</P>
<P>
Also far from most of our minds are the people who helped bring us Christmas -- 
the store clerk who painstakingly helped select that special tie or cologne, 
the delivery man who banged on your door each time a package arrived, the nice 
woman who hand-packed a box of candy and waited patiently as you made your 
selections. 
</P>
<P>
Most who provide services to people during the holidays have worked long hours 
and have had little time for Christmas preparations for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I have one day off before Christmas, and I haven't even bought one gift," said 
a harried clerk in a women's clothing store last week. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been open until 11 every night. I didn't want to work this much." 
</P>
<P>
Following are a few examples of people who made Christmas a little brighter for 
others this year. Their stories were compiled by Times staff writers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The cosmetics clerk: Mary DiBlasi guides devoted customers through the daunting 
task of selecting just the right fragrance. 
</P>
<P>
When Mary DiBlasi is helping someone with a holiday perfume or cosmetic 
purchase, she isn't just cutting a deal, she's forming a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very strong on customer service," she said. "A lot of people are 
intimidated when they come to a cosmetics counter." 
</P>
<P>
DiBlasi has been serving many of her customers since she started at the 
cosmetics counter of May Company in the Sherman Oaks Galleria more than 10 
years ago. When they need perfume or makeup, not just any salesperson will do. 
</P>
<P>
"I have customers who won't come in here unless they call in first and know I'm 
here," she said. "Because I take care of them." 
</P>
<P>
DiBlasi, who started working shortly after her husband died, said the job has 
been a saving grace. "It's been a therapy for me," she said. "I enjoy my job, 
and I love people, and I love my customers, and they all bring me presents." 
</P>
<P>
This year, one of her faithful customers took her out to dinner and gave her a 
bottle of champagne as a Christmas present. When she recently was in the 
hospital for surgery, cards and flowers came flooding in from customers. And 
while she was out of work, the store couldn't sell anything in her line of 
perfume. Her customers instead waited for DiBlasi to return. 
</P>
<P>
"You become friends," she said. "That's the kind of customers I have." 
</P>
<P>
This holiday season has given her the opportunity to make many more friends. 
Although the season started slowly, business picked up two weekends before 
Christmas. On one weeknight, during a five-hour period, DiBlasi sold $2,500 
worth of perfume and cosmetics. "That's a lot of selling, that's a lot of 
money," she said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, people seem to be buying but are holding back and spending a little 
less, she said. "The only thing is that people, instead of spending $200 or 
$300, only spend $100 on a fragrance." 
</P>
<P>
DiBlasi estimated that about 60% of her customers this holiday season have been 
men, and she said they are by far the easier to please. 
</P>
<P>
"Women watch their pennies more," she said, and will often ask for something 
less expensive when they hear the price. With her male customers, however, "the 
first thing you show them, they take it." JOHN RIVERA

REGIONAL EARNINGS: MATTHEWS STUDIO EQUIPMENT POSTS PROFIT OF $456,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Matthews Studio Equipment Group in Burbank said its fiscal 1990 profit more 
than tripled from the previous year, to $456,000 from $138,000. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews, a provider of equipment and services to the film and television 
industries, said the higher earnings came on a 36% jump in revenue, to $20 
million in the year ended Sept. 30 from $14.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company said most of the profit gain stemmed from the expansion of its 
Hollywood Rental Co. unit, which rents production equipment to the studios.

<TEXT>
<P>
Players International Inc. in Calabasas, through a subsidiary, has entered into 
a joint venture with a Miami company to offer its call-in versions of 
"Jeopardy!" and "Wheel of Fortune" to pay-phone customers and hotel guests.

the phone-in games. 
</P>
<P>
The program is being offered under a joint venture between Players and Peoples 
Telephone Inc. of Miami, an operator of pay telephones.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: SYNCOR REPORTS SLIGHTLY HIGHER 2ND-QUARTER PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Syncor International Corp., a Chatsworth operator of pharmacy centers that 
primarily serve health-care facilities and doctors, said its fiscal 
second-quarter profit edged up to $1.03 million from $1 million a year earlier, 
when its earnings included a $216,000 tax-related gain. 
</P>
<P>
The latest profit in the quarter that ended Nov. 30 came on a 19% increase in 
Syncor's sales, to $37.3 million from $31.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of its fiscal year, Syncor earned $2.10 million, down 
slightly from $2.15 million a year earlier, when Syncor's net income included a 
$548,000 tax gain. Excluding the extraordinary gain, Syncor's profit was up 31% 
from a year ago. Its six-month sales rose 19% to $73.4 million from $61.8 
million.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: CALIFORNIA AMPLIFIER INC. REPORTS LOSS OF $536,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Amplifier Inc., a Camarillo-based maker of home satellite dishes and 
other telecommunications products, reported a $536,000 loss for its fiscal 
third quarter, compared to a $228,000 profit a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The loss stemmed mainly from a $700,000 charge related to California 
Amplifier's decision to abandon the defense side of its industry and focus on 
commercial sales. The loss also came despite a 22% increase in the company's 
sales in the quarter ended Dec. 1, to $3.78 million from $3.09 million. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of its fiscal year, California Amplifier lost 
$370,000, compared to a $183,000 profit a year earlier, and its nine-month 
sales rose 31% to $11 million from $8.38 million.

JAPANESE INTRODUCE LATEST BATCH OF GADGETS; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: PRODUCTS RANGE FROM CLOTHES THAT CHANGE COLOR WITH THE TEMPERATURE 
TO FABRIC THAT KILLS TICKS AND A CURE FOR COMPUTER 'VIRUSES.'

<P>
This year's holiday season will make a few thousand Japanese some of the first 
people in the world to unwrap gifts that will cure a computer virus, warn of 
exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays and kill ticks. 
</P>
<P>
These are some of the futuristic, innovative -- and, in some cases, just plain 
gimmicky -- new products Japanese companies fed into their domestic market this 
fall with the approach of the annual year-end season for giving "gratitude" 
gifts to bosses, teachers, social superiors and people who have in some way 
helped the givers get through the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
If they sell here this year, some of them to go into export catalogues in a 
year or two. Others will go through a few refinements, or be abandoned, as 
Japanese manufacturers go over the test-market results. 
</P>
<P>
This year's new entries are the first appearances on the market of goods that 
typically have taken five years to go from design to market testing. 
</P>
<P>
At that pace, product-design reports in Japanese trade publications suggest, 
five years from now a few Japanese can expect to be offered new houses in which 
they can telephone their bathrooms to dial in the depth and temperature of 
bathwater, the lighting level and the scenery -- African jungle, for example, 
or Alpine snow, displayed on a panoramic wall unit -- that they want to find 
waiting when they get home. 
</P>
<P>
By 1997, Business Tokyo Today magazine predicted last month, three-dimensional 
television sets and home video telephones will be on the market in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Misawa Homes Co., a major builder that has pioneered many facets of 
computerized architecture, said last year that it was at work on a robotized 
bedroom that would encapsulate a sleeper in an isolated atmosphere, free of 
street noises and neighbors' cooking odors, and lull him to sleep with oxygen 
and relaxing music. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the new products introduced this fall were scheduled at the peak of the 
go-go 1980s, but the breakneck pace at which Japan's giant companies have 
brought them to the market does little to reflect the slowing pace at which 
even this country's dynamic economy grew in this first year of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many new gadgets and machines now that consumers find it hard 
even to keep abreast of what's on the market, much less to decide what to buy," 
Tokyo Business Today said as the fall entries began to pile up on shelves. 
</P>
<P>
The trend toward "fuzzy logic" microcomputers to control machines and 
appliances, which began in earnest in 1989, became the dominant theme of 
electrical products in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
They include a "fully fuzzy" washing machine that can sense what kind of 
materials are being laundered, adjust the water temperature and level, set the 
time and speed of the cycle and, if so instructed, raise the water temperature 
to 122 degrees long enough to kill ticks. 
</P>
<P>
Offered by Sharp, the machine sells for $700 in its small Japanese-sized model, 
roughly equivalent to an apartment-size washer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
For those who prefer to kill their ticks chemically, Tokyo Style Co. came out 
this year with an encapsulated fabric that gives off gases to do away with the 
insects. 
</P>
<P>
The number of items with tick-killing options was one of the striking features 
of this year's new-products season, one evidence of changes prosperity has 
brought. 
</P>
<P>
As the nation has moved from leaky wooden houses to more airtight, centrally 
heated apartments, it has been plagued increasingly by the tiny, burrowing 
insects, and marketing studies have shown an increasing receptiveness to goods 
that will help cope with them. 
</P>
<P>
The tick-killing cloth was just one of several experiments in marketing 
encapsulated fibers, which permit a variety of chemical applications that 
respond to environmental signals such as light and temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Kanebo, a cosmetics company, opened that field in 1987 with pantyhose that give 
off perfume in response to leg movements, a market that is expected to reach 
$38 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
More practical uses began last year with ski wear that is white to reflect heat 
at temperatures above 41 and moves through darkening shades of gray to become 
black -- and absorb heat -- at 32. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Tokyo Style applied the same idea to golf, adding color by making 
clothing that is white above 82 degrees, shading off into a deep wine, red or 
green below 57. 
</P>
<P>
The "vaccine" for a computer virus came from Konica, which began to market a 
program disk designed to kill the "Christmas Virus," which has delayed start-up 
operations for thousands of personal computer users by flashing the words 
"Merry Christmas to You" on display screens for several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Konica said the new disk is the first in a line of computer vaccines it 
proposes to bring out in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Prominent this year in the expanding ultraviolet-warning field, which has 
attracted new offerings for three straight years as consumers become more aware 
of the dangers of exposure to the sun, was an $80 watch from Toray Industries 
that measures radiation levels and calculates exposure over time. 
</P>
<P>
It was one among hundreds of new entries catering to growing health and 
environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
In the country that introduced, in 1988, the toilet that gives a digital 
display of blood-sugar level as a person urinates -- and blood pressure and 
pulse rate at the same time when a finger is placed in a small socket -- it 
became possible this year to buy an umbrella designed to shut out ultraviolet 
light and to buy an ever-expanding range of health drinks that claim to do 
everything from easing arthritic pain to improving performance at sports and 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
Sun-Star Stationers offers a $39 kit that enables the buyer to boil torn-up 
newspapers and cardboard cartons with a soap powder and an ink eradicator, pour 
the product into a wooden frame and produce postcard-sized recycled writing 
paper.

IS IT JUST MUZAK OR MUSICAL MIND CONTROL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If the purpose of Muzak ("Humming Right Along," Dec. 19) is to "reduce stress 
and increase job efficiency," then why do I feel like killing somebody after 
being exposed to it for a few minutes? 
</P>
<P>
Face it. The whole idea behind Muzak is nothing but thought control. It's a 
wonder that Hitler or Stalin never thought of it. 
</P>
<P>
As for me, I would just as soon hear the ear-shattering garble from some 
idiot's boom box.

SOLUTIONS TO A CHRISTMAS DILEMMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christians (and others) who celebrate Christmas do not do so with the thought 
of imposing upon non-believers. It is a religious season of joy for Christians. 
</P>
<P>
The cant of the language employed by your correspondent indicated a general 
sympathy for those who felt put upon. The idea endorsed by your newspaper seems 
to be that Christians, by celebrating one of their principal feasts, are 
downright mean to those who are of a different religion or no religion. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose this is yet another one of the children of diversity and 
"multiculturalism." 
</P>
<P>
Well, fine. It seems to me that if you actually share this idea you are morally 
obligated not to accept any commercial advertising for the Christmas season.

The answer to "What can non-Christian children do?" is enjoy the festival and 
join in the fun. 
</P>
<P>
We enjoyed all cultural festivals held in the streets of New York. The same 
enjoyment should apply in the schools. The Oktoberfest, Chinese New Year, Mardi 
Gras, Italian, Greek, Irish, etc., all festivals should be respected, preserved 
and enjoyed in America. People spend thousands of dollars and time their 
vacations to coincide with foreign festivals. We are lucky, we have them in our 
own back yard.

POLEMICAL HORRORS OF THE NUCLEAR WINTER; 
</P>
<P>
A PATH WHERE NO MAN THOUGHT: NUCLEAR WINTER AND THE END OF THE ARMS RACE, BY 
CARL SAGAN AND RICHARD TURCO. RANDOM HOUSE INC. $18.95, CLOTH; 320 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. SCHULL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: Schull was a member of the Atomic 
Bomb Casualty Commission that visited Japan after World War II to study the 
genetic effects of radiation on A-bomb victims. His most recent book is Song 
Among the Ruins (Harvard). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While some officials in the Reagan Administration predicted that Americans 
could survive a nuclear war "with enough shovels" to dig for cover, the picture 
presented by many working scientists is far darker. In this provocative study 
of the dangers of nuclear proliferation, astrophysicists Carl Sagan and Richard 
Turco argue that smoke clouds will occlude the sun's warming effects after a 
full-scale nuclear war, bringing the bone-wracking chill and darkness of an 
arctic winter. 
</P>
<P>
The image, to be sure, is emotionally jarring, but it might not be entirely 
true. Scientists unrepresented in these sometimes polemical pages have argued 
that the evidence gathered so far -- from volcanic eruptions at Mt. St. Helens 
to forest fires in Yellowstone -- does not support the most dire predictions. 
</P>
<P>
Some scientists differ only on the degree of destruction, not disputing the 
inevitability of a catastrophe. Other differences are more fundamentally 
scientific, dealing, for example, with the validity of the convection current 
modeling the authors use to predict effects from the area immediately adjacent 
to the Earth -- the troposphere -- up to the stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, neither the authors nor their critics can muster 
arguments that are based on more than the imperfect art of computer modeling, 
whose failures at predicting weather are well-known to those who live in 
volatile regions such as the tropical storm belt. 
</P>
<P>
Still, we cannot afford to wager if the horrendous consequences of nuclear 
winter are even remotely possible. A miscalculation could precipitate enormous 
climatic and environmental changes and ultimately kill a substantial fraction 
of humankind as well as the worsen of the quality of life for the minority who 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
While not always persuasive as scientists, Sagan and Turco are effective 
politicians, revealing some of the duplicity that has surrounded the politics 
of nuclear deterrence and the senselessness of the belief that a strategy which 
threatens all of us nonetheless protects some of us. Also well-reasoned is 
their call for a nuclear strategy based on the principle of minimum sufficient 
deterrence. 
</P>
<P>
Publication of "Path Where No Man Thought" is particularly timely in view of 
the brinkmanship in the Middle East into which we have been thrust. As we 
possibly edge toward war, can there be a more pertinent or greater 
recommendation to ponder carefully these authors' arguments, lest we stumble 
into a situation no thoughtful person would wish? Surely an aroused public is 
the greatest deterrent to a nuclear winter, and this book will help inform 
their discretion.

Dude of the Year: He's bug-eyed, missing two fingers and has no chin, but Bart 
J. Simpson has what it takes to capture Entertainment Weekly's 
entertainer-of-the-year title. 
</P>
<P>
The folk anti-hero who was a virtual unknown just one year ago became an 
underachiever for the ages in 1990. He's got his own TV show, a record album 
and a "Do the Bartman" rock video. Entertainment Weekly said Bart also deserves 
credit for not catching typical Hollywood afflictions: He didn't punch out any 
paparazzi, make a trip to the Betty Ford Center or sing the National Anthem. 
Runners-up for the award included Julia Roberts, Madonna, Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, M.C. Hammer and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. BETH KLEID

Norville News: Ready for more upheaval on the "Today" show? The talk around NBC 
News these days is that "Today's" national correspondent, Katie Couric, will 
take over as the show's co-host when Deborah Norville goes on maternity leave 
next spring. 
</P>
<P>
"She's no substitute -- she's the successor," one NBC News source told TV 
Guide. "Deborah's a bright woman but she doesn't come across that way on 
camera. She comes across as plastic. Katie's real." For the record, Don Browne, 
executive vice president of NBC News, denied that Norville is on the outs. BETH

The art of letter-writing has been murdered by the telephone. Who goes to the 
trouble of taking pen in hand, rustling up a stamp and and an envelope and 
tracking down a mailbox when Ma Bell is never more than a few feet away? 
Fortunately that hasn't always been the case, as the letters of several great 
figures of history have shed invaluable light on their work as well as their 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"Letters by Artists: From Rubens to Picasso," a selection of letters by artists 
on view indefinitely at the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, offers a 
fascinating peek at the daily lives of several important artists. The show 
would be a voyeur's dream but for the frustrating fact that all but a few of 
the letters are in foreign languages (mostly French), and the curators have 
inexplicably neglected to post translations. Instead, they supply brief 
biographical sketches of the artists, along with highlights of the exhibited 
letter -- better than nothing, but not as much as one wants. 
</P>
<P>
With what is gleaned from posted information, one discovers that most of these 
letters tend to demystify the men who wrote them (the letters are all by men, 
by the way). Included are letters by Lawrence Alma-Tadema, Camille Corot, 
Gustave Courbet, George Cruikshank, Edgar Degas, Paul Klee and Peter Paul 
Rubens, along with several others. 
</P>
<P>
Among the highlights: Paul Gauguin drops a note to his pal Camille Pissarro 
telling him "No money and no means of earning any for 5 or 6 months. I dare not 
think about the future." (Money woes turn up in letters by several artists.) In 
another letter, Gauguin protests the treatment of the Tahitian people by the 
French police, while Edouard Manet invites a friend to stop by and see the 
lovely flowers in his garden. 
</P>
<P>
Matisse writes a model to tell her he will be painting fruits and flowers so 
she should feel free to go to the beach, Picasso sends a complimentary note to 
Serge Diaghilev, and in a letter written to a collector of Surrealism, Man Ray 
rattles on about business with the informed enthusiasm of an unabashed 
careerist. Writing to two friends, Pissarro requests medicine for his chronic 
stomach ailment from one and comments on the dangers of the new Paris subway to 
the other, while Pierre Auguste Renoir announces to his friend Paul Berard; "I 
have left Paris like a bum to escape because I am ill." So much for the glamour 
of bohemia, one concludes after perusing this deliciously intimate little 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Bravo's View: On view in a faraway gallery (the Norton Simon is an extremely 
vast treasure house) is a selection of 26 photographs by Mexican photographer 
Manuel Alvarez Bravo. Bravo, who was born in 1902, began taking pictures in 
1924 and worked steadily as a photographer throughout his life. He remained 
largely unknown outside his native country, however, until 1971 when his first 
North American retrospective brought him wide acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
Bravo is generally acknowledged to have captured the essence of Mexican life in 
his pictures. A sophisticated man with many influential friends, he never lost 
his connection with the poverty, the magic, and the intense relationship with 
God and nature at the heart of Mexican culture, and these vivid themes are at 
the heart of his work. 
</P>
<P>
Bravo was friends with Diego Rivera, whose populist sympathies are reflected in 
these photographs (folk art motifs abound in work by both artists), and during 
the '30s he was smitten with the Surrealist movement blossoming in Europe. As 
with Surrealism, Bravo's images shimmer with a dreamy, hallucinatory quality, 
and seem to suggest that everyday occurences are ever on the verge of exploding 
into the supernatural. Mostly, however, Bravo's work is evocative of the great 
Spanish filmmaker and anarchist Luis Bunuel. Like Bunuel, Bravo views the 
cruelty of nature and the ephemeral quality of life with stoical black humor. 
</P>
<P>
Death is everywhere for Bravo, whose childhood memories include grisly scenes 
of Mexico's revolution of 1910, and symbols from the Day of the Dead turn up in 
several of his pictures. Other images depict a handsome young worker slain for 
going on strike, a freshly filled grave, a mummified infant, and the bones of 
an animal in the dust. Death is treated as no big deal in Bravo's world, a part 
of daily existence no more significant than any other fact of life; he is blase 
about death, yes, but this point of view doesn't make for particularly 
light-hearted images, and the subjects in Bravo's pictures rarely smile. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, we see a somber people who seem gravely aware of both the fragility and 
the resilience of existence. In a particularly concise image from 1933 we see a 
lovely young girl -- she's like a beautiful flower just beginning to open -- 
who holds a skull made of spun sugar and stares into the camera with an 
inscrutable gaze. She seems at once oblivious to and painfully aware of her own 
mortality. 
</P>
<P>
June's Mouse: In the gallery adjoining the Bravo show is "Prints From the 
Tamarind Workshop: The First Decade," an homage to the first 10 years of 
production at this legendary print shop. Including 62 prints by 17 artists, the 
show doubles as a catalogue of modernist styles: Pop, Minimalism, 
Expressionism, Biomorphic Abstraction -- a little bit of everything passed 
through the lithography presses at Tamarind. 
</P>
<P>
Launched in 1960 by June Wayne, Tamarind was designed to revitalize the medium 
of lithography, a neglected art form Wayne described as "a dying mouse" before 
her reclamation effort. A versatile, complex process that exploits the 
incompatibility of oil and water, lithography experienced a tremendous surge in 
popularity with the help of Wayne, and Tamarind attracted the leading lights of 
the '60s art world to come and collaborate with master printers. In 1970, 
Tamarind relocated to Albuquerque, thus ending the chapter under examination 
here -- a chapter many consider to be the glory days of printmaking. 
</P>
<P>
Though artists from around the world made their way to Tamarind (British artist 
Allen Jones, along with New Yorkers Louise Nevelson, Leon Golub and Lee 
Mullican are all represented here), the show is dominated by Los Angeles' 
leading artists of the '60s. Ken Price, John Altoon, Sam Francis and Richard 
Diebenkorn are all on hand, as is Ed Ruscha, who's represented by two works 
depicting the Hollywood sign. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Moses executed a complex multiple involving paper cut-outs, and these crisp 
little numbers look quite handsome next to a series of Josef Albers studies in 
color theory. Billy Al Bengston offers the wickedly beautiful "Mecca Dracula," 
a work from 1968 that combines the voluptuous beauty of an Iris with the 
ominous form of a bat. It's a disturbingly compelling image, at once evil and 
seductive. Vija Celmins' 1970 black-and-white study of the ocean has a similar 
allure; a black-and-white photo realist rendering of a patch of ocean water, 
calm yet pulsing with power, the image is marked by a contained fury that's 
like a metaphor for the printmaking medium itself.

'TCHAIKOVSKY': VIVID HUMAN DRAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HENKEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though taped last summer, "IX International Tchaikovsky Competition" remains a 
topical testimony to the ongoing Moscow jitters. Nervous and edgy, but with the 
excitement of the music ultimately dominating the more ominous political and 
social undercurrents, this 90-minute documentary (tonight at 8 on Channels 28 
and 50, and at 9 on Channels 24 and 15) is consistently engrossing on many 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
There are some extraordinary performances here, particularly in the later, more 
extended excerpts. As with most major competitions, the emphasis is on fingers 
of steel -- and nerves to match -- and displays of bravura and determination 
abound, from gold medalists pianist Boris Berezovsky and violinist Akaki 
Suwanai among others. 
</P>
<P>
But this is not principally a music show, as much as it is a remarkably candid 
show about musicians and competitions, with a pertinent travelogue subtext. 
Written and directed by Bill Fertik for KCET and Dalrymple Productions, 
"Tchaikovsky Competition" is at its best among the contestants themselves, 
backstage and on the street as well as in performance. 
</P>
<P>
Offstage, two U.S. fiddlers, Frank Almond and David Kim, carry much of the 
early commentary, until Almond is shattered by his first-round elimination. 
Many of the musicians express wonder over seemingly inexplicable judging, and 
disillusionment with competitions in general. 
</P>
<P>
Then the focus shifts to Berezovsky and his blossoming friendship with Stephen 
Prutsman, who eventually ties for fourth place. We follow Prutsman into the 
Moscow streets, where agitprop theater and corner demagogues seem to flourish 
now. The unrest is clear, the brittle expectancy often veering from hope to 
fear within a single short interview. 
</P>
<P>
The event itself is not free from pressures. We find the competition chairman 
worrying about lack of funding and wondering if this might not be the last 
Tchaikovsky Competition, and we also follow the story of a far-reaching, 
expensive effort to bribe jury members by an unnamed pianist's relatives. 
</P>
<P>
But at the end is some amazingly focused music-making. Despite an inept 
orchestra, intermittent supplies of food and hot water, and all the 
increasingly scrutinized inequities of the competition environment, hardy 
musicians survive, and incredibly so does Tchaikovsky, and Rachmaninoff, and 
Chopin. . . .JOHN HENKEN

For all those who have wondered what happens to a famine when it leaves the 
front page or if children stop dying just because cameras stop recording, 
photojournalist Sebastiao Salgado provides an answer. Surprisingly, it's not a 
completely sad revelation, as we see in "An Uncertain Grace: Photographs by 
Sebastiao Salgado," an exhibition of more than 120 images from 1977 to the 
present. Organized by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the show is now 
presented by UCLA's Grunwald Center at the Frederick W. Wight Art Gallery (to 
Jan. 27). It's a penetrating, emotional, romantic and exhilarating look at 
lives shaped by survival by an artist who finds beauty and dignity amid the 
desperate poverty of Third World nations. 
</P>
<P>
This collection of images was gathered from scattered locations around the 
world, but it has an amazing depth. It's the kind of firsthand thoroughness 
that can only be harvested from prolonged stays in troubled areas. Salgado 
frequently spends weeks in refugee camps where other photojournalists may work 
for a couple of hours. Instead of providing one or two touching images on 
newsworthy subjects, Salgado, in dozens of photographs, builds a cumulative 
portrait of a dignified people sustained by faith. This subjective immersion 
gives his black and white pictures an uninhibited intimacy. It also softens, 
though it can't completely mitigate, the camera's voyeuristic intrusion on 
private moments of anguish over an emaciated child's slow death or hopelessness 
brought on by overwork or starvation. 
</P>
<P>
Salgado came to photography after beginning a career as an economic adviser to 
developing nations. At 29, while working on assignment in Africa, he made some 
photographs with his wife's camera that persuaded him of the power for social 
change inherent in revealing the faces of the people behind disaster and poor 
public policy. Since then, he has roamed the world, mixing newspaper and 
magazine assignments with photography work for relief groups, such as the 
all-volunteer Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), which treats 
people in remote areas when catastrophe strikes. Ironically, his work came to 
global prominence with a single, dynamic image that was published worldwide 
showing Ronald Reagan and James Brady felled in John W. Hinckley's 
assassination attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Salgado's photojournalistic mission on behalf of the invisible people of the 
Third World recalls the emotional, potent images of Dorothea Lange's Depression 
photographs of migrant workers taken for the Farm Securities Administration, 
but he is more directly related to Henri Cartier-Bresson, founder of Magnum 
Photos, the agency through which Salgado works. Both Salgado and 
Cartier-Bresson favor somewhat narrative, dramatic images but seem equally 
aware that they are conjuring up distinctly edited versions of reality. 
Salgado's pictures, with their emphasis on the self-respect lighting the faces 
of tired sugar cane cutters in Cuba, or the athletic beauty of bodies 
struggling on slippery ground in Brazil's Serra Pelada gold mine, cast these 
men and their labor in a noble light. 
</P>
<P>
As a contradiction to the Western notion that heavy exertion is always without 
dignity, Salgado's photographs are powerfully didactic. Yet they are also 
decidedly biased, ignoring extended social conditions such as the alcoholism 
and crime that are also part of the men's marginal existence. But Salgado is 
giving the faceless -- known only to developed countries by the depths of their 
depravation -- a more rounded identity. Though he now lives in Paris, he was 
born and raised in Brazil and is forever aware of the "otherness" that the poor 
rural peasant feels within that country's social structure. Because he spends 
time with the people he photographs, he knows them as people, not simply 
statistics. His pictures reveal their unwavering, stoic endurance of the 
harshness of their environment. Their labor flames with Social Realism's brand 
of evangelism. The depths of their faith has an almost mystic aura: Children in 
procession are more angels than mortals; a father holding his child has the 
same soulful eyes as the Christ poster on the wall beside him. 
</P>
<P>
Discussing only the social content of Salgado's photographs leaves unspoken the 
power of the images themselves, however. Each picture is an arresting 
composition that uses the full potency of light and dark to create mood and 
sculptural mass. His compositional skill is so finely developed that it is 
frequently difficult to remember that these pictures are taken spontaneously in 
the most isolated of areas, under challenging conditions. Were it not for the 
harsh reality of the subjects, the elegance of the forms and the beauty of the 
photographs would be a pure delight. 
</P>
<P>
Salgado's skill as an artist illuminates the lives of the Third World poor. His 
photographs are elegant, thought-provoking statements that repeatedly make 
issues like starvation or poverty confrontational, instead of abstract. It's 
not pity you feel when you see a an emaciated Ethiopian father carrying the 
skin and bones body of his child into the refugee center, it's an incredible 
sense of waste. Their humanity is commanding, their capacity to survive 
awesome. 
</P>
<P>
It has often been observed that adversity brings out the best in all of us. 
Perhaps, but it also brings out anger. The subtext to Salgado's photographs, 
only peripherally hinted at in the abbreviated information appended to each 
photo, is the political shenanigans and economic policies responsible for so 
many of these "natural" disasters/social realities. Salgado doesn't make a 
point of damning the infrastructures his work necessarily describes. He simply 
lets the image and a few facts open up questions. 
</P>
<P>
As potent as this kind of photojournalism is, it is also singularly absent from 
much of the media coverage that makes up the daily news. An AIDS patient here, 
a homeless family there, the news skims its subjects with sound bites and 
on-the-spot superficial coverage. It's been ages since Americans were 
confronted with the innumerable, searing pictures that unmasked the futility of 
Vietnam or the desperation of Bangladesh. Only a few of Salgado's beautiful, 
haunting pictures from the Ethiopian Sahel were published in Newsweek and the 
New York Times at the time they were made. The rest were considered "too 
tragic" to be marketable by U.S. literary publishers or gallery owners, so the 
complete series was never seen in this country, until now. Time may have 
rendered these news images "safe" for American sensibilities, but they are 
still potent. And their breadth of involvement offers a dynamic model for art 
working with a social conscience.

The critics agree: Francis Ford Coppola's long-awaited "The Godfather Part III" 
is not as good as its 1972 and 1974 predecessors, but given the series' appeal 
and the weak competition among holiday movies, it offers an alternative that 
moviegoers shouldn't refuse. The critics found plenty to fault with "Part III" 
-- which opens today -- most notably the casting of Sofia Coppola, the 
director's teen-age daughter, in a pivotal role. Said Time magazine's Richard 
Corliss: "(Her) gosling gracelessness comes close to wrecking the movie." 
</P>
<P>
The New York Post's Jami Bernard went a little further, declaring that "Coppola 
has virtually ruined his movie by casting (her)," and added "there'll be hell 
to pay around the Coppola house after Sofia's notices come out." 
</P>
<P>
Gene Siskel, of "Siskel &amp; Ebert at the Movies," found her "out of her 
acting league." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Channel 7's Gary Franklin, called the casting of Sofia 
Coppola "inspired," saying her character was "magnificently played" and, on an 
ensuing broadcast, read aloud the grateful telegram he received from her 
father. 
</P>
<P>
Other Sofia Coppola defenders included Roger Ebert, who said she added to the 
movie "through the very freshness of her unstudied and direct performance," and 
Owen Gleiberman, of Entertainment Weekly, who said, "this non-actress has a 
ripe adolescent sexiness." 
</P>
<P>
The script, credited to Coppola and Mario Puzo, his collaborator on the first 
two "Godfathers," also came in for frequent attack. Ebert, Siskel's on-air 
partner in a syndicated TV movie review show, said the script "seems kind of 
half-baked or half-finished." The Los Angeles Daily News' Bob Strauss called it 
the film's "big minus." 
</P>
<P>
A number of others noted that the third installment of the Corleone family's 
struggle seems to have personal and professional parallels to Coppola's own 
life. With a nod to the filmmaker's much-publicized financial woes and recent 
film failures, the Boston Phoenix' Peter Keough observed that while the film's 
central character, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), is in need of redemption, 
"Coppola is even more so -- not just from debts, but from mediocrity" 
</P>
<P>
Michael Clark gave the film three out of four stars in USA Today, and suggested 
that "Part III" derives its stature "weighed solely against too many 
underwhelming holiday pictures." 
</P>
<P>
Few critics, even among "Part III's" strongest fans, compared it favorably to 
its predecessors, and some -- like the Today Show's Gene Shalit -- bluntly 
dismissed it as a major failure. Lawrence Toppman, of the Charlotte Observer, 
referred to "ludicrous plot twists" and "shallow characterizations" and added, 
"the central plot drowns in subplots and extraneous details like a mammoth 
sinking into a tar pit." 
</P>
<P>
The Times' Michael Wilmington, in a lengthy review in Sunday's Calendar, 
expressed disappointment with the script and said the film was inevitably 
flawed by the loss of Robert Duvall's Tom Hagen character, but measured against 
the standards of today's filmmaking, it's still "one of the best American 
movies of the year." Wilmington, Sheila Benson and Kevin Thomas all included 
"Godfather III" in their year-end Top 10 lists, also published Sunday in 
Calendar. 
</P>
<P>
Excerpts from other "Godfather III" reviews: 
</P>
<P>
* "A meandering but finally quite affecting climax to the saga . . . a slow 
fuse with a big bang" -- Richard Corliss, Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
* "Not in the same league as the first two films in the series, but, how many 
films are?" -- Gene Siskel of "Siskel &amp; Ebert at the Movies," who, along 
with reviewer Roger Ebert, gave the film a "thumbs-up." 
</P>
<P>
* "(The film) is well-crafted and looks good. But unlike 'Godfather' and 
'Godfather II,' it is not a masterpiece. The disappointment can be crushing" -- 
Jami Bernard, New York Post. 
</P>
<P>
* "The third best of (Coppola's) epic cycle . . . against all odds, Coppola has 
capped off one of the great achievements of true popular culture" -- Jack 
Kroll, Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
* "A rich, resonant and deeply felt conclusion to the greatest and longest 
gangster movie of all time" -- Jim Emerson, Orange County Register. 
</P>
<P>
* "Not a masterpiece, perhaps, but the work of a masterful filmmaker . . . it 
is a work at one with its virtues and faults, a unified and fractured film. It 
is hellaciously stimulating" -- Henry Sheehan, L.A. Reader. 
</P>
<P>
* "Overstuffed and irresistible . . . few films in recent memory have offered 
as much bravura, cinematic pleasure" -- Bob Strauss, Los Angeles Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
* "(The film) represents a level of storytelling magic a few notches shy of the 
original two films. But it is painfully genuine . . . you feel Coppola's full 
engagement at the emotional level" -- Stephen Hunter, Baltimore Sun. 
</P>
<P>
* "Coppola's masterful gangster saga comes full circle with a vengeance -- and 
heart-wrenching triumph" -- Tom Sabulis, San Jose Mercury-News. 
</P>
<P>
* "The narrative urgency is simply not there anymore . . . (but) for all its 
flaws, (the film) is a thoroughly admirable achievement" -- Andrew Sarris, New 
York Observer.

ATHLETICS AT USIU IN PERIL; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCIAL WOES: BASKETBALL COACH SAYS HE HASN'T RECEIVED A PAYCHECK IN TWO 
WEEKS.

<P>
The future of intercollegiate athletics at U.S. International University 
appears to be in jeopardy after the school filed for bankruptcy last week in a 
desperate move to save itself through economic reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
USIU Athletic Director Al Palmiotto said Monday the fate of the school's 12 
Division I sports programs will be determined by the its board of trustees in a 
meeting Friday, and the outcome could range from minor adjustments to the total 
elimination of sports at USIU. 
</P>
<P>
Palmiotto said he made "several proposals" on restructuring the athletic 
department to Kenneth McLennan, the university's acting president, last week. 
But he declined to reveal the details of his proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Palmiotto stressed his desire to preserve all of the Gulls' sports programs 
while cutting costs in what he described as an already bare-bones athletic 
budget. He also expressed concern that the school might not maintain its NCAA 
Division I status and that abolition of sports would hurt its marketability 
with prospective students. 
</P>
<P>
Any decision Friday by the trustees could affect the cornerstone of USIU 
athletics, its men's basketball team, which faces the possibility of becoming 
extinct in midseason. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls are scheduled to play two home games at Golden Hall this week. 
Palmiotto said those games will be played. But by Jan. 3, the day Northwestern 
State is scheduled to play the Gulls here, USIU basketball could be a thing of 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea what (McLennan) is going to do," Palmiotto said. "(But) having 
no athletics at an undergraduate institution will definitely put a big, big 
problem on the board. Most undergraduates look for those intangibles that you 
can't put your finger on. And one of them happens to be athletics." 
</P>
<P>
USIU filed for protection under Chapter 11 Thursday because Mission Federal 
Credit Union threatened foreclosure of a 70-acre portion of its 200-acre 
campus. The parcel, which would have been collateral on a $3.5-million loan, 
included athletic facilities. Now the university will work with a federal court 
to develop a plan for solving its long-running financial turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
McLennan, who became the acting interim president in January, said he will 
review proposals from all administrators from each department on campus, but 
said USIU's athletics and its highly regarded arts curricula would likely be 
the first to be cut. 
</P>
<P>
Palmiotto suggested that his programs operate on such a strict budget already 
that the only thing left are the programs themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're faced with something like this, you've just got to go straight for 
the hard line," he said. "I think the hard line is going through a pared-down 
schedule and trying to cut in areas that won't have an impact on the very 
essence of safety: food, lodging, things like that. 
</P>
<P>
"My budget is very honest. It's a very honest assessment of what it takes to 
run a Division I (program) without all the frills and all the hoopla. I don't 
have a marching band. I don't have football. I don't have cheerleaders. We 
don't have a gymnasium. Those are big cost items. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we have a little less in cash flow than we need. We have it in 
property, but not in cash flow." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Zarecky, the men's basketball coach who has never had a winning season in 
five-plus years at USIU, hinted that minimal financial resources might be one 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the smallest men's basketball budget in the country," he said. "And 
one of the most difficult things I've ever had to do with coaching is trying to 
deal with what's been going on in our athletic department. I've been motivated 
for six years at USIU by all the negatives. Now I've been thrown a curve." 
</P>
<P>
Zarecky said he hasn't received a paycheck in two months and that he never was 
paid for a previous three-month period of work. He said USIU's move to 
bankruptcy became a headline story in Dayton, Ohio, where the Gulls were 
competing in the US Air Tournament Friday and Saturday, and that his players 
were "devastated" when he broke the news to them shortly before their opener 
against Murray State. 
</P>
<P>
The Gulls (1-12) lost both games, by margins of 48 and 42 points. 
</P>
<P>
"My players are not deserting me," Zarecky said. "The team wants to overcome 
this. My heart and my feelings go out to my players right now." 
</P>
<P>
Palmiotto said Monday that he felt like he was sitting in a doctor's office 
waiting to find out whether he had terminal cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know which way we're going," he said. "Is he going to come out of the 
room saying, 'Bless you, child. You've got another 50 years' or 'I'm sorry to 
have to tell you . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
Also at stake are the futures of the following USIU programs: baseball, 
softball, women's volleyball, and men's and women's tennis, cross-country, 
soccer and golf. The Gulls have competed in Division I since the 1979-1980 
school year, and for them to maintain that status on a probationary basis they 
must finish the year with eight sports in the program (four men's and four 
women's) with at least two competing during spring, fall and winter seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Should the trustees cut any USIU sports, Palmiotto said athletes would retain 
their scholarships until the end of the season. He was not clear, however, 
about the eligibility status of USIU's basketball players, who have played 
nearly half their season. The NCAA normally does not restore a year of 
eligibility to an athlete if he or she has played in more than 20% of the 
scheduled games. 
</P>
<P>
Palmiotto is not only gravely concerned for the future of athletics at USIU, 
but is steadfast in his belief that eliminating them will only add to problems 
in the ensuing years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very important to hold some kind of program together," he said. 
"I don't think they should just go through and cut just because they can save 
$50,000 $100,000, $200,000. I think they have to look at the whole domino 
effect. I think it's essential to keep a core of everything they have that 
makes the university what it is. 
</P>
<P>
"The only two things that are auxiliary at that university that are truly big 
league are the performing arts and athletics. I think if they drop them 
totally, it would be a hard hill to climb back up."

COLLEGE FOOTBALL: BRIGHAM YOUNG UNIVERSITY QUARTERBACK DETMER NEVER LET THE

<P>
Ring! 
</P>
<P>
The telephone. It kept . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Ring! 
</P>
<P>
 Ringing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ring! 
</P>
<P>
 All through the day, and into the night. 
</P>
<P>
Girls. Guys. Kids. Wanting to hear that voice. Ty's voice. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, Ty Detmer and his four roommates would take the calls in stride. The 
Heisman Trophy hype had started in the summer, and they were still young. None 
of them had ever been through anything like this before. How bad could it get, 
really? 
</P>
<P>
There were times when they were amused by the whole scene. It was fall. They 
liked fall. It was football season, and this Heisman stuff was kind of a kick. 
</P>
<P>
Until they would try to sleep in on a Sunday after getting back from a road 
trip late Saturday. These were the times when they felt like ripping the phone 
out of the wall and tossing it out the window. 
</P>
<P>
It never stopped. Owning their number became a status symbol in Provo, Utah, 
like having the latest pair of Nikes. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know, a student-teacher at a high school told us he saw a girl walking 
down the hall saying 'I got Ty Detmer's phone number,' and passing it out," 
said David Henderson, one of Detmer's roommates and a second-team defensive 
back. "We got so many hang-ups." 
</P>
<P>
At its peak, the house answering machine was taking about 100 calls a day. 
Incredibly, BYU student information was giving out Detmer's phone number to 
anyone who asked. Henderson said the roommates called information and asked the 
campus operator to stop giving it out, and he said he would post a note. 
</P>
<P>
That was a couple of days before BYU stunned then-No.1 Miami in Provo. By the 
end of that game, it was apparent that this would not be a normal year in 
Provo. Ty Detmer became the Heisman front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of days after the Miami game, Henderson said they again called BYU 
information. This time they simply asked for Ty's number. They got it. No 
problem, thank you for using BY &amp; U. So much for posting a note. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, it finally got to be too much. Detmer and his roommates, a bit 
older and wiser, had their phone number changed to an unlisted one. 
</P>
<P>
But they couldn't very easily change their doorbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Ring! 
</P>
<P>
 The five of them -- four football players and a wrestler -- live in a rented 
house in what once was a quiet neighborhood. Lots of families. Lots of kids. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids go to school and tell their friends they know where Ty Detmer lives," 
Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ring! 
</P>
<P>
 "According to them, the other kids don't believe them, so they want 
autographs." 
</P>
<P>
They also want to play football in the front yard. During the season, Detmer 
and Co. rarely had time to do so. Once the season is finished, though, 
Henderson said, they play more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, there will be games in the front yard. This week, though, the 
neighborhood turns its attention from the house down the street to San Diego. 
The Heisman Trophy winner arrives in town this afternoon, and San Diegans are 
getting spoiled. Not only does the Holiday Bowl have a history of nail-biting 
finishes, now, it has a Heisman history. Barry Sanders two years ago, now 
Detmer. Two winners in three bowl games. And Detmer played last year as well. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a shy, polite, mischievous, 22-year-old quarterback who could just as 
easily fit into a Boy Scout troop, this has been one of the wildest and 
craziest seasons in BYU history. According to BYU's sports information people, 
no other athlete in BYU history has generated this much interest. Not Jim 
McMahon. Not Steve Young. Not Robbie Bosco or Michael Smith or Danny Ainge. 
Nobody. 
</P>
<P>
The madness began during the summer, with the manufacturing of Heisman "ties" 
and the plotting of the hype. It was the Miami game that turned Provo inside 
out. But Detmer's solid-gold season opened a week before Miami, in his native 
Texas . . . 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 1, in El Paso, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
BYU 30, Texas El Paso 10 
</P>
<P>
Imagine. You are a shy college student who loves playing football. You also 
love to hunt, because it gets you out into the woods, away from the daily grind 
and limelight. You are the focus of your team, and nearly every time you step 
into a room, people know who you are. 
</P>
<P>
You are in El Paso, and these wacky BYU fans are wearing blue ties with your 
name and No. 14 on them. Heisman Tys. 
</P>
<P>
You are getting ready to open the season in the midst of all of this madness. 
And then, while standing in the lobby of the team hotel, you see your mother 
heading toward you . . . and she is wearing a big button on her blouse. The 
button has your picture on it. 
</P>
<P>
"A head shot," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, mercy. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Detmer had flown in from the family home in Mission, Tex. What with her 
husband and another son involved with high school football, and one daughter in 
school and the other married, it would be her only chance to see Ty play in 
person this season. 
</P>
<P>
It was an interesting opening, and not only because Detmer passed for 387 
yards. He surprised BYU Coach LaVell Edwards by getting an unsportsmanlike 
conduct penalty. Later, there was a brawl, and one of the Texas papers splashed 
a big picture of Ty in the middle of the fight across the page. 
</P>
<P>
"Mild-mannered Ty was pictured fixin' to slug someone," Betty said. "He had 
some guy by the face mask. Koy (Ty's 17-year-old brother) loved it." 
</P>
<P>
Today, that picture hangs on the bulletin board of Koy's room. 
</P>
<P>
The Heisman Tour '90 was off to a rousing start. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 8, in Provo 
</P>
<P>
BYU 28, Miami 21 
</P>
<P>
Nighttime. There is a big, white "Y" on a mountaintop overlooking Provo. 
Somebody makes his way toward it. A "T" is planted in front of the "Y". All set 
for game day. 
</P>
<P>
"Half the people thought this was our first game," Detmer said. "It was really 
big. Students on campus wished you good luck everywhere you went." 
</P>
<P>
This was a turning point as far as the Heisman race was concerned. Detmer 
completed a season-high 38 of 54 passes for 406 yards and three touchdowns in 
front of a sellout crowd and national ESPN audience. He did this despite 
receiving a cut on his chin that took six stitches. 
</P>
<P>
Ring! In Mission, the Detmer family's phone rang all that night and the next 
day. Friends, relatives . . . excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Ring! Ty called the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just elated when we talked to him," Betty Detmer said. "I don't think 
his chin even hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 15, in Provo 
</P>
<P>
BYU 50, Washington State 36 
</P>
<P>
To win the Heisman, you need several things: Talent. Publicity. Statistics. And 
maybe a little bit of magic. 
</P>
<P>
Against Washington State, Detmer had it all. 
</P>
<P>
Miami week was over, and talk about letdowns: BYU trailed at halftime, 29-7. 
Suddenly, Detmer threw three fourth-quarter touchdowns and led a comeback. He 
finished with 448 yards passing and five touchdown passes. His legend was 
sealed. 
</P>
<P>
The Heisman is also timing. The Cougars were scheduled to appear on CBS against 
San Diego State the next week, and because of that, CBS had a crew there for 
this game. 
</P>
<P>
"The CBS crew was there, and they kept feeding updates back to the stations," 
BYU Coach LaVell Edwards said. "You couldn't have written a better script." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, no need to worry about Detmer's ego with his roommates around. They 
kid him so much there is no way Detmer can get a big head. Hubert, they call 
him. That is Ty's middle name. Hubert. After his grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really good for Ty to live with those guys," Betty Detmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 22, in Provo 
</P>
<P>
BYU 62, San Diego State 34 
</P>
<P>
An hour before game time. Detmer is loosening up by taking snaps and rolling 
right and then left. You've heard of the two-step drop? Well, a CBS cameraman 
is about two steps from Detmer, filming everything. 
</P>
<P>
Interest in Detmer was so high that CBS decided to show this game to about 80% 
of the nation. It was originally scheduled as a regional game. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it turns out, Detmer's roommates aren't the only ones who get on him 
about the Heisman stuff. His father, Sonny, usually lets him have it during his 
one or two calls home each week. When Ty calls, he answers the phone, "Stud." 
That always gets a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
There have been quite a few serious moments, too. Ty had been depressed after 
the UTEP game. He didn't think he played well. Imagine passing for 387 yards 
and one touchdown and not thinking you played well. 
</P>
<P>
"If it is not any fun any more, you need to find something else to do," Sonny 
told Ty then. 
</P>
<P>
After playing well against Miami and Washington State, Ty shredded SDSU for 514 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it was fun again. 
</P>
<P>
Sept. 29, in Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon 32, BYU 16 
</P>
<P>
His hand ached. His right hand. The passing one. He had banged it on a helmet 
against Washington State, and then dinged it again against SDSU. Detmer didn't 
practice all week because of an injured hand. It showed. Five of his passes 
were intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
"Ty died in Eugene," screamed the broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the season, 28 of Detmer's passes were be intercepted, and each 
Heisman watcher had his own opinion. Detmer may have handled the predictions 
better than his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"One day it's 'St. Ty of the Football,' so much glory he could do no wrong," 
Betty Detmer said. "The next day, it's 'He's only 5-11 and can't throw the 
football more than 20 yards, and it's all wobbly.' I'd be so mad I could just 
spit." 
</P>
<P>
As if the loss and five interceptions weren't enough, one of Detmer's 
roommates, Rick Evans -- the wrestler -- is from Oregon. All week, he had been 
talking about Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
"Oregon guys are tougher than guys from Texas," he told Detmer and Henderson, 
both of whom are from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
When the team got back and Detmer returned to the house, Evans just sat there. 
Grinning. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 6, in the mountains 
</P>
<P>
By mid-December, many of the weekends would become a blur to Detmer. Not this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
"Got an elk that weekend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With a week off, his hand was placed in a removable cast. He removed the cast 
long enough to go hunting. 
</P>
<P>
The Detmer family joke is that one reason they don't go to a psychiatrist is 
that they spend time in the woods. Quiet time, where they can sort out their 
thoughts and feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 13, in Provo 
</P>
<P>
BYU 52, Colorado State 9 
</P>
<P>
The sign appeared on their door the night after the game. Some girls left it, 
asking Detmer and Henderson to go out with them. Detmer and Henderson read the 
sign and thought, why not? 
</P>
<P>
They went out to eat. They played miniature golf. They took a picture. Next 
thing anybody knew, Ty and his blind date were pictured on wedding 
announcements distributed around campus. 
</P>
<P>
If there's anything he loves as much as football and hunting, it's a good 
prank. A few teammates got him on this one. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder Henderson talked Detmer into going. He knew it was a set-up all 
along. 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 20, in the mountains 
</P>
<P>
Another bye, another weekend clearly in focus. 
</P>
<P>
"Got a deer that weekend," Detmer said. 
</P>
<P>
By now, with the telephone ringing and the press hounding, the woods and 
mountains were the only place he could get any rest. His cousin, Freddie 
Buchholz, was with him, and Buchholz got a real eye opener when a local 
television station did a live remote and showed Ty building a fire and telling 
hunting tales. 
</P>
<P>
So much for Detmer's peace. 
</P>
<P>
Buchholz, meanwhile, spent the night at Ty's house. 
</P>
<P>
So much for Buchholz's peace. 
</P>
<P>
"Freddie said the phone never stopped ringing," Betty Detmer said. "He was glad 
to get out of there, he said." 
</P>
<P>
By now, things were going well off the field as well as on. It was about this 
time that Detmer got a girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Her name is Kim Herbert, and she is 22. Mainly, she and Detmer spend time at 
her house or in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
"It would probably be difficult for them to make a movie," Henderson said. "On 
time, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
She gives his roommates and Eric Mortensen, a teammate, all the ammunition they 
need. Mortensen, you see, had a pretty serious girlfriend for about two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Ty always used to talk about it," Henderson said. "About how he was spending 
so much time taking her out to eat, and how much money he was spending. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's all swung back to Ty." 
</P>
<P>
As for Detmer's family, Herbert has already passed inspection. Sonny saw her 
playing softball in July and, well . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He said she could hit hard and run well," Betty Detmer said. "Is that a 
coach's impression or what?" 
</P>
<P>
Oct. 27, in Provo 
</P>
<P>
BYU 55, New Mexico 31 
</P>
<P>
Homecoming. Pep rallies. Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
Sharks? 
</P>
<P>
Ty Detmer, Mr. Heisman Trophy candidate, took three stitches in his left hand a 
few days before the game when he punctured it dissecting a shark. 
</P>
<P>
The way Evans tells the story, one of the girls in class couldn't cut through 
the shark skin, so Detmer decided to help. 
</P>
<P>
Ring! 
</P>
<P>
When Detmer called home, Sonny answered while humming the "Jaws" theme. 
</P>
<P>
The wound wasn't serious enough for Detmer to skip the game. He passed for 464 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 3, in Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
BYU 54, Air Force 7 
</P>
<P>
You play football in the East, you see all kinds of weather. You play football 
in the West, you don't worry so much about the elements. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
"First time I played in snow," Detmer said. "It was a lot of fun. It's a lot 
better than playing in rain. The ball doesn't get wet." 
</P>
<P>
Not many could tell he had never played in snow -- he passed for 397 yards and 
three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Detmer's parents watched the game on satellite television. This is 
how they saw most of his games. A friend had his television hooked up to a 
satellite dish, a local cafe in Mission also had one and near the end of the 
season, the booster club had a satellite dish installed at Koy's high school. 
The only game they missed was the Hawaii game. As it would turn out, that was 
probably for the best. 
</P>
<P>
NOV. 10, in Laramie, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
BYU 45, Wyoming 14 
</P>
<P>
The game had long since ended. Detmer had another Detmer game, passing for 484 
yards. Edwards was on his way home. Suddenly, he was struck by a thought: Ty 
Detmer was going to win the Heisman. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards had called Detmer into his office several times in the past few months 
to talk to him about the Heisman. How to handle all of the media requests. How 
to handle all of the appearance requests. How are you doing, Ty? Is it too 
overwhelming? You OK? 
</P>
<P>
He always was. And now, for the first time, Edwards allowed himself to think in 
terms of Ty winning. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't until then that I thought it might happen," Edwards said. "I 
remember going home and telling my wife, 'You know, I really think Ty is going 
to win the thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 17, in Salt Lake City 
</P>
<P>
BYU 45, Utah 22 
</P>
<P>
The numbers continued to get larger. Detmer passed for 451 yards, increasing 
his career total to 10,106. He became the first junior to pass for more than 
10,000 yards in a career. By season's end, he would hold 42 NCAA records. This 
game was also noteworthy because BYU clinched the WAC title. 
</P>
<P>
The crunch on Detmer had become so strong during the season that BYU eventually 
quit setting up one-on-one telephone interviews. There was a weekly conference 
call, two if called for. Ralph Zobell, BYU sports information director, figured 
that by the end of the season, more than 100 people had interviewed Detmer just 
on the conference calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Saturdays have been fun," Detmer said. "Other than that, its been hectic. Each 
week, we got better and better and stayed in the spotlight." 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 24, in Provo 
</P>
<P>
BYU 45, Utah State 10 
</P>
<P>
Relief. The week before the Heisman ballots went in. Finally, the speculation 
was about to end. 
</P>
<P>
Disaster. Five interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Against Utah State? 
</P>
<P>
"Didn't go as well as we wanted it to," Detmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Edwards: "We'd won the championship and really had a hard time coming 
back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 1, Honolulu 
</P>
<P>
Heisman day 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii 59, BYU 28 
</P>
<P>
You don't describe the feeling of something like winning the Heisman Trophy in 
words. You do it through tears and laughs, and smiles and hugs. 
</P>
<P>
The Detmers had a feeling this would be a good day. Lori, 10 1/2 and the only 
girl playing in an organized flag football league in Mission, had a game that 
morning. After three earlier losses, her team finally won. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the Detmers got on their game clothes and drove to Kingsville for a 
playoff game. They got there early enough for a television hookup with Ty in 
Hawaii. Word came. He won. Sonny broke down crying. 
</P>
<P>
"Sonny broke down," Betty Detmer said. "He bawled. Our friends were laughing. 
He had told me, 'You're going to have to talk. This is getting to be too much 
for me.' " 
</P>
<P>
Oh, what a day. Later, Koy's team won its playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, what a week. Everyone except Koy went to New York for the Heisman ceremony. 
Betty and daughters Dee Dorman, 21, who is married, and Lori flew in Dec. 6. 
Sonny went the next day. Koy stayed behind so he wouldn't miss football 
practice during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone else met Ty and Kim and a few BYU representatives. 
</P>
<P>
His mother had not seen him since the first weekend in September in El Paso. 
His father hadn't seen him since early July. 
</P>
<P>
They picked up two trophies. One is at BYU. The other sits in his grandparents' 
house. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't been an easy year for them. Ty's grandfather, Hubert Sr., has cancer, 
and the Detmers know he probably will not be with them next football season. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe some kind of award should go to his grandparents. They, after all, are 
the ones who kept Ty's scrapbooks this fall. Betty's brother in St. Louis, 
sister in Corpus Christi, and friends in Indiana, Ohio and Florida would all 
send clippings, and his grandparents' house maybe was the biggest fire hazard 
in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
There will be more clippings. This winter: Will Ty apply early for the NFL 
draft? If not, next fall: Can Ty repeat his Heisman? 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said Detmer will forgo the NFL draft and return for a senior season at 
BYU. 
</P>
<P>
"And if he said he's coming back, you can just write it down," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
The months have worn on Detmer. It hasn't shown in public. There have been no 
reports of him losing his temper or being rude. But those who know him well 
have noticed a subtle change. They say he seems a little quieter, a little more 
worn out. 
</P>
<P>
After the Holiday Bowl, he will return to Mission with his mother and father in 
the family van. They figure to get home on New Year's Eve, and Ty will stay 
there for a week or so. He has asked his parents not to plan anything during 
that time. He would like to rest. 
</P>
<P>
There is always just one more day, though. That will come Saturday, when BYU 
tries to avenge last year's Holiday Bowl loss to Penn State. A couple of Ty's 
cousins from Texas will meet the Detmers in San Diego. And a few nights ago, 
Betty Detmer spoke with Ty on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"Ty," she told him. "It's going to be awful hard here in Texas if you don't 
beat A&amp;M." 
</P>
<P>
Ty Detmer has taken the attention and the publicity this year and thrown them 
50 yards downfield, and then been ready for more. And now, his mother was 
telling him how difficult it would be to live in Texas if BYU loses the Holiday 
Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
He laughed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

FRIESZ TO REPLACE TOLLIVER AS CHARGERS' STARTER

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The message is clear to Dan Henning: The Chargers, who have lost 13 games by 
seven or fewer points in the past two years, have to find a way to win close 
football games. 
</P>
<P>
To drive home that point to his players, Henning announced Monday that rookie 
John Friesz will replace Billy Joe Tolliver as the team's starting quarterback 
and will make his National Football League debut Sunday against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at a point of playing with some of these better teams, but we're not 
pulling it off," Henning said. "We'll not only activate John Friesz (off 
injured reserve), but he will start. How long he will play will depend on if 
he's competitive in helping us to win the football game. 
</P>
<P>
"That will give us an indication of what kind of competitor he will be for next 
year . . . We have to get the message across to our football team that we have 
to find more competition. I'd like to do it at other positions, but I don't 
have the players to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said he was just as disappointed with the erratic play of his defense 
as the play of Tolliver, but he said he doesn't have the defensive players to 
make wholesale changes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's some talent here to do better," Henning said. "Why that's not 
being done could have to do with the chemistry of our defense. If that means 
changing some players who are pretty good football players . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It's as significant for Billy what we're doing, as it is a symbol for the team 
to let them know we're not going to sit pat and think it's all right to just 
stay close to teams like Kansas City. We have to find a way to win." 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last week, however, Henning indicated it would be 
counterproductive, if not harmful, to Friesz's development to play him this 
season. Friesz has yet to take a snap in practice running the Charger offense. 
</P>
<P>
However, Tolliver has thrown three passes that were intercepted in the past two 
weeks. His final pass Sunday was intercepted by Kansas City's Deron Cherry with 
1:48 to play and allowed the Chiefs to clinch a playoff berth with a 24-21 
victory. The Chargers fell to 6-9. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if Billy Joe Tolliver had made the play at the end of the game, and 
that's where the fine line is drawn, he probably would have been named MVP of 
that game," Henning said. "I think Tolliver has a future as a quarterback in 
this league. 
</P>
<P>
"He does many many things far and above for a first- and second-year player at 
this stage of development. But he still has a track record in the last part of 
game of not making the play that needs to be made. That has to be taken into 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Henning met with his offensive coaching staff Monday morning and then consulted 
with the personnel department. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm taking into consideration the mixed opinions across the organization," 
Henning said. "There's still a number of people on the coaching staff and a few 
people in the personnel department that think it might not be the best for 
John, or the best for the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Then there's some people that feel dead opposite to that; they think we may 
find something in John Friesz . . . I'm not sure there's a majority." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said Tolliver still has his support, but he said Tolliver has to work 
on his shortcomings. He said Tolliver's interceptions have come in situations 
where he had the opportunity to throw the ball away or move on to a different 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
He said Tolliver has also failed to adjust mechanically toward his tendency to 
overthrow receivers. 
</P>
<P>
"He has to be pointedly brought to task," Henning said. "But I'm still 
supportive of Billy. I think that Billy has come a long way and is going to be 
a good quarterback. And I think you can win with Billy. But we're not going to 
win with Billy if he continues to make those kind of decisions and those type 
of throws (that lead to interceptions). 
</P>
<P>
"The six months between now and training camp is important to let Billy know, 
and to let everybody else know, if we can find somebody who can be more 
consistent, then he won't have that job." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-4, 209-pound Friesz, who set 24 school records at the University of 
Idaho, was a sixth-round selection of the Chargers in the draft. He came up 
with a mysterious shoulder injury at the conclusion of training camp, which 
allowed the Chargers to carry him on injured reserve and then eventually in a 
practice capacity. 
</P>
<P>
While Henning has favored Tolliver, General Manager Bobby Beathard has liked 
what he has seen of Friesz in his work as scout team quarterback. Noticeably 
missing in the Chargers' thinking has been Mark Vlasic, who opened the season 
as the team's starting quarterback against Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"If John doesn't play very well then maybe they'll understand it's not all 
Billy's fault," Henning said. "This isn't an easy job. I think the team has 
confidence in Billy, but Billy can't overthrow the ball in the middle. If he's 
not capable of doing that, it's going to be hard for him to remain at the top 
of the list. 
</P>
<P>
"In deciding to move John Friesz up, he has some natural talents we've seen. He 
seems to be a little bit more naturally accurate than Billy, although we have 
to find out if he has the resiliency and the strong arm when the pressure's on. 
We have to find out if he can handle the pressure of the position." 
</P>
<P>
Friesz, who expected to go quietly into the off-season without playing a down 
this season, accepted Monday's news with a promise to spend his Christmas 
working overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"It came as a total surprise to me," Friesz said. "Obviously I haven't taken 
any reps since the preseason, so it will be a tremendous challenge for me. But 
I think that's when good players can excel the best. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gotten a call from Billy Joe, and him being the class act that he is, he 
said that he is 100% behind me."

Coach Dan Henning said he doesn't expect running back Marion Butts, who has a 
sore foot, to play against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have an inclination now to play Butts for the rest of our season," 
Henning said. "But he was picked for the Pro Bowl and there are some concerns 
there. We're going to have to deal with Marion and the doctors to make sure we 
don't enthusiastic about playing in the Pro Bowl and get him hurt in the Pro 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"To take that risk now with Marion, I don't think is the way to go. I wouldn't 
rule him out 100%, but I would list him as doubtful." 
</P>
<P>
Butts, who missed last week's game, no longer leads the NFL in rushing. 
Buffalo's Thurman Thomas has rushed for 1,297 yards, while Butts has 1,225 
yards. Detroit's Barry Sanders has 1,281 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Henning said the Chargers will probably have to sign a defensive lineman to 
fill the gap left by the injury to Burt Grossman. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman broke two ribs Sunday against the Chiefs and is not expected to play 
against the Raiders. The team placed nose tackle Les Miller on injured reserve 
with a back injury last week, and has been playing without nose tackle Joe 
Phillips, who remains away from the team because of a salary dispute. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the decision to start John Friesz in place of Billy Joe Tolliver at 
quarterback, Henning was asked if he might open himself to criticism from 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
If the Chiefs defeat Chicago Saturday, they will have a chance to win the AFC 
West Division crown if the Chargers beat the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not concerned about Kansas City or the Raiders; I'm concerned about the 
Chargers," Henning said. "If the arguable point from outside sources is that 
Billy cost us the game Sunday, then maybe they'd be just as happy if we played 
the other guy." T.J. SIMERS

Germ Warfare Alert Issued: The federal government wants to know if U.S. 
companies making viruses or bacteria that could be used in germ warfare get any 
unusual requests or evasive answers from prospective foreign buyers. These 
companies "should be alert to . . . approaches by nationals of countries of 
concern (e.g. Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Libya) to enroll as students or to be 
engaged as research workers in courses or projects involving such technical 
data," the Commerce Department advised. 
</P>
<P>
It urged special caution when prospective buyers offer unusually generous 
payments for advice, lie in their answers, ask for unusually strict 
confidentiality or appear to have military links. A notice, published in the 
Federal Register last week, asks companies to call the Commerce Department if 
they run into one of these situations.

Chrysler Speeds Up Payments: Chrysler Corp. said it had made stock awards and 
incentive payments to about 2,000 executives ahead of schedule because of 
federal income tax changes that take effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The payments were made last week and include one-time stock awards to 
executives and incentive payments associated with a $1-billion cost-cutting 
program, Chrysler spokesman Steven Harris said. The payments stemmed from a 
"bet-your-check" program set up in July, 1989, in which Chrysler executives 
could wager up to 10% of their salaries on meeting the cost-cutting goals, 
doubling their money if successful. Harris declined to reveal the amount of the 
payments.

Shops Defy Sunday Trading Ban: Hundreds of stores in England and Wales opened 
in defiance of Sunday trading laws, taking advantage of one of the last two 
shopping days before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
The open violations of the law, in some cases advertised in the newspapers, 
followed similar openings last week. For the large stores, drawing thousands of 
customers, the fines levied against them are not a hardship. Some managers 
reported "absolutely fantastic" business, the shop workers' union said it 
wasn't fair to the staffs, and the Keep Sunday Special campaign said people 
were complaining that the shop openings disrupted family life.

Tobacco Firm Won't Appeal Ruling: Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Co. said it 
will not appeal a New Jersey Supreme Court decision that health warnings on 
cigarette packs do not protect tobacco companies from liability suits. 
</P>
<P>
Louisville, Ky.-based Brown &amp; Williamson said it is confident it would win 
if any liability cases are presented and would not ask the U.S. Supreme Court 
to review the New Jersey decision. The New Jersey ruling flew in the face of a 
series of federal decisions that gave tobacco companies immunity from 
smoker-death lawsuits after 1966, when Congress ordered the labels placed on 
cigarette packs.

OFFBEAT SUISSA AD AGENCY TO STRETCH ITS CREATIVE BOUNDARIES TO INCLUDE TV SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ad agencies usually produce 30-second commercials -- not 30-minute TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
But don't tell that to David Suissa. The Santa Monica adman has plans to turn 
his advertising know-how into television show-how. 
</P>
<P>
The offbeat ad firm he founded six years ago, Suissa &amp; Associates, has 
formed a subsidiary that will use the talents of the same employees who now 
create ads for such gambling resorts as the Tropicana in Las Vegas and Harvey's 
in Lake Tahoe to develop ideas for TV shows and feature films. These aren't 
half-hour "info-mercials" either, but honest-to-gosh TV shows. "Creativity has 
no boundaries," said the 34-year-old Suissa, whose agency has 21 employees and 
posts annual billings of about $20 million. "If we can be creative in 30 
seconds, who says we can't be creative in 30 minutes?" 
</P>
<P>
Back in the 1950s, it was common for agencies to package television shows for 
advertisers -- such as teaming Bob Hope's show with Texaco. Over the years, 
advertisers, such as Hallmark and Procter &amp; Gamble, have also developed 
their own shows. And many ad executives have independently crafted ideas for TV 
shows and movies, such as Philip B. Dusenberry, chairman of the New York office 
of BBDO Worldwide, who co-wrote the screenplay for "The Natural." 
</P>
<P>
But it is highly unusual for an ad agency to establish a division whose sole 
purpose is to develop original concepts for television and cinema. With the ad 
industry deep in a recession, agencies are seeking new ways to grow. 
</P>
<P>
The question is: What do ad agencies know about the art of developing shows? 
</P>
<P>
Probably as much as anyone, says one production company chief. "Television is 
an execution-driven medium," said Peter Roth, president of Stephen J. Cannell 
Productions, which produces "Wiseguy" and "21 Jump Street." "It doesn't really 
matter who the company is that's behind a show. What matters are the writers, 
actors and producers who execute it." 
</P>
<P>
Advertising executives have mixed opinions about agencies tackling these areas. 
"A good agency can probably sell a TV show just like it sells a TV commercial," 
said Mel Newhoff, senior vice president at the Los Angeles office of the agency 
Bozell. "Also, an agency may have a leg up because it at least understands how 
to develop ideas that sell." 
</P>
<P>
But another top ad executive says the idea isn't new -- and will probably go 
nowhere. "Just like every waiter in Hollywood has a script, so does every 
advertising copywriter," said Gene Cameron, president of the Los Angeles office 
of BBDO Worldwide. "Their clients might wonder: Why aren't they creating ads 
instead of TV shows?" 
</P>
<P>
Suissa notes that creating ads for clients will always come first. Suissa -- 
and several other employees -- work on their program concepts during evening 
hours and on weekends. "Besides," said Suissa, "anything that stretches our 
creativity will help our clients." 
</P>
<P>
It's a sort of formalized hobby, said Mike Indgin, 26, the agency copy chief 
who is also an executive producer in the agency's new division, Suissa 
Productions. "We have this for a hobby kind of like Bo Jackson has football for 
a hobby." 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we watch TV, it's research for us," added Jonathan Fong, 29, an 
agency copywriter who helped launch the new division. Besides pitching ideas 
for shows, the group also creates print ads for the shows, which they then 
display to interested network executives. 
</P>
<P>
The crew has developed a new TV game show concept about eating called "Food, 
Fun &amp; Fortune." The questions all focus on food. "It's a game show that can 
help people lose weight," said Suissa, who has teamed up with Smith-Hemion 
Productions on the project. They have already pitched the show to one major 
network -- and another also has shown some interest. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also is pitching a concept for a 60-minute TV drama, "Venice Beach," 
about a one-legged Vietnam veteran who opens a detective agency on the 
boardwalk in Venice Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still nobody until we get a show on the air," said Suissa. "Our goal, 
God willing, is to have a show on the air by next fall."

MCA Sale Clears Another Hurdle: The Federal Communications Commission said it

to MCA shareholders, removing a barrier to the sale of MCA to Matsushita 
Electric Industrial Co. of Japan. Under federal law, Matsushita as a foreign

Carolco Says It Is Innocent: Independent movie maker Carolco Pictures Inc., 
trying to regain credibility after its chairman was slapped with a court order 
limiting his operating abilities, denied that it had done anything wrong. Los 
Angeles-based Carolco, which released "Total Recall" and "Jacob's Ladder" this 
year, also said the court order would have no effect on its operations. The 
order, issued last week in Los Angeles Superior Court, froze 2.2 million 
Carolco shares owned by Mario Kassar and told the company not to approve any 
loans or financial transactions with Kassar without court approval.

PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWS SHARP SLIDE IN MERGERS IN '90

Merger and acquisition activity on Wall Street plunged this year from 1989 
levels, with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. emerging as the top adviser of the 
lucrative deals, according to a preliminary survey released Monday by 
Securities Data Co. 
</P>
<P>
The total value of all completed deals for 1990 was about $412.5 billion, down 
sharply from $515.8 billion in 1989, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 figures are preliminary, Securities Data said. 
</P>
<P>
The research company said about 7,131 deals were completed in 1990, down from 
7,630 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman was the choice adviser, winning the most number of deals -- 152 -- and 
the highest dollar value -- $47.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Morgan Stanley was the top-ranking adviser in terms of the value of 
the deals, totaling $121.1 billion, while First Boston advised the highest 
number of deals at 200. 
</P>
<P>
Goldman lead the pack this year despite not being principally involved in the 
$11.65 billion merger of Warner Communications Inc. and Time Inc. into Time 
Warner Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing Goldman, based on the total value of deals, were Lazard Freres, Morgan 
Stanley, Lehman Bros., First Boston, Merrill Lynch, Salomon Bros. and 
Wasserstein Perella. 
</P>
<P>
Lehman was the No. 2 adviser in the number of deals at 127, followed by Morgan 
Stanley with 104, and First Boston, Merrill, and Schroeders PLC, which tied 
with 101.

WINE WITH A PHONY PEDIGREE PROMPTS FEDERAL INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The wine bore the proud label of 1986 Montrachet from Domaine de la 
Romanee-Conti, one of the world's rarest and -- at $350 a bottle -- most 
expensive vintages. About five cases, more than $20,000 worth, were sold to a 
Japanese buyer by a Southern California wine dealer. 
</P>
<P>
But the deal went sour after the wine's pedigree proved phony, and the sale has 
prompted a federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Daniels of Wilson-Daniels Ltd. in St. Helena, Calif., official importer of 
Domaine de la Romanee-Conti wines, said the bogus wine carried a label saying, 
"Appellation Romanee-Conti Controlee," a designation that may appear only on 
red wine. But the Montrachet is white. 
</P>
<P>
That detail aside, the label was a respectable fraud, said Daniels, who 
examined a faxed copy of it. "If you just glanced at it," he said, "it looked 
real." 
</P>
<P>
Daniels said he was told that the buyer's money was refunded after he 
complained about the label. 
</P>
<P>
Deepening the mystery, Daniels added, the buyer said he shipped the wine back 
to the merchant, but it "disappeared somewhere between Japan and Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, a branch of the 
Treasury Department, confirmed the probe but would identify neither buyer nor 
seller.

Stocks fell Monday in the slowest session in four years, as pre-Christmas 
trading was dominated by fears about the tension in the Persian Gulf and Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index fell 12.37 to close at 2,621.29. Declining 
shares led advances 862 to 511 on paltry New York Stock Exchange volume of 57.2 
million shares, compared to 233.4 million Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The session, shortened by two hours for the holiday, was the slowest since 48.9 
million shares changed hands Dec. 26, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp losses on the bond market also discouraged stock investors. 
</P>
<P>
Comments over the weekend from U.S. and Iraqi officials heightened concerns 
about a possible Persian Gulf war. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said in an interview with Spanish television 
that Tel Aviv would be his first target if war broke out. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that Iraq showed no sign of 
planning to withdraw from Kuwait and that the clock was ticking toward war. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze last week has 
also raised concerns about the Soviet Union's political stability. 
</P>
<P>
"All this talk is making people nervous," said Ladenburg Thalmann's Richard 
Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the combination of worry about a revolution in Russia and (concerns about 
the) Mideast," said Phil Roth, chief technical analyst at Dean Witter. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the factors here is the small attendance," said Gene Jay Seagle, 
Gruntal &amp; Co.'s director of research. "It's a lack of buying rather than a 
lot of selling." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some analysts believe that stock prices could stage a rally after 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually see a Santa Claus rally in the last four days of the old year and 
first two of the New Year," Larry Wachtel at Prudential-Bache Securities said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Manufacturers Hanover topped the most active list, off 1/8 at 23 7/8. Monday 
was the last trading day that investors could qualify for the company's next 
dividend. 
</P>
<P>
* Several utilities were actively traded. Southern New England Telephone was 
off 3/8 to 33 1/8, and Commonwealth Edison was up 1/8 at 34 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Chiron Corp. was up 1/2 to 41 3/4. An anti-AIDS vaccine, developed by a joint 
venture of Chiron and Ciba-Geigy, will be tested on humans beginning in the 
next few days. 
</P>
<P>
* Smith Barney repeated a buy on Halliburton. The oil services firm said it 
believes that most of an Internal Revenue Service claim against it is without 
merit. Halliburton rose 1/4 to 44. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the British stock market closed early for the Christmas break after 
what dealers described as an extremely quiet session. The Financial Times-Stock 
Exchange 100 index finished 8.1 points lower at 2,156.3. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German stock exchanges were closed Monday for the Christmas 
holiday period. Trading will resume Thursday.

Talk of War Sends Bond Prices Down 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell in thin pre-holiday trading Monday on pessimism over 
heightened Middle East war talk. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond dropped 25/32 point, or $7.81 per $1,000 
in face amount. Its yield rose to 8.35% from 8.29% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said increasing war talk over the weekend from U.S. and Iraqi 
officials sent down the price of the key bond at the start of trading. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was extremely light in an abbreviated trading session. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
trading at 7%, down from 7.25% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Stronger in Active Trading 
</P>
<P>
The dollar strengthened broadly in surprisingly active trading Monday as 
traders sought a safe haven from heightened volatility in the Persian Gulf and 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Gold rose in London and Hong Kong. New York precious metals markets were closed 
in observance of Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar moved sharply higher in New York early in the day, particularly 
against the German mark and the British pound. Those gains were largely 
sustained, though trading tapered off before the currency markets closed for 
the holiday in the early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar rose to a closing 1.5453 German marks from late 
Friday's 1.5289. Earlier, in London, the dollar advanced to 1.5390 German 
marks, up from 1.5295 marks late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The British pound weakened in New York to $1.8685 from $1.8860 late Friday. In 
London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8740, compared to $1.8835 late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose in New York to a closing 136.00 yen from late Friday's 135.50. 
In London, the dollar was quoted at 135.70 yen, unchanged from the close in 
Tokyo on Friday. Japanese exchanges were closed Monday for the Emperor's 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Wheat Prices Rise on Weather Damage 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures prices rose moderately Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a 
late rally linked to new export sales and fears of weather damage to the winter 
wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
Oat futures also advanced, while corn and soybean futures ended mostly lower on 
light volume in a shortened Christmas Eve trading session. 
</P>
<P>
Most cattle futures rose, and pork futures finished mostly lower in a shortened 
session on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Other U.S. commodity markets were 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures settled 1 3/4 to 5 cents higher, with the contract for delivery 
in March at $2.64 1/4 a bushel; corn was 1 1/4 cents lower to 1/2 cent higher, 
with March at $2.33 1/4 a bushel; oats were 1/2 cent to 1 1/4 cents higher, 
with March at $1.12 1/2 a bushel, and soybeans were 1 3/4 cents lower to 1 1/4 
cents higher, with January at $5.62 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat futures drew some support from news of government-subsidized sales of 
U.S. wheat to Colombia, Yemen and Sri Lanka, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The rally also reflected speculation about possible damage to the winter wheat 
crop after nearly a week of record-breaking frigid weather in the Great Plains, 
said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain trading 
division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.

MARKETING: MIDEAST CRISIS HAS SOME MILITARY AD PLANNERS REVISING THEIR 
STRATEGIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Armed Forces officials were not amused when they recently heard the joke 
that their ad slogan, "Opportunity is Waiting for You," was being updated to a 
more timely "Opportunity is Kuwaiting for You." 
</P>
<P>
In light of the Persian Gulf crisis, however, the U.S. Armed Forces did react 
relatively quickly this month and revamp its slogan to read: "Stand up, stand 
out." 
</P>
<P>
"When there's the possibility of a shooting war," said Robert Ravitz, executive 
vice president at Grey Advertising in New York, which creates Armed Forces ads, 
"you don't want to mislead someone into thinking that if they join, they still 
get to travel and see the world." 
</P>
<P>
But that kind of thinking is hardly unanimous among the various branches of the 
military, which together spent more than $65 million on advertising last year. 
Officials for the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines generally say they have no 
plans -- at least right now -- to change their individual advertising 
strategies. Most of the current campaigns talk about the character-building and 
job-training benefits of each military branch. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is certainly aware of what is going on in the Middle East," said John 
Glorieux, general manager of the New York agency Young &amp; Rubicam, which 
creates ads for the Army. "They don't need advertising to remind them." 
</P>
<P>
With the United Nations' Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to remove all of its troops 
from Kuwait approaching, tensions in the Middle East continue to escalate. That 
has put pressure on the various branches of the Armed Forces to attract new 
recruits at a time when the numbers of those signing up are generally 
dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
The problem confounding them all: how to patriotically convince potential 
recruits that war isn't really hell. Well, even Madison Avenue probably can't 
accomplish that. So, most branches of the Armed Forces say they won't even try. 
Instead, they will continue to market themselves as a gold mine of job training 
and college funds. 
</P>
<P>
But by doing that, several advertising and marketing experts say, the 
individual branches of the military are probably conveying the wrong messages 
and perhaps even misleading potential recruits. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to boost enrollment, advertising things like the opportunity to 
see the world is not the way to get it," said Bernd Schmitt, a consumer 
behavior specialist at Columbia University in New York. "The part of the world 
you'd want to see is probably not where you'd be sent right now." 
</P>
<P>
With the current Middle East tensions, "my gut tells me that recruits won't buy 
in as quickly to those career-in-a-can claims," said Brent Bouchez, creative 
director at the Los Angeles office of Ketchum Advertising. "If they want people 
to sign up, they'll have to change the way they talk." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the Persian Gulf has such "top of the mind awareness," said Joel 
Stekel, a marketing professor at New York University, that "you can't really 
avoid it in recruitment advertising." What's more, he said, ads that right now 
try to appeal to recruits who want to "camp, fly and swim" are probably 
downright silly. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to be sensitive to what's going on in the world," said Grey's 
Ravitz, whose Armed Forces ads appeared in recent issues of People, Parade and 
TV Guide. "It didn't seem appropriate to talk about other benefits in the 
equation when, in all practicalities, you could end up in a bunker in the 
Persian Gulf." 
</P>
<P>
Besides replacing its old slogan, the visuals in its new ads have also been 
drastically changed from pictures of soldiers in action to more patriotic 
illustrations of the American eagle. The new ads say, "Protecting freedom takes 
hard work. Dedication. And sometimes sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
The point of military advertising is to attract recruits. Although the number 
of Navy recruits fell in October and November, the jingle, "You and the Navy . 
. . full speed ahead," won't be changed, said Cmdr. Mel Sudin, public affairs 
officer at the Navy Recruiting Command in Washington. "We're not at a point yet 
where we have to consider any drastic changes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nor will the message "The few. The proud. The Marines," be changed, said Maj. 
Robert Wilson, head of marketing for the U.S. Marine Corps. "Even if war breaks 
out, we won't change," Wilson said. "We've always sold ourselves as being the 
first to fight." 
</P>
<P>
But if war breaks out, the U.S. Army would reduce its advertising 
significantly, said Col. John Myers, director of advertising for the U.S. Army 
Recruiting Command in Ft. Sheridan, Ill. "It would be insensitive to run an 
Army message about college funding that could be juxtaposed next to news 
footage of combat casualties." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Reaction to Luxury Ads in Homeless Story 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes ads can pop up in the most awkward places. 
</P>
<P>
Take the Dec. 17 issue of Time magazine, which had a five-page spread on the 
plight of the homeless. Among other things, the story was accompanied by a 
half-page photo of a homeless person living in a cardboard box. But weaved 
between the pages of the article, in about one-fourth of the magazine's 4 
million issues, were full-page ads for some of America's priciest products. 
</P>
<P>
One ad was for a Parker pen that sells for $300. Another was for Jaguar cars -- 
"Classic luxury that makes time stand still." Yet another, with French skier 
Jean Claude Killy, was for Rolex watches. "In life as in skiing," the ad says, 
"timing is everything." 
</P>
<P>
And what about "timing" in advertising? Well, a Time spokesman said the 
magazine received no complaints about the juxtaposition of the ads and the 
editorial. "We don't feel it's a problem," said spokesman Robert Pondiscio. 
"It's wrong to assume people who buy expensive things don't care about 
homelessness." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
L.A. Hires 4 Firms to Plan Recycling Ad Blitz 
</P>
<P>
Get ready for an onslaught of recycling ads and promotions in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Los Angeles City Council voted to spend $3.2 million on 
an advertising and public relations campaign to get the word out about the 
city's new recycling program. The funds will be spread among four ad and PR 
firms -- with about half of the money going to Westwood-based Laufer 
Associates, which specializes in social and environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles office of Foot, Cone &amp; Belding will be responsible for the 
mainstream advertising and direct-mail part of the campaign. Coronado 
Communications will oversee promotions in the Latino and Asian communities, and 
Lois Hill Hale &amp; Associates will handle outreach to the city's 
African-American community. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the recycling program: Reduce non-recycled trash by 50% by the year 
2000. 
</P>

Milli Vanilli Almost Perfect for Dreyer's Ad 
</P>
<P>
Just how silly is Milli Vanilli? 
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, an agent representing Milli Vanilli telephoned the folks at 
Oakland-based Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream about appearing in an ad. The group 
Milli Vanilli was recently stripped of its 1989 Grammy for best new artist when 
it was revealed that the duo didn't sing on their best-selling album. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, Dreyer's has been running an ad campaign featuring 
"unbelievable spokesmen." Past ads featured such "unbelievables" as former 
White House Chief of Staff and convicted felon John Erlichman, and Melvin 
Dumar, the man who claimed that Howard Hughes included him in his will. 
</P>
<P>
So, what about Milli Vanilli? "It would have been a perfect fit," said Dreyer's 
spokeswoman Jennifer Howard. Alas, the ice cream maker recently dumped that 
campaign when it hired a new agency. Too bad. Milli Vanilli would have been a 
dilly. 
</P>

Little S.F. Newspaper on a Meatless Diet 
</P>
<P>
It has become common for certain publications to turn down ads for cigarettes 
and alcohol. But a tiny San Francisco newspaper -- which has relied heavily 
upon local grocery store ads -- has decided to reject all ads for meat, poultry 
and fish products. 
</P>
<P>
Behind this is the publisher of the New Fillmore, a monthly neighborhood paper 
in San Francisco's Pacific Heights district, who says he has become a 
"radicalized" vegetarian. 
</P>
<P>
"The realities about the damage an animal-based diet wreaks upon our health and 
the environment have become too overwhelming for me to ignore," said David Ish, 
publisher of the paper, which has a circulation of 17,500. As a result of this 
policy, two of the paper's largest advertisers -- local grocery stores -- have 
cut way back on their ads. 
</P>
<P>
Ish said the paper will continue to accept ads for "meatless meats" -- made of 
soy products.

ONE EN-CHANTED CHRISTMAS EVE; 
</P>
<P>
AT ST. MICHAEL'S ABBEY, MIDNIGHT MASS IS SUNG IN BOTH LATIN AND GREGORIAN CHANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't talk to the guys at St. Michael's Abbey about the old standards. Don't 
bring up the Cole Porter chestnuts or the Irving Berlin ditties or the Gershwin 
tunes if you want to impress them with your knowledge of music in the old days. 
It won't work. 
</P>
<P>
To the priests and seminarians at the abbey, Mozart might as well have been a 
rapper. They deal each day in music that was new when the Chinese were using 
printing presses for the first time: Gregorian chant. 
</P>
<P>
They sing unto the Lord an old song. 
</P>
<P>
They belong to the small Roman Catholic community of priests known as 
Norbertines, an order founded in France in 1121 by St. Norbert and that 
flourished in later centuries in Hungary. St. Michael's is the headquarters of 
one of only three Norbertine communities in the United States, and it is the 
only Catholic seminary in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
It is also one of the few places you can hear the Mass sung not only in Latin, 
but in Gregorian chant. The performance of chant as part of the liturgy is the 
cornerstone of the Norbertine order. 
</P>
<P>
The priests of the abbey teach at St. Michael's Prep School (which is on the 
grounds of the abbey north of El Toro), as well as at Santa Margarita and Mater 
Dei high schools, and they work at various Orange County parishes on weekends. 
But "our main purpose is to sing the liturgy -- what we call the divine 
office," said Father Philip Smith, the abbey's music director. 
</P>
<P>
"The liturgy is the focal point of our lives, and Christmas is the 
personification of that because we have a beautiful midnight Mass preceded by 
Christmas carols and midnight Matins." 
</P>
<P>
Word gets around. The abbey's church routinely is filled to capacity for the 
midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. People from throughout the county come to hear 
the choir of 20 seminarians sing the ancient unison songs developed by Pope 
Gregory I in the 6th Century. For most of the seminarians, that night is about 
as close to show business as they'll get. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a bit of show biz," said Darrin Merlino, a postulant, or begining 
seminary student, from Huntington Beach. "For some reason, we always seem to 
sound better when there's a group out there watching us. But overall, it's 
pointed toward Christ. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really did anything musically before I came here, and it's exciting 
being an active member and singing rather than just listening. You really get a 
feel for the music and you become part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Although all Norbertines sing, few have had formal musical training, Smith 
said. Seminarians may never have sung in a choir or learned to read music 
before coming to St. Michael's, "but we give them plenty of experience once 
they get here," he added. 
</P>
<P>
At the abbey, not only do they learn to read music, but they master the 
complexities of the ancient "square notation" used in Gregorian chant, in which 
the musical note heads are square-shaped rather than oval and have no stems to 
indicate rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
"I was mostly used to guitar Masses before coming here, and that just didn't 
appeal to me," said Frater Justin Ramos (the designation is Latin for brother), 
a seminarian from Los Angeles. "When I first heard Gregorian chant, it really 
stirred me. I had learned the notation, and when I came here that was made 
alive for me. That drew me. They place such a great emphasis on it here. It 
really inspired me to want to learn it more." 
</P>
<P>
Romy Kirchhoefer, a postulant from Salt Lake City, said he came to the abbey 
for a Palm Sunday Mass before entering St. Michael's Prep School, "and they 
were playing the Gregorian chant through the speakers outside. That was the 
first time I'd heard it, really, outside of maybe an old movie somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really a powerful factor in my wanting to join the community because I 
thought that it was really beautiful. I liked the way people were wearing the 
white habit and that they were in a religious community, but I think the 
Gregorian chant was really the determinant for me." 
</P>
<P>
Kirchhoefer, Ramos and a handful of other seminarians have learned enough of 
the chant and of the more familiar polyphonic music -- which employs harmony -- 
to qualify for the abbey's polyphonic schola. This is a smaller choir that 
sings four-part pieces daily in rehearsal and performs traditional Christmas 
carols in parts beginning on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the cream of the musical crop at St. Michael's," said Smith, who has a 
bachelor's degree in music education from Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The sound produced by both choirs was striking enough to get the attention of 
John and Deborah Traylor, record producers from Huntington Beach. They arranged 
for the choirs to record a compact disc of Christmas songs and chants last 
December. The disc was released in Southern California in October. 
</P>
<P>
The songs and chants on the recording don't show the polish of a professional 
choir, but they weren't meant to, Smith noted. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't learn any music specifically for the recording," he said. "We said, 
'OK, we've sung the midnight Mass, now we're going to document it.' We wanted 
as much as possible to have it sound just as it sounds when people come to 
midnight Mass here. We did not want it to be too polished. We did not want a 
studio sound. We wanted people to be able to hear in their homes what it's like 
to come to midnight Mass at St. Michael's." 
</P>
<P>
In dealing with Gregorian chant, he said, "the true professionals are not 
necessarily the ones with (musical) expertise because Gregorian chant embodies 
a centuries-old tradition of worship. The true professionals in that kind of 
music are the ones who have dedicated their lives to living out that 
tradition." 
</P>
<P>
For the seminarians and priests of St. Michael's, working as a choir is an 
outgrowth of a communal life unique to Orange County. Most priests in the 
county are of the diocesan, or parish, variety and live in small numbers in 
rectories near their churches. The Norbertines are priests of the type known as 
religious, and most of them live together in a specific location dedicated 
specifically to their community: the abbey. 
</P>
<P>
The community of Norbertine priests that would eventually live at the abbey 
began when a small group of Hungarian Norbertines established the seminary on 
El Toro Road in 1961. Five years later, the prep school began to accept 
non-seminarian students as boarders. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, the community was given full abbey status by the Vatican, a step that 
indicates the church hierarchy "feels that you have a community that is going 
to be around permanently," Smith explained. "It kind of shows that you have 
become self-sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
Young men studying to be priests at St. Michael's begin as postulants and 
attend classes at Saddleback College for at least two years if they have had no 
previous college training. If they and the priests at the abbey decide they are 
ready to continue their studies, they go on to live at the abbey as novices and 
study theology and philosophy there for two years. Their final studies before 
being ordained are completed in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
The priests take the common vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, but for 
the Norbertines there is another, lesser vow: stability. They promise to remain 
with the community at the abbey. This powerful sense of community is one of the 
main reasons several of the seminarians said they decided to study with the 
Norbertines. 
</P>
<P>
"A priest friend of mine who is at a parish in Costa Mesa told me that at one 
time in his life, he desired the community life because he said that life in 
the rectory, as ironic as it seems, is very lonely," Kirchhoefer said. There 
are only a small handful of priests who live at each parish, he said, but "in 
the community life, you have tens of people going through the same things, the 
same troubles, the same joys and everything is much more like a family." 
</P>
<P>
That family used to be much more isolated. When ground was broken on the 35 
acres where the abbey now sits, the hillside was "nothing but rocks," Smith 
said. Years before widespread development worked its way north on El Toro Road, 
the abbey was a kind of quiet, isolated oasis among the scrub brush. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the grounds are covered with a lush variety of trees and flowering 
plants (planted and tended by the priests and seminarians), and quiet and 
tranquillity still surround the place. But on the facing hillside, across El 
Toro Road, a large housing tract has sprung up. It has produced mixed feelings 
in the religious community. 
</P>
<P>
"When the first founding fathers came here from Hungary," Kirchhoefer said, 
"the only thing here was Cook's Corner, a popular hangout for motorcycle clubs, 
and it was relatively quiet. I think most of us like that because it sets the 
ambience for our spiritual life, and also for our prayer life and our studies. 
We get enough (of life outside the abbey) when we go out to work at the 
parishes. We just want to come back and just be quiet. But the ambience now has 
changed considerably." 
</P>
<P>
But, said Frater Xavier Cloney, a seminarian from West Covina, another priest 
at the abbey put the concept of isolation into a different perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"One time I complained to the principal of the school here that we were getting 
surrounded, and he told me that we didn't come here to get away from people. 
Now, he said, they were coming to us. Our intention was to have just enough 
land for a high school and an abbey." 
</P>
<P>
Said Kirchhoefer: "I didn't come here for the hills. I came here for the life 
and for the spirituality." 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, for the music, particularly at Christmastime. But, unlike the 
commercial world, the Norbertines never jump the gun on holiday celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Christmas really begins for us right on Christmas Day," Ramos said. "The 
time before that, for us, is a time of waiting and expectation, waiting for our 
Lord. Midnight Mass is really the climax. And everything remains for two or 
three weeks after Christmas, but our decorations -- the trees, the lighted 
candles and so forth -- don't go up until Christmas Eve." 
</P>
<P>
But, Smith added, Christmas carols and chant are heard weeks before the 
decorations arrive. Like all other seasonal singers, the Norbertines must start 
rehearsing "Angels We Have Heard On High" and "Silent Night" in November. And, 
if a few clinkers work their way into the music during the Christmas Masses, 
well, the priests are in the business of forgiving. 
</P>
<P>
"As a musician, there were a lot of things I would have liked to have cleaned 
up (in the recording)," Smith said. "But as a priest and a Norbertine, I 
wouldn't want to dabble with it one bit, because this is from their hearts."

"I want my kids to be all-around great," says Steve Marsden, whose third son is 
just over a week old. 
</P>
<P>
Marsden and his wife, Elaine, are typical parents. They want their children to 
do all the right things at the right time and be successful in school. But, 
unlike most parents, the Marsdens are receiving the attention of the local 
school district even before their preschoolers enter kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
As voluntary participants in a program called Parents as Teachers (PAT), the 
Marsdens are getting support in their role as their children's first teachers. 
</P>
<P>
PAT is based on research suggesting that the first three years of life are 
essential learning years and that parental involvement is an important 
contributor to a child's success in school. 
</P>
<P>
"We go through our lives getting grades and raises, but there is very little to 
tell parents that they are doing (their job of parenting) well," says Marsha 
Gebhardt, who visits the Marsden home every six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Gebhardt is one of about 1,400 "parent educators" who are trained to work with 
the 53,000 Missouri families participating in the statewide program. Hired by 
the local school districts, these parent educators provide home visits, group 
meetings and annual developmental screening. The screening program monitors 
language and motor development, as well as tests for hearing or vision 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Districts are required by the state to provide this service, but families are 
free to decline the screening aspect of the program, according to Mildred 
Winter, director of the Parents as Teachers National Center in St. Louis and a 
founder of PAT. Records kept by parent educators become part of the child's 
school record. 
</P>
<P>
Home visits take place every month to six weeks, and group meetings are held in 
which parents can get together to discuss problems and insights having to do 
with raising children. 
</P>
<P>
The Marsdens joined the program when Luke, now age 4, was 18 months old. Since 
PAT concentrates on parents with newborn to 3-year-old children, Gebhardt's 
visits to the family now focus on Sam, 20 months, and the newest family member, 
Matthew. 
</P>
<P>
Gebhardt arrives at the Marsdens' middle-class home looking a bit like Santa 
Claus. She has two shopping bags full of homemade toys. Soon after settling on 
the living room floor, she blows up a balloon for Luke and Sam to hit back and 
forth with cardboard bats made from empty paper towel rolls. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gebhardt talks with the parents about adjustments the family is 
facing in response to 10-day-old Matthew's birth. In the course of a one-hour 
visit, they discuss a number of typical child-rearing matters. The most 
frequent concerns include discipline, sleep patterns, eating and toilet 
training, Gebhardt says. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of what I'm doing is counseling and supporting parents in their job," 
says Gebhardt, who has a master's degree in social work and two children of her 
own. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really nice to have somebody say, 'This is normal, it will pass,' " 
Marsden says. 
</P>
<P>
"We get things off our chest with somebody," Marsden says, adding that Gebhardt 
brings good ideas for homemade toys and family activities. 
</P>
<P>
Mildred Winter describes the role of the parent educator as a "listening ear" 
who comes in to help solve parents' problems or concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Parents have an active role to play in the program, Winter says. "They're not 
going to go off and do the ironing while you come in and work with their 
child." 
</P>
<P>
All parent educators have some background in education and must complete a 
34-hour training class. Certification renewal is required annually, with a 
minimum of 20 hours of training each year. 
</P>
<P>
Home visits and parental education programs are cropping up nationwide. But 
Missouri is the only state with a statutory mandate for statewide parent 
education. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the great problems of children in our society is the fact that so many 
of them are lost to view from the time the parent leaves the hospital with the 
baby until the baby shows up in school," says Edward Zigler, a professor of 
psychology at Yale University. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual component of the PAT program is the link between parent education 
and the local school district, Zigler says. "Schools are beginning to see that 
if you really want a child ready for school, you don't wait for them to show up 
at the age of 5," he says. 
</P>
<P>
A pilot project was launched in 1981; more than 300 families in four school 
districts across the state received the services. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of three years, an independent study found that the participating 
youngsters were significantly more advanced than a comparison group in language 
development, intellectual abilities, and social skills. In addition, their 
parents were more knowledgeable about child-rearing than the average parent who 
was not involved with the program. 
</P>
<P>
A follow-up study done when the same group was in first grade showed that the 
participating children maintained their early advantage. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, under the leadership of then-Gov. Christopher Bond, now a U.S. 
senator, the state passed legislation to expand the program to all 543 school 
districts in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
Winter calls the passing of this legislation "unprecedented." 
</P>
<P>
"We're a very conservative state, and the idea of taking children away from the 
home in the early years would not have been an acceptable one in many areas of 
our state," Winter says. In fact, Missouri did not have mandatory kindergarten 
until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Parent participation in the program is voluntary. Ideally, parent educators 
begin working with a new family in the third trimester of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Participants are recruited through hospitals, birthing centers and various 
social service agencies, but word of mouth seems to be the most successful 
recruiter. 
</P>
<P>
The mandated expansion of the program from four sites to 543 diverse school 
districts created controversy even among PAT advocates. 
</P>
<P>
An original consultant and founder severed his ties with the state's program in 
opposition to the rapid expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"I could not see how they could maintain adequate quality the way they were 
headed," says Burton White, director of the Center for Parent Education in 
Newton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"In retrospect, it was really a blessing in disguise," Winter says of the move 
to statewide implementation. "It has given us a chance to test out the program 
with every conceivable population." About 30% of the state population with 
children from birth to 3 years old are now participating in PAT. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is designed to serve parents of all backgrounds and socioeconomic 
status, program administrators make an effort to target "hard-to-reach" 
families. 
</P>
<P>
PAT's budget is $13 million for 1991, up from $2.7 million the first year. The 
districts are required to provide a minimum of five contacts over an 
eight-month period, including three home visits. More than half the state's 
districts provide the same level of contact as the pilot program, Winter said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the parent educators work part time, which allows for flexibility in 
making home visits in the evenings or on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Districts set salaries for parent educators, but the average pay is about $12 
an hour, says Sue Treffeisen, training coordinator at the national center. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's much argument anymore about the value of this program 
for middle-class parents," Zigler says. "The issue that's causing some 
head-scratching is: Is this program effective with inner-city families or rural 
families?" 
</P>
<P>
A "Second Wave Evaluation" is now being conducted to help answer that question. 
Results are expected in December. 
</P>
<P>
According to White, the funding, training and levels of family contact mandated 
by the state law are insufficient to replicate the results of the pilot 
project. He expects the study to show "very little beneficial effect. . . . 
nothing like what happened in the pilot studies." 
</P>
<P>
"A fair number of states have made inquiries about the program through me," 
White says, "and I tell them all the same thing: 'It's a marvelous program if 
you can replicate the pilot." 
</P>
<P>
"I would be amazed if we didn't get positive effects with Parents as Teachers 
in its present form," Zigler counters. He points to many other programs showing 
positive effects from home visitation and parent education. 
</P>
<P>
"Researchers feel you're never really finished fine-tuning and developing," 
Winter says. The mandate to go statewide gave them no choice but to do the best 
they could, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Children and families are having a hard time today in America" and cannot wait 
for the last word of science, Zigler says. 
</P>
<P>
He has spoken out in favor of national legislation to provide $20 million in 
federal seed money for the implementation of new PAT programs and the expansion 
of existing projects. Currently, 81 replications of the program are operating 
in 28 states. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Marsden knows he doesn't want to wait to start teaching his sons about 
the world: "To sit and wait for kindergarten to come is ridiculous," he says. 
"Why not start as soon as we can?"

<P>
Merry Christmas to: 
</P>
<P>
JANE PAULEY: Heck of a year. NBC forced her out of "Today," and the show's been 
a ratings loser ever since. She became America's sweetheart, and repentant NBC 
is bringing her back in her own weekly prime-time series, "Real Life With Jane 
Pauley," starting Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
BOB SAGET: He's the star of two major ABC series, "America's Funniest Home 
Videos" and "Full House," but his name probably draws a blank stare among many 
TV viewers. He's laughing all the way to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
ARSENIO HALL: Lots of heat, little warmth. 
</P>
<P>
HOWARD ROLLINS: After all the troubles, including admitted drug use, a welcome 
comeback, aided by his "In the Heat of the Night" co-star, Carroll O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
THE OAKLAND A's: Swept in four straight by Cincinnati in the World Series, they 
made TV history by helping break the back of CBS, which lost millions in 
revenue from the unplayed games. They should at least send CBS a get-well card. 
</P>
<P>
LARRY KING: OK, the Ed Sullivan-type variety show on NBC bombed -- but, hey, 
the new $8-million-plus contract with cable's Ted Turner (CNN et al) will keep 
a guy warm at night. 
</P>
<P>
THE CAST OF "CHEERS": Especially George Wendt (Norm Peterson). Look, it took 
Ted Danson eight seasons to finally get his Emmy, so maybe next year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
ANDY ROONEY: Live and learn. 
</P>
<P>
JESS MARLOW: Still no reason to believe there's a better TV anchor in Los 
Angeles than this class act of KNBC Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
ROSEANNE BARR: The ultimate Christmas caroler. "Jingle Bells" was meant for 
her. But maybe not "White Christmas." Then again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"MacGYVER": I still don't know anyone who watches it, but they're out there, so 
happy holidays. 
</P>
<P>
WALTER CRONKITE: The former CBS anchor looks better and better in retrospect. 
</P>
<P>
ANDREW DICE CLAY: You remember Andrew Dice Clay. "Saturday Night Live," all the 
fuss. Then a movie, whatever it was called. The last name again is Clay. It's 
spelled C-L-A-Y. Remember? No? Oh. 
</P>
<P>
DANA DELANY: "China Beach" is history, but thanks for the memories. 
</P>
<P>
NBC: The public-service award for "The Big One: The Great Los Angeles 
Earthquake," the most cynical and exploitative TV film of the year. As soon as 
the show aired, NBC stopped its big "educational" campaign about earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
NBC AGAIN: But this time for a real public service -- last week's engrossing 
"Lifestories" special about a TV newsman with AIDS. Notable script by Richard 
Gollance. And a tip of the hat to Vons for hanging in there as a sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
CHARLIE ROSE: The minute he quit 20th Century Fox's "Personalities" series, the 
studio should have offered the high-profile journalist the anchor job of its 
KTTV Channel 11 news, with an eye to a national nightly Fox broadcast. Would he 
have been interested? You bet. And KTTV badly needs a major anchor presence to 
compete. 
</P>
<P>
WENDY RUTLEDGE: She finally got the ax as anchor at KCOP Channel 13, but it was 
she and Tim Malloy -- canned previously -- who gave the station a news image. 
Not heavyweights, but decent news-readers, no worse than most of the others in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
BLAIR BROWN: Pretty soon now -- Jan. 19 -- we'll be getting the final season of 
her "Days and Nights of Molly Dodd" series on Lifetime cable. And we'll learn 
the father of Molly's child, which she'll have before the series ends. 
</P>
<P>
JEFF SAGANSKY: No one could have done more to try to bring back CBS than its 
new entertainment president -- but, really, were "E.A.R.T.H. Force" and "Over 
My Dead Body" better bets than "Beauty and the Beast"? 
</P>
<P>
MICHAEL TUCK: The commentaries of the brash San Diego import have brought some 
badly needed life to KCBS Channel 2's long-dormant 11 p.m. news. Welcome to 
L.A. 
</P>
<P>
DEBORAH NORVILLE: All kinds of rumors that Jane Pauley's controversial "Today" 
replacement might not return to the show after maternity leave. But "Today" 
needs a lot more changes than that. 
</P>
<P>
BILL MOYERS: For heaven's sake, grab that reported CNN opportunity as soon as 
possible. Now a PBS fixture, Moyers -- lest we forget -- was the last truly 
outspoken commentator on the networks' evening news broadcasts when he was at 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
JIM AND TAMMY BAKKER: TV just ain't the same without you. 
</P>
<P>
RICK DEES: It's hard to figure exactly what his late-night ABC show is trying 
to do, but it certainly would be helpful to know. 
</P>
<P>
JACK PAAR: Because he was great. 
</P>
<P>
GLENN CLOSE: Because she's not a snob about TV -- she'll be back on CBS' 
"Hallmark Hall of Fame" again Feb. 3 in "Sarah, Plain and Tall," about a woman 
in 1910 who answers an ad for a wife placed by a widowed farmer. 
</P>
<P>
ROBERT STACK: The "Unsolved Mysteries" host once got a letter from Elizabeth 
Ness, the widow of Eliot Ness, whom he played in TV's "The Untouchables." Mrs. 
Ness wrote that her husband was "an exciting, delightful and very real man," 
and added, "You have done an amazing thing in catching so much that was 
characteristic of him." 
</P>
<P>
CAROL KANE: Wonderfully funny and touching again in "American Dreamer," the 
Robert Urich dramedy that NBC has put on hiatus -- but should really try again 
in a good time slot. 
</P>
<P>
MORTON DOWNEY JR.: First his raunchy syndicated show was dropped. Now NBC's 
cable channel, CNBC, has canceled his more moderate series. Some guys just 
aren't appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
WILL SMITH: The rap image may well have harmed his "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" 
series in the ratings, but with the right property -- TV or movie -- he'll take 
off like a shot. 
</P>
<P>
ANTHONY YERKOVICH: Every time I see a "Miami Vice" rerun on cable, I think of 
his incredible pilot script that created the series. 
</P>
<P>
THE TV ACADEMY: Was it really worth it to trade viewers for cash in that Emmy 
Awards deal that put the show on the low-rated Fox network? 
</P>
<P>
RONALD REAGAN: Here, at last, is the real reason he was a popular TV President: 
He wasn't ashamed to let us see his T-shirt underwear, and he could get away 
with brown suits on major occasions. Everyman. 
</P>
<P>
GARY COLEMAN: A very nice young man who has handled his kidney problem bravely. 
</P>
<P>
JULIE KAVNER: From Valerie Harper's sister on "Rhoda" to a regular role on "The 
Tracey Ullman Show" to the voice of Marge, the mother on "The Simpsons" -- a 
real pro. 
</P>
<P>
PETER FALK: "Columbo" still dresses up TV, a reminder of less tacky days on the 
home screen. 
</P>
<P>
"TWIN PEAKS": Despite all the contortions of the show since its debut, the 
two-hour pilot was one of the great moments in TV history -- a thrilling 
creation. 
</P>
<P>
DAVE DEL DOTTO: King of the infomercials. Look, I'd rather have a guy giving 
people some get-up-and-go with his cash-flow system than those creepy 
televangelists who used to dominate this type of bought-and-paid-for 
programming. I mean, the worst you can do is not get rich. 
</P>
<P>
SHARON GLESS: After years with Tyne Daly in "Cagney &amp; Lacey," she's 
impressively able to hold center stage on her own in "The Trials of Rosie 
O'Neill." 
</P>
<P>
CBS: Because the staggering, once-great network needs every good wish it can 
get.

PARAMOUNT'S EPIC 'GODFATHER III' STRUGGLE; 
</P>
<P>
THE STUDIO'S MANCUSO PUSHES THE FILM TO COMPLETION; 18 COPPOLA SCRIPTS LATER, 
THE $55-MILLION SEQUEL OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
At the end of "The Godfather Part III," which opens in nearly 2,000 theaters 
across the country today, Michael Corleone blows his brains out. 
</P>
<P>
Scratch that. He dies in a diabetic coma. 
</P>
<P>
No wait. He gets shot, then his nephew murders the archbishop . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Well, actually, none of the above occurs at the end of Francis Ford Coppola's 
third entry in the Corleone family saga, but those endings were among many 
written in the 18 versions of the screenplay during the last two years. Two 
versions were filmed. 
</P>
<P>
Even as late as September, Coppola was shooting new scenes that he had just 
completed writing. All that frantic, sometimes chaotic, composition has finally 
been condensed into the two-hour, 41-minute "Godfather III," which arrives 16 
years after the second, Oscar-winning installment, in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The film marks the close of an epic struggle by Paramount Pictures and its 
chief executive, Frank Mancuso, to breathe life into this long-awaited sequel 
to two of the most popular and critically acclaimed movies of all time. 
</P>
<P>
Mancuso and his studio have more than a $55-million production bill and an 
estimated $20-million-plus marketing tab riding on this movie: Their prestige 
is deeply wrapped up in the production. "(The first two 'Godfather' movies) 
were the pinnacles of achievement -- motion pictures that did tremendously 
creatively, as well as being commercial successes," said Mancuso, who had made 
"Godfather III" a top priority of his regime. "You always attempt to achieve 
that combination." 
</P>
<P>
The latest episode brings back some of the original cast -- Al Pacino, Diane 
Keaton, Talia Shire -- in a story about a Corleone family gone "legit" being 
drawn back into the violent underworld by Michael's attempt to take over a 
Vatican-connected conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Garcia plays Vincent Mancini, Michael's nephew and unlikely heir apparent. 
Michael's daughter -- Vincent's lover and first cousin -- is played by 
Coppola's own daughter, Sofia; it's a key performance, originally cast with 
Winona Ryder, that has met with derision from many critics. 
</P>
<P>
This wasn't always the cast or story line for "Godfather III." Not even close. 
Before Coppola and author Mario Puzo got involved, Paramount commissioned 15 
treatments and screenplays by at least nine writers. Even former Paramount 
chief Michael Eisner once tried his hand at writing a story line. 
</P>
<P>
At various times, the movie was to star Sylvester Stallone, John Travolta and 
Eddie Murphy, and Coppola wasn't the only director the studio considered. The 
names of Martin Scorsese, Richard Brooks and Dan Curtis were all mentioned. The 
story's various backdrops included CIA plots, Colombian drug rings and the Las 
Vegas casino scene. Even the original story that Coppola and Mario Puzo 
finished in the spring of 1989 changed markedly over the course of 
pre-production, production and post-production. 
</P>
<P>
The scripts accommodated major cast changes, most notably the loss of Robert 
Duvall's Tom Hagen, the trusted consiglieri of Vito and then Michael Corleone 
in Parts I and II, when Paramount refused to meet Duvall's salary demands. And 
there was Coppola's own frenetic style, his penchant for writing as he goes, 
that caused even some of the new film's fans to lament the muddled complexities 
of the story and to acknowledge that it is far from the level of perfection 
reached by its predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
"Godfather III" is dedicated to Charles Bludhorn, the late chairman of Gulf and 
Western (which owned Paramount), who made the second sequel a kind of guiding 
mantra for the company. "He felt it was a brand name, a valuable asset, that 
you had to do it," said Mancuso. 
</P>
<P>
Mancuso worked in Paramount's distribution department when Parts I and II were 
released and got caught up in Bludhorn's passion for the series. Mancuso was 
along when Bludhorn flew Richard Brooks to Paramount's Dominican Republic 
resort and tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade him to direct the project. 
</P>
<P>
But Paramount's West Coast office made its own attempts. In June, 1977, Michael 
Eisner, then head of the studio, proposed a plot for "Godfather III" involving 
a new Mafia family's offers to aid in a CIA assassination attempt in return for 
drug-trafficking support. Eisner's regime also solicited screenplays -- all of 
them focused on the next generation of the Corleone family. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1978 screenplay by the late Alexander Jacobs (co-writer of "The French 
Connection II"), Michael's son, Anthony, tries to legitimize the empire, but 
his cousin embroils the family in renewed family warfare and a stock fraud 
scheme. That same year, Puzo -- author of the novel that inspired the series, 
and Coppola's co-writer on all three -- wrote a 53-page treatment in which the 
CIA recruits Michael's son to assassinate a Latin-American leader, while 
Michael, posing as a mentally ill recluse, actually runs the family business 
behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Reisner (co-writer, "Play Misty for Me," "Dirty Harry") then wrote a 
treatment that appeared to build on Puzo's work. In his story, Michael is 
killed by a bomb, and an innocent Anthony is drawn inexorably into family 
affairs -- much as Michael was when his father was shot in "Godfather I." The 
son of Sonny Corleone, Michael's hot-headed and doomed older brother in Part I, 
turns out to be the mastermind behind Michael's killing. 
</P>
<P>
An illegitimate son is invented for Michael in a 1982 treatment by Vincent 
Patrick ("The Pope of Greenwich Village," "Family Business"). A big-time Mafia 
don in Sicily, the son returns to the Corleone fold after Michael's death and 
eventually tries to have the sons of both Michael and Sonny killed. Dan Curtis, 
perhaps best known for directing TV's "War and Remembrance" and "Winds of War" 
miniseries, was attached as the director at the time, Patrick said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Bruce Kawin, a University of Colorado professor and author of the book 
"How Movies Work," wrote a treatment for then-Paramount production executive 
Ricardo Mestres, in which Anthony becomes a corrupt senator from Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, Thomas Lee Wright, then a junior Paramount production 
executive, teamed up with former theater owner Nick Marino to write a 
screenplay that explored the near breakdown of the Corleone family, circa 1972. 
Michael -- solidifying his business as a legitimate operation through a real 
estate deal -- becomes the target of both his own family and outside mobsters. 
Connie, grooming her son, Victor, to take over the family, seeks revenge on 
Michael for murdering her husband (in "The Godfather") by masterminding his 
poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
Mancuso, who had become Paramount chief executive the previous year, didn't 
like the Wright-Marino script, telling associates that it de-romanticized the 
Corleones. Mancuso felt Michael should be redeemed in Part III. 
</P>
<P>
Although their script was not produced, Wright and Marino earlier this year 
sought story credits for the final "Godfather III" under the Writers Guild 
arbitration process, claiming that much of the Coppola-Puzo script borrowed 
from their work, particularly from the first act. 
</P>
<P>
Under the union's guidelines, writers must prove that they contributed at least 
one-third of the script in order to receive story credit. Wright and Marino 
argued that there were 55 scenes with significant similarities. They point out 
that they created the Andy Garcia character, Vincent (though he is Sonny's son 
by a different mother in the Coppola script), and they contend that the mobster 
Joey Zaza in the movie is a composite of three characters in their draft. They 
also note that their script, like the movie, explored a tawdry business 
transaction by Michael Corleone as he tries to leave behind the mob and 
solidify his financial holdings as a legitimate businessman. 
</P>
<P>
The guild ruled against Wright and Marino earlier this year, a decision that 
Marino is now challenging in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Mancuso continued the search for a workable "Godfather III" story. He 
told his creative staff that he wanted the plot focused inward, on the family 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things about 'The Godfather' was that there was a real model family 
there at one time," said Mancuso. "How close they were, how supportive they 
were of each other, in contrast to how they operated outside the family. That 
was an important part of this: From the Corleones' point of view, the family is 
often what drives the enterprise. They often think they are acting to protect 
the family from forces outside. . . . Some of these scripts I read along the 
way weren't 'Godfather,' they were nothing more than gangster films." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the past attempts to make a "Godfather III" without the original 
cast and creators, Mancuso refused to give up hope that he could get Coppola on 
board. 
</P>
<P>
"Every once in a while, I would see Francis," Mancuso said, "and I'd always 
bring up the subject. But I noticed that something was very consistent 
throughout: He never said no. He always had some reason why he couldn't do it 
now." 
</P>
<P>
But there were others at the studio who didn't want Coppola to come back, 
principally Paramount production chief Ned Tanen. Apparently, there was bad 
blood between the two, sources said, and Tanen wanted to hire instead the 
respected Russian filmmaker Andrei Konchalovsky. 
</P>
<P>
Still, hoping to spark Coppola's interest, Mancuso in 1987 hired Puzo to write 
a screenplay based on a treatment by former New York Times reporter Nicholas 
Gage. (Gage then rewrote that script.) Much like "Godfather II," the script 
they wrote included flashbacks to the 1930s, when Vito Corleone was building 
his power base, interspliced with contemporary scenes of Michael's battles with 
drug cartels and other Mafia families. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-1988, Mancuso asked Shire, Coppola's sister, to deliver the Puzo-Gage 
script to Coppola at his Napa Valley home. "When I talked to him, he said this 
was wrong and that was wrong," Mancuso said, "and then he started to articulate 
what the story should be, that it should be the personal story of Michael 
Corleone. . . . I said, 'If you think that's what it should be, why don't you 
do it?' " 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Paramount, Coppola at the time needed money. His Zoetrope 
Studios was heading for bankruptcy and he faced a potential $8-million bill 
from one of his lenders, Canadian industrialist Jack Singer. Sources say 
Paramount offered Coppola $6 million, plus a percentage of the receipts to 
direct and co-write the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"I think two things came together" to persuade Coppola to agree to the project, 
said Mancuso. "The fact that, yes, he had money troubles. . . . But also, one 
of the reasons Francis never said no to me all those years was that if 
everything else went wrong for him, 'Godfather III' was something he could 
achieve, create. . . . The one risk he had was that we would do it without him. 
What came together at one time was his understanding of my determination to get 
it done." 
</P>
<P>
Mancuso persuaded Coppola to outline his story, spent $50,000 on a feasibility 
study and, in February, 1989, Coppola and Puzo began writing "Godfather III." 
There is a widespread belief that the pair wrote the first draft in just six 
weeks. Mancuso estimates that it was eight weeks, and Writers Guild records 
obtained by The Times show that the pair submitted their first, 133-page draft 
to the union May 10. 
</P>
<P>
But that, of course, was only the beginning. Before Coppola began shooting in 
November, the pair completed seven scripts, ranging from 113 to 145 pages. (The 
final shooting script was 120 pages.) Even after production began, Coppola held 
true to his reputation for improvising on the set and rewrote the script nine 
more times. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason the movie was released on Christmas instead of at 
Thanksgiving -- as originally planned -- was Winona Ryder's 11th-hour retreat 
from the project due to poor health. But Coppola's tinkering also appears to 
have accounted for some of the delay. In September, the director shot 20 more 
pages of screenplay, including scenes involving the film's stars and the coda 
ending, which the director did use. 
</P>
<P>
Intentionally or not, that ending raises the specter that there might be a 
"Godfather IV," with one of Paramount's favorite rising stars, Garcia, leading 
the Corleone family into the Mafia's rocky future. Whether Mancuso pursues yet 
another sequel largely depends on how much his difficult, 14-year-effort to get 
"Godfather III" to the screen pays off.

CRITIC AT LARGE: MESSAGES OF HOPE, THOUGH FAR BETWEEN 
</P>

Christmas always seems to me to be all the holidays and most of the prominent 
emotions rolled into one. By now it is both religious and secular, by tradition 
and observance respectively, a duality that puts the secularist ACLU in 
contention with both Christians and Jews, although I see that the creche has 
just won a round in Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
The day has all the end-of-year finality of New Year's Eve, all the 
thankfulness of Thanksgiving, including the gathering-in of the family, much of 
the sense of renewal of Easter. And, as on Labor Day, you are mindful of those 
who have to work when so many people don't. 
</P>
<P>
Emotionally, Christmas is what you might call intermittent, with sunshine and 
rain showers contending. December 25 measures the passage of time like no other 
day this side of your birthday. "I was just writing Christmas cards yesterday," 
said the forlorn note on one card, meaning that yesterday was a year ago. At a 
certain point the Dec. 25's go by ever faster, like telephone poles watched 
from an accelerating train. 
</P>
<P>
The joys of the day, even if they are abundant, are always undercut by 
melancholy -- for the friends the dying year has taken with it, for goals not 
achieved, by the thought of the growing millions for whom the joys are not 
abundant, only the pains. Even when they survive, the joys have a hard fight 
with a growing cynicism that attends the getting and spending and general 
exploitation of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's because Christmas is so various a collage, contrastingly light and 
dark, and so personal an experience, that the movies, when you think about it, 
have done so relatively little with it. The exhaustive Leslie Halliwell lists 
fewer than a dozen films with Christmas in the title, plus three "Scrooges" 
further back. Memory rather than lists discloses the 1942 "Holiday Inn," in 
which Bing Crosby introduced "White Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
This year's most memorable use of the Christmas season is undoubtedly in John 
Hughes' "Home Alone," in which the extraordinary Macaulay Culkin is left behind 
at Christmastime, to contend not only with accidental abandonment but with a 
couple of dimwit but malevolent burglars. The Christmas timing is symbolically 
perfect, the film having been a rich gift for the distributor and a present for 
audiences who have made it one of the top hits of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Turning the dial a few nights ago, I lit on one of the classic, recurring 
Christmas films, the 1951 Alastair Sim "Scrooge" done in glorious 
black-and-white. What I saw was a colorized version that seemed to leave the 
characters vaguely greenish, suggesting the way your skin looks when you stand 
under a mercury-vapor street light. But, in black-and-white or a kind of 
diseased sepia, the Dickens tale of sentimental redemption from greed and 
indifference is sure-fire stuff. Christmas is still the most indefatigably 
sentimental of holidays, and cynicism hasn't won a round yet. 
</P>
<P>
The classic American Christmas film is, of course, the Frank Capra-James 
Stewart "It's a Wonderful Life," which appears to run on television even more 
often than Cal Worthington commercials, both in black-and-white, as it should, 
and in pallid color, as it shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
When Frank Capra pitched the plot to Stewart just after the end of World War 
II, Stewart listened to Capra's rather stumbling synopsis (it's not easy to 
summarize, at that) and said, approximately, "Frank, if you want me to play a 
guy whose life is saved because his angel hasn't earned his wings yet, I'm your 
man." 
</P>
<P>
It was a way of saying, "I trust you." And never was an actor's trust better 
placed. The script, by Frances Goodrich, Albert Hackett and Capra himself, is 
the most sentimental of movies and, thanks to Stewart himself, still one of the 
most appealing in its dramatic insistence on the ultimate triumph of good over 
evil, hope over despair and love (of wife, family, town, country, world) 
conquering all. 
</P>
<P>
By rights, in its all-pervading goodness I suppose the film should make our 
teeth ache. But for most of us it doesn't, especially as it grows year by year 
more encrusted with our associations, and our recollections of seeing it in 
other years and different settings. It is still Stewart's favorite among his 
films. 
</P>
<P>
It is an irony that only a few years later Capra decided that the audience, 
presumably hipper, more cynical and sophisticated than before, had had enough 
of his populist optimism, his repeated vision of the ordinary man 
(extraordinary in the clutch) winning against the odds. Capra quit making 
films. Now "Capraesque" has become a selling point for movies that Capra 
himself might or might not have chosen to make, but say that the world can 
still provide happy endings for the Joes and Janes who have struggled for them. 
</P>
<P>
As against only a year ago, this Christmas is heavily shadowed by fears of war 
and the realities of recession. The plight of the homeless is beyond the gift 
of Stewart's guardian angel, Henry Travers, to solve. 
</P>
<P>
A cynic once remarked that an optimist is anyone who thinks the future is 
uncertain. But it is only necessary to hark back to the darkest Christmases of 
one's own life -- observed amid deaths in the family, disastrous financial 
circumstances and the prospect or the fact of other wars -- to realize that one 
of the gifts of Christmas is hope, distant and uncertain as it may seem. 
</P>
<P>
I can do no more than wish us all that gift of hope.

GORBACHEV GETS OK FOR VOTES ON LAND, UNITY PACT

<P>
A testy Mikhail S. Gorbachev, reasserting his leadership in Parliament, won 
backing Monday to launch key referendums on retaining a united Soviet Union and 
on permitting the private ownership of land. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet president also gained the approval, largely symbolic, of the 
Congress of People's Deputies, the national Parliament, for his blueprint to 
reunite the country's restive republics in a renewed union. 
</P>
<P>
But several of the 15 republics are likely to refuse to hold the referendums, 
and the name of that union may differ from that planned by Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
He had proposed to replace the ideological "Socialist" in the "Union of Soviet 
Socialist Republics" with "Sovereign," but the Congress, living up to its 
reputation as a highly conservative body, voted 1,365 to 189 to recommend that 
the old name be retained. 
</P>
<P>
The vote, orchestrated by Congress Chairman Anatoly I. Lukyanov, brought a 
wrathful outburst from Gorbachev, who snapped, "I don't understand why these 
maneuvers are going on here, including by the chairman." 
</P>
<P>
That Gorbachev would lash out at Lukyanov, who has always been a model of loyal 
devotion, reflected the deep trouble in his inner circle, which has already 
been shaken in the past week by Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's 
dramatic resignation and rare criticism from Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev continued in a sharp tone to propose the two referendums, asserting 
his constitutional right as president to introduce legislation. 
</P>
<P>
They passed easily, each garnering only a few dozen "no" votes among the almost 
2,000 deputies. 
</P>
<P>
But deputies did question why a nationwide referendum is required when the 
republics should be able to decide for themselves whether they want to remain 
in the Soviet Union under the terms of a new union treaty. Gorbachev won 
approval on Monday for the outline that will be used as the basis for treaty 
negotiations with the republics. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, as well as the southern 
republic of Georgia, have announced that they want full independence, but the 
vast Slavic heartland and Central Asia appear willing to remain joined -- on 
their own terms. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's response to the deputies was angry: "We are talking about the 
expression of the people's will on the core question of the life of the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Several lawmakers also protested that it is foolish to hold the referendum on 
the country's unity nationwide when it is really only needed in republics that 
are openly seeking secession. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev stuck to his formula that every single citizen of the Soviet 
Union must be asked if he backs "a renewed union as a federation of equal 
Soviet socialist sovereign republics." 
</P>
<P>
In a clear concession to conservatives, he added the word socialist to the 
language of the referendum after the vote on the country's name, saying that 
"the Congress has taken its position and I join it." 
</P>
<P>
Philosophically, Gorbachev argues that the questions on the two referendums are 
so important that the people must be asked directly. 
</P>
<P>
Tactically, however, the referendums allow him to get around the defiant 
parliaments of the country's 15 constituent republics, all of which have 
declared their sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
The question of private land ownership is one of the most divisive in Soviet 
society. Reformists argue that only farmers who own their plots truly care 
about what they produce, while Communist Party hard-liners warn that if land is 
bought and sold, an exploitative landlord class will be created. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has declared himself against the purchase and sale of land. 
</P>
<P>
The parliaments in the Russian Federation and the Baltic republics have already 
approved private ownership, however, and deputies said those republics would 
probably not agree to holding referendums on the question. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Victor Alksnis, a self-described "hawk" from Latvia, told reporters that 
those who observe how easily Gorbachev's proposals passed could be deceived 
into thinking that the Soviet president still enjoys massive support in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, "what is happening at the Congress is starkly different from what is 
happening outside," Alksnis said. "Whereas Mikhail Gorbachev's rating in the 
country as a whole stands at 20%, at the Congress he is, on the contrary, 
supported by 80%." 
</P>
<P>
Polls show that the Congress' attitude toward a new union treaty also differs 
greatly from that of the general public. A bare majority, 52.7% of people 
polled in 23 places around the Soviet Union by the Parliament's polling 
service, said they believe that the Soviet people "are so closely knitted 
together that no division is possible." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's real test is expected to come today or Wednesday when the Congress 
is expected to vote on the president's proposal to expand his executive powers 
under a general reorganization of the government that would create a vice 
presidency and a small cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
Passage would require approval of two-thirds of the Congress' 2,250 members, 
when barely two-thirds have been showing up on typical days since the session 
began a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Alksnis and the powerful Soyuz group of about 400 conservative deputies he 
represents raised another challenge to Gorbachev on Monday with a proposed 
resolution that the lawmakers be actively involved in formulating Soviet policy 
in the Persian Gulf from Jan. 5 through 14, the eve of the deadline for Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein to withdraw his forces from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Any participation by the Soviet Union in military activities against Iraq is 
impermissible, because it contradicts the state interests of the Soviet Union," 
the draft resolution said.

CHRISTMAS SPIRIT KEEPS ON LIVING WITH RENTED TREES; 
</P>
<P>
YULETIDE: ENTREPRENEUR HOPES HIS SERVICE WILL PROVE AN ALTERNATIVE TO PROVIDING 
FODDER FOR COMPOST HEAPS.

Loyd R. Johnson thought it was a shame that perfectly good Christmas trees 
ended up as compost after the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of wondered for years if there was an alternative to buying dead 
trees," he said, referring to the cut trees commonly sold. "If people were 
willing to spend $20 to $25 for a dead tree, would they be willing to spend the 
same to have it living?" 
</P>
<P>
Thus was born Johnson's Christmas-tree rental service, which in this, his first 
year, leased 1,200 live trees throughout the San Diego area. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he made no profit this year because he had to buy each tree he 
rented. But next year, already owning many of the trees he needs, he expects 
his expenses will be far lower and hopes to begin making a good profit. 
</P>
<P>
Customers placed orders by phone and Johnson delivered the trees rooted in 
planters. He will pick them up after the holidays so he can care for them next 
year at his five-acre spread in this rustic community east of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
By next Christmas, the trees should be about a foot taller, making them more 
attractive to people who have homes with high ceilings as well as for office 
buildings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost a lot of business in La Jolla because the trees weren't big enough for 
the high ceilings in the houses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Once the trees get too big to move, Johnson said he will donate them to 
organizations such as the Boy and Girl Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that if his idea catches on, cut Christmas trees may be obsolete 
in three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
Some of his customers already have said they want the same trees next year. 
</P>
<P>
Renee Augustine of La Mesa said that although the tree she rented is not as 
tall as those she usually gets, she is pleased with the idea that she can get 
the same tree a foot taller next year. 
</P>
<P>
Augustine, originally from Ohio, also likes having a Christmas tree that is not 
chopped down. Live trees also drop fewer needles than cut trees. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day I go by the tree at work and I say, 'That tree looks so dry,' and it 
is so brittle and mine is nice and fresh," Augustine said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Johnson, 49, had thought about opening a tree rental business for 
years, his firm was born of personal tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Jennifer Shawn Johnson, 28, died in October, 1988, in a car accident. 
The couple's children, Mikayla, 7, and Philip, 6, survived. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden I found myself being Mr. Mom," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Wanting to spend more time with his children than his job as a tile-setter 
would allow, he decided the time was right to start the business, called Living 
Trees of Alpine. 
</P>
<P>
Response has been positive, Johnson said, adding that if all goes as planned he 
will rent about 5,000 trees next year. He also plans to offer more types of 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
This year he carries Aleppo, Monterey and Italian stone pines, none of which 
are traditional Christmas trees. He hopes to offer Noble and Douglas firs next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Each renter is asked to sign an agreement promising not to put any chemicals on 
the tree and to remove any aluminum icicles before it is returned. 
</P>
<P>
Rental prices range from $20 for a 2-to 3-foot tree to $32 for a 5-to 6-foot 
tree. 
</P>
<P>
"All they have to do is water (them) and they can treat them like any other 
tree," Johnson said. "All they have to do is dress it up."

<P>
The first word of the catastrophe brewing in this former mining town deep in 
the interior came from a band of 50 naked, starving men. 
</P>
<P>
They emerged from the bush one day at an emergency feeding center at Gile, 40 
miles east, unclothed except for strips of tree bark and begging for seeds and 
farm implements. 
</P>
<P>
There are 20,000 of us in Morrua, they told a stunned worker from World Vision 
International, the Monrovia, Calif.-based aid group working to feed refugees 
from the 15-year war between Mozambique's government and the opposition 
Mozambique National Resistance, known as Renamo. 
</P>
<P>
One week later, Joseph DeVries, a World Vision supervisor in the provincial 
capital of Quelimane, touched down with a health coordinator on Morrua's rocky 
landing strip, in the shadow of a glowering mound-shaped mountain. His plane 
was the first to land there in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Morrua was filled with the eerie silence of a community too sick for anything 
but an interminable series of funerals. In a shack near the center of town the 
visitors found a family of seven just returned from its fifth burial. From a 
dark corner came the exhausted moaning of a child. She would be dead of 
starvation by nightfall, they were told. 
</P>
<P>
That night DeVries sent an emergency telex to John Yale, the World Vision chief 
in Maputo, the Mozambican capital. Another 20,000 people had been liberated 
from behind rebel lines, he reported. After years living at a bare subsistence 
level with Renamo rebels, they were now free but more cut off than ever from 
food, seeds and farming tools. They were in danger of perishing, in effect, 
from freedom itself. 
</P>
<P>
Mozambique is like that today: a country of 14.5 million people just emerging 
into the promise of peace and development 15 years after its independence from 
Portugal, but in peril of wasting away before it has a chance to fulfill that 
promise. It is a place where calamity lurks with every daybreak. 
</P>
<P>
Rich in land and minerals, Mozambique is in potentially better shape than such 
other African countries as Sudan and Ethiopia, where poor land and rainfall 
conditions, exacerbated by civil war, have produced repeated famines. 
Mozambique could conceivably grow enough food to feed itself and could raise 
cashews and cotton for export. But virtually no development has occurred here 
in 15 years of independence, mostly because of the same rural insurgency that 
made refugees out of Morrua's people. 
</P>
<P>
The scanty roads that existed in 1975 to serve the country's potentially rich 
farmland are destroyed, the bridges downed or mined. One million Mozambicans 
live as destitute refugees in neighboring countries, and another 2 million to 3 
million are displaced within its borders. 
</P>
<P>
Morrua, once an agricultural and mining center, is a microcosm of Mozambique's 
condition: sitting atop wealth but living in desperation. 
</P>
<P>
World Vision obtained government permission to enter Morrua by air three months 
after it was "liberated" from rebels by an informal army led by a local 
spiritual leader in July. 
</P>
<P>
By early December, two months after the agency began airlifting food and 
emergency provisions for the most seriously malnourished, the death toll at the 
feeding center was down to two or three a day, from 35 at the start. But only 
half of the 500 tons of food needed to feed the general population had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody here has had a full ration of food yet," Yale said one day recently 
during a reconnaissance visit to the district. "There won't be a harvest until 
March or April, and the rains are coming, so soon there won't be any trucks. 
Until then, they're totally dependent on aid." 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 30 the airlift had stopped: There was no more aviation fuel in 
Quelimane; a shipment had arrived that week, but it was unusably contaminated. 
Obtaining more fuel would take another two to three weeks. In the meantime, the 
toll at Morrua would rise sharply again. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Morrua is in better shape than many other communities of so-called 
deslocados, a term for the war-displaced that embraces both refugees who have 
been driven off their land and recuperados, who have spent years in horrific 
conditions in the hands of the cruel and destructive Renamo rebels. For Morrua 
has a usable airstrip and, until recently, regular deliveries of food as well 
as cultivable land in the district. 
</P>
<P>
But for every Morrua there is at least one Mulevala, a district about 40 miles 
distant, where the scale of the human catastrophe remains unknown because it 
still cannot be easily reached by outside assistance. There may be 30,000 
people in Mulevala, which received one emergency food shipment in November by 
armed military convoy; a second delivery was not scheduled for another month 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
Mulevala cannot be served from the air because Renamo sabotaged its airstrip 
with a dozen deep, crosswise trenches. In November, two bush pilots tried to 
land, one of them a Soviet helicopter pilot who said he was fired on and hit 
from the ground. Both vowed never to go back. 
</P>
<P>
Another side of Mozambique's relief dilemma is easy to visualize in Pebane, a 
coastal district about 850 miles north of Maputo that has supported 200,000 war 
refugees. Pebane is little more than beach and sand spits, unsuitable for 
growing anything but a few sorry shoots of cassava. And it is at the end of a 
long relief supply line from the capital, so food deliveries are irregular. 
This summer, no food arrived for two months, threatening the refugees' health. 
</P>
<P>
But in late November, 4,000 tons, or eight times the quantity of grain that 
could be stored in the town or distributed immediately, arrived all at once. 
There were riots at the tiny quay where two lighters and a barge unloaded sacks 
of corn from a steamer anchored in a neighboring estuary. 
</P>
<P>
So officials should be relieved that about 50,000 refugees have already left 
Pebane on their way home to begin cultivating their old land anew. But 
ironically, as more people return to their old homes and land, the strain on 
relief agencies becomes greater. 
</P>
<P>
In that situation, says Nancy Barnes, the United Nations' emergency officer in 
Maputo, "You have to penetrate into localities where the roads have been 
abandoned for years. Operations take longer because most districts have no 
vehicles. People go (home) by foot, but for supplying them we need trucks. The 
resettling process will require phenomenal resources." 
</P>
<P>
Complicating this picture is a new phenomenon afflicting the Third World: donor 
fatigue. The malady was first visible in Ethiopia, when international agencies 
a year or two ago began expressing doubts about continuing emergency food 
donations valued at $350 million a year. Its first major manifestation in 
Mozambique occurred this year, when donor pledges of food aid fell short of the 
government's emergency request by 50%. Only about half of what was pledged, 
furthermore, arrived on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's traditional donors have disappeared -- literally, in the case of 
East Germany, once a key provider of technical help. Now its contribution is 
subsumed in the $25 million a year provided by Germany, one of the smallest 
European bilateral aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union provided almost all of Mozambique's oil under credit terms 
that amounted to giving it away for free. But that country has turned inward, 
trying to staunch its own economic wounds, and Mozambique's oil bill will soar 
this year from zero to $140 million. 
</P>
<P>
There are bright spots. The government recently announced a limited cease-fire 
with Renamo, the first agreement between the two sides on any subject in 15 
years. And a new constitution enshrines the principle of multi-party democracy 
and elements of free-market economy. 
</P>
<P>
So Mozambicans are working more and more on the assumption that the end of the 
civil war is in sight, if only as a distant glimmer. One priority is to rescue 
their children from the effects of three decades of war -- 15 years of 
anti-colonial insurgency followed by another 15 against Renamo -- and 
underdevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
The last decade and a half has encompassed particularly brutal warfare in which 
wholesale kidnapings and torture have been commonly practiced by rebels and by 
armed gangs of "bandits" who may be rebels, army troops or deserters from both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever the war's outcome, we've emasculated generations in terms of 
education, and physically by undernourishment," says Sergio Vieira, director of 
the African Studies Center at Maputo's Mondlane University. 
</P>
<P>
In a small office in Maputo, a team financed by the Save the Children 
Foundation of the United States is assembling posters pasted with a dozen 
grainy black-and-white photographs each. They show Mozambique's orphans, a term 
that encompasses not only children whose parents have been killed but also a 
much larger number who have simply been separated from their families by war. 
</P>
<P>
Abubucar Sultan, director of child programs for the Department of Social 
Welfare, began this family tracing and reunification program in June, 1988, 
when the U.N. Children's Fund estimated there might be more than 200,000 
orphaned or separated children in Mozambique. But others say that number is 
scarcely good enough as even a rough guess. 
</P>
<P>
"No one really knows how many there are," Sultan says. "Day after day people 
are getting kidnaped and separated." 
</P>
<P>
In large part the program is designed to address a continuing psychological 
toll on an entire generation of Mozambican children. Even those granted shelter 
and food in an institutional setting, Sultan believes, suffer severe 
deprivation because no such establishment can offer them the stimulation or 
attention they would get from their families. 
</P>
<P>
"One orphanage I just visited had a capacity of 35 children but had 76 kids 
there, and no staffing," he says. "We don't know the long-term prognosis for 
kids subjected to torture. There are kids who are emotionally troubled, but in 
a school there may be three terms a day, 100 in each class, and the teachers 
can't address these problems. Your best first shot is to put the kids back with 
their families." 
</P>
<P>
That task is slow and involved. Often the young victims have been dispersed far 
from their homes, for when rebel bandits arrived, the entire community 
scattered, the parents escaping on foot and the children, slower, being 
kidnaped. Found or liberated from the rebels, they often do not know and cannot 
even describe where they came from. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's no information, we go with our best hunch as to the kid's language 
group, his ethnic background, etc.," Sultan says. Since the program's start, 
the Department of Social Welfare has documented the origins of 8,000 children 
and reunited 4,000 with family members. 
</P>
<P>
In some districts this amounts to a great victory. One community saw 120 of its 
children reunited with their parents or close relatives in a period of six 
weeks. But Sultan's progress report reflects the feelings of many people like 
him trying to help their country recover from its multiple plagues. 
</P>
<P>
"We've done far less than needs to be done," he says.

GROWERS TAKE STOCK OF LOSSES AS FREEZE WANES

As a slow warming trend took hold across California, agricultural inspectors 
spent Monday in citrus groves, vegetable fields and packing houses trying to 
define the dimensions of the devastation that struck the state's frost-bitten 
agricultural industry over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Most of what they discovered was not encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
In Tulare County alone, where the bulk of California's navel oranges are grown, 
Agricultural Commissioner Lenord Craft was estimating a $200-million loss in 
this year's harvest, which could translate into a $700-million loss for the 
local economy. In Ventura County, destruction of nursery stocks, lemons and 
avocados totaled at least $100 million, said Deputy Agricultural Commissioner 
Jim Fullmer. 
</P>
<P>
Even in urban Los Angeles County, agriculture officials said the chill caused 
at least $500,000 in damage, mostly to landscape bushes and flowers. "It could 
reach $1 million or $2 million easily," said Bob Donley, deputy director in the 
agricultural commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural officials said San Diego and Orange County growers apparently were 
spared major damage. 
</P>
<P>
The Arctic air mass which brought the freeze is slowly dissipating, forecasters 
said, granting a brief reprieve for the Christmas week, with temperatures in 
Los Angeles expected to stay in the the 60s. The Civic Center high on Monday 
reached 65, 10 degrees higher than the day before. 
</P>
<P>
But forecasters say another cold front may be on the way. It is now riding 
along the Canadian Rockies and into Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fairly stationary, but it's getting ready to make a move," said 
meteorologist Steve Burbach of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts to 
The Times. Burbach predicted the next frigid blast will hit Northern California 
over the weekend, arriving here early next week. 
</P>
<P>
Burbach added, however, "It won't be as widespread or as difficult to combat." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, California continued Monday to feel the effects of the "Arctic 
Express," as one National Weather Service forecaster dubbed the front that 
swept in four days ago. 
</P>
<P>
The low at the Los Angeles Civic Center was 35 degrees -- two degrees above the 
record low for the date set in 1879, said Weather Service meteorologist Jerry 
Steiger. Records were broken, however, in San Francisco with a low of 32, in 
Oakland with a low of 34 and in San Jose, where the mercury dropped to 23 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The icy conditions have taken a toll not only on business but on human lives as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Two possible hypothermia deaths were reported by the Los Angeles County 
coroner's office. The body of a 47-year-old man was found Saturday in his 
mobile home in the northeast San Fernando Valley and an elderly woman was 
discovered the next day in her garage in the Wilshire area. Orange County 
authorities also reported that a 57-year-old transient died of hypothermia in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Two unidentified transients died in a fire in a vacant auto repair shop in 
South-Central Los Angeles on Monday night after they had built a fire in a 
large metal container to heat the building where several men reportedly lived, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the men usually built fires outside in the metal drum, but cold 
weather apparently forced them inside. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said cause of the blaze in the 5000 block of South Vermont 
Avenue was under investigation. Two other men in the structure at the time of 
the 7 p.m. blaze were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
In the Antelope Valley, Thomas Hunsaker, 21, was killed after he lost control 
of his car, which hit an ice patch and skidded into a light pole at 17th Street 
and Avenue K in Lancaster, sheriff's deputies said. Temperatures there had 
dropped to 5 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Another measure of the cold came from the Southern California Gas Co. The 
utility reported that Friday's natural gas consumption of 5.3 billion cubic 
feet set an all-time high in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Farther north, in the Santa Cruz Mountains, a severe water shortage apparently 
was caused by people running their faucets to prevent frozen pipes. 
</P>
<P>
Burst pipes were a common complaint from Napa Valley wineries to the Los 
Angeles Equestrian Center in Burbank. Sheriff's officials in the Antelope 
Valley reported receiving 200 to 300 calls a day from people seeking help with 
their plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
"We just tell them to go out and shut off the water, and call a plumber," said 
Deputy Ronald Giddings. 
</P>
<P>
As for food industry officials, they were still trying to gauge agriculture's 
losses and what impact they may have on consumers. Most said it is still too 
early to tell. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers for the 104-store Stater Bros. chain said they don't know whether they 
will have enough winter fruit and produce to meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
"We're evaluating ads that we are running in the next two weeks to be sure we 
will have what's advertised," said Stater Bros. Chairman Jack H. Brown. "If 
not, we will have to pull them and substitute other items." 
</P>
<P>
Importers of Chilean fruit expect demand to pick up for their product as 
grocers seek to make up for lost California supplies. 
</P>
<P>
David Oppenheimer &amp; Co., which imports Chilean fruit, expects a cargo ship 
loaded with nearly 2 million pounds of Chilean peaches, plums, nectarines and 
other fruits to arrive Thursday at the Port of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Until the weekend, the state had been projecting a crop of 80-million, 37 
1/2-pound cartons of navel oranges for the season, which runs from October 
through April of 1991. And 46-million cartons of Valencia oranges were expected 
from March through December or January, said Ron Radenz, a statistician for the 
California Agricultural Statistics Service. 
</P>
<P>
Sunkist Growers Inc. cooperative spokeswoman Claire Peters said that 
preliminary estimates indicate that 50% of the citrus crop may have been 
damaged. Some of the damaged crop, however, may be salvaged for juice, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 20% of the avocado crop was lost to the cold front, said Mark Affleck, 
president of the California Avocado Commission. The state produces 90% of the 
nation's avocados. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, the 1991 harvest may be higher than the 200 million pounds 
picked in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Flowers may also be affected. If there is much more cold weather, Valentine's 
Day bouquets "may cost you a little extra," said Marilyn Corodemas, chief 
deputy agriculture commissioner for San Diego County, where the most flowers in 
the state are grown. 
</P>
<P>
At the San Gabriel Nursery in Los Angeles County, the frost caused at least 
$200,000 damage and perhaps much more, according to Douglas Darrow, a company 
salesman. 
</P>

PRIVATE HIGHWAY REST STOP SERVES 2 MEN -- AND PLENTY OF FRIENDS

You can't miss Ed and Junior's half acre 150 miles northeast of Los Angeles on 
U.S. 395 in this old mining town. 
</P>
<P>
It's the fence of highway signs that catches your eye -- a Speed Limit 50 sign 
is one of the gates. 
</P>
<P>
Icy, Dips, Yield, Watch Out For Cattle, Right Lane Closed Ahead, Thru Traffic 
Merge Left and School Bus Stop 400 Feet are but a few of the nearly 100 road 
warnings that line the fence. 
</P>
<P>
A Caltrans official stopped one day wanting to know where the signs came from. 
"He thought we stole them. I explained we bought them from a salvage yard. I 
showed him the receipts," said Ed Smith, 67. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists and tour buses stop out of curiosity when they spot the fence and the 
incredible clutter littering the half acre. 
</P>
<P>
A Welcome sign hangs out front. 
</P>
<P>
There are Caltrans rest stops along the freeways. Then there's Ed and Junior's 
place. 
</P>
<P>
David (Junior) McLarnon, 67, and Smith are pack rats. They collect everything. 
Using a metal detector, McLarnon collects memorabilia from old mining camps in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
Smith comes from a long line of pack rats. He has cans and packages of food and 
medicine, toys, dolls, buttons, hats, tools, kitchen utensils, furniture and 
much much more that he, his father and grandfather before him collected. 
</P>
<P>
He picks up an old razor blade sharpener and says: "Things like this most 
people never saw before." 
</P>
<P>
"We get folks from around the world dropping in on us. Even a man from France 
was here. People stop, stretch their legs, spend a couple of hours looking at 
our stuff and visiting, then go on their way." 
</P>
<P>
Hunting and fishing friends heading north or south overnight at Ed and 
Junior's. So do truck drivers passing through. They sleep in their campers and 
trucks in a parking lot on the half acre or under the stars on a row of beds on 
the roof of Smith and McLarnon's house. 
</P>
<P>
"We enjoy visitors. We don't charge anybody. A lot of them would like to buy 
some of the stuff. We don't sell anything," said McLarnon. 
</P>
<P>
The two men have been hunting and fishing buddies for 40 years. Smith paid $760 
for the half acre and a 1902 mining shack in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
For the first few years they stayed overnight in the shack on their trips to 
and from the High Sierra. Smith lives in Orange, McLarnon in Chula Vista. 
They're both married with children and grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
McLarnon retired in 1979. Smith retired five years ago. McLarnon spends 90% of 
his time here, Smith 60%. Neither of their wives ever comes to Red Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
The two men added several rooms and patios to the mining shack, all constructed 
of scrap material. The patios, rooms and the rest of the property are filled 
with what they call "PPJ" -- pre-plastic junk. 
</P>
<P>
In his collection McLarnon has three dozen turn-of-the-century watches thrown 
away by miners when the watches stopped running. He has mining equipment, 
rusted silverware, coins, porcelain pots and pans and dozens of skillets. Old 
iron bedposts serve as borders for plants and trees. 
</P>
<P>
A mining camp outhouse has carpet on the floor, walls and ceiling. A highway 
sign on the outhouse door proclaims: "No Parking 8 a.m. to 12 Noon." Smith has 
10,000 sea shells he collected in the South Pacific when he was in the Navy in 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Many who visit the two men are regulars who drop in and say hello whenever 
driving by Ed and Junior's private rest stop. It's a stop no one ever forgets.

CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christmas, celebrating the birth of Jesus, is observed Dec. 25 by most of 
Christendom. But because different calendars are used to determine when the 
holiday occurs, most Armenian churches celebrate the holiday Jan. 6 and certain 
Eastern Orthodox churches -- Serbian, Coptic and old Russian -- observe the 
holiday Jan. 7 
</P>
<P>
TRADITION: The earliest evidence of the observance of Christmas is from 
4th-Century sources. 
</P>
<P>
In Rome, sometime before the year 336, the church celebrated the holiday Dec. 
25. In the Eastern churches, Jesus' birth and his baptism were celebrated 
together on Epiphany in early January. But before the end of the century most 
Eastern churches moved the observance to Dec. 25. Historians note that the 
Christian holiday thus competed with holidays in the Roman world -- the 
Saturnalia (Dec. 17), one of merrymaking and gift exchanges; the birth date of 
Mithra (Dec. 25), an Iranian mystery god with a popular following, and the 
Roman New Year (Jan. 1), when houses were decorated with greenery and lights. 
</P>
<P>
OBSERVANCES: Although the gift-bearing Santa Claus and other secular lore mixes 
freely in popular celebrations, churches focus on the Nativity accounts found 
in the New Testament Gospels of Matthew and Luke. Manger scenes depict a humble 
birth and often combine distinctive elements from the two stories -- shepherds 
from Luke and the Magi, or "wise men," and the Bethlehem star from Matthew.

Military Front: Israel put its army on higher alert after Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein named Tel Aviv as his first target if war erupts over his 
occupation of Kuwait. U.S. forces in the gulf also were on heightened alert 
against potential terrorist attacks. 
</P>
<P>
At Camp David, President Bush was briefed by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on 
the readiness of U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
In his Christmas message, Bush told the troops that "Americans will send their 
prayers eastward across the ocean and halfway across the world, not only to the 
town of Bethlehem, but to the sands and shores where you stand in harm's way." 
</P>
<P>
In Saudi Arabia, Chief Warrant Officer Wesley Wolf, food adviser for the U.S. 
military, has planned 340,000 Christmas meals for the 280,000 U.S. troops 
there. Ingredients were ordered in September. The troops will also be 
entertained by Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic Front: Iraq's ambassador to the United States and its envoy to the 
United Nations were summoned home to Baghdad for talks, along with Iraqi 
ambassadors to a number of European nations. 
</P>
<P>
Trade Front: Representatives of International Physicians for the Prevention of 
Nuclear War said the embargo against Iraq is depriving Iraqis of food and 
medicine and has caused the infant mortality rate to double. But Western 
diplomats said that humanitarian relief is allowed under sanctions and 
suggested that medicine meant for civilians is being diverted to the military.

The U.N. trade embargo is depriving Iraqi civilians, including children, of 
critically needed medical supplies, a U.S. doctor who recently toured the 
region said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We found that sanctions are working, and working brutally, right now," Dr. 
Bernard Lown of the Harvard University School of Public Health said in an 
interview on NBC-TV's "Today" program. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad hospitals, including pediatric hospitals, lack insulin, intravenous 
solution and injectable forms of other antibiotics and anesthestics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. sanctions, imposed after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, 
allow trade in medicine and some foodstuffs. 
</P>
<P>
Lown is co-president of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear 
War, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985.

A 20-year-old homeless man, who apparently fashioned a noose from his own 
shoelaces, was found hanged from a utility pole, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities ruled the death a suicide. Despite the cold weather, the man was 
wearing khaki shorts, a light jacket and sneakers. The man, believed to be a 
Mexican national, was carrying no identification. His pockets were empty, and 
he left no note, police said. A coroner's official who asked to remain 
anonymous said that the man was identified through his fingerprints, which were 
on file.

The armed forces overthrew the elected government of this former Dutch colony 
Monday night after a dispute between its president and longtime military chief, 
Dutch and local news media reported. 
</P>
<P>
The army chief, Lt. Col. Desi Bouterse, had resigned earlier in the day, 
raising speculation that he would seek to seize control of the small mineral 
rich country on South America's northeastern coast. 
</P>
<P>
Bouterse led a military coup that toppled a legitimately elected government in 
1980 and ruled the country until elections were held in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
But relations between the government and Bouterse have been strained since the 
elections, captured in a landslide by the governing Front for Democracy and 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
The acting commander of the armed forces, Ivan Granoogst, read a statement on 
Surinamese television saying the army was acting in line with its 
"constitutional responsibility" in taking control of the government, Dutch 
Television said. 
</P>
<P>
Dutch radio said the army promised to organize elections within 100 days. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday night, a reporter for the Surinamese newspaper De Ware Tyd told 
the Associated Press bureau in San Juan, Puerto Rico, that the military had 
overthrown the government. 
</P>
<P>
Later, all telephone and telex lines to Suriname went out of service. In 
Washington, the State Department had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
In a dispute with President Ramsewak Shankar, Bouterse announced Saturday that 
he was resigning as head of the military in this nation of 380,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
He was angered by the treatment he had received at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport 
on a recent visit and accused Shankar of collaborating with Dutch officials who 
refused to grant him a visa or allow him access to journalists.

A 19-year-old woman was kidnaped, raped and beaten early Monday by two armed 
men who identified themselves to her as gang members from Los Angeles County, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
"When they released her, they said that by not killing her, that was their 
Christmas present to her," Police Lt. Ed McErlain said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was walking from her car through the parking lot of her apartment 
complex when the men approached and asked directions, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"She attempted to run from the men, but they grabbed her and struck her in the 
face several times and forced her into their vehicle at gunpoint," McErlain 
said. 
</P>
<P>
They held her captive for about an hour, beat her repeatedly and raped her, he 
said. Both men had guns. 
</P>
<P>
After she was released, the woman went to a nearby home and called police. She 
was taken to a local hospital, where she was treated for a possibly broken 
nose, McErlain said. 
</P>
<P>
McErlain said one assailant was described as Samoan-American, about 22, 5 feet, 
7 inches tall and 200 pounds, with brown hair. The other was described as a 
stocky Latino, about 22 and 200 pounds, with brown hair. The victim described 
their car as a "four-door, shiny blue compact."

12 HOMELESS PASADENA FAMILIES RELOCATED

<TEXT>
<P>
Twelve Pasadena families removed Friday night from a roach- and rat-infested 
apartment building have found permanent new quarters within a mile of their old 
home, city officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Fire Chief Kaya Pekerol said the city used nearly $17,000 in emergency 
funds to relocate the mainly Latino, low-income residents, who will receive 
federal rent subsidies in their new homes. 
</P>
<P>
Pekerol said the relocated residents need furniture, and donations are being 
accepted by the city under the Raymond Relocation Fund. 
</P>
<P>
The 48 residents were moved out of their apartment building at 543 N. Raymond 
Ave. after the city declared it a public nuisance and a safety hazard. Owner 
David O. Howard was ordered to make repairs and may have to contribute toward 
the relocation costs, Pekerol said.

HARBAUGH IS SUPER-COMPETITIVE AND INJURED, TOMCZAK IS AN OVERACHIEVING, 
BLUE-COLLAR TYPE AND WILLIS IS A ROOKIE WITH A BRIGHT FUTURE

<P>
Before he was hurt last week, taking his place with no fewer than seven other 
injured NFL quarterbacks in hospitals or on the bench, James J. Harbaugh 
started 12 consecutive games for the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Before that he was a Michigan man. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, growing up as a football coach's son in eight Midwestern and 
California communities, Harbaugh developed into the most competitive member of 
a most competitive family. 
</P>
<P>
Even in grade school, he was in every organized youth league in town: 
basketball, wrestling, hockey, football and baseball. The Saturday wrestling 
matches were at 6 a.m., and, with his mother or father at the wheel, he changed 
clothes in the family car en route to basketball at 10 o'clock and then on to 
the afternoon sports. 
</P>
<P>
And he counted the day irretrievably lost when he didn't come home a runaway 
winner in every game. 
</P>
<P>
One winter morning, however, the neighborhood was snowed in. So with the help 
of his brother, John, who is 15 months older, Harbaugh designed a deceptively 
rugged little inside game in which the only prop is a deck of playing cards. 
</P>
<P>
"If you turn up a seven -- let's say the seven of diamonds -- you have to do 
seven pushups," he said the other day. "If it's a king or queen, you have to do 
10. An ace, 15. The joker, 20." 
</P>
<P>
The last time they played, last summer, the Harbaugh brothers ran through the 
deck twice. Depending on the luck of the draw, that, in an hour or so, was an 
average of 400 pushups apiece. 
</P>
<P>
When at the end, Jim drew an eight and three face cards in succession, he 
staggered through the last 38 pushups, then joined immediately in the 
prearranged push-off. 
</P>
<P>
"John was still going strong at 67 when I died of exhaustion," Harbaugh said. 
"So he beat me -- John and the cards. But I'll get him next time, and he knows 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Next time. Sure. Harbaugh is always confident that he'll win next time. But in 
football, that won't be soon. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, he won the starting job from the two other Bear quarterbacks, 
veteran Mike Tomczak and rookie Peter Tom Willis, but a shoulder separation has 
suddenly ended his season two weeks before the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
That brings up two questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Who will lead the Bears in the playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Who will lead them next season? 
</P>
<P>
Because Tomczak is the club's only remaining experienced quarterback, he has 
the post now, Coach Mike Ditka said. 
</P>
<P>
The favorite for next year is Harbaugh. The therapy prescribed for full 
recovery from shoulder surgery, if it is necessary, would be child's play to a 
guy whose idea of fun on a snowy day is 467 push-ups. 
</P>
<P>
But Willis could be a threat to both. The rookie from Florida State is the best 
passer on the club -- or so it seemed in Detroit this month when, after 
Harbaugh and Tomczak were injured, Willis drove the Bears 74 yards, completing 
seven of eight passes, each thrown crisply and accurately, the last for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Lions were in a prevent defense with only a three-man rush, 
Ditka announced that the rookie "intrigued" him. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter Tom had a great awareness of where to throw the ball, when to throw and 
who to throw to," Ditka said. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Willis is a possible Bear starter sooner or later. 
</P>
<P>
That makes three of them now. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OPPORTUNITY TIME 
</P>
<P>
From Red Grange to Walter Payton to Neal Anderson, for 71 years, the Bears have 
been a running team. Except for two short interludes when they were led by Sid 
Luckman and Jim McMahon, they always have had, or seemed to have, flawed 
quarterbacking. 
</P>
<P>
Among other kinds, they have had: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Good passers who lack mobility. That's Willis now. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tough, mobile quarterbacks who, somehow, never quite last until the 
playoffs. This year that's Harbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Big-play passers who throw killing interceptions. That's Tomczak. 
</P>
<P>
The three Bears in Ditka's 1990 quarterback collection are linked, someone has 
said, only by fiery field presence. 
</P>
<P>
One day in a training-camp scrimmage last summer, Tomczak, a blue-collar type 
who identifies with offensive linemen, dropped back nimbly and threw a perfect 
interception to a Bear linebacker, Mickey Pruitt. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of shuffling unhappily over to the sideline, Tomczak, jogging, 
followed the flight of his errant pass. Then, stepping up to Pruitt, he grabbed 
his face mask and gave it a sharp little twist. 
</P>
<P>
"There," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That's what Tomczak thinks of his passing game, sometimes. But he has assets 
and values, too. He is, in short, a Bear quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Having recovered from the leg-muscle injury that stopped him Dec. 16 in 
Detroit, Tomczak won his first 1990 start Sunday against Tampa Bay as Chicago, 
champion of the NFC Central, improved to 11-4. 
</P>
<P>
Next month, though, the Bears will be on a rougher playoff road than the other 
NFC champions. For the first time, winners of two of the league's six divisions 
will have to play on wild-card weekend Jan. 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
The NFC team is the Bears because they lost more games than the San Francisco 
49ers or New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
If that's particularly tough on a club that has lost its starting quarterback, 
it is also an opportunity for Tomczak or, possibly, Willis. 
</P>
<P>
Both are privately gearing up -- along with the seven other first-round 
quarterbacks -- to move through four January weekends to the gold at the end of 
the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Though they wear the same uniform, Ditka's passers are distinctly different 
types. 
</P>
<P>
Tomczak, 27, a six-year Bear veteran, is a gritty walk-on from Ohio State who, 
at 6 feet 1 and 198 pounds, is built like a defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
Willis, 23, a 188-pound third-round draft choice standing nearly 6-3, has the 
fluid presence of a basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan man Harbaugh, 25, 6-3, 225, is the only Bear with the physical 
appearance of an NFL quarterback. A four-year veteran, he is also the only 
active Bear quarterback drafted in the first round. He would be in his prime 
next month if he could play. 
</P>
<P>
The three Bears all have the collar-ad look that attracts large quantities of 
fan mail from admirers. All three are single. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, almost daily the mailman brings Tomczak one or two new teddy bears 
to add to the collection he once mentioned in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Tomczak, less extroverted than Harbaugh but no introvert, usually hangs out 
with the offensive linemen, as is the custom of many quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Harbaugh's outgoing personality pushes him to make friends easily. At one time 
or another, his teammates say, he has played cards with every Bear card player 
-- even the coaches and players on the defensive side. 
</P>
<P>
Willis, whose locker is between Harbaugh's and Tomczak's in the club dressing 
room at Halas Hall, is the shy, quiet one. Those who know him report that 
Willis is as self-confident as the other two, he just doesn't show it. 
</P>
<P>
Except, as they say at Florida State, on game day. 
</P>
<P>
Willis has ambitions to dethrone Harbaugh and Tomczak soon. The Bears, 
consulted about that, say it's too early to tell. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE COMPETITOR 
</P>
<P>
Man was placed on earth for one simple reason, Harbaugh reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The sole goal of life, in his view, is to succeed. To win. To beat other people 
-- at football, chess, push-ups, whatever. 
</P>
<P>
When Harbaugh revisits the family home -- now in Bowling Green, Ky., where his 
father coaches at Western Kentucky -- he walks in clutching big boxes of games 
in both arms. 
</P>
<P>
One recent holiday afternoon, he brought a new Monopoly set, his father, Jack, 
remembers -- instead of, say, flowers for his mother, or Bear-Packer tapes for 
Jack. 
</P>
<P>
And even before dinner, he got the whole family involved. 
</P>
<P>
As the family went at it ruthlessly, daughter Joani was the first to be forced 
out, then brother John and finally his mother, Jackie. 
</P>
<P>
An hour or so later, when it became clear that Jim had the drop on Jack, too, 
Jack admitted it. He pushed back his chair, looked at his scant remaining 
properties, then at his son, and said, "You win." 
</P>
<P>
"Not so fast," said Jim. "It isn't over until it's over." 
</P>
<P>
And, as Jack tells it, Jim kept the game going until his father had been 
stripped bare. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a strange one," said Jack. "Just winning isn't enough. He has to destroy 
you." 
</P>
<P>
Jim's fiancee, Linda Miller, recalls that after he'd taught her to play chess, 
he regretted it bitterly whenever she won, which was every now and then. 
</P>
<P>
They played their last game several years ago on an airplane, she said, while 
seated comfortably in first class, where the flight attendants, as usual, 
hovered. 
</P>
<P>
A last-semester law student at Loyola of Chicago, Linda, playing aggressively, 
seemed on the point of checkmating Jim when he abruptly stood up, grabbed the 
chessboard and threw it across the aisle as the pawns and pieces scattered up 
and down the airplane. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was competitive, but, oh, my," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That reminds Jackie Harbaugh of the year her son was 13, when, tidying up his 
room one day, she came across a sheaf of Jim's black-and-white pencil drawings, 
foretelling, she hoped, an artistic career. 
</P>
<P>
"But I knew I'd lost him to sports when I saw the best one," Jackie said. "It 
was a very realistic sketch of a human hand with the index finger pointing 
upward -- No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
During Jim's boyhood, his father coached at eight high schools and colleges -- 
Stanford and Michigan among them -- putting down stakes in eight towns. 
</P>
<P>
That would make neurotics of some kids, but Jim said, "I loved it. It was 
exciting. Today, the only thing I miss is old friends. I wish I had a hometown 
to go back to." 
</P>
<P>
He does have compensating memories. At Palo Alto, where he finished high 
school, he spent two years throwing the football with John Elway and other 
Stanford quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Said Jack Harbaugh: "I didn't take Jim seriously as a football player until the 
day Elway came up to me and said: 'Your boy is very impressive.' " 
</P>
<P>
That was likewise Bo Schembechler's judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Then coaching Michigan, now president of the Detroit Tigers, Schembechler said, 
"The first time I set eyes on Jim, I knew he was tough, confident, and athletic 
-- our kind. 
</P>
<P>
"He was an ornery little kid then, when his dad was coaching for me. When he 
grew up, we recruited him. He grew up to be a fun guy and a real competitor, an 
intense competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Harbaugh's lawyer, Leigh Steinberg, who has a stable of 15 NFL quarterbacks, 
said, "Jim is as competitive a human being as I've met in my life." 
</P>
<P>
In college, Harbaugh set some Michigan records, leading the nation in pass 
efficiency one year, but as a pro he has yet to set Chicago afire again. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Bears got off to a 9-1 start this fall in Harbaugh's first season 
as an NFL starter, they have since leveled off, prompting some to divide the 
blame between the players and Ditka's conservative, old-fashioned offense. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, if any, doesn't seem to be quarterback inexperience. Harbaugh has 
been either fantasizing or playing big-time football for 20 of his 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
In kindergarten, he said, he used to get off the school bus pretending it was 
the team bus at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
As a grade-school kid on freezing winter days in the Midwest, he practiced 
catching his own passes, bouncing the ball noisily off the basement ducts in 
the furnace room hour after hour, until his mother, at wit's end, stormed down 
the stairs, took possession of the ball and yelled, "No more." 
</P>
<P>
Then Harbaugh would sit in a corner, peering into a pretend microphone, and 
interview himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always Howard Cosell," he said, very slowly, using Cosell's inflections. 
"I always interviewed the star, Jim Harbaugh." 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he likes football, he said, "A, I'm good at it. B, Unlike other 
professions, you know for a certainty every week, every day, whether you're 
best or not." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
T-ZAK AND P.T. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago these days, with Harbaugh down for a while, it's Tomczak &amp; 
Willis vs. the world. 
</P>
<P>
They're both on the spot. The playoffs are vital to the Bears, for two reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- They want another Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And contemplating their future, they want to compare Willis and Tomczak 
head-to-head, as a coach said, "without having to divide the (repetitions) 
three ways (as they would if Harbaugh were in the picture)." 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Tomczak, who is known as T-zak or T, is the senior Bear quarterback, 
the club's 1989 starter before he was demoted and a part-time starter before 
that. He is also more accustomed than Willis to the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
The operator of several nightclubs for teen-agers in the Chicago area, Tomczak 
is a ham whose ambition is to live on a Caribbean island and play steel drums 
in a Jamaican band. 
</P>
<P>
"(I'd like to) cruise on a Formula 3-11 cigarette boat all day (and drum) at 
night," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One problem with moonlight drumming in the Caribbean is financial; pro football 
pays better. After six years in the league, Tomczak makes $800,000 to 
Harbaugh's $320,000 and Willis' $300,000 -- figures sure to be adjusted in 1991 
when Harbaugh plans a move into the NFL's millionaires' club. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, however, Tomczak is the ideal Chicago quarterback -- a role model 
for the hard-working, hopefully upward-bound majority. 
</P>
<P>
Born without standout talent, he has spent much of his life struggling to make 
a place for himself. Nobody wanted him in the Big Ten, where he was an Ohio 
State walk-on. Nobody drafted him in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
At heart, Tomczak isn't a quarterback at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked hard for everything I've achieved, (beginning) in high school," he 
told Chicago Sun-Times writer Kevin Lamb. "I kind of look at myself as an 
offensive lineman in a quarterback's number, because those are the guys who 
really work their butts off." 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Peter Tom Willis, known as P.T., looks at himself strictly as a 
quarterback -- as a superb passer -- although at Florida State for a while, he 
was almost the only one who did. 
</P>
<P>
A starter for Coach Bobby Bowden as a redshirt senior, and a big producer that 
season, Willis began at Florida State by spending four years on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
If he takes the Bears to the Super Bowl someday, the four-year snub will be 
remembered, no doubt, as the personable Bowden's biggest mistake. 
</P>
<P>
In his only shot, Willis, a Morris, Ala., native, took the Seminoles to No. 2 
in the United Press International voting and No. 3 on the Associated Press 
list, leading the team past Nebraska in the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears drafted the former Alabama player of the year with a pick they got 
from the Raiders for wide receiver Willie Gault. The fourth quarterback in the 
draft, Willis went behind Jeff George, Andre Ware and Tommy Hodson. 
</P>
<P>
After a quiet start in Chicago, he became a rave story the night he whisked the 
Bears down the field to an easy touchdown this month in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
One reason it was so easy, he said, is that he persuaded Ditka to let him run 
only two-minute drill plays. 
</P>
<P>
"That's all I get to work on at practice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He threw the eight-yard touchdown pass on a heads-up broken play. When the 
Lions blanketed his intended receivers on the right side, he wheeled around, 
scrambled left and found an end-zone target, Wendell Davis, who may be the 
surest-handed receiver in the league. 
</P>
<P>
The long, quick touchdown drive didn't surprise Willis. His philosophy after 
years as a backup is to be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be ready when your turn comes," he said. "You might not get it 
again. If you don't answer the bell, they're not going to keep ringing it."

NEWSWIRE: JOHNSON WILL GO TO USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAMILTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Toro High School's Rob Johnson, among the top high school quarterbacks in 
the Southland, has made an oral commitment to attend USC and is expected to 
sign a national letter of intent with the Trojans Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a 6-foot-5, 210-pound senior, was the top-rated quarterback in Orange 
County last fall, passing for 2,207 yards and 25 touchdowns while completing 
71% of his passes in 10 regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
An all-county wide receiver as a junior, Johnson became the first player in 32 
years to make the team at different positions. He was Orange County athlete of 
the year for 1989-90 after earning all-league honors in football, baseball and 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
A right-handed pitcher, Johnson said he would play both football and baseball 
at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I was recruited by some great schools, but the situation at USC was best for 
me," Johnson said. "I like the (football) coaching staff, the quarterback 
situation; their offense is similar to El Toro's, and the baseball facilities 
are great." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's older brother, Bret, and current USC quarterback Todd Marinovich 
played for rival schools at El Toro and Capistrano Valley in 1986-87. Bret 
played two seasons at UCLA before transferring to Michigan State, where he will 
be eligible next season. TOM HAMILTON

MORNING BRIEFING: WIDE RECEIVER GOES LONG FOR HOLIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the bowl season, Washington wide receiver Mario Bailey likes to work on 
his northwest route. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, at the Huskies' Golden West College practice site in Huntington Beach, 
he said: "I've never missed Christmas at home, and I don't want to start now if 
I can help it." 
</P>
<P>
Bailey's mother makes reservations for an airline in Seattle, so there's no 
problem with a 7 a.m. departure and a 7 p.m. return -- if the Northwest cold 
snap allows. 
</P>
<P>
Last Christmas, when the Huskies were in Southern California before the Freedom 
Bowl, he flew home for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
Said Bailey: "Uh oh, I probably shouldn't talk about that, because I don't 
think anybody knew I left last year. I got back and everything was cool, but 
I'm going to ask Coach (Don) James about it this year." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Name the kicker whose field goal ended the NFL's longest game on 
Christmas Day, 1971. 
</P>
<P>
Upright citizen: An unidentified fan of the Buffalo Bills worked some Christmas 
magic Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
After Buffalo's victory over Miami, the fan helped dismantle one of the Rich 
Stadium goal posts, then delivered his souvenir to radio station WGR. 
</P>
<P>
The station sold quarter-inch sections at $10 each, raising about $2,000 for 
Buffalo's Roswell Park Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Stick to hoops, dude: The promoters of last Saturday's basketball 
"doubleheader" in Atlanta, featuring Georgia Tech vs. Loyola and Georgia vs. 
Texas, were turned down personally by Pete Townshend of The Who when they tried 
to use his song, "Pinball Wizard," in their advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
But the games' marketing firm decided to go ahead with the theme in its printed 
materials, including the program cover, which showed Georgia Tech's Kenny 
Anderson and Georgia's Litterial Green. 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Journal and Constitution reported: "During a photo session with a 
'Simpsons' pinball machine, the ever-competitive Anderson got tired of being 
taunted with 'You're an underachiever, man.' He worked hard and improved his 
score -- but got caught tilting the machine." 
</P>
<P>
Hallowed spaces: Fox Network's "American Chronicles" recently put together a 
nostalgic tribute to Chicago's old Comiskey Park, which closed in September and 
is being replaced a new Comiskey Park across the street. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the segment, three children stand near one of the old park's 
gates, carrying cardboard signs. 
</P>
<P>
On each sign is one word. The kids hold them up to make: "COME NEXT YEAR." 
</P>
<P>
They turn the signs over to make: "WE'LL PARK HERE." 
</P>
<P>
Unmasking the truth: Last week's trivia question about the first NHL goalie to 
wear a mask should have substituted popularize for wear. 
</P>
<P>
Readers Dave Rogahn and Les Patrick pointed out that the first to wear a mask 
was not Jacques Plante of the Montreal Canadiens in 1959, but Clint Benedict of 
the Montreal Maroons in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
His nose had been broken in a game against the Canadiens, so he tried a leather 
apparatus that covered his forehead, nose and jaw. 
</P>
<P>
In the first game of his experiment, Benedict lost to Chicago, 2-1, then 
abandoned the mask, complaining that it obstructed his view of low shots. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Garo Yepremian kicked a 37-yarder at 7:40 of the second overtime 
period, giving Miami a 27-24 victory over Kansas City.

FAMILY PRIDE CAN BE BURDEN ON THE COURT

The news conference was over and the Forum press lounge was near empty, but not 
for long. Quickly, a father's pride filled the room. 
</P>
<P>
"Three years ago, I predicted Michael would be the one to bring home the Davis 
Cup," said Joe Chang, beaming as he leaned against a Kings trophy case. "That 
was in 1987, when I was talking to a tennis writer about the state of U.S. 
men's tennis, which was very bad at the time. There wasn't anyone. That year, 
Michael won one match at the U.S. Open and it became a very big story -- this 
American kid won a match. 
</P>
<P>
"But I say, 'Look at three years down the road. Michael's a good all-surface 
player. He should be ready by 1990. He will be the one to bring back the Cup in 
1990.' " 
</P>
<P>
The prophecy was realized three weeks ago and Joe Chang continues to bask in 
the glory. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been published all over the world," he said. "The other day, someone sent 
me a story from India that said, 'Michael Chang's father predicted he would 
win.' " 
</P>
<P>
Deep down, Michael wishes these people would stop sending Joe newspaper 
clippings. It only encourages him. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he was crazy for saying that," Michael said sternly. "I think he's 
very lucky it turned out that I was able to contribute this year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I've been cautioning him more and more not to say things like that, because it 
puts more pressure on me and if I don't come out and do something like that, it 
makes me look bad and it makes him look foolish. I think that's something you 
should keep to yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Michael and Joe have talked about it, but you know Joe. He's not about to quit 
while he's ahead. Soon, the topic turned to the tennis year of 1991 and soon, 
Joe was up and at it again. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'll do well, because of the new ranking system," Joe said. (Players 
will be ranked in 1991 by their comparative performance in events also played 
in 1990.) "Last year, before the French Open, he had won no matches. If he does 
anything early next year, he'll be ranked very high. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows? By May, he may be at the top." 
</P>
<P>
Uh oh. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Joe's math is a bit askew. Michael went 2-5 in pre-French Open 
matches, but that included going 0-4 at Memphis, Munich, the German Open and 
the Italian Open. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, the point remains the same. Because the first third of Michael's 
1990 season was a wash -- he had a fractured hip, made a premature comeback, 
then went into a subsequent retrenchment -- he stands to clean up during the 
first third of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an up-and-down year," said Michael, who has seen his 1990 world 
ranking yo-yo from No. 5 to 24 to 10 to its current residence at 15. "But 
overall, it's been a good year, considering the circumstances -- winning the 
Davis Cup and reaching the semis in the Grand Slam Cup." 
</P>
<P>
The hip injury is a big thing to be over. This time last year, the consensus 
was that Chang, the 1989 French Open champion, would never be the same. It was 
a rare injury -- a break in the hip socket, extremely unusual in sports -- and 
Chang's run-till-the-other-guy-drops game depends mightily on two fully 
functional hip sockets. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought it was totally career-threatening," Chang said, "but during 
the first six months, I had these thoughts that go through your mind -- about 
Jimmy Arias and Tracy Austin, great players who were so injury-prone, it really 
hurt their careers." 
</P>
<P>
He wobbled through the opening months of the year and by the French Open in 
early June no one was expecting anything -- except, maybe, Joe Chang. But 
Michael reached the quarterfinals at Paris. Chang's game became hip again. He 
made the semifinals in Washington D.C., the final in Los Angeles and won the 
Canadian Open. 
</P>
<P>
Later, it was on to Vienna and St. Petersburg, Fla., for Davis Cup rounds III 
and IV and the gospel according to Joe Chang. Strange but true: Joe tried to 
talk Michael out of the matches against Austria because they were played on 
clay during the middle of the hardcourt season -- another chance for Michael to 
slip out of sync. 
</P>
<P>
This time, though, Michael won the debate. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, I knew that to go to Austria, win or lose, would be exciting. It was 
an experience I might only get once in my lifetime," Michael said. "We just 
tried to think of all the pros and cons and we decided that maybe this would be 
a good time to go. 
</P>
<P>
"It was on clay, my best surface, and I had never played (a Davis Cup match) 
away, so this would be another new experience for me. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, the way it turned out, it was a very positive experience." 
</P>
<P>
He might say that. Joe, of course, goes further. Father still marvels at the 
way son hung in during his winner-take-all match against Horst Skoff, which 
lasted two days and required Michael to rally from a two-set deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was right after (Thomas) Muster beat (Andre) Agassi to tie it and the 
emotions in the stadium were running so high," Joe said. "Skoff came in, ready 
to win it. With that crowd, he seemed unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
"But the funny thing is, Michael never seemed nervous. When he won the fourth 
set, they had to suspend the match because of the lateness of the hour and 
that's when it turned around. Skoff had a whole night to think about it and 
right after Michael won the fourth set, I remember the Austrian captain saying, 
'Oh no, he always wins the fifth set.' 
</P>
<P>
"He knew Michael had won his last seven five-setters." 
</P>
<P>
Eight would prove too much for the Austrians, sending the Americans home to St. 
Pete, where Chang and Agassi and the Rick Leach-Jim Pugh doubles team would 
prove too much for the Australians. Davis' trophy was America's cup again, just 
as Joe said it would be. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 1991 beckons and with Phil Dent enlisted to bulk up Chang's 
serve-and-volley approach, Michael believes more strides are within reach. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm in a good position," he said, "to go into 1991 strong, but 
quietly." 
</P>
<P>
As long as Dad's around, quiet could be tough.

TENNIS: MICHAEL'S BROTHER, CARL, PLAYS, TOO, BUT HE ALSO HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
EXPLORE OTHER AVENUES WHILE ATTENDING CAL. HE HASN'T DECIDED IF HE WANTS TO

<P>
Carl Chang is not a bad tennis player. He's just not the best in his family. 
</P>
<P>
There's no disgrace in that when your brother is running around the world 
winning the French Open and playing in the Davis Cup. 
</P>
<P>
For Chang, brother of Michael Chang, being second best in tennis has never been 
a problem. It has allowed him to explore other avenues. 
</P>
<P>
Chang has followed academic pursuits at the University of California. He 
expects to graduate this June with a business degree. 
</P>
<P>
His specialty is political economy in an industrial society, which includes 
healthy doses of business administration, economics and political science. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael has a career, he's accepted that," Carl Chang said. "He has to be more 
focused on tennis. The pressure is not that extreme on me. I've had options." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, tennis is still a large part of Carl Chang's life. The No. 2 player 
in the family is the Bears' No. 3 singles player. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, 21, will be one of the top players in the Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches 
Assn.'s Holiday Classic beginning Thursday at the Sunny Hills Racquet Club. 
It's his first tournament since October, when he reached the quarterfinals of 
the NCAA indoor championships. 
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, Chang has juggled class loads -- he is carrying 15 
1/2 units this semester -- and returned volleys and last week was typical for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, he had finals, and since he had been studying 
for three weeks, hadn't had much time to work on the old serve. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Chang finally picked up a racket to cram for the ITCA, which will 
feature players from some of the nation's top college programs. 
</P>
<P>
"With finals, I never have time to practice," Chang said. "It's been about a 
month since I've really played. The ITCA tournament will be a nice way to get 
back into it." 
</P>
<P>
The tournament is on familiar ground for Chang, who works out at Sunny Hills 
when he's at home. He lost there to David Harkness of BYU in the final of the 
Holiday Classic in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the tournament will be a starting point. Chang will compete in two 
others during January to prepare for his final college season. 
</P>
<P>
It will be his last season as an amateur, and when it's over, Chang said he 
will decide whether he wants to continue in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when I think that tennis is what I want to do. Other times, I 
think I want to go into other areas of life," he said. "I just don't know what 
I want to do yet." 
</P>
<P>
Chang's career, although not as distinguished as his brother's, is one that 
would be envied by most players. He was a top junior player and had victories 
over Pete Sampras, who won the 1990 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
But Carl was overtaken by Michael, who turned pro at 15 and, in 1989, became 
the youngest player, at 17, to win the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Chang's career did not skyrocket, though. 
</P>
<P>
"Carl's priorities were different than Michael's," said Joe Chang, their 
father. "Carl wanted to get a college education." 
</P>
<P>
That was no problem, since all the top schools wanted him. He was one of the 
top tennis recruits in the nation as a senior at San Dieguito High School. 
</P>
<P>
Although he is not as quick as his brother, Carl is bigger and has a stronger 
serve. He also has the same tenacity and competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"Carl was an animal," said Larry Mulvania, Chang's high school coach. "He had a 
way of looking when he got competitive. It's hard to describe, but the guy on 
the other side of the net would dissolve." 
</P>
<P>
California Coach Scott McCain liked that look, and Chang liked Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore, Chang stepped in when injuries left the team short-handed. He 
played No. 1 singles for part of the season and finished 20-9. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Chang split time between singles and doubles, where he teamed with 
Bent-Ove Pederson. They became one of the better teams in the nation and were 
the ones who clinched a Pac-10 victory over Stanford, which later won the NCAA 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Carl has been a rock," McCain said. "He has tremendous abilities and plays, no 
matter what. There have been times when I've had to force him to sit out of 
matches because of injuries. He's the ultimate team player." 
</P>
<P>
But tennis was only half the reason Chang chose California. He has excelled in 
the classroom, too. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, he was accepted into the program on the political economy in an 
industrial society. Students need at least a 3.3 grade-point average to be 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to go into business administration because it focuses too much 
on numbers," Chang said. "And economics has too much theory. Right now, I'm 
getting a good taste of all the business fields." 
</P>
<P>
Where it will lead, Chang doesn't know. He has thought about the import-export 
business and is also considering international investment. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis? He may remain involved but not necessarily as a player. He is 
considering working off the court to help his brother. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a formidable team. Michael would win the money, and Carl would 
invest it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a possibility, and we've talked about it," Carl said. "It would include 
all the stuff I love to do." 
</P>
<P>
The brothers made a trial run last summer, when Carl accompanied his brother on 
the tour. Besides being a companion, he helped organize Michael's schedule and 
took care of details. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time they had traveled together without their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to see a lot of Europe, and we got to spend some time together," Carl 
said. "Because of my school and his playing, we haven't had much time with each 
other in the last couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Carl also got the chance to test himself on the pro tour. Playing as an 
amateur, he teamed with his brother in doubles in two tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
They were eliminated in the first round in Washington, D.C., and won one match 
in the international tournament in New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
It was Carl's first pro victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I'm now ranked in the top 400 (in doubles)," he said. "Boy, it was quite 
an experience. We were at center court, and the atmosphere was like nothing I 
ever felt. It was very intense." 
</P>
<P>
Whether it will be Chang's last tour appearance is something not even he knows. 
For now, his main concerns are school -- he will carry 17 units next semester 
-- and helping the Bears win the national title. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a whole semester before I have to make any decisions," Chang said.

NEWBERRY MIGHT PLAY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No. 1 draft choice Bern Brostek, who has backed up at center and guard this 
season, played most of Sunday's loss to the Atlanta Falcons at left guard in 
place of Tom Newberry, who has a sprained ankle, and Coach John Robinson thinks 
that's where Brostek just might end up. 
</P>
<P>
And, perhaps more interesting, Robinson suggested Monday that it might be best 
for Newberry, one of the top guards in the league, to play center because 
Brostek is more suited to play guard than Newberry. 
</P>
<P>
How did Brostek do Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
"He will do better in the future," Robinson said. "He's big and he'll be a real 
powerful player." 
</P>
<P>
And those are the kinds of things you want to see in a guard, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Using his skill at guard, he'll be more important to an offense," Robinson 
said. "And I think he'd be a real good guard. And there might be some logic in 
having Newberry become the center. You know, assuming that (current veteran 
center) Doug Smith is phasing out. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Because Newberry is what a center has to be: quick, able to get under 
(defensive linemen), to get around. The guards, there's more requirements now 
for them to be pass blockers than there used to be. Used to be the bull guys, 
the stars, were outside. Now there are a few just really good pass rushers 
(inside)." TIM KAWAKAMI

The Cleveland Browns' 12 assistant coaches have been told they should begin 
looking for other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Interim coach Jim Shofner avoided using the word "fired" when referring to the 
assistants. But owner Art Modell said it would be in the assistant coaches' 
best interest to look for work elsewhere, because the Browns will be hiring a 
new head coach once the season ends. 
</P>

New England quarterback Tommy Hodson's sprained left ankle was covered by a 
soft cast Monday, but he hopes to play in next Sunday's season finale against 
the New York Giants. If Hodson can't, Marc Wilson probably will start.

COLLEGE DIVISION: DOMINGUEZ HILLS WOMEN GOING IN RIGHT DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Van Girard became women's basketball coach at Cal State Dominguez Hills in 
Carson three seasons ago, after a successful run at Lynwood High, he didn't 
expect the transition to go without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
Girard admits that the coaching adjustment from high school to an NCAA Division 
II program was considerably more difficult than he anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I knew a lot about coaching basketball before I came here and I 
found out I didn't," Girard said. "There are a lot of successful coaches out 
there, especially in our conference, and I've tried to learn a little from all 
of them. I've learned so much at this level in the three years I've been here 
and I'm still learning." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills struggled to a 6-19 record in his first season and improved to 
12-15 last season. But in Girard's third season with the Toros, Dominguez Hills 
is finally on the move. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros are off to a 10-2 start, their best since 1984 and currently the top 
record of any team in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Girard credits several factors in the transformation from a second-division 
team to a CCAA title contender. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting the right kind of people we can win with, developing the right 
kind of attitude to be successful and our financial support is getting a lot 
better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The coach says instilling a positive attitude has been one of his most 
difficult tasks. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had to establish the feeling that we can beat people and that has taken 
a while to instill," Girard said. "There were times when we were just playing 
and waiting for the dam to burst." 
</P>
<P>
It has also taken time for Girard to recruit players who fit into his up-tempo 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say that the players that we now have on the floor reflect the kind of 
players I would recruit," he said. "There's only one player on the floor that's 
been here for (more than) three years and that's Devon Akita. She's the kind of 
player I would've recruited if I had been with the program back then." 
</P>
<P>
With only one senior on his roster, point guard Akita, Girard said the Toros 
are by no means a finished product. 
</P>
<P>
"We have yet to put together a 40-minute basketball game," he said. "We've 
played well for 33 minutes or 35 minutes and even about 37 minutes against (Cal 
State) Stanislaus. But we have yet to play for 40 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Girard said that probably has a lot to do with the team's youth. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it has to do with growing," he says. "With the exception of one 
player, we have no one who has been in this system for much more than a year." 
</P>
<P>
All things considered though, Girard is convinced that the program is finally 
heading in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say we're pretty much right where we wanted to be at this point," he 
said. "This is only the second recruiting class that I've been a part of and we 
still have a long way to go. But we're making progress." 
</P>
<P>
All five starters average in double figures in scoring, led by sophomore 
forward Denise Slater at 13.3 points and forward Dionne Vanlandingham at 13.2. 
Vanlandingham also averages 12.7 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're all doing better at finishing the play," Girard said. "Devon 
is doing a good job of getting the right people the ball. The whole team is 
working real hard and doing the right things to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his team's early success, Girard isn't ready to call his team the 
conference favorite. He still thinks nine-time defending champion Cal Poly 
Pomona deserves that distinction, even with its 6-5 nonconference record. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what's happening is the conference is getting better from top to 
bottom," Girard said. "I know Pomona lost a lot with the graduation of 
(All-American) Niki Bracken, but I still think Pomona is the team to beat." 
</P>
<P>
So he has set his sights on finishing the season at .500 or better, leading the 
conference in defensive statistics and reaching the conference postseason 
tournament for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"All of those are realistic goals that, barring injuries or the unforeseen, we 
can reach," Girard said. 
</P>
<P>
College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
Heading into the holiday break, the Claremont-Mudd-Scripps men are the only 
undefeated College Division basketball team in the Southland at 8-0. The Stags 
are idle until they visit Azusa Pacific Jan. 2. . . . With a run-and-gun 
offense that averages more than 100 points a game, UC Riverside has the next 
best record at 9-1 . . . For the second year in a row, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo 
and Occidental have each placed one player on the Kodak All-American football 
team. Senior defensive lineman Pat Moore of San Luis Obispo was named to the 
NCAA Division II first team and senior offensive lineman Peter Tucker of 
Occidental made the Division III first team. Last year, defensive lineman 
Robert Morris of San Luis Obispo and linebacker David Hodges of Occidental were 
chosen to the squads. 
</P>
<P>
Three College Division players from the Southland have been selected to the 
National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics All-America team in men's soccer. 
Junior midfielder Justin Wall of Westmont made the first team and senior 
forward Chris Palm and sophomore defender Chris Stempson of Azusa Pacific made 
the second team. . . . Whittier has named Ken Visser, an assistant at Cal State 
Long Beach since 1979, as its football coach. Visser replaces Don Uyeshima, who 
was interim coach last season when the Poets went 0-9. . . . Teams from the 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference are prominent in the 
preseason NCAA Division III tennis rankings released by the Intercollegiate 
Tennis Coaches Assn. Pomona-Pitzer is ranked No. 2, Occidental No. 11 and 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps No. 22 in women's play and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps is No. 
4 and Pomona-Pitzer No. 9 in the men's.

HOLLYWOOD PARK;

<P>
ROYAL REACH BIDS AULD LANG SYNE WITH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Marje Everett appeared in the paddock late in the day Monday at Hollywood 
Park, a trainer nodded in her direction and said: "I wonder if this will be her 
last day here." 
</P>
<P>
The answer probably won't come until a bitter, expensive proxy fight ends early 
next year. Everett's argument, that company debt has been reduced and that 
shareholders are receiving dividends again, is in contrast to business being 
bearish. On the day before Christmas, the 37-day meeting lurched to a 
conclusion, with 14,852 fans coming out to bet the Auld Lang Syne Handicap and 
eight other races. 
</P>
<P>
That was the lowest closing-day crowd Hollywood Park has had since it began 
racing in the fall in 1981. The figures for the entire season were mixed, with 
betting up almost 4% on a daily average over last season and attendance down 
close to 4%. 
</P>
<P>
The handle would been lower than last year's average except for money that 
flowed into the Hollywood pools for the first time from Nevada, Birmingham Race 
Course in Alabama and Canterbury Downs in Minnesota. Those three sources 
accounted for betting of more than $365,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Hollywood Park's daily fall handle -- $5.4 million -- was the best 
since off-track betting in California was introduced in 1987, but total 
attendance, on- and off-track, averaged 20,932, which is a drop of more than 
11% from three years ago. Figures do not reflect attendance from the 
out-of-state betting sites. 
</P>
<P>
Corey Nakatani, who won three major stakes -- two with Itsallgreektome and one 
with Countus In -- earlier in the season, rode Royal Reach to a wire-to-wire 
victory in the $84,450 Auld Lang Syne. The margin over Intelligently was 
officially a nose, but the placing judges said it was more like an inch. 
</P>
<P>
Intelligently lagged 11 lengths behind at one point, then barely missed running 
down Royal Reach at the wire. Davon finished third, three lengths back, in the 
1 1/4-mile grass race, which was run in 1:59, only two-fifths of a second 
slower than the track record. 
</P>
<P>
Royal Reach, owned by George Layman Jr. of Nanches, Wash., and trained by David 
Hofmans, had finished ahead of only three horses in his last four starts, 
losing by a total of 56 lengths. The 4-year-old gelding's last victory came in 
allowance company at Del Mar more than four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem in the last couple of races was that he raced in between horses 
and got scared," Hofmans said. "Then we had him in a couple of races where he 
couldn't get the lead and he kind of panicked." 
</P>
<P>
When Hofmans saw that Flanders Moss was scratched from Monday's race, he was 
convinced that Royal Reach would have no trouble making the early lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We had our own way today," Nakatani said. "I was told to get out there, set an 
easy pace and ask him to run at the three-eighths pole. He had his own way and 
was going real easy down the backside. We slowed them down (a half-mile in 46 
4/5 seconds), and when I asked him to kick, he kicked." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Intelligently, who has been running in expensive claiming races since 
coming here from France, was making the longest strides at the end. 
</P>
<P>
"This horse was flying," said his jockey, Alex Solis. "I wasn't sure if we had 
won it or not. That other horse was walking near the wire, and I thought we had 
the momentum to get him. My horse gave me a nice kick, but it just wasn't 
enough. That other horse set such a slow pace, and he opened up too many 
lengths for us." 
</P>
<P>
Royal Reach, carrying 115 pounds, one less than the top weight, paid $15.20. 
The Aga Khan's Deliorman, an Irish-bred colt making his American debut and 
carrying 116 pounds, was sent off the 19-10 favorite. He was never a contender 
and finished fifth in the nine-horse field. Lyphard's Melody, who ran eighth, 
is owned in part by R.D. Hubbard, the Texan who initiated the proxy battle 
against Everett.

Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
In an extraordinary comeback, Chris McCarron wound up the leading jockey at the 
meet with 54 victories. Last June 3, McCarron broke his legs and his right arm 
in a spill at Hollywood. He has won 11 titles at Hollywood. . . . Gary Jones 
won the training title with eight victories. . . . Rae Rafko, a 2-year-old 
daughter of Chief's Crown making her first start, won the fourth race and paid 
$104.80. She is trained by Steve DiMauro, a New Yorker who is wintering in 
California. . . . The last race was won by Port Washington for another New York 
trainer, Greg Martin. Port Washington tested positive for cocaine after running 
fourth at Hollywood on Nov. 8 and a hearing will be scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens' lead over Jose Santos is almost $700,000 in the battle for the 
national money championship. . . . Santa Anita opens Wednesday with the Malibu 
Stakes, which has drawn 12 horses. Santos rides Profit Key, who drew the 
outside post. Stevens rides Greydar, who won the Affirmed Handicap at Hollywood 
in his last start. Others running are Burnt Hills, Bedeviled, Past Prince, Due 
to the King, Forty Niner Days, Doyouseewhatisee, Copelan's Game, Pleasant Tap, 
Magical Mile and Restless Con, the Haskell Handicap winner at Monmouth Park who 
makes his first start in three months.

46 AUTO INSURERS GRANTED RATE INCREASES BY GILLESPIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie has approved requests for rate 
increases by 46 auto insurers, the first markups she has granted in more than a 
year, it was announced Monday. In addition, it was disclosed that "a few" more 
companies will get hikes before Gillespie leaves office Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
All 46 of the companies were authorized to increase the liability portions of 
policies, usually covering about 60% of the bill, but these were diminished 
either by smaller increases or actual decreases in the physical damage portions 
of the policies, according to Milo W. Pearson, chief of the Insurance 
Department's Rate Regulation Division. 
</P>
<P>
Pearson said the net increases are averages and will vary widely from customer 
to customer. When all increases contemplated by Jan. 7 are taken into account, 
companies doing almost one-third of the state's auto insurance business will be 
charging more. 
</P>
<P>
The raises will go into effect immediately, although since companies bill 30 
days in advance, customers will not begin paying the new rates until late 
January at the earliest. Since most companies stagger charges over three or 
six-month billing cycles, it will be some time before a majority of 
policyholders get the increases. 
</P>
<P>
The actions, which formally lift the freeze on auto insurance price increases 
Gillespie imposed in October, 1989, come at a time when the commissioner is out 
of the state, visiting her ailing mother in Greece. 
</P>
<P>
Between the time Proposition 103, the landmark insurance reform initiative, was 
passed in November, 1988, and the declaration of the freeze, 11 months later, 
many companies were allowed to raise their rates at will. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three biggest sellers on the commissioner's new list of increases, 
Allstate, which has about a 10% share of the total California market, was given 
a 7.6% liability premium increase and a 1.8% physical damage increase. The 
next-largest, Mercury Casualty, received a liability increase of 10% and a 
physical damage increase of 0.7%, while California Casualty was granted an 
across-the-board 14.8% increase. 
</P>
<P>
A few smaller companies received liability increases in the 37% to 50% range, 
and sizable physical damage decreases. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Electric Insurance Co. received a 52.6% liability increase and a 
28.7% physical damage decrease, National Fire of Hartford a 41.8% increase in 
liability and a 13.1% decrease in physical damage, and Pennsylvania General a 
37.2% increase in liability and a 25.8% decrease in physical damage. 
</P>
<P>
Liability claims against insurers have been moving steadily upward in 
California, particularly for personal injuries, while there has often been a 
decline in auto damage claims because of fewer accidents and more 
accident-resistant equipment, such as safety bumpers. 
</P>
<P>
All figures provided represent averages. A given customer, depending mainly on 
his or her driving record, might get either a substantially larger or smaller 
net increase than the figure authorized for the company, and conceivably might 
even get a decrease from a company authorized to raise its average rates just a 
little. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie has separately given many companies authority to shuffle their rates, 
giving "good" drivers with one or fewer minor citations and no at-fault 
accidents in the last three years lower rates, while raising "bad" drivers up 
to 40%, so this change too will be figured into individual billings. 
</P>
<P>
Because most companies have many more "good" drivers covered than "bad" ones, 
the increases are likely to hit the bad drivers disproportionately hard. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Monday's announcements, Pearson said Gillespie is likely to approve a 
Farmers group request for a 9% liability increase and a 1.9% physical damage 
increase before leaving office, but that a USAA request for an across-the-board 
6.6% increase will not be acted upon before John Garamendi assumes the 
commissioner's post next month. 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi, a Democrat, will be the state's first elected commissioner. He 
assailed Gillespie, a Republican appointee of Gov. George Deukmejian, when she 
disclosed two weeks ago that she intended to lift the freeze and grant rate 
increases, charging that she planned to give the companies "a Christmas bonus." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Garamendi did not know that the specific increases would actually 
be made public on Christmas eve. The commissioner-elect was unavailable for 
comment on Monday's announcements. 
</P>
<P>
Pearson said that two of the state's biggest sellers of auto insurance, State 
Farm and the Automobile Club of Southern California, have not filed for any 
general rate increases. State Farm, however, recently secured authorization 
from Gillespie to shuffle its rates, charging its "bad" drivers -- about 10% of 
its customers -- much more and many of its "good" drivers a little less. 
</P>
<P>
Under Proposition 103, company rate-increase requests must receive the approval 
of the commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
The commissioner is required to hold a public hearing for any increase of more 
than 7.5% in personal lines, or 15% in commercial lines, if it is requested by 
any consumer group or other party. But Pearson said that in the 46 company 
increases announced Monday, no such requests were made. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments in California insurance, it was disclosed that 
Deukmejian's press secretary, Robert Gore, will become chief spokesman for the 
state's major insurance lobby, the Assn. of California Insurance Companies, 
when Deukmejian leaves office. John H. Sullivan, undersecretary of the state 
Business, Transportation and Housing Agency, who has handled many insurance 
matters for the Deukmejian Administration, will become new president of the 
Assn. for California Tort Reform, a group closely aligned with the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie promised earlier in the year not to return to an industry job when 
she leaves the commissioner's office. Deukmejian has indicated he is 
considering naming her to a Los Angeles Superior Court judgeship, and has sent 
her name to a review panel of the State Bar of California for its 
recommendation on her qualifications

AUTO INSURANCE RATE INCREASES 
</P>
<P>
 This is a list of rate changes approved by outgoing Insurance Commissioner 
Roxani Gillespie for 46 auto insurance companies that requested them. All 
figures are expressed as the average percentage of rise or fall in semiannual 
premiums, and individual policyholder changes may differ. Changes for both 
liability and physical damage components of company policies are given. These 
were company names as listed by the state Insurance Department. In some cases 
names can be misleading. For instance, Auto Insurance of Hartford is actually 
an Aetna subsidiary, not part of the main Hartford company.

<P>
Police were searching for a man with an Uzi machine gun who held up a local 
sporting goods store Monday evening and may also have robbed a shoe store just 
a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 7 p.m., a man confronted a clerk at a Big 5 sporting goods store 
at 1610 W. Whittier Blvd. with what appeared to be an Uzi machine gun and 
demanded money, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The man fled with an unknown amount of cash, said La Habra Police Sgt. Kevin 
Rayisch. He was not spotted again. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 6 p.m., a Payless shoe store at 1400 West Imperial Highway in La 
Habra was also hit by a robber. 
</P>
<P>
In that holdup, a man took some items to the cash register and, when asked how 
he would be paying, produced a revolver and demanded cash. He got away with an 
unknown amount of money and was seen driving off in a gray or green two-door 
sedan. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported in either robbery.

FROM THE PULPIT THIS YEAR, PEACE IS THE MESSAGE;

Peace. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County church leaders are counting on the simple Christmas story message 
today to spiritually fortify those in their congregations whose loved ones 
stand at duty stations in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"The wish: peace on earth and goodwill to men should actually be peace on earth 
to men of goodwill," said the Rev. Chuck Smith, pastor of Calvary Chapel of 
Costa Mesa. "The story of Christmas is one of hope. When times are dark is when 
you need that hope." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, whose Protestant church is one of the best attended in the nation, said 
Monday that his congregation will come expecting to hear the traditional 
Christmas message. 
</P>
<P>
During a Christmas Eve service at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, the 
tense situation in the Middle East was at the center of the sermon by the Rev. 
Robert H. Schuller, nationally known televangelist. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a Christmas when hundreds of thousands of our finest young men are in 
the gulf," Schuller told the large gathering as he stood at a podium with a 
spectacular holiday scene of giant fir trees serving as a backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
"We are praying that the legitimate goal of the United Nations can be met 
without American blood being spilled. But if anyone sees this as a battle just 
for oil, they are thinking shortsightedly." 
</P>
<P>
Schuller urged his congregation to pray and to "reconnect" their own lives to 
more spiritual pursuits. He also asked those in the audience to find "homes" 
for God in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmastime means lots of things, but most of all it means being home," he 
advised. 
</P>
<P>
The Very Rev. Arthur Holquin, rector of Holy Family Cathedral in Orange, said 
the crisis in the Middle East has been very much on the minds of his 
parishioners and will be woven into the traditional Christmas message at Mass 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly at this time of year, we are looking for peace," Holquin said, 
adding that several people with relatives stationed in Saudi Arabia came to him 
after Mass on Sunday and asked that those service men and women be remembered 
Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
"If my heart is hurting because a loved one is away, I couldn't help but feel 
tense when everyone else is in a joyous mood," Holquin said. "With the way 
society approaches the season, we try to mention the planning for Christmas and 
the deep spiritual and theological message. 
</P>
<P>
"The message is of healing and of hope," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Holquin said that a parishioner came to him last week quite disturbed about the 
military buildup and asked what the parish could do. 
</P>
<P>
He is now considering a plan to host 24-hour prayer vigils at the cathedral, 
dedicating the prayer to the Middle East crisis. 
</P>
<P>
At Calvary Chapel, Smith said he is reserving more direct comments to his 
congregation about the U.S. military involvement for a service he holds every 
New Year's Eve. At that time, Smith said, he will be reviewing the events of 
the year and his thoughts would be more appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
"No one really wants war," Smith said. "But sometimes war is necessary for 
peace. When we have men like Hitler who are determined to expand their 
boundaries, they have to be stopped."

FREEZE: LOCAL AGRICULTURE ESCAPED COLD SNAP WITH MODERATE FROST DAMAGE, BUT THE 
TOLL IS MUCH WORSE ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE. CONSUMERS WILL PAY LATER.

As a slow warming trend took hold in Orange County and across California, 
agricultural inspectors spent Monday in citrus groves, vegetable fields and 
packinghouses trying to define the dimensions of the devastation that struck 
the state's frostbitten agricultural industry. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's $250 million in crops escaped the three days and nights of 
sub-freezing temperatures with only moderate frost damage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our preliminary data shows that there was spotty, moderate damage to the 
crops, but we don't expect there to be record damage," said Frank Parsons, 
deputy county agriculture commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
But elsewhere around the state, the news was worse for growers and, ultimately, 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
In Tulare County alone, where most of California's navel oranges are grown, 
Agricultural Commissioner Lenord Craft was estimating a $200-million loss in 
this year's harvest, which could translate into a $700-million loss for the 
local economy. In Ventura County, destruction of nursery stocks, lemons and 
avocados totaled at least $100 million, Deputy Agricultural Commissioner Jim 
Fullmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Even in urban Los Angeles County, agriculture officials said the chill caused 
at least $500,000 in damage, mostly to landscape bushes and flowers. "It could 
reach $1 million or $2 million easily," said Bob Donley, deputy director in the 
agricultural commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The arctic air mass that brought the freeze is slowly dissipating, forecasters 
said, granting a brief respite for the Christmas week, with temperatures in 
Orange County expected to reach the upper 50s to mid-60s. 
</P>
<P>
But forecasters say that another cold front may be on the way. It is now riding 
along the Canadian Rockies and into Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fairly stationary, but it's getting ready to make a move," said 
meteorologist Steve Burbach of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for 
The Times. Burbach predicted that the next frigid blast will hit Northern 
California over the weekend, arriving in the south early next week. 
</P>
<P>
Burbach added, however, "It won't be as widespread or as difficult to combat." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, California continued Monday to feel the effects of the "Arctic 
Express," as one National Weather Service forecaster dubbed the front that 
swept in four days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Overnight lows in Orange County were expected to dip into the low 30s. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, a low of 35 degrees Monday came within two degrees of the 
record low for the date, set in 1879. 
</P>
<P>
Records did fall, however, in San Francisco with a low of 32, in Oakland with a 
low of 34 and in San Jose, where the mercury bottomed out at 23. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, the coroner's office reported two possible hypothermia 
deaths. The body of a 47-year-old man was found Saturday in his mobile home in 
the northeast San Fernando Valley and an elderly woman was discovered Sunday in 
her garage in the Wilshire area. Orange County authorities also reported Sunday 
that a 57-year-old transient died of hypothermia in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
In the Antelope Valley, Thomas Hunsaker, 21, was killed after he lost control 
of his car, which hit an ice patch and skidded into a light pole at 17th Street 
and Avenue K in Lancaster, sheriff's deputies said. Temperatures there had 
dropped to 5 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of homeless people looking to escape subfreezing temperatures were 
expected to seek warmth at Orange County's two National Guard armories in Santa 
Ana and Fullerton, each housing up to 250 people. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Gas Co. reported that natural gas consumption was 
running about double the normal daily average for the year. Friday's total of 
5.3 billion cubic feet set an all-time high in Los Angeles, spokeswoman Mabel 
Solares said. 
</P>
<P>
Farther north, in the Santa Cruz Mountains, authorities were alarmed by a 
severe water shortage apparently caused by people running their faucets to 
prevent frozen pipes. 
</P>
<P>
Burst pipes were a common complaint from Napa Valley wineries to the Los 
Angeles Equestrian Center in Burbank. Sheriff's officials in the Antelope 
Valley reported receiving 200 to 300 calls a day asking for help with their 
plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
The food industry took stock Monday, attempting to measure the effect of 
agriculture's losses on supermarket prices and supply. 
</P>
<P>
Until the weekend, the state had been projecting a crop of 80 million 37 
1/2-pound cartons of navel oranges for the season, which runs from October 
through April, 1991. And 46 million cartons of Valencia oranges were expected 
from March through December or January, said Ron Radenz, a statistician for the 
California Agricultural Statistics Service. 
</P>
<P>
Sunkist Growers Inc. cooperative spokeswoman Claire Peters said preliminary 
estimates indicate that 50% of the citrus crop may have been damaged. Some of 
the damaged crop, however, may be salvaged for juice, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be fewer fruit and what there is will cost more," Peters said. 
</P>
<P>
About 20% of the avocado crop was lost to the cold front, said Mark Affleck, 
president of the California Avocado Commission. The state produces 90% of the 
nation's avocados. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, the 1991 harvest may be higher than the 200 million pounds 
picked in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers for the 104-store Stater Bros. chain said they don't know whether they 
will have enough winter fruit and produce to meet demand. 
</P>
<P>
"We're evaluating ads that we are running in the next two weeks to be sure we 
will have what's advertised," said Stater Bros. Chairman Jack H. Brown. "If 
not, we will have to pull them and substitute other items." 
</P>
<P>
Importers of Chilean fruit expect demand to pick up for their product as 
grocers seek to make up for lost California supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Flowers may also be affected. If there is much more cold weather, Valentine's 
Day bouquets "may cost you a little extra," said Marilyn Corodemas, chief 
deputy agriculture commissioner for San Diego County, where the most flowers in 
the state are grown. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Agriculture Commissioner Parsons said: "It will take three or 
four days to get a really good estimate on the damage, to see which plants are 
going to be lost, but right now we can tell there is obviously going to be some 
dollar loss." 
</P>
<P>
Among major crops sustaining damage, he said, were citrus, avocado, strawberry 
and ornamentals. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Reynolds, orchard manager for Treasure Farms in Irvine, said he had six 
helicopter and wind machines working over the weekend in an attempt to mix the 
warmer air above the ground with the frigid ground-level air. 
</P>
<P>
He said he lost about 10% of his Valencia orange crop. "We feel real fortunate 
compared to other (growers) in the state," said Reynolds, who added that damage 
in the Central Valley may make it a more profitable year for his crops. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with the loss it could be a pretty decent year for us," he said.

LAST-DAY BLITZ FILLS MALL PARKING LOTS

<P>
Orange County's malls were bustling with last-minute shoppers Monday, in the 
final and one of the busiest shopping days of an otherwise disappointing 
Christmas season for most merchants. 
</P>
<P>
Many workers had the day off or were given early leave, giving merchants hope 
that they would spend the day spending. The rush was also expected because of a 
trend in recent years toward late-season spending sprees. 
</P>
<P>
From the looks of the crowds, store owners were not disappointed. Parking lots 
reached capacity by midafternoon, with aisles packed with scurrying shoppers.

<P>
More important, customers were buying instead of just looking, retailers said. 
Five weekends after Thanksgiving, it was finally shopping do or die: Buy it now 
or go without -- at least until the after-Christmas sales. 
</P>
<P>
Department store executives and owners of small shops hoped that the Christmas 
Eve rush would turn around the sales slump, which has been prompted by concerns 
about the economy and political uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
While a strong showing in the last three days may not make the season a winner, 
at least it ended on an upbeat note. 
</P>
<P>
Amid worries about recession and war, the stores that seemed busiest were often 
discounters or featuring lower-cost items. At the Topkapi store in Westminster 
Mall, shoppers stood five and six deep at times Monday to buy earrings and 
costume jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
"We were prepared for everything," said a self-assured sales clerk, Linh Huynh, 
as she restocked a shelf. 
</P>
<P>
Derek Adams, a salesman at the Organ Exchange, said he thought that Saturday 
looked busier than Monday. "It's a little slower today," he said. "People are 
probably buying a lot more groceries." 
</P>
<P>
He admitted that he was a last-minute shopper himself, planning to scrounge 
through the mall when he got off work to find gifts for his 9-month-old 
daughter and various nieces and nephews. 
</P>
<P>
Even at tony Fashion Island in Newport Beach, shoppers said they had economic 
concerns on their mind. 
</P>
<P>
Leah Vankirk, waiting for a cash register at a Doubleday Bookshop, said she was 
buying books and compact discs as presents this year instead of more expensive 
gifts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a 'cutting-back' cost, and it's convenient for me to pick them up," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Business was also brisk at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. At the exclusive 
Gucci store, sales picked up in the last two weeks, said Carlo Armenise, the 
store manager. He said he expects sales of the store's line of designer 
handbags and leather goods to outpace last year's. 
</P>
<P>
At Burberrys, known for its trench coats and other outerwear, manager Steve 
Miller said the last-minute sales flurry had been strong. The daily sales 
volume since Saturday had been roughly equal to about two to three weeks of 
sales the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
At Tiffany &amp; Co., fur-clad matrons hovered over glass cases filled with 
sparkling jewels. Sales there were up this season, especially in the last week, 
said Jo Ellen Qualls, Tiffany's vice president and manager. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's biting their finger until the last minute," she said. CHRIS 
WOODYARD and CRISTINA LEE

SNAPPING UP THESE GIFTS SAVES LIVES

The parking lot was packed and crowds combed the aisles at 601 The City Drive 
in Orange on Christmas Eve, searching for perfect presents. 
</P>
<P>
The gifts they found won't fit in neat packages. And most won't sit still long 
enough to be placed under the tree. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Lisa Coil of Yorba Linda still planned to put a big bow on the dog 
that she and her friend, Michelle Loupe of Anaheim Hills, picked out for 
another friend. 
</P>
<P>
Coil chose the crossbred American Staffordshire-pit bull for Russell Long of 
Mission Viejo because the mutt is scrawny and looked as if he needed a home. 
</P>
<P>
"Russell said he wanted a dog that needs some help and some love," she said. 
"This was the saddest-looking one." 
</P>
<P>
Each year around Christmas, business picks up at the county animal shelter, as 
people adopt pets for gifts, said Jack Edwards, director of animal control. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been especially busy today," said Eric Stavenhagen, a kennel attendant. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Velazquez looked for hours with her daughter, Ashley, 6, and a friend of 
the family, Renee Barker, before finding the right dog for her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted a shepherd, but this is close enough to a shepherd," she said, 
leaning down to pat the head of a 4-year-old female elkhound. "She's so mellow, 
and I won't have to go through potty training and everything. And besides, not 
too many people want older dogs, so we're saving her life." 
</P>
<P>
People generally want to adopt puppies and kittens for presents, Edwards said. 
The last of those was adopted about a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
The few kittens that came in early Christmas Eve were quickly snapped up, 
unlike in the spring and summer, when many go unadopted. 
</P>
<P>
"People were fighting over them this morning," kennel attendant Sharon 
Linsmeier said. 
</P>
<P>
Kirsi Leedes and Bob McCarthy of Newport Beach were among those disappointed by 
the lack of kittens. 
</P>
<P>
Leedes "really wanted a kitten for Christmas," McCarthy said as the couple eyed 
a soft black kitten with a growing waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe I'm getting a cat. I didn't used to like them," Leedes said. 
</P>
<P>
After moving to Newport from Finland a year ago, Leedes said she began feeding 
abandoned cats in the neighborhood and grew to like them. Since then, she has 
taken in one cat, a Himalayan, and wanted a kitten to be its companion. 
</P>
<P>
The Goldmans of Anaheim were also partly successful in their search for a 
Christmas pet. "It just happens to be Christmas, and my husband wants a dog," 
Glenda Goldman said. "He's always had one, and we had one that died. So now 
he's convinced me that I'm going to get him a dog for Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
She, her husband and their two sons, Simon, 8, and David, 6, peered into cages, 
tentatively petting wet noses and scratching ears as a chorus of high-pitched 
yaps and lower barks and growls filled the air. 
</P>
<P>
The family settled on Ellen, a Norwegian elkhound mix, but she is licensed and 
must be held a week to see whether her owner claims her. If by Saturday the 
owner has not picked her up, the Goldmans are in luck. Otherwise, they'll 
choose another dog. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the animals desperately need homes, animal control officials 
generally discourage people from adopting pets as presents. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some terrible experiences where a person has said they want a dog 
earlier in the year, and then they receive it and they don't really want it, 
and they end up bringing it back to the shelter," Edwards said. SHANNON SANDS

2 SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES FIRED AFTER INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two sheriff's deputies who face criminal charges in the beating of a Maywood 
jail inmate have been fired from the Orange County Sheriff's Department, a 
sheriff's spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Richard J. Olson said deputies John Rice, 25, and Ivan Budiselich, 26, were 
fired Oct. 15 after an investigation by the department's internal affairs 
division, which looks into allegations of officer misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Olson declined to discuss the reasons for the dismissals because state law bars 
the release of specific information about internal police investigations. 
</P>
<P>
However, he did say the inquiry had been prompted by the Maywood incident. 
</P>
<P>
Rice and Budiselich were ordered last week to stand trial in Los Angeles 
Superior Court on assault charges stemming from the March beating of Marino D. 
Martillo of Huntington Park. Martillo was in the Maywood jail on traffic 
warrants. 
</P>
<P>
Also facing charges is Michael A. Elliott, 31, a Maywood officer who was fired 
from the force after the incident.

FATAL MOBILE-HOME FIRE STARTED IN BED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mobile-home fire that killed an elderly woman Sunday night was accidental and 
started in her bed, Orange County Fire Department officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Some sort of smoking materials in the bedding ignited the fire," said Kathleen 
Cha, a County Fire Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
The 75-year-old woman, whose name has been withheld pending notification of 
relatives, died of smoke inhalation, according to a report from Deputy Coroner 
Bill King. She was a cigarette smoker and had been suffering from an 
undetermined illness, said Leah Lindsay, a neighbor at Dana Point Marina Mobile 
Home Estates. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which started about 6:30 p.m. Sunday, began in a rear bedroom and 
quickly spread throughout the mobile home, Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim apparently became disoriented during the fire and headed toward her 
dressing room and bathroom area, where she was found on the floor, Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
"She was probably disoriented because there was no exit that way," Cha said. 
"We recommend that mobile-home owners install a back exit -- either make one 
for themselves or get one built in." 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters quickly brought the blaze under control and prevented it from 
spreading to other mobile homes in the 100-home park near Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
A dead cat, which fire officials assume belonged to the victim, was also found 
in charred remains of the home, Cha said. She added that no smoke detector was 
found in the charred home. 
</P>
<P>
"All mobile homes should have smoke detectors, particularly because of the 
materials the homes are made of," Cha said. "They are very combustible. We 
estimate it takes only three to five minutes for a mobile home to become fully 
engulfed." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay said the victim, a friend of 45 years, had lived in the park for 13 
years after moving from Toluca Lake. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of her friends had moved away," Lindsay said. "We know she had some 
brothers and nephews in Las Vegas, but we have not been able to locate them." 
</P>
<P>
The victim's recent illness had kept her at home, Lindsay said. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been ill for the past three months -- some sort of internal problem that 
the doctors have not been able to figure out," Lindsay said. "That kept her 
home and in bed quite a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay said she last saw the woman on the day of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"I took her to the store and then brought her some soup later," Lindsay said. 
"It's really tragic that it happened, especially at this time of the year." LEN

RARE PELICANS WINTERING IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
White pelicans, once a rare sight in Orange County, have become more common 
here in the last few years, according to bird experts. 
</P>
<P>
"They normally winter at the Salton Sea, but it's dying," said Louann Murray, 
research director for the Bolsa Chica Conservancy. Now the spectacular birds 
often winter in Orange County and San Diego, although they still breed at the 
Salton Sea, Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
The white pelicans first appeared at Bolsa Chica Wetlands in 1985, she said. 
White pelicans are 5-feet long with a 9-foot wingspan, the largest wingspan of 
any North American bird other than the condor, which is no longer found in the 
wild. 
</P>
<P>
Though they are in the same family as brown pelicans, white pelicans are much 
larger and hunt differently. Rather than diving for their food as brown 
pelicans do, they sit on the surface and scoop up fish with their yellow-orange 
beaks, Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, two or three white pelicans are wintering at Bolsa Chica, although 
in the past, there have been as many as nine, Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Willick, an Anaheim resident who catalogues rare bird sightings, said 
white pelicans have been seen in much higher numbers than usual throughout the 
county for the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the birds generally are found at Bolsa Chica, upper Newport 
Bay and in East Anaheim reservoirs along the Riverside Freeway, Willick said. 
Sometimes the birds are nomadic and meander around the area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Willick said he sited a flock of about 75 white pelicans last weekend in 
Anaheim and has seen groups of 100 or more for the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
The white pelicans are not the only once-rare bird to become more common in 
Orange County, Murray said. Black Skimmers, 18-inch-long birds with black tops 
and white bottoms, hatch at Bolsa Chica and winter in San Diego, she said. An 
unusual bird, the black skimmer hunts by flying over the surface of the water 
with its lower beak in the water. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hinged to snap back if they hit a snag or something so it doesn't send 
them tumbling head over heels," Murray said. "They're a really beautiful bird."

POLICE INVESTIGATE DEATH OF INFANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An 8-month-old baby's death is under investigation but appears to be the result 
of a freak accident in a highchair, Police Lt. Ed McErlain said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The child was identified by the Orange County coroner's office on Monday as 
Justin Booth. 
</P>
<P>
The baby died at 4:35 p.m. Sunday at Children's Hospital of Orange County in 
Orange, the coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
McErlain said the baby apparently became entangled in a safety strap in his 
highchair at his home on Mediterranean Drive on Saturday afternoon. The baby's 
father, who was not identified, had been in a garage workshop for about 20 
minutes, McErlain said, and came back to find the child unconscious, with his 
neck entangled in the safety strap. 
</P>
<P>
The father called the 911 emergency number and was given cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation instructions, McErlain said. Paramedics then took the baby to 
Pacifica Hospital briefly and then to Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
McErlain said police do not know how long the baby's neck was caught in the 
safety strap.

PEOPLE: LA HABRA COLLECTOR HAS A PACK OF SANTAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Claire Spothelfer admits that she is a Santa Claus addict. 
</P>
<P>
"I have absolutely no willpower when it comes to Santa," said the La Habra 
Heights woman. "I can't walk into a store without looking for a Santa. If I see 
one, I have to take it with me. I'm a Santa nut." 
</P>
<P>
Well, she's right. 
</P>
<P>
Since her early days when she was given her first Father Christmas by a 
favorite aunt, Spothelfer, 56, has accumulated 500 Santas in various forms, 
including the Santa pendant she wears around her neck the year around. 
</P>
<P>
Her Christmas tree is decorated with nothing but Santas. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, her entire house is decorated with her Santa collection during the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
"It just sort of grew like Topsy," she said. "People started giving me Santa 
for gifts and one thing led to another." 
</P>
<P>
The collection includes mugs ("I can drink from a different one every day of 
December"), plates, musical Santa dolls, wood, fabric and ceramic Santas and a 
Santa night shirt and slippers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition she has dancing Santas, Santa sheet music, nutcrackers and incense 
burners. 
</P>
<P>
Besides her cloisonne Santa pendant made in China, her other favorite is a dime 
store St. Nick with a music box that she gave to her then-5-month-old daughter 
celebrating her first Christmas. The daughter is now 27. 
</P>
<P>
Last year she didn't put her collection away until March. "My daughter told me 
I had to," she admits. 
</P>
<P>
And this year for the first time, she put her Santa collection on exhibit. It 
was shown most of December at the Whittier Historical Museum. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought anyone but my family and friends would be interested in seeing 
the collection," said the mother of two children. 
</P>
<P>
Her infatuation with Santa Claus dates back to her youth. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose as a child I looked forward to Santa Claus each year," said the 
former president of the Downey chapter of Los Angeles Childrens Hospital. "We 
had five children in our family and it was a big day for us." 
</P>
<P>
Spothelfer noted: "We had wonderful parents who didn't have much. They did 
without for themselves so the children could have a nice Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Explaining her drive to collect Santas is sometimes difficult for Spothelfer, 
who calls herself a professional volunteer for everything from the PTA to the 
major and minor charitable groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa just warms my heart, and I've always believed in Santa Claus." she said. 
"I'm just like a kid again when I see one or look at the ones I have in my 
collection." 
</P>
<P>
Although she doesn't know the value of all her Santa items, Spothelfer has 
spent lots of money developing the collection. 
</P>
<P>
She said husband Paul Spothelfer has been supportive of her habit. 
</P>
<P>
"I have my eye on a collectible Santa that costs $1,000, and I have to have a 
talk with him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers of California's Christmas Tree on the White House lawn can thank Debbie 
Morines, 30, of Garden Grove for the clever decorations which depict elementary 
school education. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great fun," said the mother of two who sells decorations she makes at 
her Happy Patch home business to 40 stores. 
</P>
<P>
She was hired by Nordstrom, which has provided the decorations for California's 
tree since 1981, to make the decorations which were shipped to Washington and 
hung by volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
The decorations, all sealed in see-through plastic spheres, consisted of school 
desks, chalk boards, school houses, school buses, tape measures and other 
school items. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get to go there and see it," moaned Morines, "and as it came closer 
to the tree lighting, I said to myself, 'Boy, would I have liked to be there.' 
"

An all-county wide receiver as a junior, Johnson became the first player in 32 
years to make the team at different positions. But his versatility isn't 
limited to football. He was the Orange County athlete of the year for 1989-90 
after earning all-league honors in football, baseball and basketball. Johnson, 
a right-hander, pitched in the Southern Section 3-A championship baseball game 
at Anaheim Stadium as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he will play football and baseball at USC. He visited Penn State 
and Notre Dame and canceled trips to Iowa and Brigham Young. He will visit USC 
on Jan. 11-12. 
</P>
<P>
"I was recruited by some great schools, but the situation at USC was the best 
for me," Johnson said. "I like the (football) coaching staff, the quarterback 
situation, their offense is similar to El Toro's, and the baseball facilities 
are great." 
</P>
<P>
Todd Marinovich could return for his junior season as USC's quarterback, but 
there has been speculation he will be available for the NFL draft in the 
spring. Also expected to return at quarterback is redshirt freshman Reggie 
Perry. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked with the coaches about the possibility of Todd turning pro, but his 
future never played a part in my decision," Johnson said. "I plan to come in 
and compete for the job. Todd is the No. 1 quarterback. The plan at this time 
is to redshirt my freshman year." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's older brother, Bret, and Marinovich played for rival schools at El 
Toro and Capistrano Valley in 1986-87 and were two of the most highly 
publicized and recruited quarterbacks in county history. 
</P>
<P>
Bret played two seasons at UCLA before transferring to Michigan State, where he 
will be eligible next season. USC will play Michigan State in the John Hancock 
Bowl on Monday, and Rob was asked which team he'll be rooting for. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm for the Trojans all the way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And the possibility of a showdown with Bret in a future Rose Bowl game? 
</P>
<P>
"That would sure give the reporters something to write about." 
</P>
<P>
As for baseball, Johnson said he spoke with USC Coach Jim Gillespie during a 
camp in Lodi last summer and figured he had a good opportunity to pitch as a 
freshman. Johnson's fastball has been clocked at 86 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to USC on a football scholarship, and I'll play baseball in the 
spring," he said. "If I'm contributing to the baseball team, I'll remain with 
the team like Rodney Peete did. If I'm not contributing, I'll move on to spring 
football." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who has a 3.4 grade-point average at El Toro, said he is undecided 
about his major. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is the second high school quarterback to commit to USC. Last week, Kyle 
Wachholtz, a 6-5, 200-pound senior from Norco High School, committed to the 
Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson is the second county player to orally commit to USC, joining Los 
Alamitos receiver Tyler Cashman. Other players who have committed early include 
running back Jeff Grenier of Fullerton (Colorado State) and offensive lineman 
Karl Schroller of Fountain Valley (UCLA).

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: RILEY CAN'T BELIEVE FUSS OVER HER 500TH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colleen Riley is in her 22nd year as coach of the Fullerton College women's 
basketball team, and she can't understand all the recognition she has been 
receiving this season. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the attention has come because of Fullerton's 80-68 victory over 
Sacramento City on Dec. 6, making Riley the first community college coach in 
the nation to win 500 women's basketball games. Fullerton is 11-2 this season, 
and Riley's record is 503-95. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, players and fans donned shirts that proclaimed No. 500 for the 
coach. When she drove home, she was greeted by Christmas lights blinking "500" 
on her garage door. 
</P>
<P>
"That was really nice and something I never expected," Riley said of the 
lights, which were set up by a neighbor. "All the attention has been very nice, 
but I never expected it." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Fullerton celebrated again. Riley was carried into the gym on 
the shoulders of Nick Fuscardo, the baseball coach, and Ken Hill, the sports 
information director, to applause from fans, players and staff members. She was 
given a plaque by Fullerton President Philip Borst and Athletic Director Hal 
Sherbeck. 
</P>
<P>
Riley is proud of her accomplishments, but is just as glad that's behind her. 
Now she can get back to coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew this would be the year of No. 500," Riley said. "But I had no idea it 
would be this big of a deal. I think I've just been lucky. I love Fullerton 
College and couldn't ask for anything more. We have had great athletes that 
wanted to win and the support of the administration from the very start." 
</P>
<P>
Riley, 48, moved with her family from Michigan to Anaheim in 1959. After her 
graduation from Anaheim High School, Riley was a multisport star at Fullerton 
College. She played volleyball, field hockey, basketball and softball and was 
on the swimming team. She earned a bachelor of arts degree from Whitter College 
and a master's degree from Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
She returned to Fullerton in 1968 to take over the women's basketball program, 
which at the time was part of the Women's Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Since the start, Riley's teams have dominated, averaging 24 victories and four 
losses and winning a state title in 1978. She has also won 15 conference 
championships and six Southern California titles. 
</P>
<P>
"We just got on a roll," Riley said. "People ask me, 'How much longer will I 
keep doing this?' And I tell them that 'As long as I need to work.' I never 
started out wanting to stay this long but I like the level. I have friends that 
are on the Division I level and the pressure is tremendous. That's not for me." 
</P>
<P>
But winning is. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton women's basketball tournament will feature a 15-team field 
including state champion Golden West and runner-up College of the Sequoias 
</P>
<P>
The tournament starts Thursday, and the title game is at 4 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton plays Centralia of Washington at 7 p.m. Thursday in the first round. 
Golden West follows at 8:45 against Coe of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Empire Conference men's and women's basketball seasons start Jan. 3. 
The first night will feature games between last season's top two teams for men 
and women. 
</P>
<P>
The Rancho Santiago men play at Cypress at 7:30 p.m. Rancho Santiago, the 
defending state champion, lost only three games last season, two to Cypress. In 
other games, Golden West is at Orange Coast, and Saddleback is at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden West women play host to Orange Coast, the second-place team in the 
conference last season, at 7:30 p.m. Fullerton is at Saddleback, and Cypress is 
at Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
Estrus Crayton, the Rancho Santiago running back and kick returner, has added 
another award to an already bursting trophy case. 
</P>
<P>
Crayton shared the state offensive player of the year award with quarterback 
Brett Salisbury of Palomar and running back Fred Bradley of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
Crayton already has been named Mission Conference Central Division offensive 
player of the year as well as a first-team J.C. Grid-Wire selection. 
</P>
<P>
Other local members of the all-state first team are: tight end Rob Coons 
(Fullerton), receiver Mike Cook (Saddleback), offensive lineman Greg Thurston 
(OCC), defensive linemen Ray Smith (Golden West) and Dave Spoolstra (Rancho 
Santiago), linebacker Kevin Ashworth (Golden West) and punter Kevin Leon 
(Fullerton). 
</P>
<P>
There was one curious omission from the state team. Lawrence Hatch, an OCC 
defensive back, had a stellar season at cornerback and as a kick returner and 
was a first-team pick by the J.C. Grid-Wire. But somehow, the J.C. Athletic 
Bureau and the state coaches' association couldn't find a spot among the 32 
players on the first-team defense. 
</P>
<P>
Hatch did make the honorable mention list, along with linebacker Eric Thomas 
(Golden West), defensive backs Bobby Sylvia (Golden West) and Michael Coe 
(Saddleback), receiver Toney Jenkins (Saddleback), offensive lineman Jerry 
Gillespie (Golden West) and quarterback Eric Robinson (Fullerton). 
</P>
<P>
Taft (8-1) won the state title with Bakersfield (10-1) finishing second. Orange 
Coast (10th) and Fullerton (17th) were the only Orange County teams in the top 
20. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Williams, an offensive lineman from Cypress High School and Cerritos 
College, has signed with the Houston. Williams, 6-foot-3, 270 pounds, was a 
J.C. Grid-Wire first-team selection as well as a Mission Conference Northern 
Division first-team pick.

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: SHAWN VILORIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
School: El Toro High 
</P>
<P>
Sport: Soccer 
</P>
<P>
Position: Midfielder 
</P>
<P>
Class: Senior 
</P>
<P>
Viloria, who was the Division 4-A offensive player of the year last season 
while leading El Toro to the 4-A title, has the Chargers (11-0) rolling again. 
She scored eight goals in three El Toro victories last week, including four in 
an 8-1 victory over Temple City in the semifinals of the Cerritos tournament 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Viloria scored El Toro's first three goals and then scored her fourth -- she 
only took six shots -- two minutes into the second half before leaving the 
game. "I yanked her after the fourth one," El Toro Coach Kerry Krause said. "I 
said, 'Enough.' " Viloria, who was voted team captain by her teammates last 
week, broke a 0-0 tie Wednesday against Agoura by scoring three goals in the 
first nine minutes of the second half. She scored on a penalty kick in a 1-0 
victory over Los Alamitos earlier Saturday in the quarterfinals. She has 16 
goals and four assists this season. 
</P>
<P>
Other top performers: 
</P>
<P>
* Melody Earle, who was named the most valuable player of the Bolsa Grande 
tournament, averaging 20.3 points for Estancia in three games. Earle scored 20 
in the final game as the Eagles defeated Trabuco Hills, 70-48, to remain 
undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
* Carrie Frederick, who was named the most valuable player of the La Quinta 
tournament after averaging 19 points in three Savanna victories. Frederick 
scored 21 points Friday in the Rebels' 62-48 victory over Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
* Lynn Murray, who scored five goals in three Esperanza soccer victories. She 
scored two in the Aztecs' 5-0 victory over Long Beach Poly and scored one and 
assisted on the other in a 2-0 victory over Canyon in the Cerritos tournament 
Saturday.

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: TES WHITLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
School: Loara High 
</P>
<P>
Sport: Basketball 
</P>
<P>
Position: Guard 
</P>
<P>
Class: Senior 
</P>
<P>
Mark Wulfemeyer, Tom Lewis and Cherokee Parks are big names in the history of 
Orange County high school basketball, but none of them have broken the county's 
80-year-old single-game scoring record, which Whitlock shattered Saturday. 
Whitlock scored 68 points -- including 40 in the first half -- in Loara's 
112-102 victory over Saddleback in a consolation game in the Irvine World News 
Tournament. Whitlock surpassed the record of Art Worthy, who scored 58 points 
in a game for Huntington Beach High in 1910. Whitlock, whose previous high was 
a 54 points against Los Alamitos last season, is averaging 37.7 points, 8.5 
rebounds and 5.5 assists this season. Loara Coach Ed Prange said Whitlock 
didn't need to be selfish to break the record. "He could have definitely scored 
more, but he was looking for his teammates," Prange said. "He passed up several 
shots." Prange continued: "I think the legend will grow and everyone is going 
to say, 'I was there.' I've already had two people come to me and say they were 
at the game and it was great. But I know they weren't because there were only 
30 people in the gym and I knew everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Other top performers: 
</P>
<P>
* Thomas Barraza, who scored 28 points for Western in a 56-48 victory over 
Cerritos in the championship of the Fullerton tournament. Barraza averaged 21 
points in the three tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
* Brandon Stott, who averaged 26 points in three games and led Brethren 
Christian to the championship of the La Sierra Academy tournament. Stott scored 
26 Thursday in Brethren's 67-58 victory over Maranatha in the championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
* Mike Tsarnas, who scored two goals for Anaheim in the Colonists' 2-0 victory 
over Orange, the No. 1-ranked team in the county, Saturday in the Orange 
tournament finals. Tsarnas also scored a goal Wednesday in a 2-0 victory over 
La Habra.

ORANGE COUNTY 1990 THE YEAR IN REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
YEAR IN REVIEW / HIGH-TECH HIGHS AND LOWS; 
</P>
<P>
EARLY PROMISE FADED WITH ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The year started out full of promise for many of Orange County's high 
technology companies, but with few exceptions, the second half was a time of 
retrenchment, restructuring, layoffs and in several cases bankruptcy. As the 
economy soured in the wake of the Iraqi invation of Kuwait on Aug. 2, many 
companies cut back on capital spending, and the technology sector suffered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mergers 
</P>
<P>
Archive Corp., maker of computer storage backup systems in Costa Mesa, 
succeeded in acquiring its archrival, Cipher Data Products in San Diego, for 
$121 million. Archive merged Cipher's operations into its own, laid off 3% of 
the combined work force, and reported a profit for its fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcies 
</P>
<P>
Charles Missler, a self-proclaimed turnaround artist, took his Phoenix Group 
International into bankruptcy proceedings in November after the company failed 
to obtain financing and execute on a highly publicized deal to sell 6 million 
computers in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Layoffs 
</P>
<P>
Parker Bertea Aerospace, a parts subsidiary of Parker Hannifin Corp. in 
Cleveland, quietly laid off 391 people in Irvine because of a downturn in 
defense spending. The cuts reduced Parker Bertea's local employment to 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Patents 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert P. Hyatt, a workaholic inventor in La Habra, won two basic patents on 
computer technology after a 20-year battle with patent examiners. One of the 
patents, which may establish Hyatt as the father of the microprocessor, could 
enable Hyatt to collect millions of dollars in royalties from the world's 
biggest semiconductor companies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Regulation 
</P>
<P>
In March, Diceon Electronics Inc. in Irvine settled charges that it violated 
environmental laws by dumping toxic wastes into the Los Angeles sewer system. 
Under the agreement, Diceon agreed to pay a $600,000 fine and was placed on 
three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expansion 
</P>
<P>
Toshiba America Information Systems, the Irvine-based subsidiary of Toshiba 
Corp., announced plans to triple its U.S. employment and double its work force 
in Irvine by 1992 as part of an accelerated plan to make its products in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relocation 
</P>
<P>
PacTel Cellular, the car phone subsidiary of Pacific Telesis Corp., said in 
November it would move its headquarters from Irvine to San Francisco as part of 
a corporate restructuring. The company said 128 jobs would be transferred as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proxy Battle 
</P>
<P>
Martin E. Tash, chairman of a New York publishing firm, led a stockholder 
revolt against Gradco Systems Inc. and its chief executive, Keith B. Stewart, 
alleging that the copier firm's top officers were benefiting from certain 
transactions at shareholder expense. The Tash group successfully unseated 
Stewart and took over Gradco in October after a three-month battle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Losing Stock . . . 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Prospects looked promising during the first half of 1990. The company's stock 
price climbed to nearly $15 a share on rumors that it had won a contract to 
build notebook computers for IBM Corp. But the stock began to slide as the 
rumor didn't materialize. It fell below $5 a share after the company announced 
lower earnings forecasts and said it would close down a computer board 
manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico.

</P>
<P>
. . . And A Winner 
</P>
<P>
AST Research Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Its fortunes in the computer industry rose despite the onset of a national 
recession. Buoyed by its penetration of the high-end personal computer market, 
aggressive pricing and an overseas expansion, it is one of the few computer 
companies that consistently outperformed Wall Street's earnings expectations 
last year. The stock rose steadily through the year from just over $10 to 
nearly $34 by late December.

Tracor Closing Santa Ana Division: Because of falling military sales, Tracor 
Holdings Inc., a military aerospace firm based in Austin, Tex., will close its 
Tracor Flight Systems Inc. division in Santa Ana and move its operations to 
other parts of the country. The move will result in layoffs of 50 to 60 workers 
in early 1991, said Marian Kelley, spokeswoman for the company. In addition, 
about 40 administrative employees will be transferred to Austin and to other

JOSEPH N. BELL: CHRISTMASES PAST AND PRESENT; 
</P>
<P>
REDEFINING OUR SENSE OF FAMILY HAS SPECIAL HOLIDAY POIGNANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lot of years ago, early in the Great Depression, my mother invited two young 
families to share Christmas dinner with us. The families' breadwinners had just 
lost their jobs in the place where my father worked. 
</P>
<P>
I remember wishing that they weren't there. It wasn't so much selfishness on my 
part as a sense that somehow they were violating a family rite. Because these 
people were not part of my family, I regarded them -- on this distant Christmas 
Day -- as interlopers. They were changing the normal flow of family events on a 
day that had been steeped in family tradition all of my young life. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to report that as the day wore on, the recognition that we were 
bringing a small measure of joy to what must have been a terribly gloomy 
holiday to our guests got through to me finally and turned this into my most 
memorable Christmas. That's not quite what happened. I remember only squalling 
babies and confusion from which I withdrew as often as possible. I was greatly 
relieved when they finally went home. 
</P>
<P>
That's not a feeling I'm proud to recall today, although I think I've finally 
kicked the guilt. But I suspect I remember that particular Christmas in such 
detail because it illustrated so vividly the very rigid and constricted sense 
of family that I embraced as a child -- and which I didn't shake off until I 
was deep into my middle years. Maybe all children build this kind of fence 
around their immediate families. And maybe it's part of the natural order of 
things to grow away from it -- if we ever do. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, Christmas -- the ultimate family holiday -- also offers the 
greatest inspiration for breaking away from this narrow sense of family. After 
all, the man whose birthday we celebrate today probably had the most expansive 
sense of family in human history, which isn't a bad model to follow. 
</P>
<P>
But old thought patterns are hard to break -- even with such a potent role 
model -- and I usually have to be prodded by circumstances to grow. 
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, I've done a lot of redefining of my sense of family. I 
have acquired a new immediate family to add to -- not replace -- the old one. 
We have been blessed to move into a neighborhood of people so supportive that 
it has all the best elements of an extended family. And we have strengthened 
bonds with friends by helping them through crises as we -- in turn -- have been 
helped. All these things have led to a greatly expanded sense of family. 
</P>
<P>
So has writing this column. It has created, rather unexpectedly, a whole new 
set of relatives. Over the three years I've ruminated twice a week in this 
space, I've made hundreds of new acquaintances and re-energized a lot of old 
ones. And, as within any family, there have been rumblings of irritation and 
sometimes violent disagreement along with the good stuff coming from people who 
have been reached, touched, irritated, enlightened or amused by the words 
written here. 
</P>
<P>
You've let me know in many evocative ways which of those buttons I may have 
pushed. Your letters, whether they agreed or disagreed with the points I made, 
have been quite remarkably reasonable and thoughtful. You've pointed out my 
mistakes patiently and sometimes with high glee. You've approached me at dozens 
of private or public gatherings to offer a handshake and a comment. And 
somewhere along the line I became aware that my family was growing. 
</P>
<P>
These thoughts, which are more easily entertained at Christmas, swept over me 
most powerfully last Sunday in a tiny, struggling church in Boulder, Colo., 
that I attended with my youngest daughter. The instrumental music ranged from a 
little girl heroically attempting her first public violin performance on "Hark, 
the Herald Angels Sing" to a professional flutist dancing through familiar 
hymns. The singing was enthusiastic and bravissimo. 
</P>
<P>
And the Christmas pageant that formed the centerpiece of the service was 
delightful. The part of the star that the wise men followed was thoughtfully 
divided among four 2-year-olds who wandered on and off the set scratching at 
the cardboard stars draped around their necks, and the role of the newborn 
Jesus was played by a real baby who handled his lines impeccably. 
</P>
<P>
I found all this warming, and although I knew none of the people in the 
congregation, I felt a strong sense of family. And from there it was easy to 
let that feeling of family wash over to the people with whom I have become 
acquainted through this column. I suppose the next obvious step is to embrace 
all humankind as family, but that's too abstract for me at this moment. I hope 
to get there one day, and I think I will. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, I just want to enjoy the expanded sense of family that is such a 
very long way from the feelings of that 10-year-old boy in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
I ache for the people who are lonely on this day and hope they may find some 
small sense of family in whatever surroundings they find themselves. I know my 
mother would have invited as many of them as she could to her table. 
</P>
<P>
I feel a great sense of gratitude to her for putting before me an example of 
Christmas generosity -- at a time when we didn't have very much either -- that 
I was unable to accept at the time but has always been there for me to draw on 
when I was ready to look. It took longer than it should, but I'm looking now. 
And the feeling is no less rewarding because it is late. 
</P>
<P>
So have a merry one -- all of you -- and maybe set an extra place at the table. 
For new family.

BREEDING BIRD: BLACK SKIMMER (RYNCHOPS NIGER) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Description: Most distinctive feature is lower mandible, which is longer than 
the upper portion (no other bird has this trait). Black back and crown contrast 
with white face and underparts. 
</P>
<P>
In winter, adults have a white collar around base of neck with duller color 
overall. Juveniles are mottled brown above. Long wings, red legs and red bill 
with black tip also stand out. Length: 18 inches. Wingspan: 44 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Habitat: Found in salt marshes, shell banks, beaches and sandbars. 
</P>
<P>
Diet: Shrimp, aquatic insects and fish. 
</P>
<P>
Displays: In courtship, male attempts to overtake female while calling; each 
male briefly passes female with wing extended. 
</P>
<P>
Nest: Scraped into mud or sand; unlined. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs: Bluish-white buff with dark brown markings; 1.3 inches long. 
</P>
<P>
Breeding-bird atlas: To report bird-breeding activity in your neighborhood, or 
to get information on the breeding-bird atlas, call Sea and Sage Chapter of the 
National Audubon Society members Sylvia Gallagher, (714) 962-8990, or Nancy 
Kenyon, (714) 786-3160. 
</P>
<P>
Notes: Lower bill grows twice as fast as upper bill to offset erosion caused by 
skimming water surface for food. Never dives for food. Skimmers are the only 
birds to close the pupil into a vertical slit. Males incubate and tend young 
more than females, but females defend from predators and feed more than males. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Map is divided into 5-kilometer squares so that Audubon Society 
volunteers can more easily survey areas on a regular basis.

Blast of trumpets. Drum roll, please. 
</P>
<P>
The year 1990 was -- ta-dah! -- a momentous one for Orange County theater. 
</P>
<P>
Sorry. Let's take that over. 
</P>
<P>
Blast of trumpets. Drum roll, please. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, with the dazzling exception of South Coast Repertory's "Man and 
Superman," 1990 was more memorable for what happened offstage than on. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year the Irvine Barclay Theatre opened and a wealthy developer gave 
a million bucks to have it named for him. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year the Grove Shakespeare Festival nearly closed and a 
less-than-wealthy woman gave 10 grand to keep it open while insisting on 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year an implacable foe of Shakespeare did not run for reelection to 
the Garden Grove City Council, cheering thousands. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year the Costa Mesa Playhouse ran into trouble with moral vigilantes 
with a decade-old play about a crazed nun that wouldn't raise an eyebrow in 
most quarters. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year the Orange County Performing Arts Center blamed its trouble at 
the box office on Saddam Hussein, the all-purpose bad guy. 
</P>
<P>

like. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year the Alternative Repertory Theatre stayed home and tried to 
recall what any audience was like. 
</P>
<P>

Again. 
</P>
<P>

38-seat theater with folding chairs. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year ART canceled a directors festival because it couldn't find 
enough directors. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year the Way Off Broadway Playhouse did more off-the-wall 
productions than anyone else, usually badly but always with spirit. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year the Laguna Playhouse stole its new executive director from the 
Grove, then learned it would lose its longtime artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year the Grove appointed an exec to replace the one it lost, then 
announced its longtime artistic director would take a "part-time" sabbatical. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year SCR lost three of its prized actors -- one had a nearly fatal 
motorcycle accident and two made a career move to Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year a major nudie revue came to the Celebrity Theatre 20 years 
after its Broadway premiere, and nobody complained. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year the Center joined forces with the La Jolla Playhouse to produce 
a musical classic, and nobody came. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year the Laguna Playhouse joined forces with Performing Arts 
magazine to produce glossier programs. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year SCR playwright Craig Lucas got rich in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year Hollywood actress Kelly McGillis got religion and joined the 
Grove board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year Brea put out a for-rent sign at the Curtis Theatre in search of 
a resident drama troupe. They're still searching. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year Saddleback College officials decided "in principle" to build a 
1,500-seat state-of-the-art theater for $10 million, but experts familiar with 
construction costs said they must have been dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year the Center said publicly what many observers have suspected all 
along: that its long-proposed, long-awaited second theater has been put on 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year the Laguna Playhouse promised to establish a second theater for 
the second year in a row, and didn't. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year the Playhouse didn't buy the General Telephone Building in 
downtown Laguna Beach, for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year the Playhouse promised a summer festival in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on stage . . . 
</P>
<P>
It was the year Clifford Odets made a comeback with "Golden Boy" at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year William Saroyan made a comeback with "The Time of Your Life" at 
Rancho Santiago College. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year George Bernard Shaw would have made a comeback at SCR with "Man 
and Superman," if he had ever gone away. 
</P>
<P>

Cleopatra" -- Shaw again. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year August Strindberg didn't make a comeback with "Miss Julie" at 
Laguna Beach's Forum Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year five Broadway stars laid an expensive egg at the Irvine 
Barclay's inaugural show, but the black-tie audience seemed not to notice. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year Shakespeare went Italian ("Much Ado About Nothing"), 
post-Industrial American ("As You Like It") and post-Napoleonic Middle Eastern 
("Othello") -- all at the Grove. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year the Center couldn't get enough of "Starlight Express," so it 
booked the show twice. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year the county couldn't get enough of "A Chorus Line." There were 
at least three productions, including the national "farewell" version. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year Martin Mirkheim couldn't get enough coke in "Search and 
Destroy" at SCR. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year of the Dust Bowl diorama -- "Holy Days," also at SCR. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year of Stephen Sondheim -- when is it not? -- with "Side by Side by 
Sondheim" at Saddleback College and "Into the Woods" at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year of Samuel Beckett, memorialized at ART and Orange Coast College 
with separate productions of "Waiting for Godot." 
</P>
<P>
It was the year of Vaclav Havel, honored only at Fullerton College with a 
staging of "Largo Desolato." 
</P>
<P>
It was the year of Helena Modjeska, exhumed in spirit at SCR with "Once in 
Arden." 
</P>
<P>
It was the year of Oscar Wilde, whose "The Importance of Being Earnest" helped 
save the Grove at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the year of Philip Larkin, although the Hull Truck Company's "Sweet 
Sorrow" tried to make it so at the Irvine Barclay. 
</P>
<P>
And, lest we forget, this column is not brought to you by the Festival of 
Britain, the combination arts festival and retail promotion that spread itself 
around the county this year like a sailor on a binge. 
</P>

IN THE END, FUNK GIVES CROWD A HOT FOOT

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It had shaped up as a classic showdown: Irresistible funk meets the immovable 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
In his first full tour since the glory days of Parliament-Funkadelic, William 
(Bootsy) Collins, the self-proclaimed No. 1 Funkateer, was faced Sunday night 
with the task of inciting a dance frenzy between the wall-to-wall tables of the 
typically stoic Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the set, Collins and his eight-piece Rubber Band had dug a 
visceral groove with blasts of spine-jarring, soulful funk, tapered with smoky 
blues ballads. But the crowd's response swelled no further than warm applause, 
scattered chants of "Boot-say" and a few sightings of gyrating torsos amid the 
seated throng. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the stops had long since been pulled: Collins and saxophonist/stage 
manager had repeatedly pleaded for action, and lead guitarist Gary (Starchild) 
Schider had stripped down to a diaper. But still, nothing. Bootsy had already 
used up his first costume of fringe, glitter and glitz and retired backstage to 
change into another. Through Round 1, the House of Stoicism had undauntingly 
prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
Upon Collins' return -- clad in a silver-studded white robe bearing the 
likeness of Casper the Friendly Ghost -- signs of activity finally began to 
surface. Upon his shedding the robe -- exposing a turquoise, black and silver 
zebra-striped outfit complete with Bootsy's usual goofy array of accessories -- 
an enthusiastic handful of fans shed their inhibitions and finally took to 
their feet. 
</P>
<P>
The epiphany followed soon after. 
</P>
<P>
During the unveiling of a new song, "Funkiest Mothers in the Universe," 
Collins, flanked by Schider and Parker, waded into the crowd -- a diverse mix 
of ages, races and styles -- slapping hands and urging them to "touch 
somebody." 
</P>
<P>
Where earlier attempts to infuse funk into some feet rang stilted and contrived 
-- such as Parker's command to "free your mind and free your (behind)!" -- this 
gesture of genuine affection shattered the barricade between artist and 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
The entire less-than-capacity crowd succumbed to dance. One patron, apparently 
inspired by Schider, dropped his pants. And a young boy wearing a Kid Frost 
T-shirt jumped on stage and displayed some appreciated moves. 
</P>
<P>
The Coach House had been overpowered by funk. 
</P>
<P>
Even after lulling back into the ballad, "I'd Rather Be With You," Bootsy's 
Rubber Band from that point forward was in command, rekindling the fervor 
repeatedly, at will. 
</P>
<P>
Although Collins has spent most of the past decade in a hiatus from music, he 
and his band proved that they could rediscover the soul of P-Funk days. 
</P>
<P>
The music has broadened only slightly from its 1970s mold, and Sunday's show 
was occasionally overridden by cliches, gimmickry and ego. But remarkably, the 
performance never hinted of the pathetic retro-endeavors common among many of 
Collins' rock and pop contemporaries who are still chugging away. 
</P>
<P>
Considered against the backdrop of 1990s music, the brand of funk Collins 
helped to forge assumes a revived relevance. By recapturing the spirit of his 
original sound, Collins' performance unearthed the influences he has drawn 
upon, as well as those he has cast forth. The playful, energized show by turns 
was reminiscent of Sly Stone, Hendrix, Prince, Living Colour, the Red Hot Chili 
Peppers and Collins' most obvious devotee, funk-satirist Blowfly. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the sonic pops from Bootsy's trademark, star-shaped, glittered 
beast of a bass, his Rubber Band mates were impressive. The horn section of 
Fred Wesley and Parker, along with backing vocalist Gary (Mudbone) Cooper, 
supplied steady doses of soul, while rhythm guitarist Mike Hampton ventured 
into intriguing dimensions of groove and feedback. Keyboardist Trey Stone and 
percussionist Roger Hampton offered steady support for Collins' rhythms, and 
Schider provided some titillating fretwork -- several ill-advised, monotonous 
solos notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
As Collins and his octet were leaving at the end of the 100-minute set, Bootsy 
led the crowd in chants of "Keep funk alive!" 
</P>
<P>
As evidenced by Sunday's victory over the reluctant crowd, Bootsy's Rubber Band 
is clearly doing its share to fulfill that aim. 
</P>
<P>
For that matter, so are the Limbomaniacs, who opened the show. The New 
York-based quartet scorched through a pulsating, eight-song set, expanding upon 
the bold rap-funk-rock hybrid staked out on its critically acclaimed debut 
album, "Stinky Grooves" (on which Collins also plays). 
</P>
<P>
Although dominated by cover tunes, including a sinewy version of "Brick House," 
the Limbomaniacs' set proved an invigorating prelude to Collins, providing 
enough punch and spark to overcome the early passivity of the audience.

Clarification: In a Dec. 16 story about a man challenging his criminal 
conviction, public defender's investigator John V. Depko told The Times that of 
2,000 cases he has worked, "this is the only one where I feel the defendant is 
innocent." Depko said he did not mean to imply that all his clients are guilty; 
only that of those convicted, he believes this one to be innocent.
