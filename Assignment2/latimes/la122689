<TEXT>
<P>
While Pittsburgh Steeler and Green Bay Packer players and their families 
watched nervously on television at home, the Minnesota Vikings decided the fate 
for all three teams, as well as that of the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings won the NFC Central title Monday night, beating Cincinnati, 29-21, 
as Rich Karlis kicked five field goals and Chris Doleman led a league-leading 
defense that produced six turnovers and barely held off a late charge by the 
Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
The victory eliminated the Bengals, the defending AFC champions, from the 
playoffs and put Pittsburgh in for the first time in five years as the second 
AFC wild card. 
</P>
<P>
The result also knocked out Green Bay, which tied Minnesota at 10-6 but was 5-3 
in the division, compared to 6-2 for Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings, who finished 8-0 at home, go on the road to play either San 
Francisco or the New York Giants in two weeks, and the Steelers, in the 
playoffs for the first time in five years, are at Houston next Sunday in the 
AFC wild-card game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great feeling, the best feeling I've had in 38 years of coaching," 
Minnesota coach Jerry Burns said. "There was a lot of pressure on us. If we had 
lost, all hell would have broken." 
</P>
<P>
Karlis had first-half field goals of 31, 37, 22, 42 and 24 yards, and Wade 
Wilson passed for 264 yards in the first two periods alone, but just 39 in the 
second half as Minnesota scored on its first five possessions, took a 22-7 
halftime lead, then let the defense take over. 
</P>
<P>
It was almost an error. 
</P>
<P>
Boomer Esiason, sacked six times, threw a 65-yard touchdown pass to Rodney 
Holman on the third play of the second half, then combined with Craig Taylor on 
an 18-yarder with 8:49 left in the game that cut it to 22-21. Esiason finished 
31 of 54 for 367 yards. 
</P>
<P>
But the Vikings came back with a 67-yard drive aided by 27 yards in penalties 
against Cincinnati to put the game away on Wilson's one-yard touchdown pass to 
backup tight end Brent Novoselsky with 4:17 left. Novoselsky, who had three 
receptions all year for 10 yards, made a diving catch in the corner over Leon 
Barker. 
</P>
<P>
The win gave Minnesota its first division title since 1980 and dropped the 
Bengals to 8-8 and into last place in the AFC Central, a division that produced 
three of the AFC's five playoff teams. 
</P>
<P>
"We played as hard and as well as we could," Bengals coach Sam Wyche said. "The 
Vikings also played well and I think they'll do well in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
The title was forged in a manner that made the Vikings a preseason favorite. 
Their league-leading defense got three sacks from Doleman and 2 1/2 by Henry 
Thomas, intercepted Esiason three times and forced three fumbles.

MORNING BRIEFING: NASTASE RETURNS HOME, FINDS AN UGLY SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Romanian tennis star Ilie Nastase says his legs shook as he watched people 
being killed by soldiers in Bucharest, Romania, last week. 
</P>
<P>
Nastase gave this account to the Sunday Telegraph after his arrival in London 
Friday: 
</P>
<P>
"On Thursday I had to go to see what was happening. I did not fight but I just 
wanted to be part of what all these people were doing. I was shocked. I saw 
people falling down as soldiers and police opened fire. Then in the evening 
they were firing on them from helicopters." 
</P>
<P>
Nastase, 43, who had "never seen a dead person in my life before," said a tank 
started firing behind him. "I wasn't a normal person, my legs were shaking, 
everything was shaking." 
</P>
<P>
At Bucharest Airport Friday, his flight was delayed because it was feared 
revolutionary forces might shoot it down, Nastase said. 
</P>
<P>
Nastase noted that while he is an officer in the Romanian army, the rank is 
merely honorary, "given to me because of my tennis playing. I don't have any 
links with them." 
</P>
<P>
Nastase, famous for his flamboyant on-court antics, won the 1972 U.S. Open and 
the 1973 French Open. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: On Dec. 26, 1955, who passed for two touchdowns and ran for two in 
the Cleveland Browns' 38-14 victory over the Rams for the NFL championship? 
</P>
<P>
There ought to be a law: The Seattle SuperSonics' Xavier McDaniel and Charles 
Oakley of the New York Knicks were fined $7,500 and suspended for one game for 
fighting last week. But the league also fined 13 players $500 each for leaving 
the bench during the brawl, which angered the Sonics' Olden Polynice. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like the refs were going to break it up," Polynice said. "Those were 
big guys out there. If we didn't break it up, those guys would still be 
fighting." 
</P>
<P>
Helping hand: After learning of an AIDS epidemic in his home of Voskresensk in 
the Soviet Union, Vancouver Canuck center Igor Larionov bought 10,000 syringes 
for its hospital, where up to a dozen patients were said to have been injected 
with the same needle. 
</P>
<P>
Canuck trainer Larry Ashley said: "It's an insight into how much Igor cares for 
his people. A gesture like this shows he has real good qualities." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Otto Graham.

NEWSWIRE: 1948 OLYMPIC SWIMMING MEDALIST RIS DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two-time Olympic gold-medal winner Walter Ris, 65, died of an apparent heart 
attack in his sleep Monday at his home in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Ris won the gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle in the 1948 London Olympics 
in 57.3 seconds, beating teammate Alan Ford by a half-second. Ris' time was an 
Olympic record that stood until 1956. 
</P>
<P>
He also anchored the 4x200 freestyle relay gold-medal winners who swam the 
event in 8 minutes 46 seconds, also then an Olympic record. 
</P>
<P>
From 1946-49, he was considered among the fastest swimmers in the world, 
winning nine national indoor championships in 100-meter and 100-yard events, 
and five consecutive national indoor Amateur Athletic Union titles. He was the 
NCAA swimmer of the year as a member of the team of the University of Iowa, 
from which he graduated in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Ris is a member of the Helms Hall of Fame and the International Swimming Hall 
of Fame. He was recently inducted into the Iowa Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
One of three brothers, he was born in Chicago on Jan. 4, 1924. His parents had 
left the Soviet Union during the Bolshevik Revolution. Fluent in Russian, he 
accompanied the Nadadores swim team of Mission Viejo on its trip to the Soviet 
Union early in this decade. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by wife, Virginia Lee Ris, sons Jeff and John Ris and daughter 
Julie Ris of Mission Viejo and son Greg Ris of Redmond, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral arrangements are pending.

As a sixth-grade teacher who has taught some of the "detestable" stories and 
poems in the "Impressions" literature series, I find the recent reactionary ban 
sweeping across our state and country to be quite hypocritical ("Are Kids Ready 
for Literature?" Part A, Dec. 13). 
</P>
<P>
Considering that 50 million illiterate adults inhabit our country, the 
publishers of the "Impressions" series should not be vilified but praised for 
trying to get reluctant readers interested and/or hooked on reading. The 
purpose of any anthology is to expose its reader to different types of 
literature. Students in my classes sample different authors and genres from 
Shel Silverstein to Shakespeare. And although their responses range from "Can 
we read some more?" to "Can we read something else?" I feel that I have 
succeeded as long as the habit of reading becomes a part of a daily routine. 
</P>
<P>
And frankly speaking, a 5-minute poem on "excreta eating pigs" or carnivorous 
witches doing damage to the children of these "concerned" parents pales in 
comparison to some of the real dangers of our educational system and society, 
such as these "involved" guardians owning televisions, cable and VCRs who will 
expose their children to more than 13,000 murders and other acts of violence by 
the time they are 12, or sending them off to school with lunch money to buy 
cafeteria food saturated in fats and carcinogens, or allowing them to live in 
an environment where breathing the air limits their lung capacity 25%. 
</P>
<P>
It is my most sincere wish that the next time these indignant parents get 
together to rally around something it will be about an issue more compelling 
than a few innocuous poems and stories.

Regarding "literature-based textbooks": Why is it that those who object to a 
few witches in children's textbooks are often the same people who have no

CHILE ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I ask that you take notice of the following factual errors in the editorial 
"But Watch It If Pinochet Grumbles" (Dec. 18). 
</P>
<P>
* President Augusto Pinochet will be the commander of the Chilean army after 
the March, 1990, transition. President-elect Patricio Aylwin will be the 
commander of the armed forces. In fact, President Pinochet has publicly 
acknowledged this relationship in the past several days. 
</P>
<P>
* The restoration of democracy in Chile, in fact, fulfills the commitment made 
by the Pinochet government in 1980. Chile's consensus for restoration of 
democracy includes a large plurality (40%-45%) who did not vote for Aylwin and 
support the conservative policies the Pinochet government has followed. For 
example, I would draw your attention to the strong showing by conservative 
candidates in congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
Your paper and others in the United States continue to look for possible 
conflict between the Chilean armed forces and the victorious political 
coalition behind Aylwin, yet fail to notice that the December elections 
represent victory for the center, not extremes. The bright future of South 
America's most prosperous free-market democracy deserves critical, but 
objective attention that acknowledges all aspects of the Chilean political 
scene.

LIFE SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The moral of the life sentence without possibility of parole given to the 
22-year-old with 5 1/2 ounces of crack seems clear (Part A, Dec. 7). Persons 
pursing criminal careers should, once they get two drug convictions, direct 
their efforts to more socially acceptable crimes, such as armed robbery or car 
theft. If this person had done either, he would be getting out in a few years.

ON SURVIVING THE MEDICARE CRUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent headline on an Economist article about Medicare in the United States 
admonished: "Better not be ill." The truth of that will become evident to most 
Americans, 65 and older, on Jan. 1 when the so-called catastrophic coverage 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
For a significant minority of seniors -- those who supported the successful 
political struggle to repeal the year-old legislation -- there will be no 
problem. These are the relatively well-off persons who already have so-called 
Medi-Gap and other insurance to cushion them against the huge expenses that 
Medicare does not cover. The congressional retreat on catastrophic relieved 
them of paying not only the premium, $5.30 a month in 1990, but also the income 
tax surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
Still at issue, of course, is the problem of protection against the ruinous 
costs of long-term nursing home care. The catastrophic bill offered only 
marginal relief to this, the most serious health finance problem for seniors. 
With repeal, most seniors will be again fully exposed to the impoverishment of 
lifetime savings that almost inevitably follows long-term illness. The 
influential U.S. Bipartisan Commission on Health Care is working on a response 
to that as part of its March report to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the new year will bring one positive development for Medicare 
beneficiaries. Tighter controls over doctors' fees for Medicare patients were 
adopted by Congress last month.The phasing in of the new system will commence 
Jan. 1, with full implementation due in five years. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most significant protections of the catastrophic legislation, now 
repealed, was its unlimited benefit covering hospitalization. Not many are 
affected. The average Medicare hospital stay is 7.5 days. But for those with 
long illnesses, the cost will once again be staggering. Under catastrophic, the 
maximum hospitalization charge in 1990 would have been $592. Without 
catastrophic, that $592 must be paid for hospitalization at the beginning of 
each 90-day benefit period, and there are no hospital benefits for a 60-day 
period between illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Skilled nursing facility benefits revert also to the old rules. Once again, a 
minimum hospital stay of three days must precede entry to a nursing facility. 
Under catastrophic, that requirement was waived and the only charge was a 
co-payment of $22.50 for each of the first eight days of the 150 days of 
skilled nursing-facility care provided per year. As of Jan. 1, coverage will be 
limited to 100 days for each benefit period, and 60 days must pass after the 
100-day benefit has been exhausted before readmission from a hospital to a 
nursing facility is permitted. Furthermore, after the first 20 days, the 
patient must pay $74 a day out of pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Gone also will be the overall cap of $1,370 a year in out-of-pocket expenses 
for doctor bills provided by the catastrophic legislation. The premium for this 
medical coverage will be $28.60 a month in 1990. The patients pays the first 
$75 of doctor bills each year and 20% of the balance of approved doctor 
charges. Also lost were the prescription drug benefits that were to have been 
phased in, as well as provisions to cover the cost of premiums for low-income 
persons to assure universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The full impact of what has been lost will be learned first in the new year by 
those struck by illness and injury requiring long hospitalizations. Their 
experience may help other Medicare beneficiaries better understand how 
vulnerable they are because of the diminished protections. That, in turn, may 
encourage a greater effort in Congress to address the health-care gaps of the 
nation as the bipartisan commission prepares its report.

THE FRIENDS OF MAYOR TOM BRADLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The late Jesse Unruh, then Speaker of the California Assembly, once called 
money "the mother's milk of politics." The metaphor is apt and, to extend it 
just a bit, political money, like milk, quickly goes sour when it is improperly 
handled. Right now, for example, there is a distinctly unpleasant odor coming 
from some of the funds Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley collected for his last 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
As reported in a series of stories this week by Times staff writers Glenn F. 
Bunting, Rich Connell, Joel Sappell and Tracy Wood, the money at issue was 
collected from the proceeds of at least 11 fund-raising carnivals staged on the 
mayor's behalf in central Los Angeles during 1987 and 1988. Profits from the 
carnivals were delivered directly to Bradley as money orders and reported by 
the mayor's campaign as anonymous donations of $100 or less. During the 
two-year period, Bradley's campaign reported gifts of less than $100 totaling 
an extraordinary $164,000. 
</P>
<P>
The carnivals from which much of this money appears to have derived seem not to 
have been clearly advertised as political fund-raising events, which the law 
requires, and in some instances were staged on city property without permits. 
The events were arranged by two Bradley supporters -- Alan E. Alevy and Mary 
Anne Singer -- who, as another Times story reported, have materially benefited 
by trading on the mayor's friendship. Alevy, who also employed Singer in her 
sometime capacity as a public relations consultant, was assisted by Bradley in 
his effort to purchase a parcel of city-owned land at a favorable price without 
competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
On a number of occasions, the mayor also has intervened to provide questionable 
favors for Singer, a contact lens technician whose ready access to the mayor 
has help her build a small public relations firm. The Times story reported that 
in 1984, for example, Bradley urged one of his investment advisers to employ 
Singer in his commodities brokerage. A year later, the mayor asked the city's 
Department of Transportation to install stop signs in front of Singer's 
residence, even though the department believed the signs were not warranted. 
Later, while Singer was living in a house owned by Dr. David Levine -- 
Bradley's personal physician and the holder of lucrative city contracts -- the 
mayor asked city inspectors to visit the home of a neighbor with whom the 
doctor was engaged in a property dispute. 
</P>
<P>
This dubious pattern of official favors rendered to personal associates is one 
of the hallmarks of the unresolved ethical crisis now afflicting the mayor's 
office. The prospect that some of these and other associates may have 
improperly raised and reported campaign funds is simply one more disturbing 
element in an increasingly unsettling picture. And it's just the kind of murky 
picture that would benefit from the adoption of the permanent ethical watchdog 
panel and hard-headed campaign finance reforms recommended in the recent report 
of the Cowan Commission.

<P>
Are our children on loan to us while in grades K-12? It seems that the state 
feels that it is the ultimate authority when our children's educational future 
is at stake. For as long as my son has been in public school, teachers and 
administrators have begged parents to become involved in the educational 
process. Well, in the Hacienda/La Puente School District, we did. We became 
involved against the system and automatically we were labeled "book-burning 
fundamentalists." Yet the group of parents who formed an efficient and 
successful organization was varied in religious affiliation and ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
Educators claim that children are bored. The question is whether reading 
curriculum is to blame or that teaching methodology is suspect. If the 
curriculum was so terrible, then I would not hold a master's degree in English. 
Neither would others of my generation be the functioning professionals they are 
today if "Dick and Jane" had not lead to a thirst for more challenging material 
-- which was always provided. That leaves the educational process itself as the 
culprit. Only the self-motivated children do well in school today. Our 
educators have failed to motivate their charges. 
</P>
<P>
Parents must share the blame, though. How much easier it is to plop down a 
preschooler in front of a TV and have letters, numbers, and concepts dance and 
sing for them. 
</P>
<P>
The article also contains comments by the publisher. I would suggest that the 
argument is totally fallacious. It is true that many of the series books have 
excerpts from classic literature. But those selections are surrounded by 
material that is neither literature nor classic. In no way are the darker (to 
be mild) selections comparable to traditional fairy tales. The material 
contained is much closer to the contemporary horror genre, in which evil 
usually triumphs., 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the challenge is not to "stop this censorship wildfire," as Michael 
Hudson contends. The "censorship wildfire" is nonexistent. True, a few "wackos" 
are burning books. But an overwhelming majority of evangelicals would be as 
appalled as I at any such action. The challenge is to raise our children to 
function and thrive with intelligence and character in a rapidly changing 
global society. In this matter, the parents are the experts.

DEVELOPMENT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A DIRTY WORD; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: PRESERVATION IS GOOD. BUT COMBINED WITH HUMAN MANAGEMENT, IT WOULD 
BE EVEN BETTER. 
</P>

By DAVID BAINBRIDGE, David Bainbridge is a restoration ecologist who has worked 
with builders, utilities and developers. He recently co-authored Sustainable 
Agriculture for California, an informational guide, published by the University 
of California.

<TEXT>
<P>
Expanding populations and increasing use of our resources will continue to 
cause ever-worsening conflicts between developers (for people) and 
preservationists (for wildlife) until we acknowledge that the interests of 
people and wildlife are ultimately the same: clean air, clean water, healthful 
food and a pleasing environment. 
</P>
<P>
This reconciliation is long overdue. The impetus for this change has come from 
the growing awareness among ecologists that human management has helped create 
and maintain many eco-systems that were once considered natural and wild. For 
example, researchers have learned that the Kayapo Indians of the Amazon gather 
trees and plants from an area as large as Western Europe to create the forest 
gardens they inhabit that produce food, medicine and building materials, among 
other things. 
</P>
<P>
It has also become clear that preservation can protect only a very small part 
of the Earth's surface. We need to manage resources more wisely to meet human 
needs, maintain habitat for wildlife and species diversity and restore areas 
that have been ruined by abuse and neglect. 
</P>
<P>
Although development has become a dirty word, it doesn't have to be. 
Development can provide benefits for both people and wildlife if it is done 
well. Recent studies of ecologically sophisticated traditional agriculture and 
agro-forestry systems from around the world have provided insight on the 
methods that can be used to combine development with conservation. The species 
diversity within some of these developed environments is remarkably high, with 
up to 250 species of trees and plants in some of the villages we have studied 
in Mexico. These man-made changes improve the environment for humans and 
wildlife, and more bird species are found in developed oases than in wild 
oases. The diversity of plant species and a more reliable food supply from 
managed landscaping can improve wildlife habitat and provide a better living 
for people. 
</P>
<P>
Developers have been crippled by a lack of information and understanding of 
resource-conserving approaches to development. While environmental issues are 
often viewed by developers as a nuisance (at best), our studies for the City of 
Davis showed that strategies for improving energy efficiency and comfort often 
reduced costs to developers. 
</P>
<P>
Development in California is destructive largely because planners, developers 
and politicians are the product of an educational system that artificially 
separates development from food production, wildlife and quality of life. 
Engineers, planners and decision-makers learn little about ecosystems 
management and resource-conserving design. Farming, which can play a positive 
role in improving the cityscape and the quality of life, has been completely 
divorced from urban development. This doesn't have to be the case. Shanghai, 
for example, still grows 80% of its food within the city, and all Chinese 
cities have forestry departments that plant and manage city trees intensively 
to provide a wide range of products for people and animals. 
</P>
<P>
Development that is good for people and the environment can be undertaken in 
the cities and suburbs of rich as well as poor countries. To meet the goal of 
long-term sustainability, development must clearly account for the short- and 
long-term cost of services and resources and make a firm commitment to both 
environmental quality and quality of life.

LOS ANGELES COUNTY'S EIGHTY-SIX CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Cecilia Rasmussen, Times Researcher 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles was the first city in the county to incorporate -- in 1850 -- with 
Diamond Bar trailing 139 years later, to become the 86th city earlier this 
year. The date next to each city reflects the year that city was incorporated. 
Here is how each was named. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura Hills (1982) -- In 1924 the town was called Independent Acres, but the 
name was later changed to Picture City in honor of Paramount Picture Corp., 
which purchased the property. The name Agoura comes from the Pierre Agoure 
family, whose ranch encompassed 16,880 acres of Rancho Las Virgenes. 
</P>
<P>
Alhambra (1903) -- Named by the city's "founding father," Benjamin D. Wilson, 
who also was known as "Don Benito." Wilson bought the land for $2.50 an acre in 
1874 from the Indian widow of landowner Hugo Reid. Wilson's daughters had been 
reading Washington Irving's "The Alhambra," about the legends of the Moorish 
palace in Spain, and suggested the name for its romantic quality. 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia (1903) -- Named by Herman J. Unruh, manager of Elias Jackson (Lucky) 
Baldwin's Rancho Santa Anita. The 8,030-acre rancho was purchased in 1875 for 
$200,000 from Harris Newmark, who had bought it a few years earlier for 
$85,000. Records are not clear, but the community may have been named for Dona 
Arcadia Bandini Stearns, regarded as one of the most beautiful belles of Los 
Angeles in the mid-1800s. 
</P>
<P>
Artesia (1959) -- In 1869, Abel Stearns, a great landowner and one-time husband 
of Dona Arcadia Bandini Stearns, sold 1,600 acres of his Rancho Los Coyotes to 
a Mr. Gridley. In 1875 the Artesia Land Co. was formed and purchased 550 acres 
of present-day Artesia. The community was so named because of its abundance of 
artesian wells. 
</P>
<P>
Avalon (1913) -- One of the first names applied to this Santa Catalina Island 
community was Roussillon Bay. In the mid-1850s, it became known as Timms 
Landing, Timms Cove and Timms Bay, reflecting the influence of Augustus W. 
Timms, a major competitor to shipping magnate Phineas Banning. In 1887, George 
R. Shatto and his wife bought the island for $200,000 and decided on the name 
Avalon because it was the legendary Elysium of King Arthur -- a Celtic paradise 
where Arthur and other heroes are taken after death. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa (1898) -- Derived from the Gabrielino Indian word asuka-gna, meaning 
"skunk hill." A nearby boom town called Gladstone -- named in 1887 after 
British statesman William Ewart Gladstone, who happened to be visiting at the 
time -- enjoyed brief prosperity before being added to Azusa's turf. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin Park (1956) -- Named for Elias Jackson (Lucky) Baldwin, owner of the 
8,030-acre Rancho Santa Anita. Lucky, whose fortune stemmed from the discovery 
of vast silver deposits, was known as a hard-headed opportunist and one of the 
biggest tycoons in the West. The city of Baldwin Park was developed around the 
Pacific Electric station, built in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
Bell (1927) -- The area was known as Obed until 1898, when James G. Bell and 
his son, Alphonzo Edward Bell, founders of the town, changed the name to match 
theirs. The Bells were prosperous farmers, cattle ranchers and developers who 
also founded Santa Fe Springs and Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
Bellflower (1957) -- Originally called Somerset, the name was changed in 1909 
by developer Frank E. Woodruff. It was suggested by William S. Gregory, who 
owned an orchard of Bellflower apple trees in the region. Early on, Bellflower 
used the slogan, "Twenty-Nine Churches, No Jails." 
</P>
<P>
Bell Gardens (1961) -- In 1930, vegetable gardens that had been developed by 
Japanese entrepreneurs were subdivided and named after nearby Bell. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills (1914) -- Oil tycoon and city founder Burton Green named this 
community after Beverly, Mass., a quaint Atlantic coast town 25 miles north of 
Boston. Green, who had read that President William Howard Taft was planning a 
vacation in the East Coast Beverly, adopted that name for his new community of 
lush parks and tree-lined streets in the hope of luring the President there. By 
1911, only six houses -- on one-acre lots -- had been built on the 4,539 acres 
of lima bean fields. Back then, the homes sold for $300 to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury (1957) -- Named for Lewis and Simona Bradbury, who moved to the San 
Gabriel Valley from Oakland for a breath of fresh air. (Lewis had severe 
asthma.) They purchased the property, once part of the original Rancho Duarte, 
at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank (1911) -- In 1867, Dr. David Burbank, a dentist from New Hampshire, 
purchased a section of Rancho Providencia from two Anglos, one of whom was 
James G. Bell, for 37 1/2 cents an acre. In 1870 Burbank bought a section of 
Rancho San Rafael. After 16 years of operating his two tracts as a sheep ranch, 
he sold the property to the Providencia Land, Water &amp; Development Co., 
which turned it into Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Carson (1968) -- Part of the Rancho San Pedro and one of the few Spanish land 
grants to remain for generations in possession of the same family -- the 
Dominguez family -- which to this day has extensive land holdings in the area. 
The community was named for George Henry Carson, who married one of Don Manuel 
Dominguez's six daughters and managed the rancho after his father-in-law's 
death. The name Carson is said to have won out over Dominguez simply because it 
was easier to spell. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos (1956) -- Part of a land grant turned over to Manuela Nieto in 1834. 
The city's name was changed on March 1, 1966, from Dairy Valley to Cerritos, 
which means "the little hills" in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont (1907) -- Henry A. Palmer, land owner and investor in the Pacific 
Land &amp; Improvement Co., a subsidiary of the Santa Fe Railroad, suggested 
the name, which also was the name of a district in Oakland, where he once 
lived. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce (1960) -- Originally known as Billy Goat Acres, the area that was 
destined to become Commerce served as an anchor station along El Camino Real 
(The King's Highway), a trail blazed by Father Junipero Serra to connect the 
missions between San Diego and Sonoma. In 1887, the Atchison, Topeka &amp; 
Santa Fe Railway built its main line in Commerce. Later, industrial leaders 
banded together with residents to encourage commerce and decided the name 
should be changed to match that goal. 
</P>
<P>
Compton (1888) -- Purchased in 1865 for 36 cents an acre by John Temple, who 
quickly unloaded it for a whopping $5 an acre to G. D. Compton, for whom it is 
now named. The original settlers in Comptonville were required to abstain from 
alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
Covina (1901) -- One theory has it that the founder of Covina, Joseph Samuel 
Phillips, who subdivided part of his 2,000-acre holdings into present-day 
Covina, gave the community its name, which translates as "cove of vineyards." 
It is said that Phillips considered that a fitting name for the region because 
it was 'cove-like' compared to the nearby mountains and had many abandoned 
vines, which had been planted by Costa Rican immigrants. But, some historians 
say the name Covina closely matches a word in the language of the Gabrielino 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Cudahy (1960) -- One square mile of Rancho San Antonio was purchased in 1906 by 
the Michael Cudahy family (of meatpacking fame). Cudahy Road was later renamed 
Atlantic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City (1917) -- Named for Harry H. Culver, a civic leader and developer 
who came from Nebraska in 1914 and subdivided part of the territory from the 
Ballona land grant. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar (1989) -- Named in 1918 by Fredrick Lewis, whose ranch was part of 
Rancho Los Nogales. Lewis used his branding iron, with its symbol of a diamond 
over a bar, to name the town. 
</P>
<P>
Downey (1956) -- In 1873, John Gately Downey, an Irish immigrant and governor 
of California from 1860 to 1862, subdivided with James McFarland a portion of 
the Santa Gertrudis rancho and gave this town his name. 
</P>
<P>
Duarte (1957) -- Andres Avelino Duarte, a Mexican army corporal, patrolled the 
San Gabriel Mission property in the 1830s as far east as the Indian village of 
San Bernardino. On each trip he stopped to water his horse at the San Gabriel 
River (where Arrow Highway is today) and became more and more enamored of a 
stretch of land west of the river bank. Duarte's petition (for what?), seeking 
almost 7,000 acres, was granted on May 10, 1841. 
</P>
<P>
El Monte (1912) -- Named Lexington in 1851 by Capt. J. A. Johnson, who hailed 
from Lexington, Ky. It was renamed in 1868 by Spanish settlers who referred to 
it as "The Monte" because of its high meadows and abundant willows. El Monte 
has since been designated as the city at the end of the Santa Fe Trail. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo (1917) -- The phrase used by a Col. Rheem to describe Standard Oil 
Co.'s second refinery, which means "the second" in Spanish. (Standard's first 
refinery in California was in Richmond.) 
</P>
<P>
Gardena (1930) -- Local legend has it that Spencer R. Thorpe, credited with 
starting the first settlement, named the town because he thought it was a 
beautiful garden spot. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (1906) -- Known as Riverdale in 1874, this community ran into an 
identity crisis early on -- the Post Office refused to recognize the name 
because there was already a Riverdale in Fresno County. At a meeting of 
settlers in 1883, Riverdale was changed to Glendale, following the proposal of 
a woman artist from Chicago. In a sense, the name is somewhat redundant since 
glen means "a narrow secluded valley" and dale also means "valley." 
</P>
<P>
Glendora (1911) -- The name was coined in 1887 by Chicago manufacturer and town 
founder George Whitcomb, who combined the term glen (to connote the adjacent 
terrain) with the last two syllables of the name of his wife: Leadora. 
</P>
<P>
Hawaiian Gardens (1964) -- Credit for naming this community belongs to an 
enterprising (but unknown) businessman who turned a bamboo shack into a 
refreshment stand at the corner of Carson and Norwalk boulevards in 1927. 
Travelers on the Santa Fe Trail often said the stand resembled a Hawaiian 
garden. The name stuck. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne (1922) -- This city received its name around 1906 after Laurine H. 
Woolwind, daughter of H. D. Harding, one of the town's founders, suggested that 
the community be named for novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
Hermosa Beach (1907) -- From the Spanish word for beautiful, the term was used 
by the Hermosa Beach Land &amp; Water Co. in 1901 to advertise the property. In 
an appeal to the more snooty settlers, Hermosa Beach used to call itself, "The 
Aristocrat of the California Beaches." 
</P>
<P>
Hidden Hills (1961) -- A 2,000-member community west of Woodland Hills, it was 
named by A. E. Hansen because the hills shield the area from nearby roads. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park (1906) -- Named in 1903 by developers E. V. Baker and A. L. 
Burbank (apparently no relation to dentist David Burbank) for Henry E. 
Huntington, promoter of most of the electric railroads in Southern California 
and best remembered as the patron of the Huntington Library and Art Gallery in 
San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
Industry (1957) -- Undeveloped land in the La Puente Valley became incorporated 
for the main purpose of industrial development. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood (1908) -- In 1887, this land was part of the Centinela and Sausal 
Redondo ranchos, of which Daniel Freeman owned about 25,000 acres. Freeman 
wanted to name the town Centinela, but he sold 11,000 acres to a land company, 
and it is said that the town was named by the sister-in-law of one of the 
promoters, N. R. Vail, who was visiting from Inglewood, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Irwindale (1957) -- Named in 1899 by a citrus grower whose last name was Irwin 
and whose daughter's name was Dale. Irwin's only claim to fame was owning the 
first gasoline pump in the area. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada Flintridge (1976) -- La Canada means valley, glen, or dell in 
Spanish. Flintridge was part of the La Canada and San Pasqual ranchos and named 
by U.S. Sen. Frank Putnam Flint in 1920 when it was subdivided. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra Heights (1978) -- Part of the La Canada del Habra land grant in 1839. 
Habra means gorge or pass, referring to the passage through the Puente Hills. 
"Heights" was added to distinguish the community behind the hills from La Habra 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
La Mirada (1960) -- A Spanish word meaning glance or gaze. The area was an 
olive grove when it was subdivided in 1953. The community incorporated as 
Mirada Hills, but the voters changed their minds -- and the name -- that same 
year. 
</P>
<P>
La Puente (1956) -- This community apparently got its name because of some 
early handiwork by members of the Gaspar de Portola expedition, which camped 
near San Jose Creek on July 30, 1769. In order to cross the creek, the group 
had to build a bridge, or puente. The construction project is mentioned in the 
early writings of the expedition. 
</P>
<P>
La Verne (1906)-Known in 1886 as Lordsburg, for real estate investor I.W.Lord, 
who laid out the town. In 1917, after Lord's death, the name was changed to La 
Verne, a French term meaning "growing green" by Mrs. L. H. Bixby, whose family 
owned a large citrus ranch.

Gunmen wearing ski masks handcuffed a couple on a street in Watts, left the 
woman behind and fatally shot the man after driving him to a remote spot in 
Compton, police said. It was one of at least 12 killings reported in the Los 
Angeles area over the holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Billy Ray Lewis, 41, carried gang tattoos, but there was no obvious 
motive for the slaying, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis was shot several times. His companion was unharmed. They were seized just 
after midnight Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
A 35-year old man whose name was being withheld pending family notification was 
fatally shot in an apparent neighbor dispute in El Sereno Christmas afternoon. 
After the victim was slain, three armed men barricaded themselves for two hours 
while the body lay on the ground between the two houses on Bohlig Road. 
</P>
<P>
The three neighbors were not booked pending questioning by Hollenbeck Division 
detectives. Police Lt. Greg Bielman said several weapons were found in one 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a dispute between neighbors until it flared into gunfire," Bielman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives had not determined what started the argument, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In other incidents, Ricardo Luiz Perez, 19; Ramon Franco, 18, and Alberto 
Delgadillo, 19, were slain Saturday in separate arguments with rival gang 
members that ended in gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
Perez was killed in Sun Valley, Franco in Pacoima and Delgadillo in El Sereno. 
</P>
<P>
Gang rivalries were also blamed for the Sunday death of an unidentified 
teen-ager on West 81st Street. 
</P>
<P>
No motive was immediately determined for the death of Abel Montelonto, 27, 
whose body was found Sunday on a sidewalk on East 22nd Street. Police said he 
may have been robbed. 
</P>
<P>
Anna Alfaro, 22, was dragged from her apartment on Hazeltine Avenue in Van Nuys 
on Sunday and fatally shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Renell Williams, a 25-year-old believed to be a gang member, was killed 
in a drive-by shooting Saturday on South Long Beach Avenue in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the unidentified body of a woman who had been shot to death was 
found hidden in bushes in an alley in Boyle Heights, and an unidentified body 
of a man was found off Placerita Canyon Road near the Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified body of a 29-year-old man turned up in the back yard of a home 
on Imperial Highway on Monday.

SILENT ACTIVISTS' MARCH DISRUPTS MAHONY MASS; 
</P>
<P>
AIDS: THIS WAS THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF PROTESTS AGAINST THE CHURCH'S STAND ON 
CONDOMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A group of 10 AIDS activists marched silently to the altar in the midst of 
Archbishop Roger M. Mahony's sermon during the Midnight Christmas Mass at St. 
Vibiana's Cathedral early Monday but then left the cathedral without further 
disruption. 
</P>
<P>
About 800 people were attending the religious service, the highlight of the 
celebration of Christmas for many Roman Catholics, when the activists, some 
wearing black T-shirts with a pink triangle and the slogan "Silence equals 
death," paraded up the center aisle. 
</P>
<P>
The action at the downtown Los Angeles cathedral was the latest in a series of 
demonstrations against the church's condemnation of the use of condoms for safe 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Los Angeles Archdiocese said church security officers were 
present during the protest, but freely allowed about 20 people who had 
participated in a larger demonstration outside to enter for the Mass. About 10 
protesters rose during the sermon, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mahony commented on the demonstration outside the cathedral by about 
50 AIDS activists and abortion rights advocates, declaring: "This isn't the 
first time the church has faced turmoil. We have been thrown to the lions in 
the early days and persecuted throughout history. This is just our turn." 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 3, four Roman Catholic churches in the Los Angeles area were spattered 
with red paint, and posters of Mahony with the word "murderer" printed in large 
letters were left at them. A group calling itself Greater Religious 
Responsibility claimed responsibility for the acts, which were denounced later 
by regional leaders of 11 religious denominations. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony said then that neither he nor the archdiocese "will be intimidated by 
threats or attacks against proclaiming the truth as God has taught." He said 
that chastity, rather than the use of condoms, is the only "morally correct and 
medically secure way" to prevent the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The AIDS group involved in the midnight Mass demonstrations was identified by 
leaders as ACT-UP LA, the Aids Coalition to Unleash Power. Helene Schpak of Los 
Angeles, a representative of the group, said: "Mahony's statements are 
murderous. The doctrine that he's preaching leaves no choice. We're here to 
tell people that they do have a choice. Safe sex (with condoms) saves lives." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if whether their protest might be considered sacrilegious, Schpak 
responded: "We're here to celebrate life also, and we believe any time is 
appropriate to protest a policy of death."

Photo, Mass ProtestA group of AIDS activists -- including Tammy Bruce, center

'PERSPECTIVE' IS A BENEFIT IN HELPING THE NEEDY 
</P>

From students and housewives to successful professionals, hundreds of Los 
Angeles residents dedicated part of their Christmas Day to doling out free 
meals and toys for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives me perspective," Clint Hodges, a trial attorney who lives in 
Brentwood, said moments before children and adults descended on the Midnight 
Mission around noon for a lunch of turkey, yams and pumpkin pie. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a white cap and apron, Hodges, 52, was one of about 100 volunteers 
who dished out food and bused tables at the Skid Row mission. In shelters, 
churches and jails throughout the city, volunteers took time from their holiday 
celebrations Monday to share goodwill and cheer with the down-and-out. 
Organizers in some places reported having to turn away volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sandy Skates, a third-year resident at the Pacific Hospital of Long Beach 
who was volunteering at the Midnight Mission for the first time, said she is 
thankful for her "good life" and wants to share her fortune with others. 
</P>
<P>
"I have food, a home, a car, family," Skates, 30, said. "And one way to keep it 
is to be of service to other people. People talk about the joy and giving of 
the Christmas season. Well, that's here." 
</P>
<P>
With Midnight Mission director Clancy Imislund serving as something of a maitre 
d', the homeless and the poor filed in past a cafeteria-style counter to 
receive their food, then sat at tables with green and red paper place mats. 
Imislund predicted more than 3,000 meals would be served by day's end. 
</P>
<P>
Imislund said he had to turn away about 150 people who offered to work because 
the volunteers outnumbered the tasks he had for them. 
</P>
<P>
At the Salvation Army in Van Nuys, Capt. John Purdell had for weeks received 
calls from people offering to help on Christmas Day. But, he said, you never 
know how many people will actually show up until the holiday comes. 
</P>
<P>
To his relief, more than 50 volunteers had crowded into the San Fernando Corps 
Community Center on Victory Boulevard by the time it opened its doors at 8 a.m. 
Donning red and white elfin hats, the volunteers distributed 10,000 toys to 
"children who Santa Claus missed," Purdell said. 
</P>
<P>
"They come down because they know there are people in worse circumstances," 
Purdell said of the good-deed-doers. "They want to reach out." 
</P>
<P>
For many of those who help, they are reminded that a simple turn in events 
might make the difference between ending up homeless and becoming successful. 
Hodges said there was a time in his youth he might have ended up on Skid Row, 
had he not been inspired to pull himself and his life together. 
</P>
<P>
"You look in the eyes of these men (who come for meals), and you say 'Merry 
Christmas,' " Hodges said. "Sometimes you see a little flicker, and sometimes 
you see dead eyes. I can identify with all of it. Then I go home to a family 
meal this afternoon, and I'm a better person for it."

TRANSIT UPDATE; 
</P>
<P>
DECISION TIME: THE FATE AND SCOPE OF A RAIL LINE IN THE VALLEY PROBABLY WILL BE 
DECIDED IN MARCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES QUINN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than three years of seemingly endless debate over where and what 
kind of mass transit line to build in the San Fernando Valley, the time for 
decision is almost at hand. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission released a 
voluminous report on alternative rail systems for the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which is building a regional network of rail lines using the 
extra half-cent sales tax that voters approved in 1980, plans to use a 
$2.1-million Environmental Impact Report as the basis for selecting a route, 
probably in March. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the long-running debate, business leaders have argued that an 
east-west line is essential to keep the Valley from bogging down in congestion 
as the Ventura Freeway and other cross-Valley arteries stagger under 
ever-increasing traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Well-organized homeowner group leaders agree that congestion relief is needed, 
but they contend that no rail line can be allowed to disturb the Valley's many 
single-family neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Most homeowner group leaders want a cross-Valley subway with no stations in 
residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
Business leaders contend that such a system would be too costly and that 
insisting on a subway at all costs would jettison the Valley's chances for 
getting any rail line. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the fighting ebbed dramatically with the emergence of a plan to 
put aside for now any hope of a cross-Valley line. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, available funds would be used to extend the downtown to North 
Hollywood Metro Rail subway west to the Sepulveda Basin. From there, commuters 
bound for the West Valley would transfer to express buses. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, drafted by state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) and Los Angeles City 
Councilman Marvin Braude, has drawn widespread support and is expected to be 
given strong consideration by the commission. It also was examined in the 
recently released report. 
</P>
<P>
* The Basics: Some questions and answers on rail systems. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What San Fernando Valley routes were studied? 
</P>
<P>
A. The report examined 10 variations on two basic routes. They are the Southern 
Pacific railroad freight right-of-way that crosses the Valley from North 
Hollywood to Warner Center parallel to Chandler and Victory boulevards, and the 
Ventura Freeway shoulder from Universal City to Warner Center. Along both 
routes, the commission studied the possibility of stopping the line for now in 
the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Besides selecting a route, will the commission make any other decisions 
affecting the Valley? 
</P>
<P>
A. Commissioners also will have to decide if the line should be a subway, in a 
shallow or deep trench, at ground level or elevated. Since tunneling costs more 
than $100 million per mile, the answer to that question will go a long way to 
determining the cost of the Valley system. The commission also will decide if 
the line should use light-rail technology similar to that used in the nearly 
completed Long Beach-Los Angeles line or heavy rail equipment like that of the 
under-construction Metro Rail subway. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is the difference between heavy and light rail? 
</P>
<P>
A. Both use the same size track, but heavy-rail systems, such as Metro Rail, 
use trains of six to nine cars, while light-rail trains seldom exceed three 
cars. Heavy rail's greater length sharply increases its carrying capacity. But 
it also means that heavy-rail stations must be correspondingly long and 
expensive. In addition, heavy-rail systems get their power from an electrified 
third rail, which means they must be completely separated from pedestrians and 
vehicles. Most light-rail lines get their power from an overhead electric line, 
which means they are cheaper to build and can travel on city streets. Rail 
experts say that the type of equipment is less important in terms of cost than 
is the question of whether the line is tunneled or ground level. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is the Valley guaranteed a rail line? 
</P>
<P>
A. Not at all. The County Transportation Commission, which has the final say on 
which routes get built, has two other proposed lines studied and ready to go 
and is scheduled to decide in March which to build. Rival routes are from 
downtown Los Angeles to Pasadena and from El Segundo north past Los Angeles 
International Airport to Marina del Rey. The Westside line would be an 
extension of the Century Freeway light-rail line that eventually will be 
extended north to Sylmar along the San Diego Freeway corridor. Commissioners 
acknowledge privately, however, that the Valley has the political clout to get 
the next rail line provided there is a consensus among local leaders on a 
preferred route. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there enough money available right now to build a Valley rail line? 
</P>
<P>
A. Not to build the kind of system that would avoid vocal opposition. The 
commission found that the cost for the 10 Valley rail alternatives ranged from 
$500 million for a ground-level light-rail line between North Hollywood and the 
Sepulveda Basin to $3.5 billion for a subway from Universal City to Warner 
Center. The Robbins-Braude plan would cost $1.3 billion, according to the 
commission's report. The commission, which has not projected spending beyond 
2000, expects to have between $600 million and $800 million available during 
the 1990s that is not already committed to the three lines under construction 
-- Metro Rail and the Long Beach and Century Freeway light-rail lines. Thus, 
almost any Valley rail alternative is not likely to be completed until well 
after 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there a possibility of more rail-building money in the 1990s? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. County transit officials might place another half-cent sales tax before 
the voters. If passed by a majority of those voting, such a measure could 
double or even quadruple -- to possibly $500 million a year -- the money 
available to build rail lines. Bond measures also have been proposed as a means 
of generating more rail-building funds. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What role does the Los Angeles City Council play in route selection? 
</P>
<P>
A. Officially, it has no role. But transit planners say that they would be 
loath to approve any project that is opposed by the council. One year ago, the 
council endorsed both routes that were studied in the newly released 
Environmental Impact Report, leaving it up to the commission to make the final 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why has the Southern Pacific Coast Line been dropped from consideration? 
</P>
<P>
A. The coast line, which crosses the Valley diagonally from Burbank Airport to 
Chatsworth, seemed to be everyone's second choice for a cross-Valley mass 
transit route, but it had no strong proponents. Eventually, it was dropped when 
rail planners determined that it would be a good candidate for a commuter rail 
line. It is under study for such a line. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is commuter rail? 
</P>
<P>
A. Unlike heavy- and light-rail lines, which require their own tracks, commuter 
lines are merely traditional-style passenger cars pulled by a traditional 
railroad engine. Because commuter trains are relatively slow and stations 
usually are far apart, carrying capacity is much less than heavy- and 
light-rail lines. On the other hand, the cost of starting up a commuter rail 
line is a fraction of light rail's cost. Commuter rail is being studied between 
Oxnard and downtown Los Angeles along the coastline, which would make at least 
four stops in the Valley in addition to Simi Valley, Moorpark and Camarillo.

MALL WILL ALTER ECONOMIES OF 2 ANTELOPE VALLEY CITIES; 
</P>
<P>
REVENUE: THE 750,000-SQUARE-FOOT SHOPPING COMPLEX IS EXPECTED TO CREATE 1,500 
JOBS AND GENERATE $200 MILLION IN SALES BY 1995. PALMDALE IS ALSO ANTICIPATING 
$2 MILLION IN SALES TAX.

<P>
With a scheduled opening just in time for the start of next year's Christmas 
shopping season, the Antelope Valley's first regional mall is taking shape on a 
stretch of once barren land in Palmdale. Yet more than just the local landscape 
is changing. 
</P>
<P>
The $75-million project, the largest in Antelope Valley history, is expected to 
sound an economic boom for Palmdale that will bring it economically closer to 
neighboring Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Delighted Palmdale officials say the mall will attract additional jobs, 
development and tax revenue for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"The new mall is going to become the No. 1 pull for shopping in the entire 
Lancaster-Palmdale area," said Chuck Linn, regional operations manager for J. 
C. Penney Co., one of the major stores coming to the mall. "We wanted to be 
part of it because of the tremendous growth in the area." 
</P>
<P>
J.C. Penney and Sears are abandoning longtime locations in downtown Lancaster 
to move to the mall. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Lancaster, with a population of about 80,000, has been the larger 
city in the Antelope Valley. But Palmdale, with about 50,000 people, has been 
catching up and the mall is expected to quicken the pace. 
</P>
<P>
Even without the mall, annual taxable retail sales in Palmdale grew a hefty 
115% between 1984 and 1988, from $91 million to $196 million. During that 
period, Lancaster's sales increased 66%, from $390 million to $648 million. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomatically named Antelope Valley Mall, scheduled to open in September, 
is expected to produce an extra $200 million in annual sales for Palmdale by 
1995. Construction on the 82-acre site began in May. City officials are already 
talking of a range of related projects, from shopping centers to hotels, that 
may follow. 
</P>
<P>
When the Sears and J.C. Penney stores move out of Lancaster they will leave 
economic gaps, officials of the larger city say. The Sears store is one of the 
city's 10 largest sales tax producers and has been in business 32 years. The 
J.C. Penney store has been in business 37 years at its current site. It will 
consolidate operations at the mall with Palmdale's J.C. Penney store, which 
will be closing after 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Sears and J.C. Penney stores will be two of four major department stores 
that will anchor the 750,000-square-foot mall. Joining them will be a San 
Bernardino-based Harris department store and a Gottschalks, the Fresno-based 
department chain's first outlet in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the project will be 125 to 130 smaller stores, a 10-screen theater 
and a food court. Developers also hope to entice restaurants and other 
businesses with 140,000 square feet ringing the mall. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's going to be one of our best. We're very optimistic," said 
Everett Shine, a vice president with Forest City Enterprises Inc., the mall's 
major developer. 
</P>
<P>
"The area is growing so fast, and we have such a captive market there," he 
said, referring to the Antelope Valley. "It has all the ingredients for a very 
successful project." 
</P>
<P>
Forest City has developed about 20 malls nationwide, including The Galleria in 
Redondo Beach, which opened in 1985, and The Mall of Victor Valley in 
Victorville, which opened in 1986. The company also owns the Park La Brea 
apartment community in the Fairfax area of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Joining Forest City in developing the Palmdale mall are East Coast builder 
George Zamias and J.C. Penney Realty. The developers plan to add three more 
major department stores in coming years, for a total project of about 1.5 
million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The economic rivalry between Lancaster and Palmdale notwithstanding, the new 
mall may be good news for residents of both cities. The Antelope Valley has had 
no comprehensive shopping area, despite its growth to nearly 200,000 people. 
When the project is completed, residents will no longer face 40-mile drives to 
the San Fernando Valley to shop at a mall. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the new Sears and J.C. Penney stores will be larger and employ 
more workers than the current stores combined. 
</P>
<P>
The mall's settling in Palmdale was the outcome of a two-year pitched battle 
between the two cities. Far more than civic pride was at stake. In addition to 
its sales tax revenue, the mall will need about 1,500 workers, making it one of 
Palmdale's largest employers. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a standing bet with my chairman that in three years the Palmdale store 
will be the No. 1 in our chain," said Robert Lawson, executive vice president 
of Gottschalks, which has most of its 23 stores in central California. Like the 
mall's other department stores, Gottschalks caters to middle-income shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale also has been gaining on Lancaster in sales tax revenue in recent 
years. Between 1984 and 1989, sales tax money going to Palmdale increased 123%, 
compared to 71% for Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Sales tax, Lancaster's top source of revenue, was $9.1 million for the 
1988-1989 fiscal year. For Palmdale, 1988-89 tax revenue amounted to nearly $3 
million, second only to the fees paid by home builders. The one-story, 
Mediterranean-style mall is expected to add more than $2 million to that 
figure, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
But the bounty won't be forthcoming right away. Because Palmdale had to issue 
$17.7 million in tax-exempt bonds to woo the project from Lancaster, paying off 
the bonds over an 18-year period will soak up most of the mall's sales tax 
revenue through the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale officials spent $12 million of the bond issue to buy a 102-acre mall 
site for the developers. In all, mall developers control 128 acres along the 
west side of the Antelope Valley Freeway north of Avenue P. The city also gave 
the developers a $2-million interest-free loan for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Until this year, the mall site was part of a long stretch of undeveloped land 
along the freeway covered by scrub brush and Joshua trees. The city is making 
the mall developers pay for about $10 million in street and public works 
improvements necessitated by the project. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, tax revenues to the city will outrun the debt, Palmdale officials 
say. And Tom Combiths, Palmdale's deputy city administrator, said the mall will 
help give the city a more stable economic base. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons for doing this is we're confident we'll have satellite 
development going in around the mall," Combiths said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials already are planning three nearby shopping centers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, at least two major hotel operators have inquired about building 
projects near the mall, said David Aaker, executive vice president of the 
Palmdale Chamber of Commerce. Aaker declined to name the companies, but added, 
"They want to be near the mall." 
</P>
<P>
Although Lancaster lost the mall project to Palmdale, its officials say the 
city is hardly standing still. Lancaster is trying to interest developers in 
building the valley's second regional mall on the 125-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
"That is my No. 1 priority," said Steve Dukett, Lancaster's redevelopment 
director. "We're not going to let the moss grow under our feet." He 
acknowledged, however, that the valley may be three to five years away from 
being able to support a second mall. 
</P>
<P>
Retail industry experts are pessimistic about Lancaster's chances of staying 
well ahead of Palmdale economically. Not only is Palmdale home to the regional 
mall, but it is 10 miles closer to Los Angeles, an important factor to incoming 
stores, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"The regional shopping center can really act as a hub," said an official with a 
major development company that competes with Forest City. 
</P>
<P>
The new Sears store, at 132,000 square feet, will be the largest in the mall. 
The J.C. Penney and Gottschalks stores will have about 115,000 square feet 
each, followed by the Harris store at 113,000 square feet. In contrast, the two 
current J.C. Penney stores total about 55,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
There is some concern that smaller businesses from Lancaster and Palmdale will 
leave existing shopping centers for the fancy new quarters. But officials in 
both cities predicted such departures will be minimal because of the mall's 
higher rents. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly cost of space in Palmdale's existing shopping centers ranges from 
85 cents to $1.40 per square foot, said Aaker of the Palmdale Chamber of 
Commerce. Rents at the mall are expected to start at about $1.40 per square 
foot and range up to several times that price. 
</P>
<P>
Forest City officials declined to provide specific lease rates for the mall, 
saying the costs will vary greatly depending on the type of store and location. 
Even so, a Forest City spokesman predicted that about 70% of the mall's stores 
will be new to the Antelope Valley.

CEMETERY OFFICIALS FEAR SURROUNDING PROJECTS WILL THREATEN SOLITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By GABE FUENTES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
As cemetery operator Jim Price looks at a grassy, oak-covered knoll overlooking 
the Valley Oaks Memorial Park in Westlake Village, he sees change. 
</P>
<P>
The 60-foot knoll belongs to a developer who gained final approval earlier this 
month for Westlake North, a large commercial and residential project bordering 
the cemetery on three sides. 
</P>
<P>
The knoll, planned for at least partial grading, is one of several aspects of 
Westlake North that has Price worried about how construction noise and changed 
landscapes will affect the cemetery, mourners and funeral services. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the 39-acre cemetery's position in the middle of the horseshoe-shaped 
Westlake North site poses the question of how a large development can 
peacefully coexist beside a cemetery. The developer says landscape screening, 
block walls and iron fences will do the trick; Price is not convinced. 
</P>
<P>
"A cemetery is a very unique piece of property," said Price, vice president of 
Pierce Bros., which owns Valley Oaks. "It's not a house. It's not an industrial 
park. There are some unique questions that need to be asked." 
</P>
<P>
Over the objections of the cemetery operators, the project was approved by the 
Westlake Village City Council earlier this month. Price said the cemetery firm 
plans to keep a close eye on Westlake North as the council reviews it as it is 
built in the coming months and years. 
</P>
<P>
"Our plans at this point are to watch very carefully the approval process" and 
"express our concerns to city officials," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very sensitive issue with a development of this size surrounding a 
cemetery," said Charles H. Fry, a representative of Westlake Village 
Associates, the builder of Westlake North. "We want to be good neighbors to 
them and respond to the privacy of people who have family members there." 
</P>
<P>
Westlake Village Associates, a firm run by Daniel K. Ludwig, plans to build 250 
condominiums and 1.4-million square feet of commercial space, including 
four-story buildings, on the vacant land north of the Ventura Freeway and east 
of Lindero Canyon Road. It would be built over 10 to 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Price acknowledged that the project site around the cemetery was zoned for a 
mixed-use project when Pierce Bros. bought the cemetery in 1978. But he said 
his main worry is construction noise, especially from the grading of the knoll. 
He had objected to the developer's earlier proposal for six-story buildings 
just south of the cemetery, and now that the heights are to be four stories, he 
said, "We'd rather see two." 
</P>
<P>
The noise, Price said, "will impede our ability to conduct dignified and 
appropriate memorial services. . . . Our concerns are mainly the privacy of the 
families that are visiting the park." 
</P>
<P>
Westlake North plans to landscape and add walls and fence-screening to shield 
the cemetery and its visitors from noise and other effects of construction. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll do everything that we can to minimize the construction impact," Fry 
said, noting that cemeteries in urban areas are not uncommon. "I don't 
anticipate that the impacts are going to be substantial." 
</P>
<P>
But Price is skeptical of whether the screening measures would work. He said 
the plan was vague about the timing of the measures and complained that the 
cemetery was not consulted by the company that prepared Westlake North's 
environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
"There's absolutely no way you're going to be able to screen and protect this 
memorial park," Price said, as he delivered an unsuccessful plea last month to 
the Westlake Village City Council for a delay in the project. 
</P>
<P>
The cemetery's engineer, Robert Levonian, told the council: "You're taking this 
beautiful, quiet and peaceful park and putting it in the middle of downtown 
Burbank." 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the project after Westlake Village Planning Director 
Robert Theobald told council members the screening and buffering could be 
required before grading would begin in areas of the project next to the 
cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Price's company already operates a cemetery in Westwood Village. "It's 
certainly unfortunate that we have high-rise buildings and that type of 
development around it, so we are more determined to see that Westlake Village 
does not turn into that type of city," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
The reason Westlake North nearly surrounds the Valley Oaks cemetery is that at 
one time, the cemetery and the project site were the same piece of property, 
owned by Ludwig, the Westlake North developer. Ludwig originally envisioned the 
entire piece of land as a 181-acre graveyard, but in the 1970s he scaled the 
cemetery down to its current size, sold it and kept the remainder for 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about development near the cemetery have been raised before. In 1979, 
businesswoman Patricia Kanan and her late sister Judy prevailed in a Los 
Angeles Superior Court lawsuit over Ludwig's shrinking of the cemetery. The 
Kanans, who had bought a family plot in 1968, said Ludwig's plans could bring 
"urban blight" to the cemetery, and they won a $1.5-million judgment against 
Ludwig's company.

appropriate memorial services," he says. The developers have promised to try to 
minimize the impact of the projects. BOB CAREY / Los Angeles Times; Map,

BRASH T. J. RODGERS TAKES ON THE CONSORTIUM CLUB; 
</P>
<P>
ENTREPRENEUR: CYPRESS SEMICONDUCTOR'S PRESIDENT IS LEADING A CRUSADE AGAINST 
U.S. MEMORIES, ONCE AGAIN DEFYING INDUSTRY GIANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sign behind T. J. Rodgers' desk reads simply: "Be reasonable, demand the 
impossible." 
</P>
<P>
But what happens when the best known of Silicon Valley's new generation of 
computer chip makers doesn't get what he wants? "Gee, I don't know," reflects 
his assistant. "It's never happened." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't happen in 1983 when Rodgers, then age 35 and with one semiconductor 
failure already under his belt, persuaded Silicon Valley's top venture 
capitalists to put up $7.5 million to back Cypress Semiconductor, another of 
his schemes to make high-performance computer chips. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't happen when Rodgers persuaded an unwilling partner to join Cypress, 
first peppering him with repeated calls, and then, when that didn't work, 
pleading with the reluctant man's wife. 
</P>
<P>
And it didn't happen when, after Rodgers finally pulled the San Jose-based 
chip-making company together in 1984, it managed to release its first batch of 
products in a near record eight months. 
</P>
<P>
Now the brash and irrepressible Rodgers, who at a boyish 41 still packs the 
precision-tuned presence of the ROTC cadet he was in college during the late 
1960s, is at it again. This time his goal is the undoing of U.S. Memories, the 
proposed chip-making cooperative organized by members of the top-tier of the 
nation's semiconductor industry to fend off Japanese competition. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a dumb plan," says Rodgers, a gap-toothed avid jogger who is president 
and chief executive of Cypress Semiconductor. "Have you ever heard of an 
American consortium that helped us? If so, I'll take 50 Amtraks." 
</P>
<P>
And it would seem that despite initial odds very much stacked against him, 
Thurman John Rodgers has a fair chance of succeeding at his latest crusade. 
Thanks in part to Rodgers' loud criticisms, U.S. Memories has failed to raise 
sufficient funds and garner new supporters, and many industry experts say it 
could die before ever getting started. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing he doesn't think he can accomplish if he puts all his talents 
behind it," says Kathleen Wright, Rodgers' ex-wife and a public health 
professor at a university in St. Louis. "He makes things happen, and he really 
believes he knows the right way and that what he does will make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Although those traits have served him well in building an aggressive, 
fast-growing and profitable company that will generate sales of more than $200 
million this year, they have also earned Rodgers the enmity of many of the 
leaders of the semiconductor industry, particularly on his home turf in the 
Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"T. J. is about as welcome in a gathering of semiconductor makers as the 
presidents of (Japanese competitors) Fujitsu or NEC," says Richard Shaffer, 
publisher of a high-technology newsletter in New York. "He has made enemies of 
his competitors. But so what? The people who don't like him are from the 
companies he is beating." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Sanford Kane, president of U.S. Memories and the man who has taken the 
full brunt of Rodgers' blows recently, has few good words for his outspoken 
opponent. "He's just a pain in the ass," Kane says. "He's a bright fellow, all 
right, but his ego is bigger than his brain." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers delights in such comments because they tell him that he's having an 
effect and that his message that big business/government industrial ventures 
aren't the right response to Japanese competition is proving nettlesome to the 
industry's old guard. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers also is not without enlightened self-interest in this matter. He is 
clearly worried that a successful U.S. Memories could end up moving into his 
markets and become a chief rival. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers in fact is seeking a license to use the same technology to produce 
4-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips that International Business 
Machines licensed last week to U.S. Memories. He met with IBM officials in 
early November and is developing a formal proposal outlining his suggestions 
for terms and conditions of a licensing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But Rodgers' critics doubt whether he has the financing or capacity to produce 
this advanced chip and note that his entrance into that business would deviate 
from his strategy of avoiding direct competition with Japanese giants in chip 
markets that require high-volume production. 
</P>
<P>
But what Rodgers wants, Rodgers usually gets, say his supporters and friends, 
including ex-wife Wright, who has known him since they were high school 
sweethearts in Oshkosh, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
He was the nose guard on the football team that went to the state championships 
and he later entered Dartmouth College in part because of his on-field 
abilities. When he graduated in 1970, Rodgers was No. 2 in his class with a 
double major in physics and chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers earned master's and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering at Stanford 
University where he studied under the late William Shockley, inventor of the 
transistor and founder of the electronics company that spawned virtually all 
the semiconductor firms that today reside in the Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he left Stanford, Rodgers had invented a patented process for 
making computer memory chips. He took his patent to a small company in San Jose 
and tried to create a business manufacturing the chips. The venture failed 
after a few years, not because the technology didn't work, but because the 
chips weren't competitive with other products then on the market. 
</P>
<P>
Although he wanted to start over with his own business at this point, Rodgers 
was told by venture capitalists to get additional seasoning. He landed at 
Advanced Micro Devices, then a fast-growing, hard-charging operation led by 
Jerry Sanders, a flamboyant entrepreneur who many believe is Rodgers' role 
model for brash, outrageous behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers left Advanced Micro Devices to organize Cypress in 1982 after being 
called by a venture capitalist doing a background check on another applicant. 
Rodgers recalls that when he was asked about the other fellow, he told the 
financier that he was the better bet. It worked. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers' initial business plan for Cypress, which is still followed to the 
letter, calls for the company to pursue a variety of specialty markets for 
semiconductors. The goal is for no single chip to account for a large 
percentage of the company's business and for Cypress to pursue only those 
markets where there is little or no direct competition from the Japanese or 
large U.S. semiconductor makers. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, and perhaps most important, Cypress makes high-performance chips 
that require less power to operate and therefore run cooler in the electronic 
devices. The technology, called CMOS for complimentary metal oxide silicon, 
allows computer manufacturers to pack more chips into a smaller space, thereby 
creating smaller, yet more powerful computers. 
</P>
<P>
The company has also been successful on the bottom line, becoming profitable 
within three years of formation and remaining so -- a remarkable achievement 
considering that the firm was formed at a time the chip industry was in a deep 
slump. For the first nine months of 1989, Cypress earned $22.6 million on 
revenues of $148.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Every semiconductor company should be run like his, bar none," says Sanford 
Robertson, president of Robertson Stephens &amp; Co., a San Francisco brokerage 
that advises Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers clearly relishes the role he has carved out for himself as a 
hard-charging, no-nonsense outsider who can succeed without special treatment 
from the government or even the support of leaders from within his own 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated invitations, Cypress has yet to join the Semiconductor 
Industry Assn., one of the chip makers' leading lobbyist groups. Says Rodgers, 
a registered Republican who's more comfortable with Libertarian political 
beliefs: "We're not club members." 
</P>
<P>
What Cypress is, he says, is a group of entrepreneurs who believe they can 
build a big business without getting trapped by the traditional trappings of 
Big Business, like the other big chip companies dotting the Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
These semiconductor industry leaders, he says, used to think like the 
entrepreneur he is. But men like Advanced Micro Devices founder Sanders, 
National Semiconductor founder Charles Sporck and Intel co-founder Robert Noyce 
are "all big company guys now," Rodgers says. "They're not entrepreneurs. They 
have a different agenda than entrepreneurs." 
</P>
<P>
Such comments obviously don't sit well among the large Silicon Valley 
companies. Executives there complain that Rodgers is biting the very hands that 
created the environment that feeds him. The large companies, they note, go 
after large markets and compete head-on with the Japanese, allowing Rodgers to 
pick off smaller niche markets where competition is less and profits often 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like the pilot fish that follows the shark," says John Greenagle, a 
spokesman for Advanced Micro Devices. "The shark makes the kill, but isn't a 
particularly neat eater so the pilot fish get the leavings. But those pilot 
fish need the shark to make the kill. It's a symbiotic relationship. Rodgers 
just doesn't recognize it, and he's attacking the very companies that make it 
possible for Cypress to exist." 
</P>
<P>
Further, Rodgers' critics question whether he is being intellectually honest 
when he criticizes big U.S. chip makers for coming in second to the Japanese, 
while offering himself up as an example of how to compete with the overseas 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
It wouldn't be the first time Rodgers has been accused of speaking out of both 
sides of his mouth. Rep. Tom Campbell (R-Palo Alto), a Rodgers' supporter, even 
concedes that Rodgers -- an ardent opponent of government intervention in 
business -- was curiously quick to ask federal authorities to prevent U.S. 
Memories from forming on grounds that it could violate antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
Intel's Noyce is quoted in a recent interview as saying that he was very much 
like Rodgers when he was in his seventh year of running his company. "His 
position is he wants to be front and center stage. I felt the same way. But T. 
J. will realize that he is dependent on the . . . industry." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Rodgers is unfazed by the criticism. "Even my friends will 
say, 'He's a cocky little guy, but he runs a good company.' "

MARKETING: LOS ANGELES IS THE NO. 1 HIT ON RADIO ADVERTISING CHARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When FM rock station KQLZ, known as Pirate Radio, broadcast ads recently for a 
Los Angeles ticket scalping agency, it received angry complaints from a few 
listeners. 
</P>
<P>
The ads were quickly killed. "Why accept a commercial if it's going to irritate 
your listeners?" posed Scott Shannon, the station's program director and drive 
time disc jockey. "If you're just doing it for the money, that's like 
prostitution." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is one of the few radio markets in the country where many 
advertisers are so eager to purchase air time that some stations can afford to 
pick and choose their sponsors. Besides the ticket scalpers it rejected, KQLZ 
routinely turns down a number of those fast-talking spots from auto insurance 
companies. The station airs only four commercials an hour, some at a charge of 
up to $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is undeniably the healthiest radio market in the U.S. today," said 
Lynn Anderson, president and general manager of one of the top-rated FM radio 
stations, KIIS, which charges up to $2,000 for some one-minute commercials. "It 
has experienced unprecedented growth for the past six to eight years. And I see 
nothing that indicates that won't continue." 
</P>
<P>
Now there's evidence that this growth will not only continue but also 
accelerate throughout the 1990s. A new study of Los Angeles radio advertisers 
spells out just how big the radio market has grown in the area -- and just who 
the big-time advertisers are here. 
</P>
<P>
The findings project that 1989 radio advertising revenues in the Los Angeles 
area could surpass $400 million. The study of more than 800 advertisers is the 
first commissioned in the radio industry. Although such studies have long been 
available for television and print advertising, they have not been done on 
radio spending until now. 
</P>
<P>
"Radio is the Rodney Dangerfield of media," said Gordon Mason, president of the 
Southern California Broadcasters Assn., which commissioned the new quarterly 
survey compiled by the North Hollywood accounting firm of Miller, Kaplan, Arase 
&amp; Co. "But in Los Angeles, the average person listens to radio at least 
four hours a day. Here, a lot of people look at radio like it's a friend." 
</P>
<P>
And the best friend of Los Angeles radio for the first nine months of 1989 was 
Anheuser-Busch Inc., which spent more than $4.2 million on radio ads in the 
Southland for its beer brands, according to George Nadel Rivin, an accountant 
with the firm that compiled the study. During the same period, Lucky Stores 
ranked second, spending upward of $3 million; GTE placed third by investing 
more than $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Radio advertising fits the life style in Southern California," said Chuck 
Fruit, vice president of corporate media at Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis. 
"People in Los Angeles seem to always be outdoors -- maybe listening to their 
radios at the beaches. Of course, that's not the case in most cities like, say, 
St. Louis, where it's 15 degrees below zero. " 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of Anheuser-Busch's radio spending in Los Angeles is pegged toward 
sponsorship of professional sports teams -- the Dodgers, Angels, Rams, Raiders, 
Lakers, Clippers and Kings. Anheuser-Busch also uses radio to target minority 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lucky says it spends more than any other Los Angeles supermarket on 
radio advertising for one reason. "A whole lot of people spend a whole lot of 
time in their cars in Southern California," said Judy Decker, communications 
manager for Lucky Stores Inc. "Radio allows us to concentrate on quickly 
promoting special prices on items." 
</P>
<P>
But unlike most cities, where food and beverage companies are the biggest radio 
advertisers, the largest advertising category in Los Angeles is auto dealers 
and manufacturers. In fact, the broadcasters association estimates that 13.3% 
of all radio advertising in Los Angeles is purchased by auto-related companies. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for radio time by car makers -- and other advertisers -- has helped 
bolster the value of local radio stations by many millions of dollars. 
Recently, KJOI sold for $79 million, quite a leap from the $18.5 million it was 
purchased for in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Price tags like that, however, are placing enormous pressures on stations to 
rank near the top in the ratings. "The cost of being in the radio business in 
Los Angeles has escalated incredibly," KIIS' Anderson said. "There is a heavy 
price to pay for playing in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Los Angeles radio market may be enjoying a heyday, executives in 
the New York market say not to count them out. "There is a general perception 
that Los Angeles is a hotter radio market than New York," said Maurie Webster, 
president of the trade group New York Market Radio Broadcasters Assn. "But if 
you take all the people in New York who listen to radio during morning drive 
time and subtracted from that all the people from Los Angeles who do the same, 
the number left over is slightly larger than the population of Detroit." 
</P>
<P>
To get that point across, the New York radio trade group recently ran an ad in 
the monthly newsletter published by the Los Angeles broadcasters group. The ad 
tried to convince advertisers that the New York radio market "outperforms" the 
Los Angeles market. 
</P>
<P>
But the radio rivals in Los Angeles laugh at all this. "New York may be No. 1 
in population," responds Mason, "but where it counts -- in the bankbook -- 
we're still No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agency Tastes Success, Lands Second Account 
</P>
<P>
Here's one agency that ended its yearlong business drought appropriately -- it 
landed a mineral water account. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell &amp; Wagman Inc., the 3-year-old Los Angeles firm that has relied 
almost exclusively on First Interstate Bancorp for its business, last week won 
the estimated $3-million to $5-million Vittel Imports account. 
</P>
<P>
"For us to be successful in the long run, we know we can't be reliant on a 
single client," said Craig Campbell, president of Campbell &amp; Wagman. About 
this time last year, the agency lost the $22-million Marshall's Department 
Store business. That left it with just one client besides First Interstate -- 
Sundale Beverages, a maker of fruit juices for children. 
</P>
<P>
Vittel -- one of the largest producers of bottled water in the world -- is a 
latecomer to the $3-billion U.S. bottled water market. Vittel Imports, which 
recently moved its North American headquarters to Newport Beach, is up against 
such giants as Perrier and Evian. 
</P>
<P>
The Vittel campaign, expected to break in February, will likely focus on the 
health benefits and good taste of the water, Campbell said. And he hopes his 
agency can use this win of Nestle-owned Vittel as a springboard for picking up 
more packaged goods clients. 
</P>
<P>
How did the agency celebrate the win? Said Campbell, "We closed down the 
switchboard and served Vittel to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Giveaway Assures That Aspen Smells of Aspen 
</P>
<P>
If you know any men living in Aspen, chances are they're smelling spiffy today. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, virtually every man living in that city -- about 4,000 or so -- was 
mailed a $14 bottle of cologne from the maker of a new men's fragrance named, 
you guessed it, Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
Behind this pungent promotion is Chicago-based Quintessence Inc., which also 
makes such fragrances as Jovan and Dare. 
</P>
<P>
Why did the fragrance company play Santa Claus? "The fact is, it's named 
Aspen," said Greta DeBofsky, vice president of public relations at 
Quintessence. "We at least wanted the people of Aspen to know about it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ad Campaign Has Even a Stone-Face Smiling 
</P>
<P>
First, there was the Prudential rock. Now, along comes the HomeFed Bank stone. 
</P>
<P>
To be precise: stone statues. And to be more precise: three giant statues that 
look like stone but are actually made from masonry. 
</P>
<P>
These colossal statues will soon appear on a TV screen near you. Behind it all 
is a $10-million campaign for the newly renamed thrift's adjustable certificate 
of deposit, which, as the commercials painstakingly point out, are not "carved 
in stone." 
</P>
<P>
If a saver buys a nine-month CD at HomeFed and the S&amp;L offers a better rate 
during that period, he or she may ask HomeFed to bump up its rate. The Los 
Angeles agency behind the campaign is Rubin Postaer &amp; Associates, which 
also creates ads for Honda. The 14-foot stone statues were created by a special 
effects firm in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
In the TV spot, one statue even appears to smile -- a stunt accomplished by two 
men hidden inside the statue who stretch its rubberized lips, said Larry 
Postaer, co-founder of Rubin Postaer. The figures are modeled after those found 
in the Easter Islands in the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the ads weren't filmed in the Easter Islands, but in Simi Valley. 
And the crew gave the three statues nicknames -- Manny, Moe and Jack -- after 
those familiar Pep Boys TV spots. 
</P>
<P>
Wondering which one is the smiling statue? Moe, of course.

JAPAN RAISES KEY INTEREST RATE TO HEAD OFF INFLATION

<P>
Japan said Monday that it was raising its key interest rate by a half 
percentage point to help prevent an upsurge in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The increase is the third this year and brings the Bank of Japan's discount 
rate to 4.25%, its highest level since early 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bank of Japan hopes that this measure will contribute to sustainable 
(economic) growth led by domestic demand while maintaining price stability," 
central bank governor Yasushi Mieno said. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who only last week questioned the need for 
an increase, welcomed the central bank's move as "timely." 
</P>
<P>
The discount rate is the rate the central bank charges commercial banks for 
loans and serves as a guide to other interest rates in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Although Japan's inflation rate of about 2.50% remains modest by international 
standards, the central bank is concerned that pressure for higher prices is 
mounting. 
</P>
<P>
The weak yen is pushing up prices of goods imported into Japan while rapid 
economic growth is aggravating labor shortages and encouraging demands for 
higher wages. 
</P>
<P>
The increase came as no surprise to financial markets following widespread 
media reports during the past week predicting the move. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen Monday morning. Share prices on the 
Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded after the rate increase was announced as 
investors worried by uncertainty over Japan's interest rate policy returned to 
the market to buy. 
</P>
<P>
"The rate has been raised and what was casting a shadow over the market has now 
vanished," said Tadashi Kawakami, senior trader at broker Merrill Lynch Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed at 142.72 yen, down 0.95 yen from Friday's close of 143.67 
yen. After opening at 142.72 yen, the currency never moved higher, changing 
hands between 141.95-142.72 yen in mixed trading. 
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues, 
which lost 175.11 points Friday, won back 383.25 points, or 0.99%, to close at 
38,423.62. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the dollar's fall followed its weakness in the New York 
market Friday, affected by factors such as the weakening U.S. economy and 
expectations of further easing of U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a sense in the market that the yen is too weak despite Japan's trade 
surplus," said a dealer at a major Japanese bank, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Another dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said there was little movement on the 
exchange market in early trading, as many overseas markets, including those in 
the United States, closed Monday for the Christmas holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's central bank seemed set to raise the rate last week but was stopped at 
the last minute by Hashimoto. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Hashimoto was apparently angry that news of the increase was 
leaked to the press before it was officially announced and so delayed the move. 
</P>
<P>
The rise in the official discount rate will be followed by an increase in 
commercial interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Long-Term Credit Bank and other major long-term credit banks said they 
would raise their long-term prime rates by 0.3 point to 6.8%, effective Jan. 4.

Boeing Delivers Last Planes of Decade: Boeing Commercial Airplanes delivered 
its final plane of the decade last week -- a 747-400 to Lufthansa German 
Airlines. The plane was turned over to Lufthansa officials at Boeing's Everett, 
Wash., facility, a company spokesman said. Earlier in the day, USAir received a 
737-400, which Boeing said was its last domestic airline delivery of the 1980s. 
Boeing said it delivered 2,370 airplanes during the decade, including 283 this 
year.

Ruling in Bhopal Case Upheld: The Indian Supreme Court upheld a law that made 
the government the sole claimant for victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas leak, a 
ruling that confirms an out-of-court settlement between India and Union Carbide 
Corp. Lawyers representing gas victims had challenged the validity of the 
out-of-court settlement, saying it denied claimants their constitutional right 
of suing the U.S.-based multinational for history's worst industrial disaster. 
Several suits were filed after the government and Union Carbide reached the 
settlement on Feb. 14. The corporation paid $470 million in exchange for an end 
to all civil and criminal proceedings.

BUYING AND SELLING U.S. LICENSES TO POLLUTE AIR; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: THE PRESIDENT'S CLEAN AIR BILL WOULD MAKE SMOG CONTROL A PROFIT 
OPPORTUNITY RATHER THAN SIMPLY A REGULATORY BURDEN.

Josh Margolis is pushing hard to close the deal. Working the telephone, he 
talks prices, wheedles a bit, pitching his product like a broker of pork 
bellies or penny stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Except the product Margolis peddles is more unusual than those -- it's a 
license to pollute the atmosphere. His firm, AER*X, brings together companies 
seeking to buy and sell government entitlements that allow them to dirty the 
air up to a point -- a valuable commodity in urban areas with strict limits on 
new sources of industrial emissions. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Margolis' matchmaking has been limited to a small class of polluters. 
But if the Bush Administration gets its way with a series of free-market 
proposals to clean up the nation's smog and acid rain, Margolis' 
Washington-based firm could be headed for the big time. 
</P>
<P>
The President's clean air bill proposes to radically restructure the way 
industrial polluters have been regulated for the past 20 years. Instead of the 
"thou shalt" system, in which industry is commanded how much to cut its 
emissions and exactly how to achieve those reductions, a system of incentives 
and deadlines would be substituted, allowing firms to select whatever methods 
they consider most cost-effective to meet general pollution goals. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the system would be something called the "emission reduction 
credit." Every ton of pollution that industry manages to cut beyond its 
assigned limit would become a marketable asset -- a credit -- to be banked for 
expansion at some later time or to be sold to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than simply a regulatory burden, pollution control would become a profit 
opportunity. And that's where Margolis comes in. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing what you can achieve if you speak to a company's bottom line," 
Margolis said. "There's water in the desert if you give someone the incentive 
to find it." 
</P>
<P>
Take the Bush proposal on acid rain. It would set annual limits on emissions of 
acid-producing pollutants by the nation's dirtiest power plants, forcing 
substantial cutbacks. But each utility would be free to choose how to achieve 
the limits. 
</P>
<P>
Those located close to supplies of low-sulfur coal in Western states, for 
example, might choose to burn the cleaner fuels. Others might choose to install 
antipollution technology. A few might decide to buy credits from more efficient 
utilities. In each case, presumably, the utility would be guided by an 
overriding principle -- to attain the necessary pollution control at the lowest 
overall cost. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone likes the notion of pollution as a property right or an asset, 
rather than a social evil to be vanquished. "It sends the wrong message," said 
Casey Padgett of Environmental Action. The patchwork of industry decisions that 
would result from such a system, he argued, could also complicate regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some industry officials fear that companies would hoard their credits 
or charge exorbitant prices for them, freezing out new competitors and creating 
monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
A dirty generating plant, for example, might reduce its emissions not only 
enough to reach its limits but also to surpass them, earning credits that could 
be traded for cash. Across town, meanwhile, an industrial competitor, such as a 
power co-generation company that sells steam captured in electricity 
production, might decide to add another facility. 
</P>
<P>
That new facility -- even if it were state-of-the-art clean -- would still add 
small amounts of new pollutants to the atmosphere and so would be required to 
buy some credits from someone. 
</P>
<P>
But the utility sitting there with extra pollution credits might refuse to 
sell, on the theory that the better strategy is to keep out a low-cost 
competitor rather than add a bit of extra cash to one quarter's bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
"It could translate into a no-growth environmental bill because utilities won't 
sell those (credits)," warned John Foster, a lawyer for several power 
co-generation companies in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is the marriage of profit and pollution control envisioned in the 
Bush bill that unites many traditionally warring parties in the clean-air 
debate and buoys prospects for its passage after 12 years of congressional 
stalemate and steadily worsening air quality. 
</P>
<P>
The free-market strategy appeals to conservative Republicans in the White House 
and Congress who want to "let industry do what industry does best -- create 
profits," said Robert Hahn, until recently senior staff economist for the 
President's Council of Economic Advisers and author of the free-market 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
And for strong clean-air advocates like Dan Dudek, an economist with the 
Environmental Defense Fund, the plan offers a promising tool to "get more stuff 
out of the air sooner." 
</P>
<P>
Dudek, who advised White House drafters of the bill, said the old regulatory 
strategy ignores how companies operate in a competitive environment and how 
they limit their pollution costs by exploiting whatever natural business 
advantages they have, such as access to particular fuels or natural resources, 
or the idiosyncrasies of a particular state's utility rate regulation. 
</P>
<P>
The old system, Dudek argued, does little to encourage initiative or innovation 
on the part of companies. "Human beings don't like being told what to do, 
especially by bureaucrats at some distant location," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dudek also makes the point that, by prescribing a specific piece of equipment 
to achieve a specific rate of plant emission, environmental laws have, up to 
now, removed the incentive to cut pollution beyond the prescribed level. 
</P>
<P>
By forcing companies to view pollution control purely as a business cost, he 
said, companies have less incentive to use it as a point of competitive 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"If we make firms take account of the atmosphere through the economic system, 
but leave them to do it, that will change behavior radically," said Dudek. "It 
gives them reason to think of environmental quality as a profit opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
The free-market ideas permeate the Bush bill. One provision is designed to cut 
smog-producing hydrocarbons by placing limits on the amount of gasoline vapors 
that escape into the air during smoggy summer months. 
</P>
<P>
Oil companies could use any mixture of fuels, including non-gasoline 
alternatives, so long as they achieved equivalent reductions of hydrocarbons. 
</P>
<P>
Another would expand the existing system of credits for extraordinary 
reductions in the six most common pollutants for which standards have been set 
by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the furthest-reaching provision is the proposed nationwide cap on 
acid-rain-causing sulfur dioxide at 1980 levels after the year 2000, the 
section of the Bush bill most dependent on the workings of a trading system. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, 107 utilities -- chiefly in the Midwest and Southeast -- 
would be allowed to generate certain levels of sulfur dioxide every year based 
on the amount of electricity they generate. Utilities would own those 
"allowances" even if they closed a plant or slashed emissions below required 
levels, and they could sell them any time after 1995. 
</P>
<P>
After the year 2000, utilities in growing areas seeking to meet increased 
electricity demand would buy them from a utility located in a slower-growing 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Such free-market approaches to regulation have been discussed for years in 
academic circles. But they found little political support because of the innate 
distrust that environmentalists had of industry and the difficulties of 
monitoring corporate performance. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1976, the concept quietly slipped through the back door of government. 
</P>
<P>
That year Paul DeFalco, the EPA's top official in California, faced a crisis. 
Los Angeles was violating nearly every standard for pollution set by the EPA. 
But companies kept pressing to move into the area to set up new plants and 
facilities or expand ones that were already there. 
</P>
<P>
The solution: DeFalco required that every ton of new pollution put into the Los 
Angeles air would have to be offset by at least a ton of reductions somewhere 
else in the region. The responsibility to find and guarantee the offset fell to 
the new polluter. 
</P>
<P>
Other polluted cities picked up the offset concept, and it soon became a 
national regulation applied to new, large industries emitting at least 100 tons 
per year of the six most common pollutants. Variations on the same regulatory 
principle have been dubbed the "bubble" policy and pollution "netting." 
</P>
<P>
In every case, the right to pollute is a marketable commodity, and while the 
traffic is confined to large polluters of just six substances, Margolis stays 
busy serving as chief broker at AER*X, the only company that trades emissions 
credits nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
AER*X, with revenue now in excess of $1 million a year, reports its volume of 
brokered trades has been growing at more than 30% a year. It has already put 
together 50 deals since 1984, usually taking a 15% commission on each trade. 
</P>
<P>
A staff of eight, including engineers, economists and a public policy 
specialist, works out of offices in downtown Washington. Another two engineers 
run the company's branch in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
AER*X attracts firms looking to buy and sell credits largely by word of mouth, 
supplemented by occasional ads in newspapers and trade journals. Once a 
potential client is identified, AER*X engineers examine the books and inspect 
plant technology to find a better way of controlling pollution. 
</P>
<P>
For sellers, it can result in more credits to offer. For buyers, it can mean 
fewer credits to pay for. "We have a real incentive to be pollution gold 
miners," said AER*X President John Palmisano. 
</P>
<P>
One of last year's clients was a large fiberglass products company in Southern 
California that cut its emissions of hydrocarbons by nearly 1,000 pounds per 
day -- a reduction of more than 50% -- by altering its manufacturing process. 
</P>
<P>
In search of a buyer, Margolis combed an official list of firms seeking to 
expand or open new facilities in the area and tapped the network of real estate 
developers, engineers and lawyers known to represent expansion-minded 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
The credits were finally sold to a sewage treatment plant for $1,250 a pound 
per day. 
</P>
<P>
Margolis was pursuing another California deal recently, cradling the phone in 
the crook of his neck as he scanned a large wall map of Los Angeles dotted by 
pastel flags-yellow for sellers, pink for buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a matter of getting these guys off the dime," he said.

PENNZOIL RHYMES ITS REASONS TO DISMISS CHEVRON SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chevron Corp. said Pennzoil Co. had hired a takeover specialist, and Pennzoil 
replied with a variation of a Christmas Eve poem Friday as the oil giants 
sparred in federal court over Pennzoil's purchase of $2.1 billion in Chevron 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson heard 90 minutes of arguments, some of 
them in rhyme, on Pennzoil's attempt to dismiss Chevron's lawsuit. The suit 
accuses Pennzoil of concealing a motive to take over Chevron, or force a 
restructuring, and seeks to require sale of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said he would rule at a later date. He already has ruled that the 
suit raises serious enough allegations to require Pennzoil to make its 
documents and executives available to Chevron, and he is to decide by Wednesday 
whether to prohibit Pennzoil from suing over the same issues anywhere else 
without court approval. 
</P>
<P>
Houston-based Pennzoil, the nation's 14th-largest oil company, disclosed two 
weeks ago that it had bought 8.8% of the stock of Chevron, the fourth-largest 
oil firm. 
</P>
<P>
Pennzoil said it was making a long-term investment for tax purposes and had no 
intention of seeking control. But Chevron, in an immediate suit, said Pennzoil 
had a history of seeking oil property and was violating federal law that 
requires advance notice and a waiting period before major stock purchases that 
seek control or a voice in management. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking to dismiss the suit, Pennzoil said Chevron had no evidence for its 
claims about Pennzoil's motives and was relying on unfounded speculation. 
Pennzoil's lawyer, Stephen Bomse, made the point in verse in his closing 
statement to Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Twas the day before Christmas and all through the court, Chevron was 
desperately seeking a tort. But they found no data, no facts they could 
mention, nothing to prove a deceptive intention. . . . Who cares if all that we 
have is suspicion? We'll tell 'em it's true, based on our intuition.' " 
</P>
<P>
"This discussion," Bomse said more prosaically, "belongs not in a courtroom but 
on an analyst's couch." 
</P>
<P>
But Chevron's lawyer, Walter Robinson, said the company had reasons for its 
suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he said, Pennzoil needs to buy more Chevron stock to get the 
$800-million tax break it says it is after -- enough to put it over the 10% 
ownership threshold that would trigger Chevron's "shareholder-rights" plan, one 
of several anti-takeover measures Chevron has newly instituted. Among other 
things, Chevron's suit seeks a declaration that those measures are legal. 
</P>
<P>
Also, according to a declaration filed with the court on Dec. 7, the same day 
Chevron filed suit, an investment banker working for Chevron said he got a call 
from Felix Rohatyn, a prominent mergers and acquisitions expert at the 
investment firm of Lazard Freres, who said he was representing Pennzoil. 
</P>
<P>
"They're hiring a $6-million man to help them, a man who specializes in 
mergers," Robinson said, referring to the amount Rohatyn reportedly made in 
1987. " . . . The threat is real." 
</P>
<P>
Bomse told reporters that he didn't know whether Rohatyn was still involved 
with Pennzoil, but he certainly wasn't representing Pennzoil during the stock 
purchases, at the time the suit was filed, or as recently as a few days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the lawyer asked Henderson, "is there something now sinister, even if 
it were true, about retaining an investment banker?" 
</P>
<P>
Bomse also said there was no need for Henderson to decide the validity of 
Chevron's defensive maneuvers, such as the shareholder-rights plan, because 
they are already being challenged in five stockholder suits in Delaware, where 
the two companies are incorporated, and California. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson said Pennzoil has already criticized Chevron's measures as an 
attempt to entrench company management and would inevitably challenge them in 
court.

GROUP INCREASES ITS STAKE IN AVON TO 8.7%, MAY BE READY TO BUY MORE

A group of powerful investors, including oil fortune heir Gordon P. Getty, 
increased its stake Friday in Avon Products Inc. to 8.7% and extended its 
credit agreement with several banks. 
</P>
<P>
Chartwell Associates, a limited partnership, said in a Securities and Exchange 
Commission filing that it paid $14.5 million to purchase 401,000 more shares of 
Avon common stock between Dec. 1 and last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The stock, purchased for between $35.25 and $36.625 per share, increased 
Chartwell's holdings to 4.9 million shares for a total of $166.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC filing said the partnership has extended its credit agreement so it can 
continue borrowing until Jan. 31, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Avon, a New York-based cosmetics company, has twice rejected takeover proposals 
earlier this year and fended off takeover feelers from Dallas-based Mary Kay 
Corp., the privately held parent of door-to-door marketer Mary Kay Cosmetics. 
</P>
<P>
A subsidiary of Mary Kay is among the general partners of Chartwell, which also 
include the Gordon P. Getty Family Trust and the Fisher real estate family of 
New York.

FIRM DRAWN INTO DISPUTE OVER COMPUTER IMAGING; 
</P>
<P>
PATENTS: NEW IMAGE LETS COMPANIES GIVE A PREVIEW OF THEIR WORK. BUT A RIVAL 
FIRM PLANS TO SUE OVER RIGHTS TO THE SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One recent day at the Michael Berg Beauty Salon in Encino, Catalina Ramirez 
looked into a computer screen and liked what she saw. For a $35 fee, a 
hairstylist was using a computer imaging device called the New Image Salon 
System to show Ramirez a video picture of what she would look like if she tried 
a couple of new hairdos. 
</P>
<P>
Holding a lock of her reddish-brown, shoulder-length hair, Ramirez said: "Than 
this, anything is better." But she wasn't about to leap into a new hairstyle 
without a preview and some coaxing. 
</P>
<P>
"You look like Meryl Streep there," urged stylist Mia Bakewell, pointing to an 
image of Ramirez with dark brown hair in a "layered bob" cut. "I'm serious. You 
have similar bone structure." 
</P>
<P>
For Ramirez, it was a sale. She was hooked by Streep's bones, the new cut, and 
the computer system. "It's really fabulous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some investors have been just as easily charmed by New Image Industries Inc., 
the company that makes the salon system, and several other computer-imaging 
systems for landscapers, builders, cosmetic surgeons and weight-loss clinics. 
New Image's stock has soared after it went public in August, from an offering 
price of $6.50 to about $11 recently. 
</P>
<P>
Based on results for the company's fiscal year that ended June 30 -- when 
profits increased nearly twenty-fold to $804,000 -- the latest stock price runs 
about 30 times annual earnings-per-share, or better than double the average on 
Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
New Image has been profitable since it incorporated in February, 1987. Indeed, 
in the most recent quarter that ended Sept. 30, profits tripled to $229,000 
from the same period a year before. Sales, meanwhile, increased 36% to $2.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
And some forecasts for the company are rosy, because it's selling more and more 
hairdressers on their computer system. Richard Edelman, senior vice president 
of research for Southwest Securities in Dallas, predicts that New Image's 
profits will increase 50% to 100% each year for the next three years. New Image 
chief executive Robert Gurevitch says if all goes according to plan, the 
company will sell computer systems to 10% of the nation's 250,000 salons within 
about two to four years. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the company's fast start, it still has much to worry about. 
Gurevitch's long-term sales goal is a huge jump from the approximately 600 to 
700 computer units the company has sold thus far in the United States. To meet 
that goal, New Image will have to increase its staff dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
New Image also has to worry about a patent dispute with a rival company, a 
Florida firm called Combputer Images. So far, Combputer Images doesn't look 
like a fierce competitor, posting a loss of about $36,000 on sales of about 
$30,000 for the six months ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
But Combputer Images "intends to file suit very shortly" against New Image, 
said president Alex Grief. The Florida company has two patents that cover the 
idea of using computers and video equipment to preview hairstyles, Grief said. 
Combputer Images is in the midst of a $1.4-million public stock offering and 
the money should give the company the funds it needs to launch a legal 
campaign. "Right is right," said Grief. "We obtained the patents." 
</P>
<P>
Gurevitch counters that Combputer Images doesn't have a case, arguing Combputer 
Images' patents are so narrow that New Image's equipment doesn't infringe on 
them. And Gurevitch asserted that his lawyers say Combputer Images' patents 
aren't valid anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Still, if Combputer Images sues and wins, New Image could be forced out of its 
most lucrative market -- beauty parlor sales, which accounted for 73% of New 
Image's revenues in its latest fiscal year, or it might be forced to pay the 
Florida company under a licensing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that the computer-imaging field is crowded with young 
companies, said Richard Schwarz, an industry analyst with Shearson Lehman 
Hutton in New York. Schwarz said he has not followed New Image closely, but 
said he has files on nearly 1,000 companies making a variety of 
computer-imaging systems -- including one to help police departments 
reconstruct criminals' faces. A number of those firms have already failed, 
Schwarz said. 
</P>
<P>
There's also the question of just how many beauticians, builders and others 
will pay the $10,000 to $22,000 it costs for a New Image system. Gurevitch said 
it's not so tough to persuade builders and landscapers -- who can earn back the 
price of a machines in just a few jobs -- to buy one. But with beauticians, who 
use the equipment to push $50 perms, it's a more difficult sell, he admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone salespeople in Canoga Park now sell most of New Image's computer 
systems, but the company recently opened sales offices in Chicago, Miami and 
Westport, Conn. Virtually all of New Image's sales are made with leasing deals, 
so buyers can get their payments down to a couple of hundred dollars a month. 
</P>
<P>
Under its ambitious expansion plans, New Image plans to open as many as three 
more sales offices, and to meet Gurevitch's lofty sales predictions, New Image 
must also hire plenty of competent middle managers and stay ahead of burgeoning 
cash and capital needs. Thanks to its stock offering, however, the company has 
had about $4.4 million in cash as of Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
But, said analyst Edeleman: "The risk is always that they will grow too fast 
and lose control internally." 
</P>
<P>
New Image was formed in 1986 when Kirk La Mar, a Woodland Hills beauty parlor 
owner, teamed up with one of his customers, John Halloran, a computer-imaging 
consultant for Lockheed. Halloran and La Mar borrowed about $10,000, and 
invested $15,000 of their own money to build an experimental model of the Salon 
System. Their first buyer was a salon owner who saw them on a local cable 
television program. When the two incorporated New Image in 1987, they brought 
in Gurevitch, a former executive with Gillette and Revlon who was then the 
chief executive of a sportswear company. 
</P>
<P>
New Image makes no computer hardware -- it simply repackages computer equipment 
with its own software and a kind of pictorial glossary. A stylist aims a video 
camera at a client and the computer records the client's face. Then the 
computer can replace the image of the client's hair with one of the hairstyles 
loaded into its memory. 
</P>
<P>
It's a tool for marketing to the cautious -- or as Encino beauty parlor owner 
Michael Berg calls them, "the glamour resistant." Said Berg: "They're afraid of 
change. They want to say, 'show me.' " 
</P>
<P>
New Image also makes systems for builders, landscape designers and weight-loss 
clinics. And since buying McGhan InstruMed Corp. of Carpinteria last month for 
about $200,000, New Image has been in the business of selling similar computer 
systems to cosmetic surgeons too. 
</P>
<P>
The company has been helped by a flood of publicity -- mostly centered around 
the beauty shop systems. New Image has been featured in 750 newspaper and 
magazine articles, and La Mar has put in 30 television appearances touting the 
computer device. But when La Mar appeared on "Late Night with David Letterman" 
in August, 1988, his usual TV game plan didn't work. Letterman's first comment, 
according to La Mar, was " 'You look like you manage wrestlers.' " 
</P>
<P>
Wrestling with the company's growth will be his next task.

THE QUESTION AT SUNKIST: IS FLORIDA RIPE FOR EXPANSION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MEDEARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sunkist Growers Inc., the citrus farmers' cooperative whose well-known 
trademark has made it a dominant force among Arizona and California growers, is 
considering expanding into Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The Sherman Oaks-based cooperative is thinking about selling fruit from Florida 
because there's little chance of expanding citrus production in Arizona and 
California due to urban encroachment on citrus groves and the skyrocketing 
costs of water in the southwest. Florida remains the state with the largest 
citrus crop. 
</P>
<P>
The cooperative, projected to do nearly $1 billion in sales in 1989, has sent 
three teams of executives and directors to Florida to talk with growers and 
packers of lemons, tangerines and grapefruit. A fourth team in January will 
visit the state to talk with orange growers. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunkist officials stressed that they haven't yet decided whether to expand 
to Florida. "We don't have a consensus even among our current members," said 
Russell L. Hanlin, president of Sunkist. "It's too early even to put the 
question to them." The cooperative may make a decision next summer, said Curtis 
W. Anderson, vice president of member and public relations. 
</P>
<P>
Sunkist is a grower-owned cooperative of about 6,000 citrus farmers in Arizona 
and California, who account for about 65% of citrus fruit production in the two 
states. The cooperative packs the growers' fruit, advertises and sells it, then 
pays the growers most of the proceeds back, minus a fee. For the growers it 
saves them the worry of actually marketing their fruit. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, when Sunkist had revenues of about $887 million, it returned about 
$640 million to members, and after Sunkist's costs of $241 million, the 
cooperative's retained income was $6 million before taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The cooperative is best known for its sales of fresh fruit under the Sunkist 
name, coined by ad men in 1909. But it also was paid about $10 million in 1988 
under licensing agreements that allow other companies to use the name. Cadbury 
Schweppes Inc., for example, sells Sunkist orange drink. 
</P>
<P>
If Sunkist decides to sell Florida fruit, it would probably not seek new 
members there, at least early on. The cooperative would simply charge a fee to 
market the citrus and then plow back the profits from selling Florida fruit to 
reduce fees for its California and Arizona growers. It could later seek members 
in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The impetus for expanding comes from a need to keep pace with the recent 
consolidations of grocery chains. "We don't want to be whip-sawed simply by the 
disparity in size between the buyer and the seller," Hanlin said. As the market 
chains get bigger they demand lower prices and a more consistent supply of 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>
With 33 sales offices throughout North America, Anderson said, Sunkist has 
plenty of excess capacity to market more fruit without spending more money. 
</P>
<P>
But California and Arizona -- despite their size -- don't have much room left 
for new citrus groves. The two states have lost about 40,000 acres of 
citrus-growing land in the last five to eight years, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the high cost of water where there is room to expand -- in places 
like the eastern San Joaquin Valley -- makes it unlikely that citrus production 
throughout Arizona and California will do more than level out in the next few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, it's a different story. Although the state lost more than 200,000 
acres of citrus groves as a result of freezes in 1983 and 1985, new groves are 
being planted, especially in southern Florida. Hanlin said, "We believe as the 
Florida crop grows they're going to need some additions to their marketing 
facilities." 
</P>
<P>
What does Florida think about Sunkist's idea? 
</P>
<P>
"The citrus industry is growing and there's room for everybody," said Cathy 
Clay, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Citrus, which levies a fee on 
growers and spends about $77 million a year advertising the state's fruit. 
Florida does have some citrus cooperatives, but none on a scale to match 
Sunkist. 
</P>
<P>
Although 94% of Florida-grown oranges and about 57% of its grapefruit wind up 
as juice, rather than sold fresh in grocery stores, Sunkist would concentrate 
on marketing Florida fruit fresh. That would reflect the cooperative's current 
emphasis; about 70% of California and Arizona fruit is sold whole. 
</P>
<P>
Florida's humidity helps produce juicier oranges than those typically grown 
here. By comparison, cool nights in California and Arizona make for 
better-looking fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the difference in emphasis, there's still a substantial amount of fresh 
Florida fruit to be sold. In the 1987-88 season, Florida produced about 46 
million cartons of grapefruit for sale fresh compared to California and 
Arizona's 14 million.

ROCKETDYNE'S THRUST IS NEW PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the new president of Rocketdyne, the rocket engine division of Rockwell 
International that builds the main engines for the space shuttles, Robert D. 
Paster would seem to have inherited a rock solid business. 
</P>
<P>
Rocketdyne's order backlog this year alone jumped $500 million, to $3 billion, 
and its 1989 sales topped $1 billion for the first time. The division, which 
first set up shop in the San Fernando Valley in the early 1950s and is now 
based in Canoga Park, counts 9,500 employees and expects to add 500 workers 
next year. All this comes at a time when other aerospace companies are slashing 
their work forces. 
</P>
<P>
Rocketdyne's advantage is that 75% of its business is so-called "commercial 
work," such as the NASA-operated shuttle, and has been exempt thus far from the 
defense spending slowdown that is forcing other companies to cut employment. 
"We're not in the tank business, we're in the business of space systems," said 
Paster, who became president in October. 
</P>
<P>
While federal spending for some defense programs is being cut, spending for 
space programs jumped 16% in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, to $12.4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
But Paster, 49, feels pressure anyway. He can't count on similar spending gains 
for space in the future because budget deficit problems could pare funding for 
Rocketdyne's pet projects. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Rocketdyne has built engines for every space shuttle. But even 
that could change one day. Three years ago, NASA awarded a $198-million 
contract to Pratt &amp; Whitney to develop a new turbopump for the shuttle's 
main engines, that is, a pump that would outperform the current one built by 
Rocketdyne. (The pump forces fuel through the engine at high speed.) Pratt 
&amp; Whitney, a unit of United Technologies, is about to begin testing its 
version of the product. 
</P>
<P>
The contract signaled that Rocketdyne could not take the shuttle engine program 
for granted, said Wolfgang H. Demisch, an aerospace analyst for UBS Securities 
in New York. "Clearly there will be more competition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Rocketdyne is not totally exempt from defense spending cutbacks because 
the military is a major user of the rockets that Rocketdyne designs engines 
for, said Paul H. Nisbet, an aerospace analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities 
in New York. "The 'commercial programs,' as they are called, are largely 
supported by the military," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So Paster's task is to secure more new projects -- and keep those it already 
has -- so that Rocketdyne maintains its momentum. "We may not grow as fast as 
we want to grow, but I don't see us going into a decay unless something 
unforeseen happens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
To land contracts, he must deliver current orders as promised -- correctly 
built, on time and within budget. Otherwise, Rocketdyne risks jeopardizing the 
willingness of Congress and the public to continue paying for the projects. 
</P>
<P>
For example, one of Rocketdyne's new projects is a $1.6-billion, multi-year 
contract to develop the electrical power system for a proposed space station 
that might be built by the year 2000. The station likely would be assembled 
with pieces hoisted into space by the shuttles or new "heavy vehicle" unmanned 
rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Rocketdyne, the space station deal is a "cost-plus" contract, 
meaning the government pays for any cost overruns. But Rocketdyne still has 
incentives. The contract includes government "awards," which are paid depending 
on how well Rocketdyne does its job. In a good year, the awards can total in 
the millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
To keep programs as efficient as possible, Rocketdyne and NASA together have 
spent $100 million in recent years to install robots and otherwise modernize 
the company's plants to cut Rocketdyne's production costs. Rocketdyne produces 
a shuttle engine that costs NASA $34 million, down from $45 million originally, 
and Paster wants each engine to sell for $25 million in 1992-93. The robotics, 
reductions in the hundreds of welds needed to assemble the engines and other 
improvements enabled Rocketdyne to cut the engine's cost. 
</P>
<P>
A project Rocketdyne would like to win is to build the engines for a proposed 
"advanced launch system," or ALS. The system would be an unmanned, expendable 
rocket capable of launching up to 200,000 pounds worth of cargo -- compared 
with the 55,000-pound limit of the shuttles, Paster said. 
</P>
<P>
The ALS is meant to be built at much lower cost than the powerful rocket 
engines that sent astronauts to the moon. The government wants the cost for the 
ALS to be between $300 and $500 per pound launched, compared with more than 
$2,000 per pound on current unmanned rockets today. Rocketdyne is competing 
against Pratt &amp; Whitney and a third company, Aerojet-General, a unit of 
GenCorp Inc., for the ALS program. 
</P>
<P>
Rocketdyne has three contracts covering development of an ALS engine, totaling 
$81 million, that were awarded last summer and extend for up to 3 1/2 years. If 
ALS funding continues, the vehicles might be ready in the mid-1990s to help 
build the space station. 
</P>
<P>
Rocketdyne also remains busy making engines for General Dynamics Corp.'s Atlas 
and McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s Delta rockets, which were developed as missiles 
but are now being used to launch commercial and military payloads into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
After the Challenger space shuttle accident on Jan. 28, 1986, the federal 
government opened the way for private, commercial launches of space cargoes. 
Three rocket companies, McDonnell Douglas, General Dynamics and Martin Marietta 
Corp. are expected to dominate the commercial business. That Rocketdyne makes 
engines for two of the big three companies is one reason for its gains in 
backlog and employment. 
</P>
<P>
But Paster also can't sit back and wait for the government to send money if he 
wants to foster Rocketdyne's growth. He's got to keep hustling for contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: Rocketdyne was not originally asked to bid on developing engines for 
the proposed National Aerospace Plane, or NASP, a hypersonic jet that would be 
capable of flying from Washington to Tokyo in two hours. Rocketdyne went ahead 
and spent millions of dollars designing NASP engine concepts that caught the 
attention of federal officials, and it's now vying with Pratt &amp; Whitney to 
build engines for that plane as well. 
</P>
<P>
There's no guarantee that the government will want to build more than the one 
experimental NASP model it has ordered for $3.3 billion. Even if work 
continues, scientists have said a commercial version of the plane could not be 
built until at least the year 2020. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Paster had to act or risk getting left behind. "The task for the guy on 
top is to make sure he sets the company up for the decisions that are going to 
keep it humming five, 10, 15 years from how," said analyst Demisch. 
</P>
<P>
Paster joined Rocketdyne after getting his bachelor's degree in aeronautical 
engineering from the University of Michigan in 1962. He began as a propulsion 
systems engineer for the Gemini, Apollo and other space projects, and 
eventually held management posts in nearly all of Rocketdyne's fields, 
including the Atlas/Delta rocket and Peacekeeper missile programs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, he was named vice president of advanced programs -- in charge of 
Rocketdyne's work on future rockets -- and he became program manager of the 
shuttle's main engine work in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Paster said his background makes him no less a businessman than engineer. "The 
space shuttle main engine division is a $400-million business, with 
manufacturing, quality, engineering, business management, purchasing, 
everything it takes to run a business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It also takes public relations, as Paster is finding out. In recent months, 
neighborhood and environmental groups have pressed Rocketdyne to shut down a 
"hot lab" at its 2,100-acre property in the Santa Susana Mountains, where the 
company used to perform nuclear work such as fabricating nuclear fuel and 
salvaging plutonium from spent nuclear power fuel rods. 
</P>
<P>
Rocketdyne plans to close the lab next year, and Paster said recently that the 
closure would mark the end of Rocketdyne's nuclear work. Most of the Santa 
Susana site is devoted to testing Rocketdyne's engines. 
</P>
<P>
Paster's test as a manager also will go on, as the U.S. government sorts out 
which space programs it can afford and Rocketdyne tries to win a bigger share 
of the space market. "We've been very successful the last several years," he 
said. "I'm not going to come in here and turn Rocketdyne inside out."

VALLEY EARNINGS: NU-MED REPORTS LOSS OF $2.89 MILLION FOR QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nu-Med Inc., an Encino operator of hospitals and other health-care facilities, 
said it lost $2.89 million in its fiscal second quarter, compared with a 
$703,000 profit a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The loss came as Nu-Med's revenue for the quarter that ended Oct. 31 showed 
virtually no change, at $65.5 million, compared with a year ago. Nu-Med blamed 
the loss on several factors, including higher operating costs, lack of revenue 
gains and increased interest expense on its debt. 
</P>
<P>
For the first half of its fiscal year, Nu-Med lost $1.85 million compared with 
a $5.54-million profit a year ago. Its six-month revenue rose to $139.4 million 
from $130.1 million.

News Ratings: Staff members of all-news station KFWB have ranked the Berlin 
Wall/crumbling of Communism the No. 1 news story of 1989. In the station's new 
poll, News 98 staffers ranked the Bay Area earthquake, Chinese democracy 
movement and Exxon Valdez oil spill the second-through-fourth top stories of 
'89. Tied for fifth place was the abortion debate, the Oliver North conviction 
and sentencing and the trial of Zsa Zsa Gabor. KFWB also voted an unofficial 
"Male Newsmaker of the Year" award to Mikhail Gorbachev, with Jim Bakker, 
Oliver North and Richard Ramirez tied for second place. Staffers deemed that 
the hands-down "Female Newsmaker of the Year" was Zsa Zsa Gabor. DANIEL CERONE

East Berlin Encore: East Germans gave Leonard Bernstein a 10-minute standing 
ovation after he conducted Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on Christmas Day to 
celebrate East Germany's peaceful revolution. The concert, which was broadcast 
in the United States and other countries, followed a similar performance that 
Bernstein had given the day before in West Berlin. The flamboyant American 
composer-conductor was awarded a gold "star of friendship between peoples" by 
East German Culture Minister Dietmar Keller, who hailed him as a political and 
musical ambassador. "This is a historic moment for me, unlike any other in my 
long, long life," Bernstein, 71, said with tears in his eyes as he accepted the 
award. In a tribute to the opening of East Germany's borders and the crumbling 
of Communist rule, Bernstein assembled an international orchestra and a choir 
of both East and West German singers. DANIEL CERONE

Sobering Christmas for Press: Covering dramatic world events during the 
Christmas weekend proved to be a tragic assignment for some members of the 
television press. Belgian TV journalist Dany Huwe was killed when supporters of 
deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu ambushed him and opened fire on his car in 
Bucharest early Monday morning. On Friday, French television correspondent 
Jean-Louis Calderon died when he was run over by a tank in Bucharest. Two other 
journalists, both Americans, were wounded in Romania on Sunday. John Tagliabue 
of the New York Times and John Daniszewski of the Associated Press were 
evacuated to Yugoslavia for treatment of bullet wounds. DANIEL CERONE

Nuell Pulled From 'Today': Dave Nuell, who was negotiating with NBC to take 
over the troubled "Today" show Jan. 8, is no longer a candidate for the job, 
the Washington Post reported Monday. NBC News president Michael Gartner 
notified Nuell by overnight letter Friday that negotiations with him were 
terminated and that NBC had decided to withdraw its offer. Nuell, 47, guided 
"Entertainment Tonight" to its current success in TV syndication. He was 
stunned when reached in Santa Barbara. "We had a three-year firm deal that NBC 
reneged on. I intend to take every remedy I have to try to repair the damage," 
the 20-year broadcast news veteran said. "We have tried at NBC News to conclude 
an agreement with Mr. Nuell since the earliest days of September," NBC News 
executive vice president Dick Ebersol said. "Our efforts to do so seem to have 
been continually thwarted. Our needs at the 'Today' show are such that we have 
to move on." NBC sources said that Marty Ryan, executive producer of the 
program, will remain in charge for now. DANIEL CERONE

MIKE DOWNEY: LIKE HIM OR NOT, HE WAS A BASEBALL MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A friend of mine once described Billy Martin as a mouse who wanted to grow up 
to become a rat. 
</P>
<P>
Not a very Christian thing to say about a man, but not too far from the mark, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Martin will best be remembered for punching a pitcher (Jim Brewer) in the 
face, for getting into a fight with another pitcher (Ed Whitson) that left 
Billy with a busted arm, for getting tanked a couple of times too many and for 
getting hired and fired as manager of the New York Yankees like clockwork. 
</P>
<P>
Martin even turned his alcohol habit and nasty temperament into a moneymaker, 
in endorsements for low-calorie beer. He let George Steinbrenner stand right 
next to him, art imitating life, and make a big joke out of: "Billy, you're 
fired." Kind of pathetic, when you think about it. 
</P>
<P>
There used to be a knickknack on Steinbrenner's desk at Yankee Stadium -- a 
large golden numeral, the number "1." Maybe it's still there. This was a 
reference to the boss himself, and not to the jersey number that his spitfire 
of a manager wore on the field of play. This was a reference to the boss from 
the boss. 
</P>
<P>
Right next to this novelty item was a plaque that bore the philosophy: "Lead, 
Follow or Get the Hell Out of the Way." 
</P>
<P>
Their names are to be eternally linked, Martin's and Steinbrenner's, but it was 
Billy who meant so much more to the game of baseball itself. He was a hustling, 
eager-beaver second baseman by trade, born Alfred Manuel Pesano on May 16, 1928 
in Berkeley, who batted .257 over an 11-year major-league career, playing for 
the Yankees, Detroit, Cleveland and Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
He was a star, but never a Star. That much he knew. When the Hall of Fame 
archives-keepers found out that Martin happened to have in his possession the 
last bat that Joe DiMaggio ever used in the big leagues, they asked him to 
donate it to Cooperstown. Martin agreed, with one proviso: "I want you to put a 
tag on the bat that says I donated it." 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" he was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Because that's the only way I'll ever get in there," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
He punched out only 877 hits, and never hit even as high as .270 over the 
course of a full season. But he punched out just about everything else -- time 
clocks, teammates, opponents, fellow stool occupants in saloons, even a 
marshmallow salesman from Minnesota once. He mixed it up with Brewer on a 
pitching mound and with Whitson in the hallways of a hotel. He'd fight anybody, 
anywhere, anytime. 
</P>
<P>
This should hardly be his epitaph, but it's not too far off the mark, either. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Martin was the butt of jokes, though rarely to his face. Some of them he 
enjoyed when he heard them. Like the one about him going hunting for the first 
time with Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford. The way the story went, Mantle and 
Ford pulled a practical joke on Martin, telling him that a stubborn farmer had 
refused them permission to hunt on his land. The punchline was Mantle's: "By 
the time we stopped him, Billy had shot two cows and a pig." 
</P>
<P>
To this day, not everybody is convinced that this story is apocryphal. 
</P>
<P>
Martin could certainly be a pleasant presence in person. We spent some time 
together in his office once or twice, quiet times during his stormy reigns in 
New York, and more than once he asked me to double-check to see if we might 
possibly be related, since his mother's surname was the same as mine. I assured 
him we were not. I never checked. I just assured him that we were not. 
</P>
<P>
Around two weeks ago, I read that Martin's mother had died. It was the first 
thought I had given him in some time, in fact the first public mention of his 
name in some time. 
</P>
<P>
The way Lou Piniella, Dallas Green and so many others have stepped before the 
pin-striped executioner with the "NY" on his hood, I suppose we've all been 
waiting for Billy Martin to turn up again as Yankee manager. One day, when 
Steinbrenner invited a few people over to witness the "resignation" of Dick 
Howser as manager, a clearly uncomfortable Howser was asked what advice he 
would give his successor, Gene Michael. 
</P>
<P>
"To have a strong stomach and a nice contract," Howser replied. 
</P>
<P>
To his credit, I guess, Billy Martin always did have these necessities. He knew 
baseball, and he demanded much of his players. The knocks against him as a 
strategist tended to be that he overworked his starting pitchers and played 
favorites, but more often than not, wherever he was managing, Martin got the 
most from what he had. He won division titles in Minnesota, Detroit and Oakland 
as well as New York, don't forget. 
</P>
<P>
I found a quote from him Christmas night, upon learning of his death. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of 25 guys, there should be 15 who would run through a wall for you, two 
or three who don't like you at all, five who are indifferent and maybe three 
undecided," Martin said during his managing days. "My job is to keep the last 
two groups from going the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
Billy Martin made some enemies, made some friends, made some contact, made some 
errors, made people evaluate and re-evaluate him before he was done. He led. He 
followed. And he never got out of anybody's way, including his own. Some go 
quietly. Billy Martin did not.

MISSISSIPPI STATE'S ANDERSON HAS SURPRISE DAY

Jesse Anderson didn't expect to play such a big role in the Blue-Gray All-Star 
football game. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I would maybe catch two of three passes," said Anderson, a tight end 
at Mississippi State who caught nine passes for 93 yards and a touchdown Monday 
and was named the Gray's most valuable player in a 28-10 victory over the Blue. 
</P>
<P>
"It means a whole lot to me," he said of the award. "I thought we would run a 
lot, but we mixed it up and it helped me out." 
</P>
<P>
The Gray did have a balanced attack -- throwing 39 times and running 36 -- but 
did most of its damage through the air behind Neil O'Donnell of Maryland and 
John Gromos of Vanderbilt. They combined to complete 24 of 39 passes for 330 
yards, while the Gray rushed for only 99 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Ricky Proehl of Wake Forest caught a 48-yard touchdown pass and set up another 
score with a 65-yard reception as the Gray rallied from a 10-0 deficit with two 
touchdowns in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson ran the lead to 21-10 on a 12-yard touchdown reception with 6:20 to go 
in the third quarter. O'Donnell, who threw for 167 yards in an 11-for-20 
performance, set up Anderson's touchdown with the 65-yard pass to Proehl, who 
got loose down the right sideline and sprinted to the Blue 15. 
</P>
<P>
Proehl sealed the victory with a juggling reception as he fell into the end 
zone with 2:51 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of had to wait for the ball to come down because the quarterback had 
some pressure," Proehl said. "It hit me in the shoulder pads and bounced a few 
times before I finally was able to bring it down." 
</P>
<P>
The most valuable player from the Blue team was Oregon's Latin Berry, who led 
all rushers with 35 yards on seven carries. He also caught three passes for 14 
yards.

Michigan State is a tough enough opponent for a team playing its best football. 
In Monday's Aloha Bowl, Hawaii learned the hard way it's impossible to stay 
with the Spartans when you make mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
The 25th-ranked Rainbows (9-3-1) committed eight turnovers and were outmuscled 
by No. 22 Michigan State (8-4), 33-13. 
</P>
<P>
"If you turn the ball over as many times as we did, it's difficult to win," 
said Hawaii Coach Bob Wagner, who called the Rainbows' first bowl appearance 
"very frustrating and very disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
"They took better care of the ball than we did," Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
Blake Ezor rushed for an Aloha Bowl record 179 yards and scored three 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Ezor's three touchdowns gave him 19 for the season, breaking the school's 
season record of 18 set by Eric Allen in 1971. He was named the bowl's most 
valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
"Pound for pound he's the toughest kid I ever met," said Michigan State Coach 
George Perles.

"The game was a real high, but I'm sorry it's over," said Ezor, a senior who 
played his last game for the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
The Rainbows fumbled seven times, losing four, breaking the Aloha Bowl fumble 
record of five set by North Carolina in 1986. Hawaii committed turnovers on its 
first six drives of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm real upset with myself. I did what I didn't want to do," said Hawaii 
quarterback Garrett Gabriel, who was in on two muffed option pitches in the 
first quarter. "The first two were my fault -- they were just bad pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end Mark Vanderbeek recovered three fumbles for Michigan State. 
Linebacker Carlos Jenkins recovered a fumble, intercepted a pass and blocked an 
extra-point kick for the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel completed 19 of 31 passes for 197 yards and two touchdowns. But he also 
threw three interceptions, and backup quarterback Ken Niumatalolo had one. 
Michigan State's Dan Enos was intercepted twice. The total of six interceptions 
broke the bowl record of three set in 1988 by Washington State and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive year, the Christmas Day game was marred by a 
bench-clearing brawl. It came with 8:06 left in the game when Hawaii attempted 
an on-side kick which failed. Coaches and officials struggled for more than a 
minute to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel completed four passes to Chris Roscoe as the Rainbows drove for a 
touchdown on their first possession of the third quarter. Gabriel hit Roscoe 
from 11 yards out on a touchdown pass with 9:45 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
All-American linebacker Percy Snow intercepted Gabriel on Hawaii's final drive 
of game. He had nine tackles and blocked a pass.

RATS HAVEN'T ABANDONED CELTICS' SHIP, BUT SOME OF THEM ARE TALKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The surprise-o-meter went tilt last week. Even the rats, among Boston Garden's 
most durable tenants, couldn't have been ready for this one. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bird a cancer to the Celtics? Selfish? Boston barely made the playoffs 
when he was out most of 1988-89. With Bird this season, the team is back to 
respectability -- 14-11 heading into tonight's game against the Clippers at the 
Sports Arena -- but he is taking too many shots? 
</P>
<P>
So says one unidentified teammate, who took his complaint to the limit last 
week and told the New York Post: "He used to hold us together. Now, he's 
tearing us apart." A similar story a day later in the Boston Herald aired 
nearly identical viewpoints, again from unidentified players. 
</P>
<P>
The day the Herald story ran, the Celtics played the Utah Jazz at Boston 
Garden. Bird had 40 points, eight rebounds and five assists -- and a jumper in 
the closing seconds that sealed a 113-109 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Bird is averaging 23.4 points, making 46.1% from the field and shooting 19.96 
times a game; he averaged 19.58 attempts the first 10 years of his career. In 
the midst of a comeback from heel and ankle problems that limited him to six 
games last season, he is the first to say the touch has not returned. But has 
he become a gunner? 
</P>
<P>
"At some point, you've got to look at yourself in the mirror and ask, 'Am I 
producing the way I should be on the basketball court?' " said Bird, who claims 
there is no pain associated with his recent medical history. "I'm playing very 
hard. My shots aren't falling, but I'm doing my very best. 
</P>
<P>
"The only time I'm not going to shoot is if the coaches tell me, or DJ (Dennis 
Johnson) or Robert (Parish) tell me. Then I might think about slowing down." 
</P>
<P>
"I know who was talking in the article and it's funny to me somebody says 
something to somebody else when he's not even doing his job." 
</P>
<P>
Bird would not elaborate on the source. When teammates did talk on the record, 
it was full support ahead for one of the greatest players ever, or at least 
blame was passed around. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't put much credence in stories like that," Kevin McHale said. "I think 
our team chemistry is fine. The only times we have trouble are when we try to 
do too much ourselves. We are all guilty of that." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things. 
</P>
<P>
If the league, represented by Commissioner David Stern, and the union, the 
National Basketball Players Assn., have both come out so strongly against 
betting on NBA games as part of lotteries, why do teams accept money from the 
organizations? 
</P>
<P>
In Oregon, the center of the debate, you need go only as far as page 2 of 
Portland's media guide before finding a full-page advertisement supporting the 
state lottery. The enterprise also sponsors Trail Blazer radio and TV 
broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a contradiction somewhere? 
</P>
<P>
Motivation comes in different forms. For Indiana's Reggie Miller, it was about 
putting Mike Tyson in his place without having to worry if the medical 
insurance was paid up. 
</P>
<P>
It started at the benefit dinner that preceded Magic Johnson's charity all-star 
game last summer. Miller was there, chatting with Johnson, Ron Harper, Mark 
Aguirre and Dominique Wilkins. Tyson joined the group. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all talking about who we thought was going to be good this season," 
Miller said last week. "I started talking about the Pacers. Mike gets into this 
thing about, 'Who's Indiana? What's Indiana?' It was all good-natured ribbing, 
but I told him, 'OK, you just look at the box scores. You just look at the 
standings. You'll see the new-look Pacers.' " 
</P>
<P>
If Tyson has been paying attention to basketball while concentrating on boxing, 
he will have noticed the revamped Pacers, with eight new players and a new 
coach from this time a year ago, are one of the NBA's surprise teams. Led by 
Miller, an early all-star candidate, Indiana is 15-9 and only a half-game 
behind first-place Chicago in the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
Former UCLA standout Miller figures he will wait until the end of the season 
before boasting to Tyson, however. Even then, he's not sure it's such a good 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be victim No. 38," he said. 
</P>
<P>
All the Kings' men: When the Sacramento Kings shook up the front office last 
week, it meant a couple things: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The new president, 33-year-old Rick Benner, becomes the youngest chief 
executive of a professional sports team in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Landmark events happen to Bill Russell on Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three years to the day he signed his first contract with the Boston 
Celtics, after helping the United States win the gold medal at the Melbourne 
Olympics, he was fired as vice president of basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Russell's tenure at Sacramento was a major disappointment. It didn't 
help that one of the game's all-time greats went to a city loving most every 
minute of its young basketball life and alienated himself from the fans. 
Although he had a good rapport with players, his reputation among the people 
who paid to fill Arco Arena every night -- literally -- was that of an aloof 
celebrity who refused to sign autographs. 
</P>
<P>
Benner put it most tactfully upon taking over. "I don't want to say anything 
about what happened. I just want to say there is room for improvement, for 
better communication." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the blame for the Kings' dismal record fell not on Coach Jerry 
Reynolds, but on Russell, because this was a team he put together. Trading for 
Ralph Sampson, complete with bad knees and a $1.9-million contract, and then 
not being able to maneuver much around the salary cap for replacements when 
injuries set in will be one lasting memory. 
</P>
<P>
So, when Sacramento Bee columnist Joe Hamelin asked Gregg Lukenbill how hard 
was it to fire a legend who had the players' respect, the team's managing 
general partner paused and said: "Not as hard as watching the team lose night 
after night." 
</P>
<P>
NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics, who insisted they would make a decision this season on whether 
to stay in Seattle, now say they will wait until the summer before deciding. 
That means they'll be back in an arena they hate for 1990-91. Or longer. . . . 
Glen Rice continues to wage a food fight with himself, first reporting to camp 
at 231 pounds and then, after losing too much, having to be encouraged to order 
double entrees to bulk up to 216. "I just did not have discipline," the Miami 
Heat rookie said of his off-season regimen. "My kitchen became my weightlifting 
room, lifting pots and pans to cook and lifting food to put into my mouth." The 
No. 4 pick overall, he went into the weekend shooting 40.4%, and Coach Ron 
Rothstein told him to lay off the three-point shots a while to regain some 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
When the Utah Jazz's John Stockton had 27 assists last Tuesday at New York, it 
set a quasi-record: Most assists in a road game. The three who have done 
better, topped by Kevin Porter with 29 for New Jersey in 1978, all accomplished 
the feat at home. Twenty games into the season, Stockton was averaging 14.3 
assists -- compared to 16.1 for the entire New Jersey Net team. . . . By 
beating the Chicago Bulls last Wednesday, the expansion Orlando Magic had 
defeated six of 1988-89's playoff teams.

RAM-PATRIOT GAME BROUGHT OUT THE BEST IN SLATER AND GROGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a wonder Jackie Slater and Steve Grogan, two 35-year-olds who entered the 
NFL before the disco movement, made it through Sunday's sub-zero game without 
needing antifreeze. 
</P>
<P>
They're not getting colder, they're getting better. 
</P>
<P>
New England's Grogan, suffering from the flu, replaced starting quarterback 
Marc Wilson in the second quarter and finished with 313 passing yards, falling 
four yards short of the end zone in a 24-20 loss to the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"The old man was really throwing the ball well," Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
Slater, the Rams' right tackle, throws blocks, and he didn't have a bad game 
either, helping to raise the offensive line from its slumber. Slater also 
cleared a path that sprung Greg Bell loose for his game-winning, three-yard 
scoring run with 1:55 remaining at Sullivan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
No surprise there. Rams have been running Slater's way for 14 seasons. On 
Bell's touchdown run, Slater pinched Patriot defensive end Milford Hodge inside 
to make room for Bell. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason, he (Hodge) raised his head up, and I was able to get under 
him," Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't been the best of seasons for the Rams' offensive line, which has 
struggled at times to keep running lanes open for Bell and others. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a great Sunday, and just in time for the playoffs. Slater said line 
coach Hudson Houck worked overtime last week dissecting New England's defensive 
schemes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think our concentration level on the line was as high as it's been in a long 
time," Slater said. "We were just able to flat-out get it done. I doubt that we 
had any assignment errors at all. Maybe one or two." 
</P>
<P>
Slater won't be around when young Rams grow up. He figures he has one more shot 
at the Super Bowl, maybe two. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been the most fun year I've had in a long time," Slater said. "As you 
look at this football team in the '90s, I think this team will bring a 
championship to Los Angeles. I just have a feeling about this team. With the 
young talent, it can't help get better and better." 
</P>
<P>
The two faces of Bell: He gained nearly half (559) of his 1,137 rushing yards 
in three games this season. In those games, he averaged 6.9 yards per carry. 
Bell averaged three yards per rush in 13 others. And when was the last time a 
tailback had more 200-yard rushing games than 100-yard games in one season? 
Bell gained 221 yards against Green Bay on Sept. 24 and 210 against New 
England. His only 100-yard game came on opening day in Atlanta, when he rushed 
for 128 against the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who seems to disappear for weeks at a time when nicked with injuries, 
saved his best stuff for the Patriots. He proved to be quick, strong, and 
elusive. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Coach John Robinson said Bell's hot-and-cold season shouldn't come as a 
shock. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that the way it goes in this league?" Robinson asked. "You don't succeed 
that well, that easily, all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams should get a couple more bodies back on defense this week. Defensive 
end Mike Piel is expected to return from a dislocated elbow. In addition, the 
team can use its free roster move this week to activate safety James 
Washington, who would step in for injured safety Anthony Newman (fractured 
elbow). 
</P>
<P>
Also out of the New England game with injuries were defensive ends Doug Reed 
and Bill Hawkins. Two more Rams, starting left end Shawn Miller (groin) and 
cornerback Cliff Hicks (right knee bruise), were forced from the game with 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate playoff forecast for the Rams remains distant and cold, but if 
they beat Philadelphia in Sunday's wild-card game at Veterans Stadium, they'll 
pack their bags again a week later and meet the New York Giants at the 
Meadowlands in a first-round divisional game. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, Sunday's game against New England provided the Rams with some 
cold-weather training. 
</P>
<P>
"At least you know now where you get the clothes," Robinson said. "It isn't so 
much the weather, but you have to put on all these different clothes, and you 
have to drive the rental car differently. All those things are different." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
With 232 passing yards Sunday, Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski finished the 
season with an NFL-leading 4,318 yards, eight more than Jim Everett. But for 
the second consecutive season, Everett led the league in touchdown passes. He 
finished with 29, two more than Majkowski. Cincinnati's Boomer Esiason moved 
into second with three touchdown passes Monday night, giving him 28. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson claims Sunday's sub-freezing temperatures posed no problems 
for either team. "I never saw a dropped pass," he said. Robinson must have been 
looking elsewhere when his tight end, Damone Johnson, wide open in the end 
zone, dropped a sure touchdown pass in the first quarter. . . The Rams averaged 
6.8 yards per offensive play against the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Kevin Greene said his team's crazy finishes must mean there is 
something in the stars for the Rams this season. "It's happening, that 
feeling," he said. "And I'm leading the way.". . . A public service 
announcement from safety Vince Newsome: "We're never just going to get a 
comfortable lead in a game and ride it out. I don't think it's in the best 
interest for us or our fans, but that's what we just seem to do."

U.S. TIGHTENS GUARD AROUND NORIEGA REFUGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A hardening determination by the Bush Administration to apprehend Manuel A. 
Noriega left the self-proclaimed "maximum leader" of Panama isolated inside the 
Vatican embassy on Monday, even as American troops used stringent measures to 
underline the tough U.S. stance. 
</P>
<P>
While delicate diplomatic negotiations were taking place on Noriega's fate, 
heavily armed American troops in effect created a one-man prison for the 
54-year-old former strongman, who sought sanctuary Sunday and has indicated he 
seeks long-term political asylum in Spain or Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Tanks, armored personnel carriers and U.S. soldiers, their faces camouflaged 
with lime-green paint, blocked off one of the city's major roads near the 
ornate Vatican outpost. The French ambassador, the Spanish envoy and the German 
charge d'affaires all had their cars stopped and searched from engine to trunk 
-- and even beneath the carriage. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Spanish ambassador goes out of the Vatican embassy with Noriega bundled 
in the trunk of his car, we're going to stop them and take him out," one 
American official declared. 
</P>
<P>
Overhead, a specially equipped, four-engine AC-130 gunship circled slowly and 
endlessly, ready to open fire with an array of weapons "that could level this 
whole damn city," in the words of one U.S. source. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, American troops surrounded the Cuban ambassador's residence 
and bunkers bristling with assault rifles, rocket launchers and cannon were 
outside the closed Cuban Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Cuban political counselor Luis Delfin Perez, who said he was quoting a U.S. 
military official, charged in a telephone interview that "the American troops 
say they have orders to arrest all who come in here or leave here, including 
the ambassador and me." 
</P>
<P>
He said the heavily armed troops are "showing a very aggressive attitude in 
pointing their arms in here." 
</P>
<P>
Spanish diplomats reported that American troops Sunday night strung razor wire 
across their embassy's front door, aimed weapons at the building and for a time 
prevented anyone, including the ambassador, from entering or leaving. Although 
access finally was allowed, anyone trying to enter the building Monday, 
including Panamanian citizens, could approach the embassy only with an armed 
American escort. 
</P>
<P>
The large number of soldiers stationed around the diplomatic facilities are 
explained by American officials as necessary to prevent Noriega's escape. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Noriega is being restricted to small, sparse quarters inside the 
Vatican embassy. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no dirty pictures, drugs or women," said one source, referring to 
the pornographic photos and large quantities of cocaine that the Americans said 
they found in raids last week on Noriega's homes and offices. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, his less-than-gilded existence could go on for some time, according 
to American and other diplomatic officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see him out in a day, a week or even years," Javier Herrera, first 
secretary at the Spanish Embassy here, declared. "It could be like the 
Mindszenty case," he said, referring to the circumstances of Cardinal Josef 
Mindszenty, the anti-Communist Roman Catholic Church leader from Hungary who 
spent nearly 15 years in the U.S. Embassy in Budapest after seeking political 
asylum in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, a similar fate faces 30 other Panamanian supporters and allies 
of Noriega, including his one-time puppet president, Manuel Solis Palma, who 
also are in the Vatican embassy under papal protection. About 10 to 20 
Panamanians also are inside the Cuban ambassador's residence. 
</P>
<P>
Military roadblocks are everywhere. Panamanians walking along the streets are 
frequently startled by loud commands from hidden bullhorns ordering them to 
stop and retrace their steps. 
</P>
<P>
As the Americans took near-total control of Panama City's streets, U.S. forces 
also steadily moved into the Panamanian countryside and occupied areas where 
there have been no riots, no resistance and no loss of public order. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Jerry Murguia, chief of current operations at the U.S. Southern 
Command, cited the "touchy situation" concerning Noriega and the Vatican as a 
primary reason for the moves and noted that "there is still a lot of military 
work to do." He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
No incidents of combat have occurred for about a day and a half, and all 
significant resistance from pro-Noriega forces seems to have dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
But if U.S. soldiers are not actually engaged in combat any more, American 
officials acknowledged, they are still carrying out tasks usually not assigned 
to foreign troops in a so-called friendly country. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the security for a news conference held this week by President 
Guillermo Endara was provided by Defense Department agents in civilian clothing 
as well as uniformed American soldiers, although members of Panama's new police 
force were available. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the U.S. military is searching for and arresting civilian 
political supporters of Noriega even though they do not face American or 
Panamanian criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Runione, a one-time minister of industry and a leader of Noriega's 
political party, was taken into custody Monday by American soldiers at the 
request of the Endara government. No charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
This followed the forceable break-in by U.S. troops Sunday at the house of 
Orville Goodin, a radical leftist backer of Noriega. He too was arrested by 
American units, although he faces no criminal charges in Panama or the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
One U.S. official acknowledged that the American military's apparent 
willingness to pursue what may be only political vengeance on behalf of the new 
Panamanian government is "a serious problem." It is difficult to sort out 
legitimate requests to apprehend real criminals from those seeking to punish 
old political foes, this source said.

CLEAN AIR QUEST -- AN INSIDE JOB; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN IT COMES TO HUMAN HEALTH, POLLUTION IN HOMES AND OFFICES MAY BE THE 
GREATEST THREAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since Congress passed the Clean Air Act in 1970, the nation has marshaled 
its political, economic and technological forces to rid the skies of 
health-threatening air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Billions of dollars have been spent to control emissions from motor vehicles, 
factories, refineries and power plants. Still stricter standards are planned. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, for all the efforts to restore blue skies to the nation's smoggiest 
cities, a growing body of scientific evidence suggests that when it comes to 
human health, indoor contaminants may pose the most pervasive air pollution 
threat of all. 
</P>
<P>
Concentrations of some toxic, cancer-causing and mutagenic pollutants found 
indoors are up to 100 times greater indoors than they are outdoors. They far 
exceed limits placed on the same pollutants in outdoor air by the federal Clean 
Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
From tobacco smoke and radioactive radon gas to molds, fungi, combustion 
products and everyday household products like air fresheners and pesticides, 
humans are being exposed in their homes, offices and vehicles to thousands of 
chemical and biological agents. 
</P>
<P>
Couple these concentrations with the fact that most people spend between 80% to 
90% of their time in increasingly tight energy-efficient buildings, and indoor 
pollution becomes especially worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
How worrisome remains an open question. Aside from the severe effects of indoor 
pollutants like asbestos, lead and carbon monoxide, little is known about the 
health threat posed by other pollutants commonly found in homes and offices. 
</P>
<P>
Still, scientists say that it is reasonable to conclude that as exposures 
increase indoors, so do the risks. 
</P>

"Sufficient evidence exists to conclude that indoor air pollution represents a 
major portion of the public's exposure to air pollution and may pose serious 
acute and chronic health risks," the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said 
in a report to Congress earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates by some individual researchers indicate that indoor pollution could 
rank among the top 10 causes of death in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists for years have appealed to the EPA for greater attention to indoor 
pollution issues. Their pleas have met with little success. During the Reagan 
Administration, EPA requests for research funds were repeatedly reduced, and 
the Bush Administration has allowed only modest increases. 
</P>
<P>
While the EPA staff has estimated that $20 million a year would be needed for 
indoor air pollution research -- the figure now proposed in legislation by 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and Rep. Joseph Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) -- the Bush Administration this year is spending only $2.68 million. 
The Bush Administration opposes the Mitchell and Kennedy bills, which are 
scheduled for votes next year. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even with limited funds, the EPA is calling for studies to pin down the 
health effects of indoor pollution. It is also seeking ways to reduce indoor 
contaminants as well as a joint effort by government and industry to develop a 
voluntary program to upgrade building ventilation standards as well as building 
design, and improved operation and maintenance of heating, air conditioning and 
ventilation systems. 
</P>
<P>
In a report made public earlier this month, the EPA compared risks of 20 
different environmental problems. Radon, indoor air pollution and pesticide 
residues on foods pose the greatest health risk but received the least amount 
of federal spending on those problems, the report said. Toxic dumps and leaking 
underground gasoline storage tanks pose far less risk but receive the lion's 
share of money and attention from the EPA, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
"We concentrate on the big visible sources, chemical plants and oil refineries 
and outdoor air but the true exposures are the little things under your nose," 
said Lance Wallace, a leading authority on indoor pollution. Wallace, an EPA 
scientist, has pioneered studies aimed at determining the "total exposure" to 
pollutants from all sources, both outdoor and indoor. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA has estimated that indoor pollution may cost "tens of billions" of 
dollars annually when medical spending and lost productivity are added up. The 
Consumer Federation of America has placed the costs as high as $100 billion a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
List of Dangers 
</P>
<P>
A bewildering array of organic compounds from household products form the 
catalogue of indoor pollution threats: 
</P>
<P>
* Asbestos, found in cement and insulation, can lead to lung cancer or 
asbestosis, a chronic lung ailment. Numerous asbestos-abatement programs are 
under way in schools and public buildings. In July, the EPA banned most 
remaining uses of asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
* Lead, which retards intellectual and emotional development in children, can 
be found in older plumbing and in household dust as old paint deteriorates or 
is chipped away during remodeling. 
</P>
<P>
* Radon, a radioactive gas, invades homes through cracks in the foundation and 
is the nation's second leading cause of lung cancer. It may be present at 
levels the EPA considers unsafe in as many as 12 million U.S. homes; levels 
have been found to be generally below EPA guidelines in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
* Formaldehyde, a probable human cancer-causing agent, wafts from foam 
insulation, plywood and particle board. 
</P>
<P>
* Benzene, a known human carcinogen, is found in cigarette smoke and gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
* Nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and fine particulates that can cause 
respiratory illnesses spew from kerosene heaters and unvented or poorly 
maintained gas appliances. 
</P>
<P>
* Chemicals that are known animal carcinogens or toxics are frequently found at 
very low levels in air fresheners, shoe polish, paints, printed materials, 
household cleaners, solvents, moth balls and dry-cleaned clothes. 
</P>
<P>
* An estimated 84% of U.S. households use home pesticides, many of which have 
never been tested to determine their health effects. 
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization has estimated that up to 30% of new and remodeled 
buildings may be plagued by indoor air quality problems -- an estimate borne 
out by widespread reports of "sick building" illnesses, including government 
workers at the EPA's own headquarters in Washington. In California alone, there 
are 700 sick building reports a year. 
</P>
<P>
EPA researchers have theorized that -- based on available data -- indoor 
pollution, including second-hand tobacco smoke, may account for up to 11,400 
deaths each year. Radon exposures may result in anywhere from 3,000 to 20,000 
additional deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Up to an estimated 30,000 additional deaths annually have been attributed by 
one scientist, Harriet Burge of the University of Michigan, to legionella 
bacteria that thrive in poorly maintained hospital systems for hot water, 
heating, air conditioning and ventilation. 
</P>
<P>
But even if far fewer cancers are caused by indoor pollutants than EPA 
estimates suggest, there remains cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
Many researchers believe that the greatest and most costly problem posed by 
indoor pollution may well be the chronic, non-cancerous but debilitating health 
effects that result in higher medical costs, absenteeism and reduced 
productivity in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
Few today say that efforts to control outdoor air pollution are unimportant or 
that they must stop. But a growing number of scientists say the threat to human 
health from indoor pollution can no longer be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
"If we measured outdoors what we are measuring indoors, there would be a 
tremendous hue and cry to clean up outdoor air," Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
The embryonic indoor air pollution programs of both the state and federal 
governments pale in significance when compared to spending on other 
environmental health problems. In California, while radon tied with worker 
exposure to hazardous chemicals as the No. 1 cancer risk, it ranked last in 
state spending on 25 environmental problems as recently as two years ago. 
Likewise, all other indoor air pollution ranked fourth on the list of cancer 
risks, but 11th in spending among the 25 environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 1981, the National Academy of Sciences described indoor air 
pollution as a potentially significant human health problem. It called for a 
wide-ranging research effort. But it wasn't until 1985 that the magnitude of 
the indoor pollution threat became readily apparent. A five-year EPA study 
surveyed 600 individuals in six cities to find out what their exposure was to 
20 different chemicals, some of which have been linked with cancer and birth 
defects. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers were startled by the findings. It did not matter whether the study 
participants lived in the Los Angeles area next to an oil refinery or in a 
pristine rural setting. Indoor concentrations of the 20 chemical compounds 
studied were almost always higher, often by as much as 10 times or more, than 
they were outdoors. Peak concentrations in some homes were 200 to 500 times 
higher than outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
Indoor Sources 
</P>
<P>
Blood samples and breath tests revealed that participants from rural areas were 
burdened with as much chemical contaminants in their systems as urban dwellers 
-- a fact that researchers said could only point to indoor sources of pollution 
common in every household. 
</P>
<P>
The study's findings left questions that must still be resolved: 
</P>
<P>
Are higher exposures indoors necessarily dangerous? What are the cumulative and 
synergistic effects, if any, of simultaneous exposures to more than 600 
compounds from building materials and household products found in homes? 
</P>
<P>
Are health risks too high or are they comparable to everyday risks that most 
people take for granted, like driving on a freeway? Will serious health effects 
take years to show up, as proved to be the case with asbestos? Can it be 
reasonably assumed that because high doses of some pollutants produce 
unquestionable adverse health effects in animals that the low-level exposures 
that most humans experience indoors are also harmful? 
</P>
<P>
What is clear is that the elderly, young children and those who suffer from 
respiratory problems or are chemically sensitive are particularly vulnerable to 
indoor contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
Studies in the United States and Britain have found, for example, that children 
who are exposed to elevated levels of nitrogen dioxide, a combustion product 
emitted by kerosene heaters and gas appliances, had more than twice the 
incidence of respiratory illness as children who were not exposed. Their 
symptoms included fever, chest pain, productive cough, wheeze, chest cold, 
physician-diagnosed bronchitis, physician-diagnosed pneumonia and asthma. 
</P>
<P>
Benzene, a known human carcinogen, has been found in far higher concentrations 
indoors than outdoors. In Los Angeles, the EPA found that 71.2% of exposure to 
benzene occurred indoors. Benzene is emitted by synthetic fibers, plastics and 
some cleaning solutions. It is also present in gasoline fumes and cigarette 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace said that 37 participants in the air pollution exposure studies who 
filled their own gasoline tanks at self-service pumps had twice as much benzene 
in their breath two to five hours after filling up the gas tank as 300 other 
participants who did not fill their own tanks. But Wallace added that "the most 
important exposure to benzene is cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
Cigarette Smoke 
</P>
<P>
Benzene levels in homes with smokers were 30% to 50% higher than in nonsmoking 
households. Smokers and those around them are exposed to an estimated 4,600 
chemical constituents in cigarette smoke, a number of them cancer-causing. 
Various studies have estimated that environmental tobacco smoke may account for 
upwards of 5,000 deaths a year among nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, EPA scientist James L. Repace has said that the risks of indoor air 
pollution from tobacco smoke to nonsmokers are almost twice as great as from 
radon gas, and more than a hundred times as great as the total death rate from 
all cancer-causing hazardous outdoor air pollutants regulated by the EPA under 
the Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have noted that a 1985 study published by the American Journal of 
Public Health showed "significant increases" in deaths due to leukemia and 
lymphomas among people who were exposed as children to parental smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, there are 200,000 emergency room admissions due to allergies and a 
third of them are believed to be caused by microbiologicals contaminants found 
indoors, according to Burge, the director of the University of Michigan's 
allergy research laboratories at Ann Arbor. "We know that microbial 
contamination exists. We know that it causes disease and without a doubt it 
causes a significant number of lost work days at a cost to society," said 
Burge. 
</P>
<P>
Sources of Peril 
</P>
<P>
Biological contaminants can thrive in building ventilation systems that are 
poorly maintained or designed. They can also proliferate in hot water systems 
if the water is not kept at temperatures of at least 113 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Porous insulation and filters combined with excessive humidity make for an 
ideal growing medium for microbiologicals. 
</P>
<P>
Formaldehyde, which is widely used in building materials and furnishings, can 
cause eye, nose and throat irritation, coughing, skin rashes, headaches, 
dizziness, nausea, vomiting and nosebleeds. It also causes nasal cancer in rats 
and is thus a suspected human carcinogen. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the newer the building material or furnishings, the higher the 
formaldehyde gas emissions. High temperatures and humidity can compound the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Today, most pressed-wood product manufacturers have taken steps to lower 
concentrations of formaldehyde to acceptable levels, even in mobile homes where 
the problem was once greatest. But researchers continue to find a 10-fold 
difference in emission from identical products produced by different 
manufacturers. Carpet makers stopped using formaldehyde in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Also of special concern is methylene chloride, which can produce cancer in 
animals and is widely used in paint removers and as a propellant in aerosol 
spray paint and can affect oxygen uptake in the blood like carbon monoxide. 
Some half billion pounds are produced annually, and half of that goes into 
consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have every right to be concerned about some of the consumer 
products that are used," said John Girman of the California Department of 
Health Services, referring to methylene chloride. 
</P>
<P>
Air refresheners used in rooms, cars, diaper pails and toilets are also of 
concern. Many of these products use p-Dichlorobenzene or limonene, both of 
which have been found to cause cancer in animals. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA's Wallace said his studies found that these two chemicals accounted for 
the greatest risk of cancer among 45 indoor air organic chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
A good deal of scientific uncertainity exists over what, if any, the effects of 
long-term exposure to p-Dichlorobenzene may be, but the EPA said it would be 
"prudent" to avoid non-essential consumer products containing the chemical. 
</P>
<P>
Behavior Changes 
</P>
<P>
While the actual health threats of many indoor contaminants are not known, 
reducing or eliminating exposure to them in many cases is fairly 
straightforward. It could involve changes in behavior as obvious as stopping 
smoking (or only smoking outdoors) or making certain that ventilation systems 
are properly maintained and operated. 
</P>
<P>
"To get substantial reductions, you don't have to go off in the woods and eat 
nuts and berries," said John Holmes, chief of the California Air Resource 
Board's research division. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinary house plants can help, a study by the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration found. The study said that philodendrons, spider plants and the 
golden pothos were most effective at absorbing formaldehyde, while flowers like 
the gerbera daisy and chrysanthemums were best at reducing levels of benzene. 
Bamboo palm, English ivy, peace lily, mother-in-law's tongue and Chinese 
evergreen also proved to be effective air purifiers, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers can substitute safer products for those that give off toxic 
chemicals, and carefully follow directions on the use and storage of 
pesticides, paints and solvents. 
</P>
<P>
"In a large number of cases we see it's going to be pretty much up to 
individuals to make their own choices as to what steps they should or shouldn't 
take to reduce their exposure to indoor air pollution," said Robert Axelrad, 
director of the EPA's indoor air division. 
</P>
<P>
"These kinds of health risks have been there all along. We just haven't 
realized it," said Holmes. "But slowly we're getting the results from what is a 
gigantic experiment. As it becomes clear what the risks are, at least on a 
selective basis, society will move to reduce or severely limit those risks." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AIR POLLUTION SOURCES IN THE HOME 
</P>
<P>
Concentrations of some airborne pollutants have been found to be up to 100 
times greater indoors than outdoors. Scientists say much remains to be learned 
about the health effects of indoor air pollution. But they agree that higher 
pollution levels indoors mean higher health risks. Following is a list of air 
pollutants commonly found in homes and offices and what can be done to reduce 
exposures.

A small tree stood at one end of the neat, sparsely furnished room, and a 
candleholder with three white tapers sat on a little folding table. It was 
Christmas dinner in Bucharest, the first free Christmas in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Two American reporters had been invited to eat at the home of a Romanian 
couple, an event that only a few days ago would have brought swift retaliation 
against the Romanians and a lengthy jail term. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, the fear that has so long enveloped this land prevents publication of 
their names or the name of their English-speaking Romanian friend who shared in 
the meal. 
</P>
<P>
But with the sudden, bloody downfall of Nicolae Ceausescu's leadership, that 
fear has begun to crumble. Romanians for the first time in decades are 
beginning to speak openly again. Western correspondents are hearing firsthand 
the full dimensions of the horror and pettiness of totalitarian rule here. 
</P>
<P>
The coincidence of the Christmas season with Ceausescu's downfall has provided 
powerful symbols that have brought tears to the eyes of many in this city of 2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
On the balcony of the former Communist Party Central Committee building, a 
Christmas tree bedecked in tinsel now stands. The tree marks the exact spot 
from which Ceausescu issued his final speech last Thursday, the speech that was 
interrupted by the shouts of demonstrators -- "Death, death!" -- that sounded 
the end to the dictator's long rule. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, public displays of Christmas trees were banned as part of 
Ceausescu's drive to eliminate any potential source of opposition to his reign 
-- particularly religious symbols and ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Romanian name of Santa Claus, Mos Craciun (Old Man Christmas), was 
banned by law. On Monday, however, the name was on lips across the city. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Claus Will Not Be Shot," declared a headline in the new newspaper Free 
Youth. The paper also carried a message from Teoctist, the Orthodox patriarch 
of Romania. 
</P>
<P>
"Beloved children," the patriarch wrote, "in this holiday when Christ was born 
the baby in Bethlehem, our thoughts and attention are drawn to the shining and 
fresh faces of the children and youth of Romania." 
</P>
<P>
"After many decades of official atheism," he continued, "many years of sad and 
frozen Christmases, this year is the first one in which the Christian people of 
Romania are celebrating in freedom." 
</P>
<P>
At the home of the Romanian couple -- an engineer and his wife, a doctor -- the 
celebration was simple but the spirit warm. Eight sausages, French fries, some 
tinned sardines, a stew of onions and peppers, bread, wine and a few slices of 
cake washed down by sweet coffee provided dinner for five. 
</P>
<P>
The apartment was simply furnished and sparse: three small rooms plus a kitchen 
to house the family. But the couple counts themselves among the lucky ones in 
this battered society. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the exceptions, one in a thousand," the engineer said. He noted that 
both he and his wife are relatively well paid and that his parents, both 
professionals, are in a position to guarantee them access to ever-scarce food 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
An average worker in this country earns roughly 2,000 lei a month -- $200 at 
the official exchange rate, but closer to $20 on the black market. Neither food 
nor shelter is cheap. To obtain better-paying jobs, Romanians generally have 
been required to join the nation's huge Communist Party, paying as much as 10% 
of their salary in party dues. 
</P>
<P>
The result has been a daily life here that is a grim struggle, made worse by an 
ever-present fear of surveillance that only now is beginning to fade. 
</P>
<P>
"You're being watched all the time, at home, at school, at work," said one of 
the men at dinner. "There is an old woman on my block -- she is known to be the 
security agent for the street. We always close the window facing her house 
before turning on the radio." 
</P>
<P>
For Romanians who avoid trouble with the authorities, the ultimate reward has 
been a passport allowing travel and work abroad. "We could earn $10 a day 
working in Libya," where many Romanians have been employed as oil field 
workers, said one Romanian. "You could buy some extra food, maybe a pair of 
shoes." 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, those difficult days have been laid aside in memory as the 
engineer, the doctor and their friends concentrate on the revolution unfolding 
in the streets and recorded on their television screens. 
</P>
<P>
For the last two days, those screens have been filled with images of a holiday 
that the dictatorship tried to suppress but failed to eliminate. 
</P>
<P>
Romanian television and radio have broadcast traditional Christmas carols long 
absent from public hearing but still cherished in private. The television 
screens have been full of pictures of decorated trees, monasteries and 
religious icons, and the words in Romanian that declare the message of Merry 
Christmas: "Craciun Fericit."

<TEXT>
<P>
Bush Administration officials spent Christmas Day in tense, behind-the-scenes 
negotiations with the Vatican over the fate of ousted dictator Manuel A. 
Noriega, now a refugee in the papal embassy in Panama, but insisted that they 
are determined to bring him to trial on drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
"We want him. Period," declared one White House official, a day after Noriega 
slipped into the diplomatically protected embassy compound and requested 
political asylum. "The only deal we want is that we get him physically. 
Prosecute him. The whole thing. Nobody's talking deals that I know of." 
</P>
<P>
While the Administration was pressing a hard line on bringing Noriega to 
justice, it was far from clear how they would do it. As long as the military 
leader, whose government was toppled by a U.S. military invasion force 
Wednesday, remains on diplomatically protected embassy grounds, authorities 
cannot move in to seize him. And the Vatican embassy, which has a long history 
of protecting those seeking refuge, indicated that it will not turn him over. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. military did its job," Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Monday at a 
news conference in Panama City after a visit with U.S. troops. "They ran Mr. 
Noriega to ground. At this point, the diplomats and lawyers will take over." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Noriega, who had been a fugitive for five days, drove unannounced to 
the seaside Vatican embassy and asked for sanctuary while political asylum was 
arranged in either Spain or Cuba. Madrid has indicated it would honor its 
extradition treaty with the United States, while Havana says it would grant 
Noriega asylum. 
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday, a U.S. official in Panama City indicated that the United States 
was willing to accept permanent exile in another country for Noriega because it 
would have him both out of power and out of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, by Monday, American officials were putting out the tougher line, 
apparently after a cable sent overnight from Washington to the U.S. Embassy in 
Panama ordered the shift in direction and tone. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a U.S. diplomatic team in Washington was conducting cross-continent 
negotiations by phone and through U.S. representatives to the Vatican in Rome. 
One Administration official said his colleagues were "deep in discussions" late 
Monday and were rejecting any passage for Noriega to asylum in a third country. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush and his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, conferred 
about the U.S. position at Camp David, Md., the presidential retreat where Bush 
spent the Christmas weekend, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators are "telling the Vatican that Noriega is an inappropriate 
subject for temporary refuge, and he must be removed from the embassy and 
turned over," the official said. "We're not asking for him to be extradited. 
We're only asking that they not provide sanctuary." 
</P>
<P>
Although sanctuary might be justified for political prisoners, it is not for 
criminals, U.S. officials asserted, citing Noriega's pending 1988 indictment in 
Florida on drug-trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Position 
</P>
<P>
One State Department official questioned whether the Administration's hard-line 
position will hold up. 
</P>
<P>
"While a lot of people at Justice and some at State want to see him brought 
back here for trial, I don't think it's the view (of senior officials at the 
State Department) that that's the only acceptable outcome," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to secret negotiations between Noriega and the Administration as 
recently as October on a deal for him to leave power, the official said, "Given 
that other possibilities were explored in the past, (voluntary exile) is 
probably still open." 
</P>
<P>
Also skeptical was a senior government official who said a trial could be "a 
real aggravation for the United States," in view of Noriega's former service as 
an informant for U.S. intelligence agencies. The Vatican will be in no hurry to 
make a decision in the case and may eventually arrange for him to go to a third 
country, he said, adding, "Cuba is a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Most agreed that, with highly sensitive issues at stake for both sides, no 
resolution seemed likely soon. 
</P>
<P>
"This problem will be with us for awhile," one government source said. Added 
another official: "There's not going to be any clean solution to this." 
</P>
<P>
The makings of the stalemate were put in place by the failure of the U.S. 
invasion force to capture Noriega when it stormed his military headquarters and 
Panama Defense Forces installations in multipronged attacks early Wednesday. 
The canny general managed to stay one step ahead of pursuing special forces 
teams until he appeared at the Vatican embassy on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, U.S. troops have remained on guard outside the nunciature, 
preventing Noriega from leaving. 
</P>
<P>
At the Vatican, spokesman Joaquin Navarro said that "the concerned parties" 
would examine the case as soon as possible and that Noriega's legal status was 
still being determined. Asked in a television interview whether a "simple" 
surrender of Noriega to the United States was foreseeable, he replied: "Well, I 
don't think so. There isn't an extradition treaty or anything." 
</P>
<P>
A Bush Administration official, speaking privately, said the Vatican was being 
"very legalistic . . . very responsive and responsible." 
</P>
<P>
"They're dealing with the case on the merits, but they take their law seriously 
at the Vatican," he said. "The whole issue is whether they should allow the 
embassy to be used this way. Clearly, it should not. He (Noriega) is not a 
person being persecuted for religious or political beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're using all channels, but the issue will ultimately be decided by the 
Vatican in Rome," he said, adding that U.S. government legal advisers were 
marshaling all the arguments they could find to persuade the Vatican to turn 
Noriega out of the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
One official said he thought more productive discussions might be possible 
today, with the holiday over. "You don't want to push the Vatican too hard on 
Christmas Day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said they were concerned that making a deal to allow Noriega to 
become an exile in another country would cause serious repercussions both in 
the United States and in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodating a notorious international drug defendant could cause a hot 
political backlash. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of us realize trying him could be an aggravation, but an even worse 
aggravation would be if we somehow were involved in his not coming to the 
United States for trial," one official said. "We would never be forgiven for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a free Noriega could provide inspiration to his loyalists in 
Panama to fight on. "Until Noriega is brought to justice, some of his 
supporters will assume that the great man will come back," said one source. 
</P>
<P>
One possible compromise could involve releasing him to the custody of the new 
Panamanian government of Guillermo Endara. Under the Panamanian constitution, 
he then could not be extradited to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Few Options 
</P>
<P>
But, even if negotiations became flexible, options for relocating Noriega 
appear limited, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Spain and the Dominican Republic -- cited as possible places of exile in 
previous U.S. talks with Noriega -- pose significant problems. On Monday, 
Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez said that because of the 
extradition treaty with the United States, Spain would have to hand Noriega 
over to U.S. officials if he appeared there. And the Dominican Republic is 
close enough to Panama to allow Noriega to stir an insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond Takiff, Noriega's attorney in Miami, said U.S. authorities should 
consider that prosecution of the ousted strongman in the United States might 
threaten national security by resulting in sensitive information being divulged 
about his long association with the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega was indicted Feb. 4, 1988, in Miami and Tampa, Fla., on racketeering, 
drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges. 
</P>
<P>
One senior government official acknowledged that prosecuting Noriega would 
present the Bush Administration with at last two major problems: a lack of 
strong evidence that Noriega is guilty as charged and the probability that he 
would demand secret CIA documents to defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never paid enough attention to the evidence in the case," the official 
said. "We don't have any doubt about his guilt. But convicting him in the media 
is one thing and convicting him in a court of law is another. Another 
troublesome thing is he would use the old CIA defense and probably could hit on 
something they couldn't produce." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Panamanian Lt. Col. Luis A. del Cid surrendered to authorities in 
Panama on Monday and was put on a plane bound for Miami, where he will be 
arraigned on cocaine-smuggling charges, said David Runkel, chief spokesman for 
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Del Cid is the first of five top aides to Noriega to be taken into custody on 
the federal drug-smuggling charges filed in Florida against Noriega and 16 
associates. 
</P>
<P>
Del Cid, commander of the 1,000-man 5th Military Region in Panama, was 
Noriega's personal secretary for more than a decade.

A Panamanian officer indicted along with deposed dictator Manuel A. Noriega on 
drug-related charges was escorted to Miami on Monday by U.S. drug enforcement 
agents, the Justice Department announced. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Luis del Cid, a Noriega loyalist who commanded a Panama Defense Forces 
unit in the province of Chiriqui, gave himself up to U.S. forces in Panama, 
spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
Del Cid was one of 15 Noriega associates indicted in February, 1988, by a 
federal grand jury in Miami. He is wanted on four counts related to cocaine 
possession and laundering of drug profits, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
After turning himself in, Del Cid was arrested by agents of the Drug 
Enforcement Administration in Panama, she said. 
</P>
<P>
DEA agents escorted him to Miami. "Normally, he would have been flown in by 
U.S. marshals, but this was not an ordinary case," she said. 
</P>
<P>
A federal official in Miami, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Del Cid 
probably will be arraigned before a magistrate in Miami today but would not 
comment further.

Manuel Blanco rummaged through the ashes that had been his home and salvaged a 
hammer with a charred handle and a blackened pair of pliers. 
</P>
<P>
The two tools and the clothes on his back were what remained of his earthly 
possessions. Even so, the 70-year-old retired auto mechanic said he is glad 
U.S. forces invaded Panama and overthrew the dictatorship of Gen. Manuel A. 
Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts that I've lost everything, but what are you going to do? The gringos 
had to do it like they did. I only wish they would have done it long ago," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He stood on blackened sheets of corrugated tin that had been the roof of the 
two-story wooden apartment building where he lived with his wife and their 
granddaughter. The only remnants of the building were two masonry columns that 
supported the communal bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Blanco and his neighbors had the misfortune to live a block from the 
headquarters of the Panama Defense Forces, Noriega's command center. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. tanks and rocket-firing helicopters destroyed the military headquarters 
before dawn Wednesday. The barrage sparked fires that raced through housing in 
the working-class Chorrillo neighborhood, creating at least 20,000 refugees. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has more right to speak than we do, the ones hurt most by the attack," 
said Ruben Camargo, 37, standing in front of his ruined home. Camargo, a 
goldsmith, was luckier than Blanco in that he lived with his wife and two 
children in a more substantial cinder-block structure. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. forces evacuated the area at daybreak Wednesday, hours after the assault 
began. 
</P>
<P>
Camargo said his 4-year-old daughter was traumatized by the hours of fire and 
bombing, and she wakes up crying during the night. 
</P>
<P>
"One single person is guilty of all this. So much death because of one man, and 
that man's name is Manuel Antonio Noriega," said Camargo when asked if he 
resents the invaders. 
</P>
<P>
Of a dozen Chorrillo residents interviewed, all applauded the U.S. action. 
</P>
<P>
The closest thing to criticism was voiced by taxi driver Bolivar Escobar, 32, 
standing in his flooded home on the ground floor of a destroyed housing block. 
Most of his family's possessions were destroyed or stolen. He salvaged a red 
cape embroidered with silver trim -- a costume that his 11-year-old daughter 
had worn. 
</P>
<P>
"The invasion itself was correct; the form, no," he said. "They should have 
come with much more personnel to establish positions corner by corner to 
prevent looting. And they could have used less shelling. A lot of people died 
in their sleep. Now we have to start from zero," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital authorities estimated between 200 and 300 people were killed in the 
invasion, at least half of them civilians. Hundreds more were injured. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the only way to get him (Noriega) out," Camargo said. "He could have 
quit and given us all the gift of a happy Christmas, not this bitter Christmas 
we're having."

PANAMA: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; 
</P>
<P>
STINER -- 'RIGHT GUY' TO LEAD COMPLEX INVASION OF PANAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Lt. Gen. Carl W. Stiner led the U.S. invasion of Panama last week, few 
among his admirers and critics were surprised. 
</P>
<P>
The three-star Army general may be a slow-talking country boy from eastern 
Tennessee, but he has been in the center of many high-risk military actions in 
recent years, including the dramatic capture of the hijackers of the cruise 
ship Achille Lauro in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"They couldn't have found a better guy to do it," said retired Gen. Edward C. 
Meyer, former Army chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got direct experience in special operations, airborne, mechanized 
infantry. He served in Lebanon. He's the right guy for this kind of intermixing 
of special operations and conventional forces," Meyer said of Stiner, who is 
base commander of Ft. Bragg, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
"He comes across like Jimmy Stewart," another retired general added. "Stiner 
doesn't get real excited. He has a lot of patience." 
</P>
<P>
Such unflappability served Stiner well on Oct. 10, 1985, at the Sigonella Air 
Base in Sicily, moments after U.S. Navy F-14 fighter jets had forced down an 
EgyptAir plane carrying several of Achille Lauro's hijackers. As commander of 
the operation, Stiner flew aboard one of the Navy jets. 
</P>
<P>
Once on the ground, amid great tension and confusion over custody of the 
hijackers, a squabble between Italian and American soldiers quickly escalated 
into a near-brawl. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a sizable group and there were pretty good fisticuffs going on," 
recalled one knowledgeable military source. "But Stiner was able to calm the 
situation and bring it under control." 
</P>
<P>
However, the same source who praised Stiner's handling of that incident also 
added: 
</P>
<P>
"He's not particularly bright. He's gone a long way without a lot of 
equipment," the source said. He charged that Stiner's lack of appreciation for 
the complexities of Middle East politics may have been a factor in the heavy 
loss of life in the suicide bombing of the Marine headquarters in Beirut in 
1983. The terrorist attack killed 241 U.S. servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
During his brief stint there as the representative of the chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, Stiner in late 1983 recommended that the battleship New Jersey 
open fire on Muslim militias -- even though, his critics have noted, no 
Americans were in immediate danger. 
</P>
<P>
The subsequent U.S. shelling of Muslim areas destroyed American credibility and 
neutrality in Lebanon. Just over a month later, a suicide bomber in an 
explosives-laden truck leveled the Marines headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
However, former National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane said that blaming 
Stiner for the bombing is "a bum rap." 
</P>
<P>
"It's true that he reported that the Marines were vulnerable and (recommended) 
that they be reinforced by gunfire," said McFarlane, then the presidential 
trouble-shooter on the scene. But the final decision to shell the militias was 
made by President Ronald Reagan, McFarlane noted in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
He and others described Stiner as an officer with uncommon concern for his 
troops -- to the point of advising young soldiers on family planning and 
budgeting. "The guy's very conscious of the relationship between stability at 
home and performance on the field," McFarlane said. 
</P>
<P>
Stiner was born in LaFollette, Tenn. He has a bachelor's degree in agriculture 
from Tennessee Polytechnical Institute and a master's degree in public 
administration from Shippensburg State College, Pa. He obtained his officer's 
commission through the ROTC.

<P>
He basked as sycophants proclaimed him the "Genius of the Carpathians," but 
Nicolae Ceausescu will be remembered instead as the doddering tyrant whose 
incomprehensible belief that he could stay the same while all around him 
changed finally cost him his life. 
</P>
<P>
Even as he carefully crafted an image of independence from his neighbors in 
what used to be called the Soviet Bloc, the longtime Romanian leader built a 
family dynasty and ruthlessly insisted on unquestioning obedience from his own 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
As a decade and an era ended in Eastern Europe -- as 90 million people in 
country after country rejected one party dictatorship under the approving eye 
of the Kremlin -- Ceausescu's only response was to suggest a military 
intervention to preserve the old ways. 
</P>
<P>
He earned most of his once favorable Western image by refusing to join in the 
Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, but by 1989 he was ready to 
help shoot down Solidarity supporters in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
By all indications, he truly believed he could keep his impoverished nation of 
23 million somehow apart from the most extraordinary year of peacetime change 
in Europe since "the springtime of the nations" in 1848. 
</P>
<P>
And when his moment of clarity came -- when an angry crowd did the unthinkable 
and shouted him down during another cliche-ridden speech in Bucharest last 
Friday -- all he could do was stare slack-jawed, a bewildered old man about to 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone was happy about the way Ceausescu, who would have been 72 next 
month, and his equally dictatorial wife, Elena, were said to have met their 
ends. The leaders of Romania's 11-day-old popular uprising had at first pledged 
an open trial that would have provided a clear break from the lynch law imposed 
for 24 years by the man they overthrew. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, according to the official announcement, Romania's new leaders also 
resorted to a secret trial and summary executions, citing, among other reasons, 
the 60,000 killings for which they held his regime responsible. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever he once was, Ceausescu became not so much a rigidly orthodox Communist 
as a cruel and calculating medieval potentate. 
</P>
<P>
Critics saw his vaunted refusal to march to the Kremlin's drumbeat as mostly a 
sham designed to boost his stature as a world statesman and to cater to his 
countrymen's resentment of Moscow for annexing a large chunk of what was once 
Romania and turning it into the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the West applauded as Ceausescu refused to allow Soviet troops to be 
stationed in Romania, maintained relations with Israel, criticized the Soviet 
intervention in Afghanistan, and defied a Warsaw Pact boycott by sending his 
athletes to the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth knighted him, and the United States extended his country 
most-favored-nation trade status, choosing to overlook the fact that he 
maintained his power at home through a cruel security apparatus rivaled only by 
that of North Korea's Kim Il Sung. 
</P>
<P>
It was said that wherever three or more Romanians gathered, at least one was 
reporting to the Securitate secret police. It was estimated that at least one 
in every 30 citizens was either in jail, internal exile, or otherwise legally 
restricted in some way. His was a country in which a citizen had to apply for a 
police permit to own a typewriter. 
</P>
<P>
The United States finally withdrew his "most favored" trade status last year, 
and on the day he was deposed last week, Buckingham Palace also withdrew his 
knighthood. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if it had been a mistake not to cancel the honor sooner, the British 
government's Foreign Office minister in charge of Eastern Europe, William 
Waldegrave, said the hope at the time was "that signs of independence from the 
Soviet line in foreign policy might be followed by signs of independence in 
terms of the internal policies. I don't think that was an unreasonable hope, 
but it was severely disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
While both the West and Ceausescu may have seen his contributions in foreign 
policy as more valuable than they really were, at least one of them did 
contribute to a breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
Former Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin credited the Romanian leader with 
mediating the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's historic 1977 peace mission 
to Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Begin said in an interview after his retirement that during a visit to 
Bucharest he had asked Ceausescu if he could persuade Sadat "to come visit us." 
Ceausescu later convinced Sadat of Begin's desire for peace with Egypt, which 
cleared the way for the Jerusalem visit, the Israeli leader stated. 
</P>
<P>
While he refused to participate in the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of 
Czechoslovakia, there was never any danger that he would follow Alexander 
Dubcek's lead and try to give Romanian socialism a "human face." 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, his rule was often likened to that of the late Soviet 
dictator, Josef Stalin. And like Stalin, he had become the venerated object of 
a "cult of personality." 
</P>
<P>
He was vain and imperious, despite his unimpressive appearance. He was 5 feet, 
6 inches tall with a stocky physique and a manner that was far from 
charismatic. The ubiquitous portraits of him which graced offices, schools, 
factories, farms and cities were invariably of the vigorous and dark-haired man 
who, at 47, was the youngest leader to have at that time ever come to power in 
a Warsaw Pact country -- not of the aging president of later years. 
</P>
<P>
He basked in the adulation that was reflected in the slogan, 
"Ceausescu-Romania-Peace." He was described in one paean of praise as "the 
supreme embodiment of good." In one speech, a Romanian politician likened 
Ceausescu to Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, Napoleon, Peter the Great, 
Abraham Lincoln and other major historical figures. 
</P>
<P>
Included among his titles were "Hero of Heroes," "Worker of Workers" and "First 
Personage of the World." Although he was a staunch atheist who suppressed 
religion in Romania, Ceausescu was hailed as "Our Lay God." His daily schedule 
was the lead item on the evening television news, and bookstores and newspapers 
were filled with works about the revered leader. 
</P>
<P>
He insisted on the deference he felt was his due, and was occasionally 
embroiled in diplomatic flaps with foreign hosts who he felt did not roll out a 
big enough red carpet for his visits. 
</P>
<P>
The adulation, whether generated by Ceausescu or his sycophants, reached 
comical proportions at times, such as in January, 1988, when the British 
government complained that the Romanians had fabricated a glowing message from 
Queen Elizabeth II to Ceausescu on his 70th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
High Praise 
</P>
<P>
The message, published in a Romanian weekly, praised Ceausescu "as a statesman 
of world stature with widely recognized experience and influence." 
</P>
<P>
Britain angrily informed the Romanian ambassador that the Queen had sent no 
such message and that London considered such behavior "an insult to her 
majesty." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the adulation wore thin in a nation plagued by food and other shortages 
under a harsh austerity program designed to reduce Romania's huge foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu sought to reduce the debt by demanding payment from Israel and West 
Germany for permitting Romanian Jews and ethnic Germans to emigrate, according 
to Ion Pacepa, once one of Ceausescu's closest aides who defected to the United 
States in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Pacepa, former deputy chief of the Romanian Intelligence Service, quoted 
Ceausescu as saying at one time, "Oil, Jews and Germans are our most important 
export commodities." 
</P>
<P>
He said the "basis price" for emigres was $20,000 to $50,000, depending on the 
individual's education and accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
The money, Pacepa maintained, was deposited in Ceausescu's personal account. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu engaged in blatant nepotism that prompted critics to refer to his 
regime as a Socialist dynasty. His wife, a one-time worker in a textile plant, 
who earned a reputation as a stern and puritanical watchdog over Communist 
morality, was a member of the ruling Politburo and first deputy prime minister. 
Considered the second most important person in the nation, she had virtual 
control over party membership. 
</P>
<P>
Like her husband over whom she reportedly wielded great influence, Elena 
Ceausescu was eulogized. She was called a "model to be followed by all women in 
our country." She was "the legendary mother," and "the most just woman on 
earth." 
</P>
<P>
The Ceausescus' two sons, Valentin, and Nicu, and a daughter, Zoia, all held 
important party or government posts. 
</P>
<P>
Nicu was arrested last Friday and Zoia on Sunday, and both were shown on 
Romanian television. It is unclear what has happened to them since, and the 
fate of Valentin Ceausescu is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of Ceausescu's relatives were named members of the Communist Party 
Central Committee, and his five brothers held senior positions in the army, 
party, and government. In all, about 50 relatives of either Nicolae or Elena 
Ceausescu were in senior posts before he was deposed. 
</P>
<P>
A Communist since his early teens, Ceausescu was born on Jan. 26, 1918, about 
100 miles northwest of Bucharest in the farming village of Scornicesti, which 
became a national shrine. He came from a family of poor peasants. His father 
reportedly was a shoemaker. 
</P>
<P>
He received only an elementary education, and in 1932, at the age of 14, he 
joined a workers' movement. A year later he joined the Union of Communist Youth 
and quickly became known as an effective activist. In 1936 he was admitted to 
the outlawed Communist Party at a time when Romania was torn by unrest among 
peasants and industrial workers. Romania was then ruled by a Fascist 
dictatorship under King Carol II. 
</P>
<P>
The same year he joined the party, Ceausescu was arrested and sentenced to 2 
1/2 years in prison for "agitation." A former fellow inmate remembers Ceausescu 
as "a skinny kid who rarely said a word. He didn't whine when they (prison 
officials) kicked him. He didn't smile when they fed him." 
</P>
<P>
It was at the Doftana prison, which also became a national shrine, that 
Ceausescu met Gheirghe Gheorghiu-Dej who was then serving a 12-year term for 
his role in a railroad workers' strike. In prison, Ceausescu also met several 
other inmates who became senior officials in the post-World War II Communist 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
After his release, Ceausescu continued his underground activity, and in 1940 
was made a member of the Central Committee responsible for work among youth. 
That year, convicted in absentia, Ceausescu was again imprisoned, this time for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1944, as Soviet forces were advancing into Romania, which was then 
an ally of Nazi Germany, Ceausescu, Gheorghiu-Dej and several other Communist 
prisoners escaped. 
</P>
<P>
During the same month, Romania's pro-Nazi government was overthrown and the new 
government declared war on Germany, then heading for certain defeat. 
</P>
<P>
After the end of the war in 1945, Ceausescu was given important positions in 
the party, along with the rank of brigadier general. Having spent his entire 
career in Romania, Ceausescu was a member of the home Communist faction as 
opposed to the "Muscovites" who had spent the war in the Soviet Union and 
returned to Romania with the Soviet troops. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate postwar period was marked by struggles between the "Muscovites" 
and home Communist factions as well as their combined struggle against the 
government headed by King Michael, King Carol II's successor. The king 
abdicated in 1947 and the Romania People's Republic was established. The 
country was later renamed the Socialist Republic of Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Official 
</P>
<P>
From 1948 until 1950, Ceausescu served as deputy minister of agriculture in the 
government formed by the Popular Democratic Front, a coalition of various 
Socialist, Communist and agrarian parties. For the next four years, Ceausescu 
was deputy minister of the armed forces with the rank of major general. 
</P>
<P>
During this period the military Muscovite faction leader Ana Pauka, who was 
vice premier and minister of foreign affairs and held the real source of power, 
was purged, along with other officials for "deviations." Gheorghiu-Dej took 
over the premiership while retaining his post as party leader. 
</P>
<P>
As Gheorghiu-Dej's protege, Ceausescu moved swiftly to the top. He was named a 
full member of the ruling Politburo in 1955. In line with his mentor's 
independent-minded policies, Ceausescu helped remove pro-Moscow apparatchiks in 
the ranks of the party. 
</P>
<P>
For a brief period after his mentor's death in 1965, Ceausescu shared power 
with Chivu Stocia, who as president of the State Council was titular head of 
state 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu later took over Stocia's post and became sole ruler of Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu reaffirmed Gheorghiu-Dej's policy of strict neutrality in the bitter 
ideological dispute between the Soviet Union and China. 
</P>
<P>
He infuriated his East Bloc allies, especially East Germany, by being the first 
bloc leader to establish diplomatic relations, in 1967, with West Germany, 
Bucharest's major Western trading partner. He also was the first to play host 
to an American President, Richard M. Nixon in 1969, and he also was visited by 
Gerald R. Ford, when he was the U.S. President. 
</P>
<P>
Broke With Allies 
</P>
<P>
Following the 1967 Middle East War, Romania refused to go along with the Soviet 
Union and the other East Bloc states in breaking relations with Israel. He 
sought to play the part of honest broker between Israel and the Arabs, 
declaring: "We do not share the position of those circles which speak in favor 
of the liquidation of the state of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
While remaining a loyal partner of the Warsaw Pact, though objecting to some of 
his policies, such as Soviet calls for increased military spending, Ceausescu 
repeatedly urged the abolition of both the Communist alliance and the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
And he repeately resisted Soviet efforts to tighten the Kremlin's control over 
Warsaw Pact forces. "We shall never and under no circumstances place the 
Romania army under another command but that of our party and state," he said in 
1978 after a meeting in Moscow on military affairs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, after the Soviets walked out of the nuclear arms talks in Geneva with 
the United States in protest over the deployment of new American missiles in 
Europe, Ceausescu called on both sides to reduce such deployments. 
</P>
<P>
In domestic affairs, Ceausescu followed the Stalinist concept of rigid central 
planning and control, and a determined drive to industrialize the country. He 
employed forced labor for the country's ambitious industrial projects such as 
the Danube-Black Sea Canal. 
</P>
<P>
For all that he gloried in the increasingly feigned adulation of his people, 
Ceausescu actually feared that he would be contaminated by them, according to 
defector Pacepa. After shaking hands with ordinary citizens, Pacepa said, the 
Romanian leader would wash his hands with alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
And by the end, few in his country rued his passing. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, what wonderful news!" enthused an unidentified announcer on Radio 
Bucharest. "The Anti-Christ died on Christmas Day!"

POPE PRAYS FOR AN E. EUROPE 'AWAKENED FROM A NIGHTMARE'

VATICAN CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The triumph and tragedy of dramatic change in an Eastern Europe "awakened from 
a nightmare" dominated Christmas at the Holy See on Monday, with Pope John Paul 
II praying for East-West cooperation to build a peaceful Continent without 
frontiers. 
</P>
<P>
Television viewers in the Soviet Union, East Germany, Yugoslavia and the Pope's 
native Poland joined with millions in more than four dozen other countries on 
five continents to watch John Paul celebrate midnight Mass and to deliver his 
Christmas Urbi et Orbi message from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica. 
</P>
<P>
Excited pilgrims from around the world and tens of thousands of Romans 
surrounded a 90-foot Austrian Christmas tree and flanked a larger-than-life 
Nativity scene in the gigantic square before St. Peter's to hear the 
traditional papal message "To the City and the World." 
</P>
<P>
John Paul offered a special blessing for Romania, the only one of the reforming 
East European nations where violence has accompanied change. 
</P>
<P>
"In particular, bless at this hour, O Lord, the noble land of Romania, which is 
celebrating this Christmas in fear and trembling, with sorrow for the many 
human lives tragically lost, and in the joy of having taken once more the path 
of freedom," John Paul prayed. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in gold robes high above the cheerful crowd at the headquarters 
cathedral for the world's 850 million Catholics, the Pope appealed for "the 
rejection of all barriers, be they of race, ideology or intolerance." 
</P>
<P>
As East Europeans and nations gripped by decades of dictatorship savored their 
first free Christmas since the start of World War II, John Paul called on 
Western Europe "to open her doors and her hearts" to help them. 
</P>
<P>
"May she respond with the strength and generosity of her Christian roots to 
this very special moment of history, which the world is now experiencing, as if 
awakened from a nightmare, and opened up to a better hope," the Pope prayed on 
a clear, almost spring-like day. 
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented interview with Italian television broadcast on Christmas 
Eve, John Paul observed that Eastern Europeans are "finally emerging as 
winners" after what he called "extraordinary events" beginning "in my Poland." 
</P>
<P>
Revolution in the East, together with the promise of re-established links to 
the Soviet Union following the visit of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to the 
Vatican earlier this month, are regarded here as major steps toward an 
oft-expressed papal dream of a Europe united by Christian ideals. 
</P>
<P>
In his Christmas message to cardinals of the church on the state of the world, 
John Paul pledged support for a frontier-free Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no ideological system, political project, economic program or 
military system that can cancel the aspirations of millions of men and women," 
the Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the 69-year-old pontiff reminded the festive crowd at St. Peter's on 
Monday, 2,000 years after the birth of a babe in a manger worshiped by much of 
the world as the Prince of Peace, that there is still much healing to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"The world longs for peace, yet every day our brothers and sisters are dying in 
the present conflicts, in Lebanon, in the Holy Land, in Central America; they 
are dying in fratricidal struggles for supremacy, racial, ideological, 
economic; they are dying because of senseless and reckless courses of action," 
John Paul lamented.

Millions of Eastern Europeans celebrated their first free Christmas in four 
decades: political prisoners rejoined their families, East Germans and 
Czechoslovaks watched Mass on TV and Romanians listened to long-banned carols 
on state radio. 
</P>
<P>
Crowds milled around Berlin's newly reopened Brandenburg Gate, symbol of the 
division of both Germany and Europe. East Germans also watched their first Mass 
on television, as Pope John Paul II delivered his traditional Christmas message 
in 53 languages from St. Peter's Square in Rome. Many of his remarks were aimed 
at Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Church bells pealed across Czechoslovakia to mark the new freedoms won in a 
pro-democracy movement that toppled Communist leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like this is a miracle," said Ivan M. Jirous, 45, who was reunited with 
his family after being imprisoned for more than eight years for "subversive" 
acts. 
</P>
<P>
On Prague's 15th-Century Charles Bridge, young carolers sang haunting, 
traditional Christmas melodies. In previous years, police chased carolers from 
the broad, cobbled King's Road. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the sounds of gunfire on the streets of Bucharest were the sounds of 
Christmas songs and carols, broadcast by Radio Bucharest for the first time 
since the Communist takeover of Romania in December, 1947. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union's Baltic republics enjoyed the first official Christmas 
holiday allowed by the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
And in Bethlehem, Christians from around the world prayed at the site of Jesus' 
birth, but it was a subdued Christmas overshadowed by the two-year-old 
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories.

FIGHTING: IONEL ANTIMIE WAS DELIVERING AID TO FRIENDS. HIS FAMILY BELIEVES HE 
WAS SHOT BY FORCES LOYAL TO CEAUSESCU.

<P>
A 21-year-old man who fled his native Romania for Orange County four years ago 
but who returned last week with a brother to visit his girlfriend and bring 
medical supplies for friends and relatives was reportedly shot to death, his 
family said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
On a grim Christmas Day, the family of Ionel (John) Antimie waited anxiously at 
their home in Fullerton for further word from friends or family members in 
Romania, where continued fighting made communication difficult if not 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
But they already believe the worst. 
</P>
<P>
"He is gone," said one cousin who joined about a dozen other relatives at 
Antimie's house Sunday after hearing the report. "All that is left are the 
pictures." 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Philip Covington said U.S. officials cannot confirm 
the incident but are investigating it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're taking the report very seriously," Covington said. "We're looking into 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Ionel Antimie helped run a family construction business in Fullerton with his 
father, Ion, and several brothers, among them Constantine, 32, who traveled to 
Romania with him. Ionel Antimie was a four-year resident of the city but not 
yet a U.S. citizen. 
</P>
<P>
No U.S. citizens have been reported killed in the recent spate of violence that 
has accompanied the overthrow of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. The U.S. 
government does not normally track injuries or deaths to American residents who 
are not citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"The welfare and safety of U.S. citizens is our highest priority," Covington 
said. The whereabouts of a U.S. resident such as Antimie, he said, "would be a 
little bit lower on our priority list." 
</P>
<P>
The brothers' family said they are convinced that Antimie was gunned down by 
Ceausescu security forces. Their belief, they said, is based on a phone call 
they received Sunday from a friend who had been in touch with Constantine. 
</P>
<P>
The two brothers left Orange County nine days ago, before public reports of the 
massacre of protesters by Ceausescu forces and the subsequent outbreak of some 
of Europe's worst urban warfare since World War II. Ionel Antimie had been 
planning to visit his girlfriend, Angelica Hij, 16, a resident of the city of 
Cluj. 
</P>
<P>
But as the chaos erupted in Romania, the brothers changed their plans, family 
members said. As they waited in Germany, the two gathered food and medical 
supplies -- "thousands of dollars" worth, according to their father, who spoke 
with them before they left Germany. Then they entered Romania, apparently from 
Yugoslavia, with plans to offer what aid they could to friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The men's father said he was worried about his sons' entering Romania but that 
"I accepted it because the people needed food and medicine." 
</P>
<P>
The family said they believe that Ionel and Constantine were driving to Cluj 
over the weekend when their rental car was ordered to stop by security forces 
still loyal to Ceausescu. They believe, they said, that the uniformed police 
shot Ionel Antimie but that Constantine was able to jump from the car and flee. 
</P>
<P>
Constantine reportedly told friends in Portland, who were able to get a call 
through to Romania, that he returned to the site of the shooting with friends 
and retrieved his brother's body. 
</P>
<P>
Ion Antimie, who also lives in Fullerton, said that this Christmas, already 
soured by the reports of widespread bloodshed in his homeland, was "the worst 
and the most sorrowful day of my life."

ROMANIA: DEATH OF A DICTATOR;

JOY, SADNESS MARK DEMONSTRATION BY ROMANIAN EXPATRIATES IN L.A.

Strong and mixed emotions dominated a small demonstration by Romanian 
expatriates at Los Angeles City Hall on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Joy that Nicolae Ceausescu had been deposed as dictator of their homeland 
combined with sorrow that apparently tens of thousands have died in the 
process. Hope for a new democratic government was diluted by outrage at the 
rumored presence of Libyan and Syrian mercenaries fighting on the side of 
Ceausescu's police. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 of the approximately 11,000 Romanians living in the Los Angeles area 
gathered to hold lighted candles and red, blue and yellow Romanian flags -- 
conspicuously lacking the green Communist insignia in the center. 
</P>
<P>
They chanted "Kadafi out of Romania!" and carried signs with such messages as 
"Ceausescu Anti-Christ is Dead. Ho, ho, ho." 
</P>
<P>
Virgil Anastasiu, a Panorama City resident who defected from a Romanian 
merchant ship 3 1/2 years ago, said a private execution was too good for 
Ceausescu. "Everybody should take a piece of his skin, like they did the Berlin 
Wall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Relief Fund is collecting money, food and clothing and will turn 
all donations over to the Red Cross, spokesman Sergio Onaga said. The mailing 
address is: 7250 Bandini Blvd., Unit 111, City of Commerce 90040. Further 
information can be obtained by calling (213) 724-8360 or (213) 724-8362.

IRAN REPORTS RELEASING 50 AILING IRAQI CAPTIVES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Iran on Monday released 50 ailing or disabled Iraqi prisoners of war as a 
gesture of good will, Tehran radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether Iraq would release some Iranian POWs in return. An 
earlier attempt to arrange an exchange was unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
The broadcast said that the prisoners were released to Red Cross 
representatives in Tehran for eventual repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying that 
the 50 were freed for humanitarian reasons and in response to a request from 
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. 
</P>
<P>
It did not say when Perez de Cuellar made the appeal. Baghdad last week sent 
him a memorandum expressing concern for POWs held in Iran after the Red Cross 
reported on Dec. 6 that 22 Iraqis had died in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The deaths were attributed to "heart attacks and relevant diseases," but Iraqi 
media suggested that the prisoners might have been tortured. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross knows of about 50,000 prisoners held by Iran and more than 19,200 
in Iraqi camps. U.N. officials and diplomats had estimated the number of 
captives at about 100,000 overall. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross obtained an agreement for the return of ailing prisoners 
immediately after a U.N. cease-fire halted the war on Aug. 20, 1988. That deal 
fell through, however, after 400 disabled and wounded prisoners had been 
exchanged. Both sides accused each other of falsifying the number of captives 
seeking asylum with their captors. 
</P>
<P>
Angelo Gnadinger, Middle East chief for the Red Cross, visited Tehran and 
Baghdad last week, seeking to arrange for release of the remaining 1,000 
wounded and disabled men still held on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
That effort collapsed, mainly because Tehran insisted that the exchange be 
coupled with a withdrawal of Iraqi forces from territory captured in the final 
weeks of the war. 
</P>
<P>
U.N.-sponsored peace talks have been deadlocked, mainly because of the troop 
withdrawal issue and Iraq's demand that the border be redrawn to give it 
sovereignty over the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway. 
</P>
<P>
The channel, a confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, is Iraq's sole 
outlet to the Persian Gulf. Before the war, it formed the border between Iran 
and Iraq.

IGNORING CEASE-FIRE PLEA, SHIITE FACTIONS FIGHT ON IN LEBANON

<P>
Rival Shiite Muslim militiamen, ignoring cease-fire pleas from their Syrian and 
Iranian sponsors, battled in south Lebanon Monday for a third day, and at least 
eight people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Men of the Syrian-backed Amal, advancing under a hail of artillery and rocket 
fire, tried to retake three villages captured earlier by the pro-Iranian 
Hezbollah, security sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah fighters, dug into trenches and fortified emplacements, repelled the 
attacks with heavy machine-gun, rocket and mortar fire and then tried to 
advance on Amal-held territory. 
</P>
<P>
At least eight people were killed and 40 wounded, the sources said, raising the 
toll in three days of fighting to at least 35 killed and 150 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's ambassador to Syria, Mohammed Akhtari, had announced earlier that the 
two Shiite militias had agreed to observe a cease-fire as of late Sunday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
He was speaking after meetings in Damascus among Iran's First Deputy Foreign 
Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati, Syrian officials and leaders of Amal and 
Hezbollah, rivals for control over Lebanon's 1.5 million Shiites. 
</P>
<P>
The two militias blamed each other for the fighting in the strategic Iqlim 
al-Tufah region between the southern Lebanese port of Sidon and Israel's 
self-declared south Lebanon security zone. Hundreds of villagers have fled the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
An Amal statement said it would negotiate only after Hezbollah withdrew from 
the positions it had captured. Hezbollah said it was ready to start an 
unconditional dialogue with Amal immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that, although no positions changed hands Monday, 
Hezbollah appeared to have gained the upper hand in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah -- trained, financed and equipped by Iran -- seized the villages of 
Bouslayah, Kfar Fila and Ain Qana in a pre-dawn assault Saturday on Amal 
strongholds. 
</P>
<P>
Security sources said Hezbollah took the village of Jarjouh Sunday, but Amal 
sources strongly denied the report. 
</P>
<P>
The fundamentalist Hezbollah and the moderate Amal have waged on-and-off 
battles for the last two years. Amal, the largest Muslim militia, regards south 
Lebanon as its preserve and says Hezbollah should have no active role there. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, dedicated to fighting Israel to the finish, needs a foothold in the 
area to launch guerrilla attacks against the Jewish state and its security 
zone.

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was expected to travel to Syria today, a sign 
of improvement in relations between the two Arab nations, which have been at 
odds since Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, a Beirut daily 
newspaper reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The leftist As-Safir newspaper, quoting Arab sources in Cairo, said that 
Mubarak would pay a two-day visit to Syria starting today and would meet with 
President Hafez Assad. 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's expected visit to Damascus followed talks with Syrian Vice President 
Abdel-Halim Khaddam held in Cairo on Saturday, the sources said. Khaddam 
delivered a message from Assad to Mubarak during his 24-hour trip to Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-Syrian ties started to warm last year after Cairo recognized a 
Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip declared by 
Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Syria 
considers itself a defender of the Palestinian cause.

CHRISTMAS DAY COLDEST EVER IN PARTS OF U.S. 
</P>

<P>
Forecasters said Monday may have been the coldest Christmas ever in Florida as 
freezing temperatures destroyed an estimated 40% of citrus and vegetable crops 
and power outages delayed holiday dinners and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, temperatures headed into the 50s and 60s after a mass of arctic air 
had smashed low-temperature records and destroyed about 60% of the citrus crop 
there. Fruit growers fear that trees also may be damaged or lost, state 
agriculture officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At Harlingen, Tex., citrus grower Joe Kutzenberger said no fruit that was not 
harvested before Friday and Saturday's cold can be salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second straight day that Florida's $3.5-billion citrus industry was 
ravaged by cold. Wind was light Christmas Eve, meaning groves that escaped 
unharmed the previous night suffered freeze damage. Stiffer wind prevents frost 
from settling on the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently there is a lot of iced fruit," said Dick Whalley, a spokesman for 
Florida Citrus Mutual, the state's big grower cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
More snow fell on the Deep South, and Florida utilities asked people to turn 
off holiday decorations to save electricity for heat. 
</P>
<P>
Florida Power &amp; Light imposed rolling blackouts of up to 30 minutes in 
length and braced for a possible increase in demand with the opening of many 
businesses today. "The records only go back to '42, and this was the coldest 
Christmas since 1942," said meteorologist Noel Risnychok of the National 
Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
On the resort island of St. Simons along the south Georgia coast, residents 
reveled in the rare snow, cross-country skiing on beaches and body surfing on 
Boogie boards in snow-covered parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Many homes in Charleston, S.C., were without water Monday because of a water 
main break. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature fell to a record low of zero at the Wilmington, N.C., airport, 
where a record 15 inches of snow fell Sunday. The previous record low at 
Wilmington of 5 above had stood since February, 1899. 
</P>
<P>
Two of North Carolina's three main natural gas companies asked consumers to 
turn down their heat Monday to ease demand on tight supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Other record daily lows Monday, all in Florida, were 29 at Ft. Lauderdale, 46 
at Key West and a record-tying 33 at Miami Beach, the National Weather Service 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The East and Midwest received a welcome gift from Mother Nature early Monday as 
a stubborn cold spell loosened its deadly grip. 
</P>
<P>
Although much of the Midwest enjoyed a white Christmas, temperatures in some 
areas climbed into the 40s and 50s, well above the record chills of last week. 
</P>
<P>
In New England, a massive arctic high-pressure system responsible for record 
low temperatures slowly weakened, but temperatures remained bitterly cold. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the cold prevented the annual re-enactment of George Washington's 
famous Revolutionary War crossing of the Delaware River to capture British 
troops at Trenton, N.J. "We couldn't get our four boats into the river because 
it was a sheet of ice," said James Gallagher, who has played the role of 
Washington since 1985.

The Coast Guard will test a new system for tracking oil tankers in Alaska's 
Prince William Sound, site of the nation's worst oil spill. It will utilize 
satellite signals and long-range aids to navigation rather than radar, a Coast 
Guard spokesman said. A satellite is a good tool for tracking "because it is 
not affected by mountains, which is a problem in Alaska," the spokesman said. 
He added that the reliability of radar was limited by weather. Tanker traffic 
in Prince William Sound has been monitored by radar. But, when the Exxon Valdez 
ran aground last March 24, it was beyond the area normally scanned by radar, 
the Coast Guard said. The new system will be evaluated for a year in the sound 
and 22 other ports and waterways around the country. Vessel owners will be 
responsible for the cost of installing the "black boxes" that link up with the 
system, a Coast Guard spokesman said.

Firefighters have doused a brush fire that charred about 850 acres of dense 
chaparral near Norco over the holiday weekend, a state Forestry Department 
spokesman said. The wildfire, which broke out Saturday afternoon, was declared 
out at 6 p.m. Sunday, said Bob Ingram, a forestry official. Fire officials 
believe the blaze was probably caused by children playing with matches, said 
Jeff Lloyd, a dispatcher for the Forestry Department and the Riverside County 
Fire Department. About 225 firefighters from Orange and Riverside counties, the 
cities of Corona and Norco, the Forestry Department and the state Corrections 
Department battled the blaze at its height, Lloyd said. No one was injured. The 
investigation into the fire's cause was continuing.

Dense fog may have caused a 14-car chain-reaction crash that slightly injured 
two motorists on California 4 near Pittsburg, the California Highway Patrol 
reported. Blinding fog clinging above the roadways prompted National Weather 
Service warnings. Extremely dangerous driving conditions were posted for much 
of California's Central valley, from north of Marysville to Bakersfield. The 
fog was a factor in the chain-reaction crash just before 1 a.m. Monday morning 
on California 4 between Pittsburg and Concord, according to a CHP spokeswoman. 
San Jose International Airport was fogged in late Sunday for three hours, 
delaying some Christmas travelers. Visibility was reported near zero in some 
Central Valley areas, but skies were clear at the San Francisco and Oakland 
airports, and travelers did not experience weather-caused delays. Weather 
officials said a high-pressure system off the West Coast was preventing Pacific 
storms from reaching the state.

EAST BLOC, THIRD WORLD DEBTS SEEN RISING

<TEXT>
<P>
Debts of East European and Third World countries are due to rise next year 
despite the plan of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to ease some of the 
heaviest burdens on debtor countries. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a vibrant, growing economy -- like Indonesia, for example -- 
debt can be a good thing if it doesn't grow too fast," John M. Underwood of the 
World Bank said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sign that foreigners have confidence that it's a good place to put 
their money." 
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's debt rose from $43 billion in 1986 to $52 billion last year, 
according to figures that the bank issued this week. Indonesia had to pay 
nearly $8.5 billion in principal and interest to its creditors in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Third World leaders complain that such outflows leave them with little funds to 
build the schools and buy the equipment to create jobs for their growing 
populations. The bank calculated the outflow worldwide at more than $51 billion 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1983, new loans to developing countries brought them more money than they 
had to pay out on the old ones. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cost, Third World governments still seek more loans, if only to 
help pay the interest on the old loans. 
</P>
<P>
Underwood is top economist in the International Economics Department of the 
World Bank, the largest source of aid to Third World countries. The aid is also 
in the form of loans, over $21 billion in the year that ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The bank plans to provide as much as $1.35 billion to Poland, which got nothing 
last year but already owes more than $42 billion. Its new non-Communist 
leadership is hoping to borrow $4 billion or more in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
Brady's strategy seeks to ease the burden for 39 debtor countries, by combining 
debt and interest reduction with new loans from banks. So far, plans have been 
developed for three countries: Mexico, the Philippines and Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank estimated that his strategy could save as much as $6 billion a 
year for 19 "severely indebted middle-income countries" like Argentina and the 
Philippines, which owe much of their debt to private banks. Brady made his 
proposal last March, before the big changes in Eastern European countries, 
which now have better prospects for getting the new loans they want. 
</P>
<P>
For the poorest countries, governments are the main creditors rather than 
banks. During the 1980s, 10 creditor governments have forgiven $2.3 billion 
owed to them. The United States, which was not among the 10, has promised to 
forgive $1 billion. New aid to these countries, most of them in Africa, is now 
largely in the form of grants. 
</P>
<P>
Two officials of Resources for the Future, a private study group in Washington, 
said that the United States has an interest in easing the debt burden: The 
heaviest debtors are among the biggest buyers of U.S. goods. The less they have 
to pay out to banks, the more they have left over to buy the products of U.S. 
farms and industries, they pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"The net result of easing debt burdens would be more robust economies that 
would support more stable political systems and create stronger markets for 
U.S. exports," wrote Elaine M. Koerner and George E. Rossmiller in the fall 
issue of Resource for the Future, the organization's quarterly publication. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank predicted that the debt of 111 countries will rise to $1.189 
trillion in 1990 from $1.165 trillion this year. Underwood said that the 
Institute of International Finance, which collects figures for major private 
banks, adds another $188 billion for 10 countries, including the Soviet Union, 
that the bank does not count. The Central Intelligence Agency estimated that 
the Soviets owed $42.3 billion to Western banks last year.

That would bring the current total to $1.353 trillion. The figure could be 
raised in 1990 by new lending to help East European governments as they switch 
to something more like the market economies of the West.

VATICAN CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Treading lightly in a mine field of conflicting law and sentiment, the Vatican 
opened talks with the United States here Monday on the fate of ousted 
Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The meetings were unannounced, but Vatican sources said diplomats from the U.S. 
Embassy to the Holy See twice visited the Vatican to confer with prelates at 
the secretariat of state. 
</P>
<P>
One source delicately described the meetings as "transmissions of information," 
but another said that the United States was demanding that the Vatican turn 
over the ousted strongman to face drug-trafficking charges in Florida. The 
Vatican had taken no decision at day's end, the sources agreed. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of practice, questions of international resonance affecting the 
Vatican are decided personally by Pope John Paul II, who heard the news of 
Noriega's asylum request while preparing for midnight Mass Sunday. He made no 
mention of Panama in his Mass homily Sunday, or in his traditional Monday noon 
Christmas address at St. Peter's. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega sought refuge in the Vatican's embassy in Panama City on Sunday, five 
days after the United States invaded Panama to arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said Monday that Noriega had been accepted at 
the embassy after he expressed "the will to end the conflict." Refuge had been 
granted, he said, in the interests of ending bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
In a 20-minute meeting with reporters Monday, Navarro stressed that the Vatican 
had not acceded to Noriega's request for political asylum but that his legal 
status had not been decided. 
</P>
<P>
Asked after his news conference by an Italian television reporter if a quick, 
direct transfer of Noriega to the United States seemed possible, Navarro 
replied: 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I don't think so. There isn't any extradition treaty or anything," he 
said, stressing that no decision would be taken until after Vatican diplomats 
had conferred with "concerned parties." 
</P>
<P>
First among such parties, Navarro said, would be the new Panamanian government 
of President Guillermo Endara, who himself was sheltered for a month in the 
Vatican embassy last spring after winning an election that Noriega annulled. 
Unspoken but understood in Navarro's remarks is the key role of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, Vatican officials make no secret of their repugnance for Noriega. 
His dictatorship was the sort of rule that Pope John Paul II regularly inveighs 
against, one official noted. 
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian church has historically been one of the strongest opponents -- 
and a frequent target -- of the military dictatorships that have marked 
Panamanian national life for most of the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Vatican diplomats, however, noted that diplomatic asylum is an important 
international principle, particularly in Latin America, where it has 
traditionally proved an effective means of averting the sort of reprisals 
following political tumult that saw the execution Monday of deposed Romanian 
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro said the Vatican would weigh "humanitarian, juridical and political" 
considerations in making its decision. 
</P>
<P>
If it found that Noriega had no case for political asylum and was being justly 
pursued for criminal offenses, the Vatican could hand him over to the Endara 
government if it guaranteed his safety, one official said. 
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, if he was granted asylum, the Vatican could arrange a safe 
conduct for Noriega to a third country. Spain, Cuba and the Dominican Republic 
were all being considered in Panama on Monday, officials here noted. 
</P>
<P>
Vatican sources said the papal nuncio in Panama City had agreed to give Noriega 
refuge only after he had promised to abandon all resistance. Navarro would not 
comment on the circumstances surrounding Noriega's arrival at the embassy, but 
he rejected one reporter's suggestion that the Vatican had been "embarrassed" 
by his choice. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, said Navarro, the question was whether the Vatican, by accepting 
Noriega, "could contribute in some way to the pacification of the country, to 
end the violence." 
</P>
<P>
Vatican discomfit at Noriega's surprise visit was all behind closed doors. 
Officially, the mood was upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I can announce with satisfaction that the conflict in Panama seems to be 
nearing a solution without further shedding of blood. And this is good news for 
Christmas Day," Navarro said in a written statement promising quick contacts 
"between the concerned parties to examine the personal case of Gen. Noriega in 
all its aspects." 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Catholic theologians rallied behind the Vatican, saying 
they believe the church has a strong position and will be able to hammer out a 
deal to relocate Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the Vatican will support the government of Panama and other Latin 
American governments by trying to negotiate some type of exile for Noriega," 
said Los Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahony. "The Vatican will be looking at a 
solution with a humanitarian reference rather than a legal reference." 
</P>
<P>
William Ryan, a spokesman in Washington for the U.S. Catholic Conference, said 
the church had no choice but to afford Noriega protection in the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a tradition that goes back to the Middle Ages," he said. "The church is 
a place people would go to when they can go nowhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, Noriega's request for a safe haven was "thrust on the 
church. . . . If they refused (to take him), they would be on dangerous grounds 
as far as the international diplomatic community is concerned." If the church 
starts picking and choosing between whom it will take in, it could be attacked 
for sheltered individual refugees in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Legalistic issues aside, it also would be difficult for the church to reject 
Noriega because accepting him apparently could help end the bloodshed in the 
nation -- an important aim of the church. 
</P>
<P>
"The church always wants to put an end to fighting," said Thomas Reese, a 
Jesuit priest and research fellow at Georgetown University's Woodstock 
Theological Center in Washington. To the church, he said, "putting people in 
jail is a secondary consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Reese said he believes talks on Noriega's fate could take weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of different things are involved here," he said. "I think the Vatican 
will sit tight for awhile and try to find something that will keep everyone 
happy. That's going to be very difficult to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the Vatican doesn't want to keep him," he added. "They'd like to get 
rid of him as soon as possible. But they have to do it in a way that doesn't 
set a precedent" by surrendering him to hostile authorities.

Whine Country: Votes were cast from New Jersey to California, and the winners 
were announced Monday in the National Whiner's Day poll. Included were "Today" 
show host Bryant Gumbel for his memos knocking his colleagues; former First 
Lady Nancy Reagan for her autobiography; Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) for his 
political antics, and televangelist wife and makeup queen Tammy Bakker for her 
wails about her and her husband's alleged mistreatment. But outpolling them all 
by an 8-1 margin was actress Zsa Zsa Gabor for her hyped Beverly Hills traffic 
case. Gabor was named the "Most Recognizable Whiner of 1989."

No Noshing: Real life G-men (and women) are advised to pack a snack before a 
raid. Under a new General Accounting Office ruling, there will be no free 
coffee or doughnuts as the good guys stake out the bad guys. The ruling was 
issued after a January, 1986, task force of 3,150 FBI agents and New York City 
police and detectives met in a locked, drafty Brooklyn warehouse starting at 
3:30 a.m. for a super-secret raid on organized-crime suspects. To make life 
more comfy, the FBI asked the Salvation Army to supply coffee, doughnuts and 
portable toilets -- a service for which an FBI agent later turned in a $1,000 
bill. FBI accountants bucked the expense item to the GAO, which said two years 
later that the cash shouldn't have been paid for a non-emergency service.

YOUR BODY: WHEN IN DOUBT, IT'S SUGAR OVER FAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Standing in front of yet another heaped holiday buffet, you find yourself 
debating a lesser-of-two-evils question: Which is worse, fatty foods or sugary 
goodies? 
</P>
<P>
"If you have to indulge, go for the sugar," says Jody Lander Spector, a 
dietitian who directs a weight-control program at St. Vincent Medical Center. 
"Fat has double the amount of calories, gram for gram, as a carbohydrate like 
sugar." 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Tribole -- an Irvine dietitian and American Dietetic Assn. spokeswoman, 
is in agreement: "Peppermint candies, for instance, are pretty much fat-free." 
</P>
<P>
Some goodies, of course, have both fat and sugar, so the trick is to minimize 
the fat. "Choose fruit pies over cream or nut pies, which have more fat," says 
Spector. Adds Tribole: "When you eat pie, leave most of the crust. That's where 
much of the fat is." 
</P>
<P>
Above all, once you've picked your poison, enjoy it. "If you're going to 
indulge," Tribole says, "have something you really like that is not available 
other times of the year. And savor the moment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Year-End Evaluations Fill Personal Needs 
</P>
<P>
Year-end reviews aren't just mainstays of the media. 
</P>
<P>
Self-evaluation of the year's events and accomplishments is common for most 
people, therapists say. 
</P>
<P>
What's behind our need to rehash the past? 
</P>
<P>
"Part of rehashing is facing our own aging," says Marc Schoen, a psychologist 
at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. "Reviewing accomplishments helps us decide if 
we're moving fast enough through life, if we're accomplishing what we set out 
to do. It also represents our desire to learn from the past and to gain 
perspective." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Edward Stainbrook, USC professor emeritus of psychiatry and behavioral 
sciences, agrees: "It's a way to become more cognizant of who you are and where 
you're going. It's an effort to boil down the year's experience into something 
that makes sense." 
</P>
<P>
Year-end evaluations can help us formulate new goals and directions, Schoen 
says. To do that, individuals must move from evaluating to resolving, Schoen 
and Stainbrook agree. 
</P>
<P>
Rehashing too much can be counterproductive. "People who focus too much on the 
past can hold themselves back," Schoen says. "And focusing exclusively on 
failures rather than successes can be a way of punishing themselves." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Step Up in Class With New Exercise Program 
</P>
<P>
Bored with your same-old aerobics class? Try bench or step aerobics, a new 
twist in which exercisers work out to music while stepping up and down and back 
and forth on wooden or plastic benches. One foot is always on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Bench aerobics pack all the cardiovascular punch of conventional classes but 
little of the orthopedic impact, some experts claim. 
</P>
<P>
The fitter the exerciser, the higher the bench. Beginners try 4-inch heights, 
the more advanced up to about 12 inches, says Richard Walsh, aerobics director 
of Mezzeplex in West Los Angeles, where two to three bench aerobics classes are 
offered daily. 
</P>
<P>
Bench classes also will debut in early January at Voight Fitness &amp; Dance 
Center, West Hollywood, says co-owner Henry Siegel. Other health clubs are 
expected to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, it's wonderful exercise," says Kathie Davis of Idea, The Assn. for 
Fitness Professionals in San Diego, who recently evaluated bench aerobics. 
"It's low impact with creative moves. Exercisers can add variety by using arm 
weights." 
</P>
<P>
"It feels much easier on the body than conventional aerobics," adds Robin 
Siegelman, 30, of Los Angeles, who takes several bench classes a week. "It 
helps tone lower-body muscles more than conventional classes." 
</P>
<P>
Bench aerobics might also change the look of classes. Proponents hope its less 
choreographed form will attract more men than conventional aerobics, where 
women outnumber men 9-1.

DIFFERING VIEWS OF COSMIC DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DEMBART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cosmos and Metacosmos by Robert Wesson (Open Court: $26.95 hardcover, $11.95 
paper; 157 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Some people -- those of the scientific turn of mind -- look at the order and 
complexity of the world around us and say it's all an accident, a matter of 
chance. Other people -- those of the religious turn of mind -- look at the same 
facts and conclude that a Creator must be responsible for all this. 
</P>
<P>
Both of these views are matters of faith -- they can't be proved. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Wesson, a political scientist with a keen interest in matters 
philosophical, believes there is a third approach, which he calls "nontheistic 
nonmaterialism": "This lies midway between . . . the belief that the world is 
the work of a great personality who watches over it and perhaps intervenes on 
occasion to set things right, and the theory that material particles are the 
totality of existence." 
</P>
<P>
In Wesson's view, there is a metacosmos, a ground of being, if you will, that 
underlies the material world and makes it possible. "The material world is not 
the totality of existence but a derivative of something primordial," he says. 
It's not God, but purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Now, regular readers of this space have perhaps noticed that on this most basic 
of all issues, I side with the reductionists. It is as clear to me as the nose 
on your face that biology is a branch of chemistry, that chemistry is a branch 
of physics and that the impersonal, uncaring, undirected laws of science can 
ultimately explain the universe and everything in it. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, although I disagree with its premise, Wesson's book was a delight 
to read. In 139 well-written, well-argued pages, he displays mastery of and 
deep thought about a stunning range of subjects -- physics, biology, 
civilization, progress, mind and ethics among them. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, he claims the reductionist model doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"Reductionism, however attractive as theoretical simplification, is to a large 
extent only theoretical and programmatic, giving an illusion of deeper 
understanding than we have," Wesson writes. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he challenges Darwinian evolution as a plausible account of how 
living creatures evolved from single-celled organisms to us. Not that he thinks 
Darwin is wrong, mind you. Rather, he asserts, Darwin is incomplete. There must 
be something else at work in addition to natural selection to account for the 
development of organs and other complex structures, including instincts. 
</P>
<P>
Evolution can explain small changes, but not large ones, Wesson asserts. "If 
mutations are like typos, it is easier to imagine them producing new words than 
new chapters. Natural selection is certainly a proofreader of the book of life, 
perhaps an editor; to give it credit for full authorship is too much." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, he says, "It is reasonable to guess that the patterns of life, while 
conforming to physical and chemical laws, go beyond them in the realization of 
the order-making capabilities behind and in the universe, incorporating what we 
can fairly call a higher, or more creative level of being." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, he finds no explanation of why evolution alone created minds that 
like to play chess or that like to think about consciousness or philosophy. 
Where is the survival value in reading book reviews? Or is that just an extra 
that got thrown in along the way? 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is that it's difficult to distinguish what Wesson calls "purpose" 
from what theologians call "God." Wesson says they are not the same -- 
"nontheistic nonmaterialism" -- but it's not clear what's different other than 
a different name. 
</P>
<P>
Wesson's "third way" is no more provable or unprovable than theism or atheism 
or any other world view. Those who are convinced will say it makes sense; those 
who are unconvinced will stay unconvinced. But it makes you wonder.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: HE'S NOT YET READY TO DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I promised to teach my 16-year-old son to drive and to let 
him get a learner's permit, but in many ways, I think he's too immature to be 
behind the wheel of a car. I hate to go back on my promise, but when I see him 
take so many needless risks in sports and even on our riding lawn mower, I'm 
concerned. His sister was much more mature at his age and she's an excellent 
driver. Because she got her permit at 16, he feels that he should too. -- M.O. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR M.O.: You're the one in charge, and driving a car is a responsibility, not 
a privilege that comes automatically at a certain age. Don't be afraid to 
explain that your son hasn't exhibited the mature behavior you feel is 
necessary for someone placed in charge of an auto. You may be surprised how 
rapidly his behavior improves. 
</P>
<P>
One way to determine whether or not a youngster is ready to get behind the 
wheel of a car is to watch how he handles stressful situations. If he has 
outbursts of temper whenever he's frustrated or doesn't get what he wants, then 
it might be wise to wait another six months or a year until he gets more 
control. 
</P>
<P>
As Dr. John Schowalter, the president of the American Academy of Child and 
Adolescent Psychiatry, points out, anger is the leading cause of accidents 
second only to drugs and alcohol. Discuss this with your son. Unfortunately, 
automobiles can provide a quick but dangerous remedy to feelings of 
powerlessness. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I hate it when my mother and her friends tell me to smile. 
The only thing that happens when they say this is that I get angry and want to 
throw something at them. I hate adult hypocrisy. Sometimes I think all adults 
ever do is lie to each other about their feelings. -- D.R. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR D.R.: Maybe what you're seeing as hypocrisy is good manners. Few people 
admire hypocrites but "letting it all hang out" can be damaging. If there is a 
lot of anger and resentment, it can actually make things worse. Anger that is 
expressed tends to escalate, rather than diminish, until people end up saying 
things they wish they hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies indicate that putting on a sad face or a smile directly produces 
the feeling that the expressions represent. Facial signs may contribute to the 
feeling itself. Facial expressions affect the temperature of blood flowing to 
the brain, providing a possible, though not undisputed, mechanism for 
regulating emotions. 
</P>
<P>
You might try smiling or even just saying "cheese" if you can't bring yourself 
to actually smile. This might put you in a more relaxed, happier mood -- it 
might even make you laugh.

MOODS OF DIABETICS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: A friend of mine has diabetes, and he's been having a problem in 
getting his insulin adjusted. He's usually a very pleasant person, but lately 
his personality seems to have changed. I don't know if it's because he's 
worried about the insulin, or whether insulin itself has such an effect. Can 
insulin cause depression? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Insulin-dependent persons sometimes do experience feelings of 
depression, but, although insulin is involved, it's actually changes in the 
blood-sugar level that are responsible. Although it may take a little time, 
these feelings should disappear when the dose of insulin and the timing of its 
administration are adjusted to keep the patient's blood-sugar level on a 
steadier keel. 
</P>
<P>
It is not uncommon for insulin-related mood disorders to occur at night. Too 
much insulin or failure to have a snack before going to bed may cause 
blood-sugar levels to fall too low, a condition known as hypoglycemia. As a 
result, the patient's sleep may be disturbed, or he or she may not be able to 
sleep at all. On the other hand, too much insulin may cause the patient to feel 
hungry and spur eating. 
</P>
<P>
These varied reactions can lead to feelings of anxiety, an inability to 
concentrate and irritability. This can all add up to depression.

CRITIC AT LARGE: OPENING BOXES THE DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today, as my foreign-born desk calendar reminds me, is Boxing Day in the 
British Isles. The originating idea was that this was the day the haves 
distributed boxes of food and other useful items to their servants and other 
have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
It has always seemed to me that only in a society as vigorously stratified as 
Britain's has been (and to some extent still is) would the idea of a kind of a 
Christmas II just for the servants be found appropriate. It was a terribly 
decent thought, but you don't wonder that it hasn't taken root elsewhere. 
Servants, in national quantities, are hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
By a nice historical twist, Boxing Day has now become a latter-time pleasure of 
British life. Having, I presume, lost all or almost all of its founding 
intention, it survives as a wonderful way of making the actual observance of 
Christmas last two days instead of only one. 
</P>
<P>
There is none of that awful dragging back to the office with several hundred 
calories' worth of fruitcake sitting in the bottom of your stomach like so many 
bright silver dollars, as Bob and Ray used to say. There is an extra day to let 
your metabolism simmer down. The clerks in department stores have an extra day 
to compose themselves before the flood tide of fuzzy slippers and misjudged 
haberdashery arrives to be exchanged for what had been hoped for in the first 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
Television in Britian is alive with special attractions on the 26th, the kind 
you can watch without strain, through heavy-lidded eyes. As late as the 
mid-'60s, John Huston's shaggy comedy, "Beat the Devil," was a perennial BBC 
offering on Christmas or Boxing Day, a present to be cherished by either the 
haves or the have-nots. Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life," which has become 
an international carrier of the Christmas spirit, was also available. 
</P>
<P>
Holidays and birthdays acquire a sharp second edge when you find yourself in 
foreign surroundings. In 1944 I spent Christmas Eve, and indeed Christmas and 
Boxing Day, in a tent city outside Southampton, waiting to board an LST for Le 
Havre. It was bitterly cold, cold enough to feel like Christmas in Upstate New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
And there was something comforting about being able to catch sights and sounds 
of Christmas observance amid the wartime gray of that English city. Christmas 
is a universal day, more secular every year, but the universality meant a lot 
amid the dank and penetrating chill and the anxieties of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Years later I spent three Thanksgivings and three Fourth of Julys in London, 
and discovered that there is nothing like a national holiday spent abroad to 
remind you that you are a long way from home and on alien soil even if it's 
friendly. There was no trouble getting turkeys, but as I remember the cranberry 
sauce was a problem. 
</P>
<P>
The great holidays are the punctuations of our years; memories crowd in, but 
the view is forward as well, and it is impossible not to hear a meter ticking 
in the mind's ear, time tiptoeing along a bit faster than you'd thought it was. 
</P>
<P>
This holiday season has been uncommonly contrasty, the world's good news 
unusually good, the horrors of Panama -- a society disintegrating in anarchy -- 
suddenly horrific and ominous. You grieve for brave young lives lost, and for 
innocent bystanders becoming part of the toll. 
</P>
<P>
But you have to believe, not least on so buoyant an occasion as the Christmas 
season, that perspective -- a sense of the long past and the long future -- is 
required. Nothing is ever really simple, and not much is forever, not even the 
divisions of the world. Boxing Day revealed the generous instincts of a society 
that was also divided, often cruelly, along class lines; and now that holiday 
is a sort of anachronistic gift, an extra day off, for the society at large. 
</P>
<P>
A special case can be made, in fact, that Boxing Day wouldn't be a bad addition 
to the American calendar, even now. Another day off, to be sure, but a holiday 
committed to the ancient originating idea of attention, not to the servants but 
to the have-nots, the disenfranchised -- and a summoning of resources for the 
homeless.

TEXACO CELEBRATES 50 YEARS OF MET BROADCASTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SILVERMAN, ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was New Year's Day 1949, and soprano Lily Pons was nearing the end of the 
mad scene from "Lucia di Lammermoor" on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera 
House. 
</P>
<P>
Reaching for one of the fiendishly difficult high F's that were her trademark 
in the role, the diminutive French diva fell short, emitting what a New York 
Times reviewer later called "a blemished final tone." 
</P>
<P>
But radio listeners who heard a tape-delayed broadcast of the Donizetti opera 
the next day never detected a false note. In its place, engineers had spliced 
in another high F from the same aria -- one that Miss Pons had hit squarely on 
the mark. 
</P>
<P>
The disparity between the reviews and the radio caused an uproar in the music 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco, sponsor of the Saturday matinee broadcasts, had known that many 
stations would delay "Lucia" because it conflicted with the Rose Bowl football 
game. But the incident helped bring such tape-delays into disrepute, and 
eventually a special network was set up just for the opera series. One 
requirement for membership: Stations had to agree to carry all performances 
live. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturdays, more than 300 stations in the United States and Canada -- 
including KUSC (91.5 FM) -- are doing just that, as Texaco sponsors its 50th 
season of Met broadcasts -- the longest continuous national sponsorship of a 
program in radio history. 
</P>
<P>
KUSC has replaced the now defunct KFAC-FM as the Los Angeles home of the 
prestigious Met broadcasts. Wally Smith, president of KUSC, said the Met season 
was the programming plum at KFAC. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something that we have coveted for many, many years here at KUSC," Smith 
said. "It was about the only program we were interested in acquiring from KFAC. 
. . . The broadcasts really fit into the KUSC mission to preserve culture and 
present the best in performance." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the season, Texaco will have aired 990 performances of 124 
different operas, without commercial interruption. The company now spends $3.5 
million a year on the broadcasts, which the Met estimates are heard by 2 
million to 6 million people. 
</P>
<P>
For Texaco, the close identification with one of the nation's most cherished 
cultural institutions has proved a public relations dream worth every dollar. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing new about the principle on which we acted in merging oil and 
opera," company president W.S.S. Rodgers said at the time of its initial 
broadcast -- Mozart's "Le Nozze di Figaro" on Dec. 7, 1940. "American business 
has long acted on the policy of success through service to the greatest 
number." 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Texaco radio audiences have thrilled to virtually all of the 
world's leading opera singers in their prime -- from Kirsten Flagstad and 
Lauritz Melchior to Birgit Nilsson and Jon Vickers, from Licia Albanese and 
Eleanor Steber to Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland, from Richard Tucker and 
Jussi Bjoerling to Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo. 
</P>
<P>
They have occasionally heard history in the making, as when the great comic 
basso Salvatore Baccoloni made his debut on the very first broadcast. Or on the 
broadcast of Feb. 9, 1974, when a New Zealand soprano named Kiri Te Kanawa made 
an unscheduled debut as a last-minute substitute for Teresa Stratas in Verdi's 
"Otello." 
</P>
<P>
And they have been witness to tragedy, as on the broadcast of Jan. 23, 1988, 
when an 82-year-old vocal coach jumped to his death from a balcony during 
intermission after Act II of Verdi's "Macbeth." 
</P>
<P>
The announcer who conveyed that grim news to the radio audience was Peter 
Allen, who is launching his 15th season in the broadcast booth behind the Grand 
Tier. That stint might normally qualify him as an institution, were it not for 
the astonishing record of his predecessor, the legendary Milton Cross, who 
presided over the broadcasts from their pre-Texaco days in the 1930s until his 
death in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"I had auditioned because they thought Mr. Cross might want to retire," said 
Allen, who at the time was a staff announcer for classical radio station WQXR. 
"I used to be a subscriber to the opera myself. To take over his job was more 
than anything I had dreamed of." 
</P>
<P>
Allen said he prepares for each week's broadcast by doing research on the 
operas and composers, attending dress rehearsals and even prowling around the 
stage to inspect the scenery. 
</P>
<P>
"I wander all over the place looking for details, so I can try to give the 
listeners a picture of what they're missing," Allen said. "Sometime I even 
notice things that most people in the auditorium don't. Like the cafe scene of 
'La Boheme,' where Franco Zeffirelli has used real street posters from 
19th-Century Paris, advertisements for laxatives and lingerie." 
</P>
<P>
Allen also tries to anticipate things the radio audience might hear that 
wouldn't make sense to them without some explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them that Florestan's chains will rattle in the prison scene in 
'Fidelio' and that the audience will laugh when the inventor's workshop comes 
to life in 'Tales of Hoffmann,"' he said. 
</P>
<P>
Regular broadcasts continue through April 21 (see accompanying schedule). At 
intermission each week, Edward Downes will again preside over the Texaco Opera 
Quiz as he has for 32 years. Other intermission features will include analyses 
of the day's opera, presented by such favorites as impresario Boris Goldovsky, 
who is celebrating his 45th season on the broadcasts.

Just for the record: In a recent column when I alluded to Nuremberg as an 
example of a place where people were oppressed and abused, I didn't -- God 
forbid! -- mean the defendants there. I was referring to the Nuremberg that was 
the cradle of Nazism, the site of the obscene Nuremberg laws and the place for 
Hitler's horror rallies and the place where his terrorist Brownshirts first 
practiced the art of kicking, killing and torturing their fellow human beings, 
so infamous it's the reason the war crime trials were put there in the first 
place. Nuremberg was a symbol for terror long before it became a symbol for 
retribution.

DANCE FEVER: The American Ballet Theatre's cancellation of a summer date at the 
Los Angeles Music Center doesn't mean that ballet companies should worry that 
they'll be locked out of L.A. if they also plan to stop in Orange County, 
officials say. . . . A Music Center official suggested that ABT reneged on its 
Los Angeles dates partly because of "direct competition" with its own 1990 
engagement at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, but Arts Center 
President Thomas R. Kendrick disagreed. . . . "It's been well documented that 
there are discrete audiences for the two centers." Dana Parsons and Mark I.

Aid poured into Romania by road and rail Monday from relief organizations 
around the world, but an airlift was delayed amid conflicting reports on 
whether Bucharest airport is open. 
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting around the airport forced flights to be diverted to other 
places, such as Varna in neighboring Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Defense Ministry spokesman Gyorgy Keleti said the Hungarian army had 
delivered 81 tons of food to neighboring Romania, where thousands of people 
have been killed and wounded in a revolution that toppled President Nicolae 
Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
He said Finnish, Belgian and Danish military planes had landed at Budapest 
airport with medical supplies that would be carried in by road.

CELEBRITIES FIND LUXURY OF INATTENTION IN LAGUNA

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Under tight security, a salmon-colored, palatial mansion hugs the bluffs 
overlooking Aliso Beach, dwarfing other multimillion-dollar homes around it. 
</P>
<P>
So grand is the towering, Mediterranean-style villa under construction near the 
ocean's edge that it was rumored that the Guccis were coming to town. But the 
Italian family whose name is synonymous with chic handbags and luggage isn't 
moving to Laguna Beach. Rather, a non-Gucci who reportedly supplies watches to 
the company will occupy the conspicuous Camel Point estate. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, others who own homes in the beach community, including sports 
commentator O.J. Simpson, actress Bette Midler and former TV star Harriet 
Nelson, shun showy displays of wealth, preferring to blend into the fabric of 
the artistic village known for liberal attitudes and colorful characters. 
</P>
<P>
In this well-known retreat that boasts a proximity to Los Angeles without the 
jet set atmosphere of Malibu, celebrities mingle freely among other 
townspeople, rarely attracting crowds or creating public spectacles. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never go shopping myself in L.A. and would certainly never go in New 
York because it can get a little hairy," says Simpson, who spends summers with 
his wife and four children at their Laguna Beach home. "But in Laguna, I often 
get the list and go do the shopping myself and nobody bothers me. I become a 
Lagunatic. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen Gucci loafers on the beach in Malibu, but you can let your hair down 
in Laguna. The people are a lot more down to earth." 
</P>
<P>
Simpson and Nelson can be seen strolling the aisles at the neighborhood grocery 
store. Robert Englund, better known as fiendish Freddie Kreuger of "A Nightmare 
on Elm Street," turned up recently at a march to protest development in Laguna 
Canyon. And like other, less famous mothers, Midler signed her young daughter 
up for swimming lessons last summer at the city's Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
"Laguna's got its own identity, with a mix of all different kinds of people," 
Laguna Beach Police Sgt. Ray Lardie explains. "You have the upper class, the 
Hare Krishnas, the gays, the homeless. . . . Anaheim and Placentia are great 
cities, but they don't have the draw of Laguna." 
</P>
<P>
And, says Lardie, celebrities in Laguna have not had to worry about overzealous 
fans whose obsessions sometimes lead to violence. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had any problems," Lardie said. "They don't require any more 
special treatment than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Yet even Laguna residents who pride themselves on a certain level of 
sophistication have been known to lose their cool when celebrity residents step 
out in public. 
</P>
<P>
When Midler reportedly joined a local health club several months ago, a parade 
of cars inched past the picture window for weeks, straining for a glimpse of 
the star, says Laguna Health Club co-owner Raymond Unger. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to make us furious," Unger said. "The phones were ringing off the 
hook. They'd call up (and ask), 'Is Bette there?' " 
</P>
<P>
Co-owner Jack Fontan said he thought it was some kind of a joke when he first 
got a telephone call from a man, claiming to be Midler's trainer, asking if a 
celebrity could work out at the club "without being bothered." 
</P>
<P>
"I figured he was some kind of a jerk and I said, "How am I to assure you that 
your celebrity won't be bothered at my gym?' " 
</P>
<P>
When Midler arrived, bundled in a thick sweat suit, no one knew who she was, 
Unger said. 
</P>
<P>
"The boy at the desk thought she was some housewife. When she signed her name, 
he said it was funny that she had the same name as Bette Midler," Unger said. 
"Then when she took off her sweat suit he said, 'Oh my God, it's Bette Midler' 
when he saw her hair." 
</P>
<P>
Long after Midler had stopped working out at the club, it continued to get 
phone callers asking if she was there, Unger said. 
</P>
<P>
One city employee admits it's hard to keep her cool when she runs into Simpson 
pushing a shopping cart at her local grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen him a lot and I just kind of follow him around," she said, asking 
that her name not be published. "He's so cute. But nobody bothers him. What am 
I going to do? Jump in his lap? That would be awfully embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
A Simpson appearance at a Board of Adjustment meeting last year was enough to 
make City Councilman Neil Fitzpatrick take notice. 
</P>
<P>
"He was up there testifying like any good citizen would do," Fitzpatrick said. 
"Everybody did what I did. Their eyes got real big, they watched, kept their 
mouths shut and tried to be real cool. He didn't run up over there and leap 
over three rows of chairs or anything." 
</P>
<P>
Other Laguna residents go out of their way not to accord celebrities special 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"We all like to think we're as cool as they are, so we don't want to make too 
big a deal out of it," said Colleen McKown, a swimming instructor. 
</P>
<P>
That became evident recently when Midler enrolled her young daughter in 
McKown's swimming class. 
</P>
<P>
"I had known she was coming and I had waited and waited," McKown said. "They 
were late on the first day. When she got here, I said, 'Is your daughter signed 
up for this class?' She said yes and I told her, 'Now it's very important for 
you to get here on time.' She said she was sorry. Then I asked her if she had a 
receipt, so she dug in her purse to look for it and she kept digging until I 
told her she didn't have to look for it anymore," McKown said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fun talking about it to all of my friends, but when she was here, it 
really wasn't that big a deal," McKown said.

DEADLINE NEARS FOR VICTORIA ST. FAMILIES

<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in 23 years, the yellow and white home of Billie Jo and Bob 
Hamilton on Victoria Street shows no evidence of the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
In about a month, the couple and their 25-year-old son will pack up and move to 
a new address, under city orders. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes no sense to put up all those decorations and have to turn around and 
take then right back down and put them in boxes," Billie Jo Hamilton said. 
"We'll just celebrate Christmas at my daughter's house. She has a tree and all 
the trimmings." 
</P>
<P>
The Hamiltons are among 68 Victoria Street households forced from their homes 
so that the city can widen the heavily traveled thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
The $25-million project, approved by the city in 1987, will widen a 1.3-mile 
stretch of Victoria from two lanes to four, between Harbor Boulevard and Canyon 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
City planners say they hope the project will be completed by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The project will include the demolition of about 30 condominiums and apartments 
along the strip, but will leave in place the one church and three schools on 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
Residents were notified of the city's plans last January, and soon afterward 
Costa Mesa officials hired appraisers to determine a fair market value of the 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
"The city certainly offered the residents top value for their homes," said 
Robert Brock, assistant city engineer. "We worked carefully with each resident 
to assure limited complications." 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County's escalating housing costs created problems, Brock said. 
</P>
<P>
"There were incidents where doing our negotiations to buy the property, we 
would have to up the price a few times during a matter of weeks," he said. "We 
picked a time when property value in the area was at an all-time high." 
</P>
<P>
Victoria Street residents also are eligible for $15,000 in relocation fees, 
Brock said. Despite a profit on their home, Billie Jo Hamilton says she and her 
husband don't like the idea of leaving 23 years of memories behind. 
</P>
<P>
"If this hadn't have happened, I am sure we'd have lived here for the rest of 
our lives," said Hamilton, who raised three children in the house. "We hate to 
do it, but what can you do if the city says move?" Hamilton said the heavy 
traffic rarely bothered her, though city officials say that the 15,000 to 
20,000 cars that now travel Victoria Street daily are far too much for a 
two-lane road, and that the traffic will probably double in the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Hamiltons, Leon Sofro's family looks on the move as a welcome 
change. the Sofros have lived on Victoria Street for 5 years. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffic was getting progressively worse," Leon Sofro said. "It was at the 
point that my kids couldn't even play in the yard because we were afraid that 
any day a drunk driver or something would run into our yard." The new four-lane 
corridor will include medians, 6-foot-high sound walls and frontage roads, as 
well as sidewalks and bike paths. 
</P>
<P>
Though most of the other Victoria Street residents are gone, neither the 
Hamiltons nor the Sofros have found new homes. Their deadline to move is Feb. 1 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to wait until the last minute and enjoy our home as much as we 
could," Hamilton said. "We got our 90-day notice the other day, and I guess 
that finally finalized it in our heads." ALLISON SAMUELS

COUNCIL POSTPONES CLUB PERMIT ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER MOULTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neighbors of the Purple Heart Saloon have complained about the music from the 
pop and country-Western bands that drifts their way until 1:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
And the manager of the Purple Heart doesn't appreciate being nearly put out of 
business by city officials responding to those complaints. 
</P>
<P>
But such is the stand-off between Ken Harmon, who runs the saloon on South Brea 
Boulevard, and some of his neighbors. The winner will be decided by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the council postponed until February a decision about whether to 
renew Harmon's permit for live entertainment. Meanwhile, however, Harmon is 
without a permit -- and without any entertainment on Friday and Saturday 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
The situation has very nearly "put me out of business," Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
Dan and Linda Kelley, who have lived almost directly behind the Purple Heart 
Saloon since January, complained to the council on Oct. 3 about music from live 
bands keeping them awake until 1:30 a.m. The couple also complained of fights 
in the alley between their house and the bar, and of people urinating on their 
wooden fence. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Ken needs live entertainment to survive like he says, and if he 
does, he's doing something wrong," Dan Kelley said at last Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Kelleys made their complaint and the city discovered that an 
extension on the entertainment permit is needed, no bands or groups have 
performed at the Purple Heart Saloon. 
</P>
<P>
"For six weeks, they haven't had any live entertainment, and it's been very 
peaceful," Linda Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff, based on its investigation, had advised the council to deny the 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
"In recommending a denial, the city staff analyzed the difficulties which had 
occurred with the loud music and noise," said Donna M. Rhine, city clerk. "The 
investigation showed that all kinds of problems were occurring, and most of 
them were related to the entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron Isles agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Live entertainment attracts a certain type of clientele and behavior," Isles 
said. "When you have a band, people go there to dance and get rowdy." 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, who has managed the saloon for four years, said he has made repeated 
efforts to accommodate the Kelleys. 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't care, I wouldn't give them my home phone number and invite them to 
come to me and let me know when they have a problem," Harmon said. "The city 
has no idea how clean this business is being run. They're listening to one 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
The Brea Police Department helped the city staff investigate the complaints of 
other neighbors in the area. Of the five residents affected by noise from the 
area around the saloon, two complained of loud music. All reported hearing 
fights, screams and the sounds of broken bottles in the alley, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Harmon, Ken's wife, said the city is to blame for the problems behind the 
saloon. 
</P>
<P>
"The alley is dimly lit and the kids like to hang out back there," she said. 
"That's the city's fault. If the city wants to light that alley, we're all for 
it. Lights would make all the difference." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not my job to patrol that area," Ken Harmon said. "If they'd park a 
police car back there, I'd love it. There's nothing that goes on in this bar 
that I wouldn't want them to see." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Busleta, 42, who lives next to the Kelleys, agreed with Harmon. 
</P>
<P>
"The people out in back of the bar can get pretty loud, but there's nothing 
(the Harmons) can do about that," said Busleta, who said he enjoys going to the 
Purple Heart. "People throw bottles, yell, make a lot of noise. But you don't 
hear any music from the bar. The music's not the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"If he doesn't have an entertainment permit, the same things are going to 
happen," Busleta said. JENNIFER MOULTON

<P>
MENTALLY ILL FIND SOLACE IN PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA MASCARO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talking confidently and comfortably about his life, 38-year-old Pat reveals 
little of the pain and desolation he suffered after his condition was diagnosed 
as paranoid schizophrenia. 
</P>
<P>
But the stories he tells -- of nervous breakdowns, hospitalizations, daily 
doses of stabilizing prescription drugs, suicidal tendencies -- paint a clearer 
picture of the life style of the mentally or emotionally ill. 
</P>
<P>
And although he now lives at home and holds a part-time job as a janitor, he 
says returning to the social circuit is no easy feat. To smooth the transition, 
he has found solace in the Orange County Mental Health Assn.'s Project Return, 
a program providing a social outlet for mentally ill people as they re-enter 
mainstream society. 
</P>
<P>
"I just came here looking for something to get involved in," said Pat, who has 
belonged to the program for seven years. "I wanted to make some friends. I 
didn't have any." 
</P>
<P>
Project Return is composed of 13 individual clubs throughout the county where 
those who are re-entering society can meet other like souls for fellowship and 
social activity, said Lina Nabahani, who coordinates the program. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the more than 200 participants have been found to be either 
schizophrenic or manic depressive. Some live in board-and-care homes, while 
others have recently returned to private homes or families. 
</P>
<P>
Although each club has a volunteer facilitator, Nabahani says the clubs are 
self-help groups and members have the complete jurisdiction over how their club 
works. 
</P>
<P>
Weekly club meetings are primarily social get-togethers, but members also plan 
fund-raisers and social outings such as bowling parties and trips to the San 
Diego Zoo and Catalina Island. And some groups meet specifically for activities 
such as painting or sculpting sessions. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Cossaboom first came to club meetings seven years ago, hoping to find a 
place to socialize but not expecting much else. He ended up meeting a woman he 
would marry, although they have since separated. 
</P>
<P>
He continues to attend meetings and was recently elected president of the group 
of club presidents that meets monthly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a safe place to be yourself, to learn about other people and about 
yourself," said Cossaboom. 
</P>
<P>
Cossaboom, 31, prefers therapy and support groups to work. Employers, he says, 
don't understand the needs of the mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was working I'd get this stuff from my boss (about the club), 'You 
don't need them,' or about the therapy he'd say, 'You don't need that.' So in 
the end I said, 'I don't need you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mental health workers from various county agencies speak highly of the 
self-help aspect of the 7-year-old Project Return program, which they say 
offers a helpful bridge for patients who want to become socially active again. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows their problems like somebody who's been through the (same) 
problems," said Don Granger, mental health services coordinator for the 
Therapeutic Residential Center in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
At 54, Rosemary Duncan, who is schizophrenic, agrees. As a club member and 
federation officer, she enjoys offering younger club members her advice. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen what the world really looks like; I've gone through dramatic things 
. . . I can interact with these people and give them some interesting 
information," she said.LISA MASCARO

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO AGAIN IS HOTTEST CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, Orange County on Monday claimed the highest temperature in the 
continental United States. 
</P>
<P>
And once again, that temperature was recorded at San Juan Capistrano -- 84 
degrees. The city claimed the same honor, with a temperature of 82, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's warm, dry weather topped off a beautiful Southern California Christmas 
weekend, with temperatures that broke records throughout the area, while most 
other parts of the country suffered with extreme cold. Example: Milo, Me., 
which recorded 22 below Monday, the lowest temperature any place in the 
contiguous 48 states.

BALBOA FIRE KILLS WOMAN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 57-year-old woman was found dead in her bed early Monday after a fire swept 
through the maid's quarters of a Balboa Island home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, Law Kwui Ching, was a housekeeper who occupied separate living 
quarters in a home at 608 S. Bay Front, Newport Beach fire officials said. The 
owners of the house live in Los Angeles and were not at the home when the fire 
occurred, about 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the blaze appeared to have started accidently, caused by 
either cooking utensils or candles. Damage to the home was estimated at 
$140,000, mostly from smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Daniel Stringer, who lives across the street from the residence, said he 
was awakened by the screams of a neighbor who saw the flames. Stinger said 
Ching had come from Hong Kong about 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although a cause of death has not been determined, authorities said it is 
likely she died of smoke inhalation.

GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: LA QUINTA'S JALEWALIA MAKES POINTS WITH IMPROVED 
SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the surprise of just about no one, Amy Jalewalia was named the most valuable 
player of La Quinta's basketball tournament last week. 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia, The Times' Athlete of the Week, led La Quinta to the championship by 
scoring 44, 51 and 30 points on consecutive nights. 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia, a 6-foot-1 center, is averaging 30.5 points and 10 rebounds a game 
this season, but her success has more to do with her preparation than her 
proportion. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta Coach Kevin Kiernan said, "She didn't have that good a shot her first 
couple of years. It was something we consciously worked on." 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia's biggest improvement has been her shooting, Kiernan said. She went 
from averaging 13 points a game as a sophomore to leading the state with a 31.2 
average as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
Her improved shot also complements her main assets -- quickness and 
anticipation. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think her shooting would develop as fast as it did, but her defense 
gets her a lot of points too," Kiernan said. "Her anticipation on defense is 
the best I've seen -- she gets 10 to 15 points on steals alone. When you 
average 30 points, you get a lot of cheap baskets off the press." 
</P>
<P>
But Kiernan said she needs to improve her defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I can always improve everything: my ballhandling, being more consistent in my 
shooting," Jalewalia said. "But defense is the main thing. I guess on defense 
I've been known to 'float' a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Kiernan said, "We like to play man-on-man defense and, sometimes, she used to 
seem a little (uninterested), so I'd yell at her. Actually, her team defense is 
better than her man (defense). In the press, she gets so many points because 
she so quick and she steals the ball. I like to give Amy freedom because she's 
so quick." 
</P>
<P>
Jalewalia will move to guard when she plays at UCLA next season because of her 
size and quickness. Jalewalia prefers guard, but has to play center at La 
Quinta because she's the team's tallest player. 
</P>
<P>
"In practice she makes unbelievable passes," Kiernan said. "She'll be a great 
guard. With a team around her that has better scoring, she wouldn't have to 
score to be effective. She likes the attention of scoring, but she'd be happy 
just passing." 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Guards Tammy Blackburn and Aimee McDaniel led Brea-Olinda (13-0) to the Santa 
Barbara basketball tournament championship. In Tuesday's 82-59 victory over 
Fremont, McDaniel had 36 points with seven three-point field goals and 
Blackburn had 23 points. Both were named to the all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
In four games, Blackburn led Brea-Olinda in scoring twice (16 in a 56-36 
victory over Healdsburg Wednesday and 14 in a 59-48 upset of Morningside 
Thursday) and McDaniel led twice (36 Tuesday and 18 in a 65-61 championship 
victory over Los Angeles Washington Friday. 
</P>
<P>
At the Cypress basketball tournament, Mission Viejo's Jennifer Rohrig had 31 
points, 25 rebounds and six blocked shots to lead the Diablos to a 57-50 
victory over Cerritos Thursday and had 18 points in a 48-33 victory over 
Foothill Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Melisa Sortino had 32 points, including seven three pointers, to lead Marina to 
a 91-53 victory over Los Alamitos at the Cypress tournament Tuesday. Sortino 
scored 30 points Wednesday in a 67-52 victory over Cerritos in the tournament. 
</P>

EDISON SECOND IN BASKETBALL POLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mater Dei High School remains the top-ranked team in the Orange County 
Sportswriters' Assn. prep basketball poll while Edison jumps from fourth last 
week to second following a victory over Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (8-1) was idle last week and opens play this week in the Orange 
Holiday Tournament at Chapman College as the top-seeded team. 
</P>

BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: WESTERN'S SABBARA GETS HIS KICKS PLAYING BASKETBALL

<P>
Sam Sabbara did not polish his athletic ability on the basketball courts of 
Western High School, rather he honed his skills on the soccer fields in Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
"(In Jordan) basketball is nonexistent and everyone plays soccer," said 
Sabbara, a 6-foot-1 point guard at Western. 
</P>
<P>
Sabbara first played organized basketball in seventh grade, five years after 
his family moved from Jordan to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a pretty good soccer player," he said, "but basketball intrigued me 
more." 
</P>
<P>
But if Sabbara started playing basketball late, he has more than made up for it 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
Take last week, for example. Sabbara, the Times' Athlete of the Week, scored 75 
points in three games in the Fullerton tournament. 
</P>
<P>
He scored 23 points and had nine assists and nine rebounds Friday to lead the 
Pioneers to an 83-60 victory over Fullerton in the third-place game. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time that Western (6-2) finished third in a tournament this 
season, each time losing in the semifinals to the eventual champions. 
</P>
<P>
Sabbara has played a key role in Western's success. He is averaging 27 points 
and eight assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
Western Coach Greg Hoffman said those totals would be higher if Sabbara was 
playing more. He averages only 21 minutes a game because he is taken out in the 
fourth quarter of Western routs. 
</P>
<P>
Sabbara is shooting 54% from the field, 54% from three-point range and 94% from 
the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not blessed with the great height or the great body size," he said. "I'm 
just an average guy. You need to work hard to become better." 
</P>
<P>
In the off-season, Sabbara plays everyday if possible, looking for pickup games 
from Redondo Beach to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
But Sabbara's true intensity shows during the season, including practice. 
</P>
<P>
"He almost practices harder than he plays in the games," Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said Sabbara, who is also Western's student body president, is a 
natural leader who demands hard work from his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Sabbara is so demanding that Hoffman has asked him not to chastise his 
teammates so vehemently in practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had to tell him, 'That's my job,' " Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Not all the guys are used to working as hard as Sam does. If they all worked 
as hard as Sam, we would never lose." 
</P>
<P>
Which is what Sabbara wants. He said the Pioneers have yet to play as a team. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't match up with the south county boys talent-wise, so we have to play 
harder and better to win," Sabbara said. 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMERS 
</P>
<P>
Rob Johnson was named the most valuable player of the Carson City, Nev., 
tournament after leading El Toro to the championship Friday. Johnson scored 18 
points in the Chargers' 59-50 victory over Carson City in the championship game 
and had 15 and 19 points in earlier tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
Loara's Tes Whitlock scored 23 points as the Saxons (8-0) beat Villa Park, 
90-73, and had 29 in a 67-64 victory over North of Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
San Clemente center Eddie Morgan scored 79 points in three games last week. In 
the San Dieguito tournament, he scored 29 points in a 93-90 double-overtime 
loss to Newport Harbor. He scored 18 and had 13 rebounds in a 71-49 victory 
over San Marcos and had 32 points and 14 rebounds as the Tritons beat Anaheim, 
76-71.

BY ALL ACCOUNTS, 1990S WILL COST BANKS, S&amp;LS; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: ANALYSTS SAY INDUSTRY UPHEAVAL IS FAR FROM OVER. THEY EXPECT MORE 
FAILURES AS WELL AS MORE CONSOLIDATION AMONG BANKS AND THRIFTS.

<TEXT>
<P>
After a decade of upheaval marked by the failure of two dozen local financial 
institutions, banks and thrifts in Orange County are cautiously approaching the 
1990s with the expectation that their businesses will gradually merge into one. 
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of the financial industry, prompted by the federal financial 
institutions bailout law, is already making savings and loans operate more like 
banks. Thrifts are substituting "bank" for "S&amp;L" in their names and 
offering consumer and commercial loans. And many banks are invading the 
S&amp;L's traditional bastion by making more home loans. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it, the only difference between a bank and a savings and loan 
now is the name," said Maurice L. McAlister, president of Downey Savings &amp; 
Loan in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Both banks and thrifts have collapsed in the past decade as deregulation 
ushered in a period of risky lending, intense competition and, in some cases, 
mismanagement. The failure of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan stands as 
a symbol of the troubled era. 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators seized the 29-branch institution after a three-year, 
politically charged battle with its management, headed by Phoenix developer 
Charles H. Keating Jr. Lincoln's failure may ultimately cost taxpayers more 
than $2 billion, leave 22,000 bondholders with large losses and cripple the 
careers of several United States senators. 
</P>
<P>
The debate over Lincoln will continue in 1990, as will the shakeout in the 
thrift and bank industries. And the new bailout legislation may force the 
demise of more institutions as they scramble to shore up their capital bases 
and curb losses from bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County in the few next years, the predicted softening in the economy, 
increased competition brought on by interstate banking and the forced writedown 
of bad loans should contribute to the demise of a dozen more banks and thrifts, 
consultants said. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue of the thrift industry is certain to hit taxpayers harder. The 
bailout law commits $166 billion in taxpayer funds to repair the devastated 
S&amp;L industry, though government officials say now that the job will cost 
more than $200 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Many thrifts will enter 1990 searching for capital. The bailout law requires 
S&amp;Ls to meet three new tests for capital, which is an institution's final 
reserve against losses. About 800 of the nation's 2,600 thrifts don't meet the 
initial requirements and more are likely to fall short. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, 10 thrifts didn't meet one or more of the new capital tests, 
based on data compiled as of June 30, the latest period for which figures are 
available. At least two of those thrifts have since raised additional capital 
-- Pacific Savings Bank in Costa Mesa through its sale to Royal Trustco of 
Toronto, and Delta Savings Bank in Westminster through an infusion from new 
investors. And others have taken steps to downsize to meet the regulatory 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
On a more encouraging note, 20 local thrifts meet initial tests for two of the 
capital requirements, based on June 30 statistics, and 18 of them already meet 
the final test for those capital levels, scheduled to take effect in five 
years. Calculations for a third test are unavailable for all county S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Still, industry consultants Gerry Findley of Brea and Edward Carpenter of Santa 
Ana predict that next year, at least two banks and three S&amp;Ls in the county 
will fail and up to six banks and eight S&amp;Ls will merge or be acquired. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, CommerceBank in Newport Beach is awaiting regulatory approval to buy 
California City Bank in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
On the S&amp;L side, two thrifts were closed this year, three more were seized 
by regulators and will be closed or merged, and Downey Savings is awaiting 
regulatory approval to merge its Butterfield Savings &amp; Loan unit in Santa 
Ana into the parent S&amp;L. In addition, Westport Savings Bank moved its 
headquarters back to Hanford from Mission Viejo and Constitution Federal 
Savings &amp; Loan will pull out of Tustin at the end of the year and return to 
Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the decade, the consultants said, what will be left in the county 
will be big banks, providing services to major businesses and individual 
account holders, and small banks, acting as boutique firms servicing small and 
mid-size businesses or offering unique services. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Carpenter believes, more trust companies will set up private 
banking offices throughout the county to establish "total banking 
relationships" with wealthy residents. Such operations, sometimes called 
personal banking, handles financial planning, asset management and investment 
analyses. 
</P>
<P>
Firms like the Boston Co., Northern Trust, Morgan Guaranty and Bankers Trust 
already are competing with the private banking offices of the four major 
California banks. 
</P>
<P>
On another front, full interstate banking becomes effective in 1991 in 
California. This will allow banks and companies from 38 Midwest and Eastern 
states to open shop in deposit-rich California. 
</P>
<P>
But those shopping for merger deals will be making their moves in 1990. Even 
after deals are worked out, it could take six months for regulators to approve 
them, so bankers and consultants said they expect the first deals to be sealed 
by mid-summer. 
</P>
<P>
Interstate banking should increase competition and provide good deals for 
customers, bankers said. But if the economy dives into the long-predicted 
recession, they said, few if any out-of-state banks will be moving into 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The consolidation of both the bank and thrift businesses will also contribute 
to the eventual formation of a single financial industry, experts said. Downey 
Savings &amp; Loan in Newport Beach, for instance, will start offering more 
banking services, such as car loans and commercial loans, McAlister said. 
</P>
<P>
Clyde Gossert, president of CommerceBank in Newport Beach, suspects the 
movement to a single industry might be going the other way. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't so much S&amp;Ls coming our way as it is banks going toward 
S&amp;Ls," Gossert said. "I've looked at a lot of banks, and they operate like 
S&amp;Ls. They go after big deposits, like jumbo certificates of deposit, and 
they do real estate lending." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, with most local and national thrifts limiting or curtailing mortgage 
operations because of concerns over capital levels, some bankers have stepped 
in to grab chunks of the home-lending market. 
</P>
<P>
Thrift executives complain that the bailout law, while praiseworthy in some 
respects, doesn't make economic sense in the way it limits their businesses to 
home lending and eliminates other successful strategies, which some greedy 
entrepreneurs had abused, causing many of the failures. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller thrifts, for instance, often relied on a few big borrowers for a steady 
stream of business, but the law drastically limits the amount that S&amp;Ls can 
loan to any single borrower. This forces borrowers to go to more lenders and 
hampers relationships that thrifts have built over the years, said Stephen W. 
Prough, president of Western Financial Savings Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Executives at large, healthy S&amp;Ls such as Downey and Western Financial 
expect the rules to be softened somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
"If the regulations were to remain the same for the next 10 or 12 years, it 
would not be worth it to have the responsibilities and management problems of a 
thrift," McAlister said. "In my judgment, there's no way the regulations can 
stay the same. They have to make a lot more changes to make them a lot more 
reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
He also complained that a large part of management time will be spent on 
adapting to the complexity of the new law and attendant rules. "That translates 
into a loss of earnings," he said, "because management's attention is being 
diverted to regulation, not business." 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L'S FACE NEW CAPITAL TESTS 
</P>
<P>
Savings and loans must meet three tests for maintaining an adequate level of 
capital. Figures for one test are not available yet. The other tests require 
S&amp;Ls to have tangible capital equal to 1.5% of their assets and to have 
core, or leveraged, capital equal to 3% of assets. 
</P>
<P>
Tangible capital is the basic cash that has been put into institutions over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Core capital is tangible capital plus certain intangible items, such as good 
will, which is the value that one company pays in excess for the basic value of 
a firm it acquires. 
</P>
<P>
The requirement for tangible capital gradually grows to 3% in five years, and 
the core capital test will no longer be used. The chart below lists Orange 
County S&amp;Ls and their assets and tangible and core capital levels as of 
June 30:

THEATER: ORANGE COUNTY 1980S; 
</P>
<P>
THANKS TO SCR, THE STAGE CAME OF AGE IN THE COUNTY IN '80S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whatever else the decade of the '80s meant for Orange County, in theater it 
signified the coming of age of South Coast Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
The maturation process for the county's most accomplished troupe -- and its 
only professional resident theater -- began in 1978 with the opening of a 
$3.5-million complex in Costa Mesa and culminated in 1988 with the nation's 
most coveted theatrical accolade, a Tony Award for distinguished achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in the history of Orange County theater -- including the birth and 
growth of the Grove Shakespeare Festival in Garden Grove, which is the 
second-most important theatrical development of the '80s -- can compare with 
the astonishing arc that SCR has traced in terms of artistic accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
Not the construction of the mammoth Orange County Performing Arts Center, 
which, when it comes to theater, is essentially an import house for Broadway 
antiques. Not the sporadic bursts of creativity at the Laguna Playhouse, which 
is chiefly a dowager that sometimes surprises with an original musical. 
</P>
<P>
Not the blossoming of the theater department at UC Irvine into one of the more 
widely respected university drama programs. Not the commendable devotion of 
community troupes that continue to thrive across the county. And certainly not 
the intermittent hope for a storefront-theater scene, nor the lagging fortunes 
of the dinner-theater circuit. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the decade's plays and playwrights? 
</P>
<P>
Of all the dramatists who made their marks in the '80s, it was David Mamet who 
seemed to soar above the rest with a body of work that excoriated the 
brutalizing materialism of the American Dream. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Mamet's characters were the real estate hustlers of "Glengarry Glen 
Ross" (the 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning play that appeared at SCR in 1987) or 
the sleazy Hollywood operators of "Speed-the-Plow" (the 1988 play that will 
appear at SCR in 1990), they exemplify the crisis of values in a dog-eat-dog 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more than any other playwright, Mamet probes the ugly underbelly of the 
Reagan years. In a scabrous idiom of four-letter words that glorify the 
language of the street, his plays scrutinize the macho ethos of male bonding, 
sexist posturing and vicious careerism that characterized much of the yuppified 
'80s at various levels of society. 
</P>
<P>
There were, of course, many other urgent voices of conscience: 
</P>
<P>
* South African playwright Athol Fugard brought his message about the moral 
disaster of racism to the American theater time and again with powerful dramas 
such as his autobiographical "Master Harold . . . and the Boys," then shifted 
his focus to the quest for personal salvation in "The Road to Mecca." 
</P>
<P>
* British playwright Caryl Churchill drew a bead on sexual hypocrisy in "Cloud 
9" and turned her scathing satirical eye on feminism in "Top Girls," both times 
catching the aura of the decade with brilliant theatricality. 
</P>
<P>
* American playwright Wallace Shawn confronted the long-term psychic aftermath 
of the Vietnam War in "Aunt Dan and Lemon," stirring controversy by drawing a 
parallel between the United States and Nazi Germany, and suggesting that an 
evil ideology of lies had insinuated itself into our seemingly civilized daily 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
SCR presented all of these works and scores of others by such playwrights as 
Sam Shepard ("Fool for Love," "Buried Child," "True West") and Tom Stoppard 
("The Real Thing"), keeping local playgoers current with the most provocative 
contemporary fare being offered at professional resident theaters elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuous by its absence, however, was the work of August Wilson, whose 
ambitious cycle of plays about the experience of black Americans in this 
century has been the major theatrical discovery of the '80s. Somehow, SCR has 
managed not to produce any of his plays -- "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom," "Joe 
Turner's Come and Gone," "Fences" and "The Piano Lesson" -- most of which have 
been widely presented at theaters around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Still, SCR has offered plenty of its own discoveries of the '80s -- world 
premieres of three plays by Keith Reddin, two by Craig Lucas and two by Beth 
Henley, among others -- as well as many highly acclaimed revivals of classics 
from Shakespeare to Shaw, Sheridan to Synge, Wilde to Brecht. 
</P>
<P>
SCR took a special pride in its close collaboration with Lucas, who was named 
an associate artist of the theater earlier this year. Between 1985 and 1988, 
SCR launched his "Three Postcards" and "Prelude to a Kiss" and has produced the 
West Coast premieres of two others, "Reckless" and "Blue Window." 
</P>
<P>
What connects each of these very different plays is Lucas' poetic evocation of 
urban Angst and isolation. He writes about characters who discover that they 
are forever separate, unable to know each other as deeply as they know 
themselves. The only way to bear such terrible knowledge -- according to the 
playwright's message, if you will -- is to love others as they are. 
</P>
<P>
Like any theater catering to a large subscription audience, SCR has also 
offered a considerable amount of moderately cultured fare. Over the past decade 
it presented such variants in this category as Hugh Leonard's "Da," Michael 
Frayn's "Benefactors" and Hugh Whitemore's "Breaking the Code." 
</P>
<P>
But none was more notable than Peter Shaffer's "Amadeus," which was to the '80s 
what his "Equus" had been to the '70s: a "masterpiece of middlebrow theater," 
as one SCR staffer put it, attributing the description to critic John Simon. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the single greatest contribution that SCR has made to the dramatic 
arts over the past decade probably had less to do with particular productions 
than with behind-the-scenes support for the writing of new plays through its 
Collaboration Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Colab, begun in 1985, has commissioned work from about two dozen playwrights -- 
David Henry Hwang, Richard Greenberg and Thomas Babe, to name only a few -- 
which as often as not can result in full productions being mounted elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Many arts institutions have undertaken all sorts of programs to foster the 
creation of original work during the '80s. But Colab's independent SCR 
endowment of more than $1 million -- the interest on which is devoted 
exclusively to new-play development -- may well be unique among professional 
resident theaters.

FURS' SOUND RESTYLED IN BASIC BLEAKNESS; 
</P>
<P>
ROCK: RICHARD BUTLER SAYS HIS POST-PUNK GROUP HAS ABANDONED COMMERCIAL 
SLEEKNESS AND REVIVED ITS EARLY, PRIMITIVE APPROACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the band's seminal days early this decade, the Psychedelic Furs seemed 
strongly influenced by David Bowie's avant-garde side, in their own unique 
post-punk way. With their last and most successful album, 1987's commercial 
breakthrough "Midnight to Midnight," some early fans thought the band had 
followed Bowie's lead once more -- by selling out. 
</P>
<P>
The new album "Book of Days" should assuage those fears. In the intervening 
time, bandleader Richard Butler let the Furs fly, returning with a dark sonic 
morass more akin to the early approach than the stuff of hits. 
</P>
<P>
And instead of a big Rock Show at the Forum a la two years ago, this tour 
they're playing what Butler promises is a moodier, less floodlighted show at 
smaller venues -- including dates tonight at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim, 
Wednesday at the McCallum Theater in Palm Desert and Friday and Saturday at the 
Pantages in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The band's hit LP a couple years back "didn't feel natural enough," says 
Butler. "It was too produced, and the chemistry -- not of the basic members of 
the band, but the other members that we had with us at that time -- wasn't 
right. Lyrically as well it's not the most mysterious thing I've ever written. 
It didn't sound like this band somehow. 
</P>
<P>
"And I think this record does. We felt it was time to just go in and make a 
record that we liked without worrying about whether it sounded commercial -- 
having as little production on it as possible and getting it to sound quite 
raw." 
</P>
<P>
That kind of sound is increasingly allowable, with the Cure having had massive 
success with a rather uncompromising album and the Jesus &amp; Mary Chain also 
doing surprisingly well. But Butler says his decision to return to that 
approach wasn't influenced by anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"England is a very fashion-conscious country, so at any one point you're likely 
to be displaced. If you're worried about being out of fashion, we would 
probably have been out of fashion in 1982 when the big ska/two-tone thing 
happened. I don't think fashion makes much difference. You either write good 
songs or you don't." 
</P>
<P>
 The Psychedelic Furs play tonight at 8 p.m. at the Celebrity Theatre, 201 E. 
Broadway, Anaheim. Tickets: $19.50. Information: (714) 999-9536.

In his long and illustrious career, Mickey Mouse has starred in more than 130 
cartoon film, television and stage productions, helped launch several theme 
parks, and starred in a merchandising bonanza. His name even served as a 
password for the World War II Allied Forces' D Day invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, Mickey has also been starring in ice extravaganzas conceived and 
produced by Kenneth Feld, who also produces the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; 
Bailey Circus. This year's edition, "Walt Disney's World on Ice Celebrates 
Mickey's Diamond Jubilee," re-creates scenes from Mickey's 60 years in show 
business. The two-hour show, which features 45 performers, opened Christmas 
night at the Anaheim Convention Center, where it will stay through Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, this has been a drawn-out birthday celebration. Mickey turned 60 last 
year; he made his debut in "Steamboat Willie" on Nov. 18, 1928. 
</P>
<P>
The characters appearing along with Mickey in the show are Minnie Mouse, Donald 
and Daisy Duck, Pluto and Goofy. The music they skate to runs the gamut from 
the expected Disney songs to show tunes, jazz and classical selections and, for 
the finale, patriotic numbers. 
</P>
<P>
The show also includes various soloists, a stunt skater, two pair skaters and a 
duo who performs comic acrobatics. 
</P>
<P>
According to company manager Roy Folgrapp, 36, portraying these characters 
requires special preparation for the skaters. "Traditionally, when you're a 
skater, you learn to look beautiful," he said the other day in Anaheim. "You 
don't learn to be Goofy -- to fall down on the ice and do stupid things. That 
takes a little training! "Small movements don't show up in a costume," he said, 
"so the skaters have to learn to do things that can be seen in the 90th row as 
well as the third." 
</P>
<P>
For the other skaters too, performing with the characters is something 
different. "Skating with Mickey Mouse is like skating with a legend," said 
Joseph Mero, 25, who joined the show in July. Mero, who is from Newport Beach, 
performs as a pair skater with Tricia Puccio, who is from Wisconsin, in 
"Steamboat Willie" and in the finale. 
</P>
<P>
Mero has entered many amateur competitions, and he has won several third-place 
awards in them. Mero, a Michigan native, came to California in 1983. He trained 
for six years at the Ice Capades Chalet in Costa Mesa. "The kids in the 
audience go wild. It really helps us, because they get into the show more, and 
they're hyper when we come out." 
</P>
<P>
According to Folgrapp, the show's most complicated number is "The Sorcerer's 
Apprentice," taken from the classic 1940 animated film "Fantasia," in which 
Mickey's ill-cast magic spell brings 36 brooms to life. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our precision number," he said. "It created major problems in the 
beginning, because the brooms all look alike, and people couldn't tell who they 
were following. Plus, it's in black light" -- that is, it's done with special 
fluorescent lighting -- "so you're doing intricate patterns in that glow." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most popular segments, Folgrapp said, is the sun show performed by 
Douglas Barnhart in the "Giant's Castle" number. In it, Barnhart, 21, performs 
stunts that include jumping over seven-foot-high silverware and a six-foot-high 
wedge of Swiss cheese, and through a veg-o-matic -- here a rectangular device 
with four crisscrossing blades that have been set aflame. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to push the limits of what the human body can do," Barnhart said of his 
fondness for stunt skating. "In the veg-o-matic," he said, "those blades are 
real steel, and the fire is real. The timing has to be consistent, and it has 
to be right. But I've never been seriously injured or missed a show." 
</P>
<P>
Barnhart joined the Disney cast in 1988. Until last year, he was an assistant 
manager and a skating instructor at the Laurel Plaza Ice Capade Chalet in North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
After the show closes in Anaheim, it will move to the Los Angeles Sports Arena, 
where it will run from Jan. 4 through 14, 
</P>
<P>
and to the Long Beach Arena, where it will run Jan. 17 through 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walt Disney's World on Ice Celebrates Mickey's Diamond Jubilee" runs through 
Jan. 2, except New Year's Day, at the Anaheim Convention Center, 800 W. Katella 
Ave., Anaheim. Performances today, Tuesday and Jan. 2 at 7:30 p.m.; Wednesday 
at noon and 7:30 p.m.; Thursday and Friday at 1:30 and 7:30 p.m.; noon, 3:30 
and 7:30 p.m. Saturday and 1 and 4 p.m. Sunday. Tickets: $8.50 to $12.

WRITER-DIRECTOR STASHES A DARK BUT COMIC DEBUT IN 'STORM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the pre-credit sequence, set in the winter of 1946, of David Winning's 
taut, ambitious and darkly comic "Storm," we watch three bank robbers, their 
faces hidden by ski masks, take a teller hostage, kill him and then bury their 
$750,000 haul in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
We then flash to the present and find two university students, the nerdy, 
klutzy Lowell (David Palfy) and his friend, the assured, easygoing Booker (Tom 
Schioler) off to a weekend in those same woods. Wouldn't you know they would 
cross paths with those same three crooks, who, having served 40-year sentences 
for killing the teller, are about to dig up their loot? 
</P>
<P>
This is the stuff of which B movies are made, but Canadian writer-director 
Winning goes way beyond genre requirements. As one would hope, he wrings all 
the suspense out of the two different generations of men stalking each other 
like warring survivalists, but goes much further to explore the psyches of 
Lowell and the ex-cons' leader, Jim (Stan Kane), a leathery Marlboro Man 
look-alike. Palfy's intense Lowell is eccentric, self-absorbed, given to 
nightmare fantasies, including one in which a mock-assassination game with 
Booker, played in the deserted halls of a campus classroom building, turns 
real, with Lowell ending up dead. 
</P>
<P>
If Lowell is haunted by insecurities and frustrations that he must overcome if 
he has a prayer of surviving a skirmish with Jim in the woods, the insatiably 
greedy Jim in turn finds himself haunted by fantasies of guilt, much to his 
surprise. Indeed, on one level, "Storm" works very effectively as a comment on 
the male psyche and how lethal the mix of fear and aggression can be when men 
have a need to prove their masculinity, for reasons imagined or real. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of the film's deft touches is that in an offhand way we're told that 
Lowell and Booker are old friends, possibly even from childhood. This is 
crucial, because had not these two young men shared a past in common, you could 
not otherwise imagine them becoming friends. In his debut film, made for 
$72,000, David Winning displays a fine understanding and command of his 
medium's visual resources. "Storm" (rated a lenient PG-13, considering all the 
bloodshed) should be an ideal calling card for Hollywood.

ZOIA CEAUSESCU WANTS POODLES IN JAIL WITH HER

<TEXT>
<P>
Bucharest television today showed Zoia Ceausescu, the daughter of executed 
Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu who was arrested Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
She appeared haggard, leaning against a wall in the garden of a family home, 
cigarette in hand, by the luxurious apartment in which she had lived. 
</P>
<P>
Before she was driven away in an armored car, she asked: "Do you have room in 
the police truck for my poodles?" 
</P>
<P>
The television also showed jewelry confiscated from the young woman, who 
evidently shared a taste for luxuries with her slain mother, Elena. 
</P>
<P>
Among the items displayed were seven expensive watches, jewelry, $95,000 in 
cash, valuable paintings taken from Romanian art museums and pearls "which we 
don't think are false." 
</P>
<P>
"Such a modest baggage for such a long trip (to jail)," the commentator said 
sarcastically. 
</P>
<P>
The TV also showed meat supposedly shipped in from Vienna for her dogs. 
</P>
<P>
A high-level Romanian defector said in a book published last year that he 
reported to Elena Ceausescu once a week with tapes secretly recorded at the 
residences of her children -- Zoia, Nicu and Valentin -- so she could keep tabs 
on them.

MENTAL PATIENT HELD IN DEATH

<P>
A Camarillo State Hospital patient was being held today in connection with the 
death of a fellow patient after the two had fought, the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark W. Wagner, 37, was found dead in his bed at 5:15 a.m. Monday by attendants 
at the psychiatric hospital who had checked on him periodically after a 4 a.m. 
fight with Michael Thomas, 37, a patient in the same unit, Lt. Joe Harwell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that the two had argued earlier, which resulted in Thomas attacking 
the victim and knocking him to the ground," Harwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Another patient called for help and attendants separated the two. Wagner was 
examined by the hospital's medical staff, Harwell said. "At that time he was 
thought to be all right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was checked out. He seemed OK," said John Fortner, a spokesman for the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour after the fight, an attendant noticed that Wagner had stopped 
breathing, and efforts to revive him failed. Thomas was arrested and taken to 
the county jail in Ventura, where he was being held in lieu of $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Harwell said an autopsy was scheduled for later today.

SAMUEL BECKETT, AUTHOR OF 'GODOT' AND WINNER OF NOBEL, IS DEAD AT 83 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Samuel Beckett, whose "Waiting For Godot" and other tragicomic plays of 
brooding despair revolutionized 20th-Century theater, died in a Paris nursing 
home at the age of 83 and was buried today in strict secrecy, four days after 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
Editions de Minuit, the French publishing house that turned the spotlight on 
Beckett after printing "Waiting for Godot," said the death Friday of the 
Dublin-born dramatist had been kept quiet to respect his lifelong desire for 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
"It was his wish," said the daughter of Jerome Lindon. Lindon published the 
enigmatic play in 1952, a year after agreeing to print one of Beckett's first 
novels, "Molloy," a difficult text turned down by established publishers. 
</P>
<P>
The Nobel Prize-winning author was buried in Montparnasse cemetery beside his 
wife, Suzanne, who died last July. 
</P>
<P>
A pot of yellow flowers, a plant and a single candle stood on the gravestone 
after the funeral, a simple ceremony attended by a score of close friends, with 
no priest and no speeches. 
</P>
<P>
The tall, gaunt writer never gave press interviews and refused to travel to 
Stockholm to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
But the reclusive Irishman was a familiar figure in some of Paris' oldest 
literary cafes, especially the Closeries des Lilas, not far from his 
Montparnasse apartment and once a favorite haunt of figures such as Ernest 
Hemingway and V. I. Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
Beckett moved to France in 1937 after giving up a job as a university lecturer 
in Ireland and roaming Europe in a style reminiscent of the hobos who are 
featured in his later work. 
</P>
<P>
In 1938, he was stabbed by a man asking for money and rushed to a hospital by a 
young woman, a stranger who became his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Although Beckett was influenced by his friend and fellow-countryman James 
Joyce, his sparse writing was the exact opposite. His tragicomic plays, colored 
with a brooding pessimism, cast aside conventional plot, time and characters. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of my work, there is nothing but dust," he once said. British 
theater critic Martin Esslin quoted him as saying: "I am an analyzer, trying to 
leave out as much as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Lindon, who has published 22 of Beckett's works, said in a recent interview 
that he took on the then obscure writer in the early 1950s because "I knew 
immediately he was one of the greatest writers of our time." 
</P>
<P>
His first encounter with Beckett's work was "one of the great moments of my 
life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Beckett wrote with equal ease in French or English, translating his own texts 
from one language to the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Waiting for Godot," the story of two tramps who wait for Godot, who never 
comes, has been translated into several dozen languages and influenced a 
generation of playwrights, including Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard and Edward 
Albee. 
</P>
<P>
At a nursing home where Beckett lived for most of the last 18 months, a 
spokeswoman said the writer never mentioned his wife's death. "It's not that he 
didn't care, but he never mentioned it," she said.

Messianic Jews are not entitled to automatic Israeli citizenship, Israel's 
Supreme Court has ruled, concluding that their belief in Jesus makes them 
Christians instead of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, published in Israeli newspapers today, was a boost to 
ultra-Orthodox religious interpretations of the state's 1950 Law of Return. The 
law forms the basis of Jewish immigration to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The law and its subsequent amendments defines a Jew as a person born to a 
Jewish mother or who converts to Judaism and professes no other faith. 
</P>
<P>
Orthodox politicians have long sought a more precise definition, and the 
court's Christmas Day ruling has resolved one issue. 
</P>
<P>
The 100-page decision said belief in Jesus makes one a member of another faith 
and ineligible for automatic Israeli citizenship.

A top aide to former Panamanian dictator Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega pleaded 
not guilty today to federal charges that he acted as an intermediary between 
Noriega and Colombian cocaine traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Luis del Cid, 46 -- who surrendered Monday to U.S. troops and was quickly flown 
from Panama to the United States -- is one of five Panamanians, including 
Noriega, who were named in 1988 drug indictments in Florida. He was ordered 
held by federal authorities pending a bond hearing Jan. 2 in which federal 
prosecutors are expected to ask that bail be denied. 
</P>
<P>
Del Cid appeared calm and at ease during his appearance in U.S. District Court, 
but complained of problems with asthma. He was dressed in a wrinkled blue 
sports shirt and khaki slacks. 
</P>
<P>
Del Cid is charged with racketeering, drug trafficking and conspiracy to 
traffic in cocaine. He faces a possible prison sentence of 70 years, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges that Del Cid, a lieutenant colonel in Panama's military, 
"acted as liaison, courier and emissary for Manuel Antonio Noriega in his 
transactions with drug traffickers."

The son of deposed Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu tried to flee Bucharest 
hiding in the back seat of a car driven by a heavily perfumed woman who 
identified him as her lover, a Hungarian newspaper said today. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Maru, a printer, told the Nepszabadsag he overpowered Nicu Ceausescu and 
then took him to the TV center in Bucharest, where the notorious playboy 
appeared on camera looking dazed and bruised. 
</P>
<P>
Maru said he had been checking cars near Bucharest's Baneasa domestic airport 
Friday with a group of young men when a Romanian-made car approached. 
</P>
<P>
"A very elegant woman was driving the car. . . . We saw that a man was sitting 
behind, his cap completely pulled down. 
</P>
<P>
"I reached in and pulled off his cap. I saw it was Nicu. He got out of the car 
and pretended to search for his papers. Then suddenly he ran away. I ran after 
him and jumped on him. I twisted his arm behind his back. My buddies got there 
too and helped."

DOW DECLINES 2.13 AMID CONCERN OVER INFLATION, INTEREST

<P>
Prices closed narrowly mixed on Wall Street today after concerns about 
inflation and higher interest rates eroded the stock market's earlier moderate 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 2.13 to 2,709.26. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues were slightly ahead of decliners on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 695 stocks rising, 675 falling and 550 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled a thin 77.61 million shares, against 120.98 million in 
the previous session. Many traders were extending the Christmas holiday 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 0.23 to 191.72. 
</P>
<P>
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index slipped 0.04 to 370.84. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks tracked the bond market for much of the session, declining in early 
trading as Treasury prices slumped. Wall Street later shook off the drop in 
bonds, but in late afternoon, when bond prices continued to drop, stocks gave 
up their gains. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury prices skidded first because of an increase in a key Japanese interest 
rate and in later trading because of a surge in oil prices after several oil 
companies reported refinery shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The January price for a gallon of home heating oil jumped nearly 10.74 cents to 
92.48 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while the Treasury's 30-year 
bond was down about 1 1/4 point, or $12.50 per $1,000 in face amount. The 
bond's yield soared to 7.98% from 7.88% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Rising energy prices are considered a harbinger of higher inflation and, in 
turn, higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices fell sharply and Treasury bill yields rose in early trading today 
amid wide selling by dealers reducing their portfolios at the year's end. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down 21/32 point, or $6.56 per $1,000 
face amount, around midday. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, jumped to 
7.93% from 7.88% late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The credit markets were closed Monday for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the selling was dominated by dealers and not customers and that 
prices reacted sharply because overall dealings were thin. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
fell 7/32 point to 3/8 point, intermediate maturities declined 3/8 point to 
15/32 point and long-term issues were down 9/16 point to 11/16 point, according 
to Telerate Inc., the financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 3.97 to 1,190.19. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills leaped to 7.92% as the discount gained 10 
basis points to 7.68%. Yields on six-month bills climbed to 7.95% as the 
discount increased 12 basis points to 7.56%. Yields on one-year bills were up 
to 7.79% as the discount gained 11 basis points to 7.27%.

U.S. trading in the stock of Campeau Corp., which was halted Friday, did not 
resume today because the Toronto Stock Exchange was closed for a holiday, an 
official at the National Assn. of Securities Dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto-based Campeau disclosed Friday that its bankers believe it has 
technically defaulted on $2.34 billion in debt. The retailer's stock is traded 
on the Toronto exchange as well as on the U.S. over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau last traded at 3 5/8 in the United States before trading was halted 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Campeau is the biggest department store operator in the United States with 
chains including Bloomingdale's and Abraham &amp; Straus. The company said 
earlier this month that its Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores 
Inc. units may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection.

BLUE LAWS DILUTE NEW YEAR'S EVE SPIRITS; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAYS: LIQUOR SELLERS IN SOME STATES ARE LEFT SINGING THE PRE-MIDNIGHT BLUES 
OVER BAN ON SUNDAY SALES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Most states have some sort of law restricting liquor sales on Sundays. So when 
New Year's Eve falls on a Sunday, as it does this year, it's a 
less-than-festive holiday for those who make a living selling alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it will hurt the industry," said Ray Brezzo, who owns a liquor store 
in Glastonbury, Conn. "We're very, very pessimistic." 
</P>
<P>
In Connecticut, as in many Northeastern states, bars and restaurants can serve 
alcohol on Sundays but liquor stores cannot sell it. For New Year's Eve, Brezzo 
is hoping his customers will buy what they need on Saturday -- but he's far 
from confident. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows what to expect," he said. "Everybody's sort of sitting on the 
edge of their seat." 
</P>
<P>
Liquor stores in New York City are posting signs to remind customers to buy 
early. In Grand Forks, N.D., Happy Harry's Bottle Shop is taking out newspaper 
advertisements with a similar reminder. 
</P>
<P>
Still, owner Hal Gershman said, "No matter how much advertising you do, and how 
much you try to tell people, there are still 60% of the people who don't pay 
attention and will show up at the last minute." 
</P>
<P>
In Alabama, where restaurants and nightclubs cannot sell alcohol between 2 a.m. 
and midnight Sunday, some places will hold parties the night before. Others 
will start their festivities at midnight. As in several other Southern states, 
private clubs are exempt from the law. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Fuller, general manager of American Pie, a 2-month-old Montgomery 
nightclub without a private license, said he'll throw a bash on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's just not going to have the same whiz-bang as New Year's Eve," he 
said. "Obviously, it's a big loss. A day-before-New Year's Eve party, that 
sounds pretty goofy."

COLD WAVE WREAKS HAVOC ON FLORIDA'S CITRUS CROP

<P>
The frigid weather that swept through much of the South over the holiday 
weekend has caused substantial damage to Florida's $3.5-billion citrus crop and 
hurt other important winter crops, agriculture officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
"This freeze has just devastated us," said Anne Goodnight, Collier County 
commissioner. She said she planned to ask Gov. Bob Martinez for disaster aid 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, state officials estimated that 70% of the citrus crop and 80% of the 
winter vegetable crop were destroyed when temperatures plunged into the low 20s 
and upper teens. 
</P>
<P>
Losses there were estimated at $200 million. But some Texas officials and 
growers predicted that they will be higher because warming temperatures ruined 
any hopes of salvaging the frozen fruit for juice. 
</P>
<P>
Although Florida officials did not release actual production losses, the freeze 
damage is likely to be substantial since much of the state's crop was still on 
the trees when temperatures dipped below freezing starting Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The plunging temperatures taxed the state's utilities over the weekend and 
again today. The power companies tried to divide the misery by cutting 
electricity to different areas for short periods of time, but the moves wreaked 
havoc on citrus groves. 
</P>
<P>
Most growers abandoned traditional methods of protecting their crops, such as 
using smudge pots or wind machines, and instead used networks of microjets, 
which spray water on the trees to protect them from freezing. 
</P>
<P>
When the power went off, the protective irrigation systems failed. 
</P>
<P>
Immokalee, a winter vegetable production center, was hit hard by the chill. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers said the area lost more than 90% of its tomatoes, peppers and other 
vegetables.

JAPAN PENALIZES DAIWA SECURITIES FOR FALSE REPORTS

The Finance Ministry sent a clear warning to Japan's freewheeling securities 
industry today when it punished the nation's No. 2 broker for filing false 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry ordered Daiwa Securities not to raise funds for itself in the 
market for the time being as punishment for the reports, which hid 
stock-dealing losses, a ministry official said. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry also asked Daiwa's investment service division, responsible for 
the reports, to voluntarily refrain from business for two days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said that although the punishment was considered lenient, the 
ministry went one step beyond its usual slap on the wrist. 
</P>
<P>
The Daiwa division at the center of the scandal was reported in the Japanese 
media of having tried to boost stock sales to corporate customers by 
guaranteeing against losses on their investments.

EASTERN COLD WAVE CHILLS HOLIDAY BOX OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cold chill that has gripped most of the nation during the holidays is 
having a similar numbing effect in Hollywood, despite the local balmy outdoor 
temperatures. For the second week in a row, business was dramatically down at 
American theaters, throwing an eleventh-hour wrench in the industry's record 
box-office year. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales for the Top 10 films over the four-day Christmas weekend dipped 
almost 25% over the same period a year ago and bad weather only accounted for 
part of it. Audiences have simply not warmed up to many of the movies on this 
year's holiday menu. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, people were easily lured out of the shopping aisles by such films as 
"Rain Man," "Twins," "Working Girl," "The Naked Gun" and "Dirty Rotten 
Scoundrels," all of which went on to record solid box-office grosses. 
</P>
<P>
The "prestige" films of 1989 are doing well in limited release -- Oliver 
Stone's critically-praised "Born on the Fourth of July" averaged a weighty 
$39,964 at four theaters during its initial weekend -- but movies in broad 
release are playing to less than packed houses. 
</P>
<P>
The No. 1 film over the weekend was Chevy Chase's holiday spoof "National 
Lampoon's Christmas Vacation," which in its third week grossed an estimated 
$7.1 million on 1,950 screens. In comparison, last year's box-office leader 
"Twins" took in $8.9 million at almost 400 fewer locations. 
</P>
<P>
"Tango and Cash," a cop-buddy movie starring Sylvester Stallone and Kurt 
Russell, took a beating from critics but still managed to finish second with an 
estimated $6.7 million, while Steven Spielberg's "Always" disproved the notion 
that Spielberg movies always open big. The Richard Dreyfuss-Holly Hunter 
fantasy romantic adventure took in just $3.7 million at 1,016 theaters.

Actress Jessica Lange has become accustomed to working in movies that are not 
commercial films. 
</P>
<P>
"So if one of them does become that, it would be a real surprise to me," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just because I'm attracted to things that are somewhat out of the 
mainstream," she said in an interview in the January issue of Premiere 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-old Lange's latest roles are in Costa-Gavras' "Music Box," in which 
she plays a Chicago lawyer contesting charges that her father is a Nazi war 
criminal, and in Paul Brickman's "Men Don't Leave," in which she plays a newly 
widowed mother. 
</P>
<P>
"The roles and the stories that make it interesting for me to spend six months 
or three months of my life involved in the playing of are maybe not what's 
going to appeal to the majority, which is fine," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lange lives with actor-playwright Sam Shepard, and they have two children. She 
has a third child by dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov.

Ken Voss never saw Jimi Hendrix perform live. But he's spent the 19 years since 
the death of the counterculture guitarist keeping his music alive for later 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny when I go on tour with Hendrix material or stage concerts devoted 
to his music," Voss said recently. "We get the 14-year-olds and the 
34-year-olds, but the 24-year-olds don't seem to know who Jimi Hendrix was. 
</P>
<P>
"There's sort of a gap there -- part of a generation apparently doesn't realize 
what a force Hendrix exerted on the music performed today." 
</P>
<P>
Voss is trying to close the gap, spreading the word about the acid rocker who 
used his teeth on the guitar strings in an unsettling, feedback-laden rendition 
of the national anthem at the Woodstock music festival. 
</P>
<P>
A former music journalist, Voss, 38, is founder of the Jimi Hendrix Information 
Management Institute (JIMI), curator of a mobile museum of the star's 
memorabilia and editor of a quarterly newsletter titled "Voodoo Child," a name 
taken from a Hendrix hit. 
</P>
<P>
He's become a one-man clearinghouse of information about the Seattle-born 
Hendrix since the musician's drug-related death in Britain Sept. 18, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"As my wife says, I'm a fan turned fanatic, I spend 12 to 20 hours a week on 
Jimi Hendrix," said Voss.

FAMILY ASKS AUTOPSY NOT BE DONE ON MARTIN 
</P>

<P>
An autopsy on former New York Yankee Manager Billy Martin was canceled today at 
his family's request, and a prosecutor said the decision could make it harder 
to press charges against the driver of the truck in which Martin died. 
</P>
<P>
The Broome County Sheriff's Department reported slow progress in investigating 
the Christmas night accident that killed Martin, 61, and injured his longtime 
friend, William Reedy of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff Anthony Ruffo said it will be another day or two before the alcohol 
level in Reedy's blood is confirmed through laboratory tests. 
</P>
<P>
Reedy was charged Christmas night with a misdemeanor charge of driving while 
intoxicated and faces a fine of up to $1,000 and a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Ruffo posted a sheriff's deputy on the rural road where the accident occurred 
to direct a flood of traffic as reporters from across the country came to see 
the site where Martin, the pugnacious, hard-drinking former second baseman who 
was fired five times as Yankee manager, died. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say the pickup skidded off an icy road early Monday evening in 
front of Martin's 148-acre farm near Binghamton, about 150 miles northwest of 
New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Broome County Dist. Atty. Gerald Mollen said he hoped to persuade Coroner 
Patrick Ruddy to conduct an autopsy despite the family's wishes in order to 
pinpoint the exact cause of Martin's death. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping that's not the final decision, to tell you the truth," Mollen said. 
"It's unusual that a coroner would not have an autopsy conducted when cause of 
death may be a legal question." 
</P>
<P>
Ruddy said an autopsy on Martin's body would reveal little that an external 
examination did not. 
</P>
<P>
"He died, basically, of a fractured neck," Ruddy said. "The chest X-ray was 
reasonably intact, belly was normal, blood count was normal. It's all in the 
neck area." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of an autopsy would mean that Martin's state of intoxication at the 
time of his death might never be known. Mollen and Ruffo said whether or not 
Martin was drunk would be irrelevant to any case against Reedy. 
</P>
<P>
Reedy, owner of Reedy's Bar near Detroit's Tiger Stadium, suffered a broken hip 
and possible broken ribs in the accident. He was listed in fair condition today 
at the Upstate Medical Center Hospital in Syracuse, where he was transferred 
after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Mollen said it would be "days, at least" before he decides whether to charge 
Reedy with anything more serious than driving while intoxicated, such as 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
He said a grand jury could take up the case as soon as the investigation was 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of an autopsy would not preclude further charges, Mollen said. "It's 
not necessary in every case to have an autopsy to determine the cause of 
death." 
</P>
<P>
Ruffo said investigators had not made much progress in tracing Martin's 
movements in the hours before his death. 
</P>
<P>
"They were out on an errand and apparently were doing a little bit of shopping 
before dinner," the sheriff said. 
</P>
<P>
Reedy said he and Martin had gone to a store and then stopped for a quick drink 
at a Binghamton bar Reedy could not identify, according to Deputy Steve 
Glanville, who issued the DWI ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Icy, slippery roads and Reedy's unfamiliarity with the area were believed to be 
factors in the accident, Ruffo said. He said the speed limit on the road that 
the truck skidded off was 55 m.p.h., but he did not know how fast the truck had 
been going. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his wife, Martin's survivors include son Billy Joe of Lubbock, 
Tex., and daughter, Kelly, both from previous marriages. 
</P>
<P>
A viewing for Martin will be Thursday at the Frank Campbell Funeral Home in New 
York. Services will be Friday at St. Patrick's Cathedral.

HERSHISER'S SUMMER OF '88: THE BEST SHOW OF THE DECADE

<P>
The record stood for 20 years, 58 2/3 scoreless innings, a tribute to Don 
Drysdale's pitching dominance during the summer of 1968. 
</P>
<P>
To break it would require a level of pitching consistency rarely achieved -- 
six straight shutouts and then some. Orel Hershiser, ace of the Dodgers, 
figured old Double D's mark was safe, especially from him. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I would break the record," Hershiser said. "I thought nobody 
would break the record. But now I think somebody can break it, because I'm 
nobody special." 
</P>
<P>
He was wrong there. Orel Hershiser was more than special in September, 1988. He 
bordered on the unhittable, throwing 59 consecutive scoreless innings -- 67 if 
you include the playoffs -- to punctuate the Dodgers' rush to the National 
League West title. 
</P>
<P>
The achievement was voted Performance of the Decade in a poll of sports writers 
and broadcasters conducted by the Associated Press, receiving 156 votes to far 
outdistance the four gold medals won by Carl Lewis in the 1984 Olympic Games, 
which had 77 votes. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Wayne Gretzky breaking hockey's 200-point barrier (76 votes), Roger 
Clemens' record 20-strikeout game (30), Steffi Graf's tennis Grand Slam (29), 
Jose Canseco's 40-homer/40-steal season (26), Eric Dickerson's 2,105-yard 
season (15), Dan Marino's 200 career touchdowns (14), U.S. Olympic Miracle on 
Ice (12), Matt Biondi's seven Olympic medals (7), Butch Reynolds' 400-meter 
record (6), Woody Stephens' five straight Belmont winners (5), Greg LeMond's 
Tour de France victories (2), Greg Louganis' 1988 Olympics (2) and Jack 
Nicklaus' last nine holes at the 1986 Masters. 
</P>
<P>
Drysdale, a Dodgers broadcaster, got to watch Hershiser's streak up close and 
marveled at the pitcher's consistency. "Orel's been in complete control," 
Drysdale said after the second 1-0 game. "He's in such a groove. He's worked so 
hard. You just like to see him do well." 
</P>
<P>
When the streak reached 58 innings on Sept. 30 at San Diego -- Drysdale's mark 
had been amended by baseball's record keepers to eliminate the fraction -- 
Hershiser asked Dodgers Manager Tommy Lasorda to lift him from the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I did it out of respect for Don," he said. "I think he's a much better pitcher 
than I am. He's a Hall of Famer. I thought it would be a lot better if we were 
both sitting up there on top." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda refused. Hershiser went back to work for one more inning, recorded 
three more outs and claimed the record that ranks as the Performance of the 
Decade.

Colorado Coach Bill McCartney says he is willing to talk with university 
officials about renegotiating his contract, but he will not discuss it with the 
news media. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney and his team are in Miami preparing for their Orange Bowl showdown 
New Year's night with Notre Dame. If the Buffs win, they will be national 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
University President Gordon Gee has said he wants to renegotiate McCartney's 
contract after the season. The eight-year coach is in the third year of a 
four-year contract, but McCartney has gone on record as saying he does not want 
to extend his contract until it runs out. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that if university officials want to talk about a new 
contract, he will listen. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, if any of my bosses want to talk to me, I'll talk to them, just 
like anyone would," McCartney said.

FERRY ISN'T CERTAIN HE'LL RETURN TO THE CAVS NEXT YEAR

Danny Ferry, who plays basketball for Rome's Il Messaggero team, is undecided 
about whether he will play for the Cleveland Cavaliers next season. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland owns the rights to Ferry, after a trade that sent Ron Harper to the 
Clippers. Ferry bypassed the Clippers to play in Italy, where he is averaging 
22 points and earning $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry said the NBA would be rougher on him. 
</P>
<P>
"I am the first to admit that this isn't the NBA," he said in an interview 
published today in the Akron Beacon Journal. "It's mostly like college ball. 
Some of it major college, some not." 
</P>
<P>
Basketball is relatively new to Italy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Soccer still owns the country like nothing I've ever seen," he said. "It is 
like baseball and football all put together. When there is a match, people 
carry the garbage out with transistor radios pressed to their ears." 
</P>
<P>
As fans filed into the Messaggero game recently, they carried radios and 
unleashed a huge cheer when a local soccer team scored a goal. 
</P>
<P>
They also bring enthusiasm to basketball. Fans come to their feet for any dunk, 
regardless how mundane. They mockingly whistle when an opposing player has 
problems, and they take special delight at an opponent's missed free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The Italians permit each team to sign two foreigners, or "strangers," as they 
are known. Usually the players are Americans, fading stars or players who spent 
most of their life on the end of an NBA bench. 
</P>
<P>
The average American player earns about $300,000, the average Italian about 
$100,000. If a team is losing, the usual move is to dump the Americans and 
bring in two more. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of horror stories about guys being used," Ferry said. "You 
have to be careful which team you sign with. Messaggero treats its players the 
best, but some of the others aren't well run." 
</P>
<P>
The games seem to be slow, methodical and physical. Few shots are blocked; 
there is little quickness. It is definitely played under the rim. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than jump over you or go around, guys just go through you," Ferry said.

49ERS FAVORED TO WIN ANOTHER SUPER BOWL, BUT AGAINST WHOM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE GOLDBERG, AP FOOTBALL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The confusion and contingencies are over and the NFL playoff lineup is set with 
San Francisco the favorite to win yet another Super Bowl. The NFC is looking as 
dominant as ever, and teams like the Saints, Lions and Chiefs are poised for a 
rush into the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
It was a year in which everything was the same and everything was different. 
</P>
<P>
The playoff favorites are familiar: The 49ers, Giants, Browns, Broncos, Rams, 
Bills and Eagles have all been there before. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a sense, the season belonged to teams like the Saints, who missed the 
playoffs but spoiled two other teams' parties, and coming teams like the 
Packers, Lions and Chiefs, all of whom can build on late-season momentum. 
</P>
<P>
At the other extreme are the Falcons, Jets and perhaps even the Bears, who have 
to start from scratch. So do the Cowboys, who look like something worse than an 
expansion team after going 1-15. 
</P>
<P>
"No question about it, we have laid the foundation for the future," said Coach 
Marty Schottenheimer of Kansas City after turning a 4-11 team to 8-7-1. The 
Lions used Barry Sanders' dazzling legs to win their final five games and New 
Orleans unearthed little-known quarterback John Fourcade to win its final 
three. 
</P>
<P>
As for the playoffs, starting next Sunday with the wild-card games, two 11-5 
teams will meet in the NFC game when the Rams visit Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The AFC game will involve two teams from the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's 29-21 victory over Cincinnati on Monday night not only gave the 
Vikings (10-6) the NFC Central title put knocked out the defending AFC champs 
and put Pittsburgh in the playoffs for the first time in five years. The 
Steelers will be at Houston on Sunday. Both were 9-7 this season. 
</P>
<P>
The divisional playoffs will take place the following week. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, 14-2, will be host to either the Eagles or the Vikings. The New York 
Giants, 12-4, will be at home to either the Rams or the Central winner. 
</P>
<P>
In the AFC, Denver, 11-5, will play host to the wild-card winner and Buffalo 
(9-7) will be at Cleveland, which beat Houston 24-20 Saturday night to finish 
9-6-1 and win the Central for the fourth time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers will be the favorites to become the first team since Pittsburgh a 
decade ago to win two straight Super Bowls, although their path won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
They went 3-1 against the Rams, Giants and Eagles this year, splitting with Los 
Angeles and beating the Giants and Eagles. But none of those games was easy -- 
they trailed the Eagles by 11 points in the fourth quarter and needed a 
fortuitous offside penalty to beat New York after letting the Giants rally from 
a 24-7 deficit to tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it would be hard to argue against any team from the NFC, 
which already has a streak of five straight Super Bowl victories and has won 
seven of nine in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, Rams, Giants and Eagles were 14-2 in games against AFC teams and the 
Eagles and Giants both beat the AFC's best, Denver, at Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Saints' 41-6 win Sunday over the Colts, who could have made the 
playoffs with a victory, underscores NFC superiority. In fact, 9-7 New Orleans, 
4-0 against AFC teams, and 10-6 Washington, non-playoff teams in the NFC, would 
be strong challengers in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans may have found the answer at quarterback in Fourcade, who joined 
the Saints as a strike replacement two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old journeyman, who has played for seven teams in Canada, the USFL, 
the Arena Football League and the NFL, threw for eight touchdowns in wins over 
Buffalo, Philadelphia and Indianapolis -- the first two playoff teams, the last 
a contender. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers and Lions also made dramatic improvement in the NFC Central. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders, last year's Heisman Trophy winner, rushed for a team-record 1,470 
yards, just 10 short of the league-leading total of 1,480 by Christian Okoye of 
the Chiefs. Even more, he gave the Lions a visibility they haven't had for a 
decade, and their 7-9 record, forged on five closing wins, gives them hope for 
the future, particularly since they have strong young defensive players like 
Jerry Ball, Chris Spielman and Bennie Blades. 
</P>
<P>
The Packers went from 4-12 to 10-6 as quarterback Don Majkowski emerged as a 
two-minute quarterback to rival Joe Montana; Tim Harris became the northland's 
version of Lawrence Taylor, and Sterling Sharpe looked like the next Jerry 
Rice. 
</P>
<P>
"I defy anyone to tell us that they thought this is where we'd be," said Coach 
Lindy Infante, not withstanding his team's soft schedule and four one-point 
wins. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are Schottenheimer's Chiefs, led by rookie linebacker Derrick 
Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
They would have made the playoffs had they not been upset at home in Week 15 by 
San Diego, which won its last two to finish 6-10. The Chargers also could be -- 
well, charging -- particularly if Bobby Beathard replaces the fired Steve 
Ortmayer at general manager and makes the quick fixes he's known for. 
</P>
<P>
One problem for both: a good young quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
At the bottom, there are a lot of problems, although a good young quarterback 
is one thing Dallas doesn't need -- Troy Aikman showed enough to indicate he'll 
be worth the $11 million the Cowboys paid. 
</P>
<P>
But in taking Steve Walsh, who may be traded, in the supplemental draft, they 
blew the No. 1 pick in this year's draft, and the rest of the team consists 
either of aging stars like Everson Walls and Too Tall Jones or castoffs. The 
passel of draft picks they got for Herschel Walker will help. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta, 3-13, will get the first pick that Dallas doesn't have and should use 
it on Alabama linebacker Keith McCants if McCants decides to bypass his senior 
year and the league lets him in. No less a personage than Taylor calls him "the 
Lawrence Taylor of the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
But the pick will be made with a new coach -- perhaps Duke's Steve Spurrier, 
perhaps an assistant like San Francisco's Mike Holmgren, Denver's Wade 
Phillips, Cincinnati's Bruce Coslet or Minnesota's Floyd Peters. A long-shot -- 
McCants' college coach, Bill Curry, who recently turned down a long-term 
extension of his contract,. 
</P>
<P>
And the Bears? 
</P>
<P>
After five straight NFC Central titles, they went from 4-0 to 6-10, losing 
their final six games as injuries and age destroyed one of the decade's top 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ditka will stay on for one more year and he probably needs a quarterback, 
for starters. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe we're that bad a team," he said after Sunday's 26-0 loss in 
San Francisco. "Although after today, I guess you have to believe that."

BETTING THE SYSTEMS: TOP WEIGHT CAN PAY OFF WITH TOP DOLLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By by NORMAN DASH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a track's racing secretary puts weight on the ponies, he has an ulterior 
motive. His job, a calculating one, is to make the nags equal despite their 
relative talent. That is, when the horses hit the wire, all the noses will be 
in a straight line and tied for first place. 
</P>
<P>
Such shenanigans, of course, are strictly legal, inasmuch as it's the track 
official who sets up the race rather than the poor schnook with the holes in 
his shoes who does the betting or the jockey who decides while racing to 
nonchalantly give his pony a jolt by electrically charging his horse to make it 
go faster. 
</P>
<P>
Most likely, when the secretary sees his weight figures blown day after day, it 
will be the men in the lightweight white coats who will drag him away and not 
the guys in the heavy blue coats. 
</P>
<P>
Although a weight theory as concocted by the tracks sounds logical, rarely does 
it work out. How often is there a dead heat? Rarer yet, when was the last time 
a triple-dead heat occurred? 
</P>
<P>
In any case, no pursuer of the riches at the fingertips of the bettors at the 
track can ignore the weight factor. It's like when you ask a mountain climber 
why he's attempting such a dangerous pursuit; he'll tell you, "Because it's 
there." 
</P>
<P>
However, many professional handicappers and bettors alike, when they see a nag 
dropping a couple of pounds off his last race, believe it's time for the nag to 
make amends for past losses. Others wait to chunk it in only after a steed 
loses a substantial amount -- say five pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the way these handicappers and bettors figure, high weight could be 
an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, on May 3, 1989, at Hollywood Park, the eighth race saw Corvettin, 
carrying 117 pounds in a 6 1/2-furlong allowance race for fillies and mares, 
close with a rush and nip Lori's Light by a nose. Backers of the horse received 
a hefty $44.20 for a $2 win ticket. 
</P>
<P>
If you had played the system that calls for a bet on the highest-weighted 
horse, you, too, would have won. It's simple. However, if two or more horses 
tie for top weight, skip the race. 
</P>
<P>
On the day that Corvettin won, two other high weights also came in. The second 
race favorite, Jennysport, carrying 123 pounds, easily sped to victory by 3 1/2 
lengths, paying $4, and Desperate, with 119 pounds on its back, won the third 
race by 5 1/2 lengths, also paying $4. 
</P>
<P>
For bettors of the system, only five of the nine races qualified. Total returns 
would have amounted to $52.20, while bets for races would have added up to $10. 
Profit for the day would have been a neat $42.20. 
</P>
<P>
Those who wager on the high-weighted horses, of course, get an edge. Only the 
top nags are penalized. This means that the top-weighted animals should have a 
better chance than most. Since weights generally are based on races won, money 
won or both, bettors on them get the best horses. 
</P>
<P>
But no one knows for certain whether weight is more important, for instance, 
than class, the jockey, length of the race, post position, condition of the 
horse or racing luck. Many experts will tell you, however, to forget such 
factors and mostly consider the horse and how it ran in the past. 
</P>
<P>
I've always believed that weight is greatly overemphasized in analyzing form. 
Although extra weight naturally may slow a horse, horse racing generally 
doesn't work out exactly as handicappers figure it should. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if a horse has never carried 118 pounds and is suddenly assessed 
124 pounds, I don't think it's going to make any difference, no matter how long 
the race. I've seen horses carrying 122 pounds finish second or third in a race 
and then finish second or third a few days later, carrying 10 pounds less at 
the same distance. 
</P>
<P>
How would the horse know what's up? For instance, if a horse picks up five 
pounds and you ask it whether the weight is going to make a difference, the nag 
isn't about to say: "No. It'll be a piece of cake." What he's going to do is 
take the weight and make the best of it. He's certainly not going to knock the 
track secretary or his owner -- not if he wants to eat regularly. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how to bet the high weight. Consider the fifth race at Santa Anita on 
March 19, 1989. Rundown by post position and weight: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Air Worthy, 118 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Sure Swift, 116 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Nasib, 113 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Rufus Dawes, 115 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Canon Law, 113 
</P>
<P>
6 -- Individualist, 111 
</P>
<P>
7 -- Neferou, 113 
</P>
<P>
8 -- Aranjuez, 113 
</P>
<P>
9 -- Rockard, 116 
</P>
<P>
10 -- Record Turnout, 116 
</P>
<P>
11 -- Samarid, 116 
</P>
<P>
12 -- Accomplish Ridge, 116 
</P>
<P>
Air Worthy would have been the horse to bet in the 6 1/2-furlong race. As it 
turned out, Air Worthy broke slowly but came on strong in the stretch to win by 
three-quarters of a length. It paid $82.40. 
</P>
<P>
Four other horses qualified March 19, requiring a total outlay of $8. Although 
Air Worthy was the only winner for the day, profit came to a delightful $74.40. 
</P>
<P>
What might throw bettors off are the overweights. If you handicap your horses 
the night before the races, you may find when you get to the track the next day 
that your nag has picked up some weight because the jockey lived it up at the 
dinner table the night before. 
</P>
<P>
No matter, stick to your track program and study the horses and their weights. 
You shouldn't have any difficulty in choosing which pony to bet on, 
particularly after the track announcer gives everyone the corrected weights. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, high-weight betting has another big advantage. Since many experts and 
fans ignore the horses carrying the "big pounds," when one wins, prices tend to 
skyrocket.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed 
Monday after a secret trial, state television announced, as the capital that 
Ceausescu long had terrorized settled into an uneasy calm. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, Romanian television and radio broadcasts reported that 
Ceausescu was being held in an undisclosed location. His whereabouts had been 
the subject of rumor and speculation since Friday, when he fled the capital in 
the face of mass demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 9 p.m. local time (11 a.m. PST), the television, which had been 
broadcasting a symphony concert, broke into its program for an announcement 
read by a solemn man wearing a suit and the red, blue and yellow armband of the 
National Salvation Front, as the provisional government is known. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu, the announcer said, had been tried and convicted by "an 
extraordinary military court" of "particularly grave crimes against Romania," 
including "genocide, subversion of the state, theft of public assets, 
destruction of the national economy and an attempt to escape." The genocide 
charge, the announcer said, was based on an estimated 60,000 killings during 
the dictator's rule. 
</P>
<P>
"The sentence was death, and the sentence was carried out," the announcer said. 
</P>
<P>
Film shown early today on Romanian television showed the Ceausescus before 
their execution, being brought to an undisclosed location in an armored car, 
wire services reported. The film was the first of Ceausescu to be shown since 
the provisional government announced his capture Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu, dressed in a dark suit and a heavy black overcoat, looked gaunt and 
tired but smiled as a man in a white coat checked his blood pressure. His wife 
looked forlorn as she sat against a wall, dressed in a beige fur-lined coat 
with her head covered peasant-style in a scarf. The execution itself was not 
shown. 
</P>
<P>
The reported execution came as the army announced plans for a "final offensive" 
against the pro-Ceausescu security forces who have carried on guerrilla warfare 
throughout the capital and cities elsewhere in the country since the dictator's 
downfall. 
</P>
<P>
Monday was the first day since then to pass with relatively little shooting in 
Bucharest. The capital's tense atmosphere eased, if only slightly, as many 
civilians appeared to have heeded army orders to turn in weapons they had been 
using at makeshift roadblocks around the city. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Independent Television News reported from Bucharest early today that 
a dozen Ceausescu loyalists were gunned down by the army when they attacked a 
Ministry of Defense building where they believed Ceausescu was being held. It 
was not clear from the report exactly when the rescue attempt was made. 
</P>
<P>
ITN showed film of three bullet-riddled vehicles that apparently had been used 
in the raid. A body was slumped over the steering wheel of one of the vehicles, 
and two others appeared to have been burned. 
</P>
<P>
Reporting from Romanian television's Bucharest studio, ITN correspondent Paul 
Davies called the situation in the capital "very tense. . . . Everyone is 
waiting to see how those remaining supporters will react to Ceausescu's 
execution." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city's airport reopened for cargo planes, allowing medical 
supplies from several Western nations to be airlifted in. The army appears to 
have cleared the airport of agents of the Securitate, Ceausescu's secret police 
and private army, although the effort reportedly has cost scores, if not 
hundreds, of lives. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the national death toll from the fighting remained unknown. Romanian 
television early Monday broadcast the figure of 70,000 dead and more than 
300,000 injured, but then quickly retracted those numbers. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the exact number, it is already clear that the fighting has been 
the bloodiest in Europe since the civil war in Greece ended four decades ago. 
Morgues in the capital are full, and mass graves continue to be unearthed in 
the western city of Timisoara, where the revolution against Ceausescu began 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Holdouts of the Securitate security police continued to disrupt life in 
Timisoara, where gunfire punctuated Christmas all day. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting was reported particularly intense near the central Continental Hotel, 
and ITN reported a gunfight lasting several hours in a nearby construction yard 
between army troops and about 50 Ceausescu loyalists. 
</P>
<P>
"The Securitate seem capable of taking on the army just when and where they 
please," reported ITN's Colin Baker from Timisoara. 
</P>
<P>
A wounded man identified as a Securitate agent was shown, apparently 
unconscious in a hospital bed, his body held down with heavy rope netting 
intended to keep him from escaping. 
</P>
<P>
Romanian television also showed film of army tanks standing guard in the 
Transylvanian countryside, where the Securitate is considered to be 
particularly strong thanks to Ceausescu's determination to keep close tabs on 
the Hungarian minority living there. 
</P>
<P>
It also showed street fighting in Brasov, which was the site of earlier 
anti-government unrest, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
A train ride from Timisoara to Bucharest, normally a nine-hour trip, took 15 
hours. The train halted for three hours outside Bucharest because of reports of 
shooting at the train station in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The rugged Transylvanian Alps and the Danube Plain between Timisoara and 
Bucharest appeared quiet but jumpy. Citizen patrols could be seen in every 
village, stopping cars at central intersections and searching for weapons. 
There were few signs of Christmas cheer. 
</P>
<P>
As word of Ceausescu's reported execution spread through the train, the 
conductor burst into a compartment occupied by three American journalists. As 
he told about the report, he pointed at his head with his index finger and made 
a popping noise, then giggled uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>
Train stations displayed Romanian flags with gaping holes at their center, 
where the Communist emblem had been ripped from the cloth. Ceausescu slogans 
urging greater productivity and national pride had been blacked out or defaced. 
</P>
<P>
At the north station in Bucharest, people huddled in darkened waiting rooms as 
sporadic small-arms fire rattled in the distance. A sign painted on one of the 
station's billboards in crude, white letters urged citizens to "avoid 
disorder." 
</P>
<P>
Bucharest's still-functioning subway system, once the pride of the Ceausescu 
regime, was in the control of youngsters between the ages of 12 and 18. They 
wore white paper badges with their names scribbled on them. They stopped 
passengers and searched baggage and, like characters from Dickens, scurried in 
the shadows, scanning the rooftops for snipers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the situation in Bucharest had improved, the scene here was calm only 
in relative terms. Shooting in Bucharest continued until shortly before 3 a.m. 
Monday, then resumed shortly after dawn. 
</P>
<P>
And today, there could be heavy fighting once again when the army, which moved 
reinforcements into the city throughout Monday, plans to begin its last push 
against the remaining Securitate strongholds. Army officials ordered civilians 
in three neighborhoods of Bucharest to evacuate their homes to clear the way 
for the offensive. 
</P>
<P>
One of those neighborhoods surrounds the national television broadcast station, 
which has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting over the last several 
days and which continued to be the location of sporadic shooting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the central area of the city, the day remained mostly quiet, but at roughly 
7:30 p.m., the flares of tracer bullets and the sound of .50-caliber 
machine-gun fire split the night air as a brief but intense barrage broke out 
near the downtown Plaza of the Republic. The plaza is the site of Romania's 
former Communist Party headquarters, now being used as the army command post. 
The area is widely believed to be honeycombed with tunnels that Securitate 
agents reportedly have used as ammunition dumps and hideaways. 
</P>
<P>
Two more embassies evacuated dependents during the day, with the Soviets 
sending out more than 100 of their citizens and the British evacuating 21 
people who had spent Christmas Eve as refugees in the heavily guarded U.S. 
Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the army now appeared to have clearly established its reign throughout 
the city. And across the country, from Jasi near the Soviet border to 
Timisoara, pro-Ceausescu forces were surrendering to the army, according to 
Romanian radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the National Salvation Front felt secure enough Monday to begin 
organizing the provisional government that will start the arduous task of 
rebuilding a nation that has been economically and spiritually devastated by 
one of the world's last remaining totalitarian regimes. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the basic elements of a new political order have been coalescing in 
the form of new newspapers and neighborhood committees that have established 
checkpoints across the city. 
</P>
<P>
The newspapers -- Free Romania, Free Youth and Spark of the People -- were 
spread throughout the city by a unique distribution system in which men tossed 
piles of newspapers off the backs of trucks as they drove down major 
boulevards. Crowds ran eagerly into the street to pick up copies. 
</P>
<P>
The papers carried communiques from the National Salvation Front, articles 
exhorting the population to remain disciplined and vigilant and messages 
praising the progress of the national revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The committees, meanwhile, loosely organized into networks in each of 
Bucharest's eight districts, have been charged with maintaining security in the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
In major factories across the city, workers have formed organizations that 
dispatch men and women to staff checkpoints and barricades to search for 
weapons and Securitate agents. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to find the terrorists who are in possession of arms," said 
55-year-old Petr Purcea, an inspector from the government's energy department, 
who is in charge of checkpoints near the television station. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a vacuum of political power," added another man staffing one of the 
barricades. "The army and the political committees are managing the situation 
for the moment." 
</P>

AIDS AND THE ARTS: BEHIND THE SCENES OF A TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quietly at first and then not so quietly, it became clear that the epidemic of 
AIDS was stalking America's artistic community in the second half of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
An infectious disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome took the lives of 
thousands of artists and entertainers, spurred others to respond with works 
addressing the epidemic, politicized art exhibitions and grant proposals, and 
made the 1980s seem like wartime. 
</P>
<P>
More than a few artists and arts leaders, particularly in the dance world, were 
reluctant to acknowledge the effect of AIDS since the disease initially struck 
hardest at gay men and intravenous drug users, groups already stigmatized by 
society at large. But it was hard to ignore the death toll, whatever its 
sociological implications. A disproportionate number of AIDS victims, it turned 
out, were poor and anonymous, but there were also a lot who acted, painted, 
sang, danced and in one way or another contributed to the public creative life 
of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"The impact was throughout the whole society, but we were so visible," said 
actress Colleen Dewhurst, president of Actors' Equity, the stage actors' union 
that raised $750,000 through benefits and donations to distribute to 600 of its 
members living with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"One tends to morbidly look at the obituary page more and more," said Gordon 
Davidson, artistic director of the Mark Taper Forum, one of Los Angeles' 
leading resident theaters. "And the feeling is that when no one is there, you 
say, 'We got through another day.' " 
</P>
<P>
The immediate toll at the Taper among staff and performers was relatively small 
compared to New York's experimental off-off-Broadway theater company La Mama, 
which estimated in November that 53 people who had been associated with it had 
died of AIDS. As a result, the nonprofit theater's insurance rates went up 
400%. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost curators, exhibition designers, conservators, registrars. I don't 
think there's an aspect of museum work that hasn't been affected by AIDS," said 
Harry Parker III, director of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. "My guess 
would be that nationwide, 100 museum professionals have died of AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Assessing the effect of AIDS on the arts, documentary film maker Robert 
Epstein, who directed the Oscar-winning 1985 documentary "The Times of Harvey 
Milk" and produced the recent AIDS documentary "Common Threads" for HBO, said: 
"I think because so many artists have fallen to AIDS and will continue to do 
so, the impact is going to be felt more strongly in the long term than the 
short term. It's an intangible that we can't even evaluate, but that we have to 
keep in perspective -- that we have lost so many talented people in their 
prime." 
</P>
<P>
AIDS was not always listed as the official cause of death, but a generation of 
choreographers -- from Michael Bennett to Arnie Zane -- seemed to be dying off 
at the peak of their creative powers. 
</P>
<P>
Award-winning New York dancer and choreographer Bill T. Jones, who was Zane's 
lover and collaborator and who lost an additional "35 to 40 friends" during the 
decade, responded to the reticence of some dance professionals to identify AIDS 
as a cause of death: "I am saddened that these men whom I respect could not 
have an organizational consciousness that would have made room for allowing 
themselves to become part of a tragic moment in history. They keep themselves 
apart, and don't help us see how many brilliant leaders have been taken from 
us." 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, the death of Rock Hudson from AIDS in 1985 was just the 
beginning. Subsequent AIDS-related deaths in the movie and television 
industries ranged in estimates from 200 to 1,000, with precise figures hard to 
come by because of the continuing stigma attached to the disease. A comparative 
study made by Fox Entertainment News (KTTV-TV Channel 11) in conjunction with 
an entertainment-industry task force suggested that the incidence of AIDS in 
Hollywood was three times the national average for other industries. 
</P>
<P>
During the initial panic, when it was believed falsely that the virus could be 
transmitted through saliva, a number of actresses said they would not do 
kissing scenes with actors they believed to be gay. More significantly, the 
incidence of AIDS in Hollywood threatened the jobs and health benefits of some 
studio employees diagnosed as carrying the virus, as studio executives 
contended with rising insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
While the entertainment industry publicly lamented the crisis and raised 
millions of dollars through highly visible, star-studded benefits, behind the 
scenes some members of the Hollywood community worried that it was mostly for 
show. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has only fostered homophobia in the entertainment business," said 
television writer and playwright Joel Kimmell. "To this community, 
homosexuality equals AIDS, and AIDS equals homosexuality." 
</P>
<P>
The worlds of classical music and opera were also affected. The worst hit was 
the New York City Opera, where general director Beverly Sills observed in June, 
1987, that the company had lost two dozen members, including singers, musicians 
and staff. 
</P>
<P>
The Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles calculated it had lost 29 singers to AIDS 
(out of 150) between 1984 and 1989, which led to the making of a documentary 
film about the group, "No One Is Alone." 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly on everyone's mind," said Michael Morgan, assistant conductor 
of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, "but it hits the major orchestras a little 
less hard because the players are a little bit older and tend not to be in the 
high-risk groups. The biggest impact it's had on music generally is that all of 
us have grown accustomed to reading of the deaths of our younger colleagues, 
which has made the whole community sadder, but also hardened some of the 
feelings because now you're almost not even surprised when someone dies." 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the 1980s, the AIDS obituary list in the arts included theater 
directors John Hirsch, Wilfred Leach and Charles Ludlam, who was also an actor; 
actors Seth Allen, Neil Flanagan and Amanda Blake; opera director David Hicks; 
Robert Jacobson, editor of Opera News; screenwriter-director Colin Higgins; 
classical pianist Paul Jacobs; entertainer Liberace; theater composer Bill 
Elliot; photographer Robert Mapplethorpe; painters Carlos Almaraz, Jay Phillips 
and Don Sorenson; dancer Charles Ward, and art dealer Nicholas Wilder. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, artists turned their energies and imaginations to address the 
epidemic, not only through an array of fund-raising benefits, but through art 
itself, from Cyndi Lauper's song "Little Boy Blue" to Larry Kramer's hit stage 
play "The Normal Heart," to macabre and powerful exhibitions of paintings and 
photographs depicting AIDS victims. 
</P>
<P>
Novels about AIDS included "The Valley of the Shadow," by Christopher Davis and 
"86ed" by David Feinberg, but the first literature spawned by the plague was 
more often in the form of memoirs, led by Larry Kramer's "Reports from the 
holocaust" and "Borrowed Time," by Los Angeles poet and novelist Paul Monette, 
who also contributed the AIDS-related poetry collection, "Love Alone." San 
Francisco journalist Randy Shilts wrote a critically acclaimed, best-selling 
history of the epidemic, "And the Band Played On." 
</P>
<P>
There was a direct, head-on confrontation with the subject in photography, 
where Nicholas Nixon and Ann Meredith, among others, captured memorable 
portraits of the suffering brought on by AIDS. "I think unquestionably that 
some of this work will endure," said San Francisco photography gallery owner 
Jeffrey Fraenkel, whose exhibition of Nixon's photographs was later seen in a 
variation at New York's Museum of Modern Art. "The best of it ends up being, 
like AIDS itself, more about life than about death. That was certainly true of 
Nixon's work." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that everyone who's in the midst of it just has a different sense of 
what their life span is now," said Deborah Hoffman, an Oakland-based film 
editor who edited "The Times of Harvey Milk" and "Common Threads." 
"Everything's kind of moved along a little faster than we expected." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Miller, a Los Angeles performance artist, AIDS activist and author of the 
piece "Sex/Love/AIDS," saw the crisis as a way to refocus art in a positive 
way. "It's reconnecting art to the world and to the reality of pain and death 
and love, which is probably the proper terrain of the artist anyway," Miller 
said. "I think it has deeply changed the criteria for how art is going to be 
judged. Like, is it effective? Can it change the reality that creates pain in 
the world? This is to me a greater criterion for work than whether the color 
field is of interest." 
</P>
<P>
Miller was one of a group of artists who blockaded the Federal Building in Los 
Angeles in October as part of a national protest of the federal Food and Drug 
Administration's slow response to AIDS. Elsewhere, AIDS activists, unsatisfied 
with artworks that were primarily elegiac, began advocating a more 
confrontational aesthetic. Members of the group Act Up (AIDS Coalition to 
Unleash Power) disrupted the opening night of the San Francisco Opera this year 
by running down the aisles of the opera house blowing whistles. 
</P>
<P>
Across the country in early December, scores of museums closed for a day, 
observing "A Day Without Art," designed to recognize AIDS deaths among visual 
artists. At the Dallas Museum of Art, special programs director Melissa Berry 
helped put up a temporary wall in front of the museum's entrance bearing the 
names of 200 northern Texas artists dead from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"I see artists more so than ever taking their roles as artists more seriously," 
Berry said, "and through their art trying to bring the crisis to the attention 
of the public -- not only in Dallas but everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The theater responded to AIDS relatively early, with the 1985 staging in New 
York and Los Angeles of "The Normal Heart," a consciousness-raising drama about 
the failure of New York City's government and press and many gay men to take 
the epidemic seriously. The same year brought William Hoffman's Tony 
Award-nominated "As Is," a sad-funny piece that ended on the up-notes of 
Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" from the Ninth Symphony. An adaptation of the play was 
commissioned by PBS, which ultimately decided the language was too tough for 
its stations in the South and passed it off to cable.

Subsequently, Harvey Fierstein's three one-acts, "Safe Sex," were produced on 
Broadway; in Robert Chesley's "Jerker," two men stood on opposite sides of the 
stage and had sex by phone. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood, in contrast, steered clear of the subject, at least directly, on the 
big screen while working references to AIDS into the story lines of television 
shows like "St. Elsewhere" and "Trapper John," and commissioning one TV movie, 
"An Early Frost" (NBC), about a young man (played by Aidan Quinn) with AIDS 
hoping to win back the love of a disapproving father (Ben Gazzara). 
</P>
<P>
The networks chose to ignore the statistical realities of the disease, 
preferring plots that presented hemophiliacs and children as innocent victims 
who contracted AIDS through blood transfusions (in fact, a relatively rare 
occurrence). Gay activists directed charges of fear-mongering at the NBC series 
"Midnight Caller" for presenting a bisexual man as a murderer who planned to 
spread the virus to unsuspecting women partners. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood films did make concessions to the epidemic. By the time the 1985 Los 
Angeles-originated play "Casual Sex" had been transformed into a Universal 
movie in 1988, the title had become "Casual Sex?" Likewise, in the 1987 
Universal comedy "Dragnet," Tom Hanks made it clear he wouldn't have sex 
without a condom; in the James Bond film "The Living Daylights" (United 
Artists), Bond suddenly confined his amorous attentions to one woman instead of 
bedding the usual three or four.

Film critic and historian Vito Russo, author of "The Celluloid Closet: A 
History of Homosexuality in the Movies," observed changes wrought by AIDS in 
Hollywood: "One would say that Hollywood's alleged sense of moral values has 
altered in response to the AIDS crisis. Films like 'Fatal Attraction' and 
'Someone to Watch Over Me' are metaphors for AIDS, about the dangers of 
promiscuity, about a return to family values, responses to the existence of 
AIDS. 'Fatal Attraction' is a sort of AIDS horror movie, what can happen if you 
cheat on your wife once." 
</P>
<P>
"As Is" playwright Hoffman, who was later hired by Warner Bros. to write an 
AIDS movie, explained that the film would center on a black woman who gets the 
disease, which was one way he believed the subject could be deemed acceptable 
for a Hollywood feature. "The largest number of people with AIDS are gay men," 
Hoffman told a writers' symposium in Los Angeles, "and studio executives have a 
hatred and fear of gay men and find them unacceptable as characters." 
</P>
<P>
Kramer, author of "The Normal Heart" and a former Hollywood executive, also 
took the movie industry to task for avoiding the topic: "I remember in the 
Second World War when F.D.R. had a crisis and wanted the world to be educated 
about it, he called up the head of a movie studio like Jack Warner and said, 
'Make a movie about it.' And he would. And he didn't expect to make a lot of 
money on it but saw it as an educational tool." 
</P>
<P>
Kramer was also critical of his fellow writers. "Artists have not done their 
share on this one. It's that simple. None of the best gay writers has written 
about AIDS. In my estimation, they've ducked the issue." 
</P>
<P>
Besides spreading despair and "the silent fear when people are dropping around 
you," as La Mama executive director Wickham Boyle put it, AIDS seemed to 
further politicize the arts, which carried a potential negative economic impact 
as well at a time when publicly funded arts groups were already under attack by 
conservative forces in government. With cultural institutions and performers' 
unions facing higher insurance premiums brought on by expensive care needed to 
treat the disease, many of the same nonprofit institutions also began to worry 
about a backlash from funding organizations. Such organizations, they believed, 
were uncomfortable with the link between AIDS and homosexuality and wary of 
AIDS activism in the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Most conspicuously, the new chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, 
John Frohnmayer, in November suspended a $10,000 federal grant approved by the 
endowment last May as part of the sponsorship of a Manhattan gallery exhibition 
of paintings, photographs and sculptures aimed at depicting the emotions felt 
by AIDS patients. The chairman's explanation was that the show's catalogue 
contained derogatory references to political and religious figures -- among 
them, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who led the campaign in Congress earlier in 
the year against the public funding of art he viewed to be obscene. 
</P>
<P>
The executive director of one New York dance company, who asked not to be 
identified, pointed to the endowment controversy and said, "That's why people 
in dance are being so quiet about AIDS. We're all worried about our funding." 
</P>
<P>
Others like Tim Miller saw the rising political stakes as evidence that the 
arts were entering a fresh era of excitement, reminiscent of the late 1960s, 
when art took to the barricades of American culture, infused with the energy of 
various liberation movements and protest against the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not unlike the generation of assassinations we lived through," said 
Gordon Davidson, recalling the 1960s in a different context. "John Kennedy and 
Martin Luther King, Bobby Kennedy, Malcolm X. You can't eliminate that many 
leaders from the world without paying a tremendous price, because talent 
doesn't come along in equal doses." 
</P>
<P>
In the land of MTV and cosmetic surgery, AIDS brought a rude awakening, which 
dancer Bill T. Jones chose to compare to the wave of tuberculosis that swept 
Europe in the 1830s. "The early Romantics were concerned with some of the 
topics that we're concerned with now," Jones said. "There was a preoccupation 
in the arts community with early death, and also a connection between sex and 
death." 
</P>
<P>
To cope with his "overwhelming sense of loss," Jones devised a recent dance 
work, "Absence," on a Berlioz song cycle, "Nuits d'Ete," written during the 
same tuberculosis epidemic that informed Puccini's operatic tale of tragedy 
among young artists in Paris, "La Boheme." 
</P>
<P>
"There's an uncanny parallel to our own era. Young people who before had no 
notion of death now deal with mortality every day. Not just those of us in the 
gay community, but in general I think we've been forced to look at the issue of 
mortality, and it's reflected in the work that's being done. We are not 
superhuman. Some of us are going to die very soon."
