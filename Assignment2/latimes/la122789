JAZZ NOTES: COLLEAGUES LAUD DEEJAY JIM GOSA, DEAD AT 58; FATHER TOM VAUGHN 
SCHEDULED AT MONTELEONE'S 
</P>

The Los Angeles jazz community lost a very good friend when Jim Gosa -- a 
veteran broadcaster who worked at such stations as KFOX, KBIG and KKGO during 
his four-decade career -- died Dec. 18 of melanoma at age 58. 
</P>
<P>
Though a sometime film, television and stage actor who appeared in such films 
as "High Plains Drifter" with Clint Eastwood and episodes of "Hawaii Five-O," 
the deep-voiced Gosa was best known as a jazz disc jockey for KKGO-FM, where he 
worked for 21 years. His completely personal way of integrating contemporary 
and mainstream jazz, both instrumental and vocal, into unified, flowing sets 
gained legions of fans. These fans ardently followed his programs until the end 
of August, when his illness forced him to leave the air permanently. 
</P>
<P>
An intelligent man with a blindingly fast wit, Gosa was a tireless worker. For 
many years he not only handled his own three- to four-hour, six-day-a-week air 
shift at KKGO (formerly KBCA-FM), he also was in charge of the station's 
commercial production schedule and produced many of the commercials himself. As 
if that weren't enough, Gosa began studying law at night in 1982, eventually 
passing the California State Bar last June. 
</P>
<P>
Here are remembrances of Jim Gosa by four friends and associates who knew him 
well: 
</P>
<P>
"He was the absolute best at his business, a first class professional guy," 
said Chuck Niles, the renowned disc jockey who worked alongside Gosa at 
KBCA/KKGO. "Everything he did was perfect. I can't ever remember him goofing. 
And as an interviewer, he did that as well as anyone." 
</P>
<P>
"I loved him so very much because he had such great taste in music," said 
singer Carmen McRae. "He was very good to me, for which I'm completely 
grateful. Every time I saw him, he made me feel good, like when he'd come into 
the club and talk for a second. He was such a decent human being, a sweet 
person and I'm going to miss him like hell." 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, he was the samurai of the jocks. If he had a sword in his hand, he'd make 
it swing," said actor Pat Morita, who, as a stand-up comedian, worked the jazz 
circuit in the '50s and '60s. "I was an enormous admirer of his work and his 
sound and his presence, and I was very fortunate to have been able to count Jim 
in my personal little circle of friends. He was a one of a kind." 
</P>
<P>
"To all of us, Jim has given more than he has taken. Let his memory be our 
lesson," said Dennis Smith, who worked with Gosa at KBIG in the mid-'60s and at 
KBCA/KKGO from 1970-78. 
</P>
<P>
There are unfinalized plans for a memorial concert. Scholarships in Gosa's name 
are being established at the Berklee College of Music and through the 
International Assn. of Jazz Educators. Donations may be sent to Jim Gosa 
Memorial Fund, in care of KKGO-FM, P.O. Box 250028, Los Angeles 90025. 
</P>
<P>
Palm Springs Jazz, a three-day extravaganza, is scheduled at the Wyndham Palm 
Springs resort Friday through Sunday. Among the artists on tap: singers Pia 
Beck, Yve Evans and Cheryl Stephens; Conrad Janis and the Beverly Hills 
Unlisted Jazz Band; Finland's Oiling Boiling Blues Band, and the Nightblooming 
Jazzmen. Music starts at 2:30 p.m. Friday. Information (800) 346-7308. 
</P>
<P>
Father Tom Vaughn, former Episcopal clergyman at St. Martin-in-the-Fields in 
the San Fernando Valley, is in the midst of his first Los Angeles club 
engagement in more than a year, playing Wednesdays through Jan. 10 at 
Monteleone's in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to get out of my self-imposed shell and get back to work," said 
Vaughn, who has recorded LPs for the RCA and Concord Jazz labels. "I really 
like Monteleone's. It's small with a good piano. I've kind of been working on 
the classics lately, like Bach's 'French Suites' and a lot of Chopin, kind of 
been in the (wood)shed, so my chops are up." Vaughn, who will work with bassist 
Ernie McDaniel and drummer Jack Sperling, said his repertoire will consist 
mostly of standards.

ManWatchers on the Prowl: For the first time, the women's group ManWatchers 
Inc. voted three females -- actress Michele Pfeiffer, First Lady Barbara Bush 
and "Today" co-host Jane Pauley -- to their list of the 10 Most Watchable 
People of 1989. Why? Because, said president Suzy Mallery, "looks are much less 
important than they used to be; accomplishment, creativity, kindness and 
manners count much more." Still, the group knows a hunk when it sees one. Actor 
Kevin Costner was called "the man for the '90s," because he is "natural, 
comfortably masculine and sexy." Costner was named to the list along with Mel 
Gibson, Arsenio Hall, Jack Nicholson, Magic Johnson, Ted Koppel and Morgan 
Freeman. Claudia Puig

That's Italian: A low-budget TV show where men and women throw off their 
clothes to win prizes is gaining popularity in Italy, despite condemnation by 
critics, and might be coming to America. On the "Hit It Big" (Colpo Grosso) 
game show, contestants strip down to their underwear, accumulating points as 
they peel off layers of clothing to the rhythm of pop music. When the show 
first aired three years ago, it was criticized by the Roman Catholic Church, 
the press and politicians. But producer Umberto Smaila has sold the show in 
Germany and says he is negotiating with American cable television. "Italians 
have shown they're very mature. Beyond seeing it as just about naked breasts 
and bottoms, they've understood it's just fun, like the Paris Lido," Smaila 
said. Claudia Puig

Historic Movie House May Close: The Texas Theater, the Dallas movie house where 
Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested after the assassination of President John F. 
Kennedy, may be closing soon. The 60-year-old theater was built by Howard 
Hughes but its current owner, United Artists, wants to shut it down because 
it's losing money. The Texas Theater Historical Assn. is trying to declare the 
theater a historical landmark and has asked director Oliver Stone to consider 
allowing a special screening at the theater of his new film, "Born on the 
Fourth of July," which was filmed in the same neighborhood. Claudia Puig

ARCO KEEPING CAP ON NEW UNLEADED FUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No matter where you went this past September, it seemed impossible to escape 
actor James Earl Jones' mellifluous baritone extolling the virtues of Atlantic 
Richfield Co.'s new lower-emission unleaded gasoline, called EC-1. 
</P>
<P>
In advertisements that saturated radio, television, print media and even bus 
panels, Arco spent $10 million in only five weeks to make sure that the message 
got across: It had produced the first commercially marketed gasoline formulated 
specifically to help reduce smog. 
</P>
<P>
That campaign made Emission Control-1 gasoline one of the most heavily touted 
new products ever introduced in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
What is odd is that most of the people who heard or saw those ads cannot even 
buy the gasoline. Arco chose to market EC-1 as a replacement for its leaded 
regular gas, aimed only at owners of older cars and trucks -- those without 
catalytic converters -- which account for only one out of every five gallons of 
gasoline bought in the regional market. 
</P>
<P>
And, to make sure that the new fuel is bought only for the older vehicles, Arco 
put it in pumps with large nozzles that do not fit new cars. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, sales of the new gasoline have not broken any records. 
</P>
<P>
It is not that newer cars cannot use EC-1. Arco has not publicized the fact, 
but new cars can use EC-1 just as easily as the old ones do, with emissions 
reductions that are measurable, though not as dramatic as those from older 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Critics and Arco competitors have suggested that Arco has restricted the 
marketing of EC-1 because it does not wish to steal market share from its own 
higher-emission regular unleaded gasoline, which accounts for the majority of 
Arco's gasoline sales. 
</P>
<P>
Arco denies that, and the company and its supporters -- including regulators 
who applaud Arco for pioneering lower-emissions gasoline -- argue that the 
marketing decision was made simply because Arco cannot make enough EC-1 to go 
around. Because of that, they said, Arco chose to market EC-1 where it could do 
the most good: to vehicles that cause a disproportionate amount of Southern 
California smog. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the curious marketing plan for EC-1 suggests that Arco really 
wanted to win public relations goodwill and to set an example, not to increase 
sales. And if one accepts Arco's explanation of its marketing decision, the 
matter also reveals the limited ability of the current refining system to meet 
the demand for new, lower-emissions gasolines without substantial investment 
and years of upgrading. 
</P>
<P>
"It will cost the industry billions to make changes to make sufficient 
quantities of this stuff," said George H. Babikian, president of Arco Products 
Co., Arco's refining and marketing subsidiary. The next generation of EC 
gasolines, designed specifically for newer cars, is being tested at 
laboratories in Texas but will not be ready for at least two years. Refinery 
changes will take another three to four years, he added. 
</P>
<P>
EC-1's unveiling in Los Angeles County at a well-attended news conference in 
late August drew national attention, and local and state officials backed 
Arco's claims that EC-1 could result in dramatic air quality improvements if 
all vehicles that use leaded regular were to convert to EC-1. 
</P>
<P>
As the debate intensified about what is the best fuel to meet proposed clean 
air standards, EC-1 was hailed as an innovation that would focus talk around 
reformulated gasoline as a viable alternative to methanol, ethanol and 
compressed natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
But sales of EC-1 have not set records. The gasoline went on sale Sept. 1 as a 
replacement for Arco's leaded regular in Southern California -- and the 
company's share of the leaded gasoline market promptly dropped. 
</P>
<P>
It has rebounded in subsequent months, though, and Arco's share of the leaded 
gasoline market has grown 3% to 5% per month, even though the total leaded 
market continues to decline. 
</P>
<P>
The company now sells about 22,000 to 23,000 barrels of the gasoline per day, 
or about a third of the leaded gasoline market in Southern California, Babikian 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And that may be just fine for the company. EC-1 is made solely at Arco's Carson 
refinery, which has a capacity of only 26,000 to 27,000 barrels of EC-1 a day, 
Babikian said. 
</P>
<P>
When introducing EC-1, Arco was careful to say that it would soon come out with 
versions of the gasoline for newer cars as well. But it kept quiet about the 
fact that EC-1 is a perfectly adequate fuel for new cars. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, EC-1 is superior to regular unleaded in a number of ways: It has a 
higher octane rating, is cleaner burning and -- most important -- is cheaper to 
buy at retail. 
</P>
<P>
"If they have the capability to make it but are only selling it to the lowest 
volume users and making it impossible for others to use, then where is their 
air pollution concern?" asked Judy Roberson, secretary of the National AM/PM 
Coalition, an association of Arco franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
Arco sells both EC-1 and its regular unleaded gasoline to dealers for the same 
price. Dealers are motivated to hold the price for EC-1 at a lower level, 
Roberson said, partly to retain the former leaded gasoline customers and partly 
as a loss leader to bring new customers into the stations. 
</P>
<P>
Still, regular unleaded may retail for as much as 5 cents per gallon more than 
EC-1. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists who figure this out could conceivably use a funnel to overcome the 
larger nozzle. So far, state and local officials and dealers doubt that this is 
occurring. Curiously, they were not sure whether using a funnel to pump EC-1 
into a newer car would violate any laws. 
</P>
<P>
Tampering with the nozzle restricting device in a car's fuel pipe would violate 
the law, as would misusing or circumventing the vapor recovery system on a pump 
nozzle. 
</P>
<P>
But simply using a funnel to pump unleaded gas such as EC-1 into a car with a 
catalytic converter? "It would not be a violation of federal regulations," said 
Barry Nussbaum, acting director of the field operations division of the 
Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, it is unlikely that a dealer would stand for such fueling 
practices, since dealers can be fined for allowing misfueling. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Arco says it is swallowing the cost of making EC-1 so that it can 
be priced competitively. EC-1 costs 1 or 2 cents a gallon more to make than 
regular leaded gasoline, Babikian said. 
</P>
<P>
If Arco were to open up sales of EC-1, it could probably be priced as high as 
unleaded regular. "They are obviously eating a higher production cost," said 
one observer. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason we have limited it to (leaded regular customers) is that we can 
only make a certain amount of it, and for us to come out with EC-1 and have 
sales increases we couldn't satisfy, . . . we'd have to raise the price or 
ration it, and that would defeat the purpose," Babikian said. 
</P>
<P>
Arco argues that it would have to make costly improvements to its refinery to 
satisfy a huge demand. 
</P>
<P>
The current batches of EC-1 are made by removing certain chemicals from the 
fuel and placing them in other grades of gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to note that with EC-1, nothing really went away," said James 
Kulakowski, a refining planning engineer with Unocal Corp., an Arco competitor. 
"They changed the way they blended their gasoline, but what's not in EC-1 is 
now in some other grade of gasoline." 
</P>
<P>
To make EC-1, Arco made changes that could serve as models for other 
reformulated gasolines: 
</P>
<P>
* Reid Vapor Pressure, a measure of how easily gasoline evaporates, was lowered 
to 8 pounds per square inch from the current state standard of 9 psi. That was 
accomplished mainly by removing butane. 
</P>
<P>
* Benzene, a carcinogenic chemical that also contributes to smog formation, was 
reduced to 1% from the industry standard of 2%. 
</P>
<P>
* Aromatics and olefins, heavy chemicals that react with sunlight to create 
smog when they pass through an engine unburned, were reduced by up to 
one-third. 
</P>
<P>
"The key criterion for the industry is cost," said David Hawkins, a senior 
attorney with the environmentalist Natural Resources Defense Council in 
Washington, which has lobbied Congress on clean air issues. "There are a 
certain number of chemicals in a barrel of crude oil, and you want to use all 
of them. What doesn't end up in gasoline ends up in some other product they may 
want to sell or distribute." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the result could be a net reduction in emissions. An aromatic that 
goes into a car with a catalytic converter is less likely to end up as smog 
than the same chemical in leaded gasoline that passes through a car without a 
catalytic converter. 
</P>
<P>
To make more EC-1 than it does now, Arco would have to remove more chemicals 
than it can currently redirect, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
That would mean a net reduction in any chemical from the entire gasoline pool 
and would require a change in the refining process or an investment in new 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Arco is looking ahead to such changes in anticipation of increased production 
of EC-1-type gasolines, Babikian said. At the Carson refinery, a new unit to 
process gasoline components has just been finished and another new unit is 
under construction to make methyl tertiary butyl ether, a key component of 
EC-1. They will cost a total of about $75 million, Babikian said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Arco Products is asking its corporate parent for more than $1 
billion in the next five years to upgrade refineries to make reformulated 
gasoline. The problem is that tests are under way to devise the exact 
formulations of later-generation EC gasolines more suited to newer cars than 
EC-1. 
</P>
<P>
And final modifications to refineries may depend on eventual state and federal 
clean air rules. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the actual sales effects of EC-1, officials laud Arco for bringing it 
out. "What Arco has done, I think, is a really good thing," said Richard D. 
Wilson, who oversees vehicle emissions for the Environmental Protection Agency. 
"I think everyone agrees its just the first step along the path."

SEC NAMES ENFORCEMENT CHIEF, CREATES NEW UNIT; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: THE AGENCY WILL EXPAND ITS FOCUS. IT WILL NOW GO AFTER FINANCIAL 
INSTITUTIONS THAT BILK INVESTORS.

<P>
The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission named a senior agency 
lawyer as its new enforcement chief Tuesday and announced the creation of a new 
unit to investigate stock sales by savings and loans and their parent 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
In appointing William G. McLucas to the second-most powerful post at the 
regulatory agency, SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden praised him as the 
enforcement chief for the "decade of the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
Breeden left no doubt that the first priority for the new chief will be 
attacking stock fraud by financial institutions that bilk investors, a sharp 
expansion of the agency's normal concentration on Wall Street. He said the new 
unit would target financial fraud at savings and loans and banks. 
</P>
<P>
While Breeden did not mention specific cases, the SEC is investigating the sale 
of $200 million worth of junk bonds to 22,000 investors by American Continental 
Corp. through its Irvine-based thrift, Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, McLucas said the new unit will start out with a staff of 25 
and be expanded if the initial inquiries indicate a greater need. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a number of situations that we are concerned about and we are trying 
to identify the problems," McLucas said. "We intend to focus on the generic 
area of financial institutions -- thrifts and banks." 
</P>
<P>
He said investigators will concentrate on situations in which financial 
institution holding companies sell stock directly to investors through their 
branches without using underwriters to examine the deals for soundness and 
legality. That method was used by American Continental to market its bonds. 
Many investors have said they thought the bonds, now basically worthless, were 
federally insured investments. 
</P>
<P>
In congressional testimony last month, Breeden was sharply critical of the way 
thrift regulators handled the Lincoln Savings case, particularly the sale of 
bonds through Lincoln's branches. However, the thrift regulators in turn 
criticized the SEC for not moving to stop the bond sale. 
</P>
<P>
Before Breeden took the SEC helm in August, he was the chief White House 
architect of the rescue plan for the savings and loan industry, so he got a 
first-hand view of the problems there. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission's mandate to protect investors remains an essential element in 
preserving the integrity and efficiency of America's capital markets," Breeden 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
McLucas stressed that the commission will be "doing something to restore the 
confidence of the small investor and to make sure that confidence is retained 
in the market." 
</P>
<P>
Along with fraud at financial institutions, McLucas said he wants to increase 
the scrutiny of brokerage houses and the practice of account "churning," in 
which brokers earn excessive commissions by trading customers' holdings more 
often than necessary. 
</P>
<P>
McLucas, 39, has been one of three associate directors running the enforcement 
division since director Gary Lynch resigned last summer to go into private law 
practice. All three were top candidates for the post. The others, John Sturc 
and Joseph Goldstein, were also praised by Breeden. 
</P>
<P>
SEC insiders said McLucas got the nod because he had demonstrated strong 
management skills. He was given high marks for a four-month stint when he 
rescued the high-profile New York regional office from turmoil after its 
administrator left. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill has superb management skills, and he is well liked by the people who 
report to him," said Lynch, now in private practice in New York. "He has got 
the ability to organize and motivate a large staff." 
</P>
<P>
McLucas has been an enforcement attorney at the commission since 1977 and 
handled numerous high-profile cases. Among them were the conviction of Singer 
Co. Chairman Paul A. Bilzerian on securities and tax fraud charges and the 
guilty plea to securities violations of former Los Angeles brokerage executive 
Boyd L. Jefferies.

FREEZES IN FLORIDA, TEXAS LIKELY TO GIVE CONSUMERS A CHILL

The South's rare white Christmas weekend, which brought subfreezing 
temperatures all along the Gulf Coast, will be felt by consumers across the 
country in the form of higher food prices early next year, farm experts 
predicted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The cold snap devastated the citrus crop in Florida and Texas, destroyed 
budding strawberries and wiped out whole fields of winter vegetables destined 
for East Coast supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
The freeze also created strong demand for fuel at the same time the cold 
weather shut down refineries and froze natural gas wells in the Gulf of Mexico, 
resulting in prices that shot up by record amounts. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Florida's major industry -- tourism -- scarcely missed a 
beat, at least once jet liners were able to drop off vacationers at airports 
unequipped for snow removal. 
</P>
<P>
Crop Damage 
</P>
<P>
Along with higher food prices for shoppers early in the new year, there was 
fear, too, that the cold snap may have a more lasting effect on growers in both 
Texas and Florida, many of whom were hard hit by two other crop-destroying 
freezes in the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of freeze that puts people out of business," observed Freddy 
Strano, who grows 2,000 acres of tomatoes near the Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
In Texas, state agriculture officials estimated that 70% of the citrus crop and 
80% of the winter vegetable crops were destroyed when temperatures plunged into 
the low 20s and upper teens Saturday and Sunday. Florida wrote off 40% of its 
$1.4-billion citrus crop, which fuels a juice industry that normally generates 
$3.5 billion a year for the state's economy. 
</P>
<P>
One immediate result was to delay the start of trading in orange juice futures 
at the New York Cotton Exchange, where the contracts are bought and sold. 
Trading limits were imposed, but Bill O'Neill, director of research for Elders 
Futures, said it was "impossible to tell" how high prices might soar. The most 
active January contract closed 16.10 cents a pound higher at 153.10 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Also hard hit were unprotected fields of tomatoes, strawberries, eggplants, 
green peppers, sweet corn, lettuce and cucumbers, destined mainly for markets 
east of the Mississippi River. Major damage was reported to avocado, lime and 
mango crops. Florida horticulturists also reported heavy losses of ferns, which 
will mean a shortage of traditional greenery to accompany bouquets of roses 
next Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
The freeze will impose a six-week delay in the flow of fresh strawberries to 
market that was to begin in January. Production gaps of varying length for the 
other crops will show up in supermarkets until replantings are ready for 
harvest in spring. 
</P>
<P>
For citrus growers in both states, however, the true measure of the loss will 
not occur until next month when they will know whether their trees survived. 
Many hoped that colder-than-normal weather earlier had prepared the groves to 
withstand the below-freezing temperatures that left much of the South with its 
first white Christmas in decades. 
</P>
<P>
"If the freeze damages just the oranges, there is a real chance to recover and 
produce another crop next year," said Rick Bush, spokesman for the Florida Farm 
Bureau Federation. But previous freezes in 1983 and 1985 killed whole groves of 
orange and grapefruit trees, and some growers moved from central Florida 
farther south where their new groves were only now reaching full production. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's warming spelled more bad news, since ice-laced oranges can still be 
made into juice concentrate if they can be harvested before they rot. "Now we 
prefer that the temperature stay in the 40s and 50s for a month to allow us to 
get the fruit off the trees," Bush said. "The longer it stays cool, the more 
that can be processed." 
</P>
<P>
Fruit growers in both Florida and Texas' Rio Grande Valley said temperatures 
appear to be rising too fast to salvage much. The fresh-fruit market, which 
offers growers the best prices for their crop, is a total loss, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Loss of winter fruits and vegetables from Florida and Texas will also cause 
some brief gaps in availability of fresh produce in the West, predicted Jan 
DeLyer of the Fresh Produce Council in Los Angeles. Eastern crops allow markets 
to maintain supplies until Mexico reaches peak production in mid-January, 
followed a few weeks later by California. 
</P>
<P>
But reduced supplies from Florida and Texas will increase demand -- and 
therefore prices -- for California and Mexico produce, DeLyer said. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Department of Agriculture official said orange juice price increases may 
be tempered by record stocks being exported by Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
Energy Demand 
</P>
<P>
Fuel-price shocks were exacerbated by fears of short supply in the wake of a 
Christmas Eve explosion at Exxon Corp.'s refinery at Baton Rouge, La., and 
smaller refinery fires elsewhere. January heating oil contracts spiked 10.74 
cents above Friday's level to close at 92.48 cents a gallon on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange, a record one-day movement. 
</P>
<P>
Partly in sympathy, February contracts for West Texas Intermediate, the 
benchmark U.S. crude, rose 62 cents to close at $21.91 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole heating system is under pressure because this cold wave is so 
widespread," said John Lichtblau, president of the industry-funded Petroleum 
Industry Research Foundation in New York. He said heating oil prices were les 
than 60 cents a gallon a month ago. Demand for distillates, including home 
heating oil and diesel fuel, was up 15% to 20% nationwide and as much as 25% to 
30% on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Exxon's 450,000-barrel-a-day Baton Rouge refinery will remain shut 
indefinitely after an explosion that killed one worker and burned storage tanks 
holding millions of gallons of heating oil and other fuels. A second Exxon 
refinery, in Baytown, Tex., slowed production because of unusual cold weather 
in the Houston area. A spokesman said enough heating oil remains in inventory 
and pipelines for Exxon to meet contracts at least through the first week of 
January. 
</P>
<P>
A Phillips Petroleum Co. refinery in Sweeny, Tex., damaged by a fire Friday, 
will remain closed for at least a week. A fire also damaged an Amoco refinery 
in Casper, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the cold was wreaking havoc on Gulf Coast refineries. Marathon Oil 
Co.'s 250,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Garyville, La., was expected to remain 
closed for at least a few more days after equipment froze. Mobil Corp.'s 
280,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Beaumont, Tex., similarly had a weekend 
shutdown because of the cold. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy demand for natural gas along the frigid East Coast was squeezing supplies 
even in balmy Los Angeles. On Saturday, when Southern California Gas received 
about 60% of its normal supply, the utility alerted its nonresidential, 
industrial customers about a possible curtailment of supply, but that turned 
out to be unnecessary, said utility spokesman Ralph Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials met Saturday in Washington with about 80 state and industry 
representatives and agreed to waive certain rules to ease the transportation of 
home heating oil, natural gas and propane to hard-hit areas, said Mary Kayne 
Heinze of the Department of Energy. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen Gulf of Mexico gas wells were expected to be back in operation now that 
gale-force winds have subsided and crews can get to offshore platforms to thaw 
equipment, said Mack Price, spokesman for Panhandle Eastern Corp. in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism 
</P>
<P>
The freeze did not affect Florida's $20-billion tourism industry -- mainly, 
said industry observers, because vacationers consider such weather aberrations 
as just that. Temperatures in the 70s and 80s are expected to return to Florida 
by this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many vacationers make their plans far in advance, often purchasing 
airline tickets that are nonrefundable. In addition, Florida's busiest vacation 
period doesn't start until February, running into April. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not seen any cancellations," said Carlos Giraldo, general manager of 
the Central Reservation Service, a company that helps vacationers needing to 
find space in Florida. "In fact, there is a shortage of rooms, especially the 
two busiest destinations, Miami and Orlando, beginning Wednesday through New 
Year's Day." 
</P>
<P>
Some people were prevented from getting to Florida and other destinations such 
as Charleston, S.C., and Savannah, Ga., because the airports there and in some 
other cities were closed for much of the Christmas weekend because they lacked 
equipment to remove snow. 
</P>
<P>
Delta Air Lines was forced to cancel about 30 flights during the weekend. 
United Airlines reported a higher-than-normal number of "no-shows" for flights 
over the weekend. But only people with tickets having no restrictions were able 
to make such last-minute plans, and United's advance bookings for the busy 
Florida tourist season are heavy, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the closed airports may have increased business at some resorts. "We 
probably trapped more (travelers) than (those) we didn't get," said Jean 
McComb, director of communications for the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce. 
Jacksonville is not a big destination point for Christmas weekend travelers. 
Moreover, the area had more sleet than it had in the last century, she added. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Turtle Inn &amp; Hotel also had a captive clientele for a while, said 
Dodie Jones, sales manager of the inn, which is on the beach near Jacksonville. 
"We had a lot of people . . . stuck at the hotel because the airport was shut 
down," she said. Jones added that guests who had planned to visit families on 
Saturday were unable to do so, packing the inn's restaurant, she said, while 
others, unable to get out of Florida, extended their stays.

HOLIDAY GIFT-GIVING-BACK SEASON BEGINS; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: ONE WORKER'S ACCOUNT OF THE DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS, OFTEN THE MOST 
STRESSFUL OF THE SEASON. CUSTOMERS CAN BE SURLY -- AND LESS THAN HONEST. 
</P>

<P>
It was the day after Christmas, and Kiel Bisceglia was ready for all hell to 
break loose. 
</P>
<P>
He was in charge of the crew of eight at the refunds center set up Tuesday in 
the Fallbrook Mall Target store, girding to handle the onslaught of customers 
who would want exchanges or money back for their unwanted coffee pots, video 
games and sweat suits. 
</P>
<P>
Already a veteran of a past day-after-Christmas exchange blitz, 19-year-old 
Bisceglia has seen it all: a customer who tried to return a nearly empty can of 
nuts because, she said, they didn't taste good; people who brought in sealed 
television and telephone boxes containing nothing more than bricks, hoping that 
an unsuspecting clerk would hand over cash before finding out what actually was 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
Customers who return gifts can be hard on salespeople and retailers' profits, 
but clerks at Target and many other stores are told to make exchanges as 
hassle-free as possible. To help matters, these stores often put their best 
employees at the return counter. 
</P>
<P>
"We do it so they (customers) will say, 'Great,' I should do business there 
more often,' " explained George Hite, a spokesman at Target Stores' 
headquarters in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, no store wants its staff to be bamboozled by a shopper who 
comes in for a refund on an out-of-style sport shirt that was bought somewhere 
else a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
So Bisceglia, well aware of the balancing act he must perform, got to work at 
5:30 a.m. and prepared to handle his job with grace. It couldn't be nearly as 
bad, he figured, as the madhouse atmosphere of the last few days before 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
And in the early hours, at least, it wasn't. Bisceglia spent most of his first 
few hours on the job handling routine preparations. 
</P>
<P>
Even more than an hour after the store opened at 7 a.m., Bisceglia -- a 
friendly, patient young man -- was biding his time by leaning against a cash 
register and asking a co-worker how her weekend went. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, however, the action picked up and the West Hills store was 
bustling. Bisceglia soon faced a customer who questioned him sharply about why 
he gave her a refund of only $32.91 when her receipt totaled $35.05. He quickly 
pointed out that the receipt was for two items and she was returning only one 
of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh," she replied. "Sorry." 
</P>
<P>
That kind of confrontation was nothing new for Bisceglia. Sometimes, he said 
later, customers "get all huffy and puffy, and then when they realize it's 
their fault, they feel stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Before long, a momentary mini-crisis emerged when a customer who exchanged an 
item set off the store's security alarm while heading out the door. It turned 
out that the store had installed a new security system that requires some 
merchandise to be decoded before leaving the store, and no one gave the refunds 
center the necessary decoding pad. Bisceglia said he'd take care of it as soon 
as he could. 
</P>
<P>
A little later, the customer service staffers were abuzz after they foiled a 
shopper trying to pull an all-too-common stunt. The shopper brought in a pair 
of Jordache jeans with a $32.99 Target price tag. Trouble is, Target normally 
doesn't sell those jeans or any other pants costing more than $25. Apparently, 
the customer took the tag from another item and stuck it on the jeans in hopes 
of tricking a sales clerk and walking away with cash. 
</P>
<P>
Renee Greco, one of Bisceglia's customer service clerks, politely told the 
shopper that the pants were from another store, and he quickly darted out. 
"They don't want to get caught," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Bisceglia's toughest call of the day came at 12:30 p.m., when he was 
approached by a tall young man with a stack of five video games worth about 
$200. There was no receipt, but the customer wanted his money back anyway. "It 
just didn't look right," Bisceglia said. 
</P>
<P>
So Bisceglia first asked the man for his driver's license and then checked his 
name against the store's log of customers who have gotten three or more large 
cash refunds without receipts in the past; these people can be denied further 
refunds. This customer, however, didn't show up on the list, so Bisceglia 
cleared him for the refund, even though his gut instinct told him that 
something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
That type of stress comes often for customer service personnel. Target 
officials say many employees dislike giving refunds to shoppers they suspect 
don't deserve them -- people who they fear stole the merchandise or perhaps 
used it for a long time before bringing it back. But as long as there is no 
proof of something amiss, Target employees are supposed to accept the return. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's hard to get the employees to do that," said Jeff Biddle, the 
store manager. "They want to protect the company, along with the customers." 
</P>
<P>
Added Bisceglia: "It just kills us sometimes, but you've got to do it." 
</P>
<P>
The store does take precautions to protect itself. If someone wants to return a 
newly bought item that was on sale recently, the store's policy is to give the 
customer credit only for the sale price -- even if it is possible that the item 
was bought at the full retail price. All the same, if the customer claims to 
actually have paid the higher price, he or she is supposed to get full credit 
for that amount. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, customers seemed pleased Tuesday. Many, in fact, lauded the 
Target store's service and said they were pleasantly surprised to have their 
exchanges settled in a matter of a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was real nice," said Sandi Galperen of Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Bisceglia clearly deserved some of the credit for the refund center's smooth 
performance. Managers at the store had nothing but praise for him, marveling at 
how cool he stays under pressure despite his youth. 
</P>
<P>
Bisceglia, though, acknowledged that the job takes a toll on him. Although he's 
not sure what he wants to do with his future, he is fairly certain that he 
won't pursue a long-term career in retailing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just too stressful," he said. "It's very stressful." 
</P>

Bisceglia has seen it all when it comes to customers trying to exchange holiday 
gifts. This year was no different for the retail employee as the Christmas 
returns began. Gift returns can be hard on sales people and retailers' profits, 
but clerks try to keep customers happy.

NEW TOOL IN DRUG WAR: MONEY LAUNDERING NEWSLETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MIAMI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Business executives, bank officers, lawyers, real estate brokers and even car 
dealers have been drafted into the war on drugs -- whether they like it or not. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with stiff new regulations passed under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1988, the 
IRS and other federal agencies are forcing businesses and financial 
institutions to help track the estimated $220 million in profits generated 
daily by illegal drug sales in this country. 
</P>
<P>
"All that cash does no good stored in boxes. They have to turn it around. That 
necessarily involves legitimate businesses," said Miami lawyer Charles 
Intriago, who has started a publication that promises to make sense of the 
regulatory maze and keep subscribers on the right side of the law. 
</P>
<P>
"The government has conscripted the entire business community and required them 
to submit their paper trails," Intriago said. "It's saying, 'OK, you're in the 
war now -- play by the rules or face severe penalties.' " 
</P>
<P>
Money Laundering Alert is an eight-page monthly newsletter of advice, 
statistics and reports on what criminals do to hide the source of their money 
and what government is doing to uncover their schemes. 
</P>
<P>
As trade journals go, Alert has a sizable niche, says Intriago, a former chief 
counsel for the House committee that oversees all banking regulatory agencies. 
He has also prosecuted white-collar criminals and drug traffickers while an 
assistant U.S. attorney in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Amid growing calls for the legalization of drugs and evidence that interdiction 
efforts have failed to reduce the cocaine flowing into this country, money 
laundering controls have become the government's weapon of choice, Intriago 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The money laundering initiative has a higher probability of success than the 
others, such as interdiction. It hits the profit motive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Enlisting the help of banks and other, often unwitting, handmaidens to drug 
traffickers has yielded impressive results. 
</P>
<P>
Days before billionaire Medellin cartel enforcer Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha was 
gunned down in Colombia on Dec. 15, U.S. and Swiss officials traced his profits 
and were able to freeze $61.8 million of his assets in several countries. 
</P>
<P>
Under money laundering laws, banks are required to report large cash 
transactions. Soon, the Treasury Department could also force banks to put names 
and addresses on the estimated $1.25 trillion transferred daily around the 
world on telephone lines. Details of that initiative are laid out in Alert's 
November issue. 
</P>
<P>
These new money laundering laws are in their infancy, and many have yet to be 
enforced. Many otherwise law-abiding businesses may be unaware of the penalties 
they face, Intriago said. 
</P>
<P>
Alert costs $295 a year, but Intriago notes that the Treasury Department can 
now impose $500 fines for every negligent error a bank teller makes on one of 
the required forms. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell me these institutions wouldn't like to receive a publication that could 
spare them thousands of dollars in fines, to say nothing of the bad publicity," 
Intriago said. 
</P>
<P>
With the fourth issue going to press, Alert has more than 200 subscribers, 
ranging from banks, thrifts and credit unions to lawyers and accountants, 
foreign governments and diplomatic offices. 
</P>
<P>
Intriago doesn't mention "drug kingpins" on his list, and he bristles at the 
suggestion that his newsletter could be as useful to criminals as to 
law-abiding citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't do criminal background checks on our subscribers, nor does the Wall 
Street Journal," he said. "A number of criminal defense attorneys have 
subscriptions, however." 
</P>
<P>
One of those attorneys sits on the newsletter's editorial board as well: Neal 
Sonnett of Miami, who represented Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega when 
he was indicted on drug trafficking charges in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very respected attorney," Intriago said, "no matter what his clientele 
is."

CONFERENCE SHARES THE SECRETS OF INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITY: SURVEILLANCE EXPO '89 LET EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS AND INVESTIGATORS 
SEE THE LATEST IN THE SNOOP AND STYMIE BUSINESS.

<P>
To hear it from the mavens of commercial surveillance, there is no such thing 
as paranoia: Your worst fears are probably true. If you think someone is taping 
your phone calls, bugging your office or reading what's in your computer, you 
are probably right. 
</P>
<P>
That fire sprinkler in the ceiling could be a camera; the person on the phone 
who says she is "Judy from accounting" could be an impostor; the janitor could 
be a private investigator ready for a session of "dumpster diving." 
</P>
<P>
That, at least, was the perspective permeating the air earlier this month at 
Surveillance Expo '89 at the Sheraton Washington, a showcase for an industry 
aimed at thwarting industrial spies, computer hackers and traitorous employees 
scheming to sell trade secrets, get back at the boss or embezzle. 
</P>
<P>
The conference provided an opportunity for equipment manufacturers, security 
managers and investigators to see the latest in the snoop and stymie business. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not merchants of fear; we are merchants of fact," said Dar Hyatt, the 
representative from Avtech Industries. The fact, however, seems to be: Don't 
trust anyone. Indeed, he said, "Ninety percent of the people who attend my 
stand (at trade shows) are crooks!" 
</P>
<P>
The crooks he was referring to are a new breed, skilled and professional, and 
often without any sense that what they are doing is wrong. Changing a number in 
a computer program may seem less criminal than holding up a service station, 
but it can be theft nonetheless -- albeit harder to detect and harder to prove. 
</P>
<P>
Given the murky legal options -- much of the frontier of computer crime and 
industrial espionage is uncharted legal territory -- many firms are looking to 
settle their problems themselves, hiring security firms to prevent abuses or to 
detect them when they occur. Security is a $14-billion industry, according to 
Frost and Sullivan Inc., which publishes reports with titles like "Access 
Control Equipment Market." 
</P>
<P>
People like Arthur Donnelly, a private investigator from New York who attended 
the conference, are part of the industry. Donnelly, a stocky, bearded fellow, 
is of the new breed of private investigator -- he doesn't try to get dirt on 
philandering spouses; he gets dirt on corporate executives. Or their employees. 
And things more mundane than that. 
</P>
<P>
Once, he said, he was hired by a bank that had lost $50 million worth of 
business by ignoring information about a new stock about to come on the market. 
The bank wanted to know who had been responsible for ignoring the tip. Another 
time he was hired by a fast-food chain to spy on a franchisee suspected of 
buying supplies from another source. Donnelly sat in his surveillance van, 
equipped with a periscope, and watched all the delivery trucks that came and 
went until he had clear evidence of bootleg buns. 
</P>
<P>
"Industrial espionage isn't just one company trying to find out trade secrets," 
said Donnelly during a break in the surveillance lectures. "Companies hire us 
to find out how their employees are reacting to a change, or to get information 
on the key executives in another company. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say Yuppie A Executive and Yuppie B Executive are at the same management 
level," Donnelly said. "They know they may one day be rivals for a higher 
position. So Yuppie A orders up an investigation of B, hoping to find something 
-- drug problem, a money problem, a woman problem -- that he can use against 
him later." 
</P>
<P>
One of Donnelly's favorite techniques is going undercover -- currently he is 
working as a data processor in a company to get information about employee 
reaction to a personnel change. He also has worked as a janitor, a systems 
director and a management trainer. 
</P>
<P>
Another favorite tactic -- and Donnelly is not alone in this -- is posing as a 
"market researcher" to get information from a particular company. Is it legal?

"It's not criminal," said August Bequai, a Washington lawyer who led a seminar 
on the "Legal Loopholes of Corporate Espionage." But, he added, "You might find 
yourself sued." 
</P>
<P>
Donnelly also has gotten useful information from the trash -- a practice known 
as "dumpster diving." 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize what they throw out," he said. "And the Supreme Court has 
ruled that once you put it out it's public property." 
</P>
<P>
It was, he said, some clever dumpster diving by a private investigator that 
uncovered a recent Food and Drug Administration case against a manufacturer of 
phony generic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
To protect himself from his peers, Donnelly has paper shredders in both his 
office and his home. He also has an unlisted home number and doesn't carry 
pictures of his wife and daughter in his wallet. 
</P>
<P>
Donnelly knows the electronics of the business -- laser listening devices that 
can pick up a conversation through walls, the radio monitors that can tune in 
calls made on cellular phones, the bugs that can be placed with ease in a room 
-- but two of his main tools are surprisingly old-fashioned. One is a colleague 
who can read lips; the other is the public library. While Donnelly tracks 
people and paper for clients, Susan Headley has been one of the people he might 
have found. 
</P>
<P>
A self-described former hacker, she now is a professional poker player in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Headley, who goes by the hacker handle Susie Thunder, described herself as a 
self-taught expert. 
</P>
<P>
At age 8, she built a "black box," one of those illegal devices that allowed 
her to make free long-distance telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Sporting white cowboy boots and a purple tie-dyed, studded dress that made her 
a standout in the crowd, Headley was at the convention to give a seminar on the 
"psychological subversion of EDP (electronic data processing) systems." 
</P>
<P>
Her fascination is figuring out how to circumvent security systems, a talent 
she developed as a teen-ager at rock 'n' roll concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Having conquered the world of bodyguards and backstage passes, she fell in with 
a group of teen-age computer hackers and soon was ready to tackle any computer 
system as long as she had a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
She is blunt and open about her colorful past, she said, to create awareness 
about how easy it is to invade computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
She said she has inveigled free tickets for airline flights and concerts, set 
herself up as a phantom employee of a telephone company to have access to its 
systems and indulged in other hacker tricks. 
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by about 600 people, somewhat fewer than organizer 
James A. Ross had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
A man from the Department of Defense gave an illustrated lecture on terrorism 
that was well attended, and Barbara A. Rowan, an Alexandria, Va., consultant on 
white-collar crime, lectured on the legality of recording telephone 
conversations. 
</P>
<P>
There were a number of talks about computer security, and an exhibit hall that 
featured an assortment of what industry wags refer to as "toys," ranging from a 
television camera in a tie clip to the latest in penetration-proof rooms. 
</P>
<P>
One lecturer, Washington attorney Joel R. Wolfson, had prepared a talk on 
possible legal strategies for dealing with computer viruses -- clandestine 
software programs that are designed to disrupt computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
He came equipped with his own computer and a "virus" program that he had 
concocted to show how easy it was to wreak havoc with a system and how 
important it was to have safeguards. 
</P>
<P>
He had only one problem: His computer wouldn't work.

LUNDBERG SURVEY AMENDS ITS REPORT OF FEWER GAS STATIONS 
</P>

<P>
The Lundberg Survey said Tuesday that the number of service stations in 
Southern California declined 2.9% in 1989, not 5.33% as it said earlier this 
month in a preliminary report that contained computational errors. 
</P>
<P>
According to the results of a September census -- first reported in The Times 
last week -- the number of service stations in a four-county area declined to 
4,614 in 1989 from 4,751 in June, 1988. Lundberg had erroneously reported that 
the number had fallen to 4,972 from 5,262. 
</P>
<P>
Lundberg also corrected its calculations of the number of gasoline nozzles in 
Southern California: 66,300 in 1989, compared to 61,286 in 1988. That works out 
to 14.4 per station this year, compared to 12.9 per station in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
And Lundberg amended its estimate of the total number of service bays: 6,594 in 
1989, compared to 6,958 in 1988. That's a decline of only 5.2%, not 24.46% as 
it originally reported. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the new Lundberg figures continued to support the conclusion that 
Southern California motorists are seeing fewer, but bigger, service stations in 
the area that includes Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside 
counties. That is in keeping with national trends toward higher volume, 
lower-service stations in fewer places. 
</P>
<P>
The trend is even more dramatic given the growth in the vehicle population of 
Southern California, to 9.17 million vehicles in 1989 from 8.97 million in 
1988, according to the new edition of the Lundberg Letter due this week. 
</P>
<P>
"While the gasoline station population fell by 2.9%, the vehicle population 
swelled by 2.3%," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lundberg Survey is a widely consulted gasoline market research firm based 
in North Hollywood.

JAPANESE WANT MORE U.S. REAL ESTATE, POLL FINDS; 
</P>
<P>
JAPAN: EXECUTIVES SURVEYED PUT CALIFORNIA NO. 1 ON THE LIST OF PLACES TO 
PURCHASE PROPERTY IN 1990. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In sharp contrast to the current pessimism among U.S. real estate executives, 
Japanese companies are bullish about the 1990 outlook for property investments, 
especially in the Southern California region, according to a new survey. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese firms expect to increase their real estate investment in 1990 from 
1989 in certain regions of the United States, but some plan to scale back in 
the Southwest, according to the survey of 200 executives of Japanese 
subsidiaries and branch offices in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The survey is the first indication of spending plans by Japanese companies. "I 
was surprised on how bullish the Japanese were," said Christopher Mead, 
president of Mead Ventures Inc. His Phoenix firm, which publishes several 
newsletters and other information on international business, conducted the 
survey between Nov. 10 and Dec. 8 for Mead's 1990 edition of "Japanese 
Investment in U.S. and Canadian Real Estate Directory." 
</P>
<P>
"I was among the many people who believed that the Japanese interest in the 
United States had peaked," Mead said. "While there still will be a heavy level 
of investment here, I didn't see that it was going to get any higher. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been some opposition to Japanese investment emerging in places like 
Hawaii," Mead said. "We also had heard the Japanese government was quietly 
urging Japanese investors not to buy high-profile U.S. properties. But not long 
after that, Mitsubishi bought a chunk of the Rockefeller Center." 
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted after the announcement Oct. 31 that Mitsubishi Estate 
Co. had bought a 51% stake in the Rockefeller Group, which owns Rockefeller 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Findings of the survey showed 17.5% of the respondents indicated that their 
companies plan significant increases in real estate investment in 1990, while 
46% projected some increases. The most attractive U.S. metropolitan area for 
Japanese real estate activities, according to the survey, is Los Angeles. That 
is followed by New York City, San Francisco, Honolulu and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"The strength of California is overwhelming with three of the top five cities, 
even after the earthquake. It was impressive," said Mead, who noted that the 
city rankings also revealed a wide portion of the country is being passed over 
by most Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
The optimism of Japanese companies contrasts with the apprehensive view of 1990 
among U.S. real estate executives, according to Mead, who publishes the monthly 
newsletter "Japanese Investment in U.S. Real Estate Review." He attributed the 
difference to the Japanese having easy access to capital while may American 
companies are having difficulty raising cash. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mead said that with the traditional Japanese business focus on the 
long term, many Japanese firms may not be as worried as Americans about the ups 
and downs in the U.S. real estate market. They also invest in markets where 
prices are rising or stable -- not falling. 
</P>
<P>
A few respondents to the survey expressed concern about American opposition to 
Japan real estate investment in the United States. However, not many said they 
considered local attitudes to Japanese investment when they selected cities or 
states for purchases. 
</P>
<P>
The most attractive states for Japanese investment, according to the results of 
the survey, were California, New York, Hawaii, Illinois and Washington. Mead 
said the preferred areas of investment are concentrated on the Pacific and 
Atlantic coasts and Hawaii, with a few exceptions. Investment interest focuses 
within two triangles from Houston to Seattle to Los Angeles and Southern 
California, and from Chicago to Miami to Boston, the survey indicated. 
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that several Japanese firms are cutting back on their 
activities in Texas, Arizona and Colorado, where there is comparatively little 
Japanese investment now. Reasons cited for the cutbacks included overbuilding 
and poor economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Mead said a few Japanese firms seemed to be expecting subsidies for locating in 
a particular area. The prevailing philosophy, however, is to ensure 
profitability over the long run. "Chasing bargains in a weak market could be 
asking for trouble," the survey said.

INVESTMENT IN NEW COMPUTER VENTURES FALLS 
</P>

Venture capital investment in computer start-ups has slackened for the first 
time since the market for initial public offerings in the high-tech sector 
began to cool two years ago, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in investment is linked to the poor performance of technology 
stocks this year, and analysts say it could lead to more efficient screening of 
new issues in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a filter," said Sandy Robertson of Robertson Stephens and Co. "In 
1983 and 1987 that filter was very coarse and a lot of junk got through." 
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by Technologic Partners, which monitors the computer 
market, indicated that venture capital investment dropped by about 33% in the 
third quarter of 1989, to $252 million from $378 million in the year-ago 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The study also reported that many institutional investors in venture capital 
funds are paring back holdings and that venture capitalists may have raised 
about $2 billion in 1989, or one-third of what they raised in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in venture investments parallels a drop in initial public 
offerings, or IPOs, in high-technology companies, which were the economy's most 
promising growth sector in the early 1980s. Computer-related IPOs declined from 
a peak of 108 in 1983 to about a dozen in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the sharp drop in IPOs has resulted in fewer start-ups. "Venture 
capital follows the new-issue market," said James Wolpert, an industry analyst 
at Sterling and Yorke Securities. "You don't put money in unless you can expect 
to get it out soon and technology public offerings are very few, with no great 
enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
Initial offerings have also been dampened by the gloomy performance of many of 
the industry's leading big-capitalization stocks, such as International 
Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
IBM closed Friday at $95.375, down more than 25% from its high for the year of 
$130.875, and Digital closed at $82.75, down more than 30% from its high of 
$122.375. Both were trading at multiples of about 10 times estimated earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Standard and Poor's 500-stock index has risen about 25% this year, with the 
average stock trading at nearly 15 times estimated earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Recently such wunderkind of 1980s technology growth as Compaq Computer Corp. 
and Sun Microsystems Inc. have also been trading at or below 10 times estimated 
earnings. The sector has not been helped by forecasts of continued slow growth 
in the industry, especially in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some of this year's recent new offerings in high technology have 
performed well. Shares of Symantec Corp., a maker of microcomputer software 
products, were issued at $10.50 and later rose more than 70% to $18 before 
settling lower, closing Friday at $15. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Mips Computer Systems Inc., a well-regarded pioneer in more 
efficient reduced instruction set computing, rose in its first two days of 
trading to $20 from its initial offering price of $17.50 a share. The offering 
price is about 22 times Wall Street's estimates of 1990 earnings of about 80 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said tighter funding would help the industry avoid the 1980s glut of 
competing companies in such areas as disk drives, portable computers and 
IBM-compatible personal computers, which led to many failures and 
consolidations.

Consumer prices in Tokyo in 1989 posted the highest year-on-year rise since 
1986, the government's preliminary figures showed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Japan also reported that its nationwide unemployment rate remained at a stable 
2.2% in November. 
</P>
<P>
The Management and Coordination Agency said Tokyo's consumer prices in 1989 
rose 2.7% over the previous year, surpassing a 2.0% year-on-year rise for the 
first time since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said the rise was owed chiefly to the introduction in April of the 
3.0% sales tax, Japan's first such levy. 
</P>
<P>
Food prices increased 2.8%, rents were up 3.2%, clothing costs jumped 5.5% and 
education expenses increased 3.1%, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said consumer prices in December increased 0.1% over November. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said Tokyo's consumer price index for 1989 stood at 106.1 against 
the 1985 base of 100. 
</P>
<P>
The nationwide consumer price index for November stood at 104.5, up 2.3% over a 
year ago, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said Japan's unemployment rate in November stood at 2.2% after 
seasonal adjustments, down 0.1 point from October. 
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate remained stable for the past six months, ranging from 2.2% to 
2.3%. 
</P>
<P>
The number of unemployed totaled 1.33 million, including 790,000 men and 
540,000 women, the agency said.

MILK PRODUCT PRICES UP 9% IN 1989; 
</P>
<P>
DAIRIES: GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASES. PRICES ROSE FOR 
LOW-FAT PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARTHUR S. BRISBANE, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you've been under the impression after your weekly trip to the grocery store 
that you've been paying more for milk products, you're right. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, government tinkering, exports and the weather are to blame for a 
nearly 9% increase in consumer prices for dairy products in the past year, 
dairy experts say. According to government figures, that is more than double 
the rate that prices in general have gone up in 1989 and half again as much as 
all food prices. 
</P>
<P>
And if the news for milk drinkers was not bad enough, the price escalator for 
all dairy goods not only has been rising but has been speeding up. That is 
confirmed by Mark Roeder, public affairs coordinator for Giant Food, who said 
the price of the supermarket chain's popular 2%-fat milk has risen to $2.49 a 
gallon, with the government's consumer price index showing the sharpest 
increases in dairy products coming in the last three months -- up 5% between 
September and November. That's an annual rate in excess of 21%. 
</P>
<P>
The development is a boon to some dairy farmers and has reduced government 
outlays for surplus milk and cheese, but consumers find themselves paying more, 
especially for increasingly popular low-fat dairy products. Commercial users 
such as Domino's Pizza, meanwhile, have to scramble to find enough mozzarella 
to serve their customers. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for soaring prices goes well beyond consumer preferences, however. 
Aggressive steps since 1985 under the Agriculture Department's Dairy 
Termination Program to reduce surplus production of dairy goods -- by paying 
farmers to slaughter or export more than 1.6 million dairy cattle -- have 
pinched supplies and fueled price increases. 
</P>
<P>
The goal for the Dairy Termination Program was to reduce production. A General 
Accounting Office study released earlier this year shows that the program not 
only accomplished that but also led to net savings for the government because 
of reduced government purchases of surplus cheese, nonfat dry milk and butter. 
</P>
<P>
The GAO study shows that without the program, dairy farmers would have produced 
about 5% more this year than they did. 
</P>
<P>
James Miller, a dairy specialist with the Agriculture Department, said another 
important factor in the price increases was a rise in the export of nonfat dry 
milk, primarily to Mexico and Asian countries. With milk committed to that 
market, there was less available domestically, adding to the pressure on 
consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
"Our exports of nonfat (milk) this year are likely to be the equivalent of 4 
billion pounds of skim milk. That is a lot of milk," Miller said. "Our 
(overall) milk production is going to come in at 145 billion pounds, so 
percentage-wise it is not large. But the important thing about dairy is that it 
takes a very tiny change to make a very large difference in prices." 
</P>
<P>
The drought of 1988 also has a continuing effect on dairy prices, according to 
several experts. Robert Vaughn, general manager of the Maryland and Virginia 
Milk Producers Cooperative Assn., said higher feed costs resulting from the 
drought-reduced harvest led some farmers to sell cattle for slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Other experts note that the 1988 drought also affected the quality of forage 
crops this year, leading to lower productivity in milk cows. In the Washington 
region, Vaughn said, rising labor and land costs also have further boosted 
expenses for dairy farmers and have led to cuts in production. 
</P>
<P>
"What is driving the market up is the short supply," he said. "The reason there 
is a short supply is that producers have experienced higher production costs, 
and they have cut back." 
</P>
<P>
Although prices are high now, the forecast for dairy prices is favorable -- for 
a number of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Miller notes that the export commitments for nonfat dry milk are set to expire 
at the end of this year, allowing producers to redirect supplies to the 
domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
A strong harvest of feed grains this year, meanwhile, has lowered the cost of 
feeding dairy herds, a factor that should tend to bring down the costs of 
production next year. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, as the GAO concluded, the Dairy Termination Program's effects are 
expected to be only temporary. In 1991, participating farmers are eligible to 
get back into dairying, a development likely to boost supplies and lower 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
As for pizza, the fluctuations of the dairy business have had some effect on 
prices, but Domino's executives envision an ever-rising demand for mozzarella 
nevertheless. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1987, we used 106 million pounds and in 1988, we had 125 million pounds," 
said Bill Kerans, public relations director for the chain's distribution arm. 
"When the figures come in for this year, we expect it to be higher still." 
</P>
<P>
One dairy item that clearly is bucking the trend of tight supplies is butter, 
which is subject to a different trend in American life. As concern about 
cholesterol leads more and more people to try low-fat milk products, huge 
mounds of unwanted butter are piling up in government warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, butter is the only dairy commodity the government is buying as surplus 
these days. Currently, 135 million pounds of it is being stored by Uncle Sam, 
mostly in limestone caves around Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
"The government continues to purchase (butter), while the consumer preference 
is for lower- and low-fat products," said Ed Coughlin, director of regulatory 
affairs for the National Milk Producers Federation. "The leading increases are 
coming in skim milk products. This year, skim milk sales statistics show 
increases in the magnitude of over 25% versus the same month a year ago."

Walter J. Connolly Jr., chairman and chief executive of the Bank of New England 
Corp., will resign his CEO position when a replacement is found, the troubled 
bank said in a statement Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if this meant Connolly will stay on as chairman, Marcia Ryan, a bank 
spokeswoman, said only "the word of the release is as it stands." She 
acknowledged "there is an ambiguity" about the wording regarding Connolly's 
future position with the bank.

Bank of New England also announced Tuesday that it had designated the executive

Since the bank's troubles began, federal banking regulators have increased 
scrutiny of its operations. Financial analysts had speculated that a major

"It's certainly been rumored around Hartford and Boston that he (Connolly) 
might step aside," said Tracey Stangle, an analyst with First Albany Corp., who 
works out of Hartford, Conn. "I guess for that reason it didn't come as a 
surprise." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after the stock market closed Tuesday. Bank of New 
England was the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, with more 
than 2.2 million shares changing hands. The shares fell 12.5 cents to close at 
$7.375. 
</P>
<P>
Stangle said Connolly has been a driving force at the bank. "He's a very 
strong-willed guy that has run the institution for the past 10 years or so," he 
said, adding it was unclear who would take his place as chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
The bank's board appointed a committee to begin a search for candidates to 
succeed Connolly, who said he would resign his post as chief executive when a 
replacement is found, the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said Connolly will continue working with another board committee 
on further expense reductions, financial matters and other improvements in 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
In another sign of its financial difficulties, the bank on Friday rescinded its 
common stock dividend of 34 cents a share for the fourth quarter. Earlier this 
month, the bank said it would boost its loan reserves above $1 billion and that 
it expected a "substantial" loss for the year. 
</P>
<P>
The new special committees are "designed to assure that the problems faced by 
the organization as a result of the unprecedented developments in the real 
estate market are addressed in a timely and comprehensive manner," the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon I. Ulmer, the company's president, was named to begin an effort to 
address all aspects of the real estate loan portfolio of Bank of New England's 
banking units in Massachusetts. He was charged to report to the executive 
committee of the company's board, assisted by the board's special adviser, 
Washington-based Secura Group. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said the move reflected the serious trouble Bank of New 
England faces due to a real estate slump that affected a number of other banks 
in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of New England also said Tuesday that it is continuing to work with the 
investment firm Lazard Freres &amp; Co. to explore possible asset sales or 
mergers. A special board committee has been named to oversee this effort, the 
company said.

EX-MAYOR OPPOSES BACK PAY BUT IS SEEKING HIS SHARE; 
</P>
<P>
BURBANK: COUNCIL MEMBERS VOTED THEMSELVES A RETROACTIVE RAISE. ONE OF THEM SAYS 
THERE SHOULD BE A RESOLUTION TO INCLUDE RAISES FOR TWO FORMER MEMBERS.

A former mayor of Burbank said Tuesday he still opposes a retroactive salary 
increase City Council members voted themselves last month, but that as long as 
it has passed, he wants his share or he may sue. 
</P>
<P>
Former Mayor Al Dossin said he is entitled to receive up to $2,736 in back pay 
retroactive to 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"Most citizens didn't understand that the pay increase was retroactive," he 
said. "I think it's wrong and selfish. It shows an absolute lack of 
conscience." 
</P>
<P>
But Dossin said that if the council is going to stand by its decision, then he 
and former Councilwoman Mary Kelsey should receive back pay for the four years 
they served on the five-member panel, which chooses the mayor from among its 
members. Both Dossin and Kelsey -- also a former mayor -- were defeated in city 
elections in February. 
</P>
<P>
Kelsey said Tuesday she also opposed the retroactive pay increase, but declined 
to comment on whether she and Dossin should receive any money. "I'm not going 
to get into that," Kelsey said. "If they don't want to give it to us, we can't 
make them." 
</P>
<P>
Dossin said he is considering filing a lawsuit against the city if he does not 
get the retroactive pay. "I think it's very unfair," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager Stephen Helvey said the ordinance that outlines 
provisions for the pay increase was written to include retroactive pay for 
current council members only. But Helvey said the City Council could adopt a 
resolution to include the two former council members as well. 
</P>
<P>
At least one council member said Tuesday that she would support such a 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
The council members voted 4 to 1 last month to raise their salaries from $600 
to $765 a month effective Jan. 1. Councilman Tim Murphy cast the dissenting 
vote, saying he did not feel comfortable voting for a raise. 
</P>
<P>
The five part-time council members had not received a salary increase since 
Jan. 1, 1985, when a voter-approved ordinance went into effect. That ordinance 
set salaries at the same level that council members receive, by state law, in 
some similar-size cities. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance called for a maximum 5% cost-of-living raise to be voted on 
annually by the council. The votes, however, were never taken because of an 
oversight by city staff workers, who discovered the discrepancy while reviewing 
salary provisions for elected officials, City Manager Robert (Bud) Ovrom has 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Mayor Robert R. Bowne and council members Michael Hastings and 
Mary Lou Howard have each received checks for $3,768 -- the money they would 
have made if the cost-of-living allowances had been approved each year -- said 
Larry Wagenbach, accounting operations supervisor for Burbank. Councilmen 
Thomas Flavin and Tim Murphy, both elected in February, received $1,032 apiece, 
Wagenbach said. 
</P>
<P>
Howard, who said she is donating her retroactive pay to charities in Burbank, 
said she would support Dossin and Kelsey receiving the money. Murphy, who 
opposed any salary increase, said it would only be fair for the council to 
consider a resolution that would give the back pay to Dossin and Kelsey. 
</P>
<P>
"But that doesn't mean I'd vote for it," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
The other three council members could not be reached for comment Tuesday.

DEVELOPER PUT UNDER PRESSURE TO REPLACE 104 BULLDOZED TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a case they call the worst tree destruction in Thousand Oaks history, city 
officials are negotiating for compensation from a developer accused of 
bulldozing 104 mature eucalyptuses last March that have been valued by a city 
expert at $311,000, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A limitation in local tree-protection laws has prevented the city from 
prosecuting the Davis Development Co. of Westlake Village, but a need for 
building permits is forcing the company to cooperate, said an attorney for the 
developer and a city planner specializing in trees. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them they can't enforce this, but you need to make things right with 
the city because they can make things tough on you, for lack of a better 
phrase," said the attorney, Michael D. Martello, of the Thousand Oaks land-use 
firm of Cohen, Alexander &amp; Clayton. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing the lost trees and contributing to a fund for planting trees citywide 
are among the possible forms of repayment under consideration, said Thousand 
Oaks urban forester William Elmendorf, Martello and Kathryn C. McMenamin, 
another attorney for the developer. 
</P>
<P>
Martello and McMenamin said another type of tree would be planted because 
eucalyptuses do not root firmly, fall easily, and are considered liabilities. 
Martello called the city's $311,000 appraisal of the trees' value 
unrealistically high, saying the big, valuable trees would probably be replaced 
by smaller, cheaper trees. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Cohen, an attorney representing the developer, met with Elmendorf and 
other officials Thursday to discuss "a response that would be appropriate and 
acceptable," said City Manager Grant W. Brimhall. 
</P>
<P>
The issue remains unresolved, but a settlement is expected in the next several 
weeks, according to Brimhall, who described the bulldozing incident as a grave 
matter in a city that takes its name from a native tree and just adopted an 
ambitious plan to expand its urban forest. 
</P>
<P>
"The community's values have been aggrieved," Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
The eucalyptuses in question, some as tall as 80 feet and 40 years old, were 
felled March 27 on a site off the Ventura Freeway and Newbury Park Road. 
Planted in long rows as windbreaks, the towering eucalyptuses could be seen 
from the highway by motorists entering Thousand Oaks' boundaries. They were 
considered something of a welcome mat to a city that treasures trees, said 
Brimhall and Elmendorf. 
</P>
<P>
Davis Development, which wants to build a light industrial complex on the site, 
had a special-use permit requiring that trees be preserved at the time the 
eucalyptuses were bulldozed. But whether that permit was technically in effect 
-- and therefore, violated -- is a matter of dispute between the developer and 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Brimhall and Elmendorf said the now-expired permit was in effect on March 27. 
But Martello, a former member of Thousand Oaks' legal staff, contended the 
permit had not yet been activated because construction had not begun. Martello 
said the bulldozing is not classed as construction. 
</P>
<P>
After the incident, the city banned construction work at the site and has yet 
to issue new building permits, Elmendorf said. 
</P>
<P>
Another legal obstacle to the city, said Martello, is that an ordinance 
designed to preserve oak trees does not provide protection for eucalyptuses. 
And a city policy aimed at preserving "landmark trees" exists only in the form 
of an unenforceable resolution, not an ordinance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was Martello who prosecuted the city's last significant 
tree-destruction case, in which a Beverly Hills developer was fined $21,000 in 
1986 for felling 27 young oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
Because the trees were protected under the city's oak-preservation ordinance, 
real estate investor Houshang Beroukhim was prosecuted and eventually pleaded 
no contest to charges that he ordered the trees' cutting. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the case was considered the worst of its kind. But Elmendorf said 
the eucalyptus case is far worse because of the number of trees destroyed, 
their age, size and prominence, as well as the cost of replacing them.

'FOLLOW-HOME BANDIT' TRIAL BEGINS; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: THE DEFENDANT IS CHARGED WITH ATTACKING AND ROBBING EIGHT STUDIO CITY 
WOMEN AFTER FOLLOWING THEM HOME FROM THE SUPERMARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jury selection began Tuesday in the trial of a man prosecutors say is the 
"follow-home jewelry bandit" who robbed eight Studio City women last year. 
</P>
<P>
In each case, prosecutors say, Claude Davis Jr., 38, attacked the women in 
their garages or on their front lawns after following them home from 
supermarkets at the intersections of Ventura Boulevard and Coldwater Canyon 
Avenue, and Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards. Davis, who faces a maximum 
sentence of 30 years if convicted, is on felony parole for robbery, his 
attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Ramseyer said that in the preliminary hearing, each 
victim identified Davis as the assailant who robbed them during a string of 
crimes between May and December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ramseyer said Davis was a gentlemanly dresser who wore suits and ties and 
carried a briefcase. He lulled his victims by asking them for directions, and 
as they tried to help him, Ramseyer said, he hit them, usually knocking them 
down. 
</P>
<P>
Among the victims was Joann Puls, 62, who drove up to her Studio City home in 
October, 1988, to find a neatly dressed man standing in front of her garage. 
</P>
<P>
Puls testified in the preliminary hearing that Davis said he needed directions 
to a construction site in the area. Puls said she drew nearer to examine a 
piece of paper in the man's extended hand and he lunged and punched her in the 
face with a clenched fist, knocking her on her back. 
</P>
<P>
He sat on top of her, grabbed her by the throat and pulled off three diamond 
rings, including her wedding ring, she said. When she protested, he threatened 
to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
"They had no reason to suspect anything was wrong until he hit them," Ramseyer 
said. Usually, the robber made off with diamond rings estimated to be worth 
$10,000 to $30,000, and many of the women suffered broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, of Van Nuys, was arrested with his sister-in-law Karen Davis on Jan. 11, 
near a supermarket at Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards, after a special 
police team saw him in front of the market. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not doing things that were conducive to shopping," Los Angeles police 
Detective Bob Searle said. "He looked like he was picking out his next victim." 
</P>
<P>
When police searched his car, Searle said, they found black gloves and a 
briefcase matching the description of those used by the robber. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of the victims said a woman drove the getaway car, no charges 
were filed against Karen Davis because none of the victims could identify her. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Martin R. Gladstein said he could not comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last less than two weeks.

<P>
The Bush Administration has strongly condemned the brutal killings of 
protesters by Romanian security forces, calling this action one in sharp 
contrast to those in the other Eastern bloc countries. The Administration is 
correct; the action is in sharp contrast. 
</P>
<P>
However, another sharp contrast is that of the response of the Administration 
to this event and to very similar, but undoubtedly far worse, events in Beijing 
last June. Those events prompted a very mild, diffident and, as we have learned 
since, hypocritical reaction by this Administration. The difference, it 
appears, is that we have few business or political expectations of Romania, and 
so we may object vigorously, without loss of what we don't have anyway.

CHANGING OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unfortunately, I read Colman McCarthy's column ("This Song Is Your Song and 
Should Be Everyone's,' Op-Ed Page, Dec. 18). Gag! "This Land Is Your Land" as 
our national anthem? He's got to be kidding. I wasn't aware that our great 
country was "made for us." We are lucky to live here. It is primal conceit to 
assume it was all put together just for us good old United States people. 
</P>
<P>
As for the music, Woody Guthrie is OK in his genre (so is Irving Berlin, so is 
Leonard Bernstein, so is J.S. Bach). But Guthrie's monotonous little song, each 
phrase of which has almost the same rhythm and is stuck in the same narrow 
range -- think about it -- somehow lacks the grandeur of a national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
The world's great national anthems, "Finlandia," the "Marseillaise" (yes, it's 
warlike, but how many Americans understand French?), and "God Save the Queen," 
are all taken. They are stirring and memorable national anthems, probably more 
loved for their music than for their texts. 
</P>
<P>
Of our present choices, I prefer "America the Beautiful." As music, its rhythm 
is also repetitious, but the phrases are longer, and the melody soars. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a better solution would be to commission one of our composers to write 
a national anthem that is good music and at the same time will appeal to the 
broad base of musical taste. 
</P>
<P>
With some changes here and there, which some talented poet could effect, 
Katherine Lee Bates' "America the Beautiful" is fine. I'll go along with 
leaving God out of it, although I wonder to what party McCarthy attributes the 
wonders of nature, the Republican? 
</P>
<P>
"This Land Is Your Land"? Pardon me, Guthrie-lovers, but must the cultural 
wasteland that the United States is becoming be constantly helped along by the 
musical tastes of the Colman McCarthys?

CHANGING OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM

<TEXT>
<P>
Making Guthrie's song into the national anthem is a good idea. I've been 
sympathetic to the idea of replacing "The Star Spangled Banner" as the national 
anthem ever since I heard the idea expressed on "All in the Family" many years 
ago, but I wasn't too thrilled with the idea of replacing it with "America the 
Beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
I don't have anything against "The Star Spangled Banner," mind you. I don't 
have anything against "America the Beautiful," either. I just think we ought to 
change the national anthem, and I would personally like to see it replaced with 
something that, on the one hand, couldn't be objectionable to anyone while, on 
the other, wouldn't be so watered-down that it wouldn't be inspirational. "This 
Land Is Your Land" is the perfect sort of song if you think about it. 
</P>
<P>
Just the other day, I saw Dale Evans on one of those Christian stations singing 
it. I let her finish before I turned (the channel). 
</P>
<P>
Also, Guthrie was the sort of American who ought to have one of his songs as 
the national anthem. Pete Seeger said in a documentary that when the FBI came 
to ask him about the so-called communist conspiracy, Guthrie made up a song 
with, as I recall, the following words: "They said would I fight for my 
country/ I answered the FBI 'Yea'/ I will point a gun for my country./ But I 
won't guarantee you which way."

KEEPING TRACK OF HATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hate crimes -- acts of vandalism, assault or murder triggered by race, 
ethnicity or sexual preference -- may be rising dramatically. Civil rights 
activists certainly think so, but evidence is hard to come by. The Hate Crimes 
Statistics Act, pending before the Senate, would help clarify the picture and 
provide a data base for national policies designed to curb hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The act calls on the Justice Department to collect data for five years on 
crimes motivated by race, religion, ethnicity or homosexuality. Murders, 
assaults, arson, robberies, thefts, threats, and acts of vandalism or trespass 
would be counted. The comprehensive tabulation would provide a broader and more 
complete picture of hate-related incidents and allow a more accurate comparison 
from region to region and year to year. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, co-sponsored by Sens. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) and Orrin G. Hatch 
(R-Utah), does not describe how the data would be collected, but the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation already gathers statistics on a variety of crimes from 
nearly 16,000 law-enforcement agencies, and hate crimes could simply be added 
to that annual Uniform Crime Report. 
</P>
<P>
Simon is a liberal Democrat and Hatch a conservative Republican and their bill 
has attracted support from more than 40 senators, President Bush and Atty. Gen. 
Dick Thornburgh. But it has detractors. Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) derailed a 
similar measure last year because the reporting requirements included crimes 
against homosexual men and women. Gay-bashing crimes should be included in the 
bill.

Hate complicates crime. A swastika spray-painted on the wall of a synagogue is 
more than graffiti. A cross-burning at the home of a black family is more than 
simple arson. These crimes trigger a greater fear, because the victims know 
that such attacks are not random. 
</P>
<P>
Hate crimes range from vandalism to murder. The FBI, for example, is 
investigating racial motivation in the letter bombs that killed a federal judge 
in Birmingham, Ala., and an alderman in Savannah, Ga., earlier this month. A 
young black man in search of a used car was killed last summer in the 
Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn because white youths thought he was there to 
see a neighborhood girl. 
</P>
<P>
State investigators believe the deranged gunman who shot five children to death 
in a Stockton schoolyard earlier this year was at least partly motivated by the 
fact that they were of Asian descent. Is this what America is coming to? The 
country needs to make an organized effort to find out.

NORIEGA: THE CARTEL COULDN'T TOUCH HIM WHEN HE WAS A TOP DOG. NOW THAT HE'S A

On Christmas Eve, Gen. Manuel A. Noriega quietly slipped into the Papal 
Nunciature in Panama City and asked for asylum. Almost immediately, the stock 
of the new government of Guillermo Endara went up and resistance to U.S. 
military forces declined. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega undoubtedly will get the asylum, and the safe transit, he seeks. 
Although some parties will protest, in the long run everyone -- with the 
exception, perhaps, of Noriega -- will breathe easier for it. 
</P>
<P>
Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholic Church can hardly turn away a downtrodden suppliant (even if 
he is a thug), especially since the papal nuncio has had dealings with Noriega 
in the past. Further, to hand Noriega over to the United States might be 
interpreted as an endorsement of the U.S. military action, which the nuncio 
certainly would want to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
More basically, the principle of sanctuary has a historical dimension for the 
church. If the church turns Noriega over to the United States at Washington's 
request, that will jeopardize the principle for the future. The loser next time 
around could be a Cardinal Mindszenty. After the ill-fated 1956 Hungarian 
uprising, Cardinal Josef Mindszenty, Roman Catholic prelate of Hungary, took 
refuge for 15 years in the U.S. Embassy in Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
In the past Spain had offered Noriega a place to retire, but under very 
different circumstances. Today, it is more likely that Noriega will try to get 
into Cuba, a better place to live than Nicaragua, his other regional ally. But 
despite long ties to the Havana government, there is no love lost between 
Noriega and Fidel Castro. The Panamanian might just be one additional burden 
that the already beleaguered Castro doesn't need right now, or he might be 
welcomed as the latest symbol of Latin American resistance to Yankee 
imperialism. 
</P>
<P>
The Endara government and most Panamanians want him dead or out of the country, 
not on trial in Panama City. To try him in court there would bring up far too 
much dirt about far too many people still in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Panama cannot legally honor a request to turn over Noriega since it 
has no extradition treaty with the United States. It would be foolish to try to 
force Endara to go against Panamanian law, for that would strengthen the 
(untrue) case that the new president is just a creature of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, for all the tough statements on bringing Noriega to Florida to stand 
trial, it isn't all that clear that the United States wants -- or should want 
-- him here. There is reason to doubt the strength of the two indictments 
against him. Through he undoubtedly was involved in drug dealing, the 
indictments were based on evidence from convicted drug dealers who were plea 
bargaining. The trials could be messy, even unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Were he to go on trial, his lawyers would demand all sorts of documentation 
that could prove detrimental to U.S. security. After all, Noriega worked for 
years with U.S. intelligence agencies and the military. 
</P>
<P>
But Noriega has a problem with exile -- the drug lords. In the past he has had 
disputes with the Medellin cartel. As long as he was top dog in Panama, he was 
useful to them. Now that he is a nobody who knows far too much about the drug 
business, they would much prefer to have him in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, sanctuary followed by asylum suggests that the immediate solution of the 
Noriega problem is at hand, and with it much improved prospects for an end to 
all fighting and the growth of the new Panamanian society. Ultimate justice for 
Noriega, however, may yet be administered by the more lawless elements of the 
world.

PANAMA: THE INVASION SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A SUCCESSFUL, JUSTIFIABLE AND 
PROPORTIONATE USE OF FORCE.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, Jan. 10, 1990 -- U.S. officials today confirmed the death of 23 
American citizens in Panama as violence escalated overnight in the capital. The 
total number of American deaths has now reached 48 since an off-duty Marine was 
killed last December. U.S. troops have been placed on alert and the evacuation 
of military dependents has begun from Howard Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest incident is seen as retaliation for the killing of eight 
Panamanians Sunday by Marine security guards who fired as a mob made up 
primarily of so-called Dignity Battalion members assaulted the U.S. Embassy. 
Two Marines died in the attack, which is still under investigation. In a radio 
broadcast, Gen. Manuel A. Noriega reiterated that a state of war existed 
between Panama and the United States, that the deaths of the Panamanians during 
a "peaceful" demonstration at the U.S. Embassy revealed the true hostile nature 
of American policy in Panama, and that all Americans would be treated as 
combatants. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, members of Congress criticized what they called the "criminal 
inaction" of the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Of course we will never know whether a similar series of events could have 
occurred if U.S. forces had not intervened in Panama last week. We do know that 
second-guessing began almost immediately. Some questioned the use of force on 
principle. Others who supported the goal of the invasion wondered whether the 
cost, both at home and abroad, might be too high to justify the use of force. 
Still others argued that the invasion actually made things worse with regard to 
the publicly stated goals of U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
At present, the situation in Panama is far from resolved. To date, 23 American 
servicemen have been killed and 330 have been wounded. Panamanian casualties, 
including civilians, are believed to be high. Order is being restored, but the 
Dignity Battalions still hold sway in parts of Panama City. Noriega has avoided 
capture by U.S. forces by fleeing to the residence of the Papal Nuncio. The 
government of President Guillermo Endara is still in transition. In many 
respects, the hardest part of the U.S. effort is yet to come. The 
re-establishment of order will take some doing, even with Noriega no longer 
directing the resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even in light of the current uncertainty, the U.S. action in Panama seems 
to have been a justifiable and even proportionate use of force. The killing of 
an American serviceman, the abduction of another serviceman and his wife and 
the wounding of a Panamanian soldier by an American indicated that a spiral of 
escalating violence had become a very real possibility, one that the President 
could not ignore. Have Americans so quickly forgotten Tehran? 
</P>
<P>
The plan for the use of force itself appears to have been sound and well 
executed. Accordingly, the prospects for a favorable outcome in Panama are 
good. Military planners had determined that, based on a realistic intelligence 
assessment, the exclusive use of special operations forces to take Noriega out 
faced a high probability of failure, with its attendant political costs. 
Another option, the use of forces already stationed in Panama, was rejected as 
well. Insufficient force would have indicated a failure to learn from Beirut. A 
President who decides to use force owes it to the nation's servicemen and their 
families to use all that is necessary to prevail quickly. To his everlasting 
credit, President Bush did just that. 
</P>
<P>
Some Americans have come to believe that even justifiable force should be used 
only if there is a guarantee that all goals can be accomplished almost 
immediately and with little cost. Of course, the problem with war and war plans 
is that, as Karl von Clausewitz observed 150 years ago, an adversary is an 
entity that reacts. Thus, even the best plans seldom survive first contact with 
the enemy. Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
provided the President with no illusions. The operation, he made clear, would 
take time without the promise of immediate success. Nonetheless, the military 
goals seem to have been largely achieved. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows what the future holds for U.S. policy in Panama. Guerrilla warfare 
remains a distinct threat. The highest priority has to be given to shoring up 
the legitimate government of President Endara. Once military objectives are 
achieved, and once order is restored, U.S. forces will be phased out as quickly 
as security permits. 
</P>
<P>
Every now and again a great power has to act like one. If it doesn't, it 
creates the possibility that what used to be called tin-horn dictators may come 
to believe that they are exempt from the constraints of civilized behavior. 
When that happens, the world becomes a far more dangerous place.

FREE ROMANIA TELEVISION FUELED NATION'S REVOLUTION;

REVOLT: THE STATE STATION, ONCE A PROPAGANDA TOOL, HAS BECOME THE HEART AND

<TEXT>
<P>
The television station that once beamed the glory of Nicolae Ceausescu to a 
numbed nation has become not only the voice, but the soul of the revolution 
that toppled his government and ended his life. 
</P>
<P>
While everything it broadcast once was suspect, nothing now is believed until 
it appears on Free Romania Television, as the station is calling itself. 
Although he was reported captured and executed, it wasn't until television 
showed Ceausescu in captivity that the nation sighed in relief. 
</P>
<P>
The station first broke from the propaganda of the Stalinist past Friday 
morning, when army units joined protesters to drive Ceausescu from his palace 
and from power. 
</P>
<P>
"We've won. We've won," poet Murica Dinescu suddenly shouted into the camera. 
But those giddy opening moments only were a prelude to the battles with 
Ceausescu loyalists that followed. 
</P>
<P>
The National Salvation Committee clung to the television like a mantle of 
power, running the country from a barricaded studio while Ceausescu's fanatical 
guard tried to blast it into silence. Sniper fire smashed windows and heavy 
shells blew holes in the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday morning, news editor Victor Ionescu announced on the air:"We are 
under attack." He urged people to rally outside the TV station in a massive 
human shield to protect the building. Almost immediately, a crowd formed. 
</P>
<P>
People chanted, "Freedom! Freedom!" until gunfire broke out. Each time, they 
scattered and regrouped. They shouted, "We won't go," and they didn't. 
Outgunned, the attackers pulled back. 
</P>
<P>
Later that weekend, Ceausescu's guard struck again. Infiltrators stabbed people 
in the hallways of the 13-story complex, reportedly killing three. For a few 
hours, TV screens went mysteriously blank. 
</P>
<P>
But the interruption was merely a technical problem, it was explained. Romania 
was still governed from a hectic studio littered with empty bottles, cracked 
coffee mugs and half-eaten sandwiches and run by people who had not slept in 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Television has played a large role in the forces of reform that swept the East 
Bloc this year. Mass demonstrations were shown live on TV in Czechoslovakia in 
the days preceding the Communist leadership's downfall; East Germans able to 
watch West German broadcasts followed closely news of the loosening of travel 
restrictions and the rallies that brought down Erich Honecker; a Solidarity 
economic minister goes on the air with regular "fireside chats" to the people. 
</P>
<P>
Free Romania Television has become a chaotic reflection of the country it 
covers, a jumbled but jubilant mirror of the revolution it helped orchestrate. 
</P>
<P>
"It is madness here, madness," said Gratiela Ripeanu. Her external relations 
job used to consist mainly of shaking hands with fraternal Bulgarians. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, she was shepherding countless foreign TV crews all desperate to relay 
film back home. Reporters counted on her to find them National Salvation 
Committee members to interview. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, she steered people and their bulky gear through an obstacle course 
of gun barrels, locked gates, roiling crowds and skittish guards who looked for 
explosives in ballpoint pen refills. Six body searches separated the street 
from the studio. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what we are doing anymore, but we're doing it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Elena Maria Ionescu, a news writer and Victor's wife, helped out in the studio, 
partly because her office was a gaping hole in the eighth floor. 
</P>
<P>
She smiled broadly when she recognized several reporters who had sat with her 
until morning during the first assault. 
</P>
<P>
They had subsequently stayed in the relative luxury of hotel rooms, but she was 
still on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I've slept here, ate here, washed things out here," she said. "My husband is 
so hoarse he can hardly talk on the air." Nevertheless, she seemed ready for 
another four days. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the station's 1,300 employees were caught up in the mad metamorphosis. 
</P>
<P>
Until the revolution, the station broadcast only two hours daily, a deadening 
litany of the heroic and 
</P>
<P>
generous qualities of Ceausescu. Romania's austerity budget left it short of 
equipment and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, it was on the air around the clock, and Romanians who once scorned 
television sat glued to their screens. 
</P>
<P>
Technicians cannibalized old gear and pushed technical tolerances to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
Armed soldiers wandered across the set, and overtired officials reverted to the 
hated communist term for comrade, tovarase, rather than domnul, or mister, but 
the show went on. 
</P>
<P>
During the assault, section chiefs and janitors alike beamed with pride at the 
unflickering image they broadcast across the fearful nation. In the face of 
rumors and threats, the reassuring voices on television maintained the momentum 
of the revolt. 
</P>
<P>
Unlikely heroes emerged in the heat of battle. Marin Constantin, who edited 
youth programs, took it upon himself to make sure the eighth-floor occupants 
made it through the night. 
</P>
<P>
When the shooting started, he herded everyone into a central hallway protected 
from ricochets by a double layer of walls. When he found no other way to 
extinguish the grilled ceiling light, he deftly smashed it with a chair. 
</P>
<P>
When the heavy fighting began, his grin broadened, comforting others whose 
thoughts were beginning to rattle them. To amuse the company, he sang an old 
national hymn that was almost forgotten during Ceausescu's reign. 
</P>
<P>
It went, "Wake up, Romania, from the mortal sleep into which you have been 
lulled by the evil tyrant." 
</P>
<P>
The song, broadcast earlier in the day over the battered transmitters, seemed 
to fit Free Romania Television.

<P>
What better way to end a decade already dubbed "The Greed Decade" than by 
closing out with record prices for radio stations? 
</P>
<P>
Group W finalized a mega-deal this month to buy eight stations from 
Legacy/Metropolitan Broadcasting (including KTWV-FM "The Wave" in Los Angeles) 
for a reported $385 million. With the acquisition, believed to be the largest 
all-radio transaction ever, Group W -- which already owned 14 stations, 
including all-news KFWB-AM in Los Angeles -- becomes the second-largest owner 
of radio stations in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
And Viacom International, heretofore best known as a film producer and TV 
program syndicator, shelled out $101.5 million in November for an AM/FM 
combination in Denver and Los Angeles radio station KJOI-FM. The Southern 
California Broadcasters Assn. estimated the KJOI portion of the purchase to be 
in the $80-million to $90-million range. 
</P>
<P>
The history of KJOI's change in ownership and its steadily rising price tag 
dramatically illustrate what went on in the radio world during the '80s. The 
station had sold for $18.5 million in 1983 and $44 million in 1986 before 
Command Communications paid $79 million for the highly rated station in June, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Big price tags and frequent ownership changes show that radio has been 
rediscovered by Wall Street. Investors doled out more than $3 billion for 
stations in 1988, up 50% from the previous year's dollar volume. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a real interesting 10 years for radio," said "New Age" KTWV 
general manager Allan Chlowitz, who started out the decade as general manager 
of "Oldies" KRTH-FM. In the 30 months he has been at the helm of "The Wave" -- 
the only genuinely new music format to emerge in the '80s, Chlowitz has seen 
the station bought and sold three times. In less than a decade, he has watched 
prices for an FM station escalate from a little more than $10 million "to the 
mid-$80s. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anybody could have predicted those kind of numbers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Deregulation seems to have inspired new investors and prompted renewed interest 
in radio. The buying and selling frenzy -- more than 1,000 of the nation's 
9,000 commercial FM and AM radio stations changed hands in 1988 -- has been 
spurred by the Federal Communications Commission's deregulation of the 
airwaves, which loosened restrictions on ownership, and by Wall Street's 
heightened interest in radio as an investment. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 the FCC increased the maximum number of radio stations that can be held 
by a single owner to 24 (12 FM and 12 AM) from 14. Risk could now be spread 
over more stations. And in 1982 the commission also eliminated an 
anti-trafficking rule that required broadcasters to own a station for at least 
three years before selling it. 
</P>
<P>
"When they took the trafficking rule away and let people buy and sell quickly 
it escalated and got the Wall Street banking community involved," Chlowitz 
said. "It opened up another game to play. . . . It's gone wild." 
</P>
<P>
"Because the three-year rule went away, it's more of a real estate business," 
said media consultant Jeff Pollack. 
</P>
<P>
Funds are increasingly available from Wall Street now to finance the 
multimillion-dollar deals, radio analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street began to show real interest in radio acquisition with 1986's 
initial public stock offering of Infinity Broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles the "stick" value (or average price) of a radio station is said 
to be between $56 million and $86 million, based on sales of stations that 
occurred this year. And the trend of high prices is expected to continue into 
the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, top value will continue to be paid in L.A.," Chlowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
However, in the process of becoming highly profitable, radio has gone from 
being entertainment to serious business. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of price tags being paid, all of a sudden there's enormous pressure to 
really get the business to pay off all these debt services, so now it's not as 
friendly as it used to be," said Bill Sommers, KLOS-FM's general manager. 
"Radio is strictly a business, it's not fun anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Whole media companies are concentrating on radio and making it their primary 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Infinity Broadcasting, based in New York, is one of a handful of media chains 
that specializes in radio ownership exclusively. Some of the other notables are 
Legacy Broadcasting of Los Angeles and Noble Broadcast Group in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, many stations were family-run businesses . 
</P>
<P>
"It was mom and pop until about 5 years ago," said Pat Clawson, trade magazine 
Radio and Records' Washington-based financial editor. Now, savvy operators 
brimming with business acumen are running stations, many with little or no 
affinity to or background in music. Rather, they are relying increasingly on 
market research to help them develop their programming strategies and play 
lists. 
</P>
<P>
"I think now radio is less seat-of-the-pants than it's ever been," said John 
Dobel, Western regional manager of Birch Scarborough Ratings Service. "I think 
it's a better business now than it was in the beginning of the decade. . . . 
There's more money being invested in radio stations today. There's more 
research being used. There's a better understanding of what the product is." 
</P>
<P>
Said KJOI vice president and general manager Bob Griffith: "Research now plays 
a large role in programming decisions. This is not a fly-by-night business 
anymore. We changed our format (from "beautiful music" to soft hits) and we 
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in research to make sure we were doing 
it correctly, and we will continue to spend that kind of money to make sure 
we're on the right track. You can't do things seat of the pants anymore. . . . 
You can't take an $85-million product and play with it." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, creativity and experimentation were on the wane during the '80s when 
tried-and-true formats predominated. 
</P>
<P>
"The '80s were an uninspired decade from the creative standpoint," Pollack 
said. "But they were profitable. Because of the economic realities, it's 
difficult to have a free-wheeling, experimental, entrepreneurial spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, market research concepts such as focus groups and song testing 
are being utilized, and such terms as psychographics and demographics are being 
bandied about by programmers and station owners. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point is KKBT, the new "urban rock" station that rose from the ashes 
of Los Angeles' only commercial classical station, KFAC, which played its last 
waltz in September. KFAC was purchased by Evergreen Media Corp. in January for 
$55 million, a record price for a classical music station. When Evergreen took 
over early in 1989, it spent more than six months researching formats and 
planning its debut. 
</P>
<P>
Its general manager announced that he wanted his station to "identically mirror 
the demographic and psychographic make-up of L.A." The potential audience was 
surveyed and each song on the play list was tested and chosen to appeal to 60% 
females, 40% males and a wide spectrum of ethnic groups within the ages of 
25-44. 
</P>
<P>
One-and-a-half million dollars was spent on programming, including music 
testing, consultants' fees and focus group research. Much of the budget -- $2 
million -- was spent on advance advertising and publicity. One million dollars 
was spent on billboards. 
</P>
<P>
Before KKBT's debut was the celebrated entrance of KQLZ, or "Pirate Radio," 
which spent a small fortune blitzing Southern California with billboards and 
advance publicity. New York super-deejay and programming wiz Scott Shannon 
shrewdly filled a gap in local radio by playing an eclectic mix of rock and 
heavy metal and the station shot up to the Top 5 within three months of its 
debut. 
</P>
<P>
While more money is spent on the acquisition of radio stations, more money is 
being made on radio through advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising revenues are at an all-time high, hitting $8.2 billion nationally 
in 1989, an 8% increase over last year's $7.7 billion. Revenue growth has a 
direct bearing on station prices because stations are valued according to cash 
flow rather than assets. 
</P>
<P>
And revenues in Los Angeles -- the nation's No. 1 market for ad billings -- 
have risen markedly throughout the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Each year Los Angeles ad revenues have broken new records, topping the previous 
year's totals by significant sums. Los Angeles radio ad revenues are 
significantly above last year and are expected to exceed the $385-million mark 
in 1989, up from $353 million for 1988. The first six months of 1989 were the 
highest in history, according to J. Rae Padden, vice president of Radio 
Advertising Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the biggest gains in money spent on radio advertising nationally 
included banks and savings and loans, whose radio advertising increased by 199% 
since 1980. Automobile dealers' ads jumped 183% since 1980. Grocery stores and 
supermarket advertising grew by 173% since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Another factor that has contributed to the new-found success of radio as a 
business venture is the increased number of listeners in cities such as Los 
Angeles plagued with traffic and congestion. The majority of people listen to 
radio in their cars. Those trapped in traffic jams are captive audiences for 
radio, said Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
"All you have to do is look at those freeways at quarter to 5," Griffith said. 
"Every traffic jam is an opportunity to a broadcaster. You're dealing with a 
medium that has very much a captive audience in the automobile. It's bordering 
on the oppressive." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the number of cars on the road has grown substantially from 1980, and 
the number of radio listeners has grown along with it. In Los Angeles County 
alone there were 729,964 more cars registered in 1989 than in 1980, bringing 
the total to nearly 4.5 million on the road. In addition to more cars on the 
road, people are traveling more miles. At the beginning of the decade drivers 
collectively traveled about 45 billion miles on Los Angeles County roads. In 
1989 that figure had ballooned to 70 billion miles. 
</P>
<P>
Each day radio is said to reach an estimated 80% of all Americans and the use 
of radio has grown by 16% since 1980, from 456.2 million radios in use in 1980 
to 527.4 million being used in 1988. Radio sales have also gone up 47% between 
1980 and 1988, from 50.4 million to 73.9 million sold. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles the stakes are particularly high: 82 stations vie for the ears 
of several million people. As the population grows, the number of stations 
stays fairly steady. "You're dealing with an intense supply and demand," 
Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
"You're talking about massively appreciating assets," Griffith said "You're not 
talking about walking away with a couple million in profit. You're talking 
about massive profits." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, despite the atmosphere of deregulation and loosened restrictions, 
the late '80s were also a time in which the FCC exerted a greater degree of 
control over programming content than in previous decades, particularly in the 
realm of decency in broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989 several broadcasters were fined thousands of dollars for allowing disc 
jockeys to play sexually suggestive songs deemed indecent or discuss the 
"depiction or description of a sexual or excretory organ or activity in a 
manner that violates contemporary community standards." 
</P>
<P>
As the "shock jock" phenomenon became increasingly widespread during the latter 
half of the decade, objectionable material seemed to irk the FCC more and more. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're getting into more regulation than we've had in a long time," 
Pollack said. "The thing we have most to fear is the FCC looking to prevent the 
creativity that makes radio such a wonderful medium." 
</P>
<P>
Pollack cited the endorsement of one-third of the country's senators applauding 
FCC Chairman Al Sikes' efforts to crack down on "indecent" broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
"The decade has ended up on a very chilling note," Pollack said. "As the 
freedom in Eastern Europe sends a wave of exhilaration, it looks like we're 
going in the reverse direction here with decency."

TV TABOOS, PROGRAM STANDARDS CHANGE WITH VALUES; 
</P>
<P>
BROADCASTING: TV IN THE '80S BECAME MORE FRANK ABOUT SEXUAL ISSUES AND GREW 
LESS TOLERANT OF DEPICTIONS OF SMOKING, ALCOHOL AND DRUGS, REFLECTING NEW 
ATTITUDES.

<P>
In 1989, ABC's "thirtysomething" ventured into uncharted waters when it showed 
a gay couple together in bed. Alfred Schneider, the network's vice president of 
policy and standards, acknowledged that the scene would not have been shown a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1989, while the gay relationship passed muster, the scene might not have 
aired had that same couple carelessly smoked a few packs of cigarettes or 
gotten drunk without identifying a designated driver. 
</P>
<P>
Although program-standards executives at the Big Three networks say there 
exists no tidy list of taboo words, scenes or subjects for TV programs now vs. 
1980, they acknowledge that TV's last decade has certainly reflected changes in 
American society: more openness about sexual issues and less tolerance of 
substance abuse. 
</P>
<P>
While American TV has brought homosexuality, incest, child abuse, rape and 
family violence, and sexually transmitted disease out of the closet in the 
'80s, TV began to say no to depictions of casual drinking and smoking, drunk 
driving and drug abuse toward the end of the 1980s -- and that trend may 
continue in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, even a comedy such as NBC's "Cheers," set in a Boston bar, might not 
have made it to the air had the concept been proposed in 1990 instead of 1982 
-- even though the show avoids depicting drunkenness or using it for humor. "If 
that idea came up now, there would be all of this societal noise in the back, 
saying: 'Aren't you going to encourage drinking with this show?' " said Alan 
Gerson, NBC vice president of program standards and marketing policy. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Bressan, vice president and assistant to the president of the CBS 
Broadcast Group, agreed. "You're not going to have a martini-drinking dog today 
like you would have in the days of (the 1950s series) 'Topper,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
Bressan added that the networks have also become more sensitive to violence and 
sexual and ethnic stereotyping during the last decade. "It's not a question of 
how we've changed, it's a question of what's now acceptable to the mass 
audience," she said. "We're not leading the charge. If in 1990 certain things 
are judged less offensive than they were before, it's because they are used 
more and more in society, and we change too." 
</P>
<P>
ABC's Schneider said that the networks have become more open and frank about 
sexuality than in years past. For example, that network's "War and Remembrance" 
included some frontal nudity last season -- but only within the context of the 
horrors of the concentration camps. "I think the televising of 'War and 
Remembrance' and the manner in which the victims of the Holocaust were depicted 
would have been more difficult 10 years ago, but that's hindsight -- it depends 
on the vehicle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's Gerson, however, noted that while such shows as "thirtysomething," "L.A. 
Law," "Hill Street Blues" and "St. Elsewhere" broke ground with frank sexual 
situations and language in the 1980s, purely salacious or shocking material is 
on the wane -- partly as a result of last season's outcry from viewers and 
advertisers over titillating shows such as NBC's "Nightingales." 
</P>
<P>
"We do let people say hell and damn and bastard, but we are making perhaps a 
stronger effort than a few years ago to cut back on that," Gerson said. "It 
ought to be reserved for the times when to use anything else would ring false. 
We're very sensitive to the sociological phenomenon of the baby boomers coming 
of age -- now they're parents; they're watching TV with their children." 
</P>
<P>
Bressan added that a sophisticated adult program such as "L.A. Law" may get by 
with an occasional goddamn, and that last season's "Lonesome Dove" miniseries 
tried to remain true to Larry McMurtry's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by 
including a horse named Hellbitch and the word poke to refer to sexual 
intercourse. Theatrical movies often include some profanity when aired on the 
network, she said, because many viewers have already seen the film and would 
find the cuts too jarring. 
</P>
<P>
But, she added, CBS makes no attempt to reflect society's increasing use of 
profanity in its own shows, or to compete with cable in that respect. "We don't 
allow (cable) to loosen our judgments," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Standards executives say that occasionally a societal issue, such as the AIDS 
crisis of the '80s, provides the catalyst for more frankness. AIDS triggered 
the networks' decision to allow condom advertising, as well as open discussion 
of how the disease is transmitted and prevented on programs ranging from 
sitcoms to "The CBS Schoolbreak Special." 
</P>
<P>
"Television has not ignored this issue," said Gerson. "I think in other times 
in our society's development and maturity, AIDS would have been ignored because 
it's a sexually transmitted disease." 
</P>
<P>
Possibly as an offshoot of TV's challenge to educate society about AIDS, 
Bressan and others noted a shift during the '80s away from "disease of the 
week" to more political or controversial made-for-TV movies including "Roe vs. 
Wade" on abortion and "The Burning Bed," about an abused wife who strikes back. 
"We might present a very graphic and dramatic adult scene in the case of 
something like acquaintance rape, based on the time period and the audience 
composition," Bressan said. 
</P>
<P>
"As good broadcasters, we have to deal with important issues and topics; it's 
our responsibility not just to entertain, but to inform."

U.S. AGENTS JOIN WESTWOOD FIRE PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN and KRISTINA LINDGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
A dozen local and federal arson investigators began digging through still-hot 
rubble Tuesday to determine the source of a mysterious explosion that ignited a 
series of major fires in Westwood last weekend, which officials now estimate 
caused at least $25 million damage. 
</P>
<P>
The predawn blaze hopscotched along the Wilshire Corridor and into nearby 
neighborhoods, damaging 15 luxury condominium complexes and houses. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, $25 million is a conservative estimate," said Los Angeles Deputy 
Fire Chief Craig G. Drummond, who supervised efforts to contain the 
conflagration, which was one of the worst in the city's history. "Literally, it 
could be well beyond that because we'll probably never know about the value of 
people's personal effects lost in the fire." 
</P>
<P>
Many residents returning to their fire-charred homes to retrieve valuables 
cited losses of irreplaceable paintings, artifacts, antique furniture and 
first-edition 19th-Century books, as well as recent home improvement projects 
in the $1-million range. 
</P>
<P>
An indication of just how high damages could soar among the wealthy residents 
could be found in the recent sale of art belonging to fabled film director 
Billy Wilder, a longtime resident of the heavily damaged Wilshire Terrace 
apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Wilder auctioned much of the contemporary art collection he 
had kept in his apartment, which suffered heavy smoke damage in the blaze. The 
auction brought $32.6 million. By contrast, the total damage at the massive 
First Interstate Bank high-rise fire in 1988 was $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
It was midday Tuesday before arson investigators were able to begin sifting 
through the debris left at the Devonhill Condominiums, where the fire started 
early Saturday. They were assisted by agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms who have special training in investigating explosive 
fires. So far no physical evidence of arson has been found, but the 
investigation is expected to take at least two days. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the fire erupted after a loud explosion inside the four-story 
luxury condominium construction site that had been scheduled to open in April. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were focusing on the central area of the unfinished building as a 
possible starting point of the fire. The elevator doors had collapsed inward 
into the shafts, according to a construction company foreman at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Whipped by winds, the showering fireballs and red-hot cinders ignited four 
additional blazes over several blocks and led to the greatest mobilization for 
a building fire in the city's history. Although no serious injuries were 
reported, the fires routed 150 people from their residences. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief Dean Cathey said Tuesday that the federal arson team, which has 
a mobile laboratory that can test for explosives, had been called in for 
assistance "because of the amount of debris and damage and the concern that 
there may have been some foul play involved in the fire." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Devonshire Associates, the developer of the Devonhill project, said 
that their clients knew of no motives for arson. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a substantial number of small lawsuits against the project," 
acknowledged attorney Richard Gesch of Maui. "But they were very negligible." 
The suits, according to Los Angeles Superior Court records, involved efforts by 
several concrete subcontractors to collect payments allegedly due them from 
another subcontractor. 
</P>
<P>
Gesch said Devonshire's president, Jean Pierre Chavy, a retired Singapore bank 
president, was "in tears" as a result of the fire. Chavy, he said, had signed a 
personal guarantee with a bank to repay the loan for the luxury building 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Montgomery, crew foreman for Charter Construction Co., which is the general 
contractor for the 17-unit Devonhill complex, added that he knew of no labor 
problems at the construction site. "There was no big layoff and there wasn't a 
big layoff planned. One or two (people) may have gone, but there have been no 
problems that I'm aware of -- nothing out of the ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the 14-story Wilshire Terrace, located just west of the Devonhill 
construction site, were told Tuesday that they will be unable to return home 
for anywhere from 10 days to six months. During that time, extensive repairs 
will be made to the building's electrical power system. A total of 22 units -- 
including one owned by actress Greer Garson, who was away at the time -- were 
destroyed or severely damaged in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish the building would have had fire sprinklers. We would have saved many 
millions of dollars of destruction had the building been sprinklered," Drummond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the 30-year-old apartment cooperative had discussed installing a 
sprinkler system, at an estimated cost of about $1 million, during the last 
year, a building management official said Tuesday. But no vote was ever taken 
by the cooperative's nine-member board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"They always wanted to do what was the safest thing," said Jon D. Waldron, 
assistant vice president for the George Elkins Co., which manages Wilshire 
Terrace. "I can guarantee you . . . they will do it (now)." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents across the street at the three-story French Normandy-style 
Devonshire apartment complex Tuesday were critical of the Fire Department's 
response time. Building owner Eleanore Heller, 58, who arrived at the scene 
about 40 minutes after the initial explosion, said she was troubled that none 
of the firefighters were concentrating efforts on her burning building, which 
was essentially destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
"Can't you save it? Can't you save it?" she said she asked firefighters early 
Saturday. "They said, 'No, we don't have enough manpower.' 
</P>
<P>
". . . Maybe their priority was to contain the high-rise fire. But maybe there 
should have been more manpower." 
</P>
<P>
Drummond, however, said the Fire Department responded as quickly as possible 
under trying circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"It was what we call a 'career fire,' " he said. "They don't get any more 
demanding, and I don't think any better job could have been done fighting this 
fire." 
</P>

SPECIAL LAW PUT TO TEST IN CASE OF FETUS DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: PROSECUTORS SAY ASSAULT ON WOMAN KILLED HER UNBORN BABY. THEY'RE 
EVOKING A RARELY USED STATUTE TO DEMAND A PUNISHMENT THAT FITS THE CRIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In the darkness of her one-room flat, Valerie Morales' dreams are haunted by 
memories of the baby boy she always wanted and almost had. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the time," she said, "I try not to think about it. I just try to 
forget, but sometimes I'll be lying down, nothing to do, the kids are all 
asleep. I'll just start thinking about it and getting real sad." 
</P>
<P>
Since late August, the dream has come "over and over" again, Morales said, and 
it is always the same. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, she is being beaten. "In the end it would be me dying, I was 
still pregnant, and the baby dying," Morales said. 
</P>
<P>
Her former boyfriend, Jose Alfredo Velasco, 25, faces charges for allegedly 
beating Morales on Aug. 20 -- when she was four months pregnant -- and 
intentionally causing the death of her fetus, which died a week after the 
beating. 
</P>
<P>
Because Morales was only 17 to 18 weeks pregnant, murder charges cannot be 
filed. So prosecutors say they have turned to a little-used "fetus death" 
statute to make sure that, in a case like this, the punishment fits the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys say the law -- which increases the penalty for crimes in which a 
fetus is killed -- has been used so rarely because its stringency makes it 
difficult to obtain a conviction. But they feel the Morales case provides an 
opportunity to put the law to the test. 
</P>
<P>
Instituted in 1985, the law came about as a result of a similar case in 1983, 
when a 14-year-old girl, who also was four months pregnant, was stabbed and her 
fetus killed. Because the girl was not further along in her pregnancy, murder 
charges could not be filed. Under California law, unless a fetus is considered 
viable -- able to survive outside the womb -- murder charges cannot be brought. 
Doctors say a fetus is usually considered viable after 24 weeks, though the age 
can vary. 
</P>
<P>
Since the murder statute did not apply, the girl's attacker was convicted of 
assault with a deadly weapon and was sentenced to six years in prison. No 
specific charge was filed for the death of the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
A bill sponsored by Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) changed that. 
</P>
<P>
The statute allows for a special allegation that adds an extra five years to a 
felony sentence if a crime committed against a pregnant woman results in the 
loss of a non-viable fetus. 
</P>
<P>
McClintock said he sponsored the measure because of the "frustration" 
prosecutors felt at not being able to enter a charge with a stiffer penalty in 
the 1983 case. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the bill was to give prosecutors the ability to seek an 
enhancement when a crime is committed that warrants more than a charge of great 
bodily injury," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco, who has pleaded not guilty and is free on $12,000 bail, faces a charge 
of assault with a deadly weapon causing great bodily injury in the beating of 
Morales, plus the special allegation made possible by the statute change. A 
trial date will be set at a hearing scheduled for Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Morales testified at an earlier court hearing that Velasco, the father of her 
two surviving children, both girls, punched and kicked her repeatedly in the 
stomach as she lay on the floor in a neighbor's house. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview and in testimony, Morales alleged that the beating was prompted 
by an argument between Velasco and her current boyfriend -- the father of her 
unborn child. Morales said Velasco had discovered she was pregnant and wanted 
her to have an abortion. She refused. 
</P>
<P>
When she intervened in the fight between the two men, she said, Velasco turned 
on her. 
</P>
<P>
"We were arguing about me not wanting to be with him and about me being 
pregnant from somebody else," she testified. 
</P>
<P>
But the argument soon turned into a physical altercation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I broke the window to his car, then he started chasing me," Morales said in 
the interview. "He chased me to my next-door neighbor's house, and that's where 
he got me on the couch and he held my arms like this," she said, placing her 
arms behind her back as if she were about to be handcuffed. 
</P>
<P>
During the preliminary hearing, Morales told of "trying to get away from" 
Velasco by running to the kitchen of her neighbor's house. In a separate 
interview, Morales said she was repeatedly beaten and kicked and that, at one 
point during the ordeal, Velasco told her that "I wasn't going to have a baby 
from somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
A week after the alleged beating, Morales was rushed to California Hospital in 
Southwest Los Angeles with hemorrhaging and severe pain in the abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
"They told me that the baby was dead and that it was from him beating me up," 
she said, noting that she had told doctors of the alleged beating. "They made 
me have the baby like I was having one naturally. I went through that for one 
whole day. I just felt bad, then they told me it was a boy. I wanted a boy." 
</P>
<P>
If found guilty in the case, Velasco faces nine to 12 years in prison, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. David Campbell. Without the special allegation, he would 
face between four and seven years for assault with a deadly weapon and causing 
great bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors were hesitant to discuss the Velasco case in detail. But several 
noted that it is one of the few cases to proceed this far since the law was 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think an important factor is that it's only been around four years and 
there's not been that many opportunities to file . . ." Campbell said of the 
law. "I assume that if the factors were there (in previous cases) we'd file." 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Norm Shapiro, who works in the Complaints Division of 
the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, noted that the law has been 
rarely used because of its limitations. 
</P>
<P>
For the special allegation to be applied, the suspect had to have known that 
the woman was pregnant and then intentionally caused the death of the fetus. 
Shapiro said it is especially difficult to prove that a person knew a woman was 
pregnant and meant to kill the fetus. He noted that many women do not appear to 
be pregnant early in their pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Velasco knew Morales was pregnant and intended to cause her to lose her 
baby will be key factors during the trial, Velasco's defense attorney has 
indicated. 
</P>
<P>
Another difficulty in this type of case, attorneys say, is proving that the 
crime committed against the mother was actually the cause of the fetus's death. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Sobel, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union in Los Angeles 
who has done a great deal of work in reproductive rights cases, also noted that 
it is extremely difficult -- even in cases in which a woman is beaten -- to 
prove the cause of a fetus's death given the number of spontaneous fetal 
abortions resulting from inadequate prenatal care or other health factors, such 
as venereal disease. 
</P>
<P>
A doctor's testimony is a key factor in these cases, but doctors are often 
hesitant to testify to the cause of a fetus's death, said one official in the 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"We would have to have a doctor's report say to us that the termination of this 
pregnancy was a direct result of this beating," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tina Koopersmith, who attended Morales on the day she went into the 
hospital, testified that the beating appeared to cause the baby's death, but 
that she could not say for certain because she did not perform the autopsy. She 
also said she could not rule out other possible causes of death. 
</P>
<P>
Velasco's attorney, Public Defender Stanley Shimotsu, also has declined to 
discuss the case in detail. But during the earlier court hearing, he said there 
may be "other medical causes that brought about the termination (of the 
pregnancy) that superseded the injuries caused by my client." 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination, Morales testified that about five to seven weeks 
before the beating she was "jumped" by four girls who beat her for about five 
minutes as she crouched on the sidewalk. Shimotsu also indicated that the delay 
of one week between the alleged beating and the death of the fetus also will be 
addressed in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination, Koopersmith testified Morales may have endangered the 
life of the baby by not going to the hospital sooner. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the hearing, Shimotsu said, "This (case) is different in 
terms of its complexity," adding his investigation is continuing.

LOS ANGELES COUNTY'S 86 CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Cecilia Rasmussen, Times Researcher 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles was the first city in the county to incorporate -- in 1850 -- with 
Diamond Bar trailing 139 years later, to become the 86th city earlier this 
year. Here is how each community was named and the date of its incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
Lancaster (1977) -- Founded in 1876 by M. L. Wicks of Aberdeen, Miss., and 
named by officials of the Southern Pacific Railway, presumably for Lancaster, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
Lawndale (1959) -- Once known as Lawndale Acres and nicknamed "Billy Goat 
Acres," this community was established and named by Charles Hopper in 1905. It 
may have been named for the green grass in the area, which was once a swamp. 
</P>
<P>
Lomita (1964) -- A surveyor's map of Rancho San Pedro mentions a Lomita del 
Toro, meaning "Little Bull Hill," just a few miles east of the present-day 
city. In 1907, the W. I. Hollingsworth Company founded the town, once known as 
the celery capital of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach (1897) -- Known in 1882 as Willmore City, after English developer 
William Erwin Willmore, who brought immigrants from Kansas City. When too few 
buyers appeared, his plans collapsed. In 1887 the Long Beach Land &amp; Water 
Co. took over and gave the community its present name, chosen because of the 
size of the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles (1850) -- Given its name from the Los Angeles River by members of 
the Gaspar de Portola expedition, who camped on the east bank of the river on 
Aug. 2, 1769, and named the river El Rio Nuestra Senora la Reina de los Angeles 
de Porciuncula, or "the River of Our Lady Queen of the Angels of Porciuncula." 
Porciuncula in Italy is the cradle of the Franciscan order, whose priests 
accompanied the expedition. 
</P>
<P>
Lynwood (1921) -- Named for Lynn Wood Sessions, wife of a dairyman who operated 
the Lynwood dairy. 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan Beach (1912) -- Formerly known as Shore Acres, this community was 
founded and named by Stewart Merrill in 1902, after New York's famous island. 
</P>
<P>
Maywood (1924) -- The district was christened Maywood in 1919. Records indicate 
that it may have been named for May Wood, an employee of the Laguna-Bell Land 
Company, which developed 27,027 acres of Rancho San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovia (1887) -- Named for William Newton Monroe, pioneer and railroad 
builder, who purchased 240 acres from Lucky Baldwin for $30,000 in 1875. Monroe 
always told his friends how to reach the ranch via Myrtle Street (named for his 
wife). 
</P>
<P>
Montebello (1920) -- Harris Newmark purchased the 5,000-acre Repetta Ranch in 
1886 and subdivided 1,500 acres of it in 1900 to create Montebello and Newmark 
(which was later absorbed by Montebello). Montebello means "beautiful hills" 
and was once the site of California's richest oil fields -- which made Newmark 
a fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park (1916) -- The name was suggested by Thomas A. Berkible, the 
community's first city attorney, for the bay of the same name. Explorer 
Sebastian Vizcaino named the bay for his superior, the Count of Monterey, 
Gaspar de Zuniga y Acevedo. 
</P>
<P>
Norwalk (1957) -- At times known as New River, Seven Sycamores, Sycamore Grove 
and Corazon de los Valles (Heart of the Valleys), this community was renamed in 
1877 by the Southern Pacific Railroad. Its tracks crossed the "north walk" 
along the route from "Anaheim landing." But the town also could have been named 
for Norwalk, Conn., the former home of a railroad official. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale (1962) -- Founded by a group of German Lutherans in 1886, who called 
their town "Palmenthal." It stems from the Joshua trees that cover the valley 
floor and that were frequently referred to as palms. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes Estates (1939) -- The name is derived from Canada de los Palos 
Verdes (valley of green trees). The valley lies between what is now the Harbor 
Freeway and Figueroa Street, south of Sepulveda Boulevard. The western part of 
the Rancho Sepulveda, it was subdivided by Jay Lawyer and Frank Vanderlip in 
1922. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount (1957) -- The name, after the motion picture company, was suggested 
by Frank Zamboni, president of the Kiwanis Club, around 1948. Paramount 
Boulevard was the main street between the former communities of Hynes and 
Clearwater, which merged after many years of "fence-straddling." 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena (1886) -- The English hybrid of two Chippewa Indian words, 
pass-ka-mi-gra (valley) and pig-wa-dena (hill). Hence, a "valley between 
hills." Named by Dr. Thomas Balch Elliott of the San Gabriel Orange Grove 
Assn., which bought 3,962 acres of Rancho San Pascual for $25,000 in 1874. 
</P>
<P>
Pico Rivera (1958) -- Formed when two towns became one. Pico was named after 
Pio Pico, the last governor of California under Mexican rule. The northern part 
of the city, Rivera, was so named because it was between two rivers: the Rio 
Hondo and the San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona (1888) -- Named by nurseryman Solomon Gates, who won a town lot as a 
prize for suggesting its name. His inspiration: the Roman goddess of fruit and 
fruit trees. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Palos Verdes (1973) -- Once owned by Juan Jose Dominguez as part of an 
18th-Century land grant, by the early 1800s much of this land was in the 
possession of a youth named Jose Dolores Sepulveda, who called his land the 
Rancho de los Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach (1892) -- Developed in 1887 as a seaside resort and named after 
the adjacent Rancho Sausal Redondo, which means "round willow grove." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills (1957) -- This elite haven on a hill was once part of Rancho El 
Elastico, owned by architect and developer A. E. Hanson. In Hanson's book 
"Rolling Hills: The Early Years," he said he had planned to call the area 
"Folded Hills" but changed his mind after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills Estates (1957) -- Also part of Rancho El Elastico. The area is 
home to many Thoroughbred race horses. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemead (1959) -- Meaning "Rose's Meadow," this community was named in honor 
of Leonard J. Rose, a celebrated vintner and horse breeder. He was most famous 
for his Sunnyslope ranch in the Pasadena-San Marino area. 
</P>
<P>
San Dimas (1960) -- Formerly known as Mud Springs and later named for St. 
Dismas, the good thief crucified with Jesus Christ. Reportedly, the name was 
given to San Dimas Canyon by Don Ignacio Palomares, owner of Rancho San Jose, 
because the canyon was home to many cattle rustlers and horse thieves. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando (1911) -- Seventeenth of the Franciscan missions, founded Sept. 8, 
1797, and named for St. Ferdinand III, king of Leon and Castile. Described as a 
brave soldier, he is credited with having struck the blow that ended Spain's 
rule of Seville and Cordova. 
</P>
<P>
San Gabriel (1913) -- Named for the Archangel Gabriel, one of the seven 
archangels of God. The 1769 Portola expedition named this area after St. 
Michael, and for some years it was known as San Miguel de los Temblores because 
of the many earthquakes in the area. 
</P>
<P>
San Marino (1913) -- Originally the home of J. DeBarth Shorb, son-in-law of Don 
Benito, the founder of Alhambra. San Marino was the name of Shorb's boyhood 
home in Maryland, which was taken taken from San Marino, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita (1987) -- The river that flows through the area to the Pacific 
Ocean was given the name Santa Clara by the Portola expedition. The same name 
belongs to another larger California river, so, to avoid confusion, the area 
around this river was called Santa Clarita, or "Little Santa Clara." The city 
consists of the communities of Newhall, Saugus, Valencia and Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe Springs (1957) -- Known in 1873 as Fulton Sulphur Springs and Health 
Resort after J. E. Fulton, this land was purchased in 1886 by the Santa Fe 
Railway and renamed for that company and the nearby mineral springs. Developer 
Alphonzo Bell struck oil there in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica (1886) -- Named by Franciscan father Junipero Serra of the Portola 
expedition on May 4, 1770, the feast day of St. Monica. It is said that the 
group had camped near a spring that reminded the padre of the tears that St. 
Monica shed over her son, St. Augustine. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Madre (1907) -- The name means "mother range" or "mother mountains." One 
story has it that the town was named by Nathaniel C. Carter when he subdivided 
1,100 acres of Rancho Santa Anita in 1881. However, the padres called the 
mountains the Sierra Madre because nearby ranges seemed to spring from them. 
They were officially dubbed the San Gabriel Mountains in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
Signal Hill (1924) -- In the mission days, this hill was used as a lookout and 
signal point; earlier, the Puvas Indians used signal fires from this point to 
warn of danger. 
</P>
<P>
South El Monte (1958) -- When the El Monte boundaries were drawn in 1912, the 
farmland farther south of it was left out. It was known as the "hub of the 
valley," and residents eventually realized its potential in developing it into 
an industrial city. 
</P>
<P>
South Gate (1923) -- Formerly the south gate entrance to Rancho San Antonio. 
Much of this land -- 29,513-acres -- was owned in 1883 by Jonathan S. Slauson, 
but was sold by his heirs in 1910 for $500 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
South Pasadena (1888) -- When Pasadena began a drive to incorporate -- largely 
as a way to regulate the sale of liquor and eliminate saloons -- South Pasadena 
became the refuge of the outlawed establishments. The town began an advertising 
campaign touting prohibitionist leanings in an attempt to attract teetotaling 
citizenry. South Pasadena thus became California's second bone-dry city. 
</P>
<P>
Temple City (1960) -- Founded in 1922 by Walter Paul Temple -- nephew of John 
Temple, who built the Temple block in Los Angeles where City Hall stands, and 
son of Francis Pliny Fisk Temple, banker and owner of 200,000 acres in the San 
Gabriel Valley. Walter Temple subdivided 400 acres of the land, which had been 
part of Lucky Baldwin's Rancho Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance (1921) -- Named for Jared Sidney Torrance, a financier and 
philanthropist who came to California in 1887 and who, much later, founded the 
community as a site for the Union Tool Co. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon (1905) -- Known in 1871 as Vernondale, for Captain George R. Vernon, one 
of the first settlers and a Civil War hero. 
</P>
<P>
Walnut (1959) -- Originally this land was part of Rancho Los Nogales, or the 
"ranch of walnut trees." Until 1912 the town was called Lemon because the post 
office was on Lemon Road, but the name reportedly was changed because Lemon 
just didn't seem serious enough. 
</P>
<P>
West Covina (1923) -- Originally an agricultural town with many walnut and 
orange groves. When the citizens learned that Covina wanted to build a sewage 
dump just south of the freeway on Glendora Avenue, West Covina immediately took 
steps to incorporate. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood (1984) -- Hollywood was laid out and named by Horace H. Wilcox. 
Apparently, Mrs. Wilcox heard the name during a trip east and liked it so much 
that her husband imported two holly trees to justify the name. Unfortunately, 
the trees did not survive in the warm climate. West Hollywood has had its name 
since about 1920, and was finally incorporated because the citizens wanted rent 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake Village (1981) -- This land was owned in the 1920s by William Randolph 
Hearst, but he sold it when he found out it had no oil. Westlake Village was 
built on the west side of a man-made lake. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier (1898) -- Originally a Quaker colony named after the poet John 
Greenleaf Whittier, this city is on the site of the Indian village of Sejat, 
meaning "place of wild bees."

TAXI LAW IS IDLING WHILE CITY HALL FOES GRIND THEIR GEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the Los Angeles City Council saw things last summer, the New Year would mark 
the beginning of a kinder, gentler era for taxi drivers and their passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Cabbies would adhere to a dress code that banned such items as tank tops and 
cutoff shorts. New drivers would undergo training programs and veterans would 
attend refresher courses. "Communications skills" and "passenger relations" 
would be emphasized. Neatness and cleanliness would be stressed. 
</P>
<P>
And if the reeducation efforts needed a push, a system of fines -- the city's 
first for cab drivers -- would be on the books as an added incentive. 
</P>
<P>
But the elaborate new taxi industry regulation program, approved by the City 
Council in August, is languishing in the City Hall bureaucracy. It has no 
chance of taking effect by Jan. 1 or anytime soon, city officials concede. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance that would allow the city's Department of Transportation to begin 
teaching, policing and fining cab drivers has been sitting in the council's 
Transportation Committee for months, apparently awaiting approval of a 
technical change added by the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
The situation has infuriated Mayor Tom Bradley's office and rekindled its feud 
with Councilman Nate Holden, who chairs the Transportation Committee and is a 
Bradley foe. Earlier this year, Holden was blamed for holding onto Bradley's 
rush-hour truck ban proposal, delaying it for months before sending it to the 
council for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
The taxi ordinance was a compromise worked out by Bradley's office after the 
city's Department of Transportation recommended that existing taxi franchises 
not be renewed, but be put out for open bidding. 
</P>
<P>
In return for keeping their franchises, the cabbies agreed to the new system of 
fines for infractions of a new set of rules. 
</P>
<P>
"There are several important transportation initiatives that are bottled up in 
Councilman Holden's committee, including new taxicab regulations," Deputy Mayor 
Mark Fabiani said Tuesday. "We would hope that these . . . could be moved 
forward as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Several council members and assistants familiar with the issue also blame 
Holden, who, they say, will not send the measure to the council for final 
approval because it originated with Bradley. Speaking about the situation on 
the condition that they not be quoted, they said they did not want to get into 
a public fight with Holden, who controls most transportation-related 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
Holden on Tuesday denied he was delaying the taxi regulation and blamed the 
city attorney's office and the mayor's office for the snag, saying they had 
sent him a poorly drafted ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Holden said, "If the taxi thing is in the committee, then I want 
to hear it at the next meeting." He said he plans to deal with it at a 
committee meeting in January. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the cause of the delay, the city has been losing an estimated $12,000 
in fine revenue it could be collecting each month and using to pay for taxi 
driver school.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO THEFT OF PAINTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two men charged in the theft of a 17th-Century Dutch painting from an Antelope 
Valley College art show last month have pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Jereld Sharitz, a 23-year-old art student at the college, was charged with 
grand theft. Timothy Cain, Sharitz's 27-year-old roommate, was charged as an 
accessory, a Lancaster Municipal Court official said. The $18,000 artwork, 
"Nymphs Gathering Flowers in a Landscape" by Gerard Hoet the Elder, was stolen 
from the college art gallery Nov. 6 during an exhibit of European paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Sharitz and Cain were arrested Nov. 28 after investigators acting on a tip 
served a search warrant at the apartment of the two men and found the painting. 
The suspects entered not guilty pleas Friday and face a preliminary hearing 
Jan. 11.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CRASH VICTIM IDENTIFIED AS LANCASTER MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aman who was killed on Christmas in an auto accident near Palmdale was 
identified Tuesday as Carlos Jara, 26, of Lancaster, the California Highway 
Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
Jara was killed Monday at 8:40 a.m. on California 138, about 25 miles southeast 
of Palmdale, the CHP said. The driver of the car, Clay Stoller, 24, of 
Lancaster, was in serious condition at Huntington Memorial Hospital in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP said the accident occurred when Stoller apparently tried to pass a 
slower car while going west on the highway. He pulled into the oncoming lane 
and saw a car driven by Peter Carlomagno coming in the opposite direction. Both 
autos swerved to the shoulder of the road, where they collided, the CHP said. 
Carlomagno, 27, of Escondido, was in serious condition Tuesday at Huntington 
Memorial, and his mother, Beryl Ford, 62, of Palmdale was in stable condition 
at Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center in Palmdale, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the CHP will seek vehicular manslaughter and drunk-driving 
charges against Stoller.

BRIDGES FOR IMMIGRANT CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All the passionate discussions about school overcrowding this year have pointed 
out the challenges inherent in educating California's burgeoning immigrant 
population. 
</P>
<P>
But in spite of the potential for chaos, there are a selected number of schools 
and organizations that are finding ways to make the public education system 
work for immigrant children. 
</P>
<P>
And now, with the publication of "Bridges," by the nonprofit organization 
California Tomorrow, there is a catalogue that lists the most promising of the 
state's multicultural education programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Bridges" includes several Los Angeles and Alhambra school programs that offer 
support for children making the transition to American life when they first 
arrive in this country, a model intergroup relations program offered at Irvine 
High School to students, faculty, parents and community members, and immigrant 
parent involvement programs throughout California. They are all programs that 
have proven successful. "Bridges" is a vehicle to spread the word to others who 
might want to emulate what works. 
</P>
<P>
 Not reinventing the wheel is a smart way to establish a solid educational 
foundation for the children of California's future.

HOTEL PLAN FOR MARINELAND SITE SCALED BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an attempt to win political support for a resort hotel on the former 
Marineland site in Rancho Palos Verdes, an Arizona development company says it 
is willing to cut the size of the proposed hotel by more than half if it is 
also allowed to build single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
Several city officials hailed the new proposal, saying it is a positive step 
toward developing the site. However, Councilman Robert Ryan said he is 
adamantly opposed to allowing both a hotel and homes on the property. 
</P>
<P>
The Monaghan Co., in a letter received by the city and made public, said the 
city's opposition compelled it to drop a plan to build a 1,070-room hotel in 
favor of a proposal for a 495-room hotel and 80 homes. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to abandon the initial proposal came after months of 
behind-the-scenes wrangling between city officials and the Scottsdale-based 
company, which purchased the oceanfront property in May, 1987, 90 days after 
the landmark aquatic park was closed. 
</P>
<P>
City officials repeatedly told Monaghan that a 1,070-room hotel was 
unacceptable for the 102-acre site because of increased traffic and other 
environmental problems that such a high-density project could pose. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Monaghan General Manager Phillip Marsden called the 
new proposal a "win-win situation" for the company and Rancho Palos Verdes, 
where a handful of proposed coastal projects have dominated political debate in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are trying to be responsive to (the issue of) open space," Marsden 
said, adding that the smaller hotel and the homes would generate significantly 
less traffic than the bigger hotel would. 
</P>
<P>
The company said it hopes to meet with city officials in early January to 
discuss the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Douglas Hinchliffe said the company's new proposal is a step in the 
right direction. 
</P>
<P>
Hinchliffe and Councilwoman Jacki Bacharach said they would have to study the 
new plan before commenting on it in detail. However, both said a 495-room hotel 
may still be too large for the site. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan also said the hotel may be too big, and he denounced the company's 
proposal to build homes next to it.

RITES SET FOR PIONEER LABOR LEADER MAX J. OSSLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Visitation will be Thursday for retired labor leader Max J. Osslo, who died 
Tuesday at Rancho Encinitas Convalescent Hospital. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
Osslo was secretary and business manager of Amalgamated Meat Cutters and 
Butcher Workmen Union, Local 229, from 1936 until he retired in 1982. The Meat 
Cutters merged with the Retail Clerks Union to become the United Food &amp; 
Commercial Workers in 1979. Local 229 became part of Local 135, representing 
14,000 meat employees and clerks in the San Diego County food industry. 
</P>
<P>
He also headed the Western Federation of Butchers, which represents butchers in 
the western states and he was vice president of the organization's 
international union. 
</P>
<P>
"Osslo was a dominant force in the growth and prosperity of the labor movement 
dating back to the Great Depression," said Jim McVicar, spokesman for the local 
union. 
</P>
<P>
"He was known to fellow unionists and management representatives alike as a 
tough, but fair negotiator, who would drive a hard bargain, but never back down 
on his word." 
</P>
<P>
Of all his achievements and activities, Osslo was proudest of his affiliation 
with the Meat Cutters Union, McVicar said. The union had fewer than 70 members 
in 1933 when he came to San Diego from his native Colorado and entered the 
trade. By the early '70s, the membership rolls had risen to more than 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Osslo also helped establish California's first formal training program for meat 
cutters in 1938. The program evolved into the apprenticeship program that 
exists today, McVicar said. 
</P>
<P>
He was particularly proud of his efforts in opening the union's Mission Valley 
building, which included an enclosed swimming pool for union members and youth 
groups. The pool was also used by English Channel swimmer Florence Chadwick as 
a teaching facility before it was later closed because of the expense of 
maintaining it, McVicar said. 
</P>
<P>
Osslo was also active in civic and charitable affairs until failing health 
slowed his pace in the early 1980s, McVicar said. He co-founded the San Diego 
Chapter of the Leukemia Society with his close friend and Teamsters Union 
leader, John S. Lyons, and participated in United Way campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime member of St. Brigid Catholic Church in Pacific Beach, he was active 
in the church's charitable and fund-raising activities. 
</P>
<P>
Osslo is survived by his sister, Maxine Spencer of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's visitation for friends and relatives will be held at Pacific Beach 
Mortuary, 4710 Cass St. A funeral Mass will be said at 10 a.m. Friday at the 
church, 4735 Cass St. Private entombment will be at Holy Cross Mausoleum. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of flowers, the family requests donations to the Alzheimer's Assn. or 
Leukemia Society.

SURVEY SHOWS TOO MUCH TV MAY HAVE LOWERED CHILDREN'S SELF-ESTEEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Children today watch more television than their parents did, according to a 
survey released Tuesday, a fact that may be closely linked to lower self-esteem 
among modern youngsters, experts involved in the study said. 
</P>
<P>
The survey reinforces the belief held by some child development experts that 
television has assumed a dangerously important role in family life and that it 
may indirectly contribute to a host of domestic ills ranging from low 
self-esteem and passivity to child and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
The poll also indicates that most parents spend more time with their children 
than their parents did, but found that parents still need help in communicating 
effectively with their kids. Parents also say they are less strict with their 
children. Possibly as a result, their children do not pitch in with household 
chores as much as they did, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
Still, 80% of parents see themselves as generally more "effective" in bringing 
up their children than were their own parents, according to the survey. Nearly 
four out of five said they are more helpful with their children's homework than 
their parents were. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, which polled 600 parents in Los Angeles, Detroit and Baton Rouge, 
La., was commissioned by the Independent Order of Foresters, a not-for-profit 
fraternal benefit society whose marketing arm is based in Solana Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The survey's release was timed to help publicize a series of free "effective 
parenting " seminars that the organization will sponsor this spring in 
conjunction with elementary schools and PTAs in Detroit, Baton Rouge and Los 
Angeles, spokeswoman Dorie Arneel said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
With 30,000 members in San Diego County and 800,000 members nationwide, the 
organization has an "ongoing commitment to effective parenting and child abuse 
prevention," according to a statement announcing the results of the survey. 
</P>
<P>
The seminars will be conducted by Robert and Dorothy De Bolt of El Cajon, a 
husband and wife team who speak frequently on parenting topics. The De Bolts 
were the subject of an Emmy Award-winning television documentary on their 
upbringing of 20 children, 14 of them adopted and with multiple handicaps. 
</P>
<P>
All 20 children now lead "independent and productive lives," and Dorothy De 
Bolt said the absence of television from the De Bolt household was partly 
responsible for that. 
</P>
<P>
"The tendency is for parents to feel that, if they are watching TV with their 
kids, they are spending some good time together," De Bolt said Tuesday. "These 
parents see TV as something they are sharing, but in fact they are passive 
objects sitting there with this boob tube entertaining them. 
</P>
<P>
"Children and parents (watching television together) aren't sharing any 
conversation, any values, any concerns or talking about goals and how they 
could help one another achieve those goals, which is the essence of what the 
family is all about," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the children absorb the values of situation comedies, De Bolt said, 
"which is a total disservice to any family communication because each sitcom 
has its exaggerated portrayal." 
</P>
<P>
The De Bolts' approach to parenting is to promote self-esteem by assigning the 
children responsibilities so they see themselves as assets to the household 
rather than liabilities. Communication among family members is another goal, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Yolanda Thomas, spokeswoman for the county's Department of Social Services, 
which operates the Child Abuse Hotline and other child protection services, 
said she agrees with the De Bolts' view that too much television is at the root 
of many families' problems. 
</P>
<P>
"TV is replacing parents" as the communicator of values to children, Thomas 
said, and the result is reduced family interaction. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time the children and parents don't interact you are going to have some 
problems. You need communication and you can only do that by doing things 
together," Thomas said. "When you allow the TV to become the parent, the TV 
will be teaching (children) the values that they will have throughout their 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
Independent Order of Foresters spokeswoman Arneel said the seminars scheduled 
for the spring represent a departure of sorts for the organization, which until 
now has has concentrated its efforts specifically on child abuse prevention. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1974, we made a commitment to make people aware that child abuse exists and 
how to report it," Arneel said. Toward that goal, the group has produced 
several films and videos on the subject at its Solana Beach studios, some 
featuring narration by celebrities Bill Cosby, Michael Caine and others. 
</P>
<P>
"The trend now is to prevent child abuse before it happens, which is to teach 
people how to parent, one of the most important jobs we have in our lifetime 
and for which we never receive training," Arneel said.

NO HENDERSON INQUIRY NEEDED, WITT SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: CITY COUNCILMAN HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN ONGOING FEUD WITH LEADER OF SAN 
DIEGANS FOR MANAGED GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
San Diego City Atty. John Witt has declined to investigate allegations that 
Councilman Bruce Henderson violated state law when he met privately with a 
developer who wanted to build a 1,400-room hotel and resort in Henderson's 
district. 
</P>
<P>
The charges were levied last week by Bob Glaser, co-chairman of San Diegans for 
Managed Growth, as part of an ongoing feud started Dec. 14, when Henderson 
accused Glaser of secretly soliciting payments from the same developer. 
</P>
<P>
In a one-paragraph letter Dec. 21 to Glaser, a copy of which was released 
Tuesday by Henderson's office, Witt wrote that nothing in Glaser's complaint 
"discloses any violation of law which would render action by my office 
appropriate. Your concern has been duly noted, however." 
</P>
<P>
Glaser asked for the investigation Dec. 19, the same day he held a news 
conference to rebut Henderson's charges. Glaser asked Witt to see whether 
Henderson's September discussion with Michael Gelfand, senior vice president of 
the De Anza Group Inc., violated laws prohibiting a council member from 
discussing with a developer any project that the the council member may later 
have to review in a quasi-judicial capacity. 
</P>
<P>
De Anza's proposal to build a resort on the shores of Mission Bay Park is the 
central issue in the mudslinging between Henderson and Glaser, currently 
co-chairman of San Diegans for Managed Growth. 
</P>
<P>
At his news conference, Henderson released an August draft contract between 
Gelfand and Glaser, claiming that Glaser had offered to help De Anza win city 
approval of the controversial project in return for payments of more than 
$250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson said the offer was hypocritical in light of lobbying by Glaser and 
other environmentalists to remove Henderson as chairman of the council 
committee overseeing Mission Bay and Balboa parks. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson declared his opposition to the project in November, and said he would 
have used his chairmanship of the council's Public Facilities and Recreation 
Committee to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
Glaser claimed that his offer was to help De Anza move the project out of 
Mission Bay, allowing construction of the hotel and returning the company's 70 
acres on De Anza Point to parkland, a position environmentalists favor. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Glaser claimed that because Henderson had the draft contract since 
September, he should have known that Gelfand rejected the offer because Glaser 
was asking for too much money.

SDSU LOOKING TO START ANOTHER WINNING STREAK; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: AFTER BLOWOUT LOSS TO UAB, TOURNAMENT HOST SDSU HOPES TO 
GET HEALTHY AGAINST NIAGARA. CLEMSON PLAYS VILLANOVA IN OPENING GAME.

SAN DIEGO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Picked apart like a Christmas turkey last Friday by the University of Alabama 
Birmingham, the San Diego State basketball team gingerly returns to the San 
Diego Sports Arena tonight wondering whatever happened to its five-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
SDSU (6-4) plays Niagara (1-7) at 9 in the second game of the Texaco Star 
tournament. The first game, at 6:30, features representatives of two of the 
best basketball conferences in the country -- Villanova (6-5, Big East) against 
Clemson (6-1, Atlantic Coast). 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs have reached the championship of their annual December tournament 
each of the past three seasons, and have one title (1987) to show for it. The 
Aztecs are in position to make it four in a row this year -- Niagara shouldn't 
be a major roadblock. 
</P>
<P>
But then again, who knows? On Dec. 16, the Aztecs were riding their longest 
winning streak -- five games -- since 1984-1985 and things were coming 
together. But that evening, they were flat in a loss at UC Irvine, and then 
they went to the UAB Tournament and played two of their worst games of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"Basketball is a game played in spurts," SDSU Coach Jim Brandenburg said. "If 
you plot it on a graph, you are going to have highs and lows, and you just hope 
the graph shows improvement. You're going to hit the lows, but you hope when 
you plot the whole thing there's a nice increase." 
</P>
<P>
SDSU is in need of an increase in several areas -- particularly shooting 
percentage. The Aztecs made just 44.6% of their shots during a 67-53 victory 
over Southwest Texas Thursday, and they hit a hard-to-believe 30% in their 
91-46 loss to UAB the next night. The 45-point beating tied the record for the 
most lopsided loss in SDSU history. 
</P>
<P>
For the season, SDSU is shooting 43.4%. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to start playing with enthusiasm," Brandenburg said. "We need to play 
with intelligence. It's crunch time, time for us to get going. We have to play 
with a great level of intensity." 
</P>
<P>
As for the rest of the tournament, here are six points of interest, in no 
particular order: 
</P>
<P>
1. The Name's the Thing: If college basketball junkies across the country have 
a difficult time keeping track of SDSU's tournament, it's no wonder. The name 
changes nearly as much as Zsa Zsa Gabor trades in husbands. It was known as the 
Cabrillo tournament from its inception in 1976 through 1985, when it became the 
Holiday Bowl. Last year, it was the McDonald's. Now, voila, the Texaco Star. 
Whew. 
</P>
<P>
2. Ghosts of Christmas Past: Villanova has been here before. Coach Rollie 
Massimino's team won the tournament in 1982, defeating SDSU in the championship 
game, 63-57. The tournament has also been won by such high-profile teams as 
Iowa, Indiana, DePaul, Virginia, Memphis State and Tennessee. Georgetown and 
Patrick Ewing were in the 1980 tournament but were beaten by eventual champion 
DePaul in the first round, 72-67. 
</P>
<P>
3. The ACC vs. Big East Challenge: A special made-for-TV week in the scheduling 
in early December pitted ACC and Big East teams against each other. Not much 
was settled -- the conferences battled to a 4-4 draw. Tonight's 
Villanova-Clemson game is the first this season between the two schools. 
</P>
<P>
4. Speaking of television . . .: Thursday night's championship will be 
broadcast live nationally on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
5. The Coaches: The highest-profile guy in town is Massimino, who is in his 
17th season at Villanova. It was in 1984-85 that Massimino guided Villanova to 
a stunning upset against Georgetown and Ewing in the NCAA championship game. 
The other end of the spectrum features Niagara coach Jack Armstrong who, at 26, 
is the youngest Division I head coach in the nation. Cliff Ellis, meanwhile, is 
in his sixth season at Clemson and Brandenburg is in his third at SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
6. The Rematch Possibilities -- SDSU vs. Villanova or Michael Best vs. Clemson: 
SDSU will play either Villanova or Clemson Thursday. Either matchup should 
prove interesting. The Aztecs opened the season with a 66-58 loss to Villanova 
in the Maui Classic. Center Marty Dow led the Aztecs in that game with 15 
points. Best had eight rebounds. If the Aztecs play Clemson, it will be a 
special occasion for Best. He was a two-year letterman at Clemson before 
transferring to SDSU.

<P>
When did it start -- the national end-of-the-year preoccupation with predicting 
what the future will bring? 
</P>
<P>
Although we are not yet a nation of fortunetellers, one can hardly read a 
magazine or newspaper, listen to radio or watch television without being 
treated to someone's idea of what the coming year -- or decade -- has in store. 
</P>
<P>
And with 1989 marking not only the passing of a year but the demise of the 
penultimate decade in the century as well, the astrologers, economists, 
demographers, professional trend-mappers, political pundits, consultants, 
weather forecasters and other tipsters seem to have gone into overdrive. 
</P>
<P>
But it's tough telling the future. There's always the chance the crystal ball 
will cloud, the draft pick heaped with adulation will prove to have hands of 
clay, or that years of hard-earned expertise will simply prove no match for 
events galloping off pattern, out of control. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask these soothsayers (as we did) what their best, and worst, moments have 
been in their jobs of telling the rest of us what's going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
It's All in the Vibes 
</P>
<P>
When producers of "Ghostbusters" wanted to add a little legitimacy to publicity 
for their movie, who did they call? Nonie Fagatt. 
</P>
<P>
And when there are poltergeists in Hancock Park, illness to ease by faith, and 
marriages to predict by Tarot, it typically is Nonie Fagatt, the cheery 
cabalist of Beverly Hills, behind the hands, the cards and the psychic 
evictions. 
</P>
<P>
She teaches classes in psychic development. She counsels television programs on 
spiritualism and has hosted tours to medieval haunts of Europe. Given the right 
cards, she could probably build a happier psyche for the Phantom of the Opera. 
</P>
<P>
"We call ourselves teachers in the light," Fagatt, 62, explained. "We try and 
get everyone in the world to put forward a more positive vibration that will 
make the world a little better. 
</P>
<P>
"Transcendental meditation. Channeling. Anyone who works with positive 
vibrations is going to help the world because they put off that little 
vibration into the atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Which is why the governments of Eastern Europe are crumbling along with the 
Berlin Wall. Not that Fagatt predicted those occurrences. 
</P>
<P>
"But I felt a betterment in the world," she said. "And that's what the people 
have done in Poland and East Germany. They put it (positivism) in their minds. 
They said: 'It is going to happen.' They made it happen." 
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of her time at the Tarot cards, Fagatt said, she can feel, 
visualize and foretell what is happening with her clients. 
</P>
<P>
"But that means there's 20% out there where you're just not on their 
wavelength," she added. Intellectual resistance to psychic acceptance can block 
communication. Affection between reader and client will also contaminate a 
session. 
</P>
<P>
She believes that is what tripped her 10 years ago when a close friend came to 
Fagatt for a Tarot reading. Her friend was to leave for a European vacation 
that day. 
</P>
<P>
"She was recently divorced and I saw a marriage for her and we discussed that," 
Fagatt said. "She was young and beautiful and very excited about going to 
Europe . . . and I didn't see one (negative) omen." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four hours later, Fagatt said, her friend was badly injured in an 
automobile accident in Paris. She was taken to the hospital in a coma. 
</P>
<P>
Fagatt said she flew to France to "see what I could do . . . but nothing 
helped. She was out of body and I could see her standing in the hospital room 
trying to decide whether she should stay or leave. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked. She would look at me and just say: 'I'm dead.' I pleaded with her 
to stay but she wouldn't come back for me." 
</P>
<P>
A year after the accident, Fagatt said, her friend died. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the biggest bummer of all," she said. "Had I seen it, I would somehow 
have persuaded her not to go. I would have locked her in her house. I would 
have watched her. But I didn't see one glimmer." 
</P>
<P>
How could the ultimate negative escape an expert clairaudient and schooled 
psychic?

* Sheik Chic: Edward VIII gave up his throne to marry Wallis Simpson 53 years 
ago, but the Windsor romantic legend has come alive again at their Bois de 
Boulogne mansion. The wrought-iron gates of the final, favorite residence of 
the pair were thrown open recently for a high tea given by Egyptian tycoon 
Mohammed Al Fayed, who spent $8 million on renovations, with the blessings of 
the villa's official owner, the city of Paris. One of the villa's first 
visitors was actress Joan Collins, who asked Al Fayed if he planned to use the 
mansion for his own parties. "I will, indeed," he said, adding he plans to keep 
it staffed and open to small group visits by special request. 
</P>
<P>
* Beltway, Bah Humbug: John Fairchild, publisher of W and Women's Wear Daily, 
doesn't want anything resembling a Washington politician or political wife on 
the cover of his publications. "The kiss of death is Washington," he told the 
Washington Post. How about First Lady Barbara Bush, a woman said to be much 
admired and something of a trend setter? "Absolutely no interest in it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
* Hostile Reactions: Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa urged Israelis to 
forgive the Nazis for killing 6 million Jews during World War II and condemned 
the Jewish state for oppressing Palestinians. Tutu, on a Christmas pilgrimage 
to the Holy Land, said he would keep criticizing Israel's occupation of the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip even if it meant others accused him of being an 
anti-Semite and worse. Vandals wrote "Tutu is a Nazi" on the wall of the 
Israeli Religious Affairs Ministry before the Nobel Prize-winning cleric met 
minister Zevulun Hammer there Tuesday. Graffiti containing racial slurs about 
Tutu were scrawled Monday on the wall of St. George's Anglican Church in East 
Jerusalem where he celebrated Christmas Mass. 
</P>
<P>
* Royal rap: Viscountess Althorp, Princess Diana's sister-in-law, has some 
choice words about London's tabloid journalists, some of whom have published 
photographs of the lady kissing an old flame. The journalists are "Evil, evil 
people," she says, adding, "I don't know how they go home to their wives and 
children and talk about their day with a clear conscience."

<P>
PRIORITY FOR THE '90S SHOULD BE THE BIG PAYOFF 
</P>

If American consumers don't want to find themselves coming up way short in the 
upcoming decade, they'd better start getting smart now for the 1990s, experts 
warn. So just what sort of resolutions ought savvy consumers make for the New 
Year and the decade beyond? 
</P>
<P>
Attention, shoppers, here's some select advice. 
</P>
<P>
Your No. 1 priority for the '90s, financial advisers and consumer advocates 
say, should be to pay off those high-interest credit cards. There's an 
especially pressing reason to do so, besides, of course, the simple, ugly truth 
that too many Americans charge too much on their plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Consider that as the old decade passes away, so, too, will whatever tax 
advantage you might have held in writing off the interest costs on credit 
cards, many of them charging rates of 18%-20%. On your 1989 taxes, you can 
deduct only 20% of those stiff fees; in 1990, only 10%; after that, it goes to 
0%. 
</P>
<P>
Still, "60% of the people still don't pay off their credit cards within the 
grace period and they end up paying all that high-interest," said Andrew 
Tobias, author of a number of best sellers, including "The Only Investment 
Guide You'll Ever Need," and "Managing Your Money." Tobias, in a phone 
interview from Miami, urged smart consumers to "pay off all of their 
high-interest credit cards, making 20% tax-free, risk-free money." 
</P>
<P>
"It's also good for the country," he said, "because people are borrowing too 
much and not saving enough. We're selling Hawaii for a lot of VCRs. We've sold 
a good chunk of downtown Los Angeles, too. Of course, we have every right to do 
that, but I'm not sure it's the right thing to do. It's like the Indians when 
they sold Manhattan. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Tobias, who added that "it's very hard to get rich borrowing on credit cards," 
continues to recommend his novel plan of buying essentials in bulk to save 
money. 
</P>
<P>
"The savings can be very dramatic," he said, explaining that instead of buying 
one medium tube of toothpaste for $1.89, consumers should wait for the economy 
size to go on sale and buy six "at a great price. That's a year's supply but 
it's 40% less per ounce. And that's a 40% tax-free return on your money." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Brobeck, of the Washington-based Consumer Federation of America, endorsed 
Tobias' credit-card advice and recommended that consumers "before they make 
major purchases, . . . should read Consumer Reports. Not just the Buying Guide, 
but the monthly magazine. It's good not only for products (ratings), but it has 
good general information such as articles on cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
"And anyone who doesn't consult it before buying a new car is looking a gift 
horse in the mouth," he said, adding that families who can't afford the 
magazine or buyer's guide can find them in most local libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Brobeck also urged consumers not only to comparison shop but to "seek to 
negotiate a better deal. Nothing is fixed any more. Everything is open to 
negotiation. You can haggle over virtually everything, even mortgage loans. On 
high-ticket items, merchants are increasingly willing to haggle over the 
price." 
</P>
<P>
But the relationship between retailers and customers need not be adversarial, 
said Bill Dombrowski, vice president of corporate affairs for Carter Hawley 
Hale, parent company of the Broadway department stores. Consumers, he said, 
"should take advantage of the improved level of service. We're placing more 
emphasis on service than ever before and people should take advantage of the 
help salespersons can give them." 
</P>
<P>
When buying, especially big-ticket items like appliances, smart shoppers know 
it pays to look beyond just the price tag. Consumers, for the sake of their 
future utility bills, as well as of the environment, should try to pick 
products that save the most energy, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, once those products get in their homes, "there are a number of ways 
consumers can be more efficient," said Denise King of Southern California Gas 
Co. "The No. 1 thing is to keep natural gas appliances clean, properly adjusted 
and in good working order. They can control their usage with conservation 
measures. And if they're remodeling or need to replace appliances, they should 
consider higher efficiency" units. 
</P>
<P>
If you have to replace a gas water heater, she said, consider models with an 
85% rather than the standard 76% efficiency rating. They may cost $100 more up 
front, but you'll save $15-$30 each year on gas bills. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers also can conserve energy and cut their bills by taking advantage of 
new technologies in "lighting, appliances and building materials," said Michael 
Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers' Action Network (UCAN) in San 
Diego. "There are numbers of new things -- improved insulation, film for 
windows that reduces the amount of heat buildup in the house, better caulking 
materials." 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking to preserve your own energies, it also might be wise, the 
experts said, to consider consulting some common consumer experts. Like? Well, 
consider travel agents, said Eric Friedheim, editor in chief of Travel Agent 
magazine in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where they're going to get the best advice about discounts, lower air 
fares, trendy destinations and hotel accommodations," he said. "The 
reservations systems are computerized and (agents) can find a lot more options 
than a person on his own." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers in the 1990s will have to be "much more sophisticated" about all 
kinds of computerized and otherwise high-tech products and services, said Ken 
McEldowney, executive director of the nonprofit Consumer Action group in San 
Francisco. "Purchasing is going to be done by various types of computer 
technology. And that's going to have incredible implications in terms of 
consumers being able to make intelligent decisions. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
McEldowney and Shames both see potential problems in the development of 
sophisticated, consumer computer data bases and computerized, credit-card 
purchases of almost all goods, including groceries. 
</P>
<P>
McEldowney said he fears that "the technology is going to drive a wedge between 
those who are computer sophisticated and those who aren't." He also has 
concerns about fraud increasing with the computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
Shames, meantime, worries about consumers' "privacy rights." As computerized 
buying expands, Americans must "demand from merchants that personal buying 
habits not be disclosed without permission," he said, adding that consumers 
must learn to see the trade-offs between high-tech convenience and the reality 
that, "almost everything you purchase with a credit card is on . . . data bases 
and that recorded information may become shared with other companies." 
</P>
<P>
And if Big Brother doesn't snare unsuspecting consumers in the 1990s, watch out 
because other woes just might: Crime will continue to be a major American 
headache, law-enforcement officials say, adding that bunko schemes and fake 
charities, for example, assuredly won't disappear in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
But Good Samaritans with smarts more than ever will know in the '90s that "it's 
a good idea to check out references before you give to a charity you don't know 
too much about," said Linda Cuarenta, senior investigator for the Los Angeles 
City Social Service Department. 
</P>
<P>
"If a charity is soliciting in Los Angeles and we have the organization on 
file, we can tell people about it," she said. "Or we might not have it on file 
but have heard of it. People can call us ((213) 485-5003) and ask. They should 
also ask the charity for its financial statement and a brochure about it. If 
it's legitimate, they should send it." 
</P>
<P>
Two other sources that check on charities: the National Charities Information 
Bureau in New York (212) 929-6300 or the California Attorney General's office 
-- in Los Angeles, (213) 736-2044. 
</P>
<P>
And when it's all said and done, what's the best consumers can hope for from 
the '90s? Well, maybe the advent, finally, of a kinder, gentler age? 
</P>
<P>
"People are much more violent than 25 years ago," cautioned advice columnist 
Dear Abby. "We're living in stressful times and we have to find some way to get 
along, with relatives, with friends, with each other. We should try to hurt as 
few feelings as possible. There's no right way or wrong way to do things. But 
there is a diplomatic way to do everything."

Bob Baedeker of Laguna Hills, whose family produces the thoroughbred racing tip 
sheet sold at Santa Anita and other race tracks, remembers well his best streak 
of predictions: 
</P>
<P>
"On our Baedeker Guide, we give three choices for each race, the first one 
being our top pick: On the three days of the Labor Day weekend in 1984, my dad 
(Frederick) was traveling, and I did the handicapping. Out of those 27 races, 
my top picks won 19 times." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there was a low point, in 1968 -- ironically, the first day 
the son was on his own to produce picks: "My dad was preparing to join a picnic 
group in the Santa Anita infield, and he asked me to do the card. Out of my 
three choices for each of the nine races -- a total of 27 selections -- I had a 
grand total of one winner. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to suffer along with dad as the afternoon party wore on in the infield. 
When I got home, my mom said: 'Well, you've got nowhere to go but up.' " 
</P>
<P>
It was nearly half a century ago that Frederick Baedeker, now 76, began the tip 
sheet, selling it on the streets leading to the tracks. His high point came on 
opening day at Hollywood Park in 1950, when he had eight winners out of eight 
picks, one of them paying $27. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays the father and his 43-year-old son alternate the job. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the first things my father stressed to me," the son said, "was to 
visualize the race in advance -- which horses will be the early speed, which 
will be in mid-pack, which will be coming from behind." 
</P>
<P>
Whoever is to do the next day's card, the younger Baedeker said, spends three 
or four hours the night before studying the Daily Racing Form and his own notes 
and running and rerunning race videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
The next morning he calls the racing secretary's office for the scratches, then 
has the selections printed. 
</P>
<P>
For the clients, it's in the card. DAVID LARSEN

PEACE AND PROFITS

Early in this decade, William Shireman, a Sacramento environmental and 
recycling consultant, says he looked into the future and saw relative peace and 
harmony where there was only faction and discord. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Shireman recalls that he predicted that "more and more legitimate 
common ground" would be found between those traditional foes, environmentalists 
and the business establishment. 
</P>
<P>
To Shireman, the conclusion was quite logical. To achieve its goals in energy 
efficiency, recycling and other areas, environmentalists -- largely unschooled 
in the ways of the free market -- would have to seek common cause with business 
people who saw a profit in a cleaner environment. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Shireman contends that he was right, at least to a degree. While business 
and environmentalists still are often at loggerheads, there are areas of peace. 
Recycling has become a growth industry, he says, pointing to widespread 
adoption of state recycling laws that have spawned new, profitable businesses 
in metals and glass. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery of common ground took a little learning on both sides, he says. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in 1974 corporations generally scoffed at the environmentalist 
contention that the U.S. living standard could be maintained with one-third 
less energy use, Shireman said. A couple of oil crises later, the U.S. economy 
is now one-third more energy efficient than it was 15 years ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In this instance, business learned that environmental ideas could be one way of 
cutting costs -- as well as making profitable energy-efficient products, 
Shireman said. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks that this trend will continue into the 1990s, partly because of a 
move toward the "true costing" of natural resources such as forest products and 
water. GARRY ABRAMS

Real estate consultant Sanford Goodkin's worst prediction came in baseball, 
when he forecast that the Brooklyn Dodgers would win the 1941 World Series. The 
Yankees beat the Dodgers that year, four games to one. 
</P>
<P>
But in real estate projections, he's almost letter perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"I projected the real estate boom of 1976-79 in California during the national 
(real estate) depression of 1974-75," said Goodkin, who is based in Del Mar and 
has written and consulted on real estate for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
He also correctly forecast the anti-growth movement in California in the early 
1970s, a movement that he says has gained momentum in this state and in 
Colorado since then. For the 1990s, Goodkin expects anti-growth sympathies to 
flourish across the nation, and he projects better land use in the U.S. 
"because it is necessary, because foreign (investors) comprehend it, lenders 
will demand it and the consumer will finally understand that is it better for 
the total environment." 
</P>
<P>
Along that line, Goodkin believes that "attached housing -- townhouses, stacked 
units -- is the future, because of the coming need to deal with water problems, 
infrastructure of cities and land waste." 
</P>
<P>
He thinks home buyers will find the new multiplex kinds of attached housing 
more to their liking than ever before, because "new materials and much wiser 
design" will offer more privacy. 
</P>
<P>
"The single family home of the future will be on a tony lot," Goodkin said. "It 
will be wonderfully designed, have a small patio of its own and a large common 
area, with landscaping and many amenities. It won't have a moat or machine gun 
towers, but it will have the best electronic surveillance known to man. . . . I 
call it the Nintendo house. It's prewired and protected, has recreational 
space, cable and education capabilities all together. From the home you'll be 
able to plug into libraries. That will be common in the 1990s." LYNN SIMROSS

SCREEN STYLE: DRESSING FOR LAUGHS

<TEXT>
<P>
The Movie: "She Devil." 
</P>
<P>
The look: A contemporary tale of two women in need of an image consultant. When 
we first meet them, Meryl Streep as Mary Fisher is a romance writer with a a 
corner on pink taffeta iced in ruffles, while Barr's housewife character is 
pure polyester tent dresses. 
</P>
<P>
The costume designer: Academy-Award winning designer ('All That Jazz") Albert 
Wolsky. His credits are impressive: "Sophie's Choice," "Manhattan," as well as 
the current release, "Enemies, A Love Story." 
</P>
<P>
The conflict: Both characters evolve drastically during the course of the 
comedy, so the fashion story had to underline their respective personal 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
The plan: To take both characters on what Wolsky calls a "voyage of clothes." 
In the beginning, Streep's Fisher (shown here) dresses in variations on the 
flowery style of British romance novelist, Barbara Cartland. "That was the germ 
of the idea," Wolsky explains. He has Fisher floating in cloud-soft silk 
charmeuse, taffeta, crepe and chiffon. She wears pink and "face powder" colors 
such as beige, ecru, silver gray and lavender. By contrast, Barr's Patchett 
epitomizes a woman with a big waist line, bad taste and no time to shop. Wolsky 
has her schlepping around in sweats, jeans, jumpers and tasteless polyester 
floral print dresses. 
</P>
<P>
The program: Ultimately, when Streep's Fisher attempts to become a serious 
writer, her clothes evolve from light to dark, from silk to wool, from flowing 
to fitted. As Wolsky puts it, it's a look you might expect from a contemporary 
woman writer. Patchett's fashion emancipation begins when she starts her own 
employment agency. At her most stylish -- and liberated -- she wears white and 
beige trouser suits with long matching coats. 
</P>
<P>
The sources: Wolsky says he designed about half of each character's wardrobes, 
and bought the rest at New York stores. For Barr's dowdy period, he did some 
shopping at large-size stores in suburban malls, and bought her navy business 
suits at Macy's. He overhauled almost everything he bought, adding or removing 
details, until each item was unrecognizable. He avoided head-to-toe designer 
looks. "I don't think people dress that way," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The payoff: For large women, the stylish Barr can be a fashion role model. By 
wearing clean lines, and not hiding under tents, she looks thinner and has a 
certain flair. As for Streep, her character somehow looks foolish to the end, 
even in her black-chic stage. After all, this is a comedy. BETTY GOODWIN

CHIPS OFF THE PINE BLOCK AS FIRE STARTER

<P>
From the manufacturer that offered Fire Flakes charcoal barbecue starter last 
summer, there's a new winter warmer: Fire Flakes Wood Fire Starter, which makes 
lighting that comfy fireplace blaze is a simple task. 
</P>
<P>
The flakes, specially cut pine wood chips covered with paraffin wax, replace 
newspapers or kindling. They come in separate 2.2-oz. packages -- seven to a 
box. Pop a packet under the firewood, light and you should have a nice fire in 
15 minutes, says Chuck Aydelotte, of the Chevron Chemical Co. 
</P>

Putting the Lid on Marriage Disputes 
</P>
<P>
LidAlert is a small alarmlike device that affixes to the commode and plays 
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" when the toilet's flushed but the lid isn't 
lowered. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, it might sound like a gag gift. But it could be a help in ending the long 
battle between men and women over lowering the toilet seat. It also can help 
keep a child or pet out of the toilet bowl. The 2 1/2-inch long, 1 1/2-inch 
wide device comes equipped with a lifetime battery. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started to develop the idea, the feedback that I received from women 
was tremendous," said its inventor, Blake Warrington, a Dublin, Calif., 
firefighter. "I was told that it would save marriages and is the next best 
thing to having separate bathrooms." 
</P>
<P>
Suggested retail for LidAlert is $19.95. In Southern California, it is 
available at Broadway department stores. If you can't find it in your area, you 
can order it from Kaleidosphere Inc., 7400 Center Ave., Suite 105, Huntington 
Beach 92647; phone (800) 433-8900.

A Lure That Will Never Get Away 
</P>
<P>
For the anglers in the family, there's FISH-ON Lure Hunter, a new retrieval 
system that keeps them from losing their favorite lure. 
</P>
<P>
Constructed of metal to withstand harsh outdoor conditions, the Lure Hunter 
includes a 6 1/2-oz. plated zinc retrieval head that can be easily affixed to a 
line. 
</P>
<P>
It descends directly to the point where the knot is tied. There is a circle of 
seven stainless-steel teeth that catches the eyelet of the lure or swivel snap. 
Once hooked up, the system has 50 feet of 150-pound nylon line spooled on a 
one-piece weatherproof handle. When not in use, the compact device fits snugly 
in a tackle box. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Sir Lennox Berkeley, a significant British composer influenced by neoclassical 
music and perhaps best known for his choral "Stabat Mater," died Tuesday at 86. 
</P>
<P>
Berkeley, who suffered from a heart ailment and a type of Alzheimer's disease, 
died in a London hospital of a respiratory infection, said his son, Michael. 
</P>
<P>
Berkeley wrote four operas, chamber music, concertos and four symphonies. 
</P>
<P>
He attended Oxford University where he read French, Old French and philology 
before devoting himself to music. 
</P>
<P>
He studied under Nadia Boulanger for five years in Paris, where he and Igor 
Stravinsky became friends, and returned to Britain in 1935, the year of his 
first major work, the oratorio "Jonah." 
</P>
<P>
Three years later he produced another choral work, "Domini Est Terra," then 
music for string quartets, solo instruments and orchestra. His Symphony No. 1 
was completed in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
The "Stabat Mater," for six voices and 12 instruments, was written for Benjamin 
Britten's English Opera Group and was first performed in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
His operas were "Nelson," first performed in 1951; "A Dinner Engagement," 
"Ruth" and "Castaway."

A businessman whose winery was linked to a huge marijuana and hashish seizure 
last year in the San Francisco Bay Area was arrested on theft and fraud 
charges. Robert Pitner, a former leading partner in the bankrupt Joseph Mathews 
Winery in Napa, was arrested in Sacramento. Also charged in the alleged scheme 
was David Hanson, former president of the LendVest Mortgage Co. The state 
indictments against Pitner and Hanson were the first attempt to press charges 
associated in the loss of millions of dollars in investments when the 
businesses collapsed. The mortgage company and the winery went broke after 
federal agents linked them to 57 tons of marijuana and hashish found weled 
behind steel panels on a barge. It was called the single biggest pot haul in 
U.S. history.

<P>
The California attorney general's duty to protect the public interest in the 
environment does not prevent him from defending a state agency that promotes 
logging redwoods, a state Court of Appeal ruled in San Francisco. The 1st 
District Court of Appeal, however, faulted Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp for 
taking a one-sided posture in defense of the Humboldt County logging case. 
Environmentalists -- opposed to a Pacific Lumber Co. plan to cut 700 acres, 
including 54 acres of centuries-old trees -- challenged the state Forestry 
Department's routine approval of the plan. A Humboldt County Superior Court 
ordered Van de Kamp's office off the case, ruling that a conflict existed with 
the attorney general's duty to protect the public interest. But in a 3-0 ruling 
reversing that decision, the appeals court added that Van de Kamp's office 
could be disqualified from the case if future evidence shows a conflict of 
interest.

Marc Lee Antonsen, 24, of Redway, also was charged with keeping a vicious 
animal which caused death to another. Antonsen's nephew, Garrett Michael East, 
wandered within reach of the dog, whose leash was tied to a pickup truck,

OPENING DAY PROVES FULL OF SURPRISES; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA ANITA: RECORD CROWD OF 50,605 SEES PAT VALENZUELA'S APPARENT WINNER 
DISQUALIFIED. IN FEATURE, MUSIC MERCI STRIKES AN UNEXPECTED HIGH NOTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In his return from a 60-day suspension for a positive drug test, Pat Valenzuela 
appears on the verge of additional unwanted leave. 
</P>
<P>
Riding for the first time since mid-October, Valenzuela was first under the 
wire with Flom Tuesday in the opening race of Santa Anita's 53rd season. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Valenzuela's triumphant wave of his whip, this was a victory that 
clearly wasn't going to stand. 
</P>
<P>
The "Inquiry" sign became lit soon after Flom, the 2-1 favorite, had weaved 
through the stretch, taking the path of runner-up Ms. Leroy not once, but 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
After a surprisingly lengthy deliberation by the stewards, Flom was 
disqualified and placed second. Valenzuela will meet with the stewards Thursday 
and is expected to get a five-day suspension, beginning Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Extremely busy on his return -- he rode in seven of the nine races -- 
Valenzuela won the fourth, going wire-to-wire on 13-1 shot Mythical Being. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great," he said after his last race. "I'm not tired at all. I think I 
could ride another couple of races. 
</P>
<P>
"I might have got a little excited (on Flom). I didn't know the filly that 
well. I didn't realize (Alex Solis on Ms. Leroy) was in there. Unfortunately, 
those things happen. I'm just so happy and so excited. It feels good to be back 
and riding and here every day. I hope the stewards will be a little lenient 
with a person who's been away two months and is a little rusty. I know they'll 
use their best judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela wasn't the only one glad to be back. Obviously, horseplayers were 
also delighted that the scene had shifted from Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Two days after Hollywood Park closed with a whimper, 50,605 fans showed up at 
Santa Anita, setting an opening-day record for a non-holiday weekday. The 
previous high was 49,776 on a Wednesday in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really startling," said Cliff Goodrich, president and chief operating 
officer of Santa Anita. "It's a tremendous start. We were expecting in the low 
40s and we don't miss by this much too often. I bet nobody expected us to get 
50,000." 
</P>
<P>
Another 9,407 attended the nine intertrack sites, and the total combined handle 
was $9,962,791. 
</P>
<P>
After being idle since finishing last in the Del Mar Derby on Aug. 20, Music 
Merci continued his tradition of running well when fresh, coming on in the 
final quarter-mile to win the $112,300 Malibu Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
Ridden by Laffit Pincay, the Stop The Music gelding began his rally while wide, 
took the lead from a tiring Premium Award shortly before the sixteenth pole and 
won easier than the margin of 1 1/2 lengths would indicate. 
</P>
<P>
By winning for the eighth time in 18 starts, the 2-1 second choice increased 
his earnings to $1,321,460. The victory should prepare him for the 1 1/8-mile 
San Fernando Stakes, the middle leg of the Charles H. Strub series. 
</P>
<P>
Music Merci covered the seven furlongs in 1:21 3/5 and might have fooled his 
trainer, Craig Lewis, who had said he didn't have Music Merci "fully cranked 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Even if he wasn't at his best, Music Merci was good enough to handle a Malibu 
field that wasn't among the finest in race history. Exemplary Leader, a 20-1 
shot who also was far back early, rallied for second place, almost two lengths 
ahead of 34-1 outsider Doncareer. 
</P>
<P>
Bruho, the 2-1 favorite ridden by Corey Black, didn't make any mistakes but 
faltered and finished eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"(Music Merci) is such a quality horse that he's subject to a gigantic effort 
at any time," Lewis said. "After the Del Mar Derby, he mostly just needed rest 
after a rigorous campaign. He's been at Santa Anita since then. 
</P>
<P>
"We shipped him here from Del Mar, walked him a month, then grazed him in the 
afternoon, then jogged him and gradually built him up. He's a little stronger, 
there's more muscle to him and he's a little more relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
Pincay, who has committed to ride Music Merci for the remainder of the Strub 
series, was impressed with the mount he picked up after Gary Stevens had 
switched to Navajo Storm, who was held out of the Malibu by trainer Jack Van 
Berg. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got a lot of class," Pincay said of Music Merci. "He broke real well. 
There wasn't a lot of speed to worry about, so I didn't want to rush him. I sat 
still, and he dropped back. When he made his move, I knew he would get there. 
</P>
<P>
"The last sixteenth, I wasn't getting into him. I knew he had it won and I 
never had to ask him. It was a good race for him." 
</P>
<P>
Bruho, fitted with blinkers again after throwing Pincay in the On Trust 
Handicap last month, was well-positioned in the Malibu but had nothing left in 
the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't run his best race," Black said. "The (No. 1 post position) didn't do 
him any good because he had to stand there a long time. He got in a little 
tight down the backstretch. Once I got through, he grabbed the bit and started 
moving sooner than I wanted and got in tight again. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to slow him down, and then he never took the bit again. It's 
disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Steward Pete Pedersen, on Flom's disqualification: "It was clear-cut. He wasn't 
clear in either instance, and the rules of racing are a rider is supposed to 
keep a straight course. It's just that simple. If we can blame it on the horse, 
we'll blame it on the horse. If not, the blame goes on the jockey." 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Juan Gonzalez spent the night in Arcadia Methodist Hospital after being 
unseated by one of his horses, an unraced 2-year-old, Tuesday morning. 
Gonzalez, 44, had X-rays taken after complaining of pain in his upper back and 
shoulder area and also suffered bone chips in both hands, which will be treated 
by an orthopedic surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a series of longshots on opening day, there will be a Pick Six 
carryover of $118,284 when racing resumes Thursday. . . . Next to Music Merci, 
the most impressive winner Tuesday was Oeilladine, who accelerated late to take 
the seventh, a $60,000 classified allowance race. A 3-year-old, she had won 
nine of 15 in her native France against less-than-top grade competition. 
Trained by Jude Feld and ridden by Gary Stevens in her U.S. debut, she ran the 
mile on turf in 1:33 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
The nightly race replay show will air at 7:30 p.m. on KSCI . . . Davie's Lamb, 
who was claimed for $32,000 by Julio Canani and became a stakes-winner, has 
been retired, and the hope is to breed her to Gulch. The 5-year-old 
Unpredictable mare won nine of 30 on the turf after being taken by Canani and 
earned more than $520,000.

HERE'S THE CATCH: USC'S SMALL RECEIVERS PLAY BIG; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: TROJANS GARY WELLMAN AND JOHN JACKSON ARE CAPABLE OF MAKING 
THE BIG PLAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Gary Wellman began his freshman football season at USC in 1986, he had 
many doubts. He lacked confidence in his ability to play wide receiver after 
completing an outstanding career at Westlake High, where he starred as an 
all-purpose runner. 
</P>
<P>
At 5 feet 9 and a stocky 170 pounds, Wellman thought he was too small to play 
big-time college football -- until he saw John Jackson on the practice field. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was a redshirt freshman who stood only a couple of inches taller and 
weighed nearly the same as Wellman. Jackson may have looked as if he had just 
graduated from a local Pop Warner League program, but he showed his younger 
teammate that size is not necessary to be a successful receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, small receivers are found running inside on carpeted, domed stadium 
floors, executing in a run-and-shoot offense using multiple formations. They 
are seldom found on a team that features a power offense with two standard 
receivers, playing in a vast grass-filled stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But at USC, more than three years after their first meeting, Wellman and 
Jackson have teamed up to become perhaps the Trojans' smallest pair of starting 
receivers ever. 
</P>
<P>
As USC heads into its third consecutive Rose Bowl game, against Michigan on 
Monday, Jackson, a senior, leads the team in catches and yardage with 57 
receptions for 908 yards. Wellman, a redshirt junior, is the team leader in 
touchdown catches with six while catching 22 passes for 421 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's USC career statistics are not astonishing when you consider that he 
was an All-American wideout at La Puente Bishop Amat High, where he had 92 
career catches for 1,583 yards. And he is the son of former Trojan assistant 
coach John Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
However, Wellman's college prosperity came as a surprise, even to himself. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first showed up at SC, I was skeptical if I would ever have a shot to 
play," Wellman said. "I had never played receiver before and all I knew about 
it was to just run and try to get open. But once I saw J.J. (Jackson) play as a 
redshirt freshman, that inspired me." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Wellman shared time with Jackson at flanker, opposite split end Erik 
Affholter, and caught 21 catches for 377 yards. 
</P>
<P>
With the graduation of Affholter, it was Wellman's rise as a receiver that 
prompted Jackson to be switched to split end before this season. Given his 
first starting role, Wellman has turned into the Trojans' big-play receiver, 
averaging 19.1 yards a catch. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we work great together," Wellman said. "J.J. is such a threat that 
teams are always double-covering him, which opens things up for me." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson credits the pair's success to time spent working together. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary is so easy to adapt to," he said. "At first, it took time for us to 
adjust to one another, but with the more work we have gotten together, the 
better we have become. I now know where he is going to be on the field at all 
times." 
</P>
<P>
Originally, Wellman had speed but was not known for his pass routes or catching 
ability. Jackson was considered a disciplined, sure-handed type with only 
average speed. 
</P>
<P>
Through hard work, they have each added some of the other's qualities to their 
own skills. 
</P>
<P>
Wellman, who ran on the Trojans' 400-meter relay team last spring, has become a 
complete receiver. This season, his six touchdown catches averaged 25.7 yards, 
and he has demonstrated a knack for making difficult catches, such as his 
game-winning, two-point conversion against Washington State and his 
controversial diving touchdown against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I am definitely a better receiver now," Wellman said. "I had a couple of great 
spring football practices and I think that helped me develop to the point where 
I know I can play." 
</P>
<P>
To his teammates, Wellman appeared out of place when he took his spot in the 
receivers' pass-route line four years ago. But not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first saw Gary, I had only heard that he was real fast -- but I didn't 
believe it when I looked at him," Jackson said. "He had really short legs and 
arms (and was) not what you would think a speedy receiver would look like. But 
after seeing him play, I knew that he would become a receiver who would step in 
after the older guys graduated." 
</P>
<P>
While Wellman had to learn the finer points of being a receiver, Jackson simply 
had to get faster and bigger. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was not exactly a plodder when he arrived at USC, having run the 
40-yard dash in 4.7 seconds, nor was he especially undersized at 5-11, 170 
pounds. His problem was that he simply gave the illusion that he was both slow 
and small. 
</P>
<P>
But after many hours in USC's weight room and on the track, Jackson transformed 
himself into a speedy giant. Well, sort of. He is an inch taller, with an added 
15 pounds of muscle, and consistently runs the 40 in 4.5. 
</P>
<P>
Several times this season, Jackson displayed his strength and speed. Against 
Ohio State, his 87-yard touchdown catch was the longest pass play in USC 
history. Against Notre Dame, he muscled and maneuvered for a school-record 14 
catches for 200 yards, also setting an Irish-opponent record. 
</P>
<P>
What is impressive about Jackson's achievements this season is that they came 
on passes by Todd Marinovich, a redshirt freshman quarterback. Marinovich was 
pressed into action when Jackson's friend and summer-workout partner, Pat 
O'Hara, suffered a knee injury a week before the Trojans' season-opening loss 
to Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, USC had the passing combination of Rodney Peete to Affholter, which 
was expected to be replaced by O'Hara to Jackson. But that combination was lost 
for the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough to deal with because Pat and I had worked so hard in the 
off-season," Jackson said. "When Todd first came in, I made the mistake of 
trying too hard. I always wanted to be open for him but I should have just been 
doing my job. I should have had confidence in him instead of trying to play for 
him and me." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's accomplishments at USC, both on and off the field, are 
well-documented. In the condensed player biography section in the 1990 Rose 
Bowl program, he has a page all to himself listing his accomplishments, which 
include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Named a two-time GTE Academic All-American, who received his undergraduate 
business degree last May and began work on his M.B.A. in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Received an NCAA Top Six award given to the best senior athletes in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chosen as a National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame scholar-athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Selected as a second-team All-American by the Sporting News and as an 
honorable-mention selection by the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Became USC's career leader in receptions with 158 and in yardage with 
2,323. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Has caught a pass in 36 consecutive games to tie former Trojan Randy 
Simmrin's Pacific 10 record. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson was also honored as an All-Pac-10 center fielder last season and was 
drafted by the Angels in June. He has already been named as a 1990 preseason 
All-American by Collegiate Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike that other Jackson, Raider running back/Kansas City Royals outfielder Bo 
Jackson, John Jackson is clear about which career he will pursue first. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought that my baseball career would work out like it has," he said. 
"After I left high school, I thought my baseball career was basically over. I 
only began to play it here out of curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, it has come to the point where I have to decide on what I am going to do. 
I have had a good college career doing both, but I've decided to pursue 
football. I will play baseball this spring just to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson now must prove himself to be worthy of an NFL career, but is optimistic 
about his chances. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, USC has had a more run-oriented offense," said Jackson, who some 
scouts say could be drafted as high as the second round. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, this trend is changing. We now feature a more diverse offense where 
we pass and run equally. I think that I can compete equally with any receiver 
in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
Next season, while Jackson embarks on a new career, Wellman will be taking his 
turn under the senior spotlight. But both have a common goal at the moment -- 
ending USC's two-game Rose Bowl losing streak.

TO DWELL WITH IT: CLIPPERS BEATEN IN FINAL SECOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Lonely Street? No. Down near the end of Figueroa Street, it's Heartbreak Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Better known as the Sports Arena, it turned cruel on the tenants again Tuesday 
night, as if the Clippers, though off to a good start at home, didn't have 
enough ulcer-makers to deal with. See: One-point loss to New York on tip-in of 
missed free throw with two seconds left, one-point loss to San Antonio when 
last-second three-point shot was ruled a two-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
This time, it was left to a few nemeses to decide a 112-111 victory for the 
Boston Celtics before 15,350, one Larry Joe Bird and a couple of referees. The 
latter are far more anonymous, but the Clippers, not for the first time, figure 
those officials created more problems than the guy who scored 27 points and the 
game-winning free throws. 
</P>
<P>
As if to add to the drama, there were two disputes that denied the Clippers 
(9-15) their sixth consecutive home victory. The first put Boston ahead, the 
second kept the Clippers down for good. 
</P>
<P>
Boston led, 110-109, when Reggie Lewis got two of his season-high 28 points, 21 
of which came in the second half, on two free throws with 10.3 seconds left. 
But when Charles Smith gave Kevin McHale and Robert Parish a head fake and made 
a fall-away 10-footer in the lane with 5.1 remaining, the Clippers were back 
ahead, 111-110. 
</P>
<P>
Timeout Boston. The Clippers called one, too. When play resumed, McHale, at 
mid-court, threw the ball in to Bird, who drove left along the perimeter and 
was greeted with a double-team by Smith and Benoit Benjamin about 20 feet from 
the basket. Bird went up for the jumper; Smith and Benjamin appeared to be 
stationary with their arms up. 
</P>
<P>
Foul, with two-tenths of a second to play. The crowd, which included a 
noticeable Celtic contingent, already reached a fevered pitch when Bird stepped 
to the line and waved his arms as if to say, "More." 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I've been able to do my whole basketball career is block the noise 
out," he said. "It's just like shooting by yourself." 
</P>
<P>
So Bird made both free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"What foul?" Smith pleaded afterward. "Everybody here knows it wasn't a foul. 
Larry said after the game I didn't foul him." 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes and no. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him he blocked the ball clean at the top," Bird said. "But he got me 
with a little body contact. They don't call it very often, but it's still a 
foul. I also told him he traveled on the play just before." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, making a good impression in their only national television 
appearance of 1989-90, called a timeout again. The first option was a lob under 
the basket to one of the big men. When Danny Manning stood with the ball at 
halfcourt and saw that route close, he went to the second choice, Ron Harper. 
</P>
<P>
Harper caught the ball a few feet in front of the Clipper bench, turned and 
fired. The ball swished, and players celebrated. Then they saw referee Mike 
Mathis, who had signaled game over before Harper even shot. 
</P>
<P>
There was no doubt in Harper's mind it should have counted. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Don Casey wasn't quite so emphatic. 
</P>
<P>
"That was close," Casey said. "If it was in Boston Garden, the timer may not 
have gone off as quick. . . . But that's one I can't argue." 
</P>
<P>
Smith finished with 33 points, 21 in the second half. That included one stretch 
in the fourth quarter when he scored 10 straight and 12 of 15 Clipper points in 
a span of 4:28. 
</P>
<P>
"Charles is developing an I-want-the-ball persona," Casey said after the 
Clippers lost to the Celtics for the 11th consecutive time. "He felt 
comfortable with McHale, and I thought he did an excellent job." 
</P>
<P>
That Smith's final basket was only the game-winner once removed is what will be 
remembered, however. It is another would-of, could-of loss, piling up as they 
are. 
</P>
<P>
"Again," Smith said, "a game was snatched from us." 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
It was the Clippers' second sellout of the season. . . . Gary Grant had one of 
his best shooting performances of the season, making 11 of 20 for 24 points. He 
also had 12 assists and only three turnovers. . . . Reggie Lewis led Boston 
(15-11) with a season-high 28 points. . . . Larry Bird, on his free-throw line 
theatrics in the waning seconds: "I don't call it egging them on. I think it's 
just getting them involved." 
</P>
<P>
Boston General Manager Jan Volk, who rarely accompanies the team on trips 
outside the Atlantic Division, had an informal meeting Tuesday with Leonard 
Armato, agent for Brian Shaw, to lay a foundation for talks that could bring 
Shaw back to the Celtics next season. Shaw has a two-year deal with Il 
Messaggero in Italy, but the second season includes an escape clause, and Shaw 
has said he would like to return to the NBA in 1990-91 under the right 
conditions. Shaw, from Richmond, Calif., and UC Santa Barbara, was in 
California for a Christmas vacation and was scheduled to fly back to Rome 
today.

MORNING BRIEFING: HORSE RACING INDUSTRY WON ITS BIGGEST GAMBLE OF DECADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARR KLUENDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The winner of the last race of the decade at Hollywood Park was Litigator, in a 
bottom-level claiming event Sunday. It was not a particularly memorable 
occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
But slightly more than five years earlier, the most memorable American horse 
race of the decade took place at the Inglewood track, according to Andrew Beyer 
of the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
Beyer writes: 
</P>
<P>
"On Nov. 10, 1984, the horse racing industry didn't know what to make of an 
innovation called the Breeders' Cup. Pessimists wondered whether the owners and 
trainers of top horses would support this day of racing offering $10 million in 
purses; they feared that the Breeders' Cup would upstage or eliminate other 
long-established championship events. 
</P>
<P>
"But all of these concerns evaporated after one spectacular afternoon of racing 
at Hollywood Park. The sunny day was so glorious that the event seemed 
heaven-blessed; the races drew the best horses from America and Europe, and 
they produced one heart-stopping drama after another. 
</P>
<P>
"The event came to a fitting climax in the $3-million Breeders' Cup Classic. 
Wild Again, a 31-1 shot, led on the final turn, where he was challenged by the 
odds-on favorite, Slew o' Gold. The two battled head to head, and then the 
stretch-running Gate Dancer swooped outside them. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, the Classic was a three-horse race, with inches separating the rivals, 
until Slew o' Gold was bumped and squeezed back. Wild Again finished a head in 
front of Gate Dancer, but the 'Inquiry' sign was lighted on the tote board. 
</P>
<P>
"With NBC's cameras scrutinizing their deliberation, the stewards made the 
right call: Gate Dancer had initiated the contact. Wild Again was the official 
winner of the world's richest race, and the success of the Breeders' Cup seemed 
to have been made official, too." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What do the wives of Golden State Warriors Winston Garland, Uwe 
Blab, John Shasky and Manute Bol, Warrior assistant coach Gary St. Jean and 
trainer Tom Abdenour have in common? 
</P>
<P>
Close to the vest: Bill McCartney, University of Colorado football coach, has 
closed practices and limited the availability of his players for interviews as 
the top-ranked Buffaloes prepare for their Orange Bowl game against Notre Dame 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
McCartney said: "I'm going to try to make sure that's my team playing New 
Year's Night -- protect them from the media onslaught, and gear the practices 
so we're ready to play that night and not prematurely." 
</P>
<P>
Second choice: Doug Moe, coach of the Denver Nuggets, on his craft: "Actually, 
my No. 1 goal is retirement, but I can't afford that. No. 2 is coaching. I want 
to retire, but I can't. So I have to coach, mainly because I can't do anything 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Wake-up call: After being booed in San Francisco, rookie cornerback Deion 
Sanders of the Atlanta Falcons said of the fans: "They'll have to get up in the 
morning at 6 o'clock to go to work. I may get up and go to the bank and count 
my money. I don't care about those people." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: All are pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Mike Webster, Kansas City center, on 250-pound Chief running back 
Christian Okoye: "I've learned to get out of his way. If I can't move my man 
out of the hole, I leave him there and let him take the brunt of it. I don't 
want to be in the pile when Okoye hits it." GARR KLUENDER

NATURE PHOTOGRAPHY: RANCHO PALOS VERDES RESIDENT TRAVELS THE WORLD SEEKING 
MARINE MAMMALS, WHICH ALSO BENEFIT FROM HIS SUCCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was four years ago in the dead of winter when Bob Talbot, searching the 
Pacific Ocean off Dana Point for gray whales to photograph in their natural 
habitat, came across a large whale struggling in a fisherman's drift net. 
</P>
<P>
The situation appeared hopeless, Talbot recalled recently from his home in 
Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just completely entangled from nose to tail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Talbot, armed with a knife clamped onto the end of a long gaff, could not get 
close enough to the whale without it getting excited -- and further entangled 
-- so he called for help. 
</P>
<P>
A research vessel soon arrived. Four divers joined Talbot, who then grabbed his 
camera in an attempt to document the rescue attempt. 
</P>
<P>
With the whale losing its battle against the mass of monofilament, Talbot 
handed the camera back and tried to assist the others in cutting the animal 
free. 
</P>
<P>
But the whale sounded. The four others let go. Talbot, the only diver with a 
scuba tank, held on so as not to lose his place on the net. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see exactly what I did wrong," he said. "There were big looms of net 
hanging beneath the whale, and when he went down, the net went up and there I 
was. It came up over my tank." 
</P>
<P>
Talbot had become almost as entangled as the whale, the net having wrapped 
around his mask and regulator. He yelled for help as the whale lifted him out 
of the water and smashed him down again and again. The other divers could only 
watch as the whale tried to shake free of the net and Talbot. 
</P>
<P>
"The worse he shook, the worse I got tangled," Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
By then, a lifeguard boat had arrived on the scene, but its divers wouldn't go 
in the water. It was too dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Talbot managed to unbuckle his tank and weight belt. His mask had 
already been torn off. 
</P>
<P>
Another tug by the whale sent him down again. The net was still caught on his 
swim fins. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Talbot, one of the divers from the research ship finally dived 
in and was able to cut him loose. "He saved my life," Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
National Park Service divers later saw the whale off Santa Rosa Island, 
dragging a length of net -- and Talbot's tank, regulator and weight belt. 
</P>
<P>
"They must have wondered what happened," Talbot said. 
</P>
<P>
Such an experience might deter some people from closely involving themselves 
with the creatures of the sea, but Talbot is driven by a genuine concern for 
marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 encounter with the gray whale is merely one he has had with many 
species, in many oceans. 
</P>
<P>
There was the time last March when he was shooting pictures of humpback whales 
off Hawaii, looking with a distorted view through a 14-millimeter lens and 
camera housing. 
</P>
<P>
"They came toward us and seemed a lot farther away," Talbot said. "I'm looking 
and I'm focusing and then I feel this thump in my side, and I thought it was 
the guy I was with. I get kind of frustrated so I try to shake him away. 
</P>
<P>
"But I look down and here's this giant pectoral fin of this humpback whale that 
I'm on top of, and didn't realize. I looked up and there's this huge eye 
staring at me, and I thought, whoops! And she just kind of suspended me there 
on her flipper, almost to hold me at flipper's length . . . and I just hung 
there for about 15 to 20 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Talbot, 31, has traveled the world in pursuit of marine mammals, which he said 
"have this look in their eyes -- a lot of presence" -- that makes them more 
interesting than other animals. 
</P>
<P>
But while his pictures typically show the creatures alive and vibrant in their 
natural habitat, almost all belong to a species in some sort of trouble, 
generally caused by man. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Talbot photographed pilot whales off Denmark's Faroe Islands. The 
whales are the subject of an annual hunt during which they are driven into 
shallow bays and massacred. 
</P>
<P>
"They're slit with knives, kids stick their hands in the blow holes. It's a big 
game for the locals," Talbot said. "They're even trying to set up their beaches 
so it's easier to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Before that it was the harp seals of Canada's Madeleine Islands, clubbed to 
death for their meat and snowy-white fur. 
</P>
<P>
Next on Talbot's agenda is a trip to New Zealand to assist environmental groups 
working to stop the killing of dolphins by tuna fishermen and their nets. 
</P>
<P>
"They're in real trouble over there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What can one man and his camera do for a species in trouble? What does showing 
a dolphin in all its grace and elegance, leaping playfully above the ocean's 
surface do for its future survival? 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm mostly interested in doing is raising awareness," Talbot said. "I 
target issues with posters, with a portion of money going to various groups." 
</P>
<P>
Said longtime friend and diving partner Tony Bernot: "You've got to get people 
interested first. If you did a poster, say of a whale tangled up in a net, 
nobody's going to buy it. But by showing the animals at their best, it still 
allows people to see them, beautiful, in the wild." 
</P>
<P>
Talbot, who started selling his photographs on the street before his career 
took off in the early 1980s, now is able to donate money to organizations he 
believes in -- those that deal with protecting the fragile marine environment. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Sierra Club and the American Cetacean Society have benefited from 
Talbot's work in one way or another. 
</P>
<P>
He makes frequent donations -- of time, photographs and money -- to such 
organizations as the Marine Mammal Fund, Earth Island Institute and England's 
Whale Conservation Society, which regularly uses his photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Said Stan Minasian of the Marine Mammal Fund: "He spent two years in the 
Bahamas filming spotted dolphins in hopes he could sell footage. We were 
working on a film on the dolphin-tuna issue and he contributed everything he 
had -- stills, movie, everything -- to the project. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever we need a publicity photo or whatever, he's there. And he's been that 
same way with many of the environmental groups that he believes in." 
</P>
<P>
Talbot said: "You have to take into consideration the suffering on the part of 
the animals. Not that the oceans are any more important than the homeless or 
any other animals or anything like that -- they all need help. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just that it's what I chose to work on. Basically, all our life comes 
from the sea -- the air we breathe, a lot of the food we eat and even in a 
roundabout way the water we drink. We screw that up, and we're done." 
</P>
<P>
Talbot has been interested in the ocean and its inhabitants since he was a 
child. Growing up inland in Eagle Rock was a minor inconvenience. He and 
friends such as Bernot and Chip Matheson still found their way to the beach as 
often as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"We went diving every weekend," said Bernot, who still assists Talbot on 
occasion. "We rarely ever missed -- even went it was rough." 
</P>
<P>
Bernot's inflatable boat and an underwater camera got Talbot started. 
</P>
<P>
"I got the camera as a gift and thought it'd be fun," he said. "I had a little 
bit of a knack for it, and one thing led to another. I started doing this stuff 
when I was 14." 
</P>
<P>
That "stuff" entailed photographing whales off the Southern California coast 
plus an occasional trip to Monterey for sea otters. 
</P>
<P>
But after graduating from high school Talbot decided to get serious. He wanted 
to swim with killer whales. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to see orcas in the wild. That was our big dream," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Off he went with fellow teen-agers Bernot and Matheson, with a little bit of 
money, an inflatable boat and trailer, and two cars filled with equipment. 
Destination: British Columbia's Johnstone Strait. 
</P>
<P>
After bouncing over an unpaved road for several days after crossing the 
U.S.-Canadian border, they finally arrived and set up camp in a tree-house 
built on a small island on the strait. 
</P>
<P>
It was several more days before any killer whales were sighted, and when they 
finally entered the strait, the three remained in the safety of the boat, 
photographing the whales on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, however, Talbot jumped in. Bernot and Matheson followed. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really incredible. Being that age (19) and trying something that not a 
whole lot of people had done," Bernot said, adding that any fear of the animals 
disappeared immediately after the first encounter. 
</P>
<P>
Talbot's reaction: "We got in the water with orcas, at just 19 years old. I was 
just blown away. Of all the creatures I've photographed, they're still the most 
awe-inspiring." 
</P>
<P>
In one instance, Talbot found himself being circled by a small pod of whales 
for several minutes, before they closed in. 
</P>
<P>
"They just started coming in closer and closer until they were circling right 
on him," according to Bernot, who was watching from the boat. "(Talbot) emerged 
with incredible footage." 
</P>
<P>
Talbot's photograph of the four whales surfacing at dawn, blowing high into the 
air, graced the cover of Audubon magazine. American Photographer picked the 
photograph as one of the 10 best that year. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after that, Talbot approached Karl Bornstein of the Santa Monica-based 
Mirage Editions, who took one look at his work and thought there might be a 
demand for such photographs. 
</P>
<P>
There has been ever since.

The trout have become sluggish and the largemouth bass active at Lake Castaic, 
probably because of the absence of cold weather.

In any case, fishermen have been making the switch in gear and in many cases 
pulling in trophy bass.

GREAT WHITE SHARK LANDED BY ANGLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS

<TEXT>
<P>
It was not an average day's fishing off the Malibu coast for Bill Barlow. 
</P>
<P>
The West Los Angeles resident had been fishing within 50 to 100 feet of the 
coastline off Sunset Beach for the past several days and knew there was 
something big in the water. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday afternoon he proved it. 
</P>
<P>
Using progressively heavier gear each time out, Barlow finally managed -- after 
a 1 1/2-hour fight -- to land a 6 1/2-foot, 297-pound great white shark. 
</P>
<P>
"And there's one out there at least eight feet long and about 500 pounds," 
Barlow said. "We had him right up to our boat before he broke the line. I've 
used progressively heavy tackle until I finally caught this one." 
</P>
<P>
Barlow subdued his shark -- in just 14 feet of water -- using 100-pound test 
monofilament with a 500-pound steel leader and dead mackerel as bait. 
</P>
<P>
Don Nelson, a shark specialist with Cal State Long Beach, said the capture of a 
white shark of that size is not too surprising. "Occasionally the smaller ones 
are caught along the beaches," he said, adding that the chances are slim of a 
much bigger shark looming just off the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"(White sharks) don't get mature until they're 12 to 14 feet and the real big 
ones are normally found near the seal colonies or way out in the deep water," 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
In October 1987, two white sharks slightly bigger than Barlow's were caught off 
the Manhattan Beach coast on the same day. Experts said that was unusual 
because great whites generally travel alone. 
</P>
<P>
It's official. California's trout fishermen will catch fewer fish in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the Department of Fish and Game's proposal to reduce the limit to 
five fish daily in places where it had previously been 10, with 10 allowed in 
possession, was adopted Dec. 21 by the Fish and Game Commission. 
</P>
<P>
While that might appear to be a blow to the fisherman who wants more fish, the 
decision was widely praised by most conservation-oriented groups. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of support (by them)," said Almo Cordone, the DFG's inland 
fisheries management supervisor. Of the individual or unattached fishermen, 
Cordone said, "We'll hear from them when they find out about it." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was designed to spread the trout harvest among more anglers and 
allow the DFG to plant fewer, but larger, trout in public waterways, the DFG 
said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
One major proposal rejected by the commission at the Dec. 21 hearing was one in 
which streams and reservoirs in Inyo and Mono counties would remain open 
year-round. Instead the season will still run from the last Saturday in April 
to Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Other noteworthy changes involving popular Eastern Sierra fisheries: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A zero limit will go into effect on the heavily fished main portion of 
Cottonwood Creek, between the mouth of Little Cottonwood Creek and the mouth of 
the South Fork of Cottonwood Creek, to protect the golden trout fishery. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rush Creek will have special regulations whereby artificial lures only are 
allowed and fish over 10 inches must be released. "It has a big population of 
little fish," Cordone said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The wild-trout section of Hot Creek gains a half-mile, now stretching to 
the DFG hatchery property line. 
</P>
<P>
 -- All trout caught in the East Fork of the Walker River must be at least 14 
inches. The size limit was 18 inches in the upper portion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bear Creek and Deep Creek have an increased size limit from six to eight 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kirman Lake will be restricted to artificial lures, and a 16-inch minimum 
has been established. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, a year-round, zero-limit rule goes into effect from the portion of 
Piru Creek slightly above the old Highway 99 Bridge upstream to the bridge 
slightly below Lake Pyramid. Only artificial lures may be used on that portion 
of the Los Angeles County creek. 
</P>
<P>
There no longer will be a special season on Big Bear Lake's tributaries -- 
fishing will be allowed year-round. 
</P>
<P>
And the Malibu Creek steelhead fishery will open the Saturday after Memorial 
Day and close on Nov. 15 instead of Nov. 30. A zero limit remains in effect. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bag limit at most of Northern California's salmon and 
steelhead streams has been reduced from either three or five, to two. 
</P>
<P>
Cordone said there have been several changes statewide and that the 1990 
sportfishing regulations booklets are available at DFG offices and tackle 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's sportfishers are still plying Mexican waters for yellowtail -- and 
still finding them in large quantities, which is unusual this late in the year. 
</P>
<P>
Caryl Sandner of H&amp;M Landing said fishermen on some of the boats are 
getting their limits -- five fish in Mexican waters -- as early as mid-day. 
</P>
<P>
The boats for the most part are traveling between 40 and 60 miles south of 
Point Loma, and most of the fish are between eight and 12 pounds, with some 
pushing 20. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>
The bald eagle is making a comeback and may be removed from the endangered 
species list, according to Dan James of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "We 
now know of a minimum of 2,590 breeding pairs of bald eagles" in the lower 48 
states, James said. "That probably translates to somewhere between 10,000 and 
12,000 eagles." The banning of the pesticide DDT in 1972 is considered the 
largest single factor. 
</P>
<P>
H. Werner Buck's 25th annual Anaheim Sports, Vacation &amp; RV show will be 
held Jan. 6-14 at the Anaheim Convention Center.

ON JAN. 1, IT WILL EITHER BE COLORADO NO.1 -- OR CHOAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALLY JENKINS, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was the college football season in which Colorado grieved, Notre Dame 
misbehaved, Miami arrived late and Michigan lost early. Dennis Erickson took 
over the Hurricanes, Bo Schembechler opted to quit coaching and Lou Holtz 
babbled nonsense. Their various private sentiments and public posturing were 
diverting. Now comes the purpose in all of this: which team will be No. 1? 
</P>
<P>
Raised at a dinner table, it's a query that can make glasses jump with the 
force of an argumentative fist. Perfectly respectable citizens are suddenly 
struck by paroxysms of feeling that turn their faces the shades of school 
colors. The national champion will be determined by the major bowl games on 
Jan. 1, and there are a good handful of teams with equally justifiable claims, 
all feeling the weight of a ring or seeing the outline of a trophy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's out in front of you. That ring is closer," Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
Matters may be particularly contentious this New Year's Day. In an uncommon 
mess of a year, only No. 1 Colorado went undefeated. The Buffaloes (11-0) will 
meet defending national champion No. 4 Notre Dame (11-1) in the Orange Bowl, 
and a Colorado victory would make everything simple. But a loss would let in 
No. 2 Miami (10-1), which will go against Alabama in the Sugar Bowl, and also 
No. 3 Michigan, which makes its case against Southern California in the Rose 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The right circumstances could occasion the first split news-agency polls since 
1978, when Alabama won No. 1 in the Associated Press but USC took the United 
Press International coaches' vote on the basis of an earlier defeat of the 
Crimson Tide. The similar possibilities this year raise a secondary argument, 
between those who favor a playoff system and those who enjoy the intriguing 
ambiguities of polls and bowls. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that spells instant national championship is if Colorado wins," 
Michigan defensive back Tripp Welborne said. "So to me, whatever comes, comes. 
That's why it's mythical, that's what makes it interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Each team has merits and drawbacks. Michigan was the pre-season No. 1, only to 
lose its opener to Notre Dame, which took over the top place for 11 weeks. 
Miami lost in midseason to archrival Florida State, and the team of the 1980s 
had a confidence crisis. Then the Hurricanes upset the Fighting Irish in the 
last game of the season, breaking their winning streak at 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, Colorado's record grew steadily. The Buffaloes played on 
swelling emotion, dedicating the year to late quarterback Sal Aunese, who died 
of cancer this fall. But their season has to be viewed with some incredulity, 
accomplished under such strange circumstances, and in the weak Big Eight as 
Oklahoma was injury-prone and scandal-troubled and Nebraska was rebuilding. The 
Buffaloes are No. 1 for the first time ever. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't really earn number one," offensive lineman Joe Garten said. "We 
earned number two. Notre Dame was number one and they just gave it to us." 
</P>
<P>
The ranking could be merely on loan. The Buffaloes have never played for a 
national championship, and their sense of purpose may fail them, replaced by 
nerves. The last time they were unbeaten was 1923. This is only their second 
outright Big Eight title, and their first appearance in the Orange since Jan. 
1, 1977. Their school's 11 championships all came in something more appropriate 
for the locale, skiing. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," Coach Bill McCartney said. 
"We couldn't expect to have this good fortune again. It wasn't realistic." 
</P>
<P>
And yet they set 43 school records. Sophomore quarterback Darian Hagan operated 
their option offense with aplomb, only the sixth player in NCAA history to gain 
1,000 yards both passing (1,002) and rushing (1,004). They dashed off 83 plays 
for 20 yards or more. For every easy rout over a lowly team, they pulled off a 
convincing victory against the likes of Texas (27-6), Illinois (38-7) and 
Washington (45-28). 
</P>
<P>
Some observers wonder if the memorializing of Aunese wasn't a bit much: His 
locker was glassed in and places reserved for him at team meals. Nebraska 
players intimated they were milking his death. Garten called the suggestion 
"disgusting," and it may have only redoubled the Buffaloes' determination. 
There is little question they play with genuine conviction, which Notre Dame's 
Holtz considers their scariest quality. 
</P>
<P>
"A sense of purpose takes you to a higher level," Holtz said. "I don't question 
that. It's impressive to an outsider." 
</P>
<P>
If Colorado has the most emotion, Miami has the best timing. The Hurricanes 
lost their purpose for a while under first-year coach Erickson and his 
first-year starter at quarterback, Craig Erickson. The loss to Florida State, 
with Erickson sidelined by a broken thumb, turned them temporarily into a 
fractious team. On his return Erickson made a public scene of yelling at his 
receivers, who criticized him equally. When they weren't arguing, they were 
questioning the new staff or their self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
"We walked around like zombies," offensive lineman Mike Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
But the Hurricanes have played for the national championship in one form or 
another every year since 1986. Dennis Erickson promised them they would have a 
say in the '89 title race, appealing to their bedrock of confidence. One 
victory re-established them, the climactic 27-10 defeat of the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
"You could see it was still workable," defensive back Charles Pharms said. 
</P>
<P>
They received considerable assistance in the rankings when they soared from No. 
7 to No. 2, helped also when then-unbeaten and No. 2 Alabama fell to Auburn in 
its last regular-season game. It put them in the best position a team with one 
loss could ask for, and their Sugar Bowl game against Alabama is arguably an 
easier task than Colorado faces in Notre Dame. They have ironed out problems 
with Dennis Erickson's new one-back offense, and Craig Erickson has regained 
his composure, although he has been persistently troubled by interceptions 
(13). 
</P>
<P>
Their season may be summed up by one remark. "Everything that needed to happen 
did," Sullivan said. "Luck factors into any national championship. Someone gave 
us a hell of a nice gift. I'd like to think it's an omen." 
</P>
<P>
No team got more assistance in the polls than Michigan (10-1), inexplicably 
ranked ahead of Notre Dame despite its 24-19 loss to the Irish Sept. 16. That 
means the Wolverines could win their first national championship ever under 
Schembechler, who will retire immediately after the Rose Bowl game and be 
full-time athletic director. It would take the following: Miami must lose to 
Alabama and Colorado to Notre Dame, but not by much. The Wolverines must 
demolish the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
Those events, plus sentiment for Schembechler, could swing votes their way. But 
the route is too circuitous for Schembechler to place much emphasis on it. 
Their first priority must be to defeat USC, no mean feat in light of their 
dreadful 2-7 history in the Rose under Schembechler. He publicly insists he is 
content with a Big Ten title. 
</P>
<P>
"We've already won a championship; this is icing," he said. "This is not a 
crusade." 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines are not without solid arguments in their favor, however. The 
loss to the Irish came on two flukish kickoff returns for touchdowns by Raghib 
"Rocket" Ismail of 89 and 92 yards. They were forced to go with freshman 
quarterback Elvis Grbac when starter Michael Taylor was injured early. Since 
then they have won 10 straight games, which no other team but Colorado has been 
able to do. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be fitting and nice, but it's not necessary for us to feel 
accomplished," Welborne said. "Things don't turn out sometimes. But this could, 
easily." 
</P>
<P>
While Miami and Michigan benefited from a fortunate convergence of 
circumstances, Notre Dame couldn't have lost at a worse time. Nothing drops a 
team so heavily as a late-season defeat. When the Hurricanes simply crushed the 
Irish, their self-conviction was severely undermined. How will they grapple 
with a loss for the first time in two years, and particularly the notion that 
the title could be beyond their grasp? Even if they defeat the Buffaloes, No. 1 
could swing to the Hurricanes, and Holtz has told them plainly their prospects 
are not good. 
</P>
<P>
"We know we must have help along the way," linebacker Donn Grimm said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss to Miami may have been inevitable when viewed in the context of an 
absolute trial of a season. Perhaps no colossus of a team could have survived 
the Notre Dame schedule of eight bowl teams and the numerous controversies. 
They lost players to disciplinary actions and were criticized for an unsightly 
pre-game brawl with USC. 
</P>
<P>
Holtz acknowledged, "I don't believe we'll get a lot of sentimental votes." 
</P>
<P>
Against Miami they were uninspired. The offense led by option-oriented Tony 
Rice, normally so machine-like, did not score a touchdown. A single play was 
particularly emblematic: On third and 42 from his 7-yard line, Erickson 
completed a bomb for a first down that resulted in a demoralizing scoring 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
"It took time to set in," Grimm said. "We were not accustomed at all to losing. 
Not until we saw the consequence of it, dropping in the polls, did we accept 
it. It was like a nightmare. You hoped you'd wake up and it hadn't happened." 
</P>
<P>
But Notre Dame is not a team that yields easily. The Irish have the added 
advantage that the burden of proof is on Colorado. "I don't believe we've got a 
very good chance for the national championship," Holtz said, but then added 
with typical obfuscation: "If we lose."

FAMILY CANCELS MARTIN AUTOPSY; FUNERAL FRIDAY; 
</P>
<P>
CRASH: CANCELLATION MAY HINDER OFFICIALS IN DETERMINING WHETHER ADDITIONAL 
CHARGES SHOULD BE FILED AGAINST DRIVER OF PICKUP TRUCK.

<TEXT>
<P>
An autopsy on former New York Yankee manager Billy Martin was canceled Tuesday 
at his family's request, and a prosecutor said the decision could make it 
harder to press charges against the driver of the truck in which Martin died. 
</P>
<P>
The Broome County sheriff's department reported slow progress in investigating 
the Christmas night accident that killed Martin, 61, and injured the driver, 
Martin's long-time friend, William Reedy of Detroit. Sheriff Anthony Ruffo said 
it would be another day or two before the alcohol level in Reedy's blood was 
confirmed through laboratory tests. 
</P>
<P>
Reedy was charged Christmas night with a misdemeanor driving-while-intoxicated 
charge and faces a fine of up to $1,000 and a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"In the observation of the deputy, the driver had been drinking to the point 
where he was intoxicated," Ruffo said. "We have to get the results of the blood 
test." 
</P>
<P>
Ruffo added that Reedy voluntarily took the blood-alcohol test. 
</P>
<P>
Broome County District Attorney Gerald Mollen said he hoped to persuade Coroner 
Patrick Ruddy to conduct an autopsy despite the family's wishes in order to 
pinpoint the exact cause of Martin's death. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping that's not the final decision, to tell you the truth," Mollen said. 
"It's unusual that a coroner would not have an autopsy conducted when cause of 
death may be a legal question." 
</P>
<P>
But Ruddy said an autopsy on Martin's body would reveal little that an external 
examination did not. 
</P>
<P>
"He died, basically, of a fractured neck," Ruddy said. "The chest X-ray was 
reasonably intact, belly was normal, blood count was normal. It's all in the 
neck area." 
</P>
<P>
Mollen said it would be "days, at least" before he decides whether or not to 
charge Reedy with anything more serious than driving while intoxicated. He said 
a grand jury would convene next week and one would be in session continuously 
and could take up the case as soon as the investigation was complete. 
</P>
<P>
Further charges could still be brought against Reedy even if an autopsy was not 
conducted, Mollen said. 
</P>
<P>
But the absence of an autopsy report could make it difficult for prosecutors to 
prove in court the exact cause of death should additional charges be filed 
against Reedy. 
</P>
<P>
A viewing for Martin will be Thursday at the Frank Campbell Funeral Home in New 
York. Services will be Friday at St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities say the pickup skidded off an icy road early Monday evening in 
front of Martin's 148-acre farm near Binghamton, located about 150 miles 
northwest of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Reedy, owner of Reedy's Bar near Detroit's Tiger Stadium, suffered a broken hip 
and possible broken ribs in the accident. He was listed in fair condition 
Tuesday at the Upstate Medical Center Hospital in Syracuse, where he was 
transferred after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the two men were not wearing seat belts. 
</P>

UNLV OUTRUNS CS LONG BEACH IN SECOND HALF

Cal State Long Beach's young basketball team came into the Thomas and Mack 
Center Tuesday night to find out if it belonged in the same class as a top 20 
team. Nevada Las Vegas convincingly let the 49ers know that aren't there yet. 
</P>
<P>
The 12th-ranked Runnin' Rebels broke open a tight game with a 19-2 run early in 
the second half and breezed to a 78-58 Big West Conference victory before 
18,600. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, 6-2 overall and 0-1 in the Big West, had hoped to outrun the Rebels 
and win with easy baskets. But it was Las Vegas that did most of the running. 
</P>
<P>
"They beat us down the court and got so many easy baskets," said Long Beach 
Coach Joe Harrington. "And we compounded it by not shooting well." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers made only two baskets from beyond 15 feet. They made only 27.5% from 
the field for the game, only and 20% in the second half. They had shot 49% in 
their first seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the errant shots were launched against a zone defense, rarely used by 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jerry Tarkanian said he decided to abandon his pressure man-to-man 
defense in favor of the zone midway through the first half, specifically to 
stop the drives to the basket by guard Tyrone Mitchell. It worked so well that 
Tarkanian stayed with it the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Our man-to-man defense just didn't work at all," Tarkanian said. "Tyrone 
Mitchell played tremendously for them." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Larry Johnson, the Rebels' new star, scored 17 points and grabbed 14 
rebounds, but it was guard Greg Anthony who impressed Tarkanian the most. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony had 14 points, eight assists and three steals. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he played a super game," Tarkanian said. "He got out on the fast 
break and was a terror out front on defense. His quick hands caused them 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels (6-2, 2-0) led by 31 points late in the second half, running at will 
during a nine-minute period during which Long Beach scored only two points. 
</P>
<P>
A three-point play by Mitchell had closed what had been a nine-point halftime 
lead to 41-37 two minutes into the second half. But then Mitchell lost the ball 
to Anthony, who converted the steal into a layup that began the 19-2 surge. By 
the nine-minute mark, the Rebels had extended their advantage to 60-39. 
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, after dunks by Johnson and Anderson Hunt, the score was 
67-42. 
</P>
<P>
"When they started getting the ball up and down the court we couldn't stop 
them," Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers battled evenly with the Rebels for most of the first half, led by 
freshman guard Lucious Harris, who came off the bench to block a shot and make 
two three-point plays. 
</P>
<P>
Harris wound up with 17 points to lead the 49ers. Mitchell scored 15 and Kevin 
Cutler had 11.

LITHUANIA PEACE MISSION OKD FOR GORBACHEV 
</P>

<P>
The Soviet Communist Party, trying to prevent a far-reaching split in its 
ranks, Tuesday authorized President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other senior 
leaders to undertake a peace mission to the Soviet Baltic republic of 
Lithuania, whose Communist Party declared its independence from Moscow last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
While some members of the Soviet party's policy-making Central Committee had 
demanded the Lithuanians' expulsion, the committee as a whole supported 
Gorbachev in seeking a compromise, party officials said after a two-day 
emergency meeting on the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Vadim A. Medvedev, a member of the party's ruling Politburo and its ideology 
secretary, told a news conference that Gorbachev will travel to Lithuania 
shortly with other members of the Soviet leadership for a series of broad 
discussions with Lithuanian party members. 
</P>
<P>
The 250-member Central Committee will resume its meeting next month to discuss 
what action to take. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the mission as "really a massive campaign, a very serious effort" 
aimed at persuading the 200,000 Lithuanian Communists to remain members of the 
Soviet party, Medvedev said the Central Committee wants "a compromise taking 
into account the real situation in that republic." 
</P>
<P>
"We have to work politically with Communists in Lithuania to find out 
everything there," he said, "and on the basis of that understanding, to find a 
solution." 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev said the Central Committee had fully endorsed Gorbachev's rejection of 
the Lithuanian action at a party congress last week as a blow to "our hopes and 
plans for renewing socialist society in the spirit of humanism and democracy." 
He added that the committee supports the Soviet leader's assertion of the need 
for "a single, firm and powerful Soviet Union" to ensure the country's progress 
as well as international stability. 
</P>
<P>
But committee members, even after two days of debate, were deeply divided on 
how to respond to the Lithuanian move, which threatens the Communist Party's 
sacred principle of party unity as well as posing an unprecedented challenge to 
the country's central leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev said that a number of the 46 speakers at the meeting demanded the 
abrogation of the Lithuanian action and the expulsion from the Soviet party of 
the Lithuanian leadership. But he said others had called with equal vigor for 
an understanding of the situation in Lithuania, where the party faces a tough 
election in two months, and had urged a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The debate was so sharp and bitter, in fact, that only Gorbachev's report -- 
and, presumably, his concluding speech -- will be published, lest the comments 
of the other speakers expose the deep rifts within the leadership and further 
inflame passions. 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian question, however, is of crucial importance for the Soviet 
Communist Party, because this is the first time in nearly 70 years that the 
central leadership has faced such a major factional challenge. At issue is not 
only the independence of the Lithuanian Communists as a national party but also 
the political philosophy, program and tactics that they will follow. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, speaking Monday to the Central Committee, made clear that the entire 
party's future is in the balance as he rejected the Lithuanians' declaration of 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
"No part of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is entitled to decide the 
question of its independent existence on the basis of its own program and rules 
without taking into account the positions of the Soviet Communist Party as a 
whole," he said. "This means that the Lithuanian Communist Party remains an 
integral part of the single Communist Party of the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
He warned that the Soviet leadership "will not permit the breakup of the 
federal state" but will seek, as he has said before, to restructure the Soviet 
state as a true federation of constituent republics, each having maximum 
autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev, briefing journalists at the end of the two-day session, emphasized 
the party's commitment to a peaceful resolution of the present crisis and ruled 
out any use of force by Moscow to impose its will on the rebellious 
Lithuanians. 
</P>
<P>
"We are against military means," Medvedev declared as correspondents pressed 
him on how the central party leadership would prevent this political schism 
from turning into full-scale secession. "In this case, as well as in others, we 
stand for political methods of solving all problems, and we will use them to 
solve problems in the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
But Medvedev warned, as Gorbachev had done, that the leadership is preparing 
legislation to curb secessionist movements. "The Soviet leadership, party and 
state, will take the necessary measures to prevent the disintegration of the 
Soviet Union," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Calls for Lithuania's secession had greatly alarmed the central leadership, he 
continued, and the Lithuanian party's declaration of independence from the 
Soviet Communist Party had "removed the major barrier to prevent separatist, 
secessionist tendencies." 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian action had already brought many warnings that the Communist 
Party and the Soviet Union itself are on the road to dissolution, and 
nationalists in other republics -- including Lithuania's neighbors, Estonia and 
Latvia; Armenia and Georgia in the south, and recently, Moldavia, Byelorussia 
and the Ukraine -- have been watching Lithuania's fate closely. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining legislation proposed by Gorbachev to prohibit groups from advocating 
secession, Medvedev said: "The constitution contains the right to 
self-determination, including the right of secession, but it does not include 
anything about the right to promote secession. One thing is a constitutional 
norm; the other is a matter of public policy." 
</P>
<P>
There were also "quite evident differences" between the situation in Lithuania 
and other Soviet republics, which are seeking various forms of autonomy, 
sovereignty and independence, and the dramatic political transformation under 
way in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a distinction between these issues -- one involves the internal 
affairs of foreign countries and the other the domestic affairs of the Soviet 
Union as a single union of republics," Medvedev said, stressing the party's 
need to take a firm stand on the future of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev said the party leadership hopes to resolve the problem before the end 
of January, when the Central Committee is scheduled to hold a major meeting on 
plans for the national party congress next October. That session will discuss 
proposed changes in the party platform, including far-reaching questions of 
future philosophy and policy and the reorganization of the party structure. 
</P>
<P>
Rejecting suggestions that the Central Committee has shown itself too 
politically divided to act, Medvedev stressed the desire for compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"For the time being, we do not have a full assessment of the Lithuanian party 
congress," he said. "This will be made after members of the Politburo and 
Central Committee go to Lithuania and have their discussions. We will then be 
able to understand the situation in the republic better, and we will have 
firsthand information taking into account the real situation there. Our 
discussion will then . . . allow us to find a way out." 
</P>
<P>
But Medvedev described the Lithuanian action as "a step that disrupts the unity 
of the party" and added, "Efforts must now be made to prevent a chain reaction 
from occurring." 
</P>
<P>
The danger comes, he suggested, not only from nationalists in other republics 
but from conservatives who used the action as a basis for their opposition to 
perestroika, as Gorbachev's political and economic restructuring is known. 
</P>
<P>
"Steps like that do discredit practical work on perestroika, and they can serve 
as the basis for conservative attacks on perestroika," he said. "Here we are 
dealing with the negative aftereffects -- that's self-evident -- and the 
positive results are not visible. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"This also encourages other forces (advocating) anti-democratic methods. . . . 
Is this the road to democracy or to authoritarian methods? This time of 
tensions and aggravation tempts people to apply anti-democratic methods." 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev was extremely sensitive, however, to any suggestion that the admitted 
divisions in the Central Committee implied criticism of Gorbachev. Barely two 
weeks ago, the party leader had been ambushed by conservatives critical of his 
reform policies and had silenced them only with a warning that he would resign 
if he lost the committee's confidence. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting had been "unanimous" in support of Gorbachev's "assessments and 
conclusions," he said, and that unanimity included the Lithuanian participants. 
</P>
<P>
In Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, an estimated 10,000 people gathered in the 
square before the cathedral in support of their party leadership and the 
independence of the Lithuanian Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
But Algirdas Brazauskas, the Lithuanian party first secretary, told Lithuanian 
Radio that the Central Committee decision to send a mission to the republic was 
"good and helpful." 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev rejected as "tactical and not a matter of principle" the basic 
Lithuanian argument for the independence of its Communist Party -- that the 
party's prestige is so low that it is in danger of losing power in the February 
republic elections and that only through establishing its independence from 
Moscow can it regain its influence.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a shift from 20 years of political detachment from the Soviet Union, a 
longtime ally of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was named Tuesday as 
provisional president of Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Romanian national television reported that Ion Iliescu, 59, a veteran Communist 
Party official considered by many to be "Gorbachev's man in Romania," will 
serve as "provisional president of the Provisional Council" of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Named as vice president of the ruling council was human rights activist Dimitru 
Mazilu, author of a scathing United Nations report on human rights abuses under 
the regime of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, state television showed the first film of the executed bodies of 
Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, who for 24 years wielded absolute power over the 
totalitarian police state sometimes described as a mixture of Stalinism and 
Byzantium. 
</P>
<P>
They were shot by a three-man firing squad in a dank, rain-soaked courtyard at 
4 p.m. on Christmas Day. Their bodies, still wrapped in overcoats and scarfs, 
were shown slumped at the base of a crumbling plaster wall. 
</P>
<P>
Elena Ceausescu reportedly told the firing squad assembled to execute them: "We 
want to die together, we do not want mercy." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Mihai Lupoi, who briefed reporters on the Ceausescus' last hours, said 
soldiers had been asked to volunteer for the squad. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody volunteered," he said, adding that it had to be chosen by lot from 
about 300 men. 
</P>
<P>
As the two were led out for execution, Elena said to the soldiers: "I was like 
a mother to you," Lupoi said. 
</P>
<P>
"What sort of a mother were you, who killed our mothers?" one soldier replied. 
</P>
<P>
Television also showed film of an unrepentant Ceausescu arguing angrily at the 
army tribunal Monday. "I will answer nothing. I will sign nothing. I will not 
recognize this court," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a dark suit and a black overcoat, Ceausescu looked gaunt and tired 
but smiled as a man in a white coat checked his blood pressure. No explanation 
was given for the test. 
</P>
<P>
The new government's prime minister, Petre Roman, said the executions may have 
been a "mistake" but added that "there were pressures." Interviewed on French 
television, Roman said the army feared Ceausescu loyalists would try to rescue 
the dictator if he were not killed. 
</P>
<P>
Roman, a professor at Bucharest Polytechnic University, led the takeover of the 
state television and radio networks, which proved to be a critical factor in 
Ceausescu's downfall last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Picked as minister of defense was Col. Gen. Nicolai Militaru, retired commander 
of the Bucharest garrison, one of the first military men to appear on the 
liberated television station in support of the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement marked the first important shakedown of the new National 
Salvation Front government, which up to now had functioned as an unwieldy 
committee of 39 widely diverse people, ranging from religious charismatics to 
movie actors and Communist Party members. 
</P>
<P>
Given the absence of organized political parties in the country, reaction to 
the new government was hard to gauge. 
</P>
<P>
Several hours after the names were announced on state television, several 
hundred angry demonstrators gathered on the central Plaza of the Republic, 
outside the former headquarters of the Romanian Communist Party, shouting, 
"Lies! Lies!" and "We want democracy without communism!" 
</P>
<P>
A group of dissidents, some of whom had been jailed under the Communists, 
denounced the new government for its heavy reliance on top Ceausescu-era 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Washington moved quickly to recognize the new Romanian leadership. U.S. 
Ambassador Alan Green presented the Romanian Foreign Ministry with an official 
statement welcoming the new government as the "manifestation of the political 
will of the Romanian people." 
</P>
<P>
Aid Pouring In 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Iliescu has tentatively set a meeting with the American envoy 
today, in part to discuss distribution of massive amounts of medical and food 
aid that have poured into the country since the uprising began Dec. 16 in 
Timisoara, a western Romanian city of 300,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Although American officials appeared pleased with the new leadership, the main 
long-term beneficiary may be the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Romania has been a 
thorn in the side of Soviet foreign policy. In 1968, Ceausescu was the only 
Warsaw Pact leader who refused to participate in the military operation in 
Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Under Ceausescu, Romania opposed the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and 
refused to support the Soviet-backed regime in Cambodia. It was the only Soviet 
Bloc country to participate in the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Ceausescu's maverick anti-Soviet stance on foreign affairs, the 
United States for years ignored widespread internal human rights abuses under 
the totalitarian police state. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1987, the United States granted Romania "most favored nation" trading 
status that gave the Ceausescu regime a range of tariffs and interest-payment 
concessions. As the Cold War melted under Gorbachev, however, Romania lost its 
usefulness as a thorn in the Soviet side. Citing gross human rights violations, 
the United States withdrew the special trade status in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the Soviet Union was willing to ignore Romania's rebellion on 
foreign policy. As long as the Ceausescu regime remained harsh and cruel, the 
Soviets did not have to face the scary prospect of Romanian nationalism jumping 
across their borders into Soviet Moldavia, where the majority of the population 
speaks Romanian and shares ethnic traditions with their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ceausescu occasionally attempted to appeal to Romanian nationalism 
across the Pru River in Soviet Moldavia, it never was attractive to Moldavians, 
who viewed the Bucharest regime as more onerous than their own. 
</P>
<P>
With Romania finally on the road to reform, Moscow needs a friend in Bucharest, 
and many here believe they have found one in Iliescu, the interim Romanian 
president. Intelligent, fluent in Russian and English, Iliescu's major flaw 
appears to be his longtime affiliation with the Communist Party here, although 
he is generally considered a dissident within the party. 
</P>
<P>
According to diplomats here, Iliescu befriended Gorbachev when they were 
university students in Moscow and attended international Communist youth 
meetings together. 
</P>
<P>
Rose in Ranks 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from the Polytechnical Institute in Moscow, Iliescu was a 
powerful leader in the Romanian Communist Party until he criticized Ceausescu 
at a party conference in 1972. After that, he was removed from the party's 
Central Committee and given a series of minor jobs in the government, most 
recently as director of the central publication house. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, he again demonstrated a break with Ceausescu when he published a 
full-page article in a literary weekly, Romania Literara, calling for greater 
freedom of information and the liberalization of social and political 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
"Iliescu has always been waiting in the wings," one Western diplomat here said. 
"He is widely known as Gorbachev's man in Romania. They attended meetings 
together in Moscow in the 1950s." 
</P>
<P>
Rebuilding leadership in a political void after the 14-year dictatorship of 
Ceausescu is proving to be very difficult here. 
</P>
<P>
"In Romania, you start from scratch," one diplomat said. "In East Germany and 
Czechoslovakia, you at least had some kind of government that was able to serve 
during the transition. Ceausescu was alone. Once he was gone, there was nothing 
left." 
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday, it was clear that the committee of 39 people that had been hastily 
patched together to form the National Salvation Front was no longer functioning 
as a unit. Several members had quit and were planning new political parties. At 
least four new parties have emerged in the four days after Ceausescu's fall. 
</P>
<P>
The streets were much calmer Tuesday in Bucharest and, according to reports, in 
other Romanian cities, than on any day in the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, estimates of people killed in the days of fighting here were greatly 
diminished Tuesday. Officials at the Ministry of Health estimated that 500 
people died on the streets of Bucharest, not the thousands mentioned in some 
news accounts. 
</P>
<P>
In Timisoara, where leaders of the uprising had once estimated 4,666 deaths, 
only 20 bodies have so far been shown to reporters, and several of those 
appeared to have been dead for many months, not a matter of days. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats said Tuesday that they believe the overall death toll from 
fighting across the nation is more than 1,000, but they conceded that no one 
has been able to provide a documented number.

NO EVIDENCE OF NORIEGA SECRET AGAINST BUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

WASHINGTON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"George Bush is my friend," deposed dictator Manuel A. Noriega once told an 
interviewer. "I hope he becomes President." 
</P>
<P>
Some friendship. For almost two years, ever since two U.S. grand juries 
indicted him on drug-trafficking charges, the former Panamanian leader has 
gleefully launched rumors that he holds some dark secret over the President's 
head, dating either from Bush's year as director of the CIA or from his eight 
years as vice president. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech during the U.S. presidential campaign last year, Noriega derided 
American efforts to negotiate him out of power as an attempt to protect Bush's 
White House bid. 
</P>
<P>
And now, Noriega's sly hints have led to speculation that Bush does not really 
want to bring him to trial -- even though the President deployed more than 
25,000 troops in Panama to oust the former dictator. 
</P>
<P>
But despite two years of rumors and allegations, no evidence has surfaced to 
support the idea of a secret Bush-Noriega connection. 
</P>
<P>
Bush himself has called the stories "total lies." 
</P>
<P>
A Democratic-led congressional committee spent more than a year investigating 
Noriega's drug operations and found nothing solid that pointed to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"On the Bush connection, all we could find were rumors," a senior investigator 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of reporters and other congressional investigators have combed through 
records and chased down witnesses, and all have come up empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
"If Noriega had something on Bush, he would have used it before now," argued 
Nestor Sanchez, a former senior CIA officer in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, some investigators and other officials believe that whatever "secrets" 
Noriega once knew about Bush may already have been included in the flood of 
revelations that followed the discovery of the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"What can Noriega say that's going to be so dangerous?" Sanchez asked. "That he 
was on the CIA payroll? That's already been reported. That he met with George 
Bush? That's been acknowledged. That he helped (convicted former White House 
aide) Ollie North? That's out there too." 
</P>
<P>
Still worrisome to some U.S. officials is the possibility that Noriega, if he 
goes on trial in the United States, might attempt to reveal what he knows about 
CIA secret operations in Panama and elsewhere in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
But officials familiar with the case say even that issue is no longer a major 
concern. "We crossed that bridge a long time ago," one senior official said. 
"We don't think Noriega knows anything that we would find all that 
embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the issue has been a long-running embarrassment for Bush -- if only 
because, as CIA director and as vice president, he was caught in the middle of 
an official relationship with Noriega that went spectacularly, and painfully, 
sour. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, when Democratic presidential candidate Michael S. Dukakis attacked 
Bush for "involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy," Bush responded 
by referring testily to that long history. 
</P>
<P>
"Seven Administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega," he said. "It was the 
Reagan-Bush Administration that brought this man to justice." 
</P>
<P>
And, ever since, aides have noted that Bush has taken his confrontation with 
Noriega on an unusually personal level. "I've been frustrated that he's been in 
power so long -- extraordinarily frustrated," Bush said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega worked with the CIA, the U.S. military and the Drug Enforcement 
Administration beginning about 1969, when he became an intelligence officer in 
Panama's National Guard, according to former officials. For part of that time, 
he was a paid "asset" of the CIA and received tens of thousands of dollars for 
his services. 
</P>
<P>
But during the same period, U.S. officials slowly discovered, Noriega was also 
working for major South American cocaine smuggling rings, for the intelligence 
service of Communist Cuba -- and for himself.

CEAUSESCU, DEFIANT TO END, LECTURED MILITARY TRIBUNAL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, went to their deaths by firing 
squad defiantly spurning the right of their military accusers to judge them. 
</P>
<P>
"I will be judged only by the people," Ceausescu repeatedly told the military 
prosecutor in a videotaped Romanian television broadcast late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The television did not show the couple's faces when their death sentence was 
pronounced, but Ceausescu was heard clearly to say: "It doesn't matter. It has 
no importance." 
</P>
<P>
The hourlong videotape of the final hours of the couple who ruled Romania with 
an iron hand for 24 years showed Ceausescu, 71, arguing angrily at the army 
tribunal Monday, and declaring in a loud voice: "I do not recognize this court. 
Read the constitution." 
</P>
<P>
"We've read the constitution," an off-screen voice answered. "We know it better 
than you." 
</P>
<P>
"I will not answer a single question," Ceausescu said. 
</P>
<P>
The film ended with a final vignette of Ceausescu lying on his back alongside 
his wife in front of a concrete wall, his eyes open and blood oozing from a 
head wound. 
</P>
<P>
The television never showed his accusers, but it broadcast their voices. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu, wearing a black coat, and his wife sat at a table in a sparsely 
furnished room. 
</P>
<P>
At one stage, challenged on what he had done for society, Ceausescu said: "I 
built hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
Questioned about food shortages, he curtly retorted: "The people have 200 kilos 
(440 pounds) of corn. . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Who ordered the shooting of the people?" the interrogator asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not answer a single question," Ceausescu replied. "Do not interpret my 
silence as answers. 
</P>
<P>
"I will only answer to the working class," said Ceausescu, who often stared at 
the ceiling. "I will tell the people. I will answer to the working class. 
</P>
<P>
"The people should fight to destroy this band which together with foreign 
powers wants to destroy the country and has carried out a coup," Ceausescu 
screamed, pointing frantically with his finger. 
</P>
<P>
He often wagged his finger in the lecturing gesture that was a hallmark of the 
hectoring profile he adopted throughout his political life. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu emotionally waved his hand up and down and said he would answer only 
to Parliament. Elena occasionally smiled and mumbled. 
</P>
<P>
"What possessed you to reduce the people to the state they are in?" the 
interrogator asked. "Not even the peasants had enough wheat and had to come to 
Bucharest to buy bread. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did the people have to starve?" 
</P>
<P>
"This is a lie," Ceausescu said. "Think carefully. It is a lie and proves the 
lack of patriotism currently in the country." 
</P>
<P>
"You destroyed the Romanian people and their economy," the interrogator said. 
"Such things are unheard of in the civilized world." 
</P>
<P>
"We do not intend to argue with you," Ceausescu said. "The population had 
everything it needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I will answer only to the people's parliament in connection with treason and 
the coup and how things happened in Romanian history, and you will all answer 
to the people," Ceausescu said. 
</P>
<P>
Elena stared absently, with apparent lack of interest. She seemed exhausted and 
was slumped against the wall in her chair most of the time. But sometimes her 
eyes darted back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you let them speak to you like that?" she said at one point. "Will you 
allow them to speak to an academician in such a way?" 
</P>
<P>
"Let Elena Ceausescu tell us about the costs of publishing her books abroad," 
the off-screen voice said. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave my entire life for my people," she said angrily, making chopping 
motions with her hand. "Our people." 
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of the actions of the members of the Ceausescu family, we condemn 
the two of you to death," the off-screen voice said. "We confiscate all your 
property." 
</P>
<P>
There followed a freeze-frame, and the accused pair's reactions were not 
visible. 
</P>
<P>
"Please enter into the minutes that all the conditions exist to bring a verdict 
of guilty," the voice said. 
</P>
<P>
The off-screen voice, in an angry and decisive tone, then listed the articles 
under which the two were found guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to get you a lawyer," the voice said. "Your crimes were such that you 
merit the biggest penalty." 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu tried to comfort his wife by touching her hand. She looked down and 
licked her lips. 
</P>
<P>
"It is sad that you do not wish to confess the crimes you have committed 
against the Romanian people," the voice said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have not only deprived the people of bread and heating, but you imprisoned 
the Romanian spirit, which could not express itself in any way. You took oxygen 
from the wounded," the voice continued. 
</P>
<P>
"Your terrorists supplied themselves in the underground and opposed the people. 
You have drained us. . . . You call on the people. How can you face this very 
people?" 
</P>
<P>
Elena laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"This laugh says all that needs to be said about you," the voice said. "On the 
basis of your behavior, you belong in a madhouse. The two of you, if you beg my 
pardon, should listen to what I am saying." 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu throughout the trial often turned his head back and forth like a 
trapped animal. 
</P>
<P>
"You have nothing to say about the revolution? The blood spilled in Timisoara?" 
the voice said, referring to the reported massacre of thousands of 
anti-government demonstrators that sparked the current unrest 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu stood up. "I can only be accused by the people's parliament. You are 
putschists, the destroyers of Romania's independence." He sat down again. 
</P>
<P>
"I was respected when I went to the factories . . . " But the voice interrupted 
him before he could finish. 
</P>
<P>
When ordered to stand, Ceausescu and his wife refused. 
</P>
<P>
"It is unanimously decided that Ceausescu Nicolae and Ceausescu Elena be given 
the maximum sentence for genocide against the Romanian people and the 
destruction of the Romanian land," the voice said. 
</P>
<P>
"I refuse to recognize this court," Ceausescu declared. 
</P>
<P>
The footage stopped. 
</P>
<P>
Then shots of Ceausescu's bloodstained corpse, previously shown on television, 
were screened again. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE ROMANIA STORY 
</P>
<P>
The Executions 
</P>
<P>
Romanian television shows videotape of deposed leader Nicolae Ceausescu and his 
wife, Elena, after they were executed by a firing squad for crimes against 
Romania. Earlier, television showed footage of the couple at what is believed 
to have been their secret trial. 
</P>
<P>
The Government 
</P>
<P>
The revolutionary council names its informal leader, Ion Iliescu, a former 
official ousted by Ceausescu, as chairman of the governing council. It also 
names Petre Roman, a 43-year-old professor of hydraulic engineering with no 
political background, as prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Policy 
</P>
<P>
The United States quickly recognizes the new Romanian leadership. U.S. 
Ambassador Alan Green presents the Romanian Foreign Ministry with an official 
statement welcoming the new government as the "manifestation of the political 
will of the Romanian people."

CRIME: A CHICAGO MAN ALLEGEDLY SHOT HIS CRIPPLED WIFE BECAUSE HE FEARED HE

<P>
A retired Chicago policeman who allegedly killed his crippled wife on Christmas 
Eve, saying he feared he would not be able to care for her after he undergoes 
heart surgery, was released on bond Tuesday. He faces first-degree murder 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Williams, 67, shot his wife of 44 years in the head with a .38-caliber 
revolver as she sat in her wheelchair and then called police to confess and 
turn over the murder weapon, authorities said. Alice Williams, 64, able to 
control only the muscles in her right hand after a 20-year-long battle with 
multiple sclerosis, was totally dependent on her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"She'd been failing right along the last six months. She lost a lot of weight 
and recently lost muscle control of her face," said Marie Kitzmiller, who lives 
next door to the Williams' house on the southwest side of Chicago. "He was 
completely dedicated to her," Kitzmiller said. 
</P>
<P>
"His wife was completely dependent upon him for vital care," said Police Sgt. 
George Owen. "She was totally helpless and in considerable pain." Williams told 
investigators that his wife had begged him to end her life. 
</P>
<P>
At a preliminary hearing Tuesday, Cook County Circuit Judge David Erickson 
postponed additional hearings until after the New Year and released Williams in 
the custody of his only child, Alice Kyle, on a $250,000 personal bond. 
</P>
<P>
Williams had served as a bodyguard to former Chicago Mayors Richard J. Daley 
and Jane M. Byrne and had received a department commendation and 30 honorable 
mentions during his 28-year tenure with the Chicago police force. 
</P>
<P>
"His health wasn't the best and hers was deteriorating," said police Sgt. 
Ronald Palmer, who noted that Williams had undergone a heart operation two 
years ago but recently learned that the problem had recurred and that he faced 
additional surgery. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he would be unable to take care of his wife and himself," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams told police that "all his wife did was complain about how much she was 
suffering, and she begged him to end it," Palmer added. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' daughter told police she had spoken to her father earlier Sunday and 
that he told her his doctor had advised him that he required a second major 
heart operation and he wouldn't be able to care for his wife, Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very nice man," said Chester Ciezczak, a neighbor. "He seemed to 
always help his wife . . . . He cared for her very much." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Williams nor his daughter answered their phones on Tuesday. Williams' 
attorney, Matthew J. Carmody, did not return phone calls.

PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Streets filled with cars and people returned to work Tuesday for the first time 
since U.S. troops invaded six days ago and life appeared to be returning to 
normal -- but it was a different form of normalcy. 
</P>
<P>
It is a normalcy of counting the days of former dictator Manuel A. Noriega's 
bunkered existence inside the walled Vatican embassy, where he sought sanctuary 
Sunday as diplomats in Washington and Rome negotiate whether he will be turned 
over to the United States or given political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
The new normalcy also is evident in the pervasive presence of U.S. soldiers in 
nearly all aspects of life. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers in full combat gear, faces painted in unearthly green and their 
helmets covered with ragged strips of old fatigues, randomly stopped and 
searched pedestrians, frequently at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Ambulances, their emergency lights flashing and sirens sounding as they rushed 
patients to hospitals, are forced to a halt by U.S. troops demanding 
identification and searching inside the vehicles because of reports that 
Noriega loyalists are disguising themselves as victims of illness. 
</P>
<P>
Normalcy Tuesday included an American patrol walking through the intersection 
of Via Argentina and Via Espana, perhaps the city's busiest crossroads, at the 
height of the morning rush hour firing several rounds into the air without 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
There was an unreal quality to the seemingly high volume of traffic in the 
city. Employees turned up in offices and stores to find windows shattered by 
vandals and shops emptied by looters. 
</P>
<P>
Although a few workers were busy nailing plywood panels to empty window and 
door frames and others swept debris into the streets, most employees either 
were sent home or stood in front of shattered storefronts, bewildered and 
speculating about who was going to fix things. 
</P>
<P>
As is often the case here, the assumed answer was the United States. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who owns a folk art store said in an interview, "It's wonderful that 
the United States drove out Noriega. Now, do you think the United States will 
give me the money to fix my store?" 
</P>
<P>
Even as the American military intervention continued, the new government tried 
Tuesday to assume the role of a normal regime. First, it swore in the new, 
12-member national Cabinet. However, it would not disclose the names of the 
officials because of "security reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Then it was announced that the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew initially imposed by the 
Americans was changed to 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. and applied only to vehicles. Also, 
the first of the country's new police force were ordered into place at some 
government ministries. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the curfew still will be enforced by U.S. soldiers and the most 
important ministry, housing the presidential offices, will be guarded by 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
When an American army patrol showed up Tuesday to check out reports that a 
pro-Noriega gunman was hiding inside, the two Panamanian officers stationed in 
front of the building took one look at the heavily armed American troops and 
scuttled quickly into the shadows of a nearby doorway. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want them to see me," Sgt. Julio Caranza said. "If they want to take 
over this building, it's OK with me. It's their country for now."

A jailed leader of the outlawed Communist Party escaped from a maximum-security

Wilma Tiamzon, wife of party Chairman Benito Tiamzon, escaped Monday during 
Christmas celebrations inside Camp Crame, the Philippine Constabulary

<TEXT>
<P>
In his penultimate speech, Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu boasted that 
Soviet-style reform would come to his country "when apple trees grow pears." 
Historians may well record the phrase as the one that finally precipitated his 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
In the days that followed, theater and cinema students in Bucharest hung all 
the pears they could find on the barren December trees that lined the capital's 
main street. 
</P>
<P>
The taunt so infuriated Ceausescu that he ordered his Securitate secret police 
to identify the perpetrators and attack the students in their dormitories last 
Thursday, killing many of them. Other students took to the university square, 
where more than 100 were slaughtered that night. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, students organized by a popular actor named Ion Caramitru began 
the catcalls that interrupted the final Ceausescu speech, triggering his flight 
and the mass uprising that followed. 
</P>
<P>
If drama students were able to topple one government, however, they may be 
singularly unprepared to install another. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the National Salvation Front, the provisional government, 
originally was a loosely formed, polyglot collection of actors, poets, writers, 
film directors, military officers, student leaders and former Communist Party 
officials. No single member can boast a national political stature. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a government of poets but a government of actors," said Vladimir 
Tismaneanu, a resident scholar at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in 
Philadelphia. It was Tismaneanu who learned during a phone call Christmas night 
from Romania of the pears on the apple trees. 
</P>
<P>
And although the front's management experience is severely lacking, it faces 
tremendous obstacles as it tries to run the country, feed its people and 
prepare for democratic elections in April. 
</P>
<P>
Its economic program was described vaguely by Ion Grigorescu, a writer and 
filmmaker, as "an open market with the laws of the open market." Beyond that, 
little is known. 
</P>
<P>
"We live at the moment of 1776," he said, alluding to the American Revolution. 
"Could you ask George Washington (at that time) how he was going to make his 
government? He had to learn from his people." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be messy for a while," predicted Stephen Szabo of the National 
Defense University here. "No neat solutions. They say about 30% of all 
Romanians worked or were associated with the Ceausescu regime. If the new 
government gets too pristine and gets rid of all of them, it will be real 
chaos." 
</P>
<P>
After the upheavals in Hungary in 1956 and in Czechoslovakia in 1968, the 
Communist regimes imposed by Soviet tanks purged officials at factories, 
institutes, agencies and other organizations down through the third and even 
fourth levels of authority. 
</P>
<P>
Inexperienced loyalists replaced purged officials, and both nations began 
economic declines from which they have yet to recover. It took the loyalists 
time to gain experience. Also, the governments then would not employ young, 
newly educated experts if their ideas were not rooted in old Communist 
ideology, according to Czechoslovak and Hungarian officials who were 
interviewed recently. 
</P>
<P>
Today, at least three political parties are taking shape in Romania, and a half 
dozen more are expected to follow. 
</P>
<P>
"Some will be parties of nostalgia," said Tismaneanu, such as a national 
peasants party and a party for ethnic Hungarians in Transylvania, both of which 
existed before World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"There will also be a resurgence of the far right, a nationalist party that 
will be revenge-seeking against Communists and also anti-Semitic," he added, 
"but I think it will be marginal." The Communist Party will probably change its 
name, as it has elsewhere in East Europe, while it tries to win elections. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts worry about a military-led takeover, particularly since Romania 
has no tradition of democracy and the nation will suffer considerable economic 
hardship in coming months. But others foresee disorderly democracy. 
</P>
<P>
"We shouldn't be too pessimistic about the absence of democratic experience," 
Szabo said. "If anything, I worry about excessive pluralism. The peoples of 
Eastern Europe, after 40 years, are going to enjoy, even glory in, diversity 
for awhile." 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that even parties with few differences will avoid banding together 
because coalitions were forced upon them by the discredited and oppressive 
Communist regimes. 
</P>
<P>
And reports indicate that infighting may already be occurring in the National 
Front. After talking to front members in Bucharest, for example, Tismaneanu 
said that "there are almost no representatives of real dissent on the council, 
just Gorbachevites or maybe Andropovites, ready to steal the revolution from 
those who made it." 
</P>
<P>
He was alluding to those seeking to reform communism in the style of Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Gorbachev's mentor was an earlier Soviet 
leader, Yuri V. Andropov, who also had once run the Soviet KGB secret police. 
</P>
<P>
The brightest spot in Romania's economy is that the country has the least 
foreign debt of any East European nation, thanks to the Draconian economic 
measures imposed by Ceausescu. He paid off most of the nation's $21 billion in 
loans because he did not want foreign banks to have any leverage on his 
grandiose, Stalin-like agricultural and industrial programs. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, other East European nations will be competing for available 
foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
"Western banks will probably see East Germany and Czechoslovakia as better bets 
for investment," said John Lampe, a University of Maryland economic specialist 
on the region. "I don't think private capital will rush into Romania. Economic 
recovery will depend on government-to-government help, or in the long term, on 
creation of joint ventures among several East European nations that will 
attract private money." 
</P>
<P>
The United States on Tuesday donated $500,000 to the Red Cross for humanitarian 
purposes in Romania, but it is a meager amount compared to the need. West 
European nations, particularly France with its large Romanian exile population, 
are expected to offer more significant economic aid in coming days.

IMMIGRANT, RELIEF GROUPS PREPARE MEDICAL SHIPMENT FOR ROMANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Romanian immigrant organization in Los Angeles County and a Santa 
Barbara-based medical relief group are preparing a $250,000 aid package to be 
sent to Bucharest this week, an official of Direct Relief International said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
While casualties from the fighting in Romania remain unknown, reports of those 
requiring medical treatment are reaching into the hundreds of thousands, said 
Jean Hay, spokeswoman for the group. 
</P>
<P>
With news of the reopening of the airport in Bucharest on Tuesday, the Santa 
Barbara group is hurrying to ready its first shipment of medical supplies, Hay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Antiseptics, anesthetic, bandages, sutures and other pharmaceutical equipment 
will be then flown to Romania via Frankfurt, West Germany, she said. A Yugoslav 
airline has agreed to provide free transportation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrangements to ship the cargo were made by the Romanian Relief Society in the 
City of Commerce, officials said. It is continuing to request financial support 
from the public. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1977, the two groups delivered 1,000 pounds of pharmaceutical 
materials to Red Cross workers in Romania, Hay said. Most of the supplies to be 
shipped out this week are expected to be distributed by volunteer church 
workers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are absolutely swamped," Hay added. "We're trying to take care of Panama 
too." For information: (805) 687-3694.

FAMILY HEARS MORE BAD NEWS FROM ROMANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the State Department sought unsuccessfully to confirm reports of an Orange 
County resident's violent weekend death in Romania, his family got word Tuesday 
that the man's brother was also wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Ionel (John) Antimie, 21, of Fullerton, said they received word 
that he had been killed while trying to bring food and medical aid to friends 
and family. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, they now think from the reports of friends in Romania that his 
brother, Constantine, 32, was wounded Monday by gunfire from government 
security forces while retrieving John's body near the city of Cluj-Napoca. 
</P>
<P>
But details remain sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
"At this very moment, we don't know how bad shape he's in, where or what, 
because we haven't been able to get through to Romania ourselves," said a 
family member.

BUCHAREST, Romania 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the gloomy dusk of this city without lights, candles along the boulevards 
dance in the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
The glow of the small flames is eerily similar to the memorial candles that 
mark the main streets of another city several hundred miles north and west of 
here, a city that also recently shook off a Communist dictatorship -- Prague. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond the surface comparison, there are far more differences than 
similarities between the candles of Bucharest and those of Prague, just as 
there are more differences than similarities between the two cities and between 
the Czechoslovak and Romanian revolutions. 
</P>
<P>
Prague's candles are large, long-burning and multicolored, tended constantly by 
the cheerful and dignified crowds that nightly fill the city streets. 
</P>
<P>
Bucharest's candles are small, thin and yellow, a longer version of the sort of 
candle one would place on a child's birthday cake. They burn quickly, and along 
the deserted thoroughfares of this city, few people stop to replace them when 
they expire. 
</P>
<P>
Prague's candles are accompanied by bouquets of multicolored flowers. In 
Bucharest, where flowers in winter are rare, the memorials are surrounded by 
bread and fruit -- an Eastern Orthodox ritual offering of memoriam. 
</P>
<P>
But the most obvious difference is also the most profound: Prague's candles 
mark spots where anti-government demonstrators were beaten. In Bucharest, the 
candles burn for the dead. 
</P>
<P>
In Prague this past month, residents lined up in stores selling Christmas 
presents. In Bucharest, residents routinely line up for essential food. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, that problem would have been severely worsened by the warfare of 
the last four days. In almost any civil disturbance, particularly one as 
massive as the fighting here, the food distribution system is the first 
casualty. 
</P>
<P>
It is, therefore, an astonishing measure of how badly Nicolae Ceausescu 
squeezed his country that over the past four days of fighting, food supplies in 
the city actually have improved. 
</P>
<P>
"There is more food out in shops and stores than I've seen in a year and a 
half," said a Western diplomat, explaining that Ceausescu had withheld huge 
amounts of food from the domestic market to boost exports and earn hard 
currency to finance his massive construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, with Ceausescu gone, grocers could be seen selling bottles of milk 
and cartons of eggs from makeshift distribution points along major streets. 
Both items in the past were scarce and sometimes unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years of Ceausescu's rule, Romanians developed a saying -- "searching 
for oranges" -- the rough equivalent of the American expression "wild goose 
chase." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, oranges once again were for sale in Bucharest stores. 
</P>
<P>
But, while food supplies here are improving, many other commodities -- from 
antibiotics to gasoline -- remain in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
The gasoline shortages contribute heavily to the emptiness of Bucharest after 
darkness falls, about 4:30 on winter afternoons. And that emptiness, in turn, 
reinforces the somberness of the city's mood. 
</P>
<P>
In other East European capitals, the last months have been a time of joy, 
allayed only slightly by concern about the future. Here, by contrast, the mood 
has been tense. The celebration over the fall of Ceausescu's dictatorship has 
been heavily dampened by the price in lives that Romanians have paid for their 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
This is a city with virtually no street lights or night life. Only a few major 
boulevards are lighted, and at night, the city takes on the look of a town 
prepared for an air-raid blackout. People have few reasons to be out after 
dark, even without the continued threat from snipers and the frequently 
broadcast government warnings that civilians should remain indoors. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast with the crowded traffic of other European capitals, there are few 
cars on Bucharest streets. The price of an automobile is far beyond the means 
of most Romanians. Also, gasoline has been strictly rationed here for years, 
and in the last few days, the new authorities have appealed to residents to 
restrict driving further to avoid fuel shortages. 
</P>
<P>
With few lights and almost no cars on the street, and with shooting now largely 
over, the quiet darkness makes Bucharest seem like a country town, belying the 
statistics that show it to be a city of 2 million people. 
</P>
<P>
But the many hours of winter darkness seem appropriate for the mood of 
Romanians who have only now begun to emerge from a long spiritual night. People 
here have broken some of the bonds of fear that long held them captive, but 
many of the habits ingrained by decades of totalitarian rule remain intact. 
</P>
<P>
Some Romanians are happy now to greet foreigners, with whom they were largely 
forbidden to talk under the Ceausescu regime. But many eye all strangers 
warily, stopping on the sidewalk briefly to stare -- but hastening quickly away 
before a conversation can begin. 
</P>
<P>
"There's such a level of paranoia and distrust that people have built up with 
each other, it will be very difficult to overcome," a Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Even those Romanians who have gone the furthest -- inviting foreigners to their 
homes, for example -- are slow to abandon habits of wariness. 
</P>
<P>
On one such recent visit, the hosts asked their visitors not to speak English 
in the halls of their apartment building and quickly closed the windows and 
drew the drapes when the foreigners arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Romanians working as translators for American reporters often are reluctant to 
enter the hotels where foreigners stay, explaining, when pressed, that the 
hotels in the past have employed many informers for the secret police. 
</P>
<P>
And, while many aspects of Ceausescu's dictatorship disappeared with him, other 
parts of the repressive machinery remain. The government agency that controls 
passports has told Western diplomats it has received no instructions to change 
its policies. Until new instructions arrive, most Romanians still will be 
forbidden to travel abroad.

ENGINEER'S SUIT CLAIMS HUGHES HID CHIP DEFECT 
</P>

<P>
A former senior staff engineer at Hughes Aircraft's division in Fullerton has 
filed a multibillion-dollar lawsuit against the company, alleging that it 
covered up flaws in more than 4 million microchips installed in defense systems 
since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed by former Irvine resident Michael C. Denlinger, claims that the 
company's actions jeopardize the nation's defense system. The suit said the 
allegedly flawed chips are used in a variety of defense systems and asserted 
that two failures in submarine-launched Advanced Capability (AD-CAP) torpedoes 
resulted because of the chips. 
</P>
<P>
The microchips "are literally time bombs ready to go off at any minute," said 
Denlinger's attorney, Frank P. Barbaro. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes officials denied the allegations in the suit, which was filed in June in 
U.S. District Court in Santa Ana and unsealed Tuesday by federal Judge 
Alicemarie H. Stotler. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the stuff is just fantasy," said Dan Reeder, a spokesman for Hughes' 
Ground Systems Group in Fullerton. "We have never had any failure of the test 
torpedoes due to hardware problems during any of the hundreds of runs we have 
gone through." 
</P>
<P>
Reeder said Hughes has found two defective chips in U.S. Navy torpedoes during 
routine screening procedures but said he was unaware of any system failures. He 
said the Navy has yet to install any AD-CAP torpedoes on board any of its 
submarines. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also said the potentially defective chips were used in the electronics 
system aboard the USS Vincennes, which shot down an Iranian commercial jet in 
1988. The ship's radar, however, worked properly in that action showing the 
aircraft to be a "non-threat." 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was filed under the federal False Claims Act, a 1986 law that 
divides any spoils won in court between the complainant and the U.S. 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The suit seeks $9.6 billion in damages. Damages in false claims suits are 
generally treble the value of the products sold. Denlinger's attorneys claim 
that Hughes sold $3.2 billion in defense systems containing the microchips. 
</P>
<P>
But legal experts cautioned Tuesday against placing too much importance on the 
size of the damages sought. 
</P>
<P>
"It is so speculative at this early stage to put a dollar amount on a claim 
such as this that it makes it almost meaningless," said John Phillips, a Los 
Angeles attorney specializing in defense fraud cases. 
</P>
<P>
False claims suits require the Department of Justice to decide whether it will 
join such actions. Such suits are typically sealed while the department 
investigates the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Justice Department is still deciding what action -- if any -- to 
take in this case, it told the court that it had completed its research. 
Federal officials are expected to come to some conclusion in the next 60 days, 
according to papers filed by the government. 
</P>
<P>
Some 200 individuals have filed false claims suits against defense contractors 
since the law was enacted. Of those, the Justice Department has chosen to take 
part in 29 cases and refused to participate in 73 others. The rest are still 
under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Denlinger, a metallurgist, said in the suit that he made repeated warnings of 
alleged defects in the microchips to Hughes officials but that the warnings 
were mostly ignored. He claims that Hughes took a shortcut in soldering 
practices, causing cracks in the chips that are supposed to be airtight to 
prevent corrosion. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes officials said each chip has been inspected since they became aware in 
1985 of a cracking problem, which they described Tuesday as "an industrywide 
problem." The company said it has followed government procedures in soldering 
the chips. 
</P>
<P>
Denlinger, 49, has been in hiding since the summer because of what he said were 
repeated threats on his life, Barbaro said. The attorney said it was unknown 
who made the threats, but his client was taking them seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Denlinger had worked for Hughes for a total of 14 years. His most recent 
position was a senior staff engineer, responsible for testing material 
strengths. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' Fullerton division employs 10,000 people and makes 20 different defense 
electronics products, including radar systems. Hughes is the largest private 
employer in Orange County with more than 13,000 employees at five facilities. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the first suit filed against Hughes that alleges wrongdoing 
involving federal defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
William J. Schumer, former Hughes division contracts manager for the B-2 bomber 
at the company's Radar Systems Group in El Segundo, filed a lawsuit in 
September alleging that the firm illegally overcharged the government by $50 
million on four radar programs, including the system for the B-2 Stealth 
bomber. The suit seeks $150 million in treble damages. 
</P>
<P>
Schumer also filed another civil suit against the firm earlier this year 
alleging that Hughes incorrectly allocated charges between the F-18 and B-2 
programs. He seeks $40 million in damages, which would increase to $120 million 
with treble damages.

GOING TO GODOT: Samuel Beckett's best-known work, "Waiting for Godot," begins 
previews at the Alternative Repertory Theatre in Santa Ana Jan. 12. . . . 
Patricia Terry, artistic director, said she chose the work in part because 
Beckett (A1) "is studied at every university, because he was so innovative."

DONALD &amp; ME: The award-winning documentary "Roger &amp; Me," coming to 
Orange County on Jan. 12, chronicles film maker Michael Moore's persistent but 
unsuccessful efforts to interview General Motors Chairman Roger Smith. . . . In 
Orange County, the Irvine Co.'s powerful but publicity-shy chairman, Donald L. 
Bren (above), got about 15 requests for interviews last year, most of which 
were turned down. . . . When confronted by "creative people with their own 
agenda," said Irvine Co. spokesman Larry Thomas, the question is: "Can you 
respond to them in such a way that you don't end up with a movie made about 
it?" Dana Parsons and Mark I. Pinsky

ROMANIA-BOUND: The Panama intervention hasn't boosted local military 
recruiting, said an Army spokesman in Santa Ana, but some Orange County youths 
said they'd go overseas to fight if needed. . . . At least eight young 
Romanian-Americans put their names on a Southern California list of those 
willing to fight in Bucharest. . . . Local residents phoned relatives in 
Romania, said Pastor Daniel Branzai of the Romanian Baptist Church in Anaheim, 
who "told them about the tremendous need that they had for guns and manpower. 
That's why they were ready to go." Dana Parsons and Mark I. Pinsky

RESIDENTS OF GRID 186 FIGHT BACK; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: SANTA ANA NEIGHBORS ARE HELPING POLICE IN AN EFFORT TO CLEAN UP THEIR 
AREA.

<P>
Needle tracks cover her arms and the skin between her fingers as Denise 
clutches a $10 bill and shivers in the alley behind Minnie Street. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is nearly 40 degrees on a Friday night, Denise waits. Already, her 
high from the last injection two hours ago has begun to ebb. 
</P>
<P>
Denise is 21, a prostitute, and five months pregnant. But tonight she will buy 
a bag of heroin the size of a pinkie nail from any one of the dealers on the 
Minnie Street corridor. 
</P>
<P>
"I like my highs too much to let it go," said Denise, who frequents Minnie 
Street every day to appease her $100-a-day habit. "It makes me feel good, like 
I'm drifting and floating away." 
</P>
<P>
Denise is one of the hundreds of street regulars on the Minnie Street corridor 
of Grid 186, so named in the police system of locating areas in the city. It is 
one of Santa Ana's most crime-plagued neighborhoods, with 3,702 calls to police 
in the first 10 months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
But it is also a neighborhood that is trying to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fear of retaliation, residents and neighborhood organizations are 
trying hard to work with police to combat the daily hustling of drug dealers, 
addicts, gang members and car thieves entrenched in the area that is Grid 186. 
</P>
<P>
"The traditional way of arresting people and cutting down on crime doesn't work 
here," said Santa Ana Police Lt. George Saadeh, who is the commander of the 
district. "Arrests aren't the answer any more. We need the residents to work 
with us." 
</P>
<P>
Grid 186, known to residents as the East Side, is densely populated in its 
north end by a string of apartment houses. But at its southern end are 
manicured lawns and single-family houses. 
</P>
<P>
"Through the years, I've watched fences and bars on the windows go up. I've 
seen graffiti being marked up on the trees," said Rita Corpin, 48, who has 
lived on Myrtle Street for 39 years. "You don't walk alone in the East Side at 
night. It's not safe to walk alone." 
</P>
<P>
Addicts and gang members quicken their pace and slide into alleys at night when 
a police car cruises by. A slow whistle breaks the silence. 
</P>
<P>
"They whistle to warn others that we're around," said Officer Jeff Launi. 
"Sometimes, that's all we hear when we hit the streets. The same old whistle." 
</P>
<P>
On East Walnut Street, a known drug dealer calls out "pollo" (chicken) and 
ducks into an alley. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the nicest things people have called me here," Launi's partner, 
Mark Nichols, said. 
</P>
<P>
About 70% of the crimes in Grid 186 occur on Minnie Street or in the northern 
section, where apartment complexes each have 40 units or more. Although the 
buildings are less than 5 years old, they were constructed when the city 
density laws were less restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
With that many people in that small a space, Saadeh said, crime is inevitable. 
In November alone, 317 police incidents were reported in the grid, including 32 
car thefts, 18 warrant arrests and 15 narcotics crimes. Most of the incidents 
were reported from the northern section and from the Minnie Street corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Selling drugs has turned into a means of survival for some of those who have 
settled in the area, said Mary Ann Salamida, director of the Neighborhood 
Service Center, which provides social programs for area residents. 
</P>
<P>
"People need money. They need a fast buck. I don't think they are aware of its 
repercussions. They are not looking ahead," Salamida said. 
</P>
<P>
Denise is well known by the police who patrol the neighborhood. She knows some 
of the police officers by their first names, and they know her. 
</P>
<P>
She is not afraid of walking alone anywhere in the East Side. When she needs 
her fix, she leaves her 3-year-old twins with her mother and heads for the 
railroad tracks. She likes to walk along the tracks until she reaches the 
southern section of Minnie Street, which is nicknamed Big Minnie. There, she 
buys her heroin and then "slams," injecting herself with borrowed needles. 
</P>
<P>
For her job, she carries condoms in her denim jacket. She has been working as a 
prostitute for four years. On a good day, she can make $200 easily. On a bad 
day, she makes sure she has enough to buy her drug. 
</P>
<P>
During her last month of pregnancy, she plans to travel to Mexico to see her 
father and go cold turkey. A week ago, she had her an ultrasound test to make 
sure the baby was all right, so far. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks healthy. I don't think anything is wrong with it, everything is in 
the right place. I don't know about its brain though," Denise said. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, this is hard for me. I'm strung out. I know something can turn out wrong 
with it. But I can't stop now; maybe later." 
</P>
<P>
Like many others in Grid 186, Denise has been in and out of the Orange County 
Jail, which is too crowded to keep them for long. 
</P>
<P>
"The jail situation ties up our hands," Saadeh said. "If we arrest people for 
marijuana, cocaine or heroin, they won't stay in jail. They get out the same 
day. We could arrest people 24 hours a day; it still wouldn't help the 
neighborhood," Saadeh said. 
</P>
<P>
So police are turning to other methods to try to rid the neighborhood of crime. 
In apartment buildings, officers work with managers to evict tenants who sell 
drugs. They also have been cracking down on bars with histories of repeated 
violent incidents, citing them when they have more customers than the legal 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
And in the south end of the neighborhood, Saadeh attends the monthly meetings 
of the East Side Assn., a group of about 100 residents who meet monthly to 
tackle the crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an excellent rapport with the Police Department," said Corpin, 
chairperson of the association and a teacher at La Quinta High School in 
Westminster. "If we didn't, we would have bailed out of here long ago." 
</P>
<P>
Corpin has stuck it out even though she has been a victim. Two years ago, 
Corpin and a neighbor called police after another neighbor refused to turn down 
music during a New Year's Eve party by a neighborhood gang. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, gum turpentine was poured on her car and her tires were 
slashed. 
</P>
<P>
But what makes her more angry are people who fear that kind of retaliation and 
don't report crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"For those who don't call the police, it makes the effort harder for those who 
do," Corpin said. "Retaliation is very intimidating. There is strength in 
unity. We could retain some control of our lives or else it would be 
intolerable." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents fight back by jotting down car license numbers of people openly 
dealing drugs on the street, and noting which apartments they visit. Some call 
to report new gang graffiti on walls, or the appearance of abandoned cars. 
</P>
<P>
The East Side Assn. has distributed a flyer with tips on how to call for 
graffiti removal and how to keep the neighborhood clean. In 1986, the 
association persuaded the city to reduce the allowable apartment density from 
90 units per acre to 22. 
</P>
<P>
The association is also trying to recruit more residents from the northern 
section, which has no such group. One reason is the distrust of the police 
officers in the north and the Minnie Street corridor. 
</P>
<P>
To help combat that distrust, police officers are invited to make regular 
visits to the Neighborhood Service Center's classes in English as a Second 
Language, where they tell students, many newly arrived Latinos and Cambodians, 
how to report crime. 
</P>
<P>
Police also must try to combat residents' fear of retaliation, which Saadeh 
said is extremely rare. 
</P>
<P>
Maria R. has lived on Standard Street for about two years and is afraid of the 
dealers and addicts who come right up to her yard. But she worries that they 
would hurt her children if she said anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want my sons to see the drugs. I don't want them growing up near the 
drugs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The residents don't know that the police and neighborhood organizations can 
help them, Saadeh said. 
</P>
<P>
"They often feel hopelessness, Saadeh said. "But people are more aware now. 
Things can't change overnight. But they don't have to feel all alone."

CITY'S PAST COMES ALIVE AT MUSEUM

When Evelyn Ojeda posed with her Tustin Union High School basketball team 58 
years ago, she never dreamed that one day the photograph would hang in a 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
The 1931 photograph is on display at the Tustin Area Historical Museum, where 
Ojeda works as a volunteer. The school, incidentally, was demolished more than 
20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The museum features not only early photos, but also artifacts and other items 
that allow visitors to glimpse early life in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
On display are tools and furniture from the city's early agricultural days, 
fossils, a Spanish saddle and branding iron from the county's rancho period, 
and Indian artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
A 100-year-old time clock used at a local fruit company still rings when 
punched. A peanut-roasting machine that once stood in a pool hall is now used 
as a donation box for the museum, where admission is free but gifts are 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Some days are busier than others. During the city's annual chili cook-off last 
year, 350 visitors toured the 1,627-square-foot museum, Ojeda said. Other days 
only a few people show up. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Fruehe and Robert Guevara wandered through the museum recently after 
driving by it many times on their lunch break from a Santa Ana company. 
</P>
<P>
"We love looking at the old houses in the area and were curious to see the old 
photos and stuff," said Fruehe, an artist from Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty interesting," Guevara said. "They should really advertise it so 
people know about it." 
</P>
<P>
The museum was founded in 1976 as an outgrowth of the U.S. Bicentennial 
celebration, said Carol Jordan, one of the founders. Originally housed in the 
city's old police building, it moved in 1979 to its present home in the Knights 
of Pythias building, at El Camino Real and Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
One of the museum's featured items is the city's first fire truck, a converted 
1912 Buick with wooden-spoked wheels and a hand-cranked siren. Sam Tustin, the 
son of city founder Columbus Tustin, donated the Buick to the Chamber of 
Commerce. It was used by the city's volunteers to battle blazes from about 1922 
to 1936, and later was used in parades. 
</P>
<P>
Even older firefighting equipment is on display. A chemical tank on wooden 
wheels was pushed to fires by firemen or towed by a car. When the tank was 
inverted, chemicals spilled into the water and a reaction created the pressure 
needed to force the water through a hose. 
</P>
<P>
Pictures show the city's early residents and their homes. When incorporated in 
1927, the town had 900 residents. 
</P>
<P>
A photo of Tustin in the 1950s depicts a square mile of houses and shops 
surrounded by orange groves. 
</P>
<P>
The museum, which is supported by book sales, rental assistance from the city 
and dues from Tustin Area Historical Society members as well as donations, is 
open from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays and 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. the 
first Saturday of each month. Group tours are given by appointment. SHANNON

PETITIONS OFFERED FOR YALE AVENUE BRIDGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County officials this week were examing petitions bearing the signatures of 
more than 7,000 residents who are urging the construction of two vehicular 
bridges on Yale Avenue, a controversial proposal for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether the two missing links will be provided to make Yale a 
continuous north-south thoroughfare in Irvine, relieving traffic pressure on 
Culver Drive and Jeffrey Road. 
</P>
<P>
The petitions were filed by Yale Action, a group headed by Lowell Johnson, 
former Irvine transportation and planning commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
The group seeks to force City Council approval, or a public vote on the plan, 
to build the two bridges. One would be constructed over the Atchison, Topeka 
&amp; Santa Fe Railroad tracks and connect the six El Camino Real neighborhoods 
with Woodbridge. The other would cross the San Diego Freeway and link 
Woodbridge to University Park. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller versions of both bridges, limited to pedestrians, bicycles and 
emergency vehicles, are in place. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said his group would like to see a scaled-back version of the bridges, 
included in the city's first general plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The city's original plan called for four lanes on each bridge, two in each 
direction," said Johnson, who lives in the Ranch neighborhood. "We are asking 
for two lanes, one in each direction." 
</P>
<P>
Those two vehicular lanes on each bridge would flare out to four lanes, two in 
each direction, at each end of the overpass, according to the Yale Action 
petition. Johnson and other proponents of the plan claim that the bridges would 
give motorists an option for north-south traffic and would ease pressure on 
Jeffrey Road and Culver Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the plan, who have included Mayor Larry Agran and Councilman 
Edward A. Dornan, believe that a continuous Yale Avenue would mean more traffic 
and pollution in nearby neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The bridge proposal has divided city constituencies for 12 years, according to 
City Manager Paul Brady Jr. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a public hearing on the proposed bridges had to be moved to larger 
quarters when about 700 residents appeared, Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The city is studying the environmental impacts of expanded bridges, the third 
such study in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
If the petition is ruled valid, the proposal will be submitted to the City 
Council, which could either adopt the plan or call for a special election. 
Lacey predicted that the issue would be placed on the Jan. 23 council agenda.

ENCEPHALITIS VICTIM IS RELEARNING IT ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was a time when Debra Kezer would stay up all night reading romance 
novels, unable to tear herself away until the last page. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the Westminster resident must limit her reading to books by Dr. 
Seuss and other children's authors. At 30, she is learning to read all over 
again. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Kezer was bitten by a mosquito and contracted encephalitis, which left 
her in a coma for 10 days. The illness caused her brain to swell, and she 
suffered stroke-like damage that left her unable to care for herself. 
</P>
<P>
Kezer was one of four Orange County residents to be infected by the 
mosquito-carried virus. Its effects can be similar to an attack of the flu, and 
some cases go unreported because of the flu-like symptoms. In more serious 
cases, there is a possibility of permanent brain damage or death. 
</P>
<P>
"I got sick, but I thought it was a cold or the flu," Kezer said. "Next thing I 
knew, it was a month later and I was in the hospital. I didn't recognize my 
husband or my son. I was like a baby. They had to teach me how to eat, walk and 
go to the bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
After months of therapy, Kezer regained her physical abilities but was still 
unable to speak or read. For an avid reader and self-described nonstop talker, 
it was quite a blow. 
</P>
<P>
During the first year of her recovery, Kezer also suffered through a divorce 
from her husband, Donald, but the two remain friends, and she kept custody of 
their son, Donny. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Kezer said, she was determined to return to normal, something 
that didn't surprise her mother, Beverly Gulley. 
</P>
<P>
"She has such a fighting spirit and always has. That's what has gotten her 
through all of this," Gulley said. Through speech therapy at Cal State Long 
Beach, Kezer has learned to talk almost as well as she did before her illness. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God, I can still talk a lot. If I didn't have such a strong desire to 
talk, I don't know if I would have come this far," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Learning to read again has come more slowly. For the past two years, she has 
been tutored through the Adult Literacy Program at Huntington Beach Central 
Library by 71-year-old Jean Smith, a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
"When Debra came to us, she couldn't read anything but the letters in the 
alphabet. Right now, she's reading at about a third-grade level. I have never 
seen a young person so determined. She was so determined to learn how to read 
before her little boy did," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Kezer and her son, Donny, 7, are learning how to read 
together. They often spend the afternoon on the couch in their Westminster 
apartment, reading books donated by Donny's school. 
</P>
<P>
"When we sit down to read together, a lot of times there will be a word that I 
can't say, and Donny will say it for me. He'll just laugh and say, 'Say it this 
way, Mom.' Between the two of us, we get through the books," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Kezer said her experience has changed her outlook on life. 
</P>
<P>
"When it first happened, all I could think about was 'why me?' But when I went 
into therapy, I met a lot of people who were a lot worse off. People who didn't 
have legs and arms. I just thank God I have what I have and have the chance to 
get where I once was," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Kezer said she is thinking about becoming a nurse and helping stroke victims 
and others who have to experience what she went through. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to tell them that if I got through it, they can, too," she said.

COUNCIL VOTES MORE LOWER-COST HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned about the availability of low-cost housing in this affluent beach 
town, the City Council has increased the proportion of low-cost homes 
developers must provide as part of new projects. 
</P>
<P>
The city's housing plan now requires that 20% the of all developments larger 
than five units be set aside for low-cost housing and that the housing remain 
in the possession of low-income families for 20 years. The previous standard 
required 15% of new projects to be low-cost units and remain so for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Developers have the option of paying a fee to the city in lieu of building 
low-cost homes. The fee would go into a fund for building low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the plan, the council also created a committee to monitor 
developers' compliance with the housing requirements. The committee, called the 
Housing Authority, will also oversee the resale of low-cost homes to make sure 
they remain in the hands of low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
The council has not yet determined the size of the committee or who will serve 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires that every city have provisions for low-cost housing and 
that the standards be revised every five years.WENDY PAULSON

CELEBRATING BLACK UNITY AND CULTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With Christmas over and New Year's Day approaching, some Orange County 
residents for the first time Tuesday observed Kwanzaa -- for 24 years a 
celebration of black culture and unity. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to believe in each other. We have to trust in each other," said 
Charles W. Thomas, a leader of the black community in San Diego, as he opened 
the ceremony and invited celebrants to express their trust and belief in each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
The group of about 25 people gathered at the Corbin Center in Santa Ana, held 
hands and greeted their neighbors as the celebration began. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, Kwanzaa is a seven-day ceremony, beginning the day after Christmas 
and ending New Year's Day. It literally means "first fruits" in Swahili, based 
on an African agricultural calendar, and on each day of the celebration one of 
the nguzo saba (seven principles) is observed and discussed. 
</P>
<P>
The tradition was brought to the United States in the mid-'60s by Maulana 
Karenga, who translated ancient African writings from Swahili, and from them 
created a contemporary celebration of African-American heritage. 
</P>
<P>
But Roland Holmes, program director of the Orange County Urban League and 
organizer of the event in Orange County, said that because this is the county's 
first Kwanzaa, only the opening night would be celebrated as an introduction. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas told the men, women and a few children in the meeting room about the 
seven principles of Kwanzaa. 
</P>
<P>
The principles -- umoja (unity), kujichagulia (self-determination), ujima 
(collective work and responsibility), ujamaa (cooperative economics), nia 
(purpose), kuumba (creativity) and imani (faith) -- encourage each celebrant to 
better his community by improving his own life. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas then took the first principle -- unity -- and asked what it meant to the 
participants and how they would commit themselves to pursuing it during the 
coming year. 
</P>
<P>
As the participants discussed the principle, they considered possible changes 
they could make in their daily habits, such as becoming more informed about 
black history and participating more in black community events. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes asked the youngest boy and girl, both children of an Anaheim couple, to 
take the sole lit candle on the kinara -- a candelabrum with one candle 
representing each of the seven principles -- and light the next one. 
</P>
<P>
The children's parents said they brought them to Kwanzaa because they wanted 
them to learn about their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to learn about other black celebrations," said Jerold Hall, who 
came with his wife, Earlene, and children, Christopher, 10, and Jennifer, 5. 
"We finally realized we're not by ourselves; we (blacks in Orange County) are 
just spread out." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the ceremony, members of the group drank from a variation of the 
karamu, a unity cup, as Holmes asked them to reflect on the first theme of 
Kwanzaa. 
</P>
<P>
"I want you to close your eyes and visualize the commitment each of us has made 
publicly here tonight," he said. "We have made the commitment to make the world 
a better place." LISA MASCARO

MAILER FROM RECALL PANEL FOUND LEGAL; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: THE MAILER WAS PART OF A CAMPAIGN THAT HAS FORCED A MISSION VIEJO 
CITY COUNCILMAN TO FACE A RECALL VOTE FEB. 27.

<P>
The recall committee trying to oust City Councilman Robert A. Curtis did not 
break any laws by sending a mailer that opponents attacked as deceptive, a 
prosecutor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Citing insufficient evidence to prosecute, Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace Wade said 
the Coalition To Recall Councilman Curtis did not break any laws last summer by 
mailing campaign material to voters in envelopes stamped "Official City 
Documents Enclosed." 
</P>
<P>
Wade said the mailer could be seen as misleading, but added: "Whether the 
intent was good or evil, it doesn't matter because it wasn't illegal. . . . 
There are no criminal penalties for what was on the outside of that envelope." 
</P>
<P>
The mailer was part of a successful petition drive that has forced Curtis to 
face a recall election Feb. 27. Recall proponents accuse the councilman of 
attempting a power grab in his efforts to annex Aegean Hills, a 583-acre 
section of land bordering Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Sunnie Castner, the resident who filed the complaint in September, said she was 
"obviously disappointed" with the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"This goes to show that anybody can send anything out with 'official city 
business' on it and get away with it," she said. "If they can misrepresent that 
to the entire public at large, what else can they be misrepresenting?" 
</P>
<P>
Curtis called the decision "unfortunate. It's too bad that a legal technicality 
relieves the coalition of responsibility to be honest and straightforward with 
the electorate." 
</P>
<P>
"Although the district attorney's office cannot find any codes to prosecute, I 
think Mission Viejo voters will pass judgment on Feb. 27," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Coalition leader Helen Monroe said the envelope contained a copy of the recall 
petition that had been approved by City Clerk Ivy Sobel, making the mailer "a 
city-OKd document." 
</P>
<P>
In September the City Council took steps to disassociate itself from the 
mailer, although members declined to censure the coalition by a 3-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
"But the point," Monroe stressed, "is that if there is no law against (the 
mailer), it is legal. That is what our attorneys told us before we sent it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Castner called the mailer "a flagrant abuse" of campaign ethics. "I'm surprised 
nobody has done something about it already," Castner said. 
</P>
<P>
Wade said previous attempts to pass legislation to ban such tactics "have run 
afoul of the courts because of free-speech problems." 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you restrict a person's right to speak, you have a potential 
violation of free-speech rights," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wade said the phrase "official city documents" is a vague term. "It can mean 
all kinds of things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision leaves two separate complaints pending against the coalition. One 
complaint, filed by the Mission Viejo city clerk's office, alleges that the 
coalition used petition circulators who weren't city residents. And earlier 
this month, the state Fair Political Practices Commission was asked by Curtis 
to investigate whether the Mission Viejo Co. is largely behind the recall 
movement and should be forced to list itself as a co-sponsor of the coalition.

COUNTY BLOSSOMS DURING ITS DECADE OF DOMINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Given the population explosion, it was inevitable that Orange County would 
become a hotbed for high school athletics. More people meant more students and 
thus, more athletes. 
</P>
<P>
But get real. Huddled masses or not, this place has gone crazy when it comes to 
prep sports. 
</P>
<P>
During the last 10 years, Orange County has become the bloom and, sometimes, 
the thorn of the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Championships? The trophy cases have been overflowing. 
</P>
<P>
County teams have won 221 of 725 section titles during the decade. And that's 
not counting 15 state championships. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dynasties? Mater Dei has won more boys' basketball championships in the 
'80s (five) than were won by all county teams in the '70s (four). The 
Brea-Olinda girls' basketball program rivals any in the state, possibly the 
country. And then there's Mission Viejo for boys' swimming or girls' soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Controversy? The '80s began with innuendo and ended in court. Rumors of 
recruiting by some coaches brought finger pointing from others. 
</P>
<P>
A Capistrano Valley football coach was suspended two years for allegedly spying 
on a rival school. And litigation almost became an athletic event last season, 
when the Huntington Beach and Savanna football teams attempted to enter the 
playoffs through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
When the decade began, Todd Marinovich was in grade school, and next week he'll 
be leading USC in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, 10 years. Where did they go? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BY THE NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
Orange County teams, which made up about 10% of the Southern Section, won 31% 
of the section's titles during the decade. 
</P>
<P>
That dominance was rooted in the late '70s, when county football teams 
established themselves as forces. In the two years preceding 1980, county 
schools won seven football titles and five other teams advanced to championship 
games. 
</P>
<P>
County football teams have remained among the best in the section, winning 26 
section championships in the '80s. But the other sports began to show their 
strength too. 
</P>
<P>
County girls' teams won 84 section championships and eight state titles. 
</P>
<P>
The girls' programs always have been strong in cross-country, volleyball, 
swimming and tennis. But they also have become dominant in basketball, soccer 
and softball. 
</P>
<P>
County teams won 12 section titles in softball, 11 in basketball and six in 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
In boys' athletics, basketball and soccer have made the greatest strides. 
County teams won 12 section basketball championships and two state titles. 
Soccer teams, which didn't win a section title in the '70s, won 13 in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BEST OF THE REST 
</P>
<P>
With so much winning going on it was natural that dynasties would emerge, and 
the Mater Dei boys' basketball team was the most publicized of the '80s 
powerhouses. 
</P>
<P>
When Gary McKnight was hired as coach in 1983, the Monarchs had won or shared 
only three Angelus titles in 13 years. In McKnight's seven years, Mater Dei has 
not only won six league championships but also five Southern Section titles and 
a state championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs' first championship was the county's first large schools' title in 
46 years. A crowd of 12,506 saw Mater Dei defeat Long Beach Poly, 62-44, in the 
4-A final at the L.A. Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Monarch players went on to play in college, including Tom Lewis 
(USC, Pepperdine), LeRon Ellis (Kentucky, Syracuse) and Matt Beeuwsaert (Notre 
Dame, California). 
</P>
<P>
The only time the Monarchs failed to win an Angelus League title under McKnight 
was in 1987-88. Mater Dei finished second to Bishop Amat, which beat the 
Monarchs twice. However, Mater Dei defeated Bishop Amat, 74-65, in the 5-A 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs also were a national power, playing some of country's top teams. 
In 1983, Mater Dei was USA Today's No. 1-ranked team and traveled to Washington 
D.C. to play No. 2 DeMatha. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs lost, 66-51. 
</P>
<P>
In girls' basketball, Brea-Olinda established itself as the top program. Under 
Coach Mark Trakh, the Wildcats won two section titles and finished second three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
They also became the first girls' basketball team in the county to win a state 
title when they defeated San Francisco Mercy, 70-46, last season. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Brea-Olinda defeated Morningside, the nation's No. 1-ranked girls' 
team, in the semifinals of the Tournament of Champions. The Wildcats then beat 
Los Angeles Washington, the defending Los Angeles Section champions, in the 
title game. 
</P>
<P>
For national prominence, though, there was Mission Viejo's girls' soccer team. 
The Diablos set a national unbeaten string of 84 consecutive games between 
1986-89 before losing to El Toro, 2-1, last January. 
</P>
<P>
During the streak, Mission Viejo won two section titles and was co-champion 
another year. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Diablos' record didn't survive the decade. Agoura broke it two 
weeks ago after a 1-1 tie against Westlake. It was the Chargers' 85th game 
without a defeat. 
</P>
<P>
But no school dominated a sport like Mission Viejo's swim team. 
</P>
<P>
Until last season, the Diablos had won 14 consecutive 4-A championships. 
Mission Viejo scored more than 200 points in the championship meet 10 times and 
twice topped the 300-point total. 
</P>
<P>
Only one other school has surpassed the 200-point total. In 1985, Mission Viejo 
set a Southern Section record by scoring 323 points to win the title. 
Capistrano Valley was second with 99 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Diablos' reign came to an end last season, when Foothill won the 4-A 
championship. The Diablos slipped all the way to second place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BEST OF THE WORST 
</P>
<P>
"Undue influence" became the catch phrase of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Before the decade began, rumors about alleged recruiting by coaches were being 
circulated. Bill Workman, then Edison football coach, was one of the first 
accused. 
</P>
<P>
Edison had won Big Five championships in 1979 and '80. The Chargers also were 
the No. 1-ranked team in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Allegations of illegal recruiting and grade changing led the Huntington Beach 
Unified School District to examine Edison's program and coach. After a 
six-month investigation, Workman was vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
Others were not, however. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ocean View basketball Coach Jim Harris was fired and then rehired in 1985. 
The Seahawks had to forfeit 24 games and their Sunset League title after the 
district determined that Harris had used undue influence to recruit Ricky 
Bulter and Desi Hazely. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Capistrano Valley football Coach Dick Enright was suspended two seasons and 
the Cougars had to forfeit a 22-21 victory over El Toro in 1987. Enright, the 
Cougars' coach for seven seasons, admitted viewing a videotape of an El Toro 
practice before the teams played. He quit coaching three days after the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mater Dei's basketball team was put on probation in 1988 by the Southern 
Section executive committee after it ruled that the school's administrators 
used undue influence in recruiting three athletes. As a result of the decision, 
John Merino was stripped of his duties overseeing interscholastic athletics. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the decade, the phrase "taking the court" had an entirely new 
meaning. 
</P>
<P>
The football teams from Huntington Beach and Savanna were forced to forfeit 
league championships and playoff berths because of ineligible players. Booster 
clubs from both schools went to court to get their teams reinstated. Huntington 
Beach was, temporarily. In the end, both teams missed the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
UPSETS, THRILLERS AND CROWD PLEASERS 
</P>
<P>
Entering the 1981 football playoffs, Edison had a 32-game winning streak. The 
Chargers were two-time defending Big Five Conference champions and the No. 
1-ranked team in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen players from that team would receive major college scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
In the first round of the playoffs, Edison was matched against Servite. The 
Friars were 6-4, but had lost three of their last four games and were a 
wild-card entry. 
</P>
<P>
This was supposed to be a no-brainer: Edison in a romp. 
</P>
<P>
Final score: Servite 14, Edison 7. 
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest upset of the decade. The Friars pulled it off with tough 
defense and a few breaks. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' standout running back, Dave Geroux, missed the second half 
because of a broken wrist and quarterback Ken Major played with a separated 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Edison had possession on the Servite 20-yard line with 30 seconds to 
play. But Major's fourth-down pass fell off John O'Callahan's fingertips in the 
end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Three months later, Edison's basketball team was the top-seeded team going into 
the 4-A playoffs. The Chargers featured 6-foot-6 forward Richard Chang, who 
would later play at Cal. 
</P>
<P>
In the first round, Edison was matched against Servite. Once again, the Friars 
pulled off the upset with a 58-54 victory. The Chargers made only six of 25 
second-half shots. 
</P>
<P>
But nothing compares to the Foothill-El Modena football games in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
During the regular season, Foothill hung on for a 21-17 victory after an 
apparent El Modena touchdown was disallowed. 
</P>
<P>
On a fourth down at the Foothill five with 1:57 left, El Modena's Jim Fregosi 
appeared to have caught a touchdown pass for the go-ahead score. One official 
signaled touchdown, but another said Fregosi didn't have possession. 
</P>
<P>
The touchdown was nullified and Foothill ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
The teams met a month later in the Southern Conference championship game. 
Foothill won again, 35-28, in a thriller that took 2 hours 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The game was tied, 14-14, after regulation and went into the California 
tiebreaker, where each team gets four plays from the 10-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams scored on their first two possessions. Foothill then went ahead, 
35-28, and won after James Laird intercepted a David Money pass in the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, the Southern Section changed its rules to allow for 
co-championships in title games. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of county football was apparent early in the decade. A crowd of 
28,969 at Anaheim Stadium saw Edison and Fountain Valley play for the Big Five 
Conference championship. Edison won, 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Servite and Mater Dei drew 11,000 at Santa Ana Stadium, which lists 
its capacity at 10,000. When ticket-selling was cut off, many people, including 
former UCLA assistant coach Homer Smith, climbed the fence and sat on the grass 
at the north end of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Servite, behind quarterback Steve Beuerlein, won, 42-7. Beuerlein, who went on 
to play at Notre Dame and for the Raiders, completed 22 of 33 passes for 343 
yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BEST OF THE BUNCH 
</P>
<P>
Individually, county athletes reached new heights, and distances, in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich set a national high school record for career passing yards with 
9,182 while playing for Mater Dei and Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
However, Marinovich never won a Southern Section championship. His rival, Bret 
Johnson of El Toro, won two titles. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia running back Ray Pallares set a state record for career yards with 
5,397 during his three years (1983-85). On the night that Pallares set the 
record, Valencia boosters were selling towels that read, "Run baby Ray, run."

LEWIS, EVANS AMONG BEST AND BRIGHTEST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a decade filled with stars and star-quality performances, a few stood out 
above the rest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BADMINTON 
</P>
<P>
Boys: Ferdinand Rivera (Pacifica). Rivera, a native of the Philippines, won 
three consecutive Southern Section championships from 1983-85. Rivera, who was 
5-feet-3 and 120 pounds as a senior, had a 40-1 record in his final year at 
Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
Girls: Tracy Hudson (Garden Grove). Hudson had a 154-5 record in her four-year 
career at Garden Grove. She won three consecutive Southern Section singles 
titles, and the junior national championship triple crown (singles, doubles and 
mixed doubles) in 1987. Hudson died in October 1987 in a single-car accident 
the day after playing in a tournament at Arizona State, the college for which 
she competed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL 
</P>
<P>
Bill Dodd (Capistrano Valley). Dodd, a 6-3, 200-pound right-handed pitcher, was 
twice named The Times' county player of the year (1983-84). Dodd had a 28-2 
overall record with 300 strikeouts in his three-year career. He led Capistrano 
Valley to three consecutive South Coast League titles, and in 1983 was named 
the 2-A player of the year after leading his team to the 2-A championship. As a 
senior, Dodd went 10-0 in the regular season with a 1.72 earned-run average, 
and batted .425 with a county-leading nine home runs. He played for Arizona 
State one season and then one season for Saddleback College before signing with 
the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
Boys: Tom Lewis (Mater Dei). In his senior year, Lewis averaged 32 points and 
11.7 rebounds in leading the school to the 1985 5-A championship. That year, 
Lewis received the same honor -- being named the Southern Section player of the 
year -- as two other Mater Dei players in this decade: Matt Beeuwsaert (1983, 
4-A) and LeRon Ellis (1987, 5-A). In addition to leading Mater Dei to the 1985 
5-A title, Lewis helped the Monarchs to the 1983 Southern Section title as a 
sophomore. In 1984, he led them to the 1984 title game, which they lost to Long 
Beach Poly in overtime, 45-44. "He was probably the only guy that played on a 
team that dominated like we did for three years," Coach Gary McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
Girls: Aimee McDaniel (Brea-Olinda). At 5-6, the senior point guard has become 
the best player in Brea's illustrious history. McDaniel, The Times' county 
player of the year as a sophomore in 1988 and the Division III player of the 
year in 1989, is an exceptional outside shooter, but her greatest strength 
perhaps is her tenacity. Nicknamed the Baby-faced Assassin, McDaniel has stared 
down -- and outplayed -- a number of the state's older, bigger and stronger 
players. "We had Carrie Egan (the 3-A player of the year in '87), but we 
couldn't beat anyone (on the national level) with Carrie," Brea Coach Mark 
Trakh said. "With Aimee, we've beat teams that are powers outside (Orange 
County). Aimee's the best impact player we've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CROSS-COUNTRY 
</P>
<P>
Boys: Jon Butler (Edison). Although Butler ran only one season in the 1980s 
before graduating, that one season proved more impressive than those of any 
other county runner in the next nine years. In 1980, Butler was undefeated, 
winning the 4-A title at Saddleback College in 14:56. Butler went on to become 
a two-time All-American at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Girls: Polly Plumer (University). Plumer was plagued with injuries throughout 
her career, but when she was healthy, she was nearly unbeatable. She won two 
Southern Section 4-A titles (1980-81), and ran the Mt. SAC course in 17:27, 
still the fastest time for any county girl. Although her best sport was track 
-- a three-time state champion at 1,600 meters and she still holds the national 
record in the mile at 4:35.24 -- Plumer was the most talented female prep 
distance runner in the county since Mary Slaney, who attended -- but did not 
compete for -- Orange High School. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL 
</P>
<P>
Bret Johnson (El Toro). Johnson passed for 6,627 yards in his career -- 2,458 
in his senior season -- but his best statistic perhaps is that he never lost a 
game he started in his junior and senior seasons. As a junior in 1986, Johnson 
was the county's highest-rated passer during the regular season with 20 
touchdowns and two interceptions. That year, he led El Toro to a 14-0 record 
and the Southern Conference championship, and was named The Times' quarterback 
of the year. As a senior in 1987, Johnson, now at UCLA, missed four games with 
a knee injury that required surgery, but still finished as the county's 
second-leading passer (after Capistrano Valley's Todd Marinovich). He finished 
with 1,369 yards and 15 touchdowns in leading El Toro to its second consecutive 
Southern Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GOLF 
</P>
<P>
Boys: Chris Tidland (Valencia). Tidland won the Southern Section individual 
title in 1989, becoming only the second county player to do so in the '80s 
(Matt Baugh of Huntington Beach won in 1988). Tidland was named The Times' 
golfer of the year as a junior in 1989. He won the highly competitive Orange 
League title that year with a scoring average of 73.6, and averaged 1.79 putts 
a hole. He had only three double bogeys all season. 
</P>
<P>
Girls: Kim Saiki (Ocean View). Saiki won the CIF-Southern California Golf Assn. 
regional championship twice (1983, '84) and was the runner-up in 1982. She was 
the only county girl to win the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
Michele Granger (Valencia). Granger, a three-time Southern Section player of 
the year (1986-88), has been called the best softball pitcher in the world on 
several occasions. In high school, Granger set national career records for 
strikeouts (1,635), no-hitters (36) and perfect games (nine). She set national 
single-season records for strikeouts (509) and perfect games (three), and tied 
national single-season records for no-hitters (11) and consecutive strikeouts 
in a game (21). Perhaps her most impressive statistic, however, is her 71 high 
school victories, of which 36 were no-hitters. A two-time Times' county player 
of the year, Granger, who is now attending Cal, won several championships on 
the national and international levels, but her high school team never won a 
Southern Section title. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOCCER 
</P>
<P>
Girls: Julie Foudy (Mission Viejo). A three-time Times' county player of the 
year and a three-time Southern Section player of the year, Foudy, a 5-6 
midfielder, was the key to Mission Viejo's domination from 1986-88. In that 
time, the Diablos won three Southern Section 4-A titles (the '86 title was 
shared with Edison). In addition, Foudy led Mission Viejo to 84 consecutive 
games without a loss -- a national record. Foudy, now playing at Stanford, is 
considered among the finest women players in the nation -- on any level. 
</P>
<P>
Boys: Joe-Max Moore (Mission Viejo). Last March, Moore led Mission Viejo to its 
first Southern Section title in the 3-A division. Despite being one of the 
smallest players around (5-7, 130 pounds), the midfielder was nearly 
unstoppable. Now playing for UCLA, Moore led the South Coast League in goals 
(25) and assists (10) in 1989 and was named player of the year in the league 
and the county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SWIMMING 
</P>
<P>
Boys: Darren Ward, (Sonora). Ward set Southern Section records in the 200-yard 
individual medley (1:48.83) in 1987, a national record at the time, and the 
100-yard freestyle (45.31). Both records are still current Southern Section 
bests. Ward, who now attends UCLA, won the 3-A 200 IM and 100-yard freestyle in 
1985, '86 and '87. Last year, Ward swam for the Canadian Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
Girls: Janet Evans (El Dorado). Many Olympic swimmers wouldn't even bother 
competing at the high school level, but Evans, who won three gold medals at the 
1988 Seoul Olympics, was a team player all the way. She competed in four 
Southern Section championship meets at El Dorado, where she won 10 section 
titles (including relays). Evans, now swimming at Stanford, set national high 
school records in the 200-yard IM (1:59.96) and the 500 freestyle (4:38.34). 
Even though Evans became an international swimming star, she said high school 
competition offered her some things Olympic competition never could. "I got to 
swim the 100 backstroke and the 100 breaststroke (in high school)," she said. 
"I could never do that on the international level." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
Boys: Mike Briggs (Corona del Mar). A three-time Times' county player of the 
year, Briggs was a four-time Sea View League singles champion and won the 
Southern Section individual title as a sophomore. Although he lost in the 
semifinals as a junior and senior, those were his only losses those seasons. 
Though it is not a Southern Section-sanctioned event, winning the Ojai 
tournament was probably Briggs' greatest accomplishment during high school. 
Briggs went to UC Irvine, where he played his freshman and sophomore years, but 
left school last year to play professionally. 
</P>
<P>
Girls: Keri Phebus (Corona del Mar). Last year as a freshman, Phebus became the 
first county girl to win a Southern Section individual singles title. This 
fall, she won the title again. She also has led Corona del Mar to the last two 
section team titles. "She's the best player I ever saw out of this county," her 
coach, Dave Heffern, said. Phebus, The Times' player of the year in 1988 and 
'89, has lost only two high school matches -- she was undefeated this year -- 
but is considering skipping high school competition next year to concentrate on 
national and international tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TRACK AND FIELD 
</P>
<P>
Boys: Brian Blutreich (Capistrano Valley). Blutreich set county and state 
records in both the shotput (69-feet 6 1/2-inches) and discus (210-8) in 1985. 
He won the Southern Section, Masters and state shotput titles in both 1984 and 
'85, and Southern Section, Masters and state titles in the discus in '85. In 
the 1985 Keebler Invitational, he won both the shot and discus events, becoming 
only the second athlete to win both in the meet's history. Other county 
weightmen pale in comparison to Blutreich -- none have tossed the discus more 
than 191 feet, and in the '80s, the athlete to come closest to his mark was San 
Clemente's Jim Doehring, who had a toss of 64-11 3/4 in 1980. Blutreich is 
currently competing for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Girls: Natalie Kaaiawahia (Fullerton). Kaaiawahia is the only athlete, male or 
female, to win four state titles in the same event, as she did in the shotput 
from 1980-83. She added two more state titles in the discus in 1981 and '83. 
Most impressive, though, is her national prep record in the event, 53-feet 7 
3/4-inches set in 1983, which has not been threatened. Kaaiawahia owns the 
nation's top 10 girls' throws of all time. Her 10th-best throw -- 51-8 1/2 as a 
sophomore in 1981 -- would still be a national record by 4 1/2 inches. 
Kaaiawahia also holds the county record in the discus (174-9), which is 10th on 
the national list. Kaaiawahia went to Arizona State, but after failing to make 
the 1984 U.S. Olympic team, she left school a year later, and is working as a 
reserve police officer in Grover City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
Boys: Dan Hanan (Edison). Newport Harbor's Dan Glenn has coached some of the 
county's best boys' players, but he singles out Hanan, the 1986 4-A player of 
the year, as the best. Hanan, a senior playing at Stanford, never played 
volleyball until high school, but quickly adapted to the game. A 6-4 middle 
blocker, Hanan was an All-Southern Section selection as a junior and senior, 
and was The Times' player of the year in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Girls: Bev Oden (Irvine). The third of three talented volleyball-playing 
sisters, Oden helped lead Irvine to three Southern Section finals and two 
Southern Section and state championships. In her senior season in 1988, Oden, a 
6-2 middle blocker, was named the player of the year in the South Coast League, 
Southern Section and state. At the state championship, she recorded a 
state-record 25 kills in Irvine's victory over Davis High. Oden, who started at 
Stanford this year as a freshman, also was a state finalist in the shotput. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WATER POLO 
</P>
<P>
Chris Oeding (Corona del Mar). Oeding, the 1988 Southern Section player of the 
year, was a two-time high school All-American (1986-87). He led Corona del Mar 
to two Southern Section titles. In 1987, he was selected first-team 
All-Southern Section, and in '86 was selected to the third team. Oeding, a 
second-team collegiate All-American for Stanford this season, played for the 
U.S. national youth team as a high school senior. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WRESTLING 
</P>
<P>
Steve Lawson (El Dorado). Lawson won Southern Section and state titles in 1986 
at 191 pounds, leading El Dorado to second place in the state. He had 
impressive take-down abilities; his best performance might have been in the 
state finals, when he pinned his opponent in the championship match. "Steve 
Lawson was absolutely the most dominant wrestler and probably the toughest (in 
Orange County)," Canyon Coach Gary Bowden said. Lawson wrestled for the Army 
for two years before going on to Cal State Bakersfield.

PREP ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
ESTANCIA RUNS AWAY WITH 101-52 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Estancia High School ran into a team that mirrored its style but not its 
abilities in the first round of the Coast Christmas tournament Tuesday night at 
Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
Vista ran and pressed and shot three-point field goals, which are only a few of 
the Eagles' favorite things to do. In short, Vista played right into their 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles ran wild in a 101-52 victory that provided a chance for Estancia to 
do what it likes best but rarely gets a chance to do. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see many teams that will run with us," Estancia Coach Tim O'Brien 
said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons they don't is because the Eagles run and gun well. It's much 
easier to slow the tempo and work the ball inside against Estancia, which has 
only two players over 6-feet-2. 
</P>
<P>
But Vista would have none of that, mainly because the Panthers aren't blessed 
with great size either. No player on their roster is over 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
So, off they ran. 
</P>
<P>
The game was only a game for a short time. Estancia (6-3) scored 10 points in 
the first two minutes and held Vista scoreless until 4 minutes 44 seconds were 
left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers (2-3) cut the lead to 10-4, but the Eagles went on an 18-3 run and 
ended the quarter leading, 28-7. 
</P>
<P>
"We matched up really well to them, which is unusual for us," O'Brien said. "We 
knew they were a team that liked to run and liked to shoot three-pointers. They 
just didn't do it well tonight." 
</P>
<P>
And the Panthers didn't handle the ball well either. They had eight turnovers 
in the first quarter, 25 for the game. Vista made only 18 of 51 shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles made 39 of 72 shots and had six players in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
Augustine Heredia led Estancia with 17 points before fouling out with three 
seconds left in the third quarter. He also directed the offense and ran the 
fast break, finishing with eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
When Heredia tired, Son Ly picked up the pace. Ly made five of six shots and 
added 16 points off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Estancia also dominated inside, a rare occurrence this season. The Eagles 
outrebounded the Panthers, 43-26, and Matt Fuerbgringer had 11 rebounds and 
nine points. 
</P>
<P>
"We found some good things about this win," O'Brien said. "For one thing, it 
will build our confidence." 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round Coast tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Edison 56, Cypress 25 -- The Chargers limited the Centurions to 11 points 
through three quarters. Edison led at halftime, 20-7, and then turned the game 
into a rout in the third quarter, outscoring Cypress, 18-4. Bill Martineau had 
11 points for the Chargers. Jared Rice had 13 points for the Centurions. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 61, Banning 52 -- John Molle scored 31 points to lead Irvine. The 
Vaqueros took a 17-5 lead in the first quarter and led at halftime, 33-13. 
</P>
<P>
In the Katella tournament: 
</P>
<P>
Western 76, Agoura 65 -- Sam Sabbara scored 35 points, 14 in the second 
quarter, to lead Western. The Pioneers led at the half, 39-32, but Agoura 
rallied and led, 57-56, after three quarters. Thomas Barraza scored 13 for 
Western. Sean Martin had 22 for Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
Western plays Bell Thursday at 8 p.m. in one semifinal-round game. Agoura plays 
Katella at 3:30 p.m. Thursday in a consolation quarterfinal-round game. 
</P>

ALMANAC / 1990 HIRING TRENDS : SOUTH COUNTY BOSSES SEE HIRING AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More executives in South Orange County than anywhere else in the state expect 
to be hiring during the first half of 1990. Forty percent of executives in 
South County plan to expand their permanent office staffs, contrasted with 26% 
statewide, according to a recent survey of 1,501 executives conducted by the 
Marketing Consortium in San Diego. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.5%. 
The table below includes results from a similar survey last year.

O.C. COMPANIES LOOK TO EUROPEAN MARKET IN 1990;

<P>
TRADE: AN ANAHEIM FIRM HAS DONE WHAT OTHERS ARE NOW GEARING UP TO DO -- GET A 
FOOTHOLD ABROAD FOR A SHARE OF A UNITED EUROMARKET BY 1993. POTENTIAL MARKETS 
IN THE EASTERN BLOC WILL BE THE ICING. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dyna Five Corp. hardly seems like an international trend-setter. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny Anaheim company has only about $4 million in sales annually and 
employs 25 people. The firm's brochures of computer components aren't exactly 
razzle-dazzle either. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, local international trade experts point to Dyna Five as a front-runner in 
what is shaping up as a mad dash to enter the European business community 
before the end of 1992. The reason Dyna Five finds itself in vogue is a 
subsidiary in England it opened five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Europe will become a single marketplace by the start of 1993, thereby 
eliminating all of the rules and regulations that have prevented the free 
movement of people, goods and services throughout the 12 countries that make up 
the European Community. The changes are commonly referred to as EC 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Dyna Five's Peterborough division in the United Kingdom already has about 20 
employees and does close to $2.4 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea for starting the plant was to take advantage of the European market 
as it was in 1985," said Dyna Five President R.J. Thielen. "Of course, now with 
the EC pulling together in 1992 it's even more advantageous." 
</P>
<P>
To say the least. The buzzword in business as we head into the 1990s is 
globalization and the key focus is likely to be Europe rather than the Pacific 
Rim, which was the hot spot in the 1980s. The reason is self-evident -- the EC 
encompasses 323 million relatively affluent consumers, 30% more than the 
population of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The region's combined gross domestic product was $4.5 trillion last year. 
</P>
<P>
The sweeping changes in Eastern Europe and the potential new markets those 
countries represent are the icing. 
</P>
<P>
"If companies aren't operating in all three markets -- Japan, the United States 
and Europe -- then they will probably be owned by companies that are," said 
John Graham, professor of international business at UCI. "I'm completely 
serious about that." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County companies already export more product to Europe than any other 
region in the world. The county's Office of Protocol found in a 1987 survey of 
local businesses that 80% of respondents did business in Europe versus 77% in 
the Far East. Orange County last year exported roughly $4 billion worth of 
goods -- everything from windsurfers to military plane parts -- to the European 
Community, according to the World Trade Center Assn. of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Doing business in Europe isn't easy. For instance, a manufacturer of television 
sets must make 12 different models if it wants to penetrate every market 
because product requirements vary from country to country. Household electrical 
systems for instance differ between the nations. 
</P>
<P>
And that's not all. Exporters to the EC must deal with myriad tariffs and 12 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
EC 1992 promises to do away with all of the complications, thereby ensuring a 
standardized marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
No one stands to benefit more from the changes than companies that already have 
operations in EC countries. U.S. trade experts fear that EC 1992 will erect all 
kinds of barriers to limit the entry of non-European firms into the region, a 
phenomenon now tagged "Fortress Europe." 
</P>
<P>
"We find many customers there asking if this product is made in the EC," said 
Thielen. "There is definitely a new attitude." 
</P>
<P>
So consultants are advising companies to get into the European market now, 
before it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County management needs to understand the implications of Europe in 
1992. There is a definite lack of sense of urgency," said Henry Finn, an 
international trade consultant in Irvine. "American companies must position 
themselves now to be part of the unification of Europe or be left behind." 
</P>
<P>
Finn has a step-by-step program he advises small companies to follow if they 
are interested in doing business in EC 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"You need a long-term commitment," he said. "You cannot manage markets in 
Europe with remote control." 
</P>
<P>
The first thing any businessperson must do is market research to ensure that 
the product the person is selling is something Europeans would want to buy. If 
so, find a distributor and do some test marketing. Down the road, think about 
setting up a subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies are looking to establish an office or subsidiary there," said Susan 
Lentz, executive director of the World Trade Center Assn. Santa Ana. "They want 
their goods stamped 'made in Europe' so that by 1992, they will be tagged as a 
European company rather than an American company." 
</P>
<P>
Everybody from conglomerates such as Fluor Corp. to companies the size of Dyna 
Five are looking to expand in the EC. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers are expected to flock to England or Ireland, traditional trading 
partners for the United States. But consultants suggest Orange County companies 
check into Spain, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Wage rates are going to be lower in Spain than in the U.K. so the cost of 
doing business there will be lower," Graham said. "And one edge many Southern 
California companies have is managers and employees who speak Spanish. It's a 
real competitive advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Small companies interested in going international can seek help from a variety 
of sources, including the Department of Commerce -- which is running a program 
called "Europe Now" -- as well as the World Trade Center Assn. 
</P>
<P>
If there is any doubt that EC 1992 is the wave of the future, look no farther 
than Japan. Fifteen percent of Japan's foreign investments are going into 
European projects and numerous companies such as Hitachi, Toshiba and Fujitsu 
are studying plans to build plants there. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese are investing in Europe, spending a lot of money building plants 
and establishing relationships making sure they are in the market by 1992," 
Graham said. "The window has been open for a while and it's shutting."

IN THIS CASE, PRODUCT IS TASTELESS AND THE ADVERTISEMENTS HAVE CLASS; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: THE VODKA WARS HEAT UP WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW BRANDS AND 
EXTREMELY HEAVY SPENDING FOR THE OLDER ONES, ESPECIALLY THE IMPORTS. 
</P>

<P>
Rarely has something so tasteless prompted so many claims of class. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, at least 10 new labels of pricey imported vodka, shipped from 
such places as Iceland, Denmark, Poland and Norway, have swamped bar shelves 
and liquor stores. One upper-crust brand, Denaka, insists that it "stands out" 
from the rest. Another, Icy, swears it is an "absolute improvement," taking a 
swipe at its famous competitor, Absolut. 
</P>
<P>
None, of course, mentions the fact that vodka, no matter how high-priced, is 
conspicuously devoid of taste. Instead, each new marketer is stressing its 
vodka's smoothness as well as the cachet of an exotic country. "It's like 
nuclear proliferation," said Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a Los 
Angeles-based food and beverage consulting company. "Everyone is racing to 
build the biggest bomb." 
</P>
<P>
And what a race it is. Newcomers to the $240-million imported-vodka market -- 
roughly 8% of total U.S. vodka sales -- are pouring millions of dollars into ad 
campaigns that take potshots at No. 1 import Absolut, a Swedish vodka 
distributed by Carillon Importers Ltd. of Teaneck, N.J., that lays claim to 
roughly 60% of imported vodka sales. 
</P>
<P>
Absolut is countering with lavish magazine advertisements, including an 
eight-page layout in Vogue that features designer clothing made especially for 
Absolut. On another front, Absolut fired off a lawsuit against a rival vodka 
importer to stop a parody of the long-running Absolut ad campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Imported vodka is one of the few growth areas in a steadily declining liquor 
industry. Hard-liquor sales, after seven years of stagnation, dipped 2% in 1988 
and a similar decline is expected this year, according to M. Shanken 
Communications Inc., which publishes several beverage-industry publications. 
Prompting the decline is a health-conscious America's diminishing taste for 
whiskey and other so-called "brown goods": From 1987 through 1988, total U.S. 
whiskey sales dropped 3.2%, according to Jobson Beverage Alcohol Group, another 
publisher of liquor trade magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sales of premium-priced vodka jumped an average of 24% each year 
from 1980 through 1988, exploding during that period from 500,000 cases to 3.2 
million cases, Shanken reported. While imports make up only 8% of total vodka 
sales, their galloping growth has driven overall vodka sales from 18.8% of 
total spirits sales in 1980 to 21.4% last year. 
</P>
<P>
With drinkers willing to pay $5 to $8 more per bottle for the imported stuff, 
observers say manufacturers and distributors are earning up to $50 per 
premium-vodka case -- a nice profit margin by liquor-industry standards. For 
example, a 750-milliliter bottle of Smirnoff, the leading domestic vodka, 
retails in New York for roughly $8, contrasted with about $12 a bottle for 
Absolut. 
</P>
<P>
However, Absolut isn't about to give up its No. 1 spot without a fight. The 
Carillon brand upped its $20-million ad budget by an estimated 25% this year, 
and the extra money will help increase the number of magazines carrying 
Absolut's consistently lavish and groundbreaking magazine advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, the brand's expensive ads have earned it widespread 
attention in magazine and newspaper articles, helping Absolut go from 5,000 
cases in 1979 to an estimated 2.5 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Typifying its use of the spectacular, Absolut surprised Vanity Fair readers 
this month with an ad in which a "voice" wished them "Merry Christmas" in 
English, Italian and Spanish when they opened the magazine. Employing a tiny, 
battery-operated computer chip, the ad cost about $1 million to produce. That 
expense, along with Absolut's other lavish promotions, eventually shows up in 
the price. Said one industry consultant, "They have to make at least $5 a case 
just to cover advertising spending." 
</P>
<P>
Other brands looking for a toehold have launched direct assaults on Absolut. 
Louisville, Ky.-based Brown-Forman Corp. last winter ushered in Icy, an import 
from Iceland, with a blatantly derivative trade-advertising campaign featuring 
the slogan, "Absolute Improvement." The ads so infuriated Carillon it sued for 
trademark infringement. 
</P>
<P>
Brown-Forman has since revised the ad theme. But Denaka, a Danish vodka 
imported by Buckingham Wile Co., continues to allude to the leader with its 
print headline, "In a world of absolutes, Denaka excels." 
</P>
<P>
A bit more subtle, Tanqueray Sterling Vodka, imported from England by 
Schieffelin &amp; Somerset Co. in New York and introduced nationally this year, 
illustrates its ads with a bottle as starkly lit as Absolut's and an equally 
cocky tag-line: "At last, perfection in a vodka." 
</P>
<P>
The imperative to remain competitive is especially urgent for Palace Brands' 
Finlandia, which has been around since the early 1970s and is No. 3 in the 
category, after Stolichnaya. The recent rash of introductions prompted the 
brand to come out for the first time with its own spectacular Christmas ad, 
breaking in New York magazine and Rolling Stone. The ad, created by Finlandia's 
agency, Young &amp; Rubicam, features a hologram of the Finlandia bottle that 
cost $400,000 to produce and print. 
</P>
<P>
And the segment continues to grow. This year Monsieur Henri Wines Ltd., which 
imports Stolichnaya from the Soviet Union, extended the Stoli brand name by 
launching high-end and low-end Soviet imports -- Stolichnaya Cristall and 
Priviet, respectively. Cristall retails for about $20, contrasted with $10 for 
Priviet. 
</P>
<P>
Another launch, Elduris from Glenmore Distilleries Co., increases to two the 
number of vodka imports from Iceland. And the House of Seagram plans to 
reintroduce Wyborowa vodka, bringing Poland into the fray. Even Smirnoff is 
dipping into the super-premium waters with Smirnoff Silver Private Reserve, 
currently being test-marketed.

CALIFORNIA'S 'COAL MINING' NO THREAT TO BIG PRODUCERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
IONE, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America's coal states -- Pennsylvania, West Virginia and the like -- may have 
been surprised to see California pop up on the federal list of coal-producing 
states. 
</P>
<P>
But the major producers needn't worry about competition: There's hardly any 
coal mined in California and it is hardly coal anyway -- it is lignite, 
produced mostly for its natural vegetable wax content rather than fuel value. 
</P>
<P>
Only one mining company has been active in recent years, although another is 
getting ready for production. 
</P>
<P>
California lignite was first mined in 1861 near Mt. Diablo, east of San 
Francisco. It fueled much of the rapid Gold Rush growth of the San Francisco 
Bay Area until yielding to better fuels around the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
The next significant production resumed about 1948 near the town of Ione, about 
100 miles east of San Francisco, by American Lignite Products Co., which uses 
it to make montan wax, used in shoe polish, carbon paper, candles and makeup. 
</P>
<P>
The mining of lignite for its wax does not have to be reported to the federal 
government. But mining it as a fuel does. So here's how the federal government 
got into the picture, and California got on its list: 
</P>
<P>
After nearly 40 years of mining -- recently about 50,000 tons a year -- 
American Lignite had a stockpile of waxless lignite covering 20 acres to a 
depth of 30 feet. Despite its low ranking on the scale of combustible mineral 
solids, the million-ton pile still represented a considerable mass of BTUs. So 
the company decided to build a steam plant and burn the lignite to produce 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
The $38-million plant went on line in 1987 and, presto, California re-emerged 
as a coal-producing state. 
</P>
<P>
In the words of the general manager of American Lignite, Patrick J. Volkar, 
"The federal people now construe that as coal mining." 
</P>
<P>
American Lignite, through its sister company Ione Energy, produces about 17 
megawatts, with two megawatts used to lower costs in the wax operation to stay 
competitive with the world's only other montan wax producer in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The other 15 megawatts go to the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., which is 
required to buy them under federal legislation adopted during the fuel crises 
of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
A firm that neighbors American Lignite, the Carbondale Mining Co., is getting 
ready to mine lignite from the same formation as American Lignite, to generate 
electricity at a plant on the site. Consulting geologist and manager David 
Sanders says 416,000 tons a year are projected to fire the 50-megawatt plant. 
The company is negotiating to sell the power directly to municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
At both companies, the type of mining is open-pit. But California's early 
lignite producers had to tunnel for it. One of their mines near Mt. Diablo has 
been converted into an underground museum. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Mt. Diablo was on the lips of the citizens of the town of Benicia 
in 1848 when Charles Bennett of Sacramento stopped there while traveling to 
Monterey to secure for John Sutter the grant of land on which gold had just 
been discovered in Coloma. 
</P>
<P>
California Geology magazine said in a 1980 article that Bennett, a Sutter 
associate, "found the people of the town excited about a coal discovery near 
Mt. Diablo." 
</P>
<P>
It was disillusioned gold seekers who finally in 1861 began mining the Mt. 
Diablo lignite, which is in the Domengine Formation of the middle Eocene Epoch 
of 40 million to 52 million years ago -- similar to the Ione Formation. Both 
formed in river deltas and swamps during a warm, moist climate. Both also 
contain quartz sand and clays. 
</P>
<P>
While coal or lignite of some kind has been found in 47 of California's 58 
counties, significant quantities have been mined only at Mt. Diablo in Contra 
Costa County, Corral Hollow in nearby Alameda County, Stone Canyon in Monterey 
County, and Alberhill in Riverside County, as well as Ione in Amador County. 
</P>
<P>
The early Mt. Diablo lignite had to compete with imports of high-grade coal 
from Pennsylvania, Britain, Australia and Chile. But industry was growing fast. 
In 30 years from the early 1860s to the early 1890s, the demand grew 19-fold on 
only a four-fold growth in population. 
</P>
<P>
The largest operators at Mt. Diablo were the Pittsburg Co. and the Black 
Diamond Co. Black Diamond reportedly employed 315 men in 1870, the area's peak 
year, including 110 coal cutters and miners -- mostly Welsh, Irish, Italian and 
Pennsylvanians.

NEW EXCEL NEEDS MORE IMPROVEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Not a moment too soon, Hyundai has introduced a new, improved Excel. It is just 
a bit longer, more powerful and a little more expensive than last year's model. 
</P>
<P>
It is better basic transportation, but still not quite equal to the Japanese 
competition. Then again, neither is its window sticker. 
</P>
<P>
The Excel was the first South Korean car to be sold in the United States when 
it was introduced in 1986. Few Americans had heard of its manufacturer and few 
could pronounce the company's name correctly (it rhymes with Sunday). The car 
caught on, though, and more than 800,000 Excels have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
But the Excel's prices, which once began at just under $5,000, have crept 
upward to a base price $7,294 (including destination charge) because of 
currency exchange rates and inflation. Meanwhile, the demand for small cars has 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
The result was predictable: Hyundai's U.S. sales have fallen by almost 30% so 
far this year below last year's level. Hyundai is hoping that the 1990 Excel 
and the larger Sonata introduced earlier will change that. 
</P>
<P>
The new Excel has smoother lines that reduce its wind resistance and make it 
more contemporary. But perhaps the most important change is a 20% increase in 
horsepower, attributable mostly to electronic fuel injection. With a 1.5-liter, 
four-cylinder engine producing a claimed 81 horsepower, the Excel still won't 
outrun a Corvette, but it is better able now to keep up with the pack. 
</P>
<P>
The five-speed manual transmission, standard in certain Excels, is new and 
shifts easily. The clutch was easy to get used to, though our time with the 
Excel was cut short when, without warning, the clutch began slipping badly. 
Last we heard, the car was being trucked to the West Coast where Hyundai 
technicians will try to diagnose the problem. 
</P>
<P>
For such unhappy times, every Hyundai comes with free membership for one year 
in the Cross Country Auto Club. 
</P>
<P>
A four-speed electronically controlled transmission, available optionally, also 
is new. 
</P>
<P>
The Excel is available as a two-door hatchback, four-door hatchback and 
four-door sedan. It comes with four levels of standard equipment and trim: 
plain, GS, GL and GLS. Only the four-door sedan can be ordered in GLS version, 
which begins at $8,774, including destination charge. 
</P>
<P>
Most Hyundai controls are similar to those found in Japanese economy cars. The 
Excel is, in fact, derived from the Mirage made by Mitsubishi, which owns 15% 
of Hyundai. 
</P>
<P>
Hyundai claims better handling for the new Excel, thanks to front suspension 
revisions. But, even with those changes and with rack-and-pinion steering and 
front and rear stabilizer bars, the Excel still cannot be considered a sport 
sedan. That is one reason we don't think it is equal to Japanese entries like 
the Honda Civic. 
</P>
<P>
The other reason is reliability. Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports 
magazine, says its surveys show 1988 Excels "average" in their frequency of 
repair. That's an improvement over "much worse than average" for 1987 models, 
but most Japanese models do better.

GIANT SUNKIST CONSIDERING A MOVE INTO FLORIDA; 
</P>
<P>
CITRUS: BECAUSE OF THE DIM POSSIBILITY OF GROWING MORE FRUIT IN CALIFORNIA AND 
ARIZONA, THE PACKING AND MARKETING COMPANY HAS TURNED ITS EYES EAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sunkist Growers Inc., the citrus farmers' cooperative whose well-known 
trademark has made it a dominant force among Arizona and California growers, is 
considering expanding into Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The cooperative is thinking about selling fruit from Florida because there's 
little chance of expanding citrus production in Arizona and California due to 
urban encroachment on citrus groves and the skyrocketing costs of water in the 
Southwest. Florida remains the state with the largest citrus crop. 
</P>
<P>
The cooperative, based in Sherman Oaks, is projected to do nearly $1 billion in 
sales in 1989. It has sent three teams of executives and directors to Florida 
to talk with growers and packers of lemons, tangerines and grapefruit. A fourth 
team will visit the state in January to talk with orange growers. 
</P>
<P>
But Sunkist officials stressed that they haven't yet decided whether to expand 
to Florida. "We don't have a consensus even among our current members," Sunkist 
President Russell L. Hanlin said. "It's too early even to put the question to 
them." The cooperative may make a decision next summer, said Curtis W. 
Anderson, vice president of public relations. 
</P>
<P>
Sunkist is a grower-owned cooperative of about 6,000 citrus farmers in Arizona 
and California who account for about 65% of citrus fruit production in the two 
states. The cooperative packs the growers' fruit, advertises and sells it, then 
pays the growers most of the proceeds back, minus a fee. For the growers, it 
saves the work and worry of actually marketing their fruit. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, when Sunkist had revenues of about $887 million, it returned about 
$640 million to members, and after Sunkist's costs of $241 million, the 
cooperative's retained income was $6 million before taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The cooperative is best known for its sales of fresh fruit under the Sunkist 
name, coined by ad men in 1909. But it also was paid about $10 million in 1988 
under licensing agreements that allow other companies to use the name. Cadbury 
Schweppes Inc., for example, sells Sunkist orange drink. 
</P>
<P>
If Sunkist decides to sell Florida fruit, it would probably not seek new 
members there, at least early on. The cooperative would simply charge a fee to 
market the citrus and then plow back the profits from selling Florida fruit to 
reduce fees for its California and Arizona growers. It could later seek members 
in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The impetus for expanding comes from a need to keep pace with the recent 
consolidations of grocery chains. "We don't want to be whip-sawed simply by the 
disparity in size between the buyer and the seller," Hanlin said. As the market 
chains get bigger, they demand lower prices and a more consistent supply of 
fruit. 
</P>
<P>
With 33 sales offices throughout North America, Anderson said, Sunkist has 
plenty of excess capacity to market more fruit without spending more money. 
</P>
<P>
But California and Arizona -- despite their size -- don't have much room left 
for new citrus groves. The two states have lost about 40,000 acres of 
citrus-growing land in the last five to eight years, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the high cost of water where there is room to expand -- in places 
like the eastern San Joaquin Valley -- makes it unlikely that citrus production 
throughout Arizona and California will do more than level out in the next few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In Florida, it's a different story. Although the state lost more than 200,000 
acres of citrus groves as a result of freezes in 1983 and 1985, new groves are 
being planted, especially in southern Florida. Hanlin said, "We believe as the 
Florida crop grows, they're going to need some additions to their marketing 
facilities." 
</P>
<P>
What does Florida think about Sunkist's idea? 
</P>
<P>
"The citrus industry is growing and there's room for everybody," said Cathy 
Clay, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Citrus, which levies a fee on 
growers and spends about $77 million a year advertising the state's fruit. 
Florida does have some citrus cooperatives, but none on a scale to match 
Sunkist. 
</P>
<P>
Although 94% of Florida-grown oranges and about 57% of its grapefruit wind up 
as juice, rather than sold fresh in grocery stores, Sunkist would concentrate 
on marketing Florida fruit fresh. That would reflect the cooperative's current 
emphasis; about 70% of California and Arizona fruit is sold whole. 
</P>
<P>
Florida's humidity helps produce juicier oranges than those typically grown 
here. By comparison, cool nights in California and Arizona make for 
better-looking fruit.

VATICAN CITES WORLD LAW, WON'T YIELD NORIEGA TO U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Vatican, citing international law, said today that it will not simply push 
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega out of its embassy in Panama and hand him over to 
U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, in Corpus Christi, Tex., for the start of a six-day hunting and 
fishing vacation, said he was unaware of the Vatican statement. But "that 
complicates things if they said that," Bush said when asked about it by 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro also said the Vatican has not discussed with 
any countries the possibility of arranging exile for Noriega, who turned 
himself in to the Vatican Embassy in Panama City on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Cuba, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic have been reported to be contenders 
for accepting the ousted Panamanian leader. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too soon," Navarro told a news briefing. He added that "as of this 
moment," the Vatican has not made a decision about Noriega's bid for asylum 
status. 
</P>
<P>
Navarro was pressed repeatedly about Bush Administration assertions that the 
U.S. officials have forcefully demanded that Noriega be turned over to U.S. 
authorities so he can be tried on drug-trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States has put its case very clearly and with respect and very 
cordially," Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican presented its case "with the same clarity," Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
"Taking into account international law and accepted procedure, I don't see how 
the embassy can hand over someone" to a nation other than the host country, he 
said. He added that the Panamanian government installed last week has not 
requested that Noriega be handed over to it. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican spokesman declined to comment on the U.S. criminal accusations 
against Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
But, Navarro said, "he has also been head of government and of the armed 
forces. There's something more than a criminal case here." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters aboard Air Force 
One en route to Texas that Noriega "can talk about the CIA and Bush until he's 
blue in the face. It won't hurt anything." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring to things Noriega might reveal about his previous close 
relations with the U.S. government, including the period in the 1970s when Bush 
was CIA director and Noriega was an intelligence source. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, taking questions yelled above the roar of helicopter rotors at a naval 
air station, said there will be "no time limit" on negotiations over Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
The President defended his decision to take the year-end vacation in view of 
the Panama situation, claiming that he does not think it amounts to shirking 
his responsibility as chief executive during a time of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not concerned about that at all. Why should I be?" he said. "Things have 
gone well. It's winding down." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he will stay in constant touch with his national security advisers in 
Washington by telephone, "by secure link," and he noted that Secretary of State 
James A. Baker III had come along with him for part of the vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, I don't make any cover. I'm going to be enjoying myself and I think the 
American people understand that," he said. "I think I've worked pretty hard all 
year."

<TEXT>
<P>
Two days after he was severely injured when he crashed his bicycle into a 
limousine, a cyclist has been identified by relatives, La Habra police said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Solorzano Mendoza of Buena Park, in his late 20s, was listed in critical 
condition at UCI Medical Center, where he has been semiconscious with head 
injuries since the accident on Christmas Day, police and hospital officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives who identified the man Tuesday night were unsure of the man's age, 
Police Sgt. Tom Machado said. 
</P>
<P>
Mendoza reportedly swerved his 10-speed bicycle across several lanes of traffic 
and crashed into the side of the Cadillac limousine about 12:25 p.m. Monday on 
La Habra Boulevard near Marian Street, suffering head injuries, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
He struck a car driven by limousine company owner Edward Dexter, 62, of 
Whittier, who was taking his mother-in-law to the hospital for treatment of an 
undisclosed ailment, police said. Dexter was not cited.

$1-MILLION GOLD HEIST IN DOWNTOWN; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: WELL-DRESSED ROBBERS ESCAPE JEWELRY CENTER AFTER TYING UP SEVEN VICTIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two well-dressed armed men robbed a downtown manufacturing jewelry shop this 
morning and escaped with nearly $1 million in gold after taping and handcuffing 
seven victims. 
</P>
<P>
The holdup occurred at the Rope Mine Corp. on the sixth floor of a jewelry 
center building at 610 S. Broadway, Detective Lt. Robert Kurth said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the largest haul from the downtown jewelry district in recent years, 
robbery detectives reported. 
</P>
<P>
Five employees and the two owners of the firm were held at gunpoint by the 
pair, described as possible Iranians in their 30s, said Kurth, head of the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Central Station detectives. 
</P>
<P>
"They were readily admitted to the store in the tight security building shortly 
before 8 a.m. on posing as customers," Kurth said. 
</P>
<P>
"They displayed guns and then taped and handcuffed those inside. They helped 
themselves to some 47 to 50 kilos (up to 110 pounds) of gold dust, ingots and 
other forms of the precious metal used in making gold rope chains by the firm. 
</P>
<P>
"The suspects left a short time later after putting the gold in two briefcases 
they were carrying when they came in." 
</P>
<P>
Kurth said no other jewelers or security guards in the building were aware a 
robbery was in progress, even though the robbers apparently had to escape past 
a security guard station. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way they (the robbers) could escape was by walking past the security 
desk at the front door of the building," Kurth said. 
</P>
<P>
It took the victims 15 to 20 minutes to remove their restraints before they 
were able to call police for help, according to the official report.

Police have frozen between $3.4 million and $4.3 million held in French bank 
accounts by ousted Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega, judicial 
sources said in Paris today. 
</P>
<P>
The order came from a French magistrate investigating allegations that the 
accounts may have been used to launder profits from illegal drug trafficking, 
the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
They said at least five accounts in the names of Noriega and members of his 
family have been frozen since Friday. The money was deposited with at least two 
French banks, the Credit Industriel et Commercial and the Banque Nationale de 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
The magistrate acted after French authorities were tipped off by U.S. 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The French sources said part or all of the cash held in France was about to be 
moved to Luxembourg when police moved in. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Justice Department said today it asked authorities in France 
and three other European countries to freeze bank accounts where it believes 
Noriega stashed millions of dollars in illegal drug profits. 
</P>
<P>
"We have taken steps today in four European countries to freeze assets in 
numerous" accounts, said David Runkel, the department's chief spokesman. 
Officials said Noriega hid at least $10 million in the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
As the department sought to gain control of Noriega's money, U.S. officials in 
Panama and Washington negotiated with the Vatican, whose embassy in Panama City 
took in an exhausted Noriega and 10 associates who sought asylum Sunday. 
Noriega's regime was toppled Dec. 20 by U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials sent letters to authorities in France, Switzerland, Luxembourg 
and Britain asking them to halt transactions in the bank accounts belonging to 
the deposed Panamanian dictator, Runkel said. 
</P>
<P>
Based on records seized in Panama, U.S. officials believe they can document 
that the money in the overseas accounts stemmed from Noriega's alleged drug 
dealing, Runkel said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to demonstrate to the banking officials" that the money was 
earned illegally, he added. He said "preliminary discussions" were under way 
with other countries where Noriega has money. 
</P>
<P>
While the Justice Department is trying to freeze $10 million, the State 
Department estimates Noriega's worth at about $200 million to $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech last August, Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger 
alluded to multimillion-dollar transactions Noriega has made over the last two 
years involving accounts in West Germany, Switzerland and Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department attorneys are confident that banking officials in the four 
European countries will cooperate with their request. "We've had a remarkable 
display of international cooperation," Runkel said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said there is a possibility that Noriega, his family or his bankers have 
already transferred the money out of some of the accounts since the U.S. 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Freezing the accounts is the first step in a process to seize the assets, 
Runkel said. Distribution of the money, however, would be governed by the laws 
of the countries where the cash is hidden.

The Second District Court of Appeal in Ventura today temporarily suspended an

</P>
<P>
The injunction had ordered the state to restore full funding to family planning 
clinics, ruling that Gov. George Deukmejian's two-thirds cut in the $36-million 
program violated state welfare law by depriving health care to thousands of 
poor women. The state appealed the ruling, requesting a stay, and the court 
currently is reviewing the state's appeal.

A Japanese merchant has been arrested for trying to smuggle nearly 300 
protected lizards and turtles to Tokyo in suitcases, many with their mouths 
taped shut, authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildlife Division statement said Tsuyoshi Shirawa was arrested Sunday night 
while preparing to board a flight to Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife officials found 283 reptiles crammed into four of his suitcases. All 
were rare species protected by Thai law, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Most had their mouths taped shut to prevent them from making noise, the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>

Vietnam, staunchly resisting Eastern European-style reforms that could threaten 
Communist Party rule, adopted a law today reasserting strict control of the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
Hanoi radio, monitored in Bangkok, said the National Assembly unanimously 
decided that "it is not necessary to let the private sector operate newspapers, 
especially in our nation's present conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Under the law the government must approve new newspapers and the appointment or 
dismissal of editors-in-chief. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese people, particularly in the south, have criticized the draft press 
law and advocated privately run media with more freedom.

Article 5 of the draft bill forbids the media to "promulgate against party 
policy and rules, state law, against socialism, destroy the solidarity of the 
people, cause suspicions, (or) make people lose their convictions."

A masterpiece by the 19th-Century French painter Theodore Rousseau has been 
stolen in a daring heist from a museum in the central Soviet city of Penza, it 
was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The work, "Before a Thunderstorm," was taken from the Central Picture Gallery 
in Penza, an industrial city of 540,000 about 450 miles southeast of Moscow. It 
had been hanging there since 1891. 
</P>
<P>
Rousseau (1812-1867) was a leader of a group of landscape painters known 
collectively as the Barbizon School. "Before a Thunderstorm" is a prized 
example of his depiction of nature as a wild and undisciplined force. 
</P>
<P>
"The crime is an extraordinary one," Yuri Igonin, deputy chief of internal 
affairs, told Sovietskaya Rossiya newspaper. He said there was a sloppy 
response to the heist by the local militia, who responded to the break-in alarm 
by merely telephoning the guards at the gallery.

Ice on the Mississippi River today forced the Coast Guard to ban nighttime 
barge traffic from Cairo, Ill., to the Arkansas-Louisiana border, delaying 
shipments of heating oil, coal and grain. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions will stay in place indefinitely along the 450-mile stretch of 
the river where 10 barges have run aground since Christmas Day, Lt. Cmdr. Rick 
Kowalewski said. Chunks of ice floating downstream have knocked over buoys 
marking the navigation channel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the reasons why we are allowing only daylight operation," 
Kowalewski said. "(The buoys) are hard to use during the day and impossible at 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Besides daylight-only navigation, the Coast Guard is limiting the size of tows. 
Towboats can carry only 20 barges southbound and up to 24 northbound, but no 
more than 15 of the northbound barges can be loaded, the commander said.

Share prices in Tokyo sailed ahead today, propelled by index-linked buying and 
scattered buying by investment trust funds, arbitragers and individual 
investors.

<P>
The 225-share Nikkei rose 120.32 points or 0.31% to a record 38,801.63 after 
soaring 257.69 points Tuesday. Turnover today was about 900 million shares, up 
from 600 million Tuesday.

Both high-priced and bargain stocks were magnets in brisk trade.

<P>
Traders attributed the two-day market revival to widespread relief over the 
discount rate rise on Monday, year-end binges and bulging pocket books of 
Japanese corporations and institutions.

The Panama Canal will be open for 20 hours today and should return to 24-hour 
operation Thursday, a spokesman at the Atlantic-Pacific waterway's headquarters 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the number of ships passing through the canal can go to around 30 
tomorrow and over 40 by Friday," Panama Canal Commission Secretary Michael 
Rhode said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the White House said the canal was again operating 24 hours a day, 
but this was denied by a canal spokeswoman in Panama who said it was operating 
at only 16 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Rhode said the canal has been unable to operate at 24 hours so far because not 
all the 8,500 workers at the waterway have returned to their jobs because of 
transportation problems in the wake of the U.S. invasion.

Accountants in Arizona are pessimistic about the state's economy although they 
do not feel that a recession is likely, according to a poll released today by 
the Arizona Society of Certified Public Accountants. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 600 CPAs who were polled, 66% said the state's economy is bad, 29% said 
it is normal and only 5% said it is good. A year ago, 30% rated the economy as 
bad, 56% said it was normal and 14% rated it as good. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 survey also showed that 56% think there will be no change in the 
economy by the mid-1990s with 29% saying conditions will improve and 14% 
predicting a worsening state economy. 
</P>
<P>
Two strong areas in the Arizona economy, the CPAs said, are high technology and 
tourism.

LEATHERFACE + ROARING CHAINSAW = TEXAS MASSACRE III 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What the world doesn't need is another face in filmdom's rogues' gallery of 
homicidal maniacs, but that's what it is getting. 
</P>
<P>
It should have been enough that Michael Myers of "Halloween," Freddy Krueger of 
"Nightmare on Elm Street" and Jason Voorhees of "Friday the 13th" could be 
counted on for annual appearances in slasher-horror pictures. 
</P>
<P>
But mark the name of Junior Sawyer, aka Leatherface, who soon will be seen 
wielding his dismembering weapon in "Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 
III." 
</P>
<P>
In the first two "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" epics the role of Leatherface was 
played by two different actors. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it is R. A. Mihailoff's turn. He will be seen next month in the role of 
the mad killer and, moreover, he has signed for two sequels. 
</P>
<P>
Mihailoff is a tall, balding party of some 200-pounds-plus with a scraggly 
beard and fierce eyes. He is not exactly a thing of beauty in or out of makeup, 
but when wearing the leather mask -- which only partically covers his face -- 
Mihailoff could scare the larceny out of Michael, Jason and Freddy. 
</P>
<P>
It is Mihailoff's somewhat limited ambition in life to become as closely 
associated with Leatherface as has Kane Hodder with Jason and Robert Englund 
with Freddy. 
</P>
<P>
He definitely plans to avoid the fate of the several unremembered actors who 
have played Michael Myers. 
</P>
<P>
Of them all, Leatherface is the most violently vile. Whereas Freddy relies on 
his bladed fingers and Jason and Michael kill with whatever is at hand, 
Leatherface uses the ultimate weapon -- a roaring chainsaw. 
</P>
<P>
Although all four lunatics have a common bond of frenzy, none seems to be 
motivated out of revenge, jealousy, rage or even deep melancholy. They simply 
kill. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mihailoff is anxious to continue playing Leatherface, he also looks 
forward to being seen in roles without a mask. 
</P>
<P>
"It's harder to act when people can't see your face," he said. "I have to use a 
lot of body language. But there's enough space around my eyes and part of my 
mouth, so I do a lot of heavy breathing and eye woggling. 
</P>
<P>
"For me playing Leatherface is a childhood dream come true. Since I was a 
little kid I've been a horror fan. Twenty-five years ago I used to read Famous 
Monsters of Filmland and pretend I was one of them."

LORIMAR BANISHES TAYLOR'S NAME

<TEXT>
<P>
The Lorimar Studios changed the name of the Robert Taylor Building after 
producers and tenants complained in a petition that the late actor testified 
before Congress against Hollywood artists. 
</P>
<P>
The petitioners wanted Taylor's name banished because the actor testified 
before the old House Un-American Activities Committee against the so-called 
Hollywood 10, and he was considered a supporter of the Hollywood blacklist. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Shupack, senior vice president and general manager of Lorimar, was given 
the petition in September, and the name change was approved on Nov. 15, his 
office said today. 
</P>
<P>
Shupack changed the structure's name to the George Cukor Building. Cukor 
directed most of his films on the lot Lorimar took over from MGM. 
</P>
<P>
Before MGM sold the lot, the 74-year-old building was called the Lion Building. 
When Lorimar took over two years ago, the studio changed the name of the old 
buildings in favor of honoring former movie stars. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor died of lung cancer in June, 1969.

A 33-year-old Christmas episode of "I Love Lucy" made the Top 10 in the Nielsen 
ratings and was CBS' highest-rated show for the week ended Dec. 24. 
</P>
<P>
The show, starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, was sixth in the ratings. It 
was the first telecast of the black and white episode since Dec. 24, 1956. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's "Cheers" was the top show, ABC's "Roseanne" was second, and to the 
surprise of no one, NBC was the top-ranked network overall. CBS pulled its own 
surprise by finishing second for the second week in a row. ABC was third. 
</P>
<P>
Fox Broadcasting's "Married . . . With Children" plunged to a tie for 72nd 
place after the series' Christmas special the week before was 13th. That was 
the highest rank achieved so far by a Fox show. 
</P>
<P>
It was not a great week for Christmas specials, other than the demonstration 
that Lucy can still pull in an audience. CBS' "Frosty the Snowman" was 20th, 
CBS' "A Very Brady Christmas" was 21st. CBS' "Charlie Brown Christmas" tied for 
30th, CBS' "Claymation Christmas" tied for 41st, NBC's "Christmas in 
Washington" tied for 56th, and CBS' "A Christmas Carol" tied for 62nd. The 
latter tied with a rerun of "Murder, She Wrote."

Civil rights leader Hosea Williams, who has organized a Christmas dinner for 
the homeless and hungry for 19 years, is hospitalized with bronchitis and 
pneumonia but plans to get back into action soon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm feeling much better, and I hope to be released in a few days," Williams 
said Tuesday in a telephone interview from his room at Emory Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 64, said his annual Christmas and Thanksgiving feasts since 1970 have 
fed nearly half a million people at a cost of nearly $1 million and used 65,000 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"This was our 19th year, and I'd say we fed a total of about 35,000 at the 
Christmas dinner, counting the deliveries to sick and old people at their 
homes," he said. "You watch these families eating, and you realize, if they 
didn't eat here, where would they eat? They'd just go to bed hungry." 
</P>
<P>
Williams said the program has expanded so much that he is going to turn it into 
a year-round operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I've a job, a real obligation to feed the hungry. They're the fastest-growing 
population in Atlanta, even more so than the homeless. A lot of people have 
homes, they live here, but they have nothing to eat," Williams said.

world cycling titles this year, was named as the year's top athlete today by 
L'Equipe, the French sports daily newspaper. The American cyclist received 254 
points. Boris Becker, U.S. Open and Wimbledon tennis champion, was second with 
177 points. His compatriot, Steffi Graf, who won the women's titles at 
Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, was third with 162 points. 
</P>
<P>
Track and field star Carl Lewis and tennis star Martina Navratilova were picked 
as the best athletes of the 1980s in an international survey by Italy's largest

OREGON IGNORES SUIT, BEGINS BETTING ON NBA

The Oregon Lottery's venture into sports with wagering on professional football 
expanded today into basketball over strong protests and a lawsuit from the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
The new version of the betting game Sports Action includes outcomes of the 
weekend's National Basketball Assn. contests. (See Durslag, C3.) 
</P>
<P>
The lottery has been operating the weekly Sports Action game based on National 
Football League contests since Sept. 6. The new version of the game will 
include both football and basketball until the NFL playoffs end in late 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Action tickets go on sale each Wednesday for the coming weekend's games. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery Director Jim Davey said Tuesday that the new version of the game was 
all set despite the fact that the NBA took legal action last week seeking to 
prohibit sales. 
</P>
<P>
No restraining order was requested in the lawsuit brought in federal court in 
Eugene, and Davey said no date has been set for a court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is on," he said, urging bettors not to hold back because of the legal 
cloud. 
</P>
<P>
"People shouldn't hesitate in buying tickets because of the lawsuit," Davey 
said. "It's not going to impact them one way or the other." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL protested when the lottery began its football game, the only one of its 
kind in the country, but did not take legal action. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA argues that the game will unfairly exploit the league's property 
rights, infringe on trademarks and violate federal gambling laws and state 
constitutional provisions. 
</P>
<P>
The betting system for NBA-related games is the same as for the football game: 
About 14 basketball games will be listed on each weekend's betting lineup. Bets 
will be based on point spreads developed by a Las Vegas odds maker. Bettors can 
wager at least $1 on three to 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Portland Trail Blazers are not included in the game in what Davey said was 
a courtesy to the home state team.

GRETZKY'S SKATES DON'T NEED THE ROCKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAL BOCK, AP SPORTS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On one of their goodwill tours of Canada a couple of years ago, Soviet hockey 
officials were ushered into a Hall of Fame exhibit at Quebec City. 
</P>
<P>
As they moved through the displays of hockey memorabilia, the Soviets were 
impressed. Then they got to the case holding Wayne Gretzky's first pair of 
skates, a Spartan set of kids' skates with a small boot, a strap over the top 
and wide blades. There, they became mesmerized. 
</P>
<P>
"The expression on their faces was one of wonder," said Scotty Morrison, 
president of the Hall of Fame. "They seemed amazed that these simple skates 
could have belonged to Gretzky. They looked at them as if they expected to find 
tiny rockets on the backs of them." 
</P>
<P>
They didn't, of course. Gretzky supplies his own propulsion. 
</P>
<P>
His accomplishments are not built on speed, size or brawn. Other players are 
faster, bigger and stronger. The Kings' Gretzky thrives instead on a sort of 
sixth sense about the game, an innate intelligence about where to be, when to 
be there and what to do when he gets there. He is a Rembrandt on skates, an 
artist excelling at a most demanding craft. 
</P>
<P>
Even on the other side of the hockey world, Gretzky is the best known player in 
his sport, a man who dominated the game from the moment he first stepped on the 
ice. He is honored now as the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Decade. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky received 307 votes in balloting by a panel of sports writers and 
broadcasters, far outdistancing quarterback Joe Montana of the San Francisco 
49ers, who had 85. Magic Johnson of the Lakers was third with 59, followed by 
Carl Lewis (12), Nolan Ryan (11), Larry Bird (5), Bo Jackson (4) and Walter 
Payton (3). 
</P>
<P>
By age 20, Gretzky broke the NHL single-season scoring record. He's been 
scoring in bunches ever since and, as the decade ends, he holds or shares 10 
career, 15 playoff and 20 regular-season records. 
</P>
<P>
How good is Gretzky? 
</P>
<P>
Consider hat tricks, the scoring of three goals in a game: Marcel Dionne, who 
retired this season after 18 years in the league, had 25 of them. Gretzky in 
his first 10 seasons had 32, as well as nine four-goal games and four five-goal 
games. 
</P>
<P>
That's how good. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Gretzky's most cherished record came in the first days of the current 
season, when he passed Gordie Howe to become, at 28, the highest scorer in NHL 
history. Howe scored 1,850 points in 26 seasons and 1,767 games. Gretzky passed 
him in his 11th season and 780th game. 
</P>
<P>
Consider that. The highest scorer in history. More points than any other player 
in the history of the game. More than legends such as Rocket Richard and Bobby 
Hull. More than Bobby Orr and Phil Esposito. More than anybody. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky starred for 10 years in Edmonton before being traded to Los Angeles 
before the 1988 season. The move south hardly disturbed his production. He led 
the league in assists for the 10th consecutive year and won his ninth MVP 
trophy. 
</P>
<P>
He is the only player in history to score 200 points in a season, a plateau he 
has reached four times. He set the record for goals with 92 in 1981-82, and 
then set the record for assists with 163 in 1985-86. During the 1983-84 season, 
he scored at least one point in an incredible 51 consecutive games. In the 
decade of the '80s, he was the NHL's MVP nine times and the scoring champion 
eight times. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder the Soviets were looking for rockets on his skates.

DRIVER OF MARTIN PICKUP LEGALLY DRUNK, TEST SHOWS

<P>
A blood alcohol test on the man blamed for the traffic accident in which former 
New York Yankee Manager Billy Martin died shows he was intoxicated according to 
legal definition, a prosecutor said today. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Guyette, who prosecutes felony drunk driving cases in the Broome County 
district attorney's office, said the test on William Reedy supports the charge 
that Reedy was drunk Christmas evening when he drove Martin's pickup truck off 
the road near Martin's rural home. 
</P>
<P>
Guyette refused to say what Reedy's blood-alcohol level was, but he said Reedy 
was charged under the state law that says a person is intoxicated when his 
blood-alcohol level is at least 0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Conviction on the misdemeanor charge carries a maximum penalty of a year in 
jail and a $1,000 fine. Reedy, who remained in fair condition today at 
University Hospital in Syracuse, faces arraignment Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Jon S. Blechman, Reedy's Binghamton lawyer, was not in his office and could not 
be reached for comment, his secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old Reedy, of Detroit, told a sheriff's deputy that he and Martin, 
61, had been out shopping and had stopped for a drink at a Binghamton bar, 
whose name he did not know, before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Broome County Sheriff Anthony Ruffo said his investigators had not discovered 
which bar it was but said it would not have much bearing on the case. 
</P>
<P>
State records in Michigan showed that Reedy was convicted in 1987 of driving 
while impaired after police in Dearborn, a Detroit suburb, reported his 
blood-alcohol level at more than 0.07%. 
</P>
<P>
His license was restricted for three months and he was ordered to attend 
outpatient alcohol treatment classes, said Denise Yockey, spokeswoman for the 
Michigan Secretary of State's office. 
</P>
<P>
Reedy, owner of Reedy's Saloon near Detroit's Tiger Stadium, also had five 
driving infractions in Michigan, including careless driving, making an improper 
turn and speeding.

FLORIDA ROMANIANS DEMONSTRATE LITTLE SYMPATHY FOR NADIA 
</P>

<P>
The trail got cold just two weeks and a few miles from here. But if Nadia 
Comaneci fell off the end of the earth tomorrow, it wouldn't be soon enough or 
too far away for some people. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Panait for one. Her husband, Constantin, ran off with the recently 
arrived Olympic vixen, leaving behind four young children, two vans, no money 
and who knows how many headaches. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought at least he would call for Christmas," she said Tuesday, "but no." 
</P>
<P>
The tall palms on the narrow street sway gently as she struggles to push a 
vacuum cleaner across the front seat of an aging Buick parked in the middle of 
the front lawn. Two of her three daughters crisscross the grass pushing new 
toys. 
</P>
<P>
She is angry. Constantin, a self-employed roofer, left for Romania Nov. 2 to 
visit his sick mother. The next time she saw him, he was standing next to Nadia 
at a news conference in New York. Maria actually believed that he was her 
manager and, as soon as she turned off the TV set, she began preparing a guest 
room in their modest home for the woman she thought would be their exalted 
guest. 
</P>
<P>
"He called me once and that was it. If he has called friends, friends of his, 
they wouldn't contact me. And so I have no idea where they are. And," she 
added, "I wouldn't even know where to begin looking." 
</P>
<P>
Sightings of the couple since they checked out of a Pompano Beach hotel and 
bought a flashy black Chevy convertible for $20,000 in cash would make Elvis 
green with envy. In Nadia's short stay in the United States, she has already 
become a master of the disinformation campaign. 
</P>
<P>
They were lovers, they were not, they were misunderstood. They were Mr. and 
Mrs. Michael Sweeney, or so they told the clerk in Pompano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
They were in Disney World in nearby Orlando. Or maybe they left the state for 
New York. Or Cleveland. Or. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I heard West Palm Beach from one member of my congregation," said Father 
Traian Pedrescu, pastor of Holy Trinity Romanian Orthodox Church in neighboring 
Miramar, a gathering place for many of the estimated 5,000 Romanians who have 
settled in south Florida. "Another told me they are staying at hotels around 
here, moving every two or three days to stay free from reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"But honestly," he continued, "with what is happening now in our country, most 
of them would say, 'Who cares?' Oh, when we first heard on TV she was coming, 
the Romanian people were very, very excited. Fifteen of us went to the airport 
to welcome her but we could not get near her. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, after this shameful thing -- the woman has four children and here, Nadia 
can meet lots of rich men -- we made prayers in our church that they would 
change," he continued. "That God would change their minds and they would change 
their ways." 
</P>
<P>
"But now, we are ashamed for her," he said, "and we must pray for bigger 
things." 
</P>
<P>
A television set behind Pedrescu brings the day's news from Romania into the 
rectory, at the same time casting a luminous glow on his white hair. He fingers 
a pair of eyeglasses and tries to explain the distinctly Romanian concept of 
pocainta, which translates loosely to the English penitence. 
</P>
<P>
"A sinner will be received every time in church, so long as they are sorry for 
what they did. But she said, 'There is not sexual relations between us.' Is not 
possible," he said, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Panaits and their children were in his church a number of times, 
Pedrescu clung to the slim hope that he might be able to speak with Constantin 
or Nadia or both in person. He no longer harbors any illusions. 
</P>
<P>
"If my English were better," he said, "I would write an article and say: 
'Nadia, wake up. You are losing much love and much money. You are going the 
wrong way.' " 
</P>
<P>
Mike Jacki, executive director of the U.S. Gymnastics Federation, is less 
emotional but equally puzzled. In the days after Nadia's harrowing escape 
across the Romanian border into Hungary last month, the federation received 
more than a dozen offers for movies, books and personal appearances from 
corporations and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm almost willing to bet that to this day, she doesn't know a thing about 
them," he said. "We could never reach her to tell her, so we put it out through 
the media. The next day, Mr. Panait called and said to put them in the mail to 
him. I said no way. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the only contact we've had from either of them." 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Bela Karolyi, Nadia's original coach who has since defected and 
opened a gym in Houston, and Jacki concluded that they weren't on the couple's 
mailing list either. They jointly released a statement, in effect saying best 
wishes and call if you regain your senses. 
</P>
<P>
Nadia was a 14-year-old picture of perfection in the 1976 Olympic Games. She is 
regarded now as a rouged home-wrecker by most of her countrymen along the quiet 
streets in Hallandale and Hollywood where she would have been a hero. The irony 
is that she appears to be the only one for whom the picture is still out of 
focus. 
</P>
<P>
"People who abandon their sport or their profession or whatever it is that 
brings them to the kind of pinnacle Nadia reached usually do one of two 
things," Jacki said. "Either they eat a big slice of humble pie or they wind up 
working at a carwash. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll run into Nadia at a gymnastics meet in the future," he added. 
"That's if she can afford the price of a ticket."

CAP Scores/CAP Scores Ranking 
</P>
<P>
The California Assessment Program (CAP) is the statewide testing program that 
provides information on the academic achievement of students in public schools 
for grades 3, 6, 8, and 12. Only two years of data are available because a new 
grade 12 test was administered in 1988. The relative percentile rank compares a 
school's performance with that of similar schools. The statewide rank expresses 
how a school performs in comparison with all other schools in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Course Enrollments 
</P>
<P>
Enrollments in advanced courses are viewed as an indicator of academic rigor 
for high schools. The reported figures reflect enrollments among 11th- and 
12th-graders in advanced math (geometry, calculus and trigonometry) and 
advanced science (all science courses certified by UC as meeting the "a-f" 
requirements, such as biology, zoology, advanced physics (see UC Required 
Courses below)). 
</P>
<P>
For chemistry and physics, the percentage of seniors enrolled is reported. The 
(+) or (-) symbol indicates whether the enrollments in these courses have 
increased or decreased since 1983-84. For fine arts and foreign language 
enrollments, the (+) or (-) indicates an increase or decrease in senior 
enrollments since last year only. 
</P>
<P>
Dropout Rate 
</P>
<P>
This figure represents the overall dropout rate for grades 10,11 and 12 
combined that the school experienced during 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
A dropout is defined as any student who has been enrolled in grade 10, 11 or 12 
but who left school before graduation or completion of a formal education, or 
legal equivalent, and who did not within 45 school days enter another public or 
private educational institution. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance Rate 
</P>
<P>
The rate reported is the actual yearly pupil attendance rate as disclosed 
annually by local boards of education. The statewide percentile rank is also 
reported. The 1987-88 statewide value is 91.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) 
</P>
<P>
The SAT includes a verbal section and a math section, each of which is scored 
on a scale of 200 to 800. In California, 450 verbal and 500 math are considered 
average scores; higher scores are achieved by those students doing well on the 
test. 
</P>
<P>
For comparative purposes, the SAT data is reported for 1984 and 1988. Included 
are the percentage of seniors taking the test; the average verbal score, and 
the percentage scoring 450 and above; and the average math score and the 
percentage of seniors scoring 500 and above. 
</P>
<P>
Advanced Placement 
</P>
<P>
The Advanced Placement (AP) exams are given in 24 academic subject areas, such 
as biology, physics, French, calculus, music theory and computer science. 
Students who pass these rigorous tests (by obtaining a score of 3 or better, on 
a scale of 1 to 5) receive college credit. The figures reported are the 
percentage of tests passed, per 100 seniors, for 1984 and 1988, and the average 
score for all tests taken at the school for those years. 
</P>
<P>
UC Required Courses 
</P>
<P>
School principals report the number of graduates who complete the courses 
accepted by the University of California as requirements for admission, known 
as the "a-f" requirements. The courses include U.S. history, four years of 
English, three years of math, a laboratory science, two years of foreign 
language and elective courses. The statistic reported is the percentage of 1986 
and 1988 graduates who completed the a-f course sequence. 
</P>
<P>
Public University Attendance 
</P>
<P>
Figures reported here are college attendance rates for the University of 
California (UC) and the California State University (CSU) for the graduates of 
1986 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Extracurricular Activities 
</P>
<P>
Figures reported are the percentages of students who report that they are 
enrolled in one or more extracurricular activities and those enrolled in 
non-sports extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
Student Ethnicity 
</P>
<P>
The ethnic breakdown of the school population is reported and compared with 
enrollments in advanced mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
Teacher Background 
</P>
<P>
Figures reported are the average years of service for the teachers at the 
school and the percentage of teachers having a master's degree or a doctorate. 
</P>
<P>
Parent Education 
</P>
<P>
Parent education level is used as an indicator of socioeconomic status. The 
first three statistics show the percentage of students at the school whose 
parents have attained certain educational levels. 
</P>
<P>
The statewide percentile rank shows where the overall parent education level at 
the school ranks among all other schools with a grade 12.
