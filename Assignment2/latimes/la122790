Tartuffles, 2145 W. Chapman Ave., Orange. Open daily, 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. (714) 
541-0053. Two words: cinnamon rolls. Hot out of the oven and smothered in 
butter. 
</P>
<P>
Plus full breakfast plates, an outdoor patio and great service. Need we say 
more? 
</P>
<P>
Casa Franco, 24395 Alicia Parkway, Mission Viejo. Open Monday through Friday, 
11 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. (Note: sometimes closes 
between 2:30 and 4:30 p.m.) (714) 380-9693. A little family-owned Mexican 
restaurant where even the owners wait tables. Try the nachos a la Franco, carne 
asada and chimiflautas, then, if you still have room, go for a slice of mud 
pie. 
</P>
<P>
Zubie's Pizza, 1714 Placentia Ave., Costa Mesa. Open 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
Monday through Saturday and Sunday 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. (No phone.) The pizzas 
here come in one size only -- large -- and one price only -- $6.50 plus tax. 
That's whether you order plain, the works or any range of toppings in between. 
Expect picnic tables, a varied crowd and lots of noise, but you want decorum or 
you want good, cheap pizza? LANA HAYS

Salerno, 220 Beach St., Laguna Beach. Open 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Wednesday 
through Monday. (714) 497-2600. Owner Tony Manzi's accent is nearly as thick as 
his meat sauce, and his menu is just as hearty. 
</P>
<P>
Try the gnocchi, baked mostaccoli with Italian sausage or, if you happen to be 
dining with understanding friends, the fettuccine with garlic and oil. 
</P>
<P>
Las Barcas Mexican Restaurant, 21032 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. Open daily, 
11 a.m. to 9 p.m. (714) 536-2616. Oversize portions, the hodgepodge decor and a 
colorful variety of local folk make this tiny eatery a beachside winner. The 
food is good and cheap, featuring ranchero sauce-covered burritos, fresh 
snapper tacos and homemade tortilla chips. Be prepared to take out, though, as 
there's always a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Sonic Drive-In, 15640 Brookhurst St., Westminster, and 1632 N. Lemon St., 
Anaheim. Both open Sunday through Thursday, 10 a.m. to midnight; Friday and 
Saturday till 1 a.m. (714) 531-8000. Nearly every aspect of this drive-in is 
perfect. From the Texas-size drinks (even the straws are big) to the 
bodaciously hot-to-handle onion rings and juicy hickory burgers. Pull in 
underneath the turquoise-and-white canopy, park next to a squawk box and order 
up. APRIL JACKSON

Ristorante Genovese, 214 N. Tustin Ave., Orange. Open Tuesday through Friday 
for lunch, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Tuesday through Saturday for dinner, 5 to 10 p.m. 
(714) 633-5654. 
</P>

A family-run restaurant that's intimate yet casual, classy yet reasonable, and 
serves deep red, rich, garlic-laden sauce straight from the soul of Sicily. 
Pasta dishes are popular, and the steak a la Sicilian is extraordinary. But no 
place is perfect. It's closed Sunday and Monday.JIM COLONNA

Petite France, 1835 Newport Blvd., Suite D-156, Costa Mesa. Open daily, except 
Sunday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. (714) 650-9363. 
</P>
<P>
About the only hints that this storefront stand is a low-budget operation are 
the foam serving trays and plastic utensils. The quality of the food -- from 
beef Bourguignon in red wine sauce to prawns sauteed with cilantro -- is light 
years beyond the nearest Happy Star. Yet most entrees are under $5. RANDY LEWIS

Henry N' Harry's Goat Hill Tavern, 1830 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Open daily from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. (714) 548-8428. This place serves no fewer 
than 96 brands of tap beer; the keg room looks like Jerry Lee Lewis' idea of a 
well-stocked bomb shelter. The tavern proper consists of several rooms, packed 
with games and decorated with everything from buffalo heads to Elvis dolls. 
Best of all, there are, to quote a regular, "people from all over the world 
here, all kinds, slobs and business people, and they let it all down." JIM

The Rose &amp; Crown British Pub, 647 Camino de los Mares, San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Open daily 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. (714) 240-2392. This is not a place for a quick 
drink. If the Queen's English conversation doesn't make you want to linger, the 
British brews and the salt and vinegar crisps will. A favorite pastime here is 
darts. The pub's in a bit of an unlikely spot, so watch for the red 
double-decker bus parked in the field next door. AMY McCURDY

The Blue Beet Cafe, 107 21st St., Newport Beach. Open daily, 11:30 to 2 a.m. 
(714) 675-2338. Tucked into an alley between storefronts facing the Newport 
Pier, this bar isn't the easiest to find. But its friendly, good cheer makes it 
worth the search. Patrons are mainly young and single, and there's usually a 
guy in the back room playing the guitar. 
</P>
<P>
Dillman's, 801 E. Balboa Blvd., Newport Beach. Open daily 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. 
(714) 673-7726. A noble place, resolutely unfashionable, Dillman's satisfies 
the most important requirements of the serious bar-goer: Keep it dark, keep it 
quiet and keep 'em coming. 
</P>
<P>
The Harp Inn, 130 17th St., Costa Mesa. (714) 646-8855. A bar without pretense 
for people who'd rather get poked in the eye than take a drink in some place 
like Irvine. They have OK Irish music here on the weekends; occasionally an 
exuberant patron takes the stage about closing time to work out on a Celtic 
folk song or two. Plus which, they put out a happy hour spread of Ritz crackers 
and tuna fish. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Landing, 503 E. Edgewater Ave., Newport Beach. Open daily till 2 a.m., 
Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m., Saturdays from 8 a.m., Sundays from 9 
a.m. (714) 675-2373. It's on the glitzy side, it tends to be crowded, the 
waitresses are a trifle slow and the drinks ain't cheap. But there's a great 
view of the harbor and the ferries that makes it all worthwhile. A fine place 
to park yourself on a Sunday afternoon. The Village Inn, 127 Marine Ave., 
Balboa Island. Open Monday through Friday from 6:30 a.m. to 2 a.m., Saturday 
and Sunday from 7 a.m. (714) 675-8300. People here tend to be a little older 
than the kids you find thronging many beachside bars. The atmosphere's 
informal, friendly and real. And the fireplace and couches in the corner make 
it just perfect for winter nights. Live music nightly.MIKE FLAGG

Vern's Cornhusker Club and Suds Pub, 645 S. State College Blvd., Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Open daily 9 a.m. to 1 a.m. (714) 526-5428. Pitchers of beer, shoestring 
potatoes, pool and a juke that gives you three for a quarter. Don't bother 
changing out of your work shirt.

The Tropicana Bar and Grill, 610 Avenida Victoria (across from the San Clemente 
Municipal Pier), San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Open Sundays through Thursdays till 11, Fridays and Saturdays till midnight. 
(714) 498-TROP. A yuppie joint with charm. Sit leisurely under the thatched 
roof and sip tropical drinks while viewing the pier and surfers below. The most 
memorable feature, though, is found in the ladies room: a mural of Tarzan that 
lets out a yell in the bar when you pull down the Ape Man's loincloth.JAMES M.

10:30, Tuesdays through Thursdays till 11, and Fridays and Saturdays till 
midnight. (714) 553-1333. Frazzled after a day on the fast track? Try a glass 
of Chianti Classico or a Sambuca Romana at Prego: It may be the best 
yuppie/muppie (for middle-aged) bar around here. On warm summer nights you can 
sit outside on the patio, where there's jazz on Thursdays and Fridays and 
chamber music on Saturdays, starting at 6:30 p.m. CLAUDIA LUTHER

Cocktail lounges are made for tete-a-tetes with your sweetie, or for solo 
imbibing when you want to be serene and contemplative. They should have low 
lights, a low ceiling, intimate seating and lots of stuff to absorb sound and 
keep hushed conversations hushed. This one may be the coziest of the cozy. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Jost's, 2803 E. Anaheim St., Long Beach. Open Monday through Saturday 10 
a.m. to 11 p.m., Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (213) 439-5446. In the early 1920s it 
was a barbershop, serving root beer and sandwiches to waiting customers. When 
Prohibition ended, the health department said either serve food and beer or cut 
hair. The beer still comes in frosted 20-ounce schooners, the eggs are pickled 
on the premises, there's pool and snooker in the back room, and freshly roasted 
peanuts and cigars are sold behind the bar. PATRICK MOTT

</P>
<P>
Open weekdays from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. and weekends from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. (714) 
779-0880. Anchored in a strip mall, this may well be the "last of the 
neighborhood saloons," as management claims. There's lots of wood, a jukebox 
heavy on classic rock, and help that knows the regulars -- from suits to 
shirt-sleeves types -- by name. RICK VANDERKNYFF

"Picnic at Hanging Rock" (1975), directed by Peter Weir. 115 minutes. Rated R. 
An early gem from the director of "Dead Poets Society" and "Witness," this one 
is set in 1900 Australia, where three girls and their teacher vanish while on a 
school outing. 
</P>
<P>
A psychedelic-supernatural story supposedly based on an actual account. 
</P>
<P>
"Miracle Mile" (1989), directed by Steve DeJarnatt. 87 minutes. Rated R. Among 
the best of the nuclear apocalyptic films, the mood of this one resembles that 
of the quirky "After Midnight." A man races against time after mistakenly 
receiving a message that missiles have been launched and World War III is an 
hour away. Intense, humorous and powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Haunting" (1963), directed by Robert Wise. 112 minutes. No rating. This 
ghost story will give you sweaty palms, high blood pressure, just about 
everything a scary movie should, without benefit of fake decapitations and 
gallons of fake blood -- just a plot, some chilling sound effects and superb 
black-and-white photography. Not to mention a cast headed by Julie Harris and 
Claire Bloom. ERIK HAMILTON

"Harvey" (1950), directed by Henry Koster. 104 minutes. No rating. Elwood P. 
Dowd's best friend is a 6-foot-tall rabbit named Harvey that no one else can 
see. 
</P>
<P>
Is he crazy? Not as crazy as those of us who overlook the wondrous because 
we're too focused on the mundane. 
</P>
<P>
"The Crimson Pirate" (1952), directed by Robert Siodmak. 104 minutes. No 
rating. A spoof of all those Errol Flynn pirate movies. The pirates say 
"Arrrgh!" a lot and tend to get their peg-legs stuck in the grills over the 
hatches. And this time it's Burt Lancaster who gets to be gallant as hell. 
</P>
<P>
"The Third Man" (1949), directed by Carol Reed. 100 minutes. No rating. An 
American comes to postwar Vienna to discover a friend has been murdered, and he 
winds up learning a little about love and loyalty -- too late, alas, to help 
himself. With Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, a script by Graham Greene that is a 
marvel of wit and intelligence, and some great zither music.MIKE FLAGG

"Hope and Glory" (1987), directed by John Boorman. 113 minutes. Rated PG-13. 
War from the perspective of an awe-struck youth, a 7-year-old London boy 
roaming like a terrier, sniffing out fresh shrapnel to add to his collection, 
escaping his basement shelter to see the bombs exploding -- the best fireworks 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Boorman never turns war into something flip or trivial. 
</P>
<P>
"Things Change" (1988), directed by David Mamet. 100 minutes. Rated R. An 
Italian shoemaker (Don Ameche) agrees to take the rap for a mob hit, but gets 
one last fling with the low-level Mafioso (Joe Mantegna) assigned to protect 
him. It's a comic tarantella with a soft-shoe style, and lots of little moments 
that make up for sentimental excesses. 
</P>
<P>
"The Thing" (1951), directed by Christian Nyby. 87 minutes. No rating. Among 
the first in a spate of '50s sci-fi films, this black-and-white movie is said 
to have inspired many contemporary filmmakers and movies. It's intentionally 
spare and direct, but there's wit in the script: the alien turns out to be a 
vegetable, of all things. 
</P>
<P>
"Vampire's Kiss" (1989), directed by Robert Bierman. 96 minutes. Rated R. A 
contemporary spin on the vampire fantasy, with Nicolas Cage as a neurotic New 
Yorker who thinks a one-night stand (Jennifer Beals) has turned him into 
Dracula. May be too offbeat for devoted horror fans, but this clever, 
cartoon-ish metaphor has bite.MARK CHALON SMITH

"Smithereens" (1982), directed by Susan Seidelman. 90 minutes. No rating. In 
the spirit of the punk movement that inspired it, this film spews raw 
spontaneity, stars a mostly non-professional cast and looks as though it were 
made for a few thousand dollars. It focuses on Wren, a hyper, 
just-out-of-high-school Jersey girl trying to be a part of the New York punk 
scene, and a band called the Smithereens (a name used later by a real-life pop 
band). 
</P>
<P>
"Smile" (1975), directed by Michael Ritchie. 113 minutes. Rated PG. One of a 
series of Michael Ritchie films about America's unbending faith in traditions 
and pageantry, no matter how tarnished. In this one, it's a beauty pageant that 
takes it on the chin. Look for an 18-year-old Melanie Griffith as one of the 
contestants. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pajama Game" (1957), directed by Stanley Donen and George Abbott. 101 
minutes. No rating. The plot is frivolous and obvious, the acting hammy, and 
much of the dialogue outright dumb, but who cares? This musical, starring Doris 
Day and John Raitt, is buoyed by Richard Adler/Jerry Ross songs and Bob Fosse 
choreography. And it's good clean American fun. -- D.L. 
</P>
<P>
"Moonlighting" (1982), directed by Jerzy Skolimowski. 97 minutes. Rated PG. An 
unforgettable story of four Polish construction workers sent to London to 
renovate the foreign getaway of their wealthy boss. It's comical, touching, 
newsy and political -- a heartfelt tale of workingmen's values and Western 
consumerism. 
</P>
<P>
"Heart Beat" (1980), directed by John Byrum. 109 minutes. Rated R. This 
character study of Beat Generation legends Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady and 
the woman they both loved is an enjoyable piece of nostalgia, a kind of '50s 
version of "Easy Rider." It stars Nick Nolte, John Heard and Sissy Spacek. 
</P>
<P>
"Cutter's Way" (1981), directed by Ivan Passer. 109 minutes. Rated R. The story 
of a crippled veteran, his best friend and their efforts to solve a murder. 
It's one of the best introspective character studies in years, a welcome island 
of reality in Hollywood's sea of fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
"Orphans" (1987), directed by Alan J. Pakula. 120 minutes. Rated R. Albert 
Finney plays a blustery Chicago gangster who is abducted by a crazed third-rate 
thief and held in the dilapidated house the thief shares with his backward 
younger brother. With Midwestern gangster slang and alcohol-tainted good 
manners, Finney parodies both American films and American values, uproariously. 
</P>
<P>
"The Killing" (1956), directed by Stanley Kubrick. 83 minutes. No rating. Very 
serious thugs plan the biggest score of their careers. An urgent, no-nonsense, 
unrelenting film by the man who went on to direct "Dr. Strangelove," "2001: A 
Space Odyssey" and "A Clockwork Orange." DOUG LIST

PRITIKIN CHINESE? A LITTLE 'DIET' OIL GOES A LONG WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mandarin Pritikin. I had to blink when I saw the sign. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that the combination is necessarily implausible. The idea just takes a 
little getting used to, because anyone familiar with the Pritikin program for 
weight reduction and cardiovascular maintenance knows about its low-fat, 
low-salt and (let's be honest) low-sensory-threshold approach to eating. 
Chinese restaurant food, though, tends to be oily, salty and wonderfully tasty. 
</P>
<P>
These twain meet at a place called the Cathay Newport. It really would be 
nothing more than just another chic, modern Chinese restaurant were it not for 
the eccentric inclusion of several dishes steamed without oil, starch, sugar or 
salt. (I have to congratulate the owners on this brilliant marketing stroke -- 
who can afford oil these days?) 
</P>
<P>
Still, it is a tastefully designed place, a cavernous room with a swank bar 
nestled into one corner and comfy booths to sink into. There are three huge 
Chinese paintings dominating their respective walls, and the pastel green and 
beige color scheme relaxes you from the moment you enter. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's that section of the menu: "Pritikin menu for the health 
conscious." Each of the dishes' names there begins with the word dieter's and 
ends with the word delight (except for one called "Cathay special"). 
Unfortunately, dieter's delight sounds like a self-contradictory phrase and, 
also unfortunately, that impression is not dispelled here. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that any of these dishes is bad. Quite the contrary. Most of these 
meats and vegetables have a fresh, clean taste and are in fact preferable to a 
lot of the Americanized fare the restaurant insists on serving non-Pritikin 
diners. 
</P>
<P>
But this is only the case after they have been doused in a good-tasting garlic 
sauce that the management craftily brings on the side. Small detail. Of course, 
this is tantamount to ordering a low-fat yogurt brownie sundae, you know, the 
one with the hot fudge cascading down the sides. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, after sampling a couple of Pritikin dishes, I wanted to sample the rest 
of the menu and made the mistake of asking our waitress to do most of the 
ordering. I told her we wanted some real Chinese dishes -- "none of that 
Westernized stuff" -- but what we got was the po po platter: limp, tepid, 
meatless egg rolls; batter-fried shrimp I could have sworn were Mrs. Paul's, 
and three retro-style barbecued spareribs roughly the color of Madonna's 
lipstick. 
</P>
<P>
Hold it right there, we said. We'll order for ourselves now, if it isn't too 
late. Things improved dramatically. First we had a plateful of steamed won ton, 
10 to an order, in hot pepper sauce. The won ton were cooked al dente and 
tasted like an exotic version of Italian pasta in its fiery sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the first of the main courses, filet of fish in a light wine sauce, 
which turned out to be the best dish of the evening. The fish (rock cod that 
day) had been lightly battered and drizzled with rice wine and minced garlic. 
Brought out on a sizzling platter, it was flaky and sweet, with just the 
slightest hint of pungency. 
</P>
<P>
After that, we sort of let ourselves get carried away. The maitre d' suggested 
an off-menu special, an absolutely marvelous combination of scallops and fresh 
asparagus. It came in an egg white-based sauce that is called "velvet" on a 
great many Chinese menus, but not this one. 
</P>
<P>
He also insisted we try the lobster in black bean sauce, a Cantonese-type dish 
consisting of a mountain of shelled lobster meat peering out from under its 
onetime shell. The salty, fermented soy bean is a natural complement to the 
silky sweetness of lobster, and this is one of the most satisfying dishes in 
the Chinese repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by now, we decided to make it a full-fledged banquet. So we finished 
up with crisp duckling, Peking style, and a sumptuous noodle dish with chicken. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps because we'd ordered so many dishes, the maitre d' was nice enough to 
wrap slices of deep-fried duckling and scallion in a rice flour crepe, then 
smear the whole mixture with plum sauce. But good intentions do not a delicacy 
make. The duck was sodden with grease. It actually soaked right through the 
crepe. 
</P>
<P>
The point to all of this, I suppose, is that Cathay Newport can be a pretty 
good restaurant, provided you know what to order. It's best to avoid the 
deep-fried dishes, anything fried with batter and any Westernized combinations 
(that is, dishes that mingle meats with seafoods or list more than three main 
ingredients). 
</P>
<P>
The vegetable, noodle and rice dishes are generally sound. Both spicy bean curd 
and hot spiced eggplant are delightful, and the noodle and rice dishes are 
fresh and made with a minimum of oil. 
</P>
<P>
Which is not the same as no oil at all. I'd be the first to admit the health 
benefits of Pritikin cuisine, and I applaud this restaurant's efforts in making 
it available. Just make sure I get a little oil, salt and sugar to go along 
with my food here. Then I'll be happy to eat as much of it as my doctor 
advises. 
</P>
<P>
Cathay Newport is moderately priced. Hot appetizers are $3.50 to $12.75. Soups 
are $4.75 and $4.95. Noodle and rice dishes are $5.75 to $9.50. Cathay 
specialties are $9.95 to $29.50. Pritikin dishes are $10.25 to $16.50. The 
lunch menu, served until 3 p.m., is considerably lower in price.

Just in time for New Year's, the Main Street Bar and Grill is open in the 
Pierside Pavilion at Huntington Beach. Located on the second floor, the 
restaurant offers plenty of terrace seating and stunning sunset views. There's 
a contemporary grill ambience with marble floors, granite tables and an 
exhibition kitchen with counter seating. The eclectic menu ranges from 
appetizers, soups, salads and sandwiches to seafood and other main courses. And 
because the menu is served all day, you can have a dinner entree at noon or a 
salad in the evening. A la carte prices range from $6.95 for a salad to $29.95 
for a certified Black Angus steak (the average price is about $15). Open daily 
for lunch, dinner and late supper at Main Street and Pacific Coast Highway. 
(714) 840-6518. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Maxwell's, just across PCH, remains open during the removal of the 
Huntington Beach Pier; it, too, offers a grandstand view. (714) 536-2555. 
</P>
<P>
Splashes has made a splash right on the beach at the Surf and Sand Hotel in 
Laguna Beach. Less expensive and more casual (but no beachwear, please) than 
the hotel's glamorous Towers restaurant, Splashes accents contemporary 
Mediterranean cuisine. The a la carte menu includes such starters as shrimp and 
mushrooms wrapped in phyllo crust with arugula salad. Entrees include roast 
lamb with vegetable tart and tomato-coriander sauce, roast striped bass with 
fennel, and grilled rib-eye steak with Banyuls (a sweet fortified wine) sauce. 
There are 40 wines from the smaller wineries of Italy, France and California. 
Currently open nightly for dinner, Splashes will soon add breakfast and lunch. 
1555 S. Coast Highway, Laguna Beach. (714) 497-4477.

The popular Kim Wu, former chef at the now-defunct La Chinoise in Lake Forest, 
is now chef at Fortune in South Coast Plaza Village, Santa Ana. Does this mean 
we can go into Fortune and order Peking duck without giving 24 hours' notice, 
as we did in the old days at Wu's Peking Duck restaurant in Orange? 
"Absolutely," he says. Reservations: (714) 850-9008. 
</P>
<P>
Here's consolation for devotees who miss Showley-Wrightson, which closed in 
Newport Beach last spring. Your favorite S-W salads now are available at Sgt. 
Pepperoni's Pizza Store in Newport Beach. Sgt. Pep's gourmand owners, Eastbluff 
residents Dave and Vivian Patterson, were fans and friends of the Showleys and 
they enticed Delia Hernandez, who made S-W's salads for nine years, to join 
them. Four different salads are available daily from a repertoire of 11 
(examples: Thai chicken salad, lemon basil pasta, Tex Mex potato) by the scoop 
or by the pound. Or order a deli salad platter -- your choice of any three for 
$5.45. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, the Pattersons (who recently sold their Irvine and Tustin stores 
to concentrate on the Newport location) also have introduced "California-style" 
pizzas to the restaurant: Thai chicken, goat cheese and Gorgonzola/walnut, to 
name a few. 2300 Bristol St. (714) 852-9500. BEVERLY BUSH SMITH

<P>
Before it's too late, Dr. Richard Handwerger of Beverly Hills wants to remind 
you of one of the less-publicized New Year's Eve hazards: 
</P>
<P>
A flying champagne cork. 
</P>
<P>
It's "like a small, guided missile," says Handwerger, an ophthalmologist. 
</P>
<P>
So, as a public service, we're sure, he's holding a press conference today to 
stage "a spectacular demonstration of how damaging a flying cork can be" and to 
outline the "three steps to safely open a bottle of champagne." 
</P>
<P>
Step No. 1: Never let that brother-in-law of yours open it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Getting a jump on the competition: J.C. Penney stores began what they described 
as their "after-Christmas sale" on Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
But . . . you say you're all shopped out? Here's some inspiration: Nordstrom is 
selling a special Christmas edition compact disc featuring the piano players 
who perform in their stores, complete with photos. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Christmas is over, it's not too late to see the holiday displays in 
Beverly Hills, which comprise more than 491,860 lights. (Energy crisis? What 
energy crisis?) 
</P>
<P>
The city's own lighting extravaganza, according to its publicist, the Donahue 
Group, "required the use of so much tubular lighting that the entire U.S. 
supply was diminished and orders needed to be sent around the world to complete 
the job." 
</P>
<P>
It includes 10 decorations, described as "Dickensian scenes of winter," hung 
above Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Funny, but somehow we never associated Charles Dickens with Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
It's unfortunate timing for those "California Cool" lottery ads that show a 
December surfer and declare: 
</P>
<P>
"It's another California winter -- sort of hard to tell from a California 
summer." 
</P>
<P>
No, not really. 
</P>
<P>
While there's nothing new on the fate of the Elvis Head float, rumored to be 
headed this way from its home in Jackson, Miss., we bring you this related 
bulletin from the Richard M. Nixon Library and Birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
The gift shop's second-most popular postcard is one of the then-President 
shaking hands with the (forever) King in the Oval Office. That card ranks right 
behind a shot of Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Bush together at the 
library dedication earlier this year. Jimmy Carter didn't show up for the gala, 
nor did Elvis, as far as we know. 
</P>
<P>
Our recent mention of the dirt-floor accommodations at L.A.'s first hotel, the 
Bella Union, inspired historian Bill Murphy to recall a spectacular gunfight 
there. 
</P>
<P>
It seems that wealthy rancher Robert Carlisle had slashed the hand of 
undersheriff Andrew King at a wedding at the hotel in 1865. The next day, 
King's brothers, Sam and Frank, ambushed the rancher in the street outside. 
</P>
<P>
Carlisle was able to wound Sam and kill Frank, but was himself hit four times. 
</P>
<P>
The rancher "was carried inside and laid on the billiard table, where he died," 
Murphy wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many L.A. landmarks, the Bella Union is gone. But the site attracted 
notoriety a decade ago when the city paid an artist almost $1 million to create 
the Triforium, a largely ignored musical sculpture, in what is now the City 
Mall on Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
Only in L.A. Menu Item of the Week -- at the Inn of the Seventh Ray in Topanga 
Canyon: 
</P>
<P>
"Five Secret Rays -- A ring of lightly steamed vegetable gems surrounding a 
mound of herbed brown organic rice." 
</P>
<P>
It's the top item on the menu, which notes that "entrees are listed in order of 
their esoteric vibrational value for your experimentation." 
</P>
<P>
Be careful of the champagne bottles, too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
L.A. County averaged just under four bank robberies per business day this year.

But it's not a pay-back for their support of the gulf policy. Who's kidding

U.S. AID TO THE SOVIET UNION

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's support of the $1-billion credits to aid the Soviet Union is 
nothing less than support for a Communist dictatorship and the Soviet empire 
created by aggression and maintained by a brutal force. It is clear who will 
benefit, especially when it was announced in advance that the KGB, whose hands 
are still red from the Georgian massacre, will be put in charge to administer 
such aid. 
</P>
<P>
What is the difference between Saddam Hussein who occupied Kuwait and Gorbachev 
who insists on continuing the occupation of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia? Both 
of them claim that these small countries are part of their empires. Both of 
them have their tanks and their armies in the occupied areas, yet we are 
willing to spill our blood to depose one and our tax dollars to save the other, 
all in the name of international law and American interest. 
</P>
<P>
Since it is customary to acknowledge people for accomplishments at the end of 
the year, I would like to nominate President Bush for two awards. First, for 
the Hero of Soviet Union, which he is trying to save at any cost. The second, a 
membership in the Pallbearers of Lithuania's Independence.

PROTESTS AGAINST GULF ACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Ruth Rosen's "A Grass-Roots War Resistance Is Blossoming" 
(Commentary, Dec. 13): 
</P>
<P>
I want to support the idea that the spontaneous grass-roots opposition to 
potential war in the gulf is comprised mainly of ordinary citizens, not 
radicals. The East San Gabriel Valley, where I teach, has long been identified 
with conservative politics. 
</P>
<P>
Yet resistance to war is strong in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, at Citrus College in Glendora, I am the faculty sponsor for 61 
Students for Peace in the Middle East. In the group are army reservists, 
citizens born in the Middle East, potential draft resisters, mothers of 
draft-age sons and several self-described "super patriots." This diverse group 
is only united by its common concern for peace. In just a few weeks this group 
has gathered signatures from 482 faculty and students on a peace petition. It 
reads, in part, ". . . we urge a peaceful resolution to the gulf crisis through 
economic sanctions and negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a grass-roots war resistance is blossoming and it is neither left or 
right in orientation.

THE UNITED STATES HAS HUGE STAKES IN HONG KONG AND MUST NOT BE STUCK IN A

<TEXT>
<P>
Like the Cheshire cat from "Alice in Wonderland," the British are fast 
disappearing from Hong Kong. Even now, six years before Hong Kong's handover to 
China in 1997, some people see only a lingering grin. 
</P>
<P>
The British are satisfied. Their surrender of the empire's last major colony to 
China is approaching with scarcely a raised eyebrow from the rest of the world. 
Success in the handing over of 6 million free people against their will, to a 
communist tyranny, while maintaining the approval of the Free World, shows 
British diplomacy at its most skillful. Even Tian An Men Square, that bloody 
showcase of unreformed communism, only slowed the process; everything is now 
back on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
But what about America's stand on Hong Kong? 
</P>
<P>
American and British interests, although they coincide in the Persian Gulf and 
in most parts of the world, diverge sharply in East Asia. This is because the 
British are on the way out, while the Americans are staying. As the region's 
policeman and guarantor of security from Japan to Australia, America has 
long-term commitments, while the British are mainly interested in a safe 
retreat. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. economic interests in the region are incomparably greater than Britain's. 
Even in British Hong Kong, America's economic stake far exceeds Britain's. 
There are more than 900 American companies, employing a quarter of a million 
people, 10% of the work force. Americans own 158 factories and have invested 
$1.4 billion in Hong Kong manufacturing, accounting for a third of all foreign 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the 14th largest U.S. export market, a major buyer of American 
high technology and among the top three markets for oranges, poultry and 
cigarettes. The American community, 20,000 strong, far outnumbers Britons. 
</P>
<P>
And of course Hong Kong is the gateway to China for American trade -- and 
American ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's stability is rightly an American concern. Yet the United States has 
been a bystander in Hong Kong's transition, with little to say since 1984, when 
it was the first to endorse the "one country, two systems" premise of the 
Sino-British joint declaration on Hong Kong's future. 
</P>
<P>
Deference to China and Britain became the rule -- to the point where U.S. 
consular staff were ordered to always sound optimistic on Hong Kong's future. 
This stance suited the interests of American businessmen but did nothing to 
advance America's nobler democratic ideals. U.S. policy on Hong Kong was not to 
have one. 
</P>
<P>
Tian An Men Square made American silence morally untenable. Hong Kong became a 
central factor in Sino-U.S. relations. When China's most-favored-nation status 
came up for renewal last June, U.S. legislators had to weigh their desire to 
punish China for its savagery against the economic interests of Hong Kong and 
of Americans there. 
</P>
<P>
To secure the recent U.N. Security Council ultimatum to Iraq, the United States 
felt compelled to reward China with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's Washington 
visit -- effectively ending its post-Tian An Men sanction against high-level 
contacts and arguably giving China a tactical edge. 
</P>
<P>
Qian wasted no time. He reasserted that human rights were an internal affair. 
And U.S. Ambassador to China James Lilley, like the monkey dancing to the 
organ-grinder, played into his hands. Lilley called students demonstrating in 
Seattle against China's repression of Tibet "cowards" and told them they should 
go back to China. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, there is much that cries out for American comment -- 
comment springing from the framework of a real policy. Key provisions in the 
1984 Sino-British joint declaration have been perverted or ignored in the Basic 
Law, which will govern Hong Kong come 1997. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, Britain has caved in whenever China disapproved, despite the 
misgivings of Hong Kong's more perceptive legislators. The longstanding promise 
of democratization has faded into a legislature with only one-third of its 
members to be directly elected in 1997 and only one-half in 2007. People under 
age 21 remain disfranchised. A fledgling bill of rights has been so diluted 
that it's meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
Only China's National Party Congress can amend and interpret the Basic Law. The 
list of controls goes on, giving the lie to Deng Xiaoping's "One country, two 
systems" formula. 
</P>
<P>
Britain can't wait to extricate itself. Lord Caithness, the minister 
responsible for Hong Kong, said as much when he pronounced that it is up to 
Hong Kong to revoke the statutory death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
China can't wait to step in. Its New China News Agency -- fractionally a news 
bureau but mostly a policy enforcement "embassy" -- muscles in on Hong Kong 
affairs regularly. Orderly Hong Kong demonstrations for democracy are 
considered subversive. Subversion can earn the death sentence in China; Lord 
Caithness' buck-passing carries treacherous implications. Hong Kong is not used 
to voting, thanks to 150 years of colonial rule, but, by the same token, it 
isn't used to having its protesters shot for holding a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Developments since 1984, and particularly since June 4, 1989, should have made 
it clear that until the United States sorts out its own complex stakes in Hong 
Kong and China and then forges its own Hong Kong policy, America will be stuck 
in a shamefully reactive role. 
</P>
<P>
There are indications that this truth has hit home. "Hong Kong has become a 
factor in U.S. foreign policy considerations," said U.S. Consul General Richard 
L. Williams in a recent speech in New York. Williams pinpointed the 
Sino-British joint declaration and the maintenance of Hong Kong's stability and 
prosperity as the basis of American policy. He cited new immigration 
provisions, encouragement of American business in Hong Kong, support for Hong 
Kong's participation in international organizations and proposed bilateral 
legal agreements as key policy components. Most significantly, he said 
Americans supported the democratization of Hong Kong. These are all elements of 
a sound policy, long overdue. Now there must be a fuller elaboration much more 
widely and forcefully expressed.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During one Christmas season in the course of World War I, German and Allied 
troops fraternized across the trenches, to the horror of their commanders. The 
men much preferred saying "Happy Christmas" to trying to kill each other. There 
are no trenches now, but today the argot of amity is more complicated. During 
the mid-December Euro-summit in Rome, the newspapers sprouted an almost 
impenetrable undergrowth of prose about the "hard ecu" and the merits of a 
central bank for the entire European Community. 
</P>
<P>
The complexity makes some folk reel and holler for traditional verities, like 
the "good old pound." Such nostalgia about the national currency is probably 
more a function of age than anything else. Polls show that younger people are 
much more laconic about Euro-fusion. But some British people over 60 cherish 
the old, white five-pound note, which looked like a personal letter from the 
governor of the Bank of England. As a boy who used to get a few of them pressed 
into my palm by uncles and aunts at Christmas time, I revere the former Irish 
half-crown, a beautiful silver coin with a horse on it. 
</P>
<P>
It's the same with national boundaries. Back in the 1950s, the working people 
of Cork City thought it a fine holiday to travel down by rail some 30 miles to 
the spacious beaches of Youghal. We folks of Youghal traveled over to Ardmore, 
eight miles east, for our vacation. I took a poll in the pub in Ardmore the 
other night and recent holiday destinations included the Canary Islands (very 
popular with the Irish), Turkey, as well as the United States, which of course 
is second home and workplace of last resort. In this perspective, "Europe" is a 
matter of work permits, customs dues and other brusque economic realities, but 
not an affront to national senses of identity. 
</P>
<P>
But behind the varying "senses" of Europe (which in Ardmore means a sign 
outside the village announcing that the European Community is financing the 
widening of the local highway) there are some basic, crude questions that can 
be glimpsed through the verbal fog. These concern not so much the desirability 
of a more closely federated Europe but what the nature of this federation would 
be. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment there is no real federated structure. The community has no army, 
no police, no prisons and only a few thousand employees. But, despite the lack 
of a federal infrastructure, there are pan-European structural realities, most 
fundamentally the economic power of Germany, hence of the deutsche mark. To 
offset this, the British are maneuvering for a "hard ecu" (European currency 
unit), but this could end up being essentially the selfsame deutsche mark, with 
values and interest rates set by a European Central Bank dominated by Germany. 
</P>
<P>
This raises the question of democratic control, just as the role of a Federal 
Reserve dominated by Eastern bankers has raised questions about democratic 
control in the United States ever since the establishment of the reserve 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Right now the European Council of Ministers uses EC powers to press through 
measures that have no detailed sanction from either national parliaments or the 
European Parliament. The community suffers from something politely known as a 
"deficit of democracy." This deficit springs from the original impulse for the 
European Economic Community, which was an attempt to achieve some coordination 
among a collection of regional capitalist powers. 
</P>
<P>
And indeed the community could, in the next phase, remain just such a 
coordinating unit: a formidable cartel set to do battle with the emerging 
dollar and yen blocs west and east of it, but without proper democratic 
supervision and hence without pressure for communitywide standards on wages, 
the work week, labor rights, women's rights, civil liberties, environmental 
standards and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
Crammed up against the windows of this bloc, peering enviously in from the 
cold, perhaps given "associated status," would be the Eastern European nations, 
allowed a sparse amount of bailout money and treated as a reserve army of the 
unemployed or low-paid with which to chasten better-paid Western European 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to establish an alternative to this corporate utopia will be the 
business of the next generation of the European left, starting with full 
membership for Eastern European nations as well as for Austria, Sweden and 
Turkey, which are now pressing to join. In such a truly pan-European community 
the struggle for democratic accountability and controls can honestly begin, in 
language rather more accessible than the bureaucratic lingo that is the present 
idiom of the community.

MCCARTHY WAS RIGHT ON THE RED MENACE; 
</P>
<P>
A GREAT AMERICAN PATRIOT WARNED US WHAT COMMUNISM WAS ALL ABOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER SCRUTON, Roger Scruton is a writer and philosopher who teaches at the 
University of London. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Christmas is the season of goodwill, the time when enemies are forgiven and 
friends restored to favor. It is also a time of "rehabilitation," in which the 
outcasts return to the fold, to be welcomed back into human society. 
</P>
<P>
All over Eastern Europe the process of rehabilitation is gathering momentum: 
Those who were wrongly imprisoned by the communists are being compensated; 
those who lost their property are recovering it; those who suffered for their 
opposition are blessed with influence and power. People who have been vilified 
for years as "agents of imperialism," "enemies of the people" and "fascist 
conspirators' are crowned today with heroes' garlands, and hardly a soul in the 
former "socialist countries" begrudges them their triumph. 
</P>
<P>
Charity, however, begins at home. In the long, hard fight against communism, we 
too acquired our victims, whose rehabilitation is now a matter of the greatest 
urgency. I think in particular of a great American patriot whose name has been 
a term of abuse to intellectuals of my generation on a level comparable to the 
names of Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin: Sen. Joseph McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
Time and again decent people have tried to describe what communism really is, 
and to warn against the methods used to advance it, only to be denounced for 
their "McCarthyism." Time and again the senator from Wisconsin has been invoked 
to silence those who have pointed to fellow-travelers in our universities and 
diplomatic services. 
</P>
<P>
For a while there was no worse accusation in the intellectual world than that 
of anti-communism, and no meaner place in the academic hierarchy than that 
occupied by the critics of Soviet power. And those who suggested that there 
were organizations -- the British campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, for 
instance -- which were dominated by communists and used to further their 
destructive designs, would be laughed to scorn, and all but driven from the 
academy. 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, however, that McCarthy was right. Maybe he went over the top; 
maybe it wasn't necessary to point the finger quite so rapidly or in quite so 
many directions. But the poor guy was exasperated; he had taken on the greatest 
criminal conspiracy the world has ever known, and was all but weaponless before 
the secrecy and deception whereby it worked its grim enchantment. Of course, we 
don't know the full extent of the damage inflicted by our communists and fellow 
travelers. But we have a fairly good idea. For example, it was thanks to the 
penetration of British diplomatic services during World War II that Marshal 
Tito's partisans were adopted by Western governments as the rightful rulers of 
Yugoslavia, and that the brave Albanians who went to liberate their country 
were betrayed to the communists. It was the influence of communists and their 
friends -- in diplomacy, in the academic world and in journalism -- that led to 
the easy acceptance of the illegitimate governments of Eastern Europe after 
1948, and which caused us to turn a blind eye to the sufferings of millions, so 
as to lick the boots of their masters. 
</P>
<P>
I think of the work of such historians as E. H. Carr, Christopher Hill and Eric 
Hobsbawm; of philosophical apologists like Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Paul 
Sartre and Louis Althusser; of the Establishment Sovietologists, prepared to 
sacrifice truth itself for the sake of that precious visa and those "privileged 
connections" with the Soviet apparatus, so necessary to a successful academic 
career. 
</P>
<P>
I think of those notorious Cambridge intellectuals, Harold (Kim) Philby, Guy 
Burgess, Donald Maclean and Anthony Blunt, whose single-minded commitment to a 
cause that their moral poverty prevented them from understanding contributed to 
the deaths of thousands and the enslavement of millions more. Was not Sen. 
McCarthy right to warn against this kind of thing, and to castigate the moral 
corruption of a philosophy that places Utopian internationalism above the real 
and comprehensible loyalty to one's country and to the people who compose it? 
</P>
<P>
The truth about communism has been apparent, to anyone who cared to know it, 
since 1917. It is a testimony to the degeneracy of our intellectual classes, 
which on the whole, with a few brave exceptions, have not cared to know it, 
preferring instead to vilify those "anti-communists" and McCarthyites who had 
the impertinence to remind them. In all the dreadful story of Western weakness 
and gullibility, a few people stand out as prepared to sacrifice even their 
reputations, even the respect of their fellows, for the sake of unwelcome 
truths. And by no means the least of these was Sen. Joseph McCarthy.

THE JOY AND THE PRIDE OF TEACHING A CLASS, NOT A MOB

<TEXT>
<P>
I am sitting at my desk at Bell High School, reading compositions written by my 
9th-grade English class. My students have written essays in the form of news 
reports. Their topic: the death of Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet. I am 
bursting with pride and anger. 
</P>
<P>
No "gifted" students these. They are labeled "average." Their essays are among 
the best I've ever seen for that grade level, and I've been looking for 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
How is it possible to get such superior work out of "average" kids? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is that there are only 13 kids in the class. (How did I get such a 
small class? A scheduling fluke.) A class of 35 to 40 "average" 9th-graders 
would never produce such high-quality work. With such big numbers the teacher 
has to spend as much time dealing with behavioral problems as he or she does 
teaching. There is virtually no time for individualized instruction, and the 
increased time spent on paper-grading means proportionally less time for 
creative lesson preparation. 
</P>
<P>
This is nothing new. Everyone connected with education knows the effect of 
class size on student accomplishment. And that's why I'm angry. Piled on my 
desk is the clearest evidence I've ever seen of what my colleagues and I can 
accomplish, given a reasonable chance to reach students' minds. Why are we not 
given a chance? How many more uninspired imaginations and undereducated 
intellects are we going to shove out the schoolhouse door, clutching worthless 
academic diplomas in their hands, for a march into substandard jobs and 
economically deprived lives. 
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, I was stopped on the school quad and informed that because of 
the small number of students this class will be closed next month. I need to 
rush and teach them all I can before they become lost in the mobs that populate 
our other classrooms. How will anyone reach them? 
</P>
<P>
Of Juan Aguilar I speak, and Armando Gutierrez, and Graciela Gonzales; Ron 
Washington, Shawna Jackson and Han Nguyen, victims of overcrowded classrooms 
and assembly-line education, an oxymoron in any teacher's terms. 
</P>
<P>
Wake up, America. Their future is our future.

BLUES AND BLACKHAWKS, BEST IN NHL, TIE AT 6-6

<TEXT>
<P>
The St. Louis Blues looked to be cruising Wednesday night, when they built a 
three-goal lead after one period against the Chicago Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
But it took a goal by Jeff Brown with 4 minutes 43 seconds left in regulation 
for the Blues to salvage a 6-6 tie at Chicago in a game between the NHL's top 
two teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks, who trailed, 3-0, after one period and 5-3 after two, went 
ahead, 6-5, with 8:06 remaining, when Adam Creighton and Wayne Presley scored 
seven seconds apart. Steve Larmer had cut the deficit to, 5-4, by beating 
Vincent Riendeau with a short wrist shot at 6:08 for his 25th goal of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Brown tied it when he picked up a loose puck and beat Ed Belfour with a slap 
shot from the top of the left circle. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks, who were shut out by the Blues last Saturday, 5-0, had a power 
play in the overtime, but Doug Wilson's shot from point-blank range hit the 
post. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues trail the Blackhawks, 53-48, in the Norris Division and the overall 
NHL standings, but St. Louis has four games in hand. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Hull, the NHL's top goal-scorer, got his 37th in 36 games and 12th 
power-play goal, when he beat Belfour with a 25-foot wrist shot for a 4-1 lead. 
Hull has goals in five of his last six games. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 7, Washington 3 -- Paul Coffey scored twice in 39 seconds during a 
five-goal first period at Landover, Md., to help extend the Capitals' winless 
streak to a season-high six games. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey's 15th and 16th goals began a spree in which the Penguins scored four 
times in a span of 2:16. Bryan Trottier got the third goal, the 1,369th of his 
16-year career, to move into a sixth-place tie with John Bucyk on the NHL's 
all-time scoring list. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins, who scored on four of their first five shots against Mike Liut, 
improved to 7-1 in their last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 4, Quebec 1 -- The line of Ron Francis, Rob Brown and Pat Verbeek 
combined for nine points -- a goal and two assists each -- to lead the Whalers 
at Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford goalie Peter Sidorkiewicz stopped 32 shots and had a shutout until 
Tony McKegney scored at 6:12 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec failed to score in seven power-play chances, including three in the 
first period. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 3, Buffalo 3 -- Benoit Hogue scored the tying goal late in the second 
period and the Sabres, though outshot, 35-16, by the Bruins, hung on for the 
tie at Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Sabre goalie Clint Malarchuk preserved the tie with 7:40 remaining in 
regulation, when he got a toe on Dave Poulin's breakaway shot. The shot hit 
both posts before the net was dislodged. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin goaltender Andy Moog extended his unbeaten streak to eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg 6, Minnesota 4 -- Ed Olczyk had two goals and an assist at 
Bloomington, Minn., as the Jets ended a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Olczyk left the the game early in the third period after sustaining a bruised 
left shoulder on a hard hit by Minnesota's Brian Propp.

Lowlights, dark nights and weird sights of football, 1990, as culled from the 
Dead Season Scrolls: 
</P>
<P>
HIGH SCHOOLS 
</P>
<P>
A 5-foot-8 member of the girls' cheerleading team at Coronado High (Colo.), 
whose "great legs" drew admiring comments from one player on the football team, 
turned out to be a 26-year-old man. 
</P>
<P>
THE COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
Hofstra quarterback Rhory Moss admitted he used steroids but only because he 
was going to spend "spring break in the Bahamas last April and I wanted to put 
on a few pounds to look good." 
</P>
<P>
Spike Dykes, Texas Tech football coach, who suffered his worst season this year 
at 4-7, was given a 10-year contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
Ready for a Naked Reverse: Arizona defensive back McCann Utu posed nude in 
Playgirl magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Planning a Naked Reverse: An Oregon State player was accused of shoplifting 
Penthouse magazine. 
</P>
<P>
All the University of Maine had to show for a 10,340 mile trip was a 3-44 loss 
to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Miami fans enraged by the upset loss to Brigham Young pelted the Hurricane 
players' dorms with bottles. 
</P>
<P>
Passages: Bo Schembechler began the year by coaching Michigan to a Rose Bowl 
loss against USC and ended the year, as Detroit Tiger president, by firing Hall 
of Fame broadcaster Ernie Harwell. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado led the nation in fifth-down efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Winner of the annual Most-Outrageous-Lou-Holtz-Statement-of-the-Year 
competition: "(Coach) Frank Leahy was here three years and went to war. I think 
sometimes that would be a welcome relief to get away from the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Does Playgirl magazine know about this?: Trudi Marinovich, mother of USC 
quarterback/art major Todd Marinovich, laughingly told the Orange County media 
that her son had fashioned drawings of the Trojan coaches during the season, 
"some of them . . . R-rated." 
</P>
<P>
THE PROS 
</P>
<P>
Denver receiver Vance Johnson claimed he was injured when his tongue was 
grabbed by Seattle's Melvin Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota held a preseason camp in New Mexico to foster togetherness, then lost 
six of its first seven games. General Manager Mike Lynn announced he was 
leaving to join the new international football league to foster togetherness 
there. 
</P>
<P>
After the uproar over admitting female reporters to the locker rooms, the NFL 
took immediate action, announcing it would market officially licensed bathrobes 
and wraparound towels. 
</P>
<P>
Two male disc jockeys from a Milwaukee radio station stripped to their athletic 
supporters and socks to interview players after a Green Bay-Chicago game. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota defensive players squirted water on the ball against Green Bay, 
causing it to slip from the grasp of quarterback Anthony Dilweg on the next 
play as he rolled out. 
</P>
<P>
Angered by comments Washington quarterback Gary Hogeboom had made about 
Phoenix, Cardinal Coach Joe Bugel offered to fight him on the 50-yard-line 
before one game. 
</P>
<P>
During a 7-30 loss to Buffalo, New York Jet Coach Bruce Coslet motioned for a 
heckler in the stands to come down on the field to fight. It wasn't Gary 
Hogeboom. 
</P>
<P>
After eating a huge pregame meal of eggs and spaghetti, Brent Fullwood, then a 
Green Bay Packer, claimed he was sick at halftime of a game against the Bears 
and insisted on remaining in the locker room. He was spotted that night dancing 
in a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
Against New Orleans, 300-pound San Francisco tackle Bubba Paris was observed 
off-sides, holding and grabbing a face mask -- all on the same play.

CELTICS RUN TO 152-132 VICTORY OVER PACERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
The Boston Celtics sprinted up and down the court Wednesday night against the 
Indiana Pacers and ran off with the fifth-biggest offensive show in team 
history. 
</P>
<P>
For the Celtics, their 152-132 rout of the Pacers at Boston was their highest 
point total in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last month, we've been getting balanced scoring from five or six 
players," Celtic swingman Reggie Lewis said. "We are making the game fun 
because of our defense. We've executed the offense the way we've wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics' eighth consecutive victory was the latest blowout in a season 
filled with them. Their 23-4 record is their best start since they had the same 
mark in 1984-85. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Brian Shaw, who had 26 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds, led the 
running attack and was one of eight Celtics to score in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
"They're going to be tough to beat when they run like that," said Reggie 
Miller, who led the Pacers with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics are 19-2 in their last 21 games and lead the Eastern Conference 
with 116.2 points per game. Boston's team record of 173 points in a game was 
set in 1959. The Celtics have scored 153 three times, the last time against 
Philadelphia Nov. 27, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Boston broke its previous season-high of 148 points against Denver Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Bird added 22 points, and Kevin McHale, Kevin Gamble and Lewis had 19 
each for the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 106, Washington 105 -- Charles Barkley scored 35 points, including 
four in overtime, to lead the 76ers at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive victory for the 76ers, who stopped the Bullets' 
three-game win streak. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard King led the Bullets with 35 points. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 102, Charlotte 94 -- Joe Dumars scored 19 points and William Bedford 
added 16 at Auburn Hills, Mich., as the Pistons dealt the Hornets a 
franchise-tying 10th consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
Bedford's point total was his highest since he scored 17 for Phoenix during his 
rookie season of 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando 109, Houston 103 -- Nick Anderson scored a career-high 31 points, 
including 17 in the third quarter, to help the Magic end an eight-game losing 
streak with the victory at Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson made 11 of 18 shots and grabbed eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Akeem Olajuwon had 25 points, 20 rebounds and seven blocked shots for the 
Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 99, Cleveland 97 -- Derrick McKey made an 18-foot jump shot from the 
baseline with 2.3 seconds left at Richfield, Ohio, to give the SuperSonics 
their fifth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers, who have lost nine of 10 games, had one last shot, but Steve 
Kerr's three-point attempt bounced off the rim and Larry Nance's follow-up 
jumper went in, but after the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 113, New Jersey 111 -- Kevin Willis had 26 points and 15 rebounds to 
lead the Hawks against the Nets at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The Nets began the game without starting forward Chris Morris, lost forward 
Derrick Coleman to a sprained knee in the second quarter and then had center 
Sam Bowie foul out in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Gervin had a career-high 34 points for the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 108, New York 92 -- Clyde Drexler and Kevin Duckworth combined for 20 
of the Trail Blazers' 28 points in the third quarter at New York as Portland 
won its ninth consecutive road game against an Atlantic Division opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Portland improved its NBA-best records to 25-3 and 10-2 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 115, Dallas 88 -- Tom Chambers scored 24 points and had 11 rebounds and 
Kevin Johnson added 19 points at Phoenix as the Suns continued their mastery of 
the Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
Xavier McDaniel had 14 points, Jeff Hornacek 13 and Mark West 12 for the Suns, 
who beat the Mavericks for the fifth consecutive time at home and eighth time 
in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 126, Golden State 119 -- Jay Humphries and Ricky Pierce each scored 
28 points and Alvin Robertson recorded his third triple double of the season as 
the Bucks won their 14th consecutive home game to remain the NBA's only 
undefeated team at home this season. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson had 25 points, 16 rebounds and 12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 111, Miami 97 -- Willie Anderson scored 24 points and Rod 
Strickland added 21 at San Antonio as the Spurs overcame an 11-minute stretch 
without a field goal to win for the ninth time in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
David Robinson had 15 points and matched his season high with 18 rebounds for 
the Spurs, who suited up only nine players. 
</P>
<P>
Denver 128, Sacramento 112 -- Michael Adams scored a career-high 44 points, 
including seven three-point baskets, as the Nuggets won at Sacramento, only 
their second victory in 14 road games this season.

TAME AS A NOVEL, WILD AS BOOK ON PUMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES BOWDEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The White Puma" is a story in which the hunter becomes the hunted. The puma is 
white, the big-game guides crude, the rich folks out of shape, and the traders 
of poached animals evil; the dedicated conservationists have good skin and 
sensible diets. In the end, the good guys and gals win, the bad folks learn or 
get a comeuppance. 
</P>
<P>
R. D. Lawrence has written 16 books, traveled the world as a field biologist, 
and as background research for this novel spent 10 months (three seasons) alone 
in the Canadian wilds observing one particular cat. This wealth of field notes 
makes appearances throughout the text. 
</P>
<P>
The plot is simple: Walt Taggert and Steve Cousins are uneducated guides 
working out of a resort in northern British Columbia and poaching game on the 
side. In one encounter with a puma, Taggert is spooked by the big cat and 
accidentally falls into a huge steel trap he has set for the animal, thereby 
losing his right arm. He becomes a hero with his tales of a killer cat. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, a white puma turns up in the hundreds of square miles where the two 
men hunt. After killing the cat's sister and mother (which is, unknown to 
Taggert, the puma responsible for his severed arm), the two men become bogged 
down in a war with the animal. The cat twice tries to kill them -- once 
attacking Taggert on horseback, the second time dive-bombing their tent in the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Besides selling parts of bears, lions and other animals as love potions in a 
smuggling operation in the Orient, the two men agree to track and kill the 
white cat for a $12,000 payment by a rich German hunter. When word of this hunt 
gets out, a Canadian conservation group headed by Heather Lansing intervenes. 
</P>
<P>
In the end: Heather bonds with the white puma, is accidentally shot by Steve 
Cousins, converts him to conservationism, and sets up a research project in 
which Cousins, having sworn off hunting because he now realizes animals can 
think, becomes the official game warden protecting the cat. And, of course, the 
cops are told of the poaching/smuggling network and shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence's scientific training sometimes pops up in his choice of language -- 
"As he entered the darkened grotto, memory nagged at his cortex" -- but more 
often appears in asides about the biology of pumas, their prey and their 
habitat. In many ways, this is the most valuable part of the book. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Farley Mowat's "Never Cry Wolf!" educated a mass audience about pack 
behavior, this novel will teach almost everyone facts they didn't know about an 
elusive carnivore. There are many kills in the story, and these descriptions 
are convincing and oddly comforting -- a welcome respite from feel-good 
environmentalism. Of course, as in any novel based on 
</P>

This is the book we are almost preconditioned to want to like. I've seen two 
mountain lions in my life, and those brief encounters still feed and comfort me 
during various bleak urban days. Pumas show up on T-shirts on city streets as 
symbols of the wild and the free. 
</P>
<P>
fact, one is always a bit unsure just what is fact and what is invention. 
</P>
<P>
The book reads well for a scientific text on pumas, but stumbles as a novel. 
The characters are cardboard: Taggert was a sensitive boy who became a killing 
machine to live up to this dad's expectations; the conservationists seem molded 
out of some high-fiber substance. The dialogue is stilted, and the plot -- 
well, the plot is a melodrama (not just a puma, but a white puma!). 
</P>
<P>
The denouement of the book rests on the fact that the puma feels good vibes 
coming off Heather because of the laid-back way she smells, and he can't stand 
a whiff of the whiskey-drinking, cigarette-smoking guides hunting him with 
rifles, dogs and an overweight German. 
</P>
<P>
This is the book we are almost preconditioned to want to like. I've seen two 
mountain lions in my life, and those brief encounters still feed and comfort me 
during various bleak urban days. Pumas show up on T-shirts on city streets as 
symbols of the wild and the free. 
</P>
<P>
But as novel, this book never really comes alive, and as an introduction to 
puma biology, the fact that it is a novel always muddies our understanding. 
Also, I am skeptical that such a black-and-white view of the world as Lawrence 
presents here -- one in which the hunters of pumas are louts, the defenders of 
wildlife pure souls, and the puma itself is white, rare and noble -- will rally 
anyone to the cause except the already converted. 
</P>
<P>
To achieve that feat, to capture those who have no particular interest in wild 
animals or wild country, the author has to seduce the reader with the sheer 
force of an imagined world, just as an entire nation seemed to succumb to 
Harriet Beecher Stowe's "Uncle Tom's Cabin." Pumas and readers will have to 
wait for that book.

"Salmon eggs Benedict or traditional eggs Benedict?" 
</P>
<P>
That was about as tough as the questions got for guests who attended the Red 
Cross brunch staged at 21 Oceanfront (formerly the Rex) in Newport Beach on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Waiters and waitresses hovered near brunch-goers such as Red Cross Board 
Chairman Donald Karcher and his wife, Dolly, making sure that their eggs were 
hot, their orange juice chilled and their champagne flutes filled to the brim. 
Restaurant booths were crammed with folks sporting holiday finery. (No doubt 
about it, this is society's favorite spot to unwind before the Big Day.) 
</P>
<P>
Overseeing the seventh annual event -- where the food and service are donated 
-- was restaurateur Rex Chandler and his wife, Susan. "We're ecstatic today," 
said Chandler, whose new Rex restaurant in Fashion Island has become the place 
to dine in Newport Beach. "The weather is beautiful and the reservation list is 
long." 
</P>
<P>
As guests enjoyed a first course of fresh fruit and croissants "Santa's little 
helpers" (little girls smartly dressed for Christmas) sold Red Cross sweat 
shirts, enabling brunch proceeds to hit the $50,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Besides helping the needy, the local chapter of the Red Cross is the primary 
source for emergency communication between military personnel and their 
families, said chapter director George Chitty. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the local chapter provided 28,398 meals for needy families. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Rex: The new Rex at Fashion Island was the site of the recent 
Christmas luncheon staged by the Sophisticates, a support group of the 
Assessment and Treatment Services Center (ATSC). What made this get-together 
super-hot was that it launched lunch at the Rex, giving the in-crowd yet 
another chic, daytime place to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Among items on the menu are Thai chicken salad; a lobster sandwich (hint: order 
this biggie to split with a buddy) and a French dip sandwich (for 
sandwich-classic lovers, says owner Rex Chandler). 
</P>
<P>
ATSC -- whose motto is "arrest the problem, not the child" -- provides troubled 
juveniles with professional counseling. After an initial assessment, a specific 
treatment is designed to help keep the juvenile out of the criminal justice 
system. Also on the Rex calendar is a luncheon-auction for ATSC on Jan. 19 
marking the opening of the new Lahaina Gallery at Fashion Island. Lahaina 
artist Gary Swanson plans to attend. 
</P>
<P>
Mark your calendar: The Orange County Juvenile Correction Program will be the 
beneficiary of a Super Bowl party Jan. 27 at the Santa Ana Heights mansion of 
Donna and John Crean. Celebrity guests are on the agenda, and hamburgers and 
hot dogs will be served. Tickets are $150 per person with proceeds expected to 
reach $50,000. They're calling the spot where the event will be held (John 
Crean's workshop) the "Creandome." What else?

ART BUCHWALD: WITH TV, IT'S POLITICIANS AS USUAL

<TEXT>
<P>
The network news executives met to decide what politicians they would book for 
the 1991 season. 
</P>
<P>
All the guests for the news shows had been used up in 1990, so the executives 
were faced with renewing them or putting them on waivers for the new year. 
</P>
<P>
Blunt said: "Do we want to sign up Secretary of Defense Cheney for another 12 
months?" 
</P>
<P>
Blowtorch replied: "He's been on every program, including 'People's Court.' 
Frankly, I think he's overexposed." 
</P>
<P>
"Who else can we get to speak for defense -- Ollie North?" Notory yelled. 
"Let's renew Cheney until we find another spokesperson, preferably a tall 
blonde who looks like Jane Pauley." 
</P>
<P>
"OK, we stick with Cheney. What do we do about Secretary of State Baker's 
contract?" Blunt asked. 
</P>
<P>
"If we keep Baker as a guest, why do we need Henry Kissinger? They both say the 
same thing." 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, but with different accents." 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't we hold on to Baker for television and save Kissinger for radio?" 
Notory suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"How about Baker for the Brinkley show and Kissinger for 'Nightline'?" 
</P>
<P>
Blunt said: "The last time we used Baker on the Brinkley show, we got a 3 
rating." 
</P>
<P>
Blowtorch protested: "It's not the person, it's the job. Secretaries of state 
never get good ratings." 
</P>
<P>
Notory said: "Are we renewing Sununu?" 
</P>
<P>
"You better believe it. There is nobody with as much fire in his belly as 
Sununu. Barbara Walters would take him over Donald Trump and Marla Maples 
combined." 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to think of what 'Meet the Press' would be like without Sununu." 
</P>
<P>
"Not to mention all of CNN." 
</P>
<P>
"I know that this is a silly question," Notory said, "but are we renewing Dan 
Quayle?" 
</P>
<P>
"We have to lighten up Sam Donaldson somehow," Blunt replied. "Besides, our 
surveys indicate the viewers like watching Quayle for the same reason they 
enjoy watching a train wreck." 
</P>
<P>
Blowtorch interrupted: "Let's move along. How do we feel about signing up 
Secretary of Treasury Brady as a guest?" 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knows who Brady is. You could put his picture on every milk carton in 
America, and they still wouldn't have any idea why he was on television." 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't take Brady, we need one more person from the Bush Administration 
to service 'Face the Nation.' " 
</P>
<P>
"There is none," Blunt retorted. "We're going to have to sign Newt Gingrich 
again." 
</P>
<P>
"If we use Gingrich, we're going to have to invite House Speaker Tom Foley." 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Foley talk about the budget on McNeil/Lehrer, and he took the show to 
the bottom of the sea. He died about the same time they did." 
</P>
<P>
"So where does that leave us?" 
</P>
<P>
"We still have one more possibility. Are we going to use Jesse Jackson as a 
guest on the 'Today' show or not?" 
</P>
<P>
Blunt sighed: "What choice do we ever have?"

After the Stroh Brewery Co. plant in Van Nuys closed in February, Ray 
Seufferlein headed straight into unemployment. At 43, he hadn't expected to 
start his life all over again. 
</P>
<P>
Four months later, as the financial burden increased, Seufferlein spotted an 
advertisement for the sale of a pool service in the San Fernando Valley. He 
bought it for $30,000. The new life began. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss the camaraderie," the Saugus man said. "But it's paying the bills. And 
I'm working outside." 
</P>
<P>
Seufferlein, a machinist at Stroh's, was one of the laid-off workers profiled 
in an article in February. That's when the plant on Woodman Avenue, several 
blocks north of Sherman Way, laid off about 390 hourly and salaried workers. 
The company blamed the closing on its declining market share. 
</P>
<P>
Seufferlein cleans and repairs pools in Northridge, Sepulveda and Granada 
Hills. It's a 24-hour-a-day job. 
</P>
<P>
"When I used to leave Stroh's, I never took my work home," he said. "But now I 
have to think about it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Not so for Don Daniels, who also lost his job when Stroh's closed. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels, 55, immediately switched over to Miller Brewery Co. in Irwindale. He's 
doing the same job -- bottling. 
</P>
<P>
"It pays a little more," said Daniels of Castaic Lake. "But I have to drive 115 
miles every day, and I work from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
And Daniels is often laid off for a week or two. "That's the beer business," he 
said. "I can't make any plans 'cause I never know when I'm going to be working 
or not." MICHAEL ARKUSH

Northridge Park 
</P>
<P>
10058 Reseda Blvd., Northridge 
</P>
<P>
Size: 24 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Facilities: Indoor basketball gymnasium, three baseball diamonds, outdoor 
basketball court, football field, children's play area, picnic area, four 
lighted tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
Hours: 9 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. Monday through Friday; 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday; 
10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (818) 349-7341. 
</P>
<P>
For Javier Soto, the best thing about being director of Northridge Park is 
watching the number of families who regularly use the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"In the summer, the parents bring their children and the whole family uses the 
swimming pool," Soto said. "And now, they come together for picnics, baseball 
and youth basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Because the park is so popular with families in the Northridge area, more than 
120 courses are offered in the community building. In addition to traditional 
arts and crafts and aerobics classes, Northridge Park has instruction in 
Hawaiian dance, vegetarian cooking, horseback riding and juggling, as well as a 
variety of music classes. The courses last 10 weeks and sign-ups for the next 
session take place in early January. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't just that there's so much to do here," Soto said. "People seem to 
love Northridge Park because it's so clean and safe. It really is the perfect 
family park." KAREN KINGSBURY

VOLUNTEER GROUPS TAKE FREEWAYS INTO THEIR CARE; 
</P>
<P>
CALTRANS: CONCERNED CITIZENS CLEAN THE ROADSIDES AS PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF 
TRANSPORTATION'S ADOPT-A-HIGHWAY PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LUSTIG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Lustig is a regular contributor to 
Valley View. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The people in orange vests and helmets picking up discarded coffee cups, 
cigarette butts and banana peels by the side of the road might not be Caltrans 
employees or probationers and inmates. They could be your law-abiding neighbors 
who have adopted stretches of the state's freeways and highways and taken 
responsibility for cleaning up the litter. 
</P>
<P>
These citizens are part of the statewide Adopt-a-Highway program, which began 
in 1989. Six organizations in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope 
valleys -- ranging from employees of a fast-food chain to members of a mining 
association -- have been accepted by or are applying to the state Department of 
Transportation to become involved in the trash pickup. 
</P>
<P>
One of the groups is the leadership class at Desert Christian High School in 
Lancaster. Principal Will Wilson and 16 students take care of both sides of the 
Antelope Valley Freeway between avenues J and L. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to give back to the community where you live and work," Wilson 
said. "Besides being a great idea, it gives everyone a chance to become 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
"We learned a lot," said Wilson, 35, who, along with a Caltrans representative, 
chaperones the teen-agers. "It was a lot harder project than I realized. The 
slopes, the tumbleweeds and the blisters," he said, adding that his group 
filled more than 100 bags on a recent outing. 
</P>
<P>
Open to nonpolitical organizations, corporations, groups and individuals, 
California's Adopt-a-Highway program is similar to those in more than two dozen 
other states. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody from the Boy Scouts to the Civil Air Patrol to college fraternities 
and church groups is interested," said James L. Knox, 53, Caltrans program 
coordinator for Los Angeles and Ventura counties. "It's great to see the 
community involved." 
</P>
<P>
Once Caltrans assigns a section of the road -- usually about two miles -- to a 
group, the volunteers agree to work the area at least four times a year for a 
two-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers are asked only to collect the litter in trash bags, Knox said; 
Caltrans employees later throw the bags on trucks. In return, the workers are 
rewarded with a 4-by-7-foot roadside sign informing motorists that the area is 
just a little cleaner thanks to their hard work. 
</P>
<P>
While recognition is appreciated, volunteers say it is local pride that made 
them sign up for the program. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our goals was to find a way to serve the community," Wilson said of his 
group. With the motto, "To Learn by Doing, Lead by Serving," the 
Adopt-a-Highway program seemed an obvious choice as a project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the High Desert Contractors Assn. in Lancaster said they joined the 
program because they didn't like seeing their area so trashed. The association 
takes care of two miles of California 138 between 40th Street East and Avenue 
S. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for us to do community service projects," member Debbie 
Richard, 27, said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have quite a sense of accomplishment when we're finished for the day, and I 
yell at people when I see them toss something out of the car." 
</P>
<P>
The association picks up about 22 truckloads of trash per outing, she said, 
adding that members also keep an eye out for motorists who think that the 
roadside is their garbage can. "I'll write down their license plate and turn 
them in," Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
Sigma Chi fraternity brothers at Cal State Northridge say they like the program 
because it gives them a chance not only to support the community -- they've 
adopted the Simi Valley Freeway from Balboa Boulevard to Tampa Avenue -- but to 
improve the image of fraternities. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to get rid of the 'Animal House' image many fraternities have," said 
Rick Golden, 19. "For so many of us, it's far from the truth." 
</P>
<P>
The Western Mining Council, which represents miners and prospectors, has signed 
up for a stretch of Topanga Canyon Boulevard from Nordhoff Street to the Simi 
Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's not hot, it's a very enjoyable experience, and we're treated to a view 
of the Santa Susana Mountains," council member Dan Velcoff said. "But you are 
drained." 
</P>
<P>
Volunteering to pick up trash, however, doesn't mean one can make a beeline to 
the freeway or highway with a helmet and a trash bag. Caltrans won't let anyone 
participate without a complete safety briefing, and some stretches of road are 
off-limits for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned about their welfare," said Tom Pellerin, 47, of Caltrans. "And 
we certainly don't want anyone hurt, which means the volunteers are instructed 
not to touch sealed drums of any kind, anything that might smell, syringes, 
needles or broken glass." 
</P>
<P>
Still, what's left for the volunteers to pick up isn't necessarily boring. 
</P>
<P>
In their first few hours as roadside garbage collectors, the 14- and 
15-year-old students from Desert Christian High found golf balls, a hubcap, a 
Frisbee, a couple of five-gallon water bottles, a gas cap, a poster advertising 
a topless bar, a license plate, a Dear John letter, a size 10 1/2 left shoe, 
condoms, a wallet, men's underwear, a photo of "Ron and Vicki's wedding 
reception" dated 1971, and lots of soiled disposable diapers. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll make me think twice about throwing litter out of the car," said 
orange-helmeted sophomore Jennifer Abate, 15, holding up Ron and Vicki's photo. 
</P>
<P>
"People will throw almost anything out their car window," Pellerin said. 
</P>
<P>
In his 18 years with Caltrans, Pellerin said he's also come across camper 
shells, sleeping bags, lots of single shoes, a kitchen sink and "anything that 
was ever thrown out of an ashtray." 
</P>
<P>
"We've had good luck with the program," he said. "The people show a lot of 
enthusiasm. There's more and more litter out there, and we don't have the time 
or manpower to concentrate on cleaning it up." 
</P>
<P>
"We made a dent," Wilson said of the 100 bags of litter he and his students 
picked up from both sides of their more than two-mile stretch. "A small one 
perhaps but, nevertheless, a dent. It'll be interesting to see how many of 
these same students come out again next time." 
</P>
<P>
 Groups or individuals interested in the Adopt-a-Highway program may contact 
Caltrans through James L. Knox, the coordinator for Ventura and Los Angeles 
counties, at (213) 620-4893.

Howdy, New Year 
</P>
<P>
Jack and Martha Jamieson will be at it again this New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
For 36 years -- with one exception -- they have hosted a party every Dec. 31 in 
their North Hollywood house, and this year it's business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Jack will cook for the midnight buffet, and he and Martha -- who are both 
eightysomething -- have cooked up the skit, which is the highlight of these 
annual high jinks. To hear Martha tell it, most of these little performance 
pieces would never qualify for a G movie rating. 
</P>
<P>
"This year we are doing 'Cinderella and the Madam,' set at the Cottontail Ranch 
in Nevada," she said, then paused. "You probably get the idea. My husband and I 
are both theatrical and musical, so we just sort of attracted friends who would 
like this sort of thing, and be willing to participate sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
In 1954, when the first party was given, she invited mostly friends from the 
PTA at Toluca Lake School where her children attended, and friends from local 
musical groups. 
</P>
<P>
"There were probably 30 or 40 of them, and everything was pretty informal 
then," she said. Over the years, the skits and the buffet grew to outrageous 
proportions and the size of the crowd did likewise. 
</P>
<P>
"I just had to put my foot down," Martha said. "There were more than 100 people 
in our little house and that just wasn't good. One year I called the whole 
thing off so people would get out of the habit of coming here. But the next 
year we started up again with a smaller guest list." 
</P>
<P>
This year there will be about 60 guests and they will be invited to come at 10 
p.m., "so they won't be standing around with nothing to do half the night." 
</P>
<P>
At midnight, according to Martha, the guests are invited to sample Frank's 
buffet. Afterward, everyone will watch the show and then go home. 
</P>
<P>
"We get the skit written up, cast the parts, then do the music. Frank directs 
and I play the piano for the singing," Martha said. 
</P>
<P>
This New Year's Eve they will again be surrounded by friends, and their house 
will be alive with laughter and singing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of work, but it's fun," Martha said. "It's nice to think we started 
a tradition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Be Prepared 
</P>
<P>
OK. Here's what's going to happen in the coming year -- straight from the 
planets to you -- and don't think it was easy getting this information. 
</P>
<P>
It seems this is the busiest time of year for psychics. They have a number of 
reasons for not wanting to give away predictions. 
</P>
<P>
Psychic Madam Joanne in Agoura said she wasn't interested in publicity or 
predicting about worldly things, she just does personal readings. 
</P>
<P>
Psychic astrologer Audrey in Canoga Park couldn't talk because she had company. 
</P>
<P>
The California Astrology Assn.'s answering service said no one would talk 
without an appointment, but offered to send a brochure. 
</P>
<P>
And the woman listed as the Royal Thai Star Path Astrologer in Studio City was 
on her way out the door but said not to worry too much about earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Helene Woodman Cushman of Tarzana -- the San Fernando Valley's answer 
to Nancy Reagan's Joan Quigley -- called to fill us in. 
</P>
<P>
We've been having confrontations in the Middle East because Saturn and Mars are 
configuring badly up there, causing those of us down here to push and shove. 
Cushman, who takes both the Middle East situation and astrology seriously, said 
things would ease up by March. 
</P>
<P>
"By and large, 1991 is going to be a much gentler year," she said. "The 
problems in the Middle East will not be resolved, but they will cool down 
considerably." 
</P>
<P>
Domestically, she said, the economy will level off. "We are not going to have a 
depression unless people lose their heads." 
</P>
<P>
According to Cushman, the planets say the stock market will continue to 
fluctuate, but the real estate market will revive. "By that I mean that the 
bottom is not going to fall out of the market," she said. "If you are looking 
for a bargain, you'd best jump in now." 
</P>
<P>
Cushman, who says she is directly descended from rebel minister Robert Cushman 
who arrived in this country on the Mayflower, said she figures out what is 
going to happen to the country partially by doing President Bush's charts. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush is going to stay angry and feel aggressive about foreign policy for quite 
awhile," she said, "but after the first of the year there will be some real 
mellowing influences on him." She didn't say what was going to make the stock 
and real estate markets behave the way she said they would, but she sounded 
confident. 
</P>
<P>
Cushman, who once ran an astrology studio in Encino that attracted several 
Hollywood stars and at least one studio head, now runs her business from her 
house. But the prices haven't relaxed with the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
She charges $200 an hour to do a personal chart, and for businesses that want 
her to do financial projections the cost is "much, much more." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hoopster Heaven 
</P>
<P>
Toys International in the Glendale Galleria has something that is as much fun 
for the big boys as for little kids. 
</P>
<P>
It's the Jordan Jammer, sells for $59.95 and is made for guys who dream of 
running around in basketball shorts instead of doing their daily legal briefs. 
</P>
<P>
The Jordan Jammer is an adjustable pole with a red, white and blue net, a 
picture of Michael Jordan on the backboard and a plastic ball that can turn any 
desk-bound executive into a potential NBA star. 
</P>
<P>
Although the store personnel said no one has admitted buying the thing for her 
husband, Janet Marley of Burbank fessed right up. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure that if I get this for my husband's office, he'll be grateful enough 
to take the garbage out without being asked," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tall Tails 
</P>
<P>
There are lots of bookstores in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope 
valleys, but An Affair With Books in Newhall has something extra. 
</P>
<P>
Cleo. 
</P>
<P>
Cleo, a black cat of unknown age who came from the pound three years ago, is 
the companion of bookstore owner Deborah L. Harth. 
</P>
<P>
Cleo, said Harth, is serious about her job as the main distraction. 
</P>
<P>
Cleo entertains the small fry while their parents shop. 
</P>
<P>
When she is not entertaining children, she walks up and down the aisles doing 
her impression of a watch cat, or she curls up in the front window in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
But when she hears children entering the shop, she's front and center, Harth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Overheard 
</P>
<P>
"My New Year's resolution is to put an end to wars, stop the rape of the 
ecosystem, reverse the economic recession and stop eating M &amp; Ms."

SAN DIEGO'S YEAR IN JAZZ; 
</P>
<P>
1990 SAW JAZZ SCENE GROW IN STATURE; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: EVEN THOUGH STRIDES MUST STILL BE MADE, JAZZ LOVERS ARE ENJOYING A NEW 
MATURITY IN SAN DIEGO CLUB ACTIVITY. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's jazz scene isn't out of adolescence yet, but it sprouted a few 
whiskers and grew to nearly full height in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Low wages, a shortage of club work for local players and the demise of some key 
clubs kept the scene wobbly despite its longer legs, but overall, jazz was 
bigger and stronger. Among the signs of new maturity: 
</P>
<P>
* Elario's was reborn under the guidance of San Diego Jazz Festival founder Rob 
Hagey, who began mixing young lions in with the club's usual lineup of veteran 
jazz stalwarts. 
</P>
<P>
* All That Jazz opened in Rancho Bernardo, and talent coordinator Tony Sidotti 
helped both the new club and the Horton Grand Hotel downtown expand their 
horizons to include such nationally known acts as Jimmy and Stacy Rowles, 
Milcho Leviev, Bill Mays and Barney Kessel. 
</P>
<P>
* The Jazz Link, the San Diego-based jazz monthly, celebrated its second 
birthday in May, added correspondents in Washington, D.C.; Philadelphia; 
Portland, Ore.; Denver, and Chattanooga, Tenn., and expanded its readership to 
47 states as well as Belgium, Denmark, Japan, England and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
* After a few false starts, KIFM (98.1) has a solid Sunday night straight-ahead 
jazz program. New host Ron Galon just might expand the horizons of the 
station's light jazz audience. 
</P>
<P>
* The San Diego Jazz Party in February and the Thanksgiving Dixieland festival 
in Mission Valley brought traditional jazz to large numbers of fans. 
</P>
<P>
* Croce's in downtown San Diego continued to present jazz twice a day, seven 
days a week, making it the leader in local live jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Of course growth didn't come without growing pains. 
</P>
<P>
As Elario's showcased more young, rising talents who 
</P>
<P>
wanted to bring their own bands, top locals such as drummer Jim Plank and 
bassist Bob Magnusson worked less at Elario's and had to look elsewhere to fill 
some nights. 
</P>
<P>
The demise of jazz jams at Kelly's Pub, the Salmon House and Croce's meant 
fewer chances for young players to test themselves against the pros, and for 
established locals to get together just for fun once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
The Beach House restaurant in Mission Beach and Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach 
discontinued jazz after struggling for months to build audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Diego's Loft may come back in 1991. Famed clarinetist Bobby Gordon hopes to 
work the room occasionally. And the Beach House's tiny bar may try jazz again 
next summer, but as of last summer, wasn't drawing enough people to support 
appearances by a variety of locals and talented out-of-towners including Denver 
pianist-vocalist Ellyn Rucker. 
</P>
<P>
What were the year's top performances? 
</P>
<P>
* Etta James, bold and bawdy at Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay, gave one of the 
most soulful performances during the summer concert series which generally 
leans toward middle-of-the-road light jazz and pop. 
</P>
<P>
* Chico Freeman brought his hip and gritty New York licks to Elario's, where he 
was equally at home on sax and flute. 
</P>
<P>
* Plus several hot performances by rising jazz stars at Elario's, including 
those by guitarist Bill Frisell, pianist Michel Camilo (with former San Diegan 
Cliff Almond on drums), saxophonist Christopher Hollyday and pianist Marcus 
Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
Keyboardist Keiko Matsui took top honors in the overexposure category. Earlier 
in the year, she played the Sunday jazz series at Culbertson's Winery in 
Temecula, and in the fall, made almost back-to-back appearances at the Michelob 
Street Scene and Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Alternative modes of jazz, however, didn't have many outlets in 1990. The Ruse 
Performance Gallery, which recently moved from space in the Gaslamp Quarter to 
the Marquis Public Theatre, presented some of the few performances by 
cutting-edge jazz groups including the Rova Saxophone Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Musicians Local 325 found itself fighting for respect as many jazz players 
chose not to join. Many feel that the union doesn't offer enough in exchange 
for the $78 annual dues; the union will attempt to improve its image by opening 
its own booking agency in January. 
</P>
<P>
While KIFM's repertoire expanded with Galon's Sunday night show, KSDS-FM 
(88.3), San Diego's only full-time jazz station, continued presenting a rich 
mix of music, events and special programs, most notably the seven-part radio 
biography of Miles Davis (it also aired on KPBS-FM). 
</P>
<P>
KSDS jock "T" celebrated his seventh anniversary as host of "Every Shade of 
Blue," the Saturday blues program. Longtime San Diego radio personality Rod 
Page, the self-dubbed "Golden Page of Music," joined KSDS with a Sunday 
afternoon show, and former KSDS jocks Christine Reeves and Ron Dhanifu returned 
to the fold with shows Sundays and Tuesdays. 
</P>
<P>
KPBS-TV taped 11 new "Club Date" programs during its 1990 fiscal year, bringing 
the total number of shows to more than 25. New shows featured Hank Jones, Buddy 
Collette, Mundell Lowe and, in a departure from the the usual straight-ahead 
fare, fusion keyboardist Rob Mullins. 
</P>
<P>
KPBS will make six new programs in 1991, beginning with tapings of Jeannie and 
Jimmy Cheatham and the Sweet Baby Blues Band Jan. 6 and saxophonist Frank 
Morgan Jan. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Collegiate jazz in San Diego jumped on the national map when the San Diego 
State University Jazz Ensemble's CD "Don't Make Noise!" received three out of a 
possible five stars in the December issue of Downbeat, with special praise 
going to alto saxophonists Colin Mason and Art Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
Bob and Gretchen Geib brought good jazz to San Diegans through their Society 
for Straight-ahead Jazz, including a rare performance by former John Coltrane 
bassist Art Davis at Diego's Loft, and another by guitarist and former Padre 
Eric Show in a quintet also featuring local saxman Gary LeFevre, which drew 270 
people to the Salmon House. 
</P>
<P>
Summer outdoor jazz was more available than ever, led by the city of Carlsbad's 
series of nine concerts at neighborhood parks. Who could forget avant-garde 
saxophonist Turiya's performance? In shorts and sunglasses, she looked like a 
tourist as she delivered driving jazz to moms, pops and kids on a warm summer's 
eve with the group Kokopelli.

Holy Heart Attack, Batman!: He smokes. He eats fatty foods. He doesn't 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
And all that stressful crimefighting has taken its toll. Gotham City's 
Commissioner Gordon has a massive heart attack in an issue of Batman comics on 
sale now. The storyline is a joint effort between DC Comics, the publisher of 
Batman, and the American Heart Assn. to educate the public about heart disease. 
In addition, public service advertising about heart disease, featuring the 
character of the commissioner, will appear in other DC comic books this month. 
Will Gordon recover? The heart attack saga will continue in Batman over the 
next few years. BETH KLEID

I Hear a Symphony: Paul McCartney has gone classical. The former Beatle will 
return to his hometown of Liverpool, England, in June for the premiere of his 
first classical composition, "Liverpool Oratorio." 
</P>
<P>
The work is the semi-autobiographical tale of the life of a Liverpool war baby 
and was written with conductor Carl Davis. McCartney won't be part of the 
performance, which will feature Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and about 200 musicians and 
singers when it's performed in Liverpool Cathedral. McCartney says writing the 
piece was challenging because he had no experience in classical music as a 
child. BETH KLEID

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: USIU JOINS LIST OF THEATERS 
IMPERILED BY FINANCIAL ILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
1990 will go down as the year in which the fragility of San Diego's 
often-impressive theater scene was never more in evidence. 
</P>
<P>
And lest any of us forget the fiscal crises of the La Jolla Playhouse, the San 
Diego Repertory Theatre and the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company, one more 
theater ended the year by unveiling its own uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a professional theater like the others, but it serves 5,500 
subscribers -- more than either the Gaslamp or the San Diego Rep. 
</P>
<P>
It's the popular program of United States International University, operating 
at the Theatre in Old Town and the Poway Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
USIU's theater problems are, in part, a matter of overspending on production. 
But the greater burden comes from the university's having just filed for 
bankruptcy, because of an accumulated $14-million in debt in the United States. 
Administrators say the school has an additional $8.5 million in debt in the 
United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
USIU, like theatrical programs at UC San Diego and San Diego State University, 
feeds the larger professional market with talent. USIU students and teachers 
have performed by the dozen on stages at the San Diego Rep and North Coast Rep 
this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
USIU is best known for having sent John Barrowman, a junior, to its London 
campus for its longstanding year-abroad program. But on the way to London, 
Barrowman got sidetracked. He auditioned and was cast as the lead in "Anything 
Goes" on London's West End. This was followed by a lead role in "Miss Saigon," 
which now is not only the hottest show in London, but also the most eagerly 
awaited import to Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it is the same London campus that provided Barrowman a 
steppingstone that might become the solution -- and the sacrificial lamb -- for 
USIU's problems. 
</P>
<P>
The U.K. campus is up for sale for $60 million, which, if sold, could solve the 
school's long-running financial problems in one swoop. 
</P>
<P>
But even if the sale occurs and solvency at last results, the theater program 
will not go back to business as usual, theater professor/director/actor Drew 
Tombrello said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Tombrello, most recently cast as Dutch Schultz in the San Diego Rep's upcoming 
"The Life and Life of Bumpy Johnson," said that we can expect belt-tightening 
at USIU theater, a move he applauds. 
</P>
<P>
"We spent too much money, and our programs had a lot of fat. I don't think many 
of us could last under that decadence," he said, citing a production of "West 
Side Story" that cost upward of $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been assured that our programs will stay intact as long as we can show 
how that cost effectiveness can work. What we're hoping is that in a year or 
two we can come back stronger than we left -- not with a monetary thrust, but 
with an artistic, academic thrust." 
</P>
<P>
Tombrello said with last year's departure of USIU President William Rust, who 
ran the school for 37 years, a greater freedom emerged. 
</P>
<P>
Under Rust, professors and students found themselves limited to light musicals 
from the 1940s and 1950s, Tombrello said. 
</P>
<P>
Under current President Kenneth McLennan, a former Marine Corps general, 
Tombrello was able to direct such shows as "Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and 
Living in Paris" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" 
</P>
<P>
Out of disaster can come growth and change. Out of disaster can also come more 
disaster. Tombrello is optimistic, but knows the theater's future could go 
either way. 
</P>
<P>
"We see it as a beginning rather than an ending. It's going to be tough. We're 
going to lose students. Some will be afraid, and I will tell them, 'If you're 
afraid, don't come.' I know we're going to finish this year. And we'll know 
next fall if it's going to be a program that we all want. 
</P>
<P>
"If it (the theater) falls, I don't think it will fall from without, it will 
fall from within. And we will say, 'Look, the dream is dead, let's all move 
on.' But this could also become the program we always wanted it to be." 
</P>
<P>
Each theater's crisis in 1990 has been unique, sharing mainly a common need for 
community support in increasingly tough economic times. But still, the lessons 
of USIU point to a message worth remembering for all companies heading into an 
uncertain '91. Be willing to make changes -- without them you may indeed die -- 
but don't lose the dream. 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: Loretta Devine, who was a smash in the Old Globe's "Lady Day at 
Emerson's Bar &amp; Grill," will reprise the role she created in George C. 
Wolfe's "The Colored Museum" on KPBS-TV (Channel 15, Cable 12), Feb. 1, 9-10:30 
p.m. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lamb's Players Theatre will present three one-man shows on its National City 
Stage in January: "C.S. Lewis On Stage," Jan. 17-19, "The Revelation of John," 
Jan. 20, and "The Gospel of Mark," Jan. 24-27. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Actors Theatre will produce "American Dreams" by Studs Terkel at 
the Elizabeth North Theatre beginning Feb. 15 for a five-week run. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Moscow Circus will return to the San Diego Sports Arena March 13-17. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mummenschanz, a Swiss mime troupe, will perform at the Spreckels Theatre March 
13 at 7 p.m. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The North Coast Repertory Theatre will produce Athol Fugard's "Blood Knot," the 
story of a white man and a black man in South Africa who share the same mother. 
The show fills a previously open spot in the theater's season schedule. It 
begins April 20 for a six-week run. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Critics Circle Awards will be presented Jan. 28 at Tin Pan Alley, 
but with a difference this year. Instead of putting the spotlight on winners 
(and thus losers), the critics will name honorees with multiple recognitions in 
each category.

SHOPPING: BUDGET ROES FOR CAVIAR DREAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beluga and Sevruga are swell, especially for New Year's. But if these two 
delicacies are beyond your pocketbook, welcome the new year with caviar anyway 
-- budget caviars that cost as little as 57 cents an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
They're the roe of pollock, cod, smelt, herring and flying fish, and you'll 
find them in Japanese and Korean markets. Don't look down on these Oriental 
products as poor cousins to costly sturgeon and salmon roe. They have their own 
personalities. Some taste subtly of sake. And some are so zingy with red pepper 
or Japanese horseradish (wasabi) that you'll be gasping for Champagne or 
whatever cold drink is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
In sushi bars, you may have seen tiny golden grains of smelt roe paired with a 
quail egg atop nori-wrapped rice. Called masago, this roe costs as little as 
$1.99 for 3 ounces. Brilliant orange masago makes a fine topping for a pale 
dip, a bright garnish for a canape or an addition to a spread. Try also topping 
a cucumber slice with a mound of roe, or scatter it over cream cheese that 
you've spread on a cracker, cucumber or zucchini slice. 
</P>
<P>
The brand sampled for this column, packed by Nishimoto Trading Co. of Kobe, was 
mild in flavor and tasted pleasantly of sweet sake. Not all smelt roe products 
are identical, however. Lake smelt roe from the Pacific California Fish Co., 
purchased in a Korean market, had more ocean flavor, and the label listed salt 
as the only seasoning. The price was $4.99 for a 6-ounce tub. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific California also packs flying fish roe -- tobiko -- at $7.50 for a 
6-ounce tub. Salty and a bit sweet from mirin (sweet sake), it is darker in 
color than the smelt roe but can be used in the same fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Salmon roe (ikura) is much more expensive -- $29.99 a pound at Yaohan in Little 
Tokyo. But Yaohan also packs small quantities in disposable blue and white, 
bamboo-patterned trays that can go straight to the table. The price is $2.70. 
</P>
<P>
Two products that require caution are herring roe with horseradish (kazunoko 
wasabi) from Nishimoto Trading Co. and Pacific Giant salted herring roe from 
Korea. The herring roe with horseradish is a smooth green paste that includes 
radish, cucumber, wasabi, sake and roe. The wasabi dominates, and even a small 
taste will send shock waves up your nose. 
</P>
<P>
The Korean salted herring roe looks like red pepper paste, and that's what it 
tastes like. Incredibly hot, it is best used as a spicy condiment. Stir a 
little into soups, sauces or dips that can take a hot touch. But there's more 
to the flavor than red pepper. Garlic and sugar are also blended in. 
</P>
<P>
The least expensive product sampled was the herring roe with horseradish at 
$1.99 for 3.52 ounces. The salted herring roe was $5.99 for a 5.6-ounce jar. 
</P>
<P>
Seasoned pollock roe from Korea, packed by Marukai Corp. of Honolulu, could be 
used straight from the jar as a spread or blended with cream cheese for a 
milder flavor. It's a pasty product with a flavor reminiscent of caviar. Red 
pepper seasons the mixture, but gently. Rice wine, soy sauce, garlic and bonito 
are other ingredients. This was $4.99 for an 8-ounce jar at the California 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Sugar is the second ingredient on the label of seasoned cod fish roe, a 
Japanese product from Showa Marine Inc. However, the taste is only mildly 
sweet. The granules are distinct rather than processed into a paste and would 
look good in a dip. The price was $5.99 for a 3.1-ounce jar. 
</P>
<P>
Other roe products available in Asian markets include one that seems to be 
making a bid for wider acceptance. This is Yamaya's spicy mentai, seasoned 
pollock roe that is touted on the label as "a new Oriental appetizing caviar." 
The price was $4.98 for 8 ounces at Yaohan. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaohan is located at 333 S. Alameda St., Los Angeles, and 2121 W. 182nd St., 
Torrance. Other markets that sell the roe products sampled are Enbun Co., 124 
Japanese Village Plaza Mall, Little Tokyo; Modern Food Market, 332 East 2nd 
St., Little Tokyo; and California Market, a Korean market at 450 S. Western 
Ave., Los Angeles. sg,2

GOOD FOOD: CHESTNUTS BEYOND THE OPEN FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE LAND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As things currently stand, chestnuts are almost as ephemeral as poinsettias. 
From Thanksgiving to Christmas, they're everywhere; then boom, adios until next 
turkey time. There are a number of reasons for this, primary among them the 
fact that the fresh nuts are harvested only once a year. They are also 
expensive. And they're a hassle: You've got to peel a lot to get much food, and 
you've got to peel them while they're hot or the skins will stick. 
</P>
<P>
Dried chestnuts, on the other hand, are a delight all year. They come already 
peeled, they're easy on the budget and they're very easy to eat. Though they 
lack the almost fluffy texture of the fresh article, they do retain the same 
sweetness and classic, addictive, smoky chestnut flavor. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, dried chestnuts might best be seen as a sort of very high-class dried 
bean, just as wild rice is considered a fancier version of rice. The two aren't 
botanically related, but their uses at the table are parallel, and chestnuts, 
like beans, are high in protein and low in fat. 
</P>
<P>
Chestnuts are sweeter than beans, and this must be allowed for, but they do 
beautifully for many classic bean purposes, such as teamed with rice. I 
wouldn't try to make chili with them, but they do make dandy burritos; just 
boil with an onion, mash in a bit of oil or bacon fat, and serve in tortillas 
with lots of shredded lettuce, onions, cheese, hot peppers and other fixings of 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
Chestnuts go well with members of the cabbage family and taste good in beef 
stew. Try them as a garnish for baked squash, or marinate them in vinaigrette 
and sprinkle on the salad. There's no reason for chestnuts to vanish up the 
chimney with Santa; in the dried version they are, or should be, a staple that 
knows no season. 
</P>
<P>
The hardest part is finding them, since they are not generally a supermarket 
item. I get mine at the local co-op; other likely sources are health-food 
stores and groceries that deal in Italian or Mediterranean foods. Once 
purchased, dried chestnuts must be picked over before use, since even the 
finest quality will include three or four wormy ones per pound. Generally, when 
a recipe calls for half a pound of walnuts, buy a generous half-pound. 
</P>
<P>
While it is not absolutely essential to soak them, an eight- to 24-hour bath in 
cool water to cover will help them cook more evenly. It will also loosen those 
last little bits of skin, which can be easily removed with a wood pick. (Do not 
soak longer than 24 hours or they will start to ferment.) Use the soaking water 
as part of the cooking liquid, but otherwise proceed as you would with dried 
beans. 
</P>
<P>
 The fresh, very slightly bitter taste of the celery balances the smoky 
sweetness of the chestnuts, and celery's crispness makes a fine contrast to the 
otherwise smooth puree. Though this tastes as rich as a classic cream soup, 
it's actually very low in fat. Just pleasantly filling, it's ideal for a winter 
lunch or as the main dish of a winter dinner that also includes a substantial 
salad and a loaf of crusty garlic bread. 
</P>
<P>
CHESTNUT AND 
</P>
<P>
CELERY SOUP 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound dried chestnuts 
</P>
<P>
3 cups chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
1 heaping tablespoon butter 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 cups sliced (scant 1/4-inch thick) celery 
</P>
<P>
2 or 3 tablespoons minced celery leaves 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup thinly sliced green onions, including about 1 inch green part 
</P>
<P>
1 cup low-fat milk 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup minced parsley or fennel 
</P>
<P>
4 lemon wedges 
</P>
<P>
Pick over chestnuts. Place in deep bowl and cover generously with cold water. 
Soak 8 to 24 hours. Remove clinging skins with wood pick. 
</P>
<P>
Transfer chestnuts to heavy saucepan. Add 2 cups soaking water and chicken 
broth. Bring liquid to boil. Cover pan and simmer until chestnuts are very 
tender, about 1 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Remove chestnuts with slotted spoon and puree in blender or processor, adding 
just enough cooking liquid to keep grinder from sticking. Keep liquid hot. 
</P>
<P>
Melt butter in clean pan over medium-high heat until sizzling and beginning to 
brown. Add celery, celery leaves and green onions. Raise heat to high and cook, 
stirring, until vegetables are just translucent and starting to brown. 
</P>
<P>
Reduce heat to low. Add chestnut puree and stir well. Slowly stir in broth. Add 
enough milk to achieve good smooth consistency. Heat to desired temperature. 
Season to taste with salt. 
</P>
<P>
Transfer soup to heated bowls. Sprinkle with parsley and serve at once, 
accompanied by lemon wedges. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Marrons Glacees, the huge, soft, sugar-glazed chestnuts imported from France, 
are one of the world's loveliest candies. Unfortunately, they are also one of 
the world's most expensive -- last time I looked, they were running about two 
bucks apiece -- and they cannot be made at home. The bonbons below, however, 
deliver a similar satisfaction at a fraction of the cost, and they are very 
easy to prepare. They make a lovely New Years' Eve present, especially when 
presented in pretty foil or printed paper cases. This recipe can easily be 
doubled. 
</P>
<P>
MOCK MARRONS 
</P>
<P>
GLACEES 
</P>
<P>
(Chestnut Bonbons) 
</P>
<P>
1/4 pound dried chestnuts, about 1/2 cup 
</P>
<P>
1 egg white, beaten just enough to mix 
</P>
<P>
Superfine sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon butter, softened 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
Pick over chestnuts. Place in bowl and cover with 1 1/2 cups cold water. Allow 
to soak 8 to 24 hours, removing skins with wood pick. Place chestnuts and 
soaking liquid in heavy, covered saucepan. Cook over low heat until very 
tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Cool in cooking liquid. 
</P>
<P>
Drain chestnuts well (juice may be saved for adding to soup or stew). Puree in 
blender or food processor with half of egg white, 1 scant tablespoon superfine 
sugar, butter and vanilla until paste is completely smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Line baking sheet with parchment paper or butter lightly. Form chestnut paste 
into balls the size of large grapes, leaving surface little rough if possible. 
One at time, dip balls in remaining egg white and let drain briefly. Roll in 
superfine sugar until thoroughly covered. Set well apart on baking sheet. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 275 degrees 30 minutes, or until sugar shell is set. Check halfway 
through and lower heat if bonbons are browning. (If light gold in color, they 
are still good but white is ideal.) Cool few minutes on sheet. Carefully remove 
and finish cooling on wire racks. Store airtight to prevent sogginess. Makes 
about 20 candies.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This soup is easy to prepare and can be assembled in advance. Mushrooms are 
sauteed with a julienne of leeks and carrots in a small amount of butter and 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the vegetables are simmered in a combination of chicken and beef stocks 
and freshly grated Parmesan cheese is added as a final garnish. 
</P>
<P>
SHIITAKE MUSHROOM 
</P>
<P>

1 1/4 pounds shiitake mushrooms, cleaned 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
3 medium carrots, cut into 3x1/4-inch julienne 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon finely chopped garlic

3/4 cup grated imported Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
Parsley sprigs, preferably flat leaf 
</P>
<P>
Remove roots and green stems from leeks. Wash leeks. Cut into 3x1/4-inch 
julienne (about 3 3/4 cups). Remove stems from shiitake mushrooms. Cut into 
1/4-inch julienne. 
</P>
<P>
Heat butter and oil in large, deep-sided pan or casserole over medium-high 
heat. Add and saute carrots 4 to 5 minutes. Add leeks and saute 3 to 4 minutes 
more. Add garlic, shiitake and cultivated mushrooms and cook, stirring, 5 
minutes.

point. Cool, cover and refrigerate. Reheat over medium heat when ready to 
serve.) 
</P>
<P>
To serve, ladle soup into individual bowls. Garnish each with generous 
tablespoon Parmesan cheese and parsley sprigs. Serve hot. Makes 8 to 10

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: PRIME TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
Real urban steakhouses are becoming rare in Central Los Angeles: places where a 
fellow can get a decent slab of protein without crossing the border into 
Beverly Hills, two-fisted meat-and-martini joints where an account executive 
can blow his Pritikin thing with massive hunks of well-aged sirloin. The 
steakhouse belt just west of Downtown has mostly gone over to pupuserias and 
small Guatemalan restaurants, a bad thing for fans of the Chandleresque. 
Edward's, Vince &amp; Paul's, the Cove and the Bull n' Bush, among other old 
places, have shut down just in the last couple of years. The Pacific Dining Car 
prices its steaks out of the reach of anybody but six-figure businessmen and 
Japanese tourists. Where are the steaks for the common guy? 
</P>
<P>
In the burbs, there are those vast, dark steakhouses decked out with stained 
glass and mirrored beer signs in the Rotary neighborhoods of Pico Rivera or 
Pittsburgh. Those places have Lincolns in their parking lots and hideaway 
corners in their dim, smoky bars, dry Manhattans and soggy slabs of garlic 
cheese toast. A traveling district sales manager knows their floor plans the 
way an 8-year-old instinctively grasps the layout of a new McDonalds. 
</P>
<P>
But Taylor's Prime Steaks -- which is located at the point where Koreatown and 
Little Central America collide, across the street from a raucous Asian 
poolhall, close to Salvadoran bodegas, a block away from Mr. $1 Store -- is a 
real urban steakhouse, one of the last of the dimly lit breed, decked out with 
red-vinyl booths, horsey prints on the walls, and a pickle-nose guy at the bar 
who laughs like Thurston Howell III. Prime, dry-aged steak dinners, complete 
with soup or salad and spud, run about $12 to $16, which is about half of what 
the Beverly Hills places charge. In the '60s, Taylor's was what passed for 
high-style cuisine in Los Angeles, and the entryway is hung with rave reviews 
that are mostly 20 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday times are festive at Taylor's, even beyond the tinsel that spills over 
the bar. Tripping up the stairs into the banquet room, coiffed and lacquered 
Hancock Park matrons look straight ahead, flawless in their full-length minks, 
grimly facing their husbands' office parties. Groups of businessmen float 
toward the door, ties loosened, vests unbuttoned, wearing the sheepish look on 
their faces that says they've been drinking since early afternoon. (During the 
day sometimes, Taylor's seems like the male equivalent of the Bullocks-Wilshire 
Tea Room.) Prep-look nuclear families, headed by ruddy men wearing college 
sweatshirts, slouch on banquettes. A gaggle of arty East Hollywood types seems 
pleased to be drinking martinis in a place like this. I like the bartender's 
way with an Old-fashioned. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's used to be famous for its wine card; it's a thin, eccentric pamphlet 
listing things like '28 first-growth Bordeaux and ancient vintages of La Tache 
alongside bottles of '78 Gallo Cabernet and well-aged generic California 
"Burgundy," mini-verticals of Jordan Cabernet and BV Private Reserve, but the 
wine service is a little unorthodox -- a waitress keeps the tiny wine glasses 
filled right to the rim, and the maitre d' periodically comes by to top them up 
whether you want him to or not. This may not be the place to try that special 
bottle of Latour. 
</P>
<P>
This may not be the place to try shrimp cocktail, either -- the last time I 
tried it, the shrimp hadn't quite thawed in their horseradish-spiked catsup. 
The bread's no good, the clam chowder's gluey, the pea soup has all the charm 
of military rations. The chicken entree is a joke. 
</P>
<P>
The thing to get here, obviously, is steak -- steak and good cottage fries 
(some swear by the baked potato) and an iceberg lettuce salad, which is crisp 
and cold and globbed with just enough blue cheese dressing. The filet-mignon is 
soft, buttery, as rare as you order it, crusted with char; a New York steak is 
beefy and rich. T-bones and Porterhouses come sizzling on metal trays; London 
broil, kind of stewy tasting, comes sliced, with a horseradish-sour cream sauce 
on the side. (You can get horseradish on the side with any steak -- do.) Lamb 
chops are thick and juicy as a Jackie Collins novel. 
</P>
<P>
But the glory of Taylor's is the culotte steak, a softball-shaped prime thing 
cut from the top of the sirloin. All the steaks here may be aged, but the 
culotte is profoundly aged, so much so that the outside can be unpleasantly 
gamy, like high meat. If you order it rare, the interior is scarlet, dripping 
juice, salted with morbidity, marbled with fat, full of the tremendous mineral 
sourness of great meat. It's the steak that time forgot. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor's Prime Steaks, 3361 W. Eighth St., Los Angeles, (213) 382-8449. Open 
Monday-Friday, 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Saturday 4 to 10 p.m., Sunday, 4 to 9 
p.m. Full bar. Valet parking. American Express, Carte Blanche, Diners Club, 
MasterCard, Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $24-$36.

ABOUT WINE: IT WAS A VINTAGE YEAR FOR AMERICAN WINERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wine lovers had good news and bad news in 1990: Some of the best wines ever 
made came on the market, but at some of the highest prices. 
</P>
<P>
It was a year in which sales of Italian wine flourished even though American 
wine consumption dropped. 
</P>
<P>
The year was marked by the federal government's ban on any wine from Europe 
showing traces of the chemical Procymidone, which slowed down imports. And it 
was the year the federal government's infamous label advising women not to 
drink while pregnant and warning that drinking "may cause health problems" 
began appearing on bottles of wine, beer and spirits. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the year the alcoholic beverage industries spent millions to defeat 
California's Prop. 134, which would have raised the tax on wine, beer and 
spirits to fight drug abuse. The measure was handily defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Taxes did rise, however -- for wineries making more than 40,000 cases of wine. 
The Federal excise tax was expected to raise the price of a bottle of wine by 
about 35 cents -- unless producers, upset over declining sales, absorb the tax. 
</P>
<P>
It was a year when James Conaway's important book "Napa" was released, stirring 
the bucolic residents of the nation's most famous wine valley to anger, though 
few paid heed to the environmental message of the author. 
</P>
<P>
This look back on the last 12 months includes my personal selections for the 
best American wines of the year. (Some of these wines may no longer be 
available.) Choosing a best wine in each of these categories was more difficult 
this year than ever -- a tribute to our wine makers and grape growers. 
</P>
<P>
Chardonnay of the Year: 1988 Arrowood ($18) -- Classic flavors of apple, spice 
and pear without an excess of oak or buttery components. A more delicate style 
of wine than some, but one that struck me as being truly an American classic. 
</P>
<P>
Find of the Year: Leonetti Cellars in Walla Walla, Wash., as one of the top 
producers of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the country. Wine maker Gary 
Figgins is a brilliant wine maker whose production is, at present, so small 
he's not widely distributed. But the cognoscenti know. 
</P>
<P>
Merlot of the Year: 1987 Benziger of Glen Ellen ($15) -- Stunningly fruity wine 
with wonderful complexity. 
</P>
<P>
Rhone Type Wine of the Year: 1988 Qupe Syrah ($20) -- Rich with gobs of fruit, 
complex flavors and probable aging potential. 
</P>
<P>
Courageous Wine Maker of the Year: Brian Babcock of Babcock Cellars in 
Buellton. The young man has no fear. He makes dramatically good wines in a most 
unconventional manner and offers small lots of wines that defy description. 
Most are excellent, though a bit pricey. 
</P>
<P>
Rose of the Year: 1989 Joseph Phelps Vin du Mistral Grenache Rose ($9.50) -- 
the most delicious rose I have ever tasted, and it still impresses me, even in 
the dead of winter. It's kind of like popcorn; I defy anyone to try just a 
taste of it and not consume more. 
</P>
<P>
Outraged: Kermit Lynch, the respected Northern California wine importer, 
applied to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for permission to quote 
Thomas Jefferson on his strip label. The quote was: "Wine from long habit has 
become an indispensable for my health." BATF refused to allow the statement, 
saying statements on wine bottles may make no therapeutic claims. Lynch said 
BATF also rejected quotes from the Bible and Louis Pasteur, and he vowed to 
publish quotes about wine in his monthly newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
Sauvignon Blanc of the Year: This was the toughest category for me because of 
the many great 1989s I tasted. I was on the verge of naming the '89 Greenwood 
Ridge, a stunning wine, though I could have named Raymond, Louis Martini, 
Matanzas Creek, Iron Horse, Ferrari-Carano, Duckhorn, DeLoach Fume Blanc, Dry 
Creek, Markham or a half dozen others. The winner, though, is 1989 Spottswoode 
($10.50) -- a faint hint of grass over melon and lime scents leads to a 
complex, creamy texture. The finish is full of fruit and a pure delight. 
</P>
<P>
Truth in Advertising: Chateau Potelle wine maker Jean-Noel Formeaux, mystified 
by two opposing reviews of his 1988 Chardonnay, took out an ad in the Wine 
Spectator headlined, "Read this and get confused." The ad quoted from a Robert 
Parker review of the wine, calling it "bitterly acidic, lean, thin . . . . 
(with) no character and no soul." On a 100-point scale, Parker rated the wine a 
67. The Wine Spectator called the same wine "smooth, concentrated . . . . with 
lively aromas of anise and pear, deep fruit flavors . . . . Delicious" and 
ranked it 88. The ad concluded: "Your taste will never let you down." 
</P>
<P>
Cabernet Sauvignon of the Year: 1985 Caymus Cabernet Special Selection ($50) -- 
Remarkable depth and richness, with a lean and spicy finish to a powerhouse 
wine. It will live a long time, but it's so luscious you want to drink it now. 
This wine beat out the 1986 Beringer Private Reserve, 1985 Shafer Hillside 
Select, 1985 Raymond Reserve and Sterling Reserve -- a sensational crop of 
Cabernets. 
</P>
<P>
Making It "Big": Restaurant Girardet in Crissier, Switzerland, has been called 
the best restaurant in the world -- and sold no California wine. At long last, 
sommelier Francisco Batuello has agreed to offer a few California wines on the 
list. The first chosen: 1988 Chardonnays from Grgich Hills and Cuvaison; 1985 
Grgich Hills Cabernet, 1986 Ridge Geyserville Zinfandel and 1987 Opus One. 
Applause for the Americans -- until you see that the Opus One sells for the 
U.S. equivalent of $250. (Retail price: $55.) 
</P>
<P>
Zinfandel of the Year: 1988 Haywood ($12) -- Again, there were so many 
Zinfandels to choose from (Nalle, Quivira, Kendall-Jackson Mendocino, the 
Terraces, Burgess, Rafanelli, Fetzer Reserve) that it was a tough choice. What 
it came down to, quite simply, was a glass of the Haywood I had with a plate of 
linguine all' arrabbiata. The cherry/raspberry aroma and classic berrylike 
finish were all I needed. 
</P>
<P>
Sparkling Wine of the Year: 1984 Schramsberg Blanc de Noirs ($21) -- Amazingly 
complex wine with a dough or toast component adding richness to the Pinot Noir 
fruit. An elegant cross between California fruit and the depth you get from 
French Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Unclear on the Concept Award: A company is marketing a device intended to 
protect open bottles of sparkling wine from spoilage by spraying a burst of 
nitrogen into the bottle. The problem: The carbonation inside a bottle of 
sparkling wine protects it from spoilage just as well, and if the bubbles are 
all gone, the wine isn't worth saving anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
Wine Gadget of the Year: After you have looked at those $10 stainless things 
that keep the sparkle in a bottle of sparkling wine, look around for those 
little plastic-topped soda bottle stoppers with the rubber gaskets. They do an 
excellent job of keeping in the fizz -- at about 50 cents a copy. 
</P>
<P>
Chenin Blanc of the Year: 1989 Grand Cru ($6.50) -- Melons and pears in an 
off-dry wine. Wonderful with light dishes. 
</P>
<P>
Make No Mistake: The Mario Perelli-Minetti Vineyard and Winery, in the Napa 
Valley, responding to a slew of foreign buyouts of high-image wineries, added 
to its winery sign facing the Silverado Trail on its winery: "American owned." 
</P>
<P>
Pinot Noir of the Year: Tie between 1988 Williams-Selyem "Rochioli Vineyard" 
($30) and Gary Farrell "Howard Allen" ($25). Similarly made wines; the former 
gives more suppleness, the latter more power. Choose your weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Curious Idea of the Year: Chateau St. Jean, which has made a vintage-dated 
sparkling wine since 1980, announced that all sparkling wines from the 1990 
release and thereafter would be non-vintage wines. A winery spokesman said the 
decision was made because marketing people said retailers and restaurants 
complained that having a vintage date identified the wine as to its age and 
"some people felt they didn't want last year's wine." 
</P>
<P>
Gewurztraminer of the Year: 1989 Thomas Fogarty Santa Cruz Mountains ($9) -- 
Classic spice and richness in a nearly dry wine. Perfect for Thai food. 
</P>
<P>
Good Idea of the Year: Because the term Port has been deemed by officials of 
the European Economic Community to be proprietary to wines from Oporto, 
Portugal, those making a Port-type wine elsewhere may not market it in Europe 
labeled Port. So Andy Quady of Quady Winery in Madeira took the "right" 
approach. He is bottling a portion of his Port production for the European 
market and calling the wine Starboard. 
</P>
<P>
Good Idea Runner-Up: Starboard, Quady's excellent 1987 Port, is packed in a 
bottle with a back label that says the wine comes from a vineyard, "planted to 
a mixture of traditional . . . . wine varieties originally imported to 
California from the Douro district of northern Portugal" and that the resulting 
wines "have become associated with . . . . wines." 
</P>
<P>
After Starboard: Since Sherry has been termed legal by the EEC only for wines 
from Jerez, Spain, are we soon to see an American winery call its product 
Cheri? 
</P>
<P>
Semillon of the Year: 1987 Hogue Cellars ($8) -- Marvelous flavors in a wine 
rarely looked on with favor in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Dumb Idea of the Year: Sebastiani, the Sonoma winery that brought us Domaine 
Chardonnay, the wine with no Chardonnay in it, is at it again. The winery has 
released a line of wines under the brand name Swan Cellars. Nice name, except 
that since the late 1960s, the Joseph Swan brand has been a super-premium wine, 
hard to find and in great demand, produced by the late Sonoma County wine 
pioneer. (A lawsuit has been threatened.) 
</P>
<P>
Red Wine Bargain of the Year: 1987 Estancia Meritage ($12) -- Excellent fruit 
(trace of mint among herbs), a faint earthy quality and a price most people 
won't blink at. Wine maker Greg Upton has done a superb job with many wines in 
the last few years, and this is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Unclear on the Concept, Runner-Up: To the marketing people who decided to bring 
into the United States, late in 1990, a tired, over-the-hill, orange-colored 
1987 Chateau Clarke Rose from Bordeaux. At $20 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
Rip-off: The 1990 Nouveau Beaujolais, which came in at prices ($10 to $15 a 
bottle) about double what they had been two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Curiouser and curiouser: The 1990 Beaujolais sold at those prices. Go figure . 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Late Harvest Riesling of the Year: 1988 Fetzer Reserve ($10/half bottle) -- 
Unctuously sweet, but with perfect flavors of honey, peach, pear and apple and 
a spice component in the finish. Next to impossible to take one sip and leave 
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
What's the Point?: Former White House aide G. Gordon Liddy appeared in print 
ads for Chilean wines, saying that Chilean grapevines were not grafted. Huh? 
</P>
<P>
Strange Concept of the Year: Domaine St. George's Blush Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
Stung: International Wine Review, based in Ithaca, N.Y., missed its first issue 
of 1990 after editor Craig Goldwyn announced that a thief broke into the 
company's offices and stole computers and software. Cases of Bordeaux wine that 
were to be evaluated were not touched. By mid-year, the magazine ceased 
publication and was acquired by Wine and Spirits Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Quote of the Year: "If your doctor says that your gout is caused by Port, 
change doctors. If Port doesn't agree with you, you're probably sick. If you're 
sick, you need Port." Dr. Marvin Overton, Ft. Worth, Texas, neurosurgeon and 
wine collector who specializes in Port. 
</P>
<P>
Unquote: Bo Simons, the librarian for the Sonoma County Wine Library, in a 
review in the Healdsburg Tribune of Robert Parker's new 500-plus-pages book 
"Burgundy": "(This new book) which weighs in at over 1,000 pounds . . . ." 
Yeah, but can you put it in your vest pocket?

<P>
1990 Quady Electra -- This low-alcohol (4%) wine from Andy Quady is 100% Orange 
Muscat with a hint of carbonation. 
</P>
<P>
You could drink three glasses and get the alcohol equivalent of just one. It's 
delicious -- sweet, but not too sweet. It's a grand experience -- at $9.50 a 
bottle.

MICROWAVE: RICE CAN BE COOKED IN A MICROWAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since rice takes as long to microwave as to cook the old-fashioned way, you may 
wonder, "Why bother?" 
</P>
<P>
Three good reasons: The rice needn't be started in boiling water, it won't 
stick to the pan or scorch, and it will steam to perfection in a microwave. For 
best results, follow these guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
* To prevent boil-over, use a casserole three times the volume of the rice and 
water placed into it. 
</P>
<P>
* To hasten cooking, use the hottest tap water available. 
</P>
<P>
* To reduce evaporation and keep the rice fluffy-moist, use a tight lid. 
</P>
<P>
* If the rice is to cook evenly, don't add salt until after the rice is done, 
unless you dissolve it completely in the cooking liquid before adding the rice. 
</P>
<P>
* To avoid breaking the individual grains of rice, stir the rice once only. 
</P>
<P>
* To hold microwaved rice 10 to 15 minutes before you serve it, keep it tightly 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
BASIC STEAMED 
</P>
<P>
LONG-GRAIN OR 
</P>
<P>
CONVERTED RICE 
</P>
<P>
1 cup long-grain or converted rice 
</P>
<P>
2 cups water, beef or chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Mix rice and liquid in microwave-safe casserole 3 times volume of combined 
ingredients. Cover with tight lid and microwave on HIGH (100% power) 4 to 6 
minutes until small bubbles appear around edge. 
</P>
<P>
Stir once. Re-cover and microwave on MEDIUM (50% power) 9 to 10 minutes, 
without stirring, until rice is al dente. Rice will seem dry on surface but 
some liquid will remain in bottom of casserole. This will be absorbed as rice 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
Let rice stand, tightly covered, 5 minutes. Add salt to taste and fluff lightly 
with fork. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Variation: 
</P>
<P>
Basic Steamed Brown Rice: Prepare as directed but substitute converted brown 
rice for white rice and increase microwave time on MEDIUM (50% power) to 22 to 
25 minutes. Makes 4 to 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
10 QUICK WAYS 
</P>
<P>
TO JAZZ UP RICE 
</P>
<P>
(All amounts based on 1 cup uncooked rice. Always adjust salt to taste. All 
make 4 to 6 servings.) 
</P>
<P>
Onion-Mushroom Rice: Microwave 1/2 cup minced onion in 1 tablespoon butter or 
margarine in wax-paper-covered, microwave-safe casserole on HIGH (100% power) 3 
minutes before adding rice and liquid. Proceed as directed, adding 1 cup thinly 
sliced or coarsely chopped mushrooms before microwaving on MEDIUM (50% power). 
</P>
<P>
Curried Rice: Add 1 tablespoon butter or margarine and 2 teaspoons curry powder 
to chicken broth and uncooked rice, then microwave as directed. 
</P>
<P>
Saffron Rice: Blend 1/8 teaspoon powdered saffron with cooking liquid before 
adding rice, then microwave as directed. 
</P>
<P>
Garlic-Sour Cream Rice: Microwave 1 minced garlic clove along with rice. After 
standing time, fork in 3/4 cup room-temperature sour cream and 2 tablespoons 
minced chives. Cover with lid and microwave on MEDIUM 2 minutes to warm and 
blend flavors. 
</P>
<P>
Green Rice: Add 1/2 cup minced green onions (include some green tops) and 1 
tablespoon butter to chicken broth and uncooked rice. Microwave as directed, 
then stir in 1 cup minced parsley just before serving. 
</P>
<P>
Herbed Rice: Mix 2 tablespoons minced fresh basil, dill, chives or parsley or 1 
tablespoon minced fresh sage or thyme with 2 tablespoons melted butter or 
margarine and fork into cooked rice before standing time. If fresh herbs are 
unavailable, substitute 1 teaspoon each dried, but crumble well first. Stir 
again lightly and serve. 
</P>
<P>
Cheddar Rice: Before rice stands, add (but do not mix in) 1/2 to 2/3 cup 
shredded sharp Cheddar, Swiss, mozzarella or Jack cheese. Mix in lightly just 
before serving. 
</P>
<P>
Mandarin Orange Rice: Microwave rice in half-and-half mixture of orange juice 
and chicken broth. Before serving, mix in 1 tablespoon butter or margarine, 2 
teaspoons finely grated orange zest and 2 tablespoons minced parsley. Garnish 
with mandarin orange segments. 
</P>
<P>
Fruit Rice: Toss seasoned, cooked rice with 1/3 cup seedless raisins or dried 
currants, diced dried apricots, pitted prunes or dates, figs or apples. 
</P>
<P>
Nut Rice: Toss 1/3 cup coarsely chopped nuts (any kind) and 2 tablespoons 
melted butter with cooked rice. 
</P>
<P>
Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.

CHEF'S SECRETS: AIRY-LIGHT APPLE STRUDEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The desserts of Chef Elmer Azuma of the Sakana Club in West Los Angeles are 
full of surprises, and the strudel found on the restaurant's Franco-Japanese 
menu is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
Azuma uses filo dough in a lot of his desserts. Maybe he picked up the habit in 
France, where he prepared more than his share of strudel dough. (Azuma began 
his cooking career at the age of 14 and worked at several of France's top 
restaurants, including Trois Marche and Le Petite Bedon. In Los Angeles he's 
cooked at Le Petit Chaya, Cafe Katsu, Truffles and his own Chabuya.) 
</P>
<P>
Azuma's strudel is airy light. He uses panko -- crumbs made by toasting 
Japanese white bread -- as a filler, and a light sprinkling of raisins. Apples, 
cinnamon and cardamom go into the filling, but they are used sparingly. 
Calvados cream, a version of creme Anglaise with Calvados for fragrance, naps 
the dish. 
</P>
<P>
SAKANA APPLE 
</P>
<P>
STRUDEL 
</P>
<P>
2/3 cup currants or raisins 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
1/4 cup melted butter 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon panko bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom 
</P>
<P>
1 to 2 apples, peeled, cored and thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
Calvados Cream 
</P>
<P>
Raisin Mousse 
</P>
<P>
Soak currants in rum to cover. Brush one side of each filo sheet with melted 
butter. 
</P>
<P>
Stack filo sheets and sprinkle 1 tablespoon sugar, bread crumbs, cinnamon, 
cardamom and 1/3 cup of drained currants over filo, reserving remaining 1/3 cup 
currants for sauce. Spread sliced apples across 3-inches from bottom of filo 
sheet. Sprinkle some of rum from currants and lemon juice over apples. 
</P>
<P>
Fold filo dough over to make 3-inch hem. Brush exposed filo dough with some of 
remaining butter and sugar. Continue folding over and brushing newly exposed 
surface with more butter and sugar until strudel is completely rolled. Place on 
baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees 20 to 25 minutes or until strudel is brown 
and crisp. Slice and serve slices over Calvados Cream and top with Raisin 
Mousse. Makes 4 to 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Calvados Cream 
</P>
<P>
4 egg yolks 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 cup milk 
</P>
<P>
1 vanilla bean 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons to 1/4 cup Calvados or to taste 
</P>
<P>
Beat egg yolks and sugar in top of double boiler over hot water with wire 
whisk. Heat milk with vanilla bean but do not boil. Discard vanilla bean and 
gradually add half heated milk to egg mixture, whisking constantly. 
</P>
<P>
Stir remaining milk into egg mixture. Cook and stir over low-simmering water 
until milk mixture is thickened to light custard. Cool, then add Calvados. 
Makes 1 1/2 cups. 
</P>
<P>
Raisin Mousse 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup rum-soaked currants 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
Place currants in blender and blend until pureed. Beat whipping cream until 
peaks form. Fold into raisin puree. Makes 1 cup.

AMERICA'S BEST: REAL BACON

If bringing home the bacon isn't as easy as it used to be, maybe you are 
bringing home the wrong bacon. 
</P>
<P>
These days, most bacon that you buy seems to be all fat. When it's cooked, it 
shrivels into almost nothing until you are left with a pan full of grease. 
</P>
<P>
The bacon from the Corralitos Sausage Co. is different. For more than 30 years, 
this small Central California company has been using Pajaro Valley apple wood 
to slow-smoke beef and pork. Lean and lightly salted, their bacon is smoked 
naturally, with no additives and none of that artificial maple flavor you so 
often find. 
</P>
<P>
Fry up a few slices, and the smoky scent of the apple wood will fill up your 
kitchen. You'd swear you were sitting in front of a roaring fire in an alpine 
log cabin. But at $3.29 a pound, the bacon is a lot less expensive than a trip 
to the mountains. The bacon freezes beautifully, so it's best to save on 
postage and order several pounds at once. Shipping charges on five pounds of 
bacon run $5.60. KATHIE JENKINS

THE BUTCHER: MENUDOMANIA: CURE FOR THE NEW YEAR'S BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE ELLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As we usher in the New Year, there's always a good bit of overindulgence. 
Parties, festivities, bashes: Call them what you will, 'tis the time for them, 
and unfortunately the morning after inevitably follows. In Mexico they call 
them paranda -- a night out on the town -- and they have a cure -- menudo. 
</P>
<P>
I first tasted menudo and felt its sobering effects at Al Williams' Papagayo 
Room in San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel in the early 1950s. The Papagayo Room 
was the place to go in those days after a night on the town. Williams had "the 
cure." 
</P>
<P>
Menudo is made from tripe, the lining of the stomach of beef animals, which may 
be why it does such a good job of lining ours against the effects of too much 
paranda. Tripe needs long soaking before cooking and lots of time over low heat 
in the cooking process, but the rewards are well worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
The best tripe for any dish, and the one Williams recommended for menudo, is 
honeycomb tripe. It is the lining of the second stomach of cattle and it 
actually looks like a honeycomb. Some tripe is smooth and requires more cooking 
time to tenderize. 
</P>
<P>
Tripe has an additional plus -- price. Tripe still qualifies as inexpensive 
compared to other cuts of meat. So whether it's for soothing the stomach or the 
pocketbook, try tripe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 I like my tripe still a bit on the chewy side, but it can be cooked longer 
until tender, or even mushy, if you prefer. 
</P>
<P>
MENUDO -- SONORA 
</P>
<P>
STYLE 
</P>
<P>
3 pounds honeycomb tripe 
</P>
<P>
2 pig's feet 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic, crushed 
</P>
<P>
2 bay leaves 
</P>
<P>
1 large onion, diced or sliced thin 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 to 2 sprigs mint, optional 
</P>
<P>
2 jalapeno chiles, optional 
</P>
<P>
1 large can white hominy, drained 
</P>
<P>
Condiments: dried oregano, chopped onion, lemon wedges, dried chile flakes 
</P>
<P>
Cut tripe in 1-inch squares. Soak in salted water several hours or overnight. 
Rinse and drain. 
</P>
<P>
Add tripe to 6 cups boiling salted water in large saucepan. Return to boil. 
Reduce heat and skim. Add pig's feet, garlic, bay leaves and onion. Season to 
taste with salt and pepper. Add mint and jalapeno chiles, if desired. Cover and 
simmer 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until tripe is done to taste. 
</P>
<P>
Remove bay leaves, chiles and mint. Add hominy and simmer 15 minutes longer. 
Adjust seasoning to taste. Serve in large bowls with small bowls of condiments. 
Makes about 10 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 For those of you who on occasion may have the head, but not the stomach, for 
tripe, there is another dish Williams said will serve and soothe as well. It is 
pork and hominy stew -- Pozole. 
</P>
<P>
POZOLE 
</P>
<P>
1 pound pork neck bones 
</P>
<P>
2 quarts chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup chopped onion 
</P>
<P>
3 or 4 cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
3 pounds pork shoulder butt, cut in 1-inch cubes 
</P>
<P>
6 ounces dried California chiles (about 12 pods) or 6 tablespoons chili powder 
</P>
<P>
2 cups white hominy 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
Condiments: chopped onions, dried oregano, lemon wedges, sliced radishes 
</P>
<P>
Salsa Picante 
</P>
<P>
Shredded lettuce 
</P>
<P>
Combine neck bones with chicken broth, onion and garlic in kettle over medium 
heat. Bring to boil. Cover and simmer about 2 hours. Remove neck bones and when 
cool enough to handle, cut meat from bones. Return meat to kettle. Add pork 
cubes. Cover and continue cooking 45 minutes or until pork is tender. 
</P>
<P>
Remove seeds and veins from dried chiles. Soak in boiling water about 20 
minutes. Drain and puree in blender or put through sieve. 
</P>
<P>
Add pureed chiles (or chili powder) and hominy. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper. Cook 15 minutes. Adjust seasoning to taste. Serve in bowls, with 
condiments. Makes 8 to 10 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 This cold hot sauce is traditional with almost all Mexican food, or as a dip 
with tostaditas. It will keep in a jar in the refrigerator for about a week. 
</P>
<P>
Salsa Picante 
</P>
<P>
3 jalapeno, serrano or waxed green chiles, fresh or canned 
</P>
<P>
2 tomatoes, diced 
</P>
<P>
1/2 onion, diced 
</P>
<P>
1 squeeze lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon chopped cilantro 
</P>
<P>
Remove stem ends from chiles. If using fresh jalapenos, remove most of white 
seeds and stem ends. (The more seeds and veins left in, the hotter the sauce. 
Be sure to wash your hands in cold water immediately after handling chiles.) 
</P>
<P>
Chop chiles fine, scraping all chiles and chile oil off cutting board into 
bowl. Add tomatoes, onion, lemon juice and olive oil. Season to taste with salt 
and pepper. Chill. Just before serving, sprinkle with chopped cilantro. Makes 6 
servings.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST

<TEXT>
<P>
An unidentified man was found stabbed to death in the hallway of a downtown San 
Diego hotel Wednesday morning, the third homicide victim in three days within a 
five-block area. 
</P>
<P>
The three killings are not believed to be related, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police found the body of the man on the second floor of a hotel in the 1400 
block of K Street shortly before 4 p.m., said Lt. Dan Berglund. The man was 
described as Latino, between 15 and 20 years old and wearing a satiny-blue 
jacket, blue work pants, white socks and black shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police they saw four men break into the hotel through a 
second-floor window, apparently in search of drugs, earlier that morning, 
Berglund said. 
</P>
<P>
"Witnesses heard what sounded like a struggle and arguing, and what sounded 
like a fight" before the stabbing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, 67-year-old Prospero Francis was found beaten and stabbed to death 
in a downtown hotel room in the 500 block of 12th Avenue, where he had lived 
for the past 30 years, police said. His room had been ransacked, leading police 
to believe the motive was robbery. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Gilberto Torres, 25, was found shot to death on a sidewalk in the 
1600 block of Island Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Berglund said the the slayings are not connected. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no similarities," he said. "There is really no connection." 
</P>
<P>
The Christmas morning shooting happened after an argument, according to 
witnesses, and although a motive has not been established in the Wednesday 
morning slaying, a different weapon -- a knife -- was used, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police are still investigating the three cases and have made no arrests.

<P>
A woman was arrested Wednesday after police found explosives and bomb-making 
equipment in her East San Diego home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Alicia Villarreal, 23, was booked into County Jail downtown on suspicion of 
possessing a destructive device and on a variety of other charges, including 
outstanding warrants, said Sgt. Fred England. 
</P>
<P>
Her bail was set at $10,250. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, police responded to a disturbance call at Villarreal's home in the 
4000 block of 45th Street and came across information that led them to suspect 
there "might be dynamite and automatic weapons there," England said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before serving the search warrant at 12:20 a.m., police arrested Mark 
David Gorence, 23, for carrying a small bomb in his backpack, England said. 
Police linked Gorence to Villarreal's home, prompting them to draw up the 
warrant, England said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorence was booked into County Jail downtown on suspicion of possessing a 
destructive device, England said. 
</P>
<P>
During the search, police found a vial of liquid mercury and bomb-making 
equipment, England said. Officers also found a sawed-off shotgun and a sword 
that looked like a cane when sheathed.

MATER DEI CONTINUES TO ROLL

<P>
Those who predicted that Mater Dei High School would become the best boys' 
basketball team in Orange County by the end of January may have been a month 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (7-3) continued to show improvement since its disappointing 
performance in the Trabuco Hills tournament two weeks ago, defeating Laguna 
Beach, 83-51, Wednesday in the Orange Holiday Tournament at Chapman College's 
Hutton Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs rolled to their fifth victory in the past six games. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, the game matched the smallest public high school in the county against 
the best collection of all-stars this side of Artesia High. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight did his best to downplay his 
team's victory, even calling a timeout early in the first quarter with the 
Monarchs leading, 9-2, to scold his team for a few defensive lapses. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, McKnight said the Monarchs have improved because of better perimeter 
shooting by guards J.J. Ballesteros, Reggie Geary and DeJuan Matthews and the 
inside play of center Terence Wilborn. 
</P>
<P>
"Earlier, we were thinking instead of reacting," McKnight said. "When we lost 
two games at Trabuco Hills, I couldn't walk the streets of Mission Viejo 
without someone asking me, 'What's wrong?' I can only use the excuse of 
inexperience for so long." 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach (5-4) managed to keep the game respectable by making five 
three-point shots, but the Artists' top player, Josh Borrella, was never a 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
Borrella picked up his fourth foul with 4:56 remaining in the third quarter and 
his team trailing, 49-30. He fouled out with 5:40 left to play, finishing with 
12 points, 16 below his season average. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei forward Jason Janeski was the benefactor of some fine passes by Geary 
and point guard Kamran Sufi, converting layups for most of his 22 points. 
Janeski had 20 points in the first half and missed only one shot. 
</P>
<P>
Wilborn has played the biggest role in Mater Dei's turnaround. He had 13 points 
and 10 rebounds Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Terence has given us a lift," McKnight said. "Every game, he gains more 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley 76, Carlsbad 41 -- Center Brett McCorkle scored 25 points and 
had 16 rebounds to lead Capistrano Valley (11-1). McCorkle had 17 points in the 
first half as the Cougars built a 37-20 lead. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Morse 92, Saddleback 88 (OT) -- Forwards Darnell Cherry and Maurice 
Vickers scored four points each in the three-minute overtime period to lead San 
Diego Morse. 
</P>
<P>
Orange 70, Orange Lutheran 53 -- Three-year starting guard Carlos Duran scored 
19 points and teammate Thu Huynh added 18 for Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy 65, Long Beach Wilson 60 -- Junior center Jermaine Galloway scored 26 
points and guard Brian Cline added 17 to lead Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara 56, Fountain Valley 38 -- Junior forward Isiah Mustafa scored 20 
points to lead Santa Clara (11-2).

<P>
REASONS TO HOPE; 
</P>
<P>
TERRIFIC SEAFOOD CHOWDER, CHEESECAKE AND SWORDFISH SANDWICHES. AND A GREAT 
VIEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It has great views and the atmosphere is sort of 1950s cozy and the people who 
serve you are cordial and professional. Which is why I wanted the food at the 
Pier Fish House to be better -- better than it really is. 
</P>
<P>
So I kept going back. It's situated at the foot of the Ventura Fishing Pier and 
in the daytime, no matter where you're sitting -- inside or outside on the 
sheltered deck -- you have a great view. In one direction you can watch the 
volleyball games taking place on the sand; in the other you can watch the 
surfers testing the waters. It's such a really good-feeling place to spend an 
afternoon -- or an evening -- that I thought it might be worth spending time 
trying to find the best dishes on the menu. And there are a few. 
</P>
<P>
But I should have known it wouldn't be easy. When a place has been around since 
1952 (although the present operators have run it for only the past 10 years), 
and you find yourself almost alone on a Saturday night . . . There it was, the 
prime dinner hour, and we were almost the only ones watching that incredible 
view of lights glistening up and down the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Until this particular evening, the meals on the pier had been about 50-50. The 
fried calamari rings and chips for lunch one day had been tough -- definitely 
on the down side of the difference between tough and chewy -- even the breading 
was without distinction. On another day the swordfish sandwich, about 
three-quarters of an inch thick, was obviously fresh, and the only problem in 
eating this juicy, perfectly cooked version was to keep it from falling apart 
in your hands. The fries with it were, unfortunately, the mealy sort. 
</P>
<P>
There also turned out to be a dichotomy in the soups. The New England clam 
chowder was so clumsily thickened that it was filled with unpleasant little 
globs of flour. But the zesty seafood soup was another sort of chowder -- 
tomato-based and filled with fresh fish and fresh vegetables. It's the perfect 
thing for these cold days. 
</P>
<P>
Every time I have a good dish here I get hopeful -- and then my hopes are 
dashed. One night I went for broke and ordered something called the Captain's 
Combo; at $21.95 it is far and away the most ambitious listing. Billed as "4 
prawns, 4 scallops, 4 calamari strips and 4 oz. cod," it comes either broiled 
or "deep-fried to perfection." I chose broiled -- and discovered that the 
perfection part must be reserved for the fried version. There was plenty on 
those two skewers, but it looked as if they had been broiled all together, all 
at once -- and all too long. I wasn't very impressed by the "spicy" Mexican 
prawn cocktail that preceded the combo either. There was plenty of it -- but 
the name was somewhat deceptive. I liked the tomatoey sauce with its 
interestingly crunchy quality, but it turned out to contain very little spice. 
Worse, the cocktail was only about a third Mexican prawns -- the other 
two-thirds were those little bay shrimp, which a dedicated shrimp lover like 
myself can do without. On the other hand, I was very pleased with another 
appetizer, a dish of mushrooms sauteed in wine and garlic; it turned out to be 
one of the dishes worth ordering here. 
</P>
<P>
Other dishes worth ordering? All of the desserts. When I was told that they 
were made by one of the waitresses, I couldn't help thinking that perhaps they 
should ask her to do the fish too. In any case, her Dutch apple cheesecake is 
worth a trip to the pier. The word "chewy" is appropriate, as it is for the 
plain cheesecake -- a sort of New York-style model flooded with a boysenberry 
sauce, crammed with berries and very worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Seafood chowder, a swordfish sandwich, terrific cheesecake. . . and a great 
view. On top of that, the Fish Pier House has Heineken's on tap.

<P>
Of all the ocean's delicacies -- lobster, salmon, caviar and the like -- 
abalone, is the favorite of many gourmet seafood enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
And it isn't just the meat of this shelled mollusk that makes it so prized. The 
ear-shaped armor is the basis for mother-of-pearl jewelry and gift items that 
can be found in seaside communities the world over. 
</P>
<P>
The abalone's popularity has just about done it in. Over-harvesting, coupled 
with pollution, has vastly decreased abalone numbers in our waters over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
A Port Hueneme marine biologist took notice of the decline. 
</P>
<P>
With the hope of bolstering populations, Jim McMullen created a laboratory that 
would farm abalone for the purpose of transplanting them to the deep blue. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how Ab Lab originally started," manager Michael Machuzak said. "Sixteen 
years ago it was a small project to provide for reseeding." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Ab Lab, located on the Naval Civil Engineering Base in Port Hueneme, has 
branched out. Though they continue to supply the Department of Fish and Game 
with occasional seed abalone, Ab Lab's customers now include restaurateurs and 
anyone else wanting to purchase the seafood treat. 
</P>
<P>
"We produce the red abalone," Machuzak said, "which is the fastest growing and 
easiest to farm." There are about eight varieties of abalone that can be found 
along the California coast, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ab Lab's culture methods allow it to produce annually upwards of 3 million seed 
abalone. 
</P>
<P>
The propagation starts with spawning. 
</P>
<P>
Immersed in seawater-filled tanks, each female blows millions of pinhead-sized 
eggs through a small respiratory pore in its shell. "The eggs shoot right 
through," Machuzak said. 
</P>
<P>
Eggs gathered, Ab Lab then bathes them in a wash of male sperm, collected 
through a procedure that induces release. 
</P>
<P>
"In the wild, the male simply broadcasts his sperm over the eggs," he said, 
"whereas our method eliminates the by-chance fertilization." 
</P>
<P>
Machuzak said wild abalone "are lucky to fertilize even 1% of the eggs." Ab 
Lab's technique, he said, ensures about a 30% survival rate. 
</P>
<P>
A remarkably short 24 hours later, eggs that were fertilized begin to hatch. 
"The larvae look like little round, light or dark green circular things with 
cilia," he said. The cilia -- rhythmically beating, hairlike growths -- provide 
the larvae locomotion. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the ability to swim for seven days," he said. And after just two 
days, the larvae "have a shell that looks like that of a garden snail." 
</P>
<P>
After the larvae's seven-day frolic, they are moved to one of Ab Lab's 700 
60-gallon tanks, each holding 30,000 to 50,000 larvae. 
</P>
<P>
"When they reach 10 millimeters, they're either sold to other growers or 
allowed to grow another 28 months in our tanks," Machuzak said. Ab Lab sells to 
other wholesalers and restaurants across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
It will take the red abalone about 3 years to grow 3 inches, or "roughly an 
inch a year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Abalone, "sea snails," have basic eyes that sense light and a snout, Machuzak 
said, and feed on kelp and brown algae. "Their mouth is like a raspy tongue, 
sort of like a cat's, and they just munch away on the kelp." 
</P>
<P>
Ab Lab sells its red abalone to the wholesale and retail seafood markets upon 
reaching two sizes; 2 1/4- and 2 3/4-inches. 
</P>
<P>
The legal size to take red abalone in the ocean is 7 3/4-inches, Machuzak said, 
"but it just takes too long to culture that large." 
</P>
<P>
Bad luck for the poor little devil who ends up covered in lemon butter sauce 
when still so young, but Machuzak reminded us, "The sale of cultured abalone 
doesn't endanger the depleted wild stock." 
</P>
<P>
Most chefs, as well as retail customers, prefer the smaller sizes anyway, he 
said, because they are more tender and easier to handle during preparation. 
</P>
<P>
"Restaurateurs also like to have farmed product," Machuzak said, "because it's 
a more reliable source, whereas fishermen are dependent upon such things as 
weather conditions that can hamper their daily take." 
</P>
<P>
Ab Lab, the only one of its kind in Southern California, takes requests for its 
cultured abalone via telephone and offers only live-in-shell product. "There's 
no processing," Machuzak said, "it's never frozen." 
</P>
<P>
The abalone can be specially packaged and shipped to the customer. "Red abalone 
is about $2.25 per piece," he said. Tours of the facility are conducted 
occasionally. For more information, call 488-6137.

HEALTHIER WINES; 
</P>
<P>
MORE SMALL WINERIES ARE RELEASING VINTAGES MADE FROM ORGANICALLY GROWN GRAPES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
This week I got to thinking about the popular drinking toast, "To your health." 
I'm a fan of California wines and I wondered if pesticides and toxins had found 
their way into that area of life. There's good news and bad news -- good about 
small California wineries, and just bad news about jug wines. 
</P>
<P>
First, the good news. It seems my favorite winery, Fetzer, will release several 
vintages grown from strictly organic grapes -- no pesticide residue -- in a few 
months. But there is no need to wait until after New Year's, since the family 
of 10 brothers and sisters who make their wines already use methods that 
minimize sulfites and other preservatives. 
</P>
<P>
If you must have an absolutely environmentally orthodox New Year's Eve, you can 
buy the product of three wineries. Frey, Bell Rose and Briceland are already 
releasing vintages from organically grown grapes, but they are hard to find 
locally. 
</P>
<P>
Using organically grown grapes is a new approach to winemaking in California 
and the public hasn't grown accustomed to the slight taste differential. Such 
was the case 20 years ago when many independent wineries such as Fetzer and 
Ridge started making non-additive-laced vintages. I used to have to order them 
personally from the vineyard and have the cases delivered to my home, until 
local wine stores began carrying them. Now, things have improved to the point 
where major wine dealers such as Best Buy Wines in Camarillo can stock the 
vintages of 200 different California wineries. The little wineries take extra 
care in the manufacturing process and do not use as many preservatives. 
</P>
<P>
Use of organically grown grapes is widening in California. Buena Vista will be 
competing with Fetzer by late '91 and, according to knowledgeable wine merchant 
Tim Coles of Thousand Oaks, in Paso Robles "one of the great wineries of the 
world, Chateau Beaucastel, is going into major production of wine from organic 
grapes." Coles will sell you a bottle for $12, which is a pretty good price for 
a great wine, and you can get a taste of the future of California wines. 
</P>
<P>
Both Glenn Sanders of Best Buy and Coles of Conejo Wine and Provisions are 
frequently asked whether or not their wines have artificial preservatives. 
Their customers, they said, "should really be asking about whether the grapes 
are organic," said Coles. Natural preservatives will form as part of the 
fermentation process even with organically grown grapes, and in any case they 
dissipate naturally after five years in the bottle. Sanders told me that 
brand-name peanut butter has more preservatives than a good California wine. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, according to Earl Mindell, author of "The Vitamin Bible" and 
"Unsafe At Any Meal," is that the jug wine manufacturers are not interested in 
aging. They fool around with the natural fermentation process by adding sulfur 
dioxide, which can cause headaches and allergic reactions. 
</P>
<P>
Mindell lists in precise detail the findings of the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest with regard to the preservative content of the major jug wines. 
Of course any wine that is inbibed to excess will cause problems, whether there 
is sulfur dioxide or not. The particular problem, in fact, is called a 
hangover. 
</P>
<P>
In this connection, I want to end by quoting Glenn Sanders, who said that the 
most important ingredient in my story "won't be listed on the label of the 
bottle." 
</P>
<P>
"What's that?" I asked, and he replied, "The name of the designated driver." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FYI 
</P>

<P>
A LESSON LEARNED; 
</P>
<P>
JOANNE O'ROARKE AND HOPE BRYANT BECAME PUBLISHERS WHEN BIG COMPANIES SEEMED 
DISINTERESTED IN THEIR WORKS FOR CHILDREN.

Everyone remembers the English folk tale about the little red hen: As she went 
through her day's work in the farmyard she asked each of the animals to help 
her do the chores. No one would help. " 'Then I'll do it myself,' said the 
Little Red Hen. And she did." 
</P>
<P>
Launched only six years ago, the Red Hen Press has become a successful 
children's book publishing company and it is no coincidence that co-publishers 
Joanne O'Roarke and Hope Slaughter Bryant chose the name they did. Both had 
been unsuccessful in trying to interest big publishers in their work. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided, why should giant conglomerates like Doubleday and Random House make 
all the decisions about what children are going to read in the future?" said 
O'Roarke. 
</P>
<P>
"Hope had written a delightful children's book, 'Plato's Fine Feathers'; my 
nephew David Shearer wanted to illustrate children's literature, so I decided I 
would become a publisher myself." 
</P>
<P>
"Plato's Fine Feathers" a four-color picture book, bore the logo of the smugly 
smiling little red hen. It was an enormous success. 
</P>
<P>
"When I held it in my hands," Bryant said, "I cherished the feel of it, the 
smell of it. I turned it over and over, and I said, "This is what I want to 
do.' My husband and his friends would say 'Books will become obsolete. 
Everything will be on microfilm.' Well, a child can't curl up with a piece of 
microfilm!" 
</P>
<P>
In January the company will bring out "A Cozy Place," written by Bryant and 
illustrated by Susan Torrance; and "A Feather for Emily," written and 
illustrated by Barbara Sawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Although these two new works represent only the 11th and 12th Red Hen books, 
the company has an impressive number of successes. 
</P>
<P>
The picture book "Extraordinary Chester" will go into its second printing in 
the spring. Last year it was the finalist for the prestigious Benjamin Franklin 
Award, given annually by the Publishers Marketing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Another book, "A Sky for Henry," has been chosen by the Braille Institute for 
national distribution. 
</P>
<P>
But Red Hen's greatest success so far has been in launching author Lee Wardlow. 
</P>
<P>
"We published her first book, 'Me Plus Math Equals Headache,' in 1986 and her 
sequel 'The Eye and I' in 1988. National Scholastic Books has just brought out 
'The Eye and I' as a weekly reader and with a run of 80,000 copies," O'Roarke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wardlow, a former elementary school teacher, has since acquired an agent and 
published books with Avon and Silhouette Books. 
</P>
<P>
Now a full-time writer, she has three books coming out in the next year. One of 
them, "My Mother's on the Roof," will be published next fall by Red Hen. 
</P>
<P>
To what do Bryant and O'Roarke attribute the success of Red Hen Press? 
</P>
<P>
"We like to think of ourselves as a launching path," Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at an author's and an illustrator's work for itself, rather than at 
the person's credits. We don't depend on the press for our income so we can 
afford, unlike the big companies, to approach the work as an art."

FRACTION OF INDIAN BLOOD WORTH MILLIONS IN BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: CRITICS CITE 1/64TH-CHEROKEE CONTRACTOR AS EXAMPLE OF ABUSES, LAXITY 
IN PROGRAM FOR MINORITY FIRMS.

<P>
Joining the Cherokee Nation has been worth millions of dollars in construction 
work to Jon McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
The blue-eyed, fair-skinned contractor from Tulsa, Okla., who is 1/64 American 
Indian, has obtained $19 million in minority subcontracts on the rapid transit 
system in Los Angeles -- more than any other "disadvantaged" firm. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath's Cherokee ancestry is the equivalent of having a 
great-great-great-great-grandparent who was a full-blooded Indian. But it 
allowed him to gain membership in the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and to 
subsequently obtain certification for McGrath Construction Corp. as a minority 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Such certification -- granted by government agencies across the country -- made 
McGrath's company eligible for lucrative public works subcontracts meant for 
disadvantaged businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The McGrath case, critics say, is an example of how the federal goal of 
bringing minority contractors into the white-dominated construction industry is 
being subverted. The case also shows that Los Angeles transit officials 
sometimes are unaware of important regulations governing the certification of 
disadvantaged companies. 
</P>
<P>
The Times has found that firms with questionable minority status and companies 
serving as alleged "fronts" for non-minority businesses have won tens of 
millions of dollars in subcontracts on the rapid transit system under 
construction in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath's minority status has been repeatedly disputed by a Los Angeles-area 
labor union, and now the prime contractor who gave McGrath millions of dollars 
in public works contracts is "uncomfortable" with the fact that McGrath is only 
1/64 American Indian. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath says that he is a bona fide minority entitled to contracts that he has 
obtained as the owner of a "disadvantaged business enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
Jon Michael McGrath's claim of minority standing hinges on an unusual clause in 
the constitution of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma. Under the clause, anyone 
who can trace an ancestor to Cherokee tribal rolls at the turn of the century 
can join the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, the son of a railroad contractor, joined the Cherokee Nation in 1981 
at the age of 22 after showing proof that a grandmother who was 1/16 Indian 
ancestry had been on the rolls. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he had joined the tribe at that time, McGrath replied: "That was a 
turning point in my life. . . . It was time to start being responsible." 
</P>
<P>
When McGrath joined the Cherokee Nation, he was vice president and 25% owner of 
Railroad Contractors Inc., which that year had applied for certification as a 
minority firm, according to Oklahoma state Department of Transportation 
records. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear what happened to that application for minority certification. But 
3 1/2 years later, in November, 1984, the McGrath Construction Corp. was formed 
with Jon McGrath as president. The company was subsequently certified as a 
minority firm by public works agencies across the country. 
</P>
<P>
These certifications made McGrath eligible to receive minority subcontracts 
from large non-minority prime contractors that bid on public works jobs. 
Federal regulations require that prime contractors seeking public works 
contracts make "good faith" efforts to hire minority firms as subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
During the last six years, Herzog Contracting Corp. of St. Joseph, Mo., has 
used McGrath Construction Corp. as a minority subcontractor on public works 
jobs in Los Angeles County, San Diego County, Santa Clara County, Sacramento, 
Portland, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog was awarded a total of more than $180 million, and McGrath was awarded 
$28.6 million in minority subcontracts, public records show. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath, whose business headquarters is a trailer on a weedy lot near downtown 
Tulsa, said Herzog teamed up with his company because "they like our work." 
</P>
<P>
The relationship allowed McGrath's business to rise virtually overnight from 
small rail jobs in Oklahoma worth less than $100,000 each to public works jobs 
worth 10 to 100 times that amount. 
</P>
<P>
In March, 1987, McGrath was awarded his first subcontract on the Los Angeles 
transit system -- a $13-million construction job on the Blue Line. Herzog, the 
prime contractor on that job, received $43.9 million. The companies also worked 
together on two other Blue Line contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Now, after a six-year relationship, Herzog would like to sever its ties with 
the smaller company because of the "great suspicion" caused by union challenges 
to McGrath's claim to being Cherokee, according to Herzog attorney George 
Kieffer. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog, the attorney said, has become "uncomfortable" with the fact that 
McGrath is only 1/64 Indian. Kieffer said Herzog is attempting to subcontract 
with black- and Latino-owned firms. 
</P>
<P>
"This (controversy over McGrath's status as a Cherokee) has put a severe strain 
on our relationship," said Al Landes, Western states vice president of Herzog. 
"We almost can't afford to use Jon." The International Union of Operating 
Engineers Local 12 has repeatedly complained that McGrath acts as a "front" to 
enable Herzog to obtain contracts. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath and Herzog deny the accusation, and attribute it to the union's anger 
over the refusal of the companies to hire union workers in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Research Group, representing the union, formally challenged McGrath's 
claim to being Indian in a July 31, 1987, letter to the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Agencies such as the Transportation Commission are authorized under federal 
regulations to require a contractor whose minority status has been challenged 
to present evidence of being the victim of social and economic disadvantages. 
</P>
<P>
A federal regulation contained in county transportation commission guidelines 
states: 
</P>
<P>
"The individual's social disadvantage must be chronic, longstanding and 
substantial, not fleeting or insignificant. The individual's social 
disadvantage must have negatively affected his or her entry into and/or 
advancement in the business world." 
</P>
<P>
But county Transportation Commission officials did not require McGrath to 
present such evidence and instead accepted documentation that the contractor is 
1/64 Indian and a member of the Cherokee Nation as proof of his disadvantaged 
minority status. 
</P>
<P>
"It is being continually reasserted by the Cherokee Nation that he (McGrath) is 
a member of the Cherokee Nation . . . and we accept that," said Leslie Porter, 
deputy executive director of financial and administrative services for the 
Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about federal regulations requiring proof of chronic disadvantage when a 
minority firm is challenged, Porter said, "I'm not familiar with that." 
</P>
<P>
When the commission failed to require McGrath to prove that he was 
disadvantaged, the union forwarded its complaint to federal authorities. In 
1988, the U.S. Department of Transportation ordered state transportation 
officials in Oklahoma to hold a hearing on McGrath's status as a minority 
contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Three witnesses testified for McGrath at the hearing held Sept. 13, 1988. No 
one appeared in opposition to McGrath. John Richardson, who operated the Labor 
Research Group, said he does not recall being notified of the hearing. Norman 
Hill, general counsel for the Oklahoma state Department of Transportation, said 
Richardson probably was not notified because state officials did not know the 
identity of the complainant. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath testified at the hearing that he had considered himself a Cherokee 
since he was a child and, as proof, said he remembered raising his hand in the 
sixth grade when the teacher asked how many of the students were Indian. He 
testified that since his childhood he had attended Indian events such as 
pow-wows -- which are open to the public. He also said he joined several Indian 
business organizations as an adult and received a minority enterprise 
development award in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath's testimony did not relate any instances of discrimination or 
disadvantages except his assertion that other businessmen were occasionally 
reluctant to advance him funds or supplies when they learned his company was 
categorized as a minority firm. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if any competitors had made "discriminatory remarks," McGrath answered, 
"Yes they have. On one occasion a gentleman made a comment . . . that I was 
about as much Indian as a particular part of his anatomy." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Lee Fleming, registrar of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, testified 
that McGrath joined the tribe in 1981 and had requested an absentee ballot to 
vote in a tribal election in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Gary Miles Victor, who identified himself as Osage and Choctaw, 
testified that he had known Jon McGrath's father since 1956 and that the elder 
McGrath was proud of his Cherokee background. Victor said that he had been out 
of state when Jon McGrath was growing up, but that he had subsequently seen the 
younger man at pow-wows and that McGrath was active in the Native American 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma submitted a legal brief supporting McGrath's 
claim to being Indian, arguing that the tribe alone has the authority to decide 
who is a Cherokee. 
</P>
<P>
State hearing officers ruled on Oct. 14, 1988, that Jon McGrath qualified as a 
disadvantaged minority subcontractor. 
</P>
<P>
"Jon McGrath was known among his schoolmates as far back as grade school as 
having Native American lineage," hearing officers found. "Jon McGrath has 
publicly acknowledged his Cherokee heritage since at least the sixth grade." 
</P>
<P>
But if Jon McGrath considered himself a Cherokee since childhood, he apparently 
kept that fact from some people who were very close to him, The Times found. 
</P>
<P>
Ray and Beatrice Hardacre live on one side of the white frame house in which 
Jon McGrath grew up in Tulsa. Bill and Hertha Beattie live on the other side. 
Both elderly couples know the McGrath family well. 
</P>
<P>
"He was our boy for years, I'll tell you," Ray Hardacre said of Jon McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
"We just loved the kids," Hertha Beattie said of Jon and his brother. "We kept 
the kids when their mother was sick." 
</P>
<P>
Both couples said they were unaware of McGrath's claim of being Indian. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath said in response: "We are Indian." 
</P>
<P>
John Wyrick Jr., of Tulsa, says that he had been a close friend of Jon McGrath 
since the two were in about the ninth grade. They played baseball together, 
roomed together in college and belonged to the same fraternity. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if McGrath ever referred to himself as an Indian, Wyrick said he 
"vaguely" recalled McGrath saying something about a relative being Indian. 
</P>
<P>
"He seemed to like the idea of being classified as an Irishman," said Wyrick 
when asked if Mcgrath identified with an ethnic group. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no reaction," McGrath responded. 
</P>
<P>
The question of whether a person of Jon McGrath's background should be awarded 
public works jobs as an Indian subcontractor receives mixed responses from 
Native American organizations. 
</P>
<P>
For some, it is a question of Indian self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Cherokees say someone is Cherokee . . . that really has to be accepted 
by public and private entities," said Steven Stallings, president of the 
National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
For others, it is just one more example of whites exploiting Indians. 
</P>
<P>
"I really do resent the fact that this man or any man is playing with a little 
drop of Indian blood for his own benefit," said Evelyn Stephens, executive 
director of the federally funded Oklahoma Tribal Assistance Program in Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath completed his jobs on the Blue Line and went to work for Herzog as a 
minority subcontractor in other parts of the country, including Baltimore and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MINORITY IDENTIFICATION 
</P>
<P>
Copies of identification cards showing that Jon McGrath is 1/64 Indian and a 
member of the Cherokee Nation are on file with the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission as documentation that the Tulsa railroad builder is a 
disadvantaged minority businessman. McGrath Construction Corp. has gained more 
than $19 million worth of minority contracts on the rapid transit system under 
construction in Los Angeles -- more than any other so-called disadvantaged firm 
has received. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath's status as a minority group member was challenged by a union in 1987, 
but the transportation commission never required McGrath to show that he was 
the victim of "chronic . . social disadvantaged" as called for by federal 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The commission instead accepted McGrath's membership in the Cherokee Nation as 
proof that he is a minority group member and eligible for contracts meant for 
disadvantaged firms.

RETAILERS' BLEAK CHRISTMAS MAY BE THE WORST SINCE '82 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE and STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Retailers in Southern California and around the nation looked in their 
stockings this Christmas season and found a lump of coal. 
</P>
<P>
As shoppers visited the malls on Wednesday to exchange holiday gifts and to 
check the after-Christmas sales, industry analysts and officials were 
estimating that sales for the holiday shopping season will fall below most 
expectations, making this possibly the worst season since the recession of 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks as though people don't have money to spend," said Joyce Free, who was 
shopping at Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of anyone who is happy," said E. Harlin Smith, a spokesman for 
Los Angeles-based Carter Hawley Hale Stores, which owns Broadway-Southern 
California and three other Western department store chains. 
</P>
<P>
Because retailers generally earn half their profits during the Christmas 
shopping season, analysts said this year's poor sales could spell trouble next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what makes it particularly worrisome is that, unlike 1982, this is now 
a heavily leveraged industry, and a lot of the major players require a large 
amount of cash flow to service their debts," said Ira Kalish, an economist with 
the retail consulting firm Management Horizons in Columbus, Ohio. "The 
seriousness of this downturn will only accelerate the process of shakeout and 
consolidation in the retail industry." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts and industry executives blamed the poor sales on the recession, the 
weak dollar, high interest rates, fears of unemployment and worries about the 
Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Unseasonal weather also may have hurt. Extreme cold, snow and flooding in the 
West kept shoppers away, while surprisingly mild weather in the East hurt 
apparel sales. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at malls across Southern California there were signs that shoppers 
were still being cautious the day after Christmas, traditionally one of the 
busiest shopping days of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Free said that last year she headed to Topanga Plaza first thing in the 
morning, but was stuck there until noon because of the crowds. This year, "I 
was out of there by 9:30," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the parking lot outside, valet parking service manager Alfredo Mena of 
Glendale said he had parked only 20 cars by 10:15 a.m., more than two hours 
after the mall had opened. "Last year it was madness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there were some hot spots. The California Highway Patrol issued a 
major traffic alert when shoppers jammed freeways to South Coast Plaza in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
And in Brea, shoppers mobbed a Knott's Berry Farm gift store in the Brea Mall 
when employees accidentally put out a sign advertising 70% markdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The sign should have read 50% off, but by the time employees discovered their 
mistake, a sales line had snaked out into the mall corridor with many shoppers 
holding caseloads of jams, jellies, syrups and other popular Knott's items. 
</P>
<P>
"I came and saw the crowd and I jumped in there," said Steve Dallape of 
Fullerton. "I've got gifts for the next three years. Before Christmas, it would 
have cost me a paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
For the season just ended, final sales results will not be in for weeks, but 
most analysts said not even a surge of buying the last weekend before Christmas 
could salvage the season, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Many merchants reported that their sales at stores open more than one year -- 
known in the retailing industry as same-store or comparable-store sales -- were 
flat or down from a year ago. Taking into account inflation, which is running 
at more than 6% this year, the figures would look even worse. 
</P>
<P>
Total sales were either flat or fell an average 3% from a year ago in 
inflation-adjusted dollars, analysts estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Some early results: 
</P>
<P>
* Smith declined to say how Carter Hawley's sales in December compared with a 
year ago, but he said results appear to be better than they were in November, 
when same-store sales declined 7.4% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
* At Chicago-based Sears, by some standards the nation's biggest retailer, 
officials said sales were lower than expected, despite improvement in late 
December. 
</P>
<P>
* K mart reported that both total sales and per-store sales would be up 
slightly over a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
* J.C. Penney Co. said its comparable-store sales were down "slightly." 
</P>
<P>
* Dayton Hudson reported mixed, but generally weak results, particularly among 
its more upscale department stores in the upper Midwest where sales fell 2% to 
3%. Dayton Hudson's Target discount division was the top performer, with sales 
gains estimated at 1% to 2% from a year ago. Mervyn's, its moderate-price 
department store chain based in Hayward, Calif., reported sales that were 
roughly even with last year's. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, customers were choosier, bought less, avoided luxury and big-ticket 
items and went for necessities, merchants said. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of buying $400 to $500 attache cases, they were buying more of the 
$200 ones," said Angie Kindle, assistant manager of John's Fifth Avenue Luggage 
in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
As a further sign of the trend, one of the season's few big gainers was Pic 'N' 
Save, the Dominguez-based close-out chain, which said its sales rose in the 
"high single-digit" range. 
</P>
<P>
"When people get worried about the economy, they look to stretch their dollars 
more," said Steven J. Miral, senior vice president of Pic 'N' Save. 
</P>
<P>
At ANA Discount Photo and Appliance in San Diego, manager David Vandegrift said 
sales of major appliances such as washers, dryers and refrigerators went poorly 
this Christmas season, and Wednesday morning sales got off to a slow start 
despite reduced prices. 
</P>
<P>
J. C. Penney said its sales defied the pattern somewhat. Spokesman Duncan Muir 
said some of the company's higher-priced items sold very well in categories 
such as dresses and sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
But sales of cosmetics and fragrances -- which consumers usually buy in lieu of 
more expensive gifts -- also did well at J.C. Penney stores, and the company's 
weak sellers were pricey items such as luggage, furniture and home furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the poor sales could mean trouble for some retailers. "There'll be 
some bankruptcies, particularly of smaller companies that have gotten in 
difficulty and couldn't handle a 10% or 12% drop in sales," said Kurt Barnard, 
publisher of the newsletter Retail Marketing Report. 
</P>
<P>
But others said things might not be so bad. "Fortunately for the retailers, 
they were not anticipating a good season, so they canceled as much merchandise 
as they could prior to the season; they also took pre-Christmas markdowns and 
shrank inventories as much as possible" and hired less part-time help, said 
Monroe Greenstein, an industry analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, "Earnings will not be as bad as you might expect looking at the 
sales," he said.

County contributed to this report.

GORBACHEV STILL LACKS PRECISE REFORM PLANS 
</P>

<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev amassed more legal power this week than any 
previous Soviet leader, but such is the depth of his country's crisis that not 
even he can be confident that this will be enough to pull it from its growing 
political and economic chaos. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is less one of power than of plain politics: Gorbachev has yet to 
lay down a precise plan to reform the economy along market lines, to work out a 
compact that will preserve the Soviet Union as a federal state and to build a 
system of government that supports these changes. 
</P>
<P>
He has ideas on all, to be sure, but the "paralysis of power" that has gripped 
the country for more than a year and worsened its multiple crises lies, first 
of all, in his own irresoluteness and consequent inability to win support for 
the tough decisions required for the country's transformation. 
</P>
<P>
The gravity of these crises is unmistakable, and Soviet politicians seriously 
discuss the possibility of civil war if solutions are not found quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union is beset, above all, by the accelerating collapse of its 
economy: The system of state ownership, central planning and government 
management no longer functions as an organic whole, and growing barter trade 
and an annual inflation rate of perhaps 80% are the only real signs of the 
market economy that Gorbachev has promoted to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
Rising nationalism, spurred by the country's economic problems, now threatens 
the breakup of the Soviet Union as a federal state. The secession of the Baltic 
republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania appears inevitable, and perhaps that 
of Georgia and Moldova as well. Gorbachev wants a union treaty to establish a 
new relationship between the central government and the republics, but passions 
are so high that little progress has been made. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union's new democratic institutions, still young and uncertain, have 
so far proven incapable of resolving either the economic or the ethnic crisis, 
and that failure has compounded both, led to extensive social unrest and 
created a crisis of confidence in perestroika, Gorbachev's reform program. 
Trust in Gorbachev himself, as measured by Soviet public opinion polls, 
declines almost weekly, and Soviet commentators speculate on the 
"post-Gorbachev era." 
</P>
<P>
That Gorbachev would win approval for constitutional changes, however, was 
never in doubt, although they required a two-thirds majority in the Congress of 
People's Deputies, the national Parliament. What remains uncertain as the 
Congress draws to a close is whether he won enough support for the political 
consensus he needs. 
</P>
<P>
"Mikhail Gorbachev is trying to rescue his leadership from collapse," a member 
of the president's inner circle commented. "The stakes are very, very high. We 
are talking about the fate of Gorbachev, the fate of perestroika, the fate of 
the nation. He must act, and boldly, but in a law-based democracy, to act he 
needs power." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, even as they voted to amend the Soviet constitution and broaden the 
president's authority, members of the Congress of People's Deputies asked this 
week how Gorbachev would use these new powers, whether they were giving him the 
authority he needed to resolve these fundamental problems -- or whether they 
were creating a dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
"Power is a means, not an end," Pavel G. Bunich, a pro-market economist and 
deputy, commented. "Gorbachev will get his new powers, but will we get any 
progress? Doubtful, very doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
"In the economy, for example, the problem is not getting enough power to push a 
program through, but working out that program and getting support for it from 
the people. With sufficient support, more power would be unnecessary, for the 
market would pull us forward with even greater effectiveness." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev argued, however, that "life itself" had shown the need for greater 
presidential authority. Not even government officials were obeying his orders, 
nor were they bound to do so under the constitution. The advent of democracy, 
moreover, had convinced every region that it was sovereign. Every factory 
manager, every farmer, the members of every local council felt that they knew 
better than Moscow what needed to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"When laying emphasis on dismantling the command system and breaking the chains 
that fettered us, we did not make all the essential provisions for making 
decisions and executing them," Gorbachev told journalists last week at the 
Congress. "Democracy is already accompanied by such outbursts and sheer 
exhaustion that we are on the brink of chaos." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, addressing the Congress, promised action and an end to vacillation. 
"We shall act now, saving every day and drastically changing the system and the 
nature of our way of doing things," he said. "This means we should have new 
structures and new people to carry this weight and grapple in earnest with the 
problems the nation faces." 
</P>
<P>
But this declaration brought a quick retort from his critics. "We always say 
that the president lacks powers," commented Vladimir K. Chernyak, a leading 
economist from the Ukraine. "But maybe he lacks something else -- firm 
positions, a consistent line and effective policies." 
</P>
<P>
Four times this year, Gorbachev has sought additional powers, either from the 
Congress of People's Deputies or from the Supreme Soviet, the country's 
legislature, and each time promised firm action to deal with the deepening 
political and economic crises. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the "paralysis of power," now a political byword here, has only become more 
evident. Promised decrees on economic reform, for example, were delayed for 
months -- or never issued. Reorganization of the government, streamlining it 
into a dozen key ministries, has been postponed repeatedly. Conflicts between 
presidential decrees, ministerial orders, government regulations and 
legislation -- all new -- remain unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a man who does not know what to do," a former Gorbachev adviser 
commented, asking not to be named. "In some cases, it is because he does not 
understand the issues or appreciate their urgency. In some cases, he is pulled 
every which way by his advisers, the ministers, the generals and dozens of 
others. And often, quite often, he simply cannot decide for fear of making a 
grievous error. He never forgets how close we are to real chaos." 
</P>
<P>
Even within the Communist Party leadership, Gorbachev has come under attack for 
his failure to act. "Of all the shortages we have today, the main shortage is 
that of specific action -- at all levels," Ivan K. Polozkov, the conservative 
first secretary of the Russian Communist Party, declared earlier this month. 
"Even when we are convinced of the correctness of what has to be done, when the 
aims and the tasks have been determined, the work stands still and nothing is 
done." 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev's approach to the crisis -- enhancing his authority to rule by 
decree, to declare states of emergency and to take over administration of any 
republic or region -- is worrisome to many, even to some of his closest 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the foreign minister, resigned in an impassioned 
warning to Gorbachev and the nation to beware of "reactionary forces" that were 
already pressing the leadership hard and perhaps positioning themselves to 
establish a dictatorship, using the president's additional powers. 
</P>
<P>
The shift rightward is clear. Liberals are being forced from the government and 
party leadership. Gorbachev's policy declarations lay greater stress on the 
"socialist choice" and reflect little of the bold reforms approved at the 
Communist Party congress six months ago. The military, security forces and 
police have regained much of their past prominence. Declared conservatives 
among deputies at the Congress outnumbered liberals by a margin of more than 2 
to 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Greater presidential powers, largely without the checks and balances that are 
placed on an American president or the parliamentary restraints that a British 
prime minister has, is very risky when the right is in resurgence," commented 
Nikolai I. Travkin, a leader of the Democratic Party of Russia. "The 
combination has great potential for explosion. Does Gorbachev realize what he 
is creating?" 
</P>
<P>
The first calls for a "strong hand" to run the government came, however, not 
from the far right, but from radical reformers who, in mid-1989, urged 
Gorbachev to use extraordinary powers to push through a bolder program for the 
country's political and economic transformation over the resistance of old-line 
bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Sergei B. Stankevich, the first deputy mayor in Moscow's radical-led 
municipal government, supports what he calls "authoritarian rule" to halt the 
spreading chaos and speed the resolution of the present crises. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a president ready and able to act," Stankevich said. "And Gorbachev 
will never be ready until he (has the power and) is able. The paralysis of 
power is nationwide, and it has halted any meaningful reform. The place to 
begin a recovery action is in the president's office." 
</P>
<P>
Roy A. Medvedev, a leading Marxist historian, onetime dissident and now both a 
deputy and a member of the Communist Party's Central Committee, also argued 
that fears of a dictatorship are misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
"These changes are important, for they give the presidency a vertical structure 
that it lacked," Medvedev said. "The president could issue an ukaz (decree) in 
the Kremlin and not be certain that it would even be published, let alone 
obeyed. In the past, the party enforced decisions through its discipline, but 
in some places the party is now not even in the government. 
</P>
<P>
"By law, it is true, Gorbachev now has more power than any Soviet leader ever 
had, but it is less power than he inherited when he became the party's general 
secretary. When the party gave up its monopoly on power -- at Gorbachev's 
insistence, remember -- he gave up enormous power. What he is doing is getting 
back what he needs to operate and fulfill the people's expectations. This man 
is a democrat, not a dictator."

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With three weeks to go before a get-out-or-else deadline on Kuwait, the United 
States and Iraq have resumed contacts here after a suspension of more than a 
week, Western diplomats said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The contacts, broken off after a dispute over dates for reciprocal 
Washington-Baghdad visits, have resumed quietly, said the diplomats, who were 
not specific as to the content of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
There were no official announcements of the talks' resumption from either 
government, but both sides have expressed eagerness to get proposed peace 
negotiations back on track. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not given up hope on the diplomatic process," said Joseph C. Wilson IV, 
who is in charge of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the renewal of Washington-Baghdad contacts, however, other signals in 
the Persian Gulf were more grim: 
</P>
<P>
* U.S. military commanders in Saudi Arabia said Iraq appears to be ignoring the 
United Nations' ultimatum to withdraw from Kuwait and seems to be bracing for 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
* Iraq test-fired a surface-to-surface missile, aiming it away from the 
multinational forces massed in the gulf. A similar test-firing in early 
December caught allied forces off guard and triggered a heightened alert for 
some U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
* Amid heightened concern about possible terrorist attacks tied to the Persian 
Gulf crisis, the State Department ordered the evacuation of non-essential U.S. 
personnel and dependents from Jordan and Sudan. Evacuations have already begun 
in six other Mideast and North African nations. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department, meanwhile, denied a report in an Israeli newspaper that 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III would travel to Baghdad on Jan. 9 to meet 
with President Saddam Hussein. Despite the renewal of contacts, "there is no 
indication from the Iraqis that they have changed their position on dates," 
said State Department spokeswoman Sondra McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has insisted that Baker visit Baghdad on Jan. 12, a date the Bush 
Administration has rejected as being too close to the United Nation's Jan. 15 
deadline for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. The United States has countered by 
offering several dates up until Jan. 3 for a Baker visit, although President 
Bush has stopped short of flatly ruling out a visit after that date. 
</P>
<P>
State Department officials also downplayed the resumption of contacts, which 
came Wednesday morning with a telephone call between Wilson and Iraq's deputy 
foreign minister, Nizar Hamdoon, according to Washington sources. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just had a holiday and a weekend," said one U.S. official. "We are 
available any time, anywhere to speak with the Iraqis," he added, noting that 
U.S. officials spoke with Iraq's ambassador to Washington, Mohammed Mashat, on 
Friday before Mashat departed for consultations in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
On Christmas Day, Iraqi newspapers issued an appeal for peace talks with the 
United States saying that, despite the approaching deadline, it was not too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
With Washington and Baghdad unable to agree on dates for reciprocal talks on 
the gulf crisis, the two sides deadlocked earlier this month. A planned Dec. 17 
visit by Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz to Washington was canceled when the 
Bush Administration refused Iraq's Jan. 12 date for the Baker visit. 
</P>
<P>
With the renewal of U.S.-Iraqi contacts, diplomats here speculated on an array 
of formulas to break the deadlock. One is to jettison the idea of dual meetings 
and hold only one: in Baghdad between Baker and Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
This formula would dispense with the tangle over who sets the second date. Iraq 
insisted that if Washington has the right to schedule a meeting between Aziz 
and President Bush, Baghdad can set the date for a Baker-Hussein meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Agreement on a single meeting would mean that negotiations on a date could 
begin anew, with both sides contributing to a compromise. Implicit in this 
notion is that Hussein would yield on his Jan. 12 date and Bush would give up 
his demand that talks in Baghdad take place no later than Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
"They could cut the difference down the middle," suggested one Western 
diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq is said to value a visit to Washington, to give Aziz not only a 
chance to meet Bush but also to see congressional leaders -- and to appear on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq wants to make a publicity splash," said a European diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here think both sides are eager for talks: the Bush Administration to 
satisfy doubts that it has exhausted all peaceful means of freeing Kuwait; 
Hussein to avert impending war by getting a diplomatic process under way. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq took pains Wednesday to dampen speculation that a recall of 26 of its 
ambassadors from abroad signaled a change in policy toward Kuwait, which, after 
its Aug. 2 invasion, Baghdad annexed as its 19th province. Some diplomats had 
suggested that the unusual recall foreshadowed a major announcement by Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
In a broadcast statement, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said the ambassadors were 
recalled for consultations during the Christmas season because many had not 
returned to Baghdad during the 4 1/2-month Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq is reported to be shuffling its diplomatic corps and closing some 
embassies and consulates as a money-saving measure. 
</P>
<P>
Some diplomats profess to see signs of erosion in the Baghdad government's 
stand on keeping Kuwait. One diplomat noted that the ruling Revolutionary 
Command Council, in a recent document, said it is Iraq's "belief" that Kuwait 
is part of the country, a slight backing off from the usual all-out insistence 
that the oil-rich mini-state is irrevocably annexed territory. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad is also troubled by its obvious strategic weaknesses, diplomats say. 
Iraqi officials were alarmed by a recent request by Turkey for a new supply of 
allied aircraft from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, creating the 
prospect of attack from Iraq's northern border should hostilities erupt. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Iraq published a warning to Turkey over an alleged Dec. 12 
overflight of Iraqi territory by a pair of Turkish jets. Privately, Iraq has 
sent a message to Ankara asking for bilateral talks, Western diplomats here 
said.

STATE HIGH SCHOOLS EXPECTED TO GROW 34% IN NEXT DECADE;

<P>
The number of California high school students will surge by 34% over the next 
decade, reversing the no-growth trend of the 1980s, the U.S. Department of 
Education said in a report to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the nation, children of the baby boomers swelled class rolls in 
elementary schools during the 1980s. They will do the same for high schools 
during the next decade, the government report said. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, the number of students enrolled in public high schools is expected 
to grow from 11.2 million this year to an estimated 13.4 million in the year 
2000, a gain of about 20%, the report estimates. 
</P>
<P>
The projected growth rate is far higher in California, where an influx of 
immigrants and higher birth rates have fueled an enrollment boom in the 
elementary grades. That surge is about to sweep through secondary schools. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment in the state's public high schools is expected to rise from 1.32 
million this year to 1.77 million in the year 2000, a 34% increase. Meanwhile, 
the number of graduates will grow from an estimated 230,580 next June to 
333,640 in the class of the year 2000, an increase of about 45%. 
</P>
<P>
The figures are good news for employers of young people and for college 
admissions officers, but they will cause problems for officials who oversee 
school construction. 
</P>
<P>
"All those elementary kids we got in the last decade are growing up on us. And 
we don't have room for all of them," said Henry Heydt, assistant director of 
the school facilities division in the state Education Department in Sacramento. 
"We need to build 166 high schools in the next five years." 
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, school planners were able to shift some students from 
overcrowded elementary buildings to empty high school classrooms. But that will 
no longer be an option, Heydt said. 
</P>
<P>
The state projects that its schools will gain an extra 230,000 students each 
year for the next five years. "Essentially, we need to build 19 new classrooms 
every day," Heydt said. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Finance predicted in September that huge enrollment 
increases in public schools will continue at least until the end of the decade. 
Figures released by the department's population unit showed that enrollment in 
kindergarten through 12th grade will grow from almost 5 million to 6.8 million 
in the fall of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment jumps have been the underlying causes of problems such as 
overcrowded classes, the shaky financial condition faced by 20 to 30 school 
districts and a $5-billion backlog in unmet school construction needs. 
</P>
<P>
State officials predicted that the highest projected percentage increase would 
be in Riverside County, where school enrollments are expected to increase by 
almost 107% -- from 201,600 this year to 417,000 in 1999. Los Angeles County is 
expecting a 36% increase in the next 10 years, Orange County 44%, San Diego 
County 55% and Ventura County 30%. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government report, "Projections of Education Statistics to 2001," is 
based on data compiled over the last decade or longer to project trends over 
the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
It indicates that for the most part, the enrollment trends of the 1980s will be 
reversed in the decade ahead: 
</P>
<P>
* Nationwide, public school enrollments in kindergarten through eighth grade 
rose from 27.6 million in 1980 to 29.5 million in 1990. The number is expected 
to peak at 31.1 million in 1996 and finish the decade by edging down to 30.7 
million by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
* Public high school enrollments nationwide declined from 13.2 million in 1980 
to 11.2 million in 1990. They are expected to increase steadily to 13.4 million 
by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
* In California, enrollments through the eighth grade rose even faster over the 
last 10 years, from 2.7 million in 1980 to 3.6 million this year. The number 
should peak at 3.95 million in 1998 and decline slightly to 3.92 million in the 
year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
* While elementary schools bulged, enrollment in California's high schools 
declined slightly in the 1980s. The number of students in grades nine to 12 
fell from 1.36 million in 1980 to 1.32 million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
* Nationwide, the number of high school graduates fell from 2.41 million in the 
1985 school year to an estimated 2.23 million for the current school year. But 
the graduation total is expected to increase to 2.62 million in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SURGE IN U.S. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Department of Education report estimates that the number of students 
graduating from California high schools will rise 45% over the next decade, 
from 230,580 in 1991 to 333,640 in the year 2000.

WILSON NAMES EX-SIERRA CLUB HEAD TO RUN RESOURCES AGENCY; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: DOUGLAS WHEELER PROMISES TO STRESS COMPROMISE BETWEEN 
CONSERVATIONISTS AND BUSINESSES. ACTIVISTS GENERALLY ARE PLEASED WITH HIS 
SELECTION.

<P>
Gov.-elect Pete Wilson on Wednesday named as his secretary of resources a 
former Sierra Club director who pledged to aggressively mediate disputes 
between the environmental movement and the business community. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas P. Wheeler, currently executive vice president of the World Wildlife 
Fund and Conservation Foundation, said he intends to be a "responsible 
activist" who will strive to include all points of view in the Administration's 
decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been my experience that you make more progress, achieve more 
conservation, through cooperation than through confrontation," Wheeler said at 
a news conference with Wilson. "We need to adopt pragmatic and inclusive 
approaches if we're going to solve these polarized issues." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who during last fall's election opposed Propositions 128 and 130, known 
as "Big Green" and "Forests Forever" by their supporters, said he believes 
voters in rejecting both measures demonstrated that they do not want "radical 
environmental change" but seek instead to protect the state's natural resources 
without grinding the economy to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the centrist philosophy of Wheeler, a Republican, will "assure 
that both board chairmen and backpackers believe California is a state worth 
living and working in." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson declined to say how the Resources Agency would be affected by his 
proposed creation of a California Environmental Protection Agency, which would 
require reorganization of at least two Cabinet-level agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The resources secretary currently oversees the Coastal Commission and the 
departments of Fish and Game, Water Resources and Forestry, among others. The 
environmental affairs secretary, whom Wilson has yet to name, supervises three 
semi-independent commissions that regulate air and water quality and waste 
management. 
</P>
<P>
A 48-year-old native of Brooklyn, N.Y., Wheeler from 1972 to 1977 was a deputy 
assistant secretary of the Interior under Presidents Richard M. Nixon and 
Gerald R. Ford. In 1980 he founded the American Farmland Trust, a nationwide 
nonprofit group dedicated to preserving agricultural land in the face of rapid 
suburban development. 
</P>
<P>
He was executive director of the Sierra Club from 1985 until 1987, when he left 
to become an executive at the Washington-based Conservation Foundation, the 
same environmental organization that produced William K. Reilly, administrator 
of the federal Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Wheeler left the Sierra Club amid friction with the group's volunteer activists 
and board members, many of whom disliked his management style. Wheeler was said 
to be too much an advocate of centralized control in an organization that 
historically was run from the bottom up with a great deal of involvement by 
grass-roots volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Sierra Club leaders and other environmentalists applauded his 
appointment Wednesday, even while expressing some unease about Wheeler's 
willingness to compromise with the business community. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hattoy, Southern California director for the Sierra Club, said Wheeler can 
pursue a "winning combination" of working with Republicans and grass-roots 
environmentalists at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"Doug makes environmentalists a little nervous because he's such a corporate 
kind of guy, and he makes Republicans a little nervous because he's such an 
environmentalist," Hattoy said. "It makes a good bridge." 
</P>
<P>
Considering that most environmental organizations endorsed Wilson's opponent, 
Democrat Dianne Feinstein, leaders in the movement said they could find little 
to quibble with in the governor-elect's selection. 
</P>
<P>
"John Muir isn't governor of California; Pete Wilson is," said Denis Hayes, who 
was coordinator of the first Earth Day in 1970 and now directs Green Seal Inc., 
a nonprofit program that certifies commercial products as environmentally 
sound. "I think his interests are Wilson's interests." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his career, Wheeler has demonstrated a knack for working with -- and 
sometimes criticizing -- all sides on tough issues, while taking the middle 
road himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not going to be outspoken; he won't be an aggressive leader taking 
unorthodox stands," said Patricia Schifferle, a former Wilderness Society 
California representative and now a private environmental consultant. "But I 
think his past record demonstrates he has been willing to stand up for 
environmental protection." 
</P>
<P>
During the 1988 election campaign, Wheeler wrote an article for the Washington 
Post in which he rapped former President Ronald Reagan for appointing 
"insensitive" and "incompetent" environmental administrators. But in the same 
piece, Wheeler criticized the Sierra Club for being too rigidly partisan in its 
support for Democratic candidates, noting that the club objected when Wilson, 
then running for reelection to the Senate, used positive letters from the 
organization in his campaign commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson praised his nominee for understanding what needs to be done to 
"harmonize" environmental quality and economic development. He said recent 
history in the Legislature proves that partisan confrontation only produces 
stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
"The hard lesson many interest groups have learned is that it is perhaps better 
to see if there isn't some rational and perfectly legitimate way to accommodate 
one another (rather) than continue this rather unproductive warfare that leads 
to no progress for either side," Wilson said.

2 RANGERS ARE RIDING HIGH IN THEIR CAREERS; 
</P>

PALM SPRINGS: TO GET TO WORK ATOP MT. SAN JACINTO, THEY TAKE THE AERIAL TRAMWAY 
TO AN ELEVATION OF 8,400 FEET.

MT. SAN JACINTO STATE WILDERNESS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They're the only park rangers who ride a tram to work. 
</P>
<P>
It's either take the Palms Springs Aerial Tramway or hike eight miles to their 
ranger station. 
</P>
<P>
There are no roads and no vehicles are allowed in the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Frates and Eric Hanson are stationed at Long Valley Ranger Station, 
elevation 8,400 feet, on the eastern slopes of Mt. San Jacinto above Palm 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
It's the highest ranger station in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been a ranger 12 years in several different state parks. This is the 
kind of assignment rangers dream about," said Frates, 41, chief ranger in the 
10,000-acre Mt. San Jacinto State Wilderness since last December. 
</P>
<P>
"We're out of doors in the pristine mountainous backcountry every day. It's the 
remoteness, the fact that only hikers, backpackers and cross-country skiers 
come here. The wilderness is alive with wildlife, deer, coyote, cougars, 
raccoons, ring-tail cats, a lot of birds. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Frates and Hanson are the only rangers permanently assigned to Mt. San Jacinto 
State Wilderness, one of seven state wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
They patrol 29 miles of trails here, each hiking 5 1/2 to 20 miles a day. They 
maintain the four wilderness campgrounds, Round the Valley, 2 1/2 miles from 
the ranger station; Tamarack Valley, 3 miles; Little Round Valley, 7 1/2 miles, 
and Strawberry Junction, 6 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Round Valley at 9,100 feet and Little Round Valley at 9,700 feet are the two 
highest overnight camping areas in the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson and Frates regularly hike the trail to the top of the 10,804-foot San 
Jacinto Peak, the second-highest mountain in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"People get lost, some suffer heart attacks, some slip and fall on the ice, 
rocks and cliffs," said Hanson, 32, stationed in the wilderness off and on for 
the last 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
On their patrols, the two rangers maintain the backcountry camps. They answer 
visitors' questions and give directions. They give medical aid to injured 
hikers and carry them out on litters if necessary. They also lead searches for 
overdue hikers. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year there are a few fatalities up here, from falls or heart attacks," 
Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
There is generally year-round snow in the high country, sometimes six to eight 
feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
It may be hot at the bottom of the mountain when Frates and Hanson arrive at 
the tram for the 2 1/2-mile, 14-minute ride to the top, but they always wear 
warm clothing. 
</P>
<P>
"The temperature is often 40 degrees colder on the mountain. Below-zero 
temperatures are common in winter. I've seen it -63 degrees with the wind-chill 
factor," Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
Long Valley Ranger Station is only a quarter of a mile from the Mountaintop 
Tram Station. Anyone going beyond the ranger station is required to obtain a 
wilderness permit. 
</P>
<P>
Park aides and volunteers are on duty at the ranger station when Frates and 
Hanson are out on patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The two men frequently stay overnight at the ranger station when storms and 
high winds shut down the tram or they are involved in search-and-rescue 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Tram passengers frequently ask the two men in ranger outfits what they're doing 
in the cable car heading up or down the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
"Heading for (or from) our heavenly roost," Frates or Hanson replies.

RUSHDIE'S DEATH SENTENCE STANDS, IRAN SAYS

<P>
Iran's spiritual leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ruled Wednesday that the 
death sentence issued last year against British author Salman Rushdie remains 
in force, Tehran Radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
Khamenei issued a statement two days after Rushdie renounced his novel "The 
Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
The statement described Rushdie as an apostate -- an apparent rejection of the 
author's announcement that he had embraced Islam. 
</P>
<P>
The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the controversial death edict 
against Rushdie in February, 1989, for writing the novel, which many Muslims 
believe is blasphemous. 
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that Khomeini ruled before his death last year that the edict 
against Rushdie would remain in place even if the author repented and that 
Khomeini's order therefore still stands. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said Rushdie's renunciation of his novel was the first fruit of 
Khomeini's order against the author. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Tehran newspaper Abrar, owned by hard-line Iranian clerics, 
said: "Imam Khomeini's historical edict against Rushdie is irrevocable even if 
he repents." 
</P>
<P>
The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Abrar as saying the author's 
latest moves were "propaganda maneuvers by the British government aimed at 
bringing Rushdie out of isolation and making Muslims neglect the verdict." 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie made his announcement Monday after meeting with British Muslim leaders. 
He said he will not permit the publication of paperback editions or further 
translations of the book. 
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcasting Corp. quoted Rushdie as saying, "There is no God but 
Allah, and Mohammed was his last prophet." 
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old author, born in India of Muslim parents, has been in hiding 
since the death edict was handed down.

3 LEADERS OF JEWISH UNDERGROUND FREED; 
</P>
<P>
ISRAEL: THEY SERVE LESS THAN 7 YEARS OF LIFE TERMS FOR ANTI-PALESTINIAN 
TERRORISM. LIBERALS CONDEMN THE EARLY RELEASES.

<P>
Three leaders of the anti-Palestinian Jewish Underground movement were paroled 
Wednesday after serving less than seven years of their life sentences for 
terrorist attacks. 
</P>
<P>
The three -- Menachem Livni, Shaul Nir and Uzi Sharbav -- were the last of 27 
members of the so-called Jewish Underground to be freed from prison. The group 
carried out car bombings and other attacks in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in 
the early 1980s that killed three Palestinian students and maimed two West Bank 
Arab mayors. 
</P>
<P>
Livni, often described as the leader of the group, was convicted in 1985 of 
masterminding the car bombings that maimed Nablus Mayor Bassam Shaka and 
Ramallah Mayor Karim Halaf. Nir and Sharbav were convicted the same year of a 
grenade and gun attack on the Islamic College in the West Bank city of Hebron 
in which three Arab students were killed and 30 wounded. They were arrested in 
early 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Their life sentences were reduced in stages by Israeli President Chaim Herzog 
to 10 years. Two weeks ago, a parole committee further reduced the sentences, 
making the three eligible for parole on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hard-line supporters of the Jewish Underground, who favor harsh measures 
against the Palestinian uprising, applauded the releases, and some demonstrated 
outside the prison as the men met their families and returned to a Jewish 
settlement near Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
But Israeli liberals strongly condemned the early release of the men, whose 
movement was designed to intimidate Palestinians in the occupied territories. 
Avner Rubenstein, a left-wing member of the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, 
called the early release of the three "a black day for the rule of law in 
Israel." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip on Wednesday, a Palestinian man 
in his 20s, seemingly without provocation, stabbed and wounded three Israeli 
soldiers on duty in Gaza City's main Nasser Street. Police said an army officer 
standing nearby opened fire and killed the assailant. 
</P>
<P>
No reason was adduced for the attack, and two of the soldiers remained in 
serious condition late Wednesday with chest wounds, police said. 
</P>
<P>
In another development, a militant Jewish group called the Temple Mount 
Faithful announced late Wednesday that it will attempt to occupy the site of 
Solomon's Temple, now a Muslim shrine, in the Old City this morning. 
</P>
<P>
But police immediately said that the demonstrators will not be allowed inside 
the Temple Mount, which Arabs call Haram al Sharif, or "Noble Sanctuary." Its 
grounds were the scene of bloody violence in October, when Palestinian 
protesters demonstrated after hearing that the Temple Mount Faithful were 
planning to occupy the site. 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish militants -- who want the area cleared to make way for a new Jewish 
temple -- were dissuaded by police from demonstrating that day. But a 
Palestinian protest that ensued ended with 20 Arabs killed by police gunfire.

TERRORISM CONCERNS PROMPT U.S. TO ORDER JORDAN, SUDAN EVACUATION; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST: NON-ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL AND DEPENDENTS ARE TOLD TO LEAVE. TRAVELERS 
URGED TO DEPART 'BEFORE JAN. 15.'

<P>
The State Department on Wednesday ordered the evacuation of non-essential U.S. 
personnel and dependents from Jordan and Sudan and urged other Americans to 
leave those nations amid heightened concern about possible terrorist attacks 
tied to the Persian Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The government encouraged Americans traveling in the two countries to depart 
"as soon as possible and well before Jan. 15," the deadline imposed by the U.N. 
Security Council for Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The action brings to eight the number of Middle East and North African nations 
from which Americans are being withdrawn. The Bush Administration is trying to 
reduce the number of U.S. citizens who could become hostages, terrorist targets 
or victims of mob violence in the event of war with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the Administration began 
withdrawing U.S. civilian personnel from Yemen, whose government has supported 
Iraq. On Dec. 15, the State Department added the North African nation of 
Mauritania, another Iraqi ally, to the list. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government has authorized dependents of U.S. personnel in four 
Persian Gulf nations -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab 
Emirates -- to leave if they wish. All four nations could become targets of 
Iraqi attacks in the event of war. 
</P>
<P>
Underlining the Administration's concern about terrorism, a representative of 
the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon threatened suicide attacks 
against U.S. targets worldwide if there is a military offensive against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"American interests in the world will be targeted and suicidal attacks will be 
launched in and outside the gulf and Palestine," Zeid Wehbeh, a PLO 
representative in Lebanon, said in an interview broadcast by a Lebanese radio 
station. 
</P>
<P>
It could not be determined immediately which faction of the PLO, if any, Wehbeh 
represents, U.S. officials said, but threats against U.S. citizens and 
interests in the Middle East have been a staple of statements from Iraq and its 
allies since the Persian Gulf crisis began. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Administration officials, although relieved by the release of Americans 
held hostage in Iraq itself, remain worried about the threat posed to hundreds 
of civilian government employees and thousands of non-governmental travelers, 
both tourists and business people, in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Americans could become targets of specific terrorist attacks or could be 
injured by mobs as war tensions rise, officials have warned, noting that Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein remains popular in many Arab nations. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein's popularity has been particularly high in Jordan. Wednesday's advisory 
warned that "American citizens should defer all travel" to that country, and 
that those already there "who do not have essential reason for staying should 
plan to depart the country as soon as possible and well before Jan. 15." 
</P>
<P>
The State Department used similar language about Sudan, a predominantly Arab 
country that has generally supported Iraq and where continued civil war has 
posed additional dangers to foreign travelers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as the U.S. military deployment in the gulf continues to grow, the 
Navy said that the aircraft carriers America and Theodore Roosevelt will leave 
Norfolk, Va., en route to the Middle East on Friday. The two carriers and their 
accompanying escort ships will add to a U.S. armada that already includes four 
carrier battle groups. 
</P>
<P>
And in Washington, a senior congressional Democrat accused the Administration 
of not being "tough enough or strong enough in asking the allies to do their 
part" in paying for the deployment. 
</P>
<P>
The allies have become used to saying " 'Let America do it,' and not worry 
about cooperating or helping," said House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt 
(D-Mo.). "I think those days have ended, and we've got to get the allies to 
simply come into the modern age," Gephardt said during an interview on NBC's 
"Today" television show. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration estimates that the United States has spent roughly $6.5 
billion on the gulf deployment and that eventual costs could be more than four 
times that amount. According to the Pentagon, Saudi Arabia has reimbursed the 
United States about $1 billion, most of it in cash. Other U.S. allies have 
pledged several billion dollars in aid, but much of the money has not yet been 
delivered, U.S. officials said.

<P>
It's a long way from Birobidjian to Jerusalem, a journey of 10,000 miles and 
one that crosses between rival solutions to what was once delicately called the 
Jewish Problem. 
</P>
<P>
Birobidjian is known for its voracious mosquitoes and an attempt by dictator 
Josef Stalin to design a national home for Jews in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, the mosquitoes remain as hungry as ever, but Birobidjian's 
Jewish inhabitants, driven by fear of ethnic conflict, have begun to leave for 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The number of refugees who have come from Birobidjian is small -- only 400. 
</P>
<P>
But the exodus carries a heavy symbolic weight, a reflection of a dying 
experiment in distant Siberia and the pre-eminence of another in the eastern 
Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the influx from the Soviet Union is taking on epic proportions. 
Since January, 1990, Israel has received the highest number of immigrants in 
one year since 1949 -- about 187,000 people, most of them Soviet Jews, the 
government said Monday. Officials added that they expect the year's tally to 
reach 200,000 by Dec. 31. A million could come within three years. 
</P>
<P>
One family of immigrants from Birobidjian gave a flatly emphatic answer as to 
why. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing left for us in Birobidjian. So, we thought we would try 
Israel," said Haim Brenner, 36, a construction engineer and native of the far 
region that is twice Israel's size. 
</P>
<P>
Brenner, with his wife, Ahdova, and two daughters, were among the first Soviet 
Jews to leave Birobidjian for Israel. Both worked as construction engineers and 
both viewed with dismay the decline in building resulting from the Soviet 
Union's vast economic and political problems. 
</P>
<P>
In their perception of the dangers of a collapsing Soviet Union, they echo the 
tens of thousands of other Soviet Jews who have fled for both Israel and the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Brenners never considered coming to Israel until last year, when the first 
of a string of Zionist missionaries came by to preach the virtues of Israel and 
counter the deep impact of years of anti-Israeli propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
"We had only heard bad things about Israel for all our lives," said Ahdova 
Brenner. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials look upon the Soviet influx as a kind of salvation for 
Zionism, which is based on the hypothesis that Jews are destined to settle in 
the land of their ancient forebears. Following years of stalled immigration, in 
which an infusion of newcomers from Ethiopia was countered by a steady outward 
flow of emigrants, the Soviet arrivals came as a transfusion for a sickly 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the departures from Birobidjian, however few, highlight the failure 
of a project that some say was doomed from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Birobidjian, officially called the Jewish Autonomous Region, sits near the 
border with China, across the Amur River from Manchuria. Stalin chose the 
location less for how it would serve to protect Jewish society from 
anti-Semitic outbursts in the Soviet Union than how it might benefit his 
empire's defenses in the sparsely settled Far East. 
</P>
<P>
Some Jewish citizens and Communist party officials lobbied for a more 
hospitable location -- the Crimea, for instance -- but even as disease drove 
half of the first trickle of migrants away, Mosocw insisted that Birobidjian be 
the Jewish home. 
</P>
<P>
"The Jewish people now face the great task of preserving its nationality," said 
Mikhail Kalinin, then the nominal head of state. "Within a decade, Birobidjian 
will be the most important and probably the only bulwark of national Jewish 
socialist culture." 
</P>
<P>
For a while, the dream held some luster. About 20,000 Jews from the Soviet 
Union, joined by a smattering from abroad, including British-held Palestine 
where Zionists were busy trying to establish farming settlements, settled in 
Birobidjian. 
</P>
<P>
One pioneer, Hannah Goldstein, now 84 and interviewed in Birobidjian by the 
Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot, recalled: "There was a great deal of 
excitement. We built the foundation of a Jewish state built on equality. There 
wasn't much food . . . but a lot of fish in the river." 
</P>
<P>
In a rush of national and cultural fervor, Yiddish along with Russian was 
adopted as the official language, a Yiddish newspaper was published and a 
library of Jewish literature built and named for Sholem Aleichem, the Ukrainian 
teller of Yiddish tales. Yiddish was viewed as preferable to Hebrew, the 
language promoted by Zionists. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish farmers set up collectives and Jews took up key official village and 
town posts. 
</P>
<P>
Early enthusiasm was sunk not just by the legendary cold, nor the difficult 
marshland farming, nor the preposterously distant geography, but rather by 
Stalin's cruel political purges which decimated the region's leadership and 
drove many Jews back to their former homes. 
</P>
<P>
World War II further blocked development, although in the war's aftermath, 
poverty and dislocations in the Soviet west pushed refugees to Birobidjian. 
</P>
<P>
One of them was Ahdova Brenner's father, Leonid Katzman, who after the war 
returned to his ruined home and fields in the Crimea under Ukrainian 
occupation. Rather than do battle in a desperate situation, he fled for the 
Jewish homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us it was paradise on earth. Propaganda, of course, but we went 
anyway," said Katzman, who with his wife Rosa came to Israel with his daughter 
and son-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
The reality was a town of two stone buildings and a few shacks built on ground 
so marshy that people had to walk on wooden runways to get around. "Swamp, 
swamp, swamp, swamp," is the way Katzman, 65, remembers it. 
</P>
<P>
Haim Brenner's parents made a similar postwar odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
"When they came, there were no warm clothes, no beds," recounted Haim. "They 
used to sleep wrapped in newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish population of Birobidjian surged to 30,000 and in Soviet official 
lore, settlement took on heroic dimensions. "There are also burning 
enthusiasts, ready to give up everything to live there . . . among them a 
former Palestinian patriot (who) although in his 50s, hustles about during the 
day and is sleepless at night hoping to see his new enterprise come true," a 
Soviet Jewish author wrote. 
</P>
<P>
But another purge crushed the new seeds of Soviet Jewish nationalism: Writers 
were sent to jail, the Jewish theater in Birobidjian was closed, Yiddish was 
dropped from school curricula, and books were officially removed from the 
Sholem Aleichem Library. Just about all that was left of the region's Jewish 
character were the stamps in the residents' passports that said "Jew" and the 
Yiddish newspaper that printed the latest Communist Party directives. 
</P>
<P>
"Their idea of a synagogue was to paste the sign 'Synagogue' on an empty 
building," said Katzman, a former accountant. "When one burned down, they put 
the sign on another one. It was for tourists to see and say, 'Look, they've got 
a synagogue.' " 
</P>
<P>
Relative stability after Stalin's death failed to revive Birobidjian. Gone were 
the burning enthusiasts. In 1958, Nikita S. Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, 
admitted in an interview that Birobidjian was a failure, but he blamed the 
fiasco on a supposed Jewish dislike for collective labor. 
</P>
<P>
The Jewish population eventually shrunk to a tiny minority, 4%, of the region's 
population of 100,000. The lone synagogue was in shambles and shared between an 
occasional Jewish worshiper and a Christian sect that celebrated the Sabbath. 
Still, top Communist Party and administrative posts were left in Jewish hands 
and the place was nominally reserved for Jewish settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know anything about Jewish rituals or holidays; there were no 
circumcisions. We were Jewish by nationality but nothing else," remembered 
Ahdova Brenner, 33. 
</P>
<P>
The word Israel was taboo, reflecting the heated rivalry between the Zionist 
idea of establishing a permanently separate state and the Marxist view that 
regions and republics of whatever nationality would eventually merge into a 
nation of workers. 
</P>
<P>
During the years of Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, high school students were 
encouraged to inform on anyone expressing an interest in Israel, the Brenners 
said. Once Ahdova Brenner asked about the chances for learning Hebrew and a 
teacher retorted, "Why Hebrew? Why not Yiddish?" 
</P>
<P>
The repressive atmosphere changed somewhat with Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's decision to ease emigration for Soviet Jews. At first, most Jews 
fled for the United States. But under home pressures to curb refugee traffic 
and appeals from Israel not to lure Jewish migrants away from Israel, the Bush 
Administration limited Soviet Jewish influx to 50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The limit coincided with brush-fire fears that a wave of anti-Semitism, pushed 
by nationalist unrest, would sweep the Soviet Union, In the Russian Republic, 
Jews were threatened by anti-Semitic eruptions. In non-Russian republics where 
dormant nationalisms have come alive, Jews were resented not only as Jews, but 
lumped with other groups as outsiders and told to go. The result: a mountain of 
applications to migrate to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Neither anti-Semitism nor ultra-nationalism seem to have infected faraway 
Birobidjian, with its mixed population of Russians and central Asians. Still, 
rumor of unrest elsewhere was enough to spur some anxiety among the Jews there. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured that if it was happening in Leningrad and Moscow, it would 
eventually happen here," said Haim Brenner. 
</P>
<P>
Information on Israel began to trickle in. Officials from the Jewish Agency and 
other immigrant promotion groups began to fan out in the Soviet Union to 
encourage Jews to go to Israel. At a meeting in Birobidjian during Passover, 
hundreds of questioners at two meetings peppered an Israeli delegate with their 
doubts. 
</P>
<P>
Is there work? Housing? Will we get skin cancer from the sun? Can you drink the 
water? 
</P>
<P>
Some voiced worry over the conflict with the Palestinians and were answered 
with the evasive perspective that the conflict had been going on for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
One Israeli praised the virtues of living on settlements in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip, but said that the newcomers would have to make up their own minds. 
</P>
<P>
A concern much on the minds of the potential migrants was whether they and 
their families would be considered Jewish enough to fit into Israeli society. 
Many Jews and non-Jews had intermarried. What would be the status of the 
spouses and children? Reports of opposition to letting in Jews of mixed 
heritage intensified the worries, as did stories of difficulties in conversion. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to tell them there would be no split families. That fitting-in 
depended mostly on learning Hebrew," said Yair Plessar, a biologist who 
volunteered to travel to Birobidjian and hold the Passover seminar. "I don't 
think they left completely satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
The Birobidjian government tried to counter the Israeli pitch with the argument 
that Israel is not so great. One party official traveled to Israel at Israeli 
government expense on a "friendship" trip and returned home to write a scathing 
article in the local paper describing Israel as a mess. Katzman was described 
as missing Birobidjian so much, he "spits" on Israel, while Haim Brenner was 
reported to be reduced to begging to get by. 
</P>
<P>
"Forget glasnost. They still tell lies," was Katzman's response. 
</P>
<P>
Katzman said he believes Jewish officials in Birobidjian oppose emigration 
because if all the Jews leave, they will lose their posts. The Brenners claim 
that Soviet citizens who once had their Jewish identity changed to Russian on 
their identification cards are trying to have former identities reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
The Brenners settled contentedly in a small apartment on Jerusalem's south 
side, replete with comforts hard to come by in the Soviet Union: a color 
television and a full refrigerator. Their rent and expenses for the first year 
are paid by the government. 
</P>
<P>
They had made the trip from the Soviet Union last spring, a five-day journey 
that included an 18-hour plane flight from Birobidjian to Moscow, a layover in 
Budapest and a final flight to Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
Their command of Hebrew has progressed rapidly, but the Brenners have been 
unable to find jobs equal to their training. In the meantime, they are painting 
houses part-time. 
</P>
<P>
Despite having set foot on two clear landscapes of the Jewish dream of 
nationhood, the family as a whole is somewhat ambivalent about the deeper 
meaning of their journey. Ahdova takes a philosophical line: 
</P>
<P>
"Israel is the only place for the Jews," she states flatly. 
</P>
<P>
Her father's reasoning, by way of contrast, was highly personal. 
</P>
<P>
"My child came, so I came," he said.

Senior leader Deng Xiaoping made his first public appearance since July, voting 
Wednesday in citywide elections in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The 86-year-old leader, believed to be suffering from cancer, appeared frail. 
</P>
<P>
Deng was shown on state television moving steadily but a bit shakily to the 
voter registration table. His daughter held his arm as he walked to the ballot 
box and dropped in his ballot. However, the official New China News Agency 
described Deng as walking vigorously to the polling station in Beijing.

HEATED U.S.-PANAMA BANKING FEUD MAY FURTHER CONFOUND RELATIONS;

<P>
DIPLOMACY: ENVOYS FROM BOTH COUNTRIES CAN'T SEEM TO BRIDGE THE CULTURAL CHASM 
WHEN IT COMES TO MONEY.

PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two aging men stood in the center of a large room crowded with stunned 
diplomats and shouted at each other. One was the American ambassador, the other 
Panama's foreign minister. It seems that every time they meet these days they 
end up yelling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's embarrassing, on one hand," said a European diplomat who witnessed the 
confrontation between Ambassador Deane R. Hinton and Panamanian Foreign 
Minister Julio Linares at a reception at the Vatican Embassy this year. "But 
it's also funny, maybe the best show in town. It's like unexpectedly walking in 
on a married couple in the middle of a fight over sex: You know it's rude to 
stay but you just can't leave." 
</P>
<P>
That's not a bad analogy, the image of two nations presumed to have almost 
identical interests bitterly arguing over one of the oldest of conflicts -- 
only in this case, it is money. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the disagreement are American attempts to make millions of 
dollars of aid conditional on being given access to secret bank accounts in 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Hinton said the heat generated by the dispute reflects "the chemistry of the 
two people involved. . . . We do seem to set each other off." 
</P>
<P>
Yet officials of both countries, diplomats and other experts say that it's not 
just a clash of personalities and conflict over one policy question. It also 
involves different, often opposing perspectives about each nation's political, 
economic and cultural systems. 
</P>
<P>
These differences are so deep that if not reconciled they promise to further 
confound Panamanian-American relations at a crucial time. Panama is trying to 
overcome the devastation of more than 20 years of dictatorship and the U.S. 
invasion a year ago, while the United States seeks to use this tiny Central 
American country as a bulwark against the tidal wave of international drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
The specific cause of the dispute goes by the awkward acronym MLAT, for Mutual 
Legal Assistance Agreement. This is a congressionally mandated condition for 
U.S. foreign aid, usually aimed at gaining access into the recipient nation's 
banking records. Such pacts already exist to one degree or another with the 
Bahamas, Mexico, Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. 
</P>
<P>
The United States says that it will withhold $84 million of the $420 million in 
direct aid voted this year unless Panama signs an MLAT permitting American 
officials to inspect Panamanian banking records in pursuit not only of 
launderers of drug money but also tax evaders and others engaging in such 
activities as insider stock trading. 
</P>
<P>
Hinton indicated that the lack of an agreement could endanger the entire aid 
package if Congress retaliates by withdrawing those parts due to be implemented 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"No problem," said Guillermo (Billy) Ford, Panama's second vice president and 
its minister of economy and planning. "My personal point of view is that Panama 
needs an MLAT. . . . We should sign because we are clean and have nothing to 
hide." 
</P>
<P>
Exactly, said Hinton and negotiators sent from Washington. If Panama has 
nothing to hide, an agreement should be easy. In fact, one U.S. official said, 
signing would benefit the country by removing any lingering doubts that the 
current government is tainted by the corruption of former dictator Manuel A. 
Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Unspoken is an American attitude that since the United States liberated Panama 
from Noriega's tyranny, Panama should be willing to agree to Washington's 
proposals, particularly since that would help in the war on drugs. And, indeed, 
the two nations did initial an agreement last August. Although the details have 
never been made public, it reputedly allowed U.S. officials access to bank 
records in search of people charged with violating a variety of so-called 
"fiscal crimes" in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't hold up. Claiming that the pact was an unacceptable infringement of 
Panamanian sovereignty and that National Assembly approval was thus precluded, 
Linares persuaded President Guillermo Endara to repudiate it. That decision 
wasn't unaffected by an extensive, well-organized effort by the nation's 130 
banks and their retainers in the legal trade. American access to records of the 
billions of dollars deposited here, much of it with the acknowledged aim of 
evading taxes, would be a threat to their business. 
</P>
<P>
"Panama isn't called a tax haven for nothing," said one banker. "That's why 
people come here." 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners' deposits totaled as much as $40 billion before Noriega so angered 
the United States with his involvement in drug trafficking and money laundering 
that it tried to oust him by applying economic sanctions against Panama. Even 
now, bank deposits stand at $14 billion and growing. 
</P>
<P>
Linares, an international lawyer and longtime critic of what he sees as 
one-sided Panamanian concessions in past negotiations over the Panama Canal, 
has said he supports an agreement restricted to drug trafficking and money 
laundering, but that the Americans want to go way beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
"They want us to go beyond matters that are crimes in both countries to include 
acts that are crimes in the United States but not here," said Ruben Carles, a 
former head of Chase Manhattan Bank's Panama operations and now the country's 
controller general. 
</P>
<P>
It is here that the disagreement reflects more than a difference over policy 
and a way of life and doing business that is alien to American legal and 
ethical concepts. 
</P>
<P>
Carles and Ford both point to tax shelters and insider stock trading as 
examples. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither is illegal here," Carles said in an interview in his skyscraper office 
overlooking the Pacific end of the canal. "Why should the United States care 
about money in Panama banks that is deposited from Bogota or Buenos Aires or 
London, even if that money is U.S. dollars from companies ultimately owned by 
Americans?" 
</P>
<P>
No taxes are paid on that money in Panama so the banks themselves can make more 
money from it. Accordingly, they can afford to offer higher interest rates, 
which in turn are not taxed. It is a combination that attracts even more 
deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Insider trading is a "way of doing business here," said Ford, whose animated 
manner and American-tinged English nearly overwhelm visitors. "When a company 
is going to declare a dividend, we call friends to tell them to buy stock." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Carles described insider trading: "If you don't do it, you don't get 
along." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "Anyway, the other issues are not serious problems. We have stopped 
the drug-connected money laundering . . . (but) the United States believes 
everything is connected to cocaine, and this treaty says that the United States 
sees Panama as it was during the Noriega regime." 
</P>
<P>
Another factor that gives the Panamanians "bile," as Endara put it, is that 
Panama's corporation and tax laws are based on U.S. statutes and, in the case 
of tax shelters, were written by Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"Our corporation laws are a spinoff of the Delaware tax laws of 1827 or '28," 
Carles said. "Our laws (on tax havens) were designed in 1925 by John Foster 
Dulles to evade U.S. restrictions on American businesses operating overseas." 
</P>
<P>
(Dulles was a prominent American lawyer who served as secretary of state under 
President Dwight D. Eisenhower.) 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Americans want to change all that for domestic political reasons -- 
the drug war -- "in a way that will put us at a competitive disadvantage and 
seriously damage our economy," Carles said. 
</P>
<P>
It's an important point for Panama. Banking here employs 10,000 people directly 
and benefits the rest of the country in a major way by providing financing for 
local growth. 
</P>
<P>
"The American aid is valuable and we need it, but it is a one-shot deal, so we 
won't be pressured into signing" an agreement, Carles said. Or, as Ford put it: 
"Panama can't give itself away." 
</P>
<P>
Hinton, who favors stockinged feet and cigars during the interviews given in 
his hilltop residence overlooking the Bay of Panama, dismissed such concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there will be any adverse effects on the banking industry from 
this agreement," he said. The real problem is "a number of interest groups 
(bankers) who don't want any agreement and have blown it out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
It is this sort of attitude that drives Linares to distraction and loud public 
attacks on Hinton. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere was so bad here recently that Panamanian officials and insiders 
spread the word that the U.S. Embassy was plotting to embarrass and weaken the 
Endara government. One account held that the United States had leaked 
information that the president was financially linked to a bank with drug 
connections. Another blamed the Americans for spreading word of a budding sex 
scandal involving Endara's wife to put him under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Hinton denied all such charges, and even that the United States is applying 
pressure. "One guy's pressure is another guy's persuasion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And in spite of his tough words and abrasive manner, Hinton indicated that the 
Americans will modify their bargaining position. 
</P>
<P>
"As a political fact of life, we have to make some changes," he said. "We have 
to show some flexibility."

ZOO'S CARE OF ELEPHANTS CRITICIZED; 
</P>
<P>
ANIMALS: HUMANE SOCIETY LETTER IS PROMPTED BY DEATH OF AN ANIMAL THAT FELL INTO 
MOAT. A SPOKESMAN DENIES CONDITIONS ARE 'GROSSLY INADEQUATE.'

In a letter to the San Diego Zoo, investigators at the Humane Society of the 
United States contended Wednesday that the zoo's elephant exhibit is inadequate 
and "extremely dangerous" for both the huge mammals and their keepers. 
</P>
<P>
The open letter to Doug Meyers, director of the San Diego Zoological Society, 
was prompted by the death Sunday of Maya, a 51-year-old Asian elephant. Zoo 
officials ordered that Maya be killed after being crippled by a fall into an 
elephant yard moat. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not question the care Maya received after her tragic fall, nor the fact 
that euthanasia was the humane decision to make on her behalf," wrote David K. 
Wills, a vice president in the Humane Society's Department of Investigations. 
"However, we are concerned as to what steps zoo officials are going to take to 
improve conditions for the surviving elephants." 
</P>
<P>
Wills contended that there are uninsulated floors and insufficient heat inside 
the barn-like structure and that the exhibit provides limited outdoor shelter. 
He also questioned the daily reliance on chains to restrain the elephants and 
called for widening of the catwalk connecting two parts of the elephant yard. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Jouett, a spokesman for the zoo, acknowledged that the nearly 30-year-old 
elephant yard is "not perfect," but he said the zoo is improving it. Shade 
trees have been planted and decaying floorboards replaced, he said. The zoo 
also plans to widen the catwalk. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett rejected Wills' charge that Maya might be alive if the catwalk were 
wider, saying no one witnessed her fall or her position on the walkway. He also 
denied that the exhibit, which houses one African and three Asian elephants, is 
"grossly inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
"It has passed USDA inspections and we'll welcome the USDA to come look at it 
again," Jouett said, noting that Wills has asked the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture to investigate the exhibit. He called most of Wills' allegations 
"exaggerations to catch the public's attention. It makes nice quotes but it's 
just not true." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Homer Malaby, a USDA animal-care specialist in Sacramento, said he will 
visit the zoo next week to investigate the Humane Society's allegations.

SHADES OF GRAY: TIMELY TIPS; 
</P>
<P>
PRECAUTIONS CAN GO A LONG WAY FOR HOME, PERSONAL SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
We who are past 50 find it hard to believe that so much crime has developed 
since the days when we never locked our doors. We tend to worry that we are 
vulnerable, that we are being taken advantage of more frequently than younger 
people. 
</P>
<P>
Most of us rely on the police and sheriff's departments for help in emergencies 
and protection against crime. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Konczal, police officer with Escondido's Crime Prevention unit, remembers 
the day when a police officer even had time to answer a call to rescue a cat 
out of a tree. "We would still do it, but we can't . . .," he said. The 
explanation is buried in crime statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, according to Konczal, the suspicious natures and observant eyes of 
the "shades of gray" generation can be significant sources of help to the 
police. We are quick to note when something is awry, out of the ordinary. 
Detecting a problem or merely suspecting one often leads to action. 
</P>
<P>
A fair number of newer adult communities today have private security patrols. 
It is like wearing a belt and suspenders: members are protected both by the 
patrol and by the sheriff's or police department. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Woods supervises private security in the community of Lake San Marcos, 
tucked between Carlsbad and San Marcos. TVs, VCRs, CD players and small 
electrical appliances, items that can be quickly and safely turned into cash, 
are occasionally taken from homes in this enclave with a mostly over-50 
population. Frequently, a raid on the refrigerator accompanies the crime. 
According to Woods, the thieves are looking not for snacks, but for "cold cash" 
which they know is often stashed in the fridge. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing on their experiences in North County, Woods and Konczal offered a 
number of security tips that may be especially appropriate for older men and 
women, many of whom live alone: 
</P>
<P>
* Although alert observers, many mature folks hesitate to bother the officers 
late at night, waiting politely until the following day to report last 
evening's prowler or strange noises. Unfortunately, that is usually too late. 
</P>
<P>
* Those who have alarm systems in their homes need to remember that the system 
does not catch the thief, it only frightens him or her away. A control panel in 
the bedroom eliminates the need to move outside of the house to read indicators 
and push buttons. (It is also a good idea to have a lock on the bedroom door.) 
Do not have the alarm panel visible from the outside: the little green light is 
a welcome mat: "Come on in," it beckons, "the system is off, no warning will 
sound." 
</P>
<P>
* If you have a circuit-breaker panel on the outside of your house, be sure it 
is locked: if anyone can open that box and fool with the lights, that act draws 
you outdoors and invites mischief. 
</P>
<P>
* A Neighborhood Watch program is as effective as the residents' participation 
in it. The program encourages neighbors to keep an eye on one anothers' homes. 
It is not helpful, however, merely to watch while a neighbor's TV is being 
hauled away; alert the police immediately and share with them any 
identification of the thieves and/or their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
I am particularly sensitive to that advice. Years ago, in Los Angeles, while 
our apartment neighbors sat at the pool and watched, a stranger entered our 
front door and left soon after, his pockets filled with jewelry and precious 
keepsakes. Everyone knew we were at work, but it never occurred to them that 
something in that scene was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
* There are numerous areas in North County where one can safely walk about at 
night. It is wise, though, to carry identification. 
</P>
<P>
Woods told the story of a man reported to the police as a suspected prowler. 
When confronted by police, he had no identification and reacted angrily to the 
investigating officer. They had an altercation; the man pulled out a knife. 
Fortunately, no one was hurt. The "prowler" was eventually identified as a 
resident of the area. When he was released from custody, he returned and 
apologized to the security officer. 
</P>
<P>
* If you have the feeling that someone is following behind you in a parking lot 
or sidewalk at night, walk toward the light, do not hesitate to scream when 
feeling endangered, run if you can. Call the sheriff if a phone is available. 
When driving, go to the nearest police station, busy gas station or market. 
Honk your horn all the way. 
</P>
<P>
* A woman should be wary of a man who stops her with an obscene remark; as she 
turns away in embarrassment, he can (and often does) grab her purse. If, by 
chance, someone does go after your purse, it is better for your health and 
safety to let it go. 
</P>
<P>
* In the car, do not place a wallet or pocketbook on the seat or on the floor 
when driving. It is easy to open the door and grab it. The floor in the back of 
the car is less visible, but the trunk is best. 
</P>
<P>
* When possible, shop with a friend; it is more fun and safer, too. Carry as 
little cash as possible and do not burden yourself with so many packages that 
you impede your ability to maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
* Most home burglaries occur during the morning hours. Answer the door but 
don't open it; let strangers know someone is home. 
</P>
<P>
* Beware of phone solicitors who ask a lot of questions: how many are in your 
household; what appliances do you have; how many and what make are your cars? 
The questions might sound innocent; the answers are chock full of information 
that can be used to your disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
* If someone has entered your home, try to get to a phone and call the police. 
Don't try to be a hero. 
</P>
<P>
* The Crime Prevention Center in Sacramento publishes a fistful of brochures 
that deal with everyday problems, tips for seniors, personal security, elder 
abuse, telephone fraud, etc. If the Crime Prevention material cannot be 
obtained from your local police department, write to Crime Prevention Cener, 
Office of the Attorney General, P.O. Box 944255, Sacramento 94244-2550.

A HEALTHY CHOICE OF HOSPITALS;

Where do you want to have your baby? Your face lift? Your back surgery? 
Hospital patients who have the luxury of time increasingly have the luxury of 
choices. As North County's population has grown, so has the potential to check 
out the hospital you'll be checking into. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to considering the medical advice of their physicians, patients can 
also evaluate a hospital based on its ambience, its services and its cost. The 
right hospital might not necessarily be the one closest to home. 
</P>
<P>
North County's five hospitals: 
</P>
<P>
* Tri-City Medical Center in Oceanside, the area' largest and busiest. 
</P>
<P>
* Palomar Medical Center in Escondido, the area's only trauma center. 
</P>
<P>
* Pomerado Hospital in Poway, attached to a 149-bed skilled nursing facility. 
</P>
<P>
The Pomerado and Palomar hospitals are administered jointly by the 
Palomar-Pomerado Health System. 
</P>
<P>
* Scripps Memorial Hospital in Encinitas, which says it's putting hospitality 
back into hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
* Fallbrook Hospital, the area's smallest, but which has managed to produce its 
own baby boom. 
</P>
<P>
As they scramble to attract and serve patients, the hospitals are offering a 
variety of new programs and amenities. 
</P>
<P>
If North County's hospitals are becoming more innovative, there is good 
motivation, according to George Belch, chairman of the marketing department at 
San Diego State University. "Everybody sees that it's the growth area of San 
Diego and that the population is somewhat more affluent. Hospitals do strategy 
planning and market analysis like any corporation." 
</P>
<P>
Like all large institutions, hospitals can be bruised by bad publicity and can 
be aggressive in seeking good community relations. "It's a competitive 
environment," said Alain Jourdier, director of communications for the twin 
Palomar-Pomerado system. 
</P>
<P>
The marketing budget last year for Palomar-Pomerado was $1.5 million -- which 
included money for advertisements, brochures, health fairs and other 
promotions. Tri-City Medical Center spent around $400,000. Fallbrook's budget 
for marketing was less than $200,000, and Scripps-Encinitas said it spent 
$88,000. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps-Encinitas is a private, nonprofit institution, while the other four 
North County hospitals are public, meaning they were established by the 
community and are governed by boards elected by district residents in much the 
same way that school boards are. Local taxes usually provide only a fraction of 
a multimillion-dollar annual budget. Patient and insurance revenues, plus 
fund-raising monies, provide the balance. 
</P>
<P>
All of the hospitals have either just completed expansions or have blueprints 
for growth in the works. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps plans to build a major new medical center in San Marcos. Kaiser 
Permanente, which operates clinics in Carlsbad and Escondido, is considering 
construction of a 100-bed hospital somewhere between Escondido and Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
As the hospitals respond to the growing North County population -- one that is, 
in general, insured rather than indigent -- they are striving to distinguish 
themselves by the quality and quantity of services offered. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TRI-CITY MEDICAL CENTER 
</P>
<P>
4002 Vista Way, Oceanside 
</P>
<P>
Calls: 724-8411 
</P>
<P>
Beds: 451 
</P>
<P>
Staff: 2,000 
</P>
<P>
Annual admissions: 18,084 
</P>
<P>
A room service program run by the hospital's 700 auxiliary volunteers will 
deliver VCRs and videos and even help patients write letters. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-City Medical Center prides itself on providing services like a posh hotel, 
according to Jennifer Velez, public relations coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
A room service menu may be used by patients or their guests for hamburgers, 
chocolate chip cookies, herbal teas and other snacks. "Haagen-Dazs ice cream 
bars and popcorn are most popular," said Velez. "The response has been great 
and the auxilians are very busy." 
</P>
<P>
So is the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
With more than 55,000 visits last year, Tri-City's emergency room was the most 
hectic in the entire county. The 451-bed hospital also chalked up 18,084 
admissions and delivered between 400 and 450 new babies each month. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-City offers a cancer center, cardiac care that includes an open-heart 
surgery unit, a chemical dependency department, a rehabilitation center, a 
neonatal intensive care unit, and an alternative birthing center among other 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
Tri-City has more than 2,000 doctors, nurses, administrators, technicians and 
others on staff. Its yearly payroll is about $87 million. 
</P>
<P>
One of the hospital's more innovative programs is its Day Treatment Center. The 
center, in a white clapboard house on Horne Street, is not a hospital setting, 
said Mary Wallace, manager of mental health services. 
</P>
<P>
The center is staffed by a psychiatrist, social worker, psychiatric nurse, 
occupational therapist and a recreational therapist. It offers comprehensive 
counseling and a range of activities for those who have suffered a traumatic 
incident, like the death of a spouse, or who are fighting depression, stress or 
anxiety, Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital also offers Hospice Services, a program designed to allow 
terminally ill patients to live out their last months at home, rather than in 
the hospital. Hospice provides in-home medical supplies, nursing visits, pain 
medication, and arranges to give family members some time away from the house. 
Hospice can also arrange help with legal and financial matters as well as grief 
and bereavement counseling for the patient and surviving family. 
</P>
<P>
In several departments at Tri-City, dogs are being used to make hospitalization 
a less threatening and intimidating experience. The animals, who are 
accompanied by their owners, are gentle, obedient and work with patients in the 
rehabilitation center, the mental health unit and with Hospice Services. 
Eventually dogs will be used in pediatrics, with cancer patients and in other 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
Because the hospital is performing more outpatient surgeries, which no longer 
require an overnight stay in the hospital, Tri-City offers a free service that 
provides rides to and from the hospital. The service is also available for 
appointments other than surgery to any patient living in Carlsbad, Oceanside, 
San Marcos and Vista. 
</P>
<P>
Expansion plans at Tri-City include a $20-million construction project that 
will triple the size of the emergency room by summer. A new central plant to 
supply heating, cooling and other technical needs will also be completed at 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
Construction plans for 1992 include building a surgery center that will be 
twice the size of the present facility; renovating and expanding the women's 
center; and building a 200-bed skilled nursing facility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PALOMAR MEDICAL CENTER 
</P>
<P>
555 East Valley Parkway, Escondido 
</P>
<P>
Calls: 739-3000 
</P>
<P>
Beds: 341 
</P>
<P>
Staff: About 1,800 
</P>
<P>
Annual admissions: 12,000 
</P>
<P>
Palomar is one of six trauma departments in San Diego County -- it is the only 
one in North County. 
</P>
<P>
A trauma department is different -- and more aggressive -- than a simple 
emergency room because the facility is always ready to give full immediate 
care, and the staff has been specially trained to deal with critical 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's crucial that people know there is a trauma center here," said Maureen 
Goehring, who directs the trauma department at Palomar. 
</P>
<P>
Victims of automobile and motorcycle accidents, falls and assaults are often 
rushed to trauma centers. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics summoned by 911 to the scene of an accident or other medical crisis 
will evaluate a patient based on a "CRAN" score. CRAN stands for circulation, 
respiration, abdominal movement and speech. That evaluation helps determine 
whether a patient will be sent to a trauma center. 
</P>
<P>
Before trauma centers were introduced to San Diego in 1985, emergency rooms 
were the only option. "If a patient was brought in at 9 p.m., you'd get pretty 
rapid care. However, if you came in at 3 a.m. and needed immediate surgery, a 
ruptured spleen for example, you'd have to get on the phone to find a surgeon 
at home and it could take from two to four hours. Patients were literally 
dying," said Goehring. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, patients brought to the trauma center have the support of an 
emergency room physician, a trauma surgeon, an anesthesiologist, a control 
nurse who supervises and coordinates events and a support nurse. There is also 
a staffer called a scribe who takes minute-to-minute notes. In addition, a 
neurosurgeon, a respiratory therapist, an X-ray technician, CAT scan 
technician, a pharmacist and a social worker are on call in the building. 
</P>
<P>
The trauma centers have reduced the preventable death rate in San Diego County 
from 36% to 2%, Goehring said. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar has between 1,000 and 1,200 trauma patients a year. 
</P>
<P>
Goehring said the members of the trauma staff are "adrenaline junkies. This is 
work that makes a difference in people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
Palomar Medical Center and Pomerado Hospital together have an annual payroll of 
about $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
A recent $50-million expansion program left Palomar with more beds, a larger 
emergency room and almost twice as many operating rooms, including open-heart 
surgery and spinal surgery facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar's emergency room sees about 36,000 patients a year. The hospital has 
12,000 to 15,000 admissions a year to its 341-bed hospital, and had about 3,600 
births in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Its programs include a heart center where the cardiologist works with a 
physical therapist, dietitian, social worker and home health nurse as a team. 
</P>
<P>
A birth center has 26 private "birthing suites," rooms with pink flowered bed 
spreads and rose-colored curtains designed to provide the comforts of home. 
</P>
<P>
Palomar also has a patient advocate service. Bob Crawford, director of 
marketing, said the patient advocate serves as "an ombudsman to interact, 
intercede and assure a patient of satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
POMERADO HOSPITAL 
</P>
<P>
15615 Pomerado Road, Poway 
</P>
<P>
Calls: 485-6511 
</P>
<P>
Beds: 130 
</P>
<P>
Staff: About 700 
</P>
<P>
Annual admissions: 6,000 
</P>
<P>
There are only private rooms at the 130-bed Pomerado, but patients are billed 
at semi-private rates, said Karen Barron of Pomerado Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"Our size is our advantage," she said. "We provide state-of-the-art equipment 
in a very personalized setting." 
</P>
<P>
Among the options available to patients: the Rx Pets program, which allows dog 
visits to rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Pomerado Hospital and Palomar Medical Center together have an annual payroll of 
about $80 million. 
</P>
<P>
Some 20,000 patients visited Pomerado's emergency room last year. There were 
about 6,000 admissions, 34,700 outpatients, and more than 1,600 births. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Pomerado, a 149-bed skilled nursing facility, is attached to the hospital 
by a corridor. It serves as a transitional environment for those just released 
from the hospital, and it also provides physical, occupational and speech 
rehabilitation therapy. 
</P>
<P>
The facility also offers respite care that allows home care-givers to take a 
break. A family member who is ill or disabled and needs support care can be 
temporarily checked into the facility while the primary care-giver is out of 
town or otherwise unable to offer care. 
</P>
<P>
Since September, Villa Pomerado has filled another role. 
</P>
<P>
It is now one of the only places in the county where rape victims receive 
treatment from specially trained nurses in a private environment. 
</P>
<P>
Police from all over the county work with Pomerado's sexual assault and 
response team, called SART. One room at Villa Pomerado is set aside for rape 
patients. "It is a lot less threatening an environment than an emergency room," 
said Barron. 
</P>
<P>
Six of Pomerado Hospital's nurses have been trained in evidence gathering 
techniques in sexual assaults. A social worker also is there to help the victim 
deal with the emotional trauma. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FALLBROOK HOSPITAL 
</P>
<P>
624 East Elder, Fallbrook 
</P>
<P>
Calls: 728-1191 
</P>
<P>
Beds: 50 
</P>
<P>
Staff: 300 
</P>
<P>
Annual admissions: 3,457 
</P>
<P>
At just 50 beds, Fallbrook Hospital is the smallest in North County. 
</P>
<P>
"The patient is not an account number, but an individual and is treated with 
dignity. That's something that comes through," said Don N. Larkin, Fallbrook 
Hospital's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
Last year there were 10,793 emergency room patients, 3,457 admissions, 10,904 
outpatient visits and 1,161 births. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook, which has a high number of births for its size, recently built a new 
maternity unit. 
</P>
<P>
In a $1.2-million addition completed last year, four new suites for labor, 
delivery and postpartum were added. Included in the project was an operating 
room and 12 nursery bassinets. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook Hospital's modest size lends it a flexibility that allows it to stay 
current, said Denise Stearns, chief marketing officer. As an example, she cited 
the pain management center that opened in October. 
</P>
<P>
The program was started by two physicians who received special training in 
treating chronic pain. 
</P>
<P>
The center outfits patients who have chronic pain, such as that caused by 
cancer, with a tiny pump that is placed under their skin and releases minute 
doses of painkiller directly into the spine. The amount of medication needed by 
using this method is much reduced and relieves the patient of many side 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to open the center was swift, said Stearns. "It's part of our 
mission to have a commitment to innovation. These are times in health care when 
you have to be ahead of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Other hospital programs include a diabetes support group, a sports injury 
clinic and a cardiac rehabilitation workshop. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital has a staff of 300 and an annual payroll of $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Fallbrook's 400-member auxiliary is active and offers free rides to and from 
the hospital and doctors' offices.

Calls: 753-6501 
</P>
<P>
Beds: 148 
</P>
<P>
Staff: 400 
</P>
<P>
Annual admissions: 4,000 
</P>
<P>
There is an atrium, mahogany furniture, flowers and open space in the lobby of 
Scripps Memorial Hospital-Encinitas. Other physical amenities: a secluded, 
comfortably furnished meditation room. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the root of the word hospital. It comes from hospitality," said C. 
Michael Dabney, director of media relations. "Yet, often people have a negative 
impression of the idea of a hospital. There's a lingering negative feeling, and 
so the more we can make the hospital seem like it's exuding personal care the 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 patients checked in to the Scripps Encinitas hospital last year. 
About 16,254 were seen in the emergency room, and about 7,000 were treated on 
an outpatient basis. The 148-bed hospital has a staff of more than 400 and paid 
out some $30 million in wages and benefits last year. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, Scripps completed a $17-million expansion that increased the 
number of beds from 93 to 146. 
</P>
<P>
It has a new eight-bed cancer center and 30-bed rehabilitation wing designed 
for stroke and head injury recuperation. 
</P>
<P>
A sauna and gymnasium help with physical therapy, and a transitional apartment 
is used to allow patients to relearn living skills, such as cooking and 
housecleaning. 
</P>
<P>
A further $5-million renovation begun over the summer will increase the surgery 
department by two operating suites; increase the number of beds in the 
intensive care/cardiac care unit from 8 to 20; and improve facilities in a 
number of other departments. 
</P>
<P>
Scripps is also planning to build a major medical complex in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Scripps has purchased 36 acres and intends to purchase about 30 more 
before breaking ground on the project next year. 
</P>
<P>
The first stage calls for construction of a clinic and doctors' offices. Later, 
construction would start on the hospital itself. 
</P>
<P>
The project will be paced according to the needs of the San Marcos community, 
according to Laurence Blagg, executive vice president of Scripps Hospitals.

STAFFS GUARD CUSTOMERS, KEEP CENTERS SPRUCED UP 
</P>

<P>
It takes plenty of behind-the-scenes effort, millions of dollars and hundreds 
of people to create those agreeable mall atmospheres that make South Bay 
shoppers want to buy, buy and buy. 
</P>
<P>
At the Carson Mall, four landscape workers spend five days each week watering 
the center's 3,000 plants, checking them for bugs and trying to repair the 
damage careless shoppers cause when they plunk their packages down in the 
greenery. 
</P>
<P>
Even with all that attention, however, the chrysanthemums that put you in a 
good mood this month most likely won't be the same ones you gaze at next month. 
The mall's artificial light requires that workers rotate plants constantly. 
</P>
<P>
The gleaming brass and shining floors of the Galleria at South Bay also require 
special attention. With all those sticky fingers grabbing at rails and tired 
feet tramping between stores, it takes a crew of six people all night, every 
night, to clean up after customers. In addition, a private contractor earns 
$12,000 each year just to keep the mall's 600-foot-long glass ceiling 
sparkling. 
</P>
<P>
When unusual transformations are to take place, extra hands are brought in to 
create new treats for shoppers' eyes. 
</P>
<P>
At Christmastime, workers shut down the Galleria's geyser-like central fountain 
-- which shoots water 80 feet into the air -- to make way for an elaborate 
Santa stage, visible from all three floors of the mall. 
</P>
<P>
The workers who hang the cheery cherubs and bright ribbons of Christmas make up 
only a portion of the 50 people the mall employs to maintain its ambience. The 
Galleria also keeps six administrative staff members and 12 security guards 
busy and helps the city to pay for the 24 Redondo Beach police officers 
assigned to mall beats. 
</P>
<P>
At Hawthorne Plaza, the 25-member security staff keeps an eye on the place day 
in and day out. Several officers use an observation tower that overlooks the 
mall parking area. 
</P>
<P>
"One operator in the tower has been to court at least six times this year" to 
testify as a witness, said Bill Todd, the plaza's director of security. "He's 
so observant, he's spotted people just as they start to case (the cars) and 
actually caught people while they're still in the car taking things." 
</P>
<P>
Soon the plaza will install a closed-circuit television camera system to keep 
an even better eye on the mall's comings and goings. 
</P>
<P>
"The mall is a place to shop," Todd said. "We want to create an atmosphere 
where people can concentrate on doing that." 
</P>
<P>
At the Shops at Palos Verdes, visitors can also concentrate on watching patrons 
of a very unusual business tenant. Holiday shoppers on all three of the mall's 
levels can gaze down on a 160-foot-long ice skating rink that adjoins a 
courtyard area at the mall's northern end. 
</P>
<P>
For the first eight years the rink was in operation, shoppers could hear the 
skating music and feel wafts of cold air from off the ice as they moved from 
store to store. A few months ago, however, huge windows were installed to 
separate browsers from skaters. 
</P>
<P>
The windows "keep the ice in and the candy wrappers out," said rink manager 
Roxanne Watson. "It's a little nicer this way. . . . Spectators aren't tempted 
to see whether pennies actually do stick to the ice." 
</P>
<P>
They don't.

<P>
Catherine McLean says her idea of a good shopping trip is an outing at the 
Shops at Palos Verdes in Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting on a bench inside the mall one day last week with her daughter, the 
Palos Verdes Peninsula resident said that she avoids traveling to the massive 
Del Almo Fashion Center in Torrance, especially during the crush of the holiday 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Too many hassles with traffic and crowds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But at the Shops at Palos Verdes, the atmosphere is different, McLean said. For 
one thing, the sales people are helpful, she said. For another, "it's quiet." 
</P>
<P>
Originally called the Courtyard Mall when it opened in 1981, the center 
underwent a $3-million face lift last year aimed at attracting more shoppers -- 
and making the mall less quiet. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy was to shed the mall's image as a miniature version of the South 
Bay's other regional shopping centers and re-create it with specialty stores 
appealing to the buttoned-down, middle- and upper-middle-class people living on 
the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
"The people here really are conservative," said Mary Harris, the mall's 
director of marketing. "That's why they moved here. . . . We kind of compare it 
to a Connecticut or New England." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the mall, which is next to the 60-store, open-air Peninsula Center, 
tried to create a "whole new image" by bringing in small stores that sold 
quality merchandise. No Rodeo Drive chichi was allowed. No shops touting 
trendy, costly, here-today, gone-tomorrow goods. In came merchants such as 
Eddie Bauer, Williams-Sonoma, The Nature Co., The Bombay Co. and Talbots. 
</P>
<P>
Judging from last year's sales figures, the new stores have rejuvenated the 
mall, Harris said. Mall figures indicate Christmas sales in 1989 were up 40% 
from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, only time will tell if the make over will prove successful over the 
long haul. Harris concedes that the Shops at Palos Verdes are still in 
competition with upscale merchandisers situated in malls such as Del Almo and 
the South Bay Galleria. 
</P>
<P>
And on the peninsula, the center may face another challenge -- the so-called 
Hamburger Hill syndrome. The phrase refers to those people who move to the area 
because of its fine schools and semi-rural life style, but then wind up with 
little disposable income because of the area's high cost of housing. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, shopper Victor Carbone, who has lived in Rancho Palos Verdes for 
35 years, said he has already noticed a big change. He said he used to call the 
mall "disaster alley" because so few people were seen there. 
</P>
<P>
But judging from the number of shoppers there one recent Tuesday afternoon, 
those days may be over, he said. "Just look around. I've never seen this much 
traffic." SHOPS AT PALOS VERDES, ROLLING HILLS ESTATES Year opened: 1981 Retail

<P>
When 6-year-old Nicholas Boyette wanted to know if Santa Claus is white, his 
mother, Janice, came up with this reply: 
</P>
<P>
"I told him that the real Santa, when he goes to a white home, is white, and 
when he's visiting black children, he's black," the 35-year-old Inglewood 
mother said. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating such questions, Hawthorne Plaza hired two ethnic Santas this 
Christmas: a black Santa, Izorrie Petrus, 24, and a bilingual, Spanish-speaking 
Santa, Clemente Gomez, 27. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas, who is black, didn't care which Santa he visited: "I like them both," 
he said. But it made a difference to his mother, who regularly shops at the 
mall, and mall managers anticipated that, too. 
</P>
<P>
The Santas, along with mall brochures and ads with ethnically diverse models, 
are some of the ways Hawthorne Plaza has tried to reach out to its shoppers, 
who surveys show are 65% black, 18% Anglo, 15% Latino and 2% Asian. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, in honor of Black History Month, the center put up a 10-ton sand 
sculpture showing the faces of eight blacks who made strides in medicine, 
science, politics, the arts and athletics. It also staged Cinco de Mayo 
celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
The focus on cultural diversity is part of the plaza's strategy to 
differentiate itself from other South Bay malls, which have been less 
aggressive in targeting ethnic customers, General Manager William Demarest 
said. "You can't be everything to everybody," he said. "So our approach has to 
be as diverse as the community." 
</P>
<P>
The strategy has come not a moment too soon for many merchants at the plaza who 
have been disappointed by sagging sales in the past two years. Sales revenue 
declines of 40% were not uncommon this year, many said. 
</P>
<P>
There is little disagreement that the mall's reputation for attracting youths 
and gang members is a large part of the problem. "Many customers are afraid to 
come and shop here because of what goes on," said Mikhail Zib, who manages a 
jewelry store. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne police are called to the mall daily for petty thefts and several 
times a week for stolen cars and robberies, Sgt. Henry Mashack said. But he 
said the crime rate at the mall is no higher than in most areas of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Mall managers, however, are trying to create a safer, more attractive 
environment for shoppers and storefronts. Last year, the plaza boosted its 
security staff by 25% and began training officers in how to avert trouble 
before it starts. Now, as many as seven baton-wielding officers can be seen 
roaming together throughout the mall looking for hoodlums. 
</P>
<P>
The Hahn Co., which owns and manages the mall, also spent $420,000 this year to 
give the plaza a long-overdue face lift. The earth-toned buildings, which had 
begun to look shabby and dated, were spruced up with a bright coat of white 
paint. Teal-colored neon signs were installed, and several palm trees and poppy 
beds were planted around the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last few months, it's a lot cleaner and a lot safer," said Jack Park, 
owner of Jack's Mens Wear, a mall stalwart for 11 years. "We've always had a 
lot of problems with gangs, a lot of fighting. But it's been a lot better."

<P>
A decade ago, Manhattan Beach was well along in its transformation from quaint 
beach town to affluent community. But one thing that affluence demands -- a 
convenient shopping mall -- was missing. 
</P>
<P>
So in 1981, part of a Chevron USA tank farm gave way to the Manhattan Village 
Shopping Center. With its Mediterranean architecture, lush landscaping and 
emphasis on upscale stores, it deliberately played to the moneyed community 
around it. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a nice area. People have disposable incomes and they spend it," said 
John Burns, the mall's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the mall's 89 stores recorded taxable retail sales of almost $91 
million and ranked 23rd among Los Angeles County's 45 largest malls. 
</P>
<P>
From the start, Manhattan Village has had no regrets about not being the South 
Bay's biggest mall. It has sought shops that have few other outlets and has 
created an inviting, low-key atmosphere with an architecture marked by 
skylights, interior trees and a fountain populated by ceramic sea animals. 
</P>
<P>
Regular shopper Christine Seltzer said there is a feeling of being welcome. 
"The clerks know who you are and they respect you," she said. "You're not a 
number." 
</P>
<P>
Although chain stores such as Miller's Outpost clothing and B. Dalton books are 
a part of the mall, Manhattan Village also has Lucy Zahran, a fine china and 
crystal shop, and Seaport Unique Gifts, which has the South Bay's largest 
collection of Lladro ceramics and draws customers from as far away as 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
The mall also boasts St. Estephe, a four-star restaurant that utilizes French 
sauces and Southwestern ingredients such as red and green chilis and blue corn 
tortillas. With such delicacies as mushroom-filled chili rellenos in a garlic 
goat cheese sauce, the restaurant has established an international reputation, 
said manager Chris St. Marie. 
</P>
<P>
Although Manhattan Village is aimed at the affluent, Burns said its customers 
also include secretaries and white-collar workers in the nearby aerospace 
industries. Most customers come from within a mile of the center, he said. TRW 
shuttles employees to the center between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. on workdays 
so they can have lunch and shop. Hughes does the same thing during the 
Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
"Our lunch business is stronger than our business evenings and weekends," Burns 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of Manhattan Village opened in 1980 with a Ralphs Market and 
Sav-On Drug Store as major tenants. A year later, in October, 1981, the 
enclosed mall opened with Bullock's and Buffums as anchor stores. Rounding out 
the complex are restaurants, movie theaters, banks and offices. 
</P>
<P>
Some shoppers say this kind of diversity makes the center a one-stop dining, 
shopping and entertainment location. "There's a good selection here," said 
Shirley Lochner, who frequently visits the mall to "shop, walk and just see 
what's around." 
</P>
<P>
The center also lacks the frantic pace of larger malls, according to shopper 
Diane Christofferson. "It's never that overcrowded. If it were mobbed, I 
wouldn't like it." MANHATTAN VILLAGE SHOPPING CENTER, MANHATTAN BEACH Year

CAL STATE ROTC PROGRAM UNDER FIRE FOR POLICY ON GAYS; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: THE ACADEMIC SENATE AT LONG BEACH CAMPUS IS THE LATEST TO ACT AGAINST 
THE PROGRAM. ROTC OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE FOLLOWING FEDERAL RULES.

<P>
A squad of ROTC students at Cal State Long Beach spent a recent Tuesday 
preparing for war. 
</P>
<P>
They attended classes on military history and troop management, then stood at 
attention in a campus quad to hear announcements and salute their superiors. 
After marching in formation out to an athletic field, they performed a series 
of exercises, including push-ups and sit-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, however, the cadets and officials of the Reserve Officer Training Corps 
have been under verbal attack -- from an outspoken group of students and 
professors who want the program banned from campus because it discriminates 
against homosexuals, a violation of university policy. 
</P>
<P>
One of the critics, Jack Munsee, a physics professor, recently persuaded the 
campus Academic Senate, an advisory group of elected faculty representatives, 
to initiate proceedings that could eventually result in the program's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
"I never want it said of me that I was silent over this injustice," Munsee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
ROTC officials, most of whom are in the military, say they are following 
Defense Department rules banning gays from military service. Homosexual 
students are allowed to take ROTC classes for academic credit at Cal State Long 
Beach and most other colleges, but they are not eligible for the $100-per-month 
stipend that most upper-division participants receive. They also are not 
allowed to become regular cadets in their third year, the time when most 
participants promise to become military officers upon graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"We serve two masters, a civilian boss on campus and a military boss in 
(Washington)," said Lt. Col. Andrew Peterson, a professor of military science 
and director of the university's Army ROTC. "What we have here is a conflict 
between the Department of Defense and the university, with the ROTC in the 
middle." 
</P>
<P>
But he made it clear which master has more clout. "I have to enforce government 
policy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
ROTC students and administrators said their program provides a valuable service 
and ought to be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson pointed out that the ROTC contributes a stream of liberally educated 
officers with roots in civilian life. ROTC students and administrators also 
argue that an ROTC ban would discriminate against students who depend on the 
program for scholarships and to pave the way for a military career. Many of 
these students are minorities, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The ROTC controversy first erupted at Cal State Northridge, then spread to 
other California State University campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Northridge Faculty Senate voted to eliminate the ROTC program 
there because of its adherence to the Defense Department's anti-gay policy. 
Northridge President James W. Cleary eventually rejected the recommendation, 
citing an opinion by university lawyers that there was no legal basis for doing 
away with ROTC. 
</P>
<P>
Cleary wrote that, while he personally found the anti-homosexual policy 
"deplorable" and worthy of abolition, "banning an academic program simply 
because we are in disagreement with a policy of a profession which is serviced 
by this program is antithetical to the nature of an open university." 
</P>
<P>
The issue then was taken up by the state Academic Senate, consisting of faculty 
representatives from all 19 California State University campuses. The group 
adopted a resolution condemning the Defense Department and urged faculties of 
each campus to begin taking steps to remove the ROTC if the department policy 
is not rescinded by Jan. 1. Local ROTC officials say they have received no 
indication the department plans to change its policy. 
</P>
<P>
Faculty groups at Cal State Hayward, Cal State Pomona and Cal State Bakersfield 
have also passed anti-ROTC resolutions. One private institution, Pitzer College 
in Claremont, banned ROTC earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, each university president will decide ROTC's fate. 
</P>
<P>
Campus officer training programs throughout the country were attacked in the 
late 1960s and early 1970s by opponents of the Vietnam War. Some programs were 
closed, and others experienced dwindling enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
The first ROTC programs were established only six years ago at Cal State Long 
Beach, however. About 150 students participate in Army and Air Force ROTC 
programs on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Physics professor Munsee led the ROTC protest, and found support among members 
of the campus Gay and Lesbian Student Union, who cited studies that they said 
indicate that the presence of homosexuals in the military would not hamper 
national defense. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as there is discrimination going on for one person or small group of 
people, then it's possible for discrimination to go on against others," said 
Heather Haskell, the organization's treasurer. "We should fight discrimination 
on all levels." 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, after a spirited debate, the campus Academic Senate approved 
the resolution endorsing the state faculty's position and initiating the 
procedure for discontinuing ROTC. 
</P>
<P>
In accordance with university procedure, the group voted to form a committee to 
hold hearings on the issue and submit a report next fall to university 
president Curtis L. McCray, who will make the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
McCray says he has an open mind on the subject. "We are attempting to give 
everybody an equal shake and if any of our programs, either directly or de 
facto, have impact on students because of their differences, then (those 
programs) have to be looked at." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the ROTC students continue their program. While many say that 
they would have no personal qualms about serving on military duty with open 
homosexuals, opinion is somewhat divided on whether the government's anti-gay 
policy ought to be changed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they're a legitimate minority," said Joe Ingram, a 26-year-old 
political science major in the last semester of the four-year program. "These 
people have chosen to be a minority and therefore shouldn't receive the kind of 
benefits that legitimate minorities receive." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Pantano, a 28-year-old fine arts major who already has been commissioned 
as an Army lieutenant, disagrees. "Personally, I don't think sexual orientation 
should have anything to do with it," she said. "There are already a lot of 
slime-ball heterosexuals in the service." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the cadets acknowledge, however, that they are a bit concerned about 
ROTC's uncertain future on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"If worse comes to worse," said Joselito Sto Thomas, 28, "we'll just go to UCLA 
and drill over there. (But) that would be a major hassle."

<P>
Your children have 11 days of vacation left, and they're already bored. 
Luckily, there are things to do around town that are fun and educational. 
</P>
<P>
"Hamlet" is big in conversations about movies. But the film is also an 
educational experience because it is a retelling of one of William 
Shakespeare's most popular plays -- one that is read in most public high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Youngsters will like this version because it stars heartthrob Mel Gibson as 
Hamlet, while Lady Hamlet is played by Glenn Close, who also starred in "Fatal 
Attraction." 
</P>
<P>
Watching a genius's classic play performed by such popular actors for just a $4 
matinee ticket is unbeatable. Check the movie listings for a nearby theater. 
</P>
<P>
Another classic film is "Cyrano de Bergerac," based on the drama of romance and 
suspense by French playwright Edmond Rostand. This film is a fresh release from 
Orion Classics and opened on Christmas at Laemmle's Royal in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting the IMAX Theatre at the California Museum of Science and Industry is 
one of the best supplements to your child's science class. In fact, IMAX's 
latest film, "Blue Planet," will give your student views of Earth that he or 
she cannot find in a textbook. 
</P>
<P>
These pictures, shown on a five-story screen, cover an incredible visual range 
from 330,000 miles in space to 10,000 feet beneath the ocean's surface. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $5.50 for adults and $4 for children 4 to 17, senior citizens and 
students with identification. Call IMAX at (213) 744-2014. 
</P>
<P>
Rarely do children have a chance to actually witness and live history. But at 
Medieval Times in Buena Park, they can see what they have been reading about 
England's medieval period -- complete with knights in armor and damsels in 
distress. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors will eat an authentic medieval dinner (with their fingers!), while 
watching medieval entertainment, such as magic, horsemanship and jousting with 
real swords. 
</P>
<P>
Medieval Times also features a torture museum and collection of armor. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting Medieval Times is a splurge, though, because adult tickets are about 
$30 and children 12 and under get in for about $20. Call Medieval Times at 
(800) 438-9911. 
</P>
<P>
Give your child a new perspective on American history with a close-up look at 
World War II airplanes at the Museum of Flying in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Flying has on display 20 planes, including the 1924 Douglas World 
Cruiser, which circled the globe, and a replica of the Voyager space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
A variety of short films about planes and their roles in history show 
continuously every day. Your child may also tour the panoramic observation deck 
and airport runways. 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Flying is open Thursday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Admission is $4 for adults, $2 for children 13 to 17, and $1 for children 12 
and under. 
</P>
<P>
For a broader view of history, try the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, 
which covers 600 million years of Earth history. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone will find something interesting, since exhibits cover everything from 
dinosaur fossils and pre-Columbian art to animal and marine life, and even 
Snoopy's 40th birthday celebration. 
</P>
<P>
The Natural History Museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $5 for adults, $2.50 for students and senior citizens, $1 for 
children 5 to 12. Children under 5 are free. 
</P>
<P>
Enriching your child's study of the arts is easy in Los Angeles because we have 
the best of music, drama, dance and visual arts. 
</P>
<P>
The "Nutcracker" ballet is popular during the holidays, and several dance 
companies are performing it. Among them are the renowned Joffrey Ballet, whose 
performances at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion end Sunday. Tickets range from $8 
to $45. 
</P>
<P>
For lessons in arts, crafts and games, your child can try free programs offered 
by local parks this week and next. 
</P>
<P>
Supervised by adults, the program is for fourth- through eighth-graders only. 
It is open Monday through Friday, except New Year's Day, from noon to 4 p.m. 
Call (213) 458-8311 for the participating park near you. 
</P>
<P>
Physical education doesn't have to end when vacation begins, and there is a 
free program for that, too. 
</P>
<P>
Boys and girls in grades six through eight can enjoy football, basketball, 
volleyball and full use of the gymnasiums at Lincoln and John Adams middle 
schools in Santa Monica. This fitness program runs noon to 4 p.m. Monday 
through Friday, except New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
A ski trip is also planned, but it is not free. Call (213) 458-8311 to find out 
more.

PLEASANT TAP HAS TYPICAL BIG FINISH; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: HE COMES FROM 11 LENGTHS OFF THE PACE TO WIN MALIBU STAKES AS 
SANTA ANITA'S WINTER MEETING OPENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Pleasant Tap had a pleasant return to Santa Anita Wednesday, coming from far 
back to win the $112,600 Malibu Stakes by 1 1/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
It was last April that trainer Chris Speckert decided Pleasant Tap should 
bypass the Santa Anita Derby. Because the track favored front-runners, Speckert 
shipped his late-running colt East to prepare for the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
The plan made a lot of sense. Horses coming from off the pace were unable to 
overhaul Mister Frisky in the Santa Anita Derby, while Pleasant Tap ran a game 
second in the Lexington Stakes at Keeneland, and at 40-1 he finished third, 
behind Unbridled and Summer Squall, in the Kentucky Derby, which his sire, 
Pleasant Colony, had won nine years before. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Colony was also a Preakness winner, and two days before Pleasant Tap 
was to run in the second Triple Crown race, he suffered a tendon injury at 
Pimlico and was sent to Thomas Mellon Evans' Buckland Farm in Virginia to 
recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
After coming back in September, Pleasant Tap won only an allowance race in four 
starts. He was even switched from dirt to turf, and going 1 1/2 miles he ran 
eighth in the Breeders' Cup at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
But this is a different season and apparently it's a different Santa Anita, 
where horses were breaking down at an alarming rate this fall. There's less 
sand in the track's composition, and on Wednesday, as the track opened its 54th 
season with a crowd of 45,176, form was holding while horses won from on the 
lead as well as off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Tap was one of the latter, as he came from last place early, 11 
lengths behind the pace-setting Restless Con and Magical Mile, to win the 
Malibu with a powerful, sustained run on the far turn. 
</P>
<P>
Bedeviled, trying to give Chris McCarron his fourth win of the day, finished 
second, 1 1/2 lengths ahead of Due to the King. 
</P>
<P>
Next came Restless Con and Magical Mile, who was running for the first time in 
about nine months, and Profit Key, the 5-2 favorite, wound up sixth in the 
10-horse field that was reduced by the scratches of Past Prince and Burnt 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Tap, earning $67,600 and paying $9.40 to win, ran seven furlongs in 
1:21 3/5, which has been the winning time in the Malibu four of the last five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Solis rode Pleasant Tap, and when he returned a half-hour later to win the 
last race by a nose aboard Histrion, three San Gabriel Valley residents were 
$250,000 richer. 
</P>
<P>
Using a $64 ticket that included single plays in the second, fourth, seventh 
and ninth races, the trio picked all nine winners. Because the pick-nine pool 
was only $27,229, the winners normally would have received about $21,761, but 
Golden Eagle Insurance Co. paid them the approximate $228,000 difference based 
on a policy that Santa Anita had taken. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Golden Eagle Insurance is owned by John Mabee, who bred and 
owns Centennial Time and Personable Joe, respective winners of the third and 
fourth races. 
</P>
<P>
As Santa Anita had announced regarding a potential payoff a week ago, track 
officials and their insurer will review whether the $250,000 guarantee for nine 
winners is continued when racing resumes Friday. 
</P>
<P>
One of Wednesday's big winners said he had attended 40 of the last 42 opening 
days at Santa Anita. "I don't usually play the pick nine," he said, "but when I 
read that there was a guarantee of $250,000, I called my friends Tuesday night 
and said we should go out early and play it." 
</P>
<P>
Despite warmer weather, with temperatures in the 60s, the crowd was the 
smallest for a Santa Anita opener since 1977. The total attendance was also the 
smallest, by more than 5,000, for an opener since off-track betting started in 
1987. The last time Santa Anita opened on a Wednesday, in 1984, the crowd was 
almost 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant Tap has won four of 14 starts, all but one of the victories at Santa 
Anita. He broke his maiden in a stake, the Sunny Slope, in October of 1989, and 
he won an allowance on an off track in Arcadia last February. 
</P>
<P>
After the pre-Preakness injury, Pleasant Tap was sent to Ross Pierce, who 
trains for Evans in the East. Shortly after the Breeders' Cup on Oct. 27, the 
colt was sent back to Speckert, who saddled him for a second-place finish in 
the Native Diver Handicap at Hollywood Park on Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"This is satisfying," Speckert said Wednesday. "It's satisfying to bring this 
horse back, after the injury, after he ran a mile and half, and to have him win 
going seven-eighths. The Preakness injury might have been a blessing in 
disguise, because it was serious enough that we noticed it, but not serious 
enough to endanger his career. If we don't notice it, we might have run him and 
something very serious could have resulted." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the short distance, Speckert told Solis to drop back with Pleasant Tap 
as usual. "We're planning for a mile and a quarter (the Charles H. Strub on 
Feb. 10), so why try to be clever?" Speckert said. "This will be the last time 
this horse ever sees seven furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while, I didn't think the speed was coming back. There's a lot of 
difference in the track. I gallop horses, and I can tell that this is a safe 
track. The horses are getting a hold of it better." 
</P>
<P>
Solis, matching McCarron's three-victory day, rode Pleasant Tap for the first 
time in the Affirmed. 
</P>
<P>
"He seems to like it when you ride him hard," Solis said. "He finished great. 
He dropped way back and came flying home." 
</P>
<P>
Before the Strub, Pleasant Tap will run in the 1 1/8-mile San Fernando on Jan. 
19. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Henry Chavez, chairman of the California Horse Racing Board, and Dennis 
Hutcheson, the board's executive secretary, met with a group of trainers at 
Santa Anita on Wednesday. "We were interested in better communication with the 
racing board and it was a good meeting," said Don Johnson, who represents the 
horsemen. Johnson said that the board is developing guidelines for handling the 
several recent cases involving trainers whose horses tested positive for 
cocaine. The full board will have a special meeting Jan. 11 in Los Angeles to 
discuss the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Marje Everett and R.D. Hubbard, who are battling for control of Hollywood Park, 
both took out full-page ads in Wednesday's Daily Racing Form. Everett's ad 
questioned Hubbard's sincerity in leaving Hollywood Park a public company. 
Hubbard's ad questioned Everett's sincerity in recently suggesting the sale of 
Hollywood Park. Hubbard said that in the past year Everett has twice rejected 
plans to change the structure of the track without presenting the options to 
her full board. He said that Marvin Davis, once a Hollywood Park board member, 
made overtures to buy the track, and that Santa Anita proposed a co- operative 
venture involving the two tracks. . . . Earlier this week, in an amendment to a 
lawsuit he had already filed, Hubbard challenged Hollywood Park's ability to 
delay its annual shareholders' meeting until February. According to state law 
in Delaware, where Hollywood Park is incorporated, the annual meeting must be 
held within 13 months after the end of the year, and February would be the 14th 
month after the end of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Peace, the horse that gave Bill Shoemaker his 1,000th stakes victory by winning 
the Premiere Handicap at Hollywood Park in 1989, died of an apparent heart 
attack Tuesday after a morning gallop at Santa Anita. The 5-year-old Charlie 
Whittingham trainee, who earned $361,950, hadn't run since finishing second in 
the Inglewood Handicap on June 17. . . . Only five horses are entered in 
Friday's San Miguel for 2-year-olds. Formal Dinner, who ran next to last in the 
Hollywood Futurity, will be joined by Roman Envoy, Apollo, Intimate Kid and 
Sondeed. . . . Santa Anita is dark today.

REACTION MIXED TO PLAYOFF CHANGES; 
</P>
<P>
NFL: NEW RULES HURT SOME DIVISION CHAMPIONS, BUT SPUR FAN INTEREST OF EXTRA 
WILD-CARD TEAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
The road to the Super Bowl this year is taking some new twists and turns. 
</P>
<P>
As the NFL's best clubs head into their final regular-season games this 
weekend, they are playing by several new rules: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Six wild-card teams, instead of four, will join the six division champions 
in the playoffs that start Jan. 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One division champion from each conference will have to beat a wild-card 
team that weekend to gain the second round Jan. 12-13. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only four division champions, the two with the best records in each 
conference, will get byes the first week. 
</P>
<P>
In previous years, all division winners were excused from first-round 
competition, earning, in effect, a two-week vacation. 
</P>
<P>
The difference this year is that in two of the six divisions -- one AFC, one 
NFC -- winning the championship will award not a champion's benefits but a 
wild-card handicap. 
</P>
<P>
After striving all year for the honor of finishing first, these two winners 
will discover that it's somewhat of an empty honor. 
</P>
<P>
Is that fair? Is it a good idea? 
</P>
<P>
There are two ways to look at it. 
</P>
<P>
First, the new plan should please most pro football fans. Instead of a 
comparatively quiet, one-day, two-game, wild-card weekend, there will be a more 
appealing two-day, four-game opening round. 
</P>
<P>
A total of eight, instead of four, teams in the first round of a monthlong 
single-elimination tournament could double the early excitement. 
</P>
<P>
But even so, the new format is seemingly unjust to the division winners, who 
are being treated like wild cards. It rewards the champions that happen to be 
in divisions that are relatively easy to dominate. 
</P>
<P>
"The players really didn't give the league a choice," said George Young, 
general manager of the New York Giants. "Where do you think the money's going 
to come from to pay all these guys?" 
</P>
<P>
More games, more television income. Or more precisely, the club owners will 
make more money by making their product available to more football fans -- who 
are glad to have it. 
</P>
<P>
"But I wish we didn't have to do it," said Ralph Wilson, owner of the Buffalo 
Bills. "It's too unfair to two teams." 
</P>
<P>
The example of a fan who approves comes from a baseball executive, Tom Grieve, 
general manager of the Texas Rangers, who said: "There's been a lot more Cowboy 
interest in Dallas this month with their chance to get one of the new wild 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
"With that kind of interest, how can it hurt the (NFL)?" 
</P>
<P>
Down the road, it can hurt in several ways, according to a veteran NFL club 
executive who asserted that if former Commissioner Pete Rozelle and former 
Dallas President Tex Schramm were still in charge, the league wouldn't have 
made this change. 
</P>
<P>
Requesting anonymity, he said: "The league has lost the importance of division 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, we have been telling the fans that winning the division is what the 
whole regular season is all about. Now we're telling them that a champion is no 
more important than a wild card." 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's emphasis, in other words, has shifted suddenly, if subtly, from 
winning division titles to making the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue holds that that isn't all bad. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that all 14 NFC teams were "still alive in the playoff chase" in the 
14th week of a 17-week season, Tagliabue said: "That's what the additional 
wild-card team does for competition. We anticipated added competition and 
excitement, and we have it. Division leaders can't relax now." 
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, leaders who relax, as they did too often in the 
controversial late-season games of other years, risk losing first-round byes. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tagliabue said, "The addition of two more wild-card teams reduces the 
possibility of excluding a runner-up team with a record superior to that of (a 
champion in another division)." 
</P>
<P>
That is more than a possibility. It has happened often in a league that since 
1978 has turned up 11 teams that failed to make the NFL playoffs after winning 
10 or more games. 
</P>
<P>
In those years, the NFL's leaders were charged with unfairness for a set of 
rules that admitted 9-7 or 8-8 teams to the playoffs -- simply because they had 
won the championship -- while eliminating 10-6 teams from other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Injustice is somewhat inherent in any playoff system. And that has been true 
since the first sports playoff series, baseball's first World Series in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
Although, since then, the best two ballclubs have more than once held 
membership in the same league -- in the view of baseball executives, players 
and writers -- the World Series matches teams from different leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Is the NFL's large new television contract too steep a price to pay for 
downgrading two division champions? 
</P>
<P>
It depends, no doubt, on whether you're getting a cut. The 28 clubs will each 
average $32 million annually from the TV companies in the first four years of 
the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
All three commercial networks will be involved in playoff telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
Said Giant General Manager Young: "We're in a profit-making business. We aren't 
stealing this money. We're giving our customers more, not less, entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
Will the division champions with the worst records gain anything substantial 
from their new status as wild cards? 
</P>
<P>
They may be comforted in two ways: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Each of their players will get $10,000 for playing in the first round. Thus 
if they should eventually win the Super Bowl, as a wild-card Raider team once 
did, they will make $10,000 more next month than any 49er stands to earn if San 
Francisco repeats. 
</P>
<P>
 -- More significantly, most football players have said for years that they 
dislike the two-week layoff before the Super Bowl, which, incidentally, has 
been done away with, at least this time around. This season, when the NFL 
instituted midseason one-week byes for all, they said it again. 
</P>
<P>
"You can have those . . . byes," observed Richard Dent of the Chicago Bears, a 
Pro Bowl player, echoing the sentiments of many other players. "I'd much rather 
get into the rhythm of playing every week." 
</P>
<P>
The rhythm of playing regularly: the coaches and players all prefer it. But it 
won't be everyone who has that privilege next month. Just the wild cards and 
two lowly division champions. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL's playoff schedule (times, teams and places to be announced): 
</P>
<P>
FIRST ROUND, JAN. 5-6 
</P>
<P>
In each conference: 
</P>
<P>
The division champion with the third-best regular-season record will be at home 
to the wild-card team with the third-best record. 
</P>
<P>
The wild-card team with the best record will be at home to the other wild card. 
(The former prohibition on intra-division games has been removed.) 
</P>
<P>
SECOND ROUND, JAN. 12-13 
</P>
<P>
In the divisional playoff games, champions with the two best regular-season 
records in each conference will be at home to first-round winners. 
</P>
<P>
The rules assure that the division champions with the best records will play 
the first-round winners who have the worst records. 
</P>
<P>
THIRD ROUND, JAN. 20 
</P>
<P>
In the conference championship games, the home team in each conference will be 
the surviving playoff winner with the best regular-season record. 
</P>
<P>
A wild card can't play host unless two wild cards have advanced. 
</P>
<P>
NFL policies provide that in the first three rounds, cold-weather games, if 
any, will be played first each day. A warmer-weather or dome matchup will be 
the second game each time. 
</P>
<P>

A U.S. review panel has delayed decision on shotputter Randy Barnes' appeal of 
a two-year doping suspension until it receives more information. 
</P>
<P>
Barnes, the world record-holder in the shotput, and fellow American Butch 
Reynolds, the 400-meter world record-holder, were suspended for two years by 
the International Amateur Athletic Federation on Nov. 5 after testing positive 
for steroids at European meetings in August. 
</P>
<P>
Both athletes have denied taking steroids and are appealing the suspensions 
through TAC, the sport's U.S. governing body.

The Cleveland Browns have placed running back Brent Fullwood on waivers, making 
him free to sign with any NFL team. The Browns traded a low pick in the 1991 
draft to Green Bay on Oct. 9 for Fullwood, who was the featured running back in 
the Packers' offense last season. The former Auburn star was with the Browns 
for 10 games and never had a carry.

NEBRASKA TO START GRANT AT QUARTERBACK

<TEXT>
<P>
Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne named Mike Grant as his starting quarterback for the 
Citrus Bowl game Tuesday in Orlando, Fla., against Georgia Tech. Osborne chose 
Grant over Tom Haase after Mickey Joseph suffered a severe leg laceration in 
the last game of the regular season against Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
Grant was Nebraska's starter in the season opener against Baylor but had a 
bruised knee that cost him the next two games. He returned as the starter in 
the fourth and fifth games but was then replaced by Joseph the rest of the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter who the quarterback is, you've still got to stop their 
offense," Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Ross said. "He's (Grant) a great football 
player and has a good arm. He's a better thrower than Joseph." JOHN CHERWA

MARINOVICH MAKES TRIP, ERVINS DOESN'T

Tailback Ricky Ervins, the most valuable player in USC's 17-10 victory over 
Michigan last Jan. 1 in the Rose Bowl, didn't even make the trip with the 
Trojans Wednesday as they flew to El Paso for Monday's John Hancock Bowl 
against Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
Ervins sprained his left ankle while gaining a season-high 199 yards against 
Ohio State three months ago at Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
He returned briefly six weeks later, gaining 13 yards in two carries against 
Oregon State, but reinjured his ankle and missed the Trojans' last two games. 
</P>
<P>
"His ankle just hasn't responded," Coach Larry Smith said. "He really couldn't 
do anything (in practice last week), so we met and I said, 'Do you want to go?' 
He said, 'Well, I can't play, so I'd rather not.' " 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that he didn't have "the slightest idea" who would start at 
quarterback against Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
"We could start any one of four guys," Smith said, alluding to Todd Marinovich, 
Shane Foley, Pat O'Hara and Reggie Perry. "I've opened it up completely. I've 
even entertained the idea of playing all four -- one a quarter. It's not very 
practical, but it's what I'd like to do." 
</P>
<P>
Marinovich missed a week of practice because of an ear infection, but returned 
for three days of pre-Christmas workouts. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were playing the game today, he wouldn't be the starter because he's 
missed so much work," Smith said. JERRY CROWE

FREEDOM BOWL NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
BOATRIGHT TAKES BUSINESSLIKE APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oregon's offense starts with Scot Boatright, without whom quarterback Bill 
Musgrave does not get the ball. And Boatright, the Ducks' senior center, says 
it is time to get down to business. 
</P>
<P>
Since business happens to be his major, and he's on track to graduate in four 
years with a 3.33 grade-point average, Oregon should listen up. 
</P>
<P>
Until Wednesday, game preparations for Saturday's Freedom Bowl game have been 
serious, but with a large measure of fun mixed in (i.e. Disneyland, Knott's 
Berry Farm and nights without curfews). 
</P>
<P>
"Until now, after we were done with practice and meetings, our time was free," 
said Boatright, who has spent most of his free time with his wife, Mani, and 
their 7 1/2-week-old daughter, Megan Anne. "When we came back from Christmas, 
we had to be in our rooms by midnight. Now we start curfews." 
</P>
<P>
As it should be, says Boatright, who played for the Ducks against Tulsa in last 
year's Independence Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon was playing its first bowl game since 1963 last year, and the Ducks 
might have been taken in by the hullabaloo. They trailed Tulsa, 24-10, late in 
the third quarter before scoring 17 points in the final 18 minutes and winning, 
27-24. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a pretty good halftime speech," Boatright said. "(Coach Rich Brooks) 
said we didn't come all that way to lose. We had to win that game to get any 
respect for this team." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks is trying to avoid having to make such a speech at halftime this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the players have had an enjoyable time," he said. "Now is the part 
where we get down to the business of trying to win the football game. 
</P>
<P>
"A bowl game is a different environment because of the long time between your 
last game, and the different environment. Our team has enjoyed itself. The fun 
is over." 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State finds itself in a position similar to the Ducks' last year. The 
Rams are playing their first bowl game in 42 years, and the players have been a 
little giddy over the whole experience. 
</P>
<P>
But Colorado State Coach Earle Bruce is coaching in his 13th bowl game and says 
he has developed a pretty good idea of how to prepare for them. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't, however, care to share his secrets. 
</P>
<P>
Is it going well? He's withholding judgment, and has expressed concern about 
preparation, including a few misgivings about the freedom he has given the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
Boatright nodded his approval. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I hear and see, Coach Bruce has taken the businesslike approach. 
That's very, very important." 
</P>
<P>
Oregon's Brooks was not pleased to see Arizona, another Pacific 10 school and a 
team that beat the Ducks by five points, shut out by Syracuse in the Aloha 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"To see them get handled, 28-0, put a little ache in my stomach," Brooks said. 
"You just have to be ready. You're not in your normal routine. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope we're more ready to play this year than we were last year. If not, 
we'll be in deep trouble." 
</P>
<P>
You bet: The university presidents of Oregon and Colorado State have agreed to 
a charitable wager on the outcome of the Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon's Myles Brand is putting up 25 pounds of fresh Pacific salmon against 25 
pounds of Colorado strip steak from Colorado State's Albert Yates. 
</P>
<P>
Brand has pledged to pass on any winnings to the Lane County Food Bank in 
Eugene, Ore., and Yates promises to donate his to the Larimer County Food 
Distribution Center in Ft. Collins, Colo.

HE PLAYS OFFENSE WITH DEFENSIVE FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
USC: PAT HARLOW BECAME A STANDOUT AS SOON AS HE MADE THE SWITCH TO THE 
OFFENSIVE LINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the end of his sophomore season two years ago, Pat Harlow was USC's 
fourth-best defensive lineman. Since the Trojans favor a 3-4 defensive 
alignment, that meant only one thing: 
</P>
<P>
He was the odd man out. 
</P>
<P>
What to do? 
</P>
<P>
Tired of sitting, Harlow thought about transferring. 
</P>
<P>
He thought about red-shirting. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he asked for a meeting with Coach Larry Smith, who suggested another 
option: Start over and move to offensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
Harlow agreed without hesitation and a star was born. 
</P>
<P>
In only his second season at his new position, the 6-foot-7, 270-pound Harlow 
was named to the all-Pacific 10 Conference first team last month. And in a vote 
of the conference's defensive linemen, he was named winner of the Morris Trophy 
as the Pac-10's outstanding offensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
NFL draft analysts have said that Harlow could be among the top 10 picks in 
next spring's selection process. He and Antone Davis of Tennessee are generally 
considered to be college football's best offensive tackles. 
</P>
<P>
What pro scouts and USC's coaches seem to like most about Harlow is his 
aggressiveness, a trait that can be traced to his time spent on defense and a 
characteristic said to be in short supply among offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
"I've noticed his real desire to make the block downfield -- to finish what 
he's doing, then make another block," said Jerry Frei, a scout for the Denver 
Broncos. "You look for an offensive player with that defensive attitude, that 
kind of half-mean (demeanor)." 
</P>
<P>
Harlow, who will play his final game for the Trojans Monday against Michigan 
State in the John Hancock Bowl, said he hasn't made any adjustments in his 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think there's a defensive mentality or an offensive mentality," 
he said. "It's a football mentality. Everybody says offensive linemen have to 
be passive. I think that's (baloney). Offense is to attack. Everybody thinks 
defensive players are crazy, and they are, but you have to be the same way on 
offense." 
</P>
<P>
Harlow was a two-way player at Norco High, where he was the Ivy League's 
defensive player of the year, an All-Riverside County pick on both offense and 
defense and highly regarded as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
But until the spring of his junior year at Norco, Harlow was partial to 
basketball, which he called "my love." His girlfriend, Jennifer Mersereau, 
another Norco alum, has described him as a gym rat. 
</P>
<P>
Contacted or actively recruited by several schools to play basketball, 
including Oregon, Arizona State and San Diego, Harlow almost quit football 
before a friend convinced him that his future was brighter outside the gym. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't jump really well," Harlow said. "I could dunk and all that, but I 
didn't have any serious hang time. I'm a pretty good athlete, but I couldn't 
see myself hanging out with Michael Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
He took to weightlifting and in the four months before his senior year, Harlow 
increased his weight from 195 to 240 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Recruited as a defensive lineman, he made trips to Washington and Colorado 
before deciding on USC, in part because his high school coach, Gary Campbell, 
told him that he probably would end up being an offensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to try defense, but the worst that could happen was that I would 
become a USC offensive lineman," Harlow said. 
</P>
<P>
USC has a tradition of producing top-notch blockers. Twenty of the Trojans' 
offensive linemen have been first-team All-Americans since 1964 and 16 have 
been first-round NFL draft picks since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when I was a kid, watching football on TV, I knew about USC's offensive 
line," Harlow said. 
</P>
<P>
He started only one game as a defensive lineman, and grew frustrated and 
depressed as a backup to All-American tackle Tim Ryan, who was only a year 
older. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches, too, saw that something needed to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't see wasting another year of that kind of talent on the second-team 
defense," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
So, Harlow was moved. 
</P>
<P>
Smith told him that he would be dominant by the time he was a senior, but after 
helping the Trojans win the Pac-10 championship last season, Harlow missed the 
Rose Bowl game because of a herniated disk in his back. 
</P>
<P>
After missing spring practice while recuperating from surgery, he returned a 
more passive player this season, although he didn't fully realize it until he 
met with Smith after a 31-0 loss at Washington in September. 
</P>
<P>
"I played terribly and the coaches just ripped me, which I deserved," said 
Harlow, who wasn't the only Trojan who faltered that day. "I don't think I 
could have played any worse. Coach Smith told me, 'You're not even a shell of 
the player you were last year. You're not pulling the trigger.' " 
</P>
<P>
Given a poor grade by his coaches, a chastened Harlow posted it on his bedpost 
and wrote over it, "Never again." 
</P>
<P>
And when he started pulling the trigger, opponents lay scattered. 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting in people's pads and putting them on their backs," Harlow said 
of his play in the last two months of the season. "A lot of it's technique. I 
started coming off the ball lower and running my feet through people, just kind 
of being relentless in finishing off my blocks." 
</P>
<P>
Against Oregon State and UCLA last month, he was given credit by the coaching 
staff for 20 knockdowns in each game. 
</P>
<P>
Harlow's only regret is not making the move from defense sooner, but he never 
doubted himself. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I thought, 'There's someplace I can play and be pretty good.' I didn't 
know where, but I thought I could find a place." 
</P>
<P>
Once he found out, recognition followed. And so did pro scouts.

BOOSTING THE GOAL PATROLS;

<P>
SOCKERS: OPPONENTS FIRING BLANKS -- AND SOMETIMES NOT FIRING AT ALL -- DURING 
RECENT STREAK.

<P>
The Sockers have always been good for an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Not anymore. They've become stingy, and in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
After allowing 63 goals and compiling a 3-7 record in their first 10 games, the 
Sockers have allowed 49 goals and have gone 7-3 in the past 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Take away Friday's 11-6 loss to Cleveland, and opponents have been scoring an 
average of 4.11 goals per game since the Sockers turned things around. This in 
a league with games that average more than 11 goals per game. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sockers also have become adept at deflecting questions about their 
stepped up patrols in front of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 What's happening back there? 
</P>
<P>
Sockers players would have you believe fate has something to do with their 
recent success. 
</P>
<P>
It's sort of like that bumper sticker. 
</P>
<P>
Defense happens. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? If Dan Quayle can happen, surely a group of unknown soccer 
players, even two who never played indoor, can bumble along and -- oops! -- one 
day preside in front of Major Soccer League goal boxes. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers have won four in a row at home and seven of 10. Much of the credit 
is going to the guys who started the season as built-in excuses as to why the 
team wouldn't gain a ninth indoor title. 
</P>
<P>
The would-be defensive scapegoats include: David Banks, a rookie who had never 
before played the game; Alex Golovnia, a Soviet import who also had never 
before played indoors; Glen Carbonara, a castoff from the Baltimore Blast; Ben 
Collins, previously a midfielder who spent most of last year on injured 
reserve; and Jim Gabarra, who before this year spent his career largely 
unnoticed in the midfield. 
</P>
<P>
It looked as if Coach Ron Newman was going to pull a Paul Westhead this season 
and just forgo defense. 
</P>
<P>
But as it turned out, these guys look nothing like the Denver Nuggets. Quite 
the opposite, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
In the team's last two home games, the defense put opponents in the record 
books near the top of the all-time list for fewest shots in a half. 
</P>
<P>
First, Cleveland managed only three shots in the first half of an eventual 10-3 
Sockers victory. Two days later, Dallas under-did Cleveland. It aimed only two 
shots on goal during the opening half and eventually fell, 5-4, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
There's more: Dallas took only five shots in the second half to finish with 
seven after four quarters -- the fewest attempted by an MSL team in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
The kicker: The Sidekicks could not get off a shot during a power-play in 
overtime. Two minutes later, they lost. 
</P>
<P>
And remember, the Sockers are a team minus three defensive standouts off last 
year's squad. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are George Fernandez, who led the team with 98 blocked shots a year ago; 
Ralph Black; who finished No. 3 on the team with 57 blocks; and Cacho, whose 41 
blocks were fourth-highest. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was asking, 'How can you let George Fernandez go? How can you let 
Ralph Black go? How can you not sign Cacho,' " remembered Erich Geyer, 
assistant coach. "Well, what's George Fernandez doing now?" 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez, who signed as a free-agent with the Cleveland Crunch, is nowhere 
near the pace at which he blocked 98 shots last year. After 19 games, Fernandez 
has 24 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
No one has filled the void created by Fernandez's departure in the Sockers 
blocked-shots column. After Kevin Crow's 38, the next highest total is 11. 
</P>
<P>
So the initial inclination is to credit goalie Victor Nogueira for the team's 
success. Since the Sockers have no proven back-up, Nogueira is the only goalie 
in the league to have started all of his team's games (20). Yet, he is second 
in the MSL in goals-against average at 5.14 (5.03 before the Cleveland 
debacle). 
</P>
<P>
There is an irony there considering a goalie's GAA tends to rise as does his 
minutes played. 
</P>
<P>
But Nogueira appears to be growing stronger, not weary, without a platoon 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been very pleased, No. 1 with his performance, and, No. 2 with his 
consistency," Coach Ron Newman said. "He doesn't seem to be suffering from 
playing too many games." 
</P>
<P>
Nogueira, in fact, thinks that all the starts are actually a benefit at this 
point in the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I play better when I get a lot of playing time," he said. "It allows me to get 
into a rhythm. But I would be stronger at the end of the year if we did 
rotate." 
</P>
<P>
His goals-against average seems to be proof that Nogueira has found a 
comfortable niche. It's down from 5.83 10 games ago. 
</P>
<P>
Nogueira, however, deflects credit to his defenders. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not doing that bad," Nogueira conceded, "but our defense is doing very 
well." 
</P>
<P>
It's doing well, Nogueira said, because, "everyone's doing what Kevin (Crow) is 
doing. He stands in front of the forwards instead of behind them." 
</P>
<P>
It's the nature of the game, Crow said. Indoor soccer simply allows for a 
defender to go for the interception. In outdoor soccer, on the other hand, 
defenders must guard against getting beat. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even know Kevin did that until I saw him demonstrating," Nogueira 
added. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration came, fittingly enough, 10 games ago when the Sockers began 
their march to .500. 
</P>
<P>
Bring this to Crow's attention, and he makes like Nogueira and passes the buck. 
"Most of the credit has to go to the front players," he said. "The forwards and 
midfielders are pressuring so well that the other teams aren't even getting the 
ball up field." 
</P>
<P>
Newman agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just the defenders," the coach said. "It's the whole team working as 
a unit when the team's on defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't start looking like a championship team until everybody starts coming 
back on defense. It takes a whole team to stifle any production (an opponent) 
can put together." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Newman acknowledges there is another explanation, and that is the 
progress of both the new players -- Banks and Golovnia -- and that of the 
former midfielders -- Collins and Gabarra. 
</P>
<P>
Banks has emerged as one of the league's most physical players; Golovnia, who 
in his 10 years of outdoor soccer in the Soviet first and second divisions 
never crossed the midfield stripe, has become comfortable enough to go forward 
and get involved with the offense; Gabarra and Collins have become total field 
players and are among team leaders in points and blocks. 
</P>
<P>
What's odd about all this is that each player seemed to hit his stride 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
That, Newman and Geyer say, is a product of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"Enormous amounts of confidence," Newman said. "I'm a great believer in 
confidence. A team that plays with confidence is much better than one that 
doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
Geyer has a theory about Sockers' winning attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has to do with where we play," he said. "The whole set-up of 
Southern California is a little cocky. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people say we're arrogant, but I don't think so. We're confident, and our 
players really work hard for their success. But on the other side of the coin, 
they have fun at the same time."

AGGIES WON'T BE RUN RAGGED

<P>
Texas A&amp;M's secret ingredient for Brigham Young in Saturday's Holiday Bowl 
was revealed Wednesday: Extra conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
Junior cornerback Kevin Smith, Texas A&amp;M's career interception leader and 
currently tied for first on the Southwest Conference's all-time list with 18, 
said at a Sea World news conference that the Aggies have been working harder 
than usual in practice for the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Aggies decided they needed to after facing Houston's run-and-shoot 
offense Oct. 13. The Aggies lost to Houston, 36-31, and although BYU doesn't 
use the run-and-shoot, Smith said the run-and-shoot is similar enough to help 
in preparation. 
</P>
<P>
"It does as far as knowing how to prepare us for conditioning," Smith said. 
"After Houston, we were really tired. Personally, I needed more conditioning, 
and the coaches knew (the team) did, too. . . . We've been running wind 
sprints, things like that." 
</P>
<P>
Add Smith: In becoming Texas A&amp;M's career interception leader, he passed a 
fellow by the name of Lester Hayes, who held the old record of 14 and went on 
to play for the Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny, a guy told me when I first got here that I will hardly get any 
interceptions in (man-to-man) coverage," Smith said. "I've been fortunate. I've 
had guys force the quarterbacks into throwing bad passes. Lately, I have to 
credit playing the safety position against run-and-shoot teams. When I'm at the 
corner spot, teams throw away from me." 
</P>
<P>
By Ty: Not unexpectedly, BYU quarterback Ty Detmer drew the largest crowds at 
the news conference Wednesday afternoon. A few excerpted comments: 
</P>
<P>
On last year's 50-39 Holiday Bowl loss to Penn State: "You never expect it's 
going to be like that. Those things just kind of happen. . . . Seems like 
things turn out weird here every year." 
</P>
<P>
On playing a school from his native Texas: "It's exciting for me to get to play 
a Texas school. I'd like to have a good performance so I can go home and not 
hear about it all holidays long." 
</P>
<P>
On seriously considering attending a Texas school instead of BYU: "I never did. 
I knew I had to get out of Texas to be successful throwing the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Family Ties: Senior Brian Mitchell, a first-team all-Western Athletic 
Conference defensive back, is one of 10 BYU players from Texas. He graduated 
from high school in 1987, the same year that Texas A&amp;M star running back 
Darren Lewis graduated from Carter High in Dallas. Mitchell said that, although 
he never played against Lewis in high school, he kept track of Lewis' progress. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the No. 1 back coming out, and you try to keep up with the guys 
graduating with you," Mitchell said. "And I keep up with A&amp;M -- they were 
my favorite team growing up." 
</P>
<P>
But Mitchell said he wasn't recruited by the Aggies. 
</P>
<P>
"Seems like I got something to prove," he said. "Half my friends in high school 
went to A&amp;M." 
</P>
<P>
Two current Aggies were teammates of Mitchell's in Waco: linebacker Anthony 
Williams and cornerback Eric Moore. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman defensive lineman Kefa Chatham also went to the same high school, but 
he was a few years behind Mitchell.

MCCLANCY RIPS TORREY PINES

Monsignor McClancy High School's basketball team passed on Shamu, then it blew 
past Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
The East Elmhurst, N.Y., school had Sea World scheduled on its morning 
itinerary Wednesday after arriving at 10 the previous night, but Coach Don Kent 
decided to cancel Shamu and his ocean friends. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Crusaders canceled Torrey Pines, 75-56, in the first round of the 
Above the Rim Hoopwear Prep Classic in front of a standing room-only crowd at 
Torrey Pines. 
</P>
<P>
"We were concerned because we were playing a host team in front of a big crowd 
and we knew they would overachieve," Kent said. "We were very concerned when 
they cut the lead to 10." 
</P>
<P>
That was with 3:26 left in the third quarter, when Torrey Pines reeled off nine 
consecutive points and wiped out a 40-22 halftime deficit to make it 48-38. 
</P>
<P>
But after a three-point play by Michael Chaplin and a 15-footer by Rich 
Hemphill made it 53-39 entering the fourth quarter, the Falcons (8-2) never got 
closer than 14. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we played well in the second half," said John Farrell, Torrey Pines 
coach. "I never did feel we were in continuity in the first half. I was 
disappointed in our defense; we have to be able to pressure people." 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines, hurt by recent injuries, brought up four sophomores and a 
freshman to the varsity. The freshman, Eddie Montalvo, started at guard. He had 
five points and three assists. 
</P>
<P>
McClancy's Michael Chaplin, who's committed to attend Texas, scored a game-high 
23 points. Rich Hemphill scored 16, Dylan Ervin 12 and Anthony Iapoce 10. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines got 11 points apiece from Dan Reynaga and John Allred, who fouled 
out with 4:24 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines plays at 2:45 p.m. today against Valhalla. McClancy plays at 4:30 
today against Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
St. Anthony 87, Camden 65 -- Jersey City, N.J., and Camden are two hours away 
by car, but the schools went 3,000 miles to meet on the basketball floor. St. 
Anthony, ranked No. 3 in the nation, traveled that far to face No. 18 Camden, a 
team it might very well play in the New Jersey state playoffs. The teams split 
their previous two games, in 1979 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Danny Hurley would like the national powers to play more often. 
</P>
<P>
"They're two great schools with two great reputations, two great coaches, great 
talent, it's beneficial to everyone," Hurley said. "It creates a lot of 
excitement." 
</P>
<P>
It certainly did. 
</P>
<P>
The Friars (4-1) outscored Camden 26-9 in the final five minutes to break open 
a 61-56 ballgame. Camden (3-1), ranked 18th nationally, trailed by 14 in the 
final seconds of the third quarter before a 15-5 run. 
</P>
<P>
St. Anthony's Rodrick Rhodes, who is trying to decide between attending 
Arizona, Seton Hall and Ohio State, scored 21 points and had eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln 91, Valhalla 85 -- Lincoln outscored Valhalla 33-16 in the final 
quarter to advance to today's second round. Lincoln (6-5) shot 62% from the 
field in the second half and got a game-high 27 points and team-high 11 
rebounds from junior Berry Randle. Hosa Baker scored 19 and Archie Robinson 17 
for the Hornets, who also got 12 points from John Akridge. 
</P>
<P>
Valhalla (8-2) led 47-38 at halftime but shot 45% in the second half. Cole 
Deneen scored 25 and Mark Dillon 21 to lead the Norsemen. 
</P>
<P>
Miami Senior 95, Las Vegas Bonanza 75 -- Miami Senior (9-1), ranked No. 9 in 
the nation, took a 50-35 halftime lead and held off Bonanza (8-3). Steve 
Edwards led all scorers with 29 points, and Tony Sanders had 19 for Miami. Ben 
Hanks scored 10. 
</P>
<P>
Bonanza got 27 points from Eric Long and 26 from Jamal Willis but had no one 
else score in double figures. Willis had 14 rebounds.

POISON'S POTENT PILL FOR HARD-ROCK FAME; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: THE BAND HAS SOLD MORE THAN 10 MILLION RECORDS BY APPEALING TO TEEN 
FANTASIES. IT PLANS TO AGE GRACEFULLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bret Michaels, singer of the massively popular hard-rock band Poison, glanced 
at his watch and took on a look of disbelief beneath his long blond hair. It 
wasn't from wondering where the hours went, but the years. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I swear to God, I'm doing interviews and they ask me how old I am 
and I say, 'I'm 18 now,' like I'm really thinking I'm just becoming 18," he 
said, sitting in his manager's Beverly Hills office. "It's really weird." 
</P>
<P>
Michaels is actually 27, but forgive him this slip back into adolescence: 
Acting out a teen fantasy -- for a largely teen audience -- has made him rich 
and famous. 
</P>
<P>
In the five years since Poison emerged from the Hollywood hard-rock scene, it's 
been the pop alternative to the darker Guns N' Roses. Poison's three albums 
have sold a total of more than 10 million copies in the United States (the 
current "Flesh &amp; Blood" is in the Top 20 and has sold about 2.5 million). 
The formula for success has involved a neo-glam approach of heavy facial 
makeup, flashy stage shows and a mix of party-time anthems and broken-love 
power ballads a la "I Want Action" and the 1988 No. 1 single "Every Rose Has a 
Thorn." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Poison's sold-out show New Year's Eve at the Long Beach Arena is not 
just a triumphant homecoming a year and a half after its last Southern 
California concert, but also the culmination of a tour in which Poison is 
routinely selling out arenas while most other hard-rock tours are struggling. 
(Poison also plays at the San Diego Sports Arena on Sunday.) 
</P>
<P>
But prone as he may be to reliving his past, Michaels is growing keenly aware 
of his future. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden I become 30 and think, 'How do I appeal to a girl that's 17? 
What do I know that she knows?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
In other words: Can teen-rock mature? 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask me this when I'm 45 and I'm still trying to sing 'Talk Dirty to Me' 
and be sexy in front of a bunch of 17-year-old girls, I think you can call me a 
little foolish," he said. "But I think the Stones have aged gracefully. And 
Aerosmith has aged gracefully. I love what they do." 
</P>
<P>
Already adjustments have been made for age and maturity. Most importantly, two 
band members addressed drug problems and entered rehab programs in the middle 
of the group's last tour, without the self-satisfied publicity that often 
accompanies such moves. 
</P>
<P>
The most noticeable change on a more cosmetic level is that the makeup has been 
toned down in favor of a mild tattooed-biker image. 
</P>
<P>
"I still enjoy wearing it," Michaels said of the cosmetics the band used to be 
known for. "But for the most part it's not as shocking as it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
And the band's range of music and lyrical themes has grown a bit with time. 
</P>
<P>
"The old songs were adolescent songs, I admit, and I still write 
semi-adolescent," he said. "But as I get older I'm finding ways to write how 
I'm feeling." 
</P>
<P>
But Michaels knows that how he's feeling now is a step or two removed from how 
he felt when he and guitarist C.C. DeVille, bassist Bobby Dall and drummer 
Rikki Rockett headed from Pennsylvania to Hollywood in 1983, determined to make 
it on the Sunset Strip. 
</P>
<P>
"Back then all I knew was I wanted my dad to hate us and I wanted my mom to 
hate us," Michaels said. "That's what I lived for. Back in Pennsylvania there 
was nothing I loved more than flipping a guy off while driving down the street 
with me and a bunch of my buddies in my car." 
</P>
<P>
Asked where the anger came from, Michaels continued, "You don't understand -- 
in Pennsylvania, any state in that area, there was no rock scene back then. If 
you went to school in a Scorpions T-shirt you had to wear it inside out. You 
got made fun of." 
</P>
<P>
That, he believes, is what helped boost both Poison and Guns N' Roses, made up 
largely of Midwesterners, above the countless other rockers trying to make it 
on the Strip in the mid '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"Out here it's a freer culture," he said. "But I'll tell you, maybe if I'd 
grown up out here I might be less angry. I like the fact that I'm a bit angry. 
I like the fact that some things turn me wrong. It gives me good motivation to 
write stuff."

THE CURRENTS OF CHANGE;

<P>
IN STORMY TIMES, THE ARTS PROVIDE ESCAPE -- AND A SOUNDING BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The dark clouds of recession and war overhang the arts this holiday season, as 
they overshadow everything else in our society. More than ever, the arts in 
1991 are likely to be divided in their response to events -- toward providing 
escapism from the grim pressures of the day and, on the other hand, toward a 
thoughtful and sometimes angry engagement with those pressures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Movies 
</P>
<P>
The great suspense story in Hollywood is what effect, if any, foreign ownership 
of four major studios will have. Matsushita will be taking over Universal; 
Giancarlo Parretti (who has already bought an Italian restaurant here in Los 
Angeles to be sure of proper nourishment) is at last in firm charge of 
MGM-Pathe; and Sony at Columbia and Rupert Murdoch at Fox are already well 
settled in. 
</P>
<P>
Matsushita has insisted it has no wish to rock an already profitable boat, and 
there are no signs that the product mixture differs from before at Columbia or 
Fox. Nevertheless, there is anxiety in the creative community over film 
projects that might not get made because they are insufficiently international 
in appeal, generally meaning they may be too domestic in theme or heavier on 
talk than wordless action. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Japanese takeovers mean infusions of capital and a 
potential increase in production levels -- good news for Hollywood. The 
possible downside of the new money is that it may temporarily disguise the fact 
that production costs are higher than ever and growing. The average negative 
cost of a studio film has gone beyond $20 million, and the costs of a 
blockbuster are double that or more. (Negative costs of "The Godfather Part 
III" are reported at $55 million, which suggests it will have to gross nearer 
to $200 million to recover its production and distribution costs.) 
</P>
<P>
The blockbuster mentality appears likely to continue to dominate thinking at 
the major studios. To the independents and the mini-studios will fall the 
opportunity as well as the necessity to make the low-budget and off-trail films 
that are often among the year's most interesting (like last year's "My Left 
Foot"). 
</P>
<P>
For the independents, the problem, apt to grow more severe if there is a rise 
in major studio output, is to find cinemas to play their products. Despite the 
rise in multiplex cinemas with their many choices, a significant number of key 
screens are again owned or dominated by the majors, as they were before the 
antitrust action of the early '50s. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood keeps on being full of surprises, finding new faces and new creative 
talents. The industry that gave us "Die Hard 2" also gave us "Awakenings." 
"Terminator II" is in the works, and big-budget escapist fare will, as usual, 
dominate Hollywood's output. But there will, also as usual, be a few surprises. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Television 
</P>
<P>
The home screen is likely to move in both directions at once. It will as always 
be the prime relief, the escape from the deepening crisis in the economy and 
the world. But if Vietnam became what New Yorker critic Michael Arlen called 
"the living room war," the conflict in the Middle East could, given the 
technological advances of the last two decades, become an even more close-in 
experience for home viewers. The satellite could give a new war -- presuming 
diplomacy cannot forestall it -- an awesome immediacy. 
</P>
<P>
The competition for viewers' attention among the three major networks, Fox 
Broadcasting, the independents and the cable channels is certain to intensify. 
Cable News Network and C-SPAN have already been eating into the networks' news 
audiences. With the percentage of cable-equipped homes growing daily, the loss 
of network viewers to arts and sports channels as well as news will continue. 
</P>
<P>
Within the cable industry, there may well be some consolidation of channels as 
the competition heats up for ad dollars (likely to be fewer if the recession 
deepens) and for viewers willing to pay for additional non-basic channels. What 
is clear is that the kind of alternative television once promised only by 
public TV is now a reality, here to stay in an almost dizzying array of 
options. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Theater 
</P>
<P>
The theater, which has been "the fabulous invalid" as long as anyone can 
remember but keeps on outliving us all, unquestionably faces rough going in 
1991. As fears of a recession are abroad in the society, expensive theater 
tickets must come to seem more and more a luxury. The adventurous and admirable 
Los Angeles Theatre Center, in financial difficulty from the moment of its 
birth, faces extremely hard going in the new year. 
</P>
<P>
The abbreviated run of a new production of "A Chorus Line" at the Las Palmas 
Theatre hinted of increased consumer resistance to an honored revival, just as 
the disappointing turnout for "My Children! My Africa!" in its Los Angeles run 
suggested that enthusiastic reviews of a new work are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, there was evidence of great vitality in the local theater scene, from the 
experimental readings at the Mark Taper's Itchey Foot wing to the South Coast 
Rep and the always excellent La Jolla Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
A. B. (Pete) Gurney's "Love Letters," its cast of two changing weekly, has 
proved a durable hit at the Beverly Canon Theatre, suggesting that the presence 
of stars in a bittersweet romantic vehicle offers protection from the economic 
weathers outside. 
</P>
<P>
The new year begins with a three-month reprise by Michael Crawford of the title 
role he created in "Phantom of the Opera," which will almost surely be once 
again the toughest ticket in town. 
</P>
<P>
Changes in artistic direction at the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera and at the 
Pasadena Playhouse (where Susan Dietz resigned after three very productive 
years, and her replacement is not yet named) will create their own kind of 
suspense. 
</P>
<P>
Local censorship, inspired by the furor at the National Endowment for the Arts 
and contemplated by timid city fathers under pressure from a handful of 
complainants, made trouble for some venues, including the Grove Shakespeare 
Festival in Garden Grove. But those troubles pale before the larger, de facto 
censorship of insufficient attendance and financial support. The empty seat is 
a wicked censor, and in 1991 could be the censor most to be feared. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Music 
</P>
<P>
Some traditional musical bastions face potential transformations over the next 
year through changes in leadership. The fresh winds blowing through the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic on the appointment of Esa-Pekka Salonen as permanent 
conductor have already received wide attention. And elsewhere Claudio Abbado 
takes over at the Berlin Philharmonic, Kurt Masur replaces Zubin Mehta at the 
New York Philharmonic, Wolfgang Sawallisch will become conductor at the 
Philadelphia Orchestra in succession to Riccardo Muti and Gerard Mortier has 
been appointed heir to the late Herbert von Karajan at the Salzburg Festival. 
</P>
<P>
As to what will be played and how, both contemporary and traditional music will 
continue to show notable new energy and marked listener support. The trend in 
the older repertoire is authenticity -- period instruments and as-written 
orchestra sizes for music up to and including Brahms and Bruckner. At the other 
end of the chronological scale, listener-friendly neo-romantics, 
post-Minimalists and fusion eclectics will vie for attention. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of recession-pinched fall-offs in donations as well as paying 
customers is a worry for all music enterprises, from chamber to dance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pop Music 
</P>
<P>
The recession may well dent attendance at expensive concerts. On the other 
hand, there is apt to be an increased trend toward home entertainment, which 
bodes well for sales of CDs, cassettes, the vanishing LP and for viewership of 
the razzle-dazzle of MTV. 
</P>
<P>
Economics aside, the pop music world seems to be heading in two somewhat 
contradictory directions. There is a good deal of what can be called 
cross-culturalization going on, as in rap music's full entry into the 
mainstream pop world via such performers as Vanilla Ice and M. C. Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
At a more senior level there are the pan-global musical explorations of Paul 
Simon, Peter Gabriel and David Byrne. Both trends are relatively tame, but they 
do open the door for more ambitious listeners to seek out the angrier raps and 
the less homogenized ethnic music. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking the safe, tame and familiar is the motivation for another trend in pop 
music: The segregation of tastes. Moderately serious music fans once had 
eclectic tastes and were eager to listen to almost anything. Now radio stations 
stick tight to a formatted taste and style, and fans of one brand of music are 
unlikely to hear the hits in another style only a few dial numbers away. 
</P>
<P>
The segregation also includes a widening generation gap. Many of today's 
parents grew up with rock 'n' roll and have little trouble relating to their 
children's fondness for New Kids on the Block or comparably traditionalist rock 
sounds. Nevertheless the parents cling to the music of their own generation, 
convinced that nothing good has happened since the Supremes, the Animals, the 
Byrds or, surely, the Beatles. Thus the proliferation of radio stations 
specializing in "golden oldies" and the 1967 rock hit parade. 
</P>
<P>
Technology is also having a major effect on the pop scene (including the 
lip-sync scandal of Milli Vanilli). Sampling and synthesizers have removed the 
creation of pop music from the live performance stage or a new group's garage 
to the high-tech studio. Thus the marketing of the music has little to do with 
actual performance (which may be largely pantomime) and more with image. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jazz 
</P>
<P>
In current jazz, there is a remarkable sort of generation closure visible and 
audible, with a senior generation of players and an extraordinary infusion of 
young players best symbolized by the Marsalis brothers. Both sets are giving 
jazz a vitality and, perhaps even more significantly, a visibility and outreach 
it has lacked in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz, indeed, has seemed as much an invalid as the theater, and not necessarily 
a fabulous one, either. At times, it had appeared that more than Louis 
Armstrong died with him. Jazz was not much seen or heard on television, and 
jazz clubs were an imperiled species. 
</P>
<P>
The millennium is not yet at hand, but the condition of jazz, thanks not least 
to the excitement engendered by the new young players, is stronger than it has 
been in several years. Compact disc technology, though the discs are still 
relatively expensive, has evoked a flood of reissues of classic recordings, 
from all of Bix Beiderbecke to the complete Commodore label. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz parties and jazz cruises are becoming a major phenomenon. Some of the 
surviving senior jazzmen -- the likes of Flip Phillips, Bob Haggart and Milt 
Hinton among several others -- can tour almost continually here and abroad 
(where American jazz has always been more honored than at home). New jazz 
venues are opening in Los Angeles and elsewhere, and hanging on. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for jazz is not only the emergence of new players, like Howard 
Alden, a wizard guitarist only now in his 30s, but also of young audiences. For 
a time, pop-rock had a stranglehold on young listeners, leaving jazz to an 
audience that was growing old along with the performers. Jazz, over its wide 
range from traditional to Condonesque mainstream to fusion and beyond, is 
finding new consumers in a young generation, as it had to do to stay viable. 
The fusion of young and older, onstage and offstage, is likely to continue in 
the new year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Art 
</P>
<P>
The sizzle appears to have fizzled selectively on those skyrocketing prices for 
acknowledged masterpieces of art, which may have peaked with Van Gogh's 
"Irises." Several important late-year offerings failed to achieve their reserve 
prices and were withdrawn. But the market has not so much collapsed as grown 
more choosy. 
</P>
<P>
As to what the artists and the galleries are doing (and will go on doing), 
landscapes, portraits and abstractions continue to be made and shown in large 
numbers. But there is more importantly a continuing and significant increase in 
the political and social content of art (fueled rather than extinguished by the 
NEA flap about art standards and practices). 
</P>
<P>
Museumgoer tastes tend toward the traditional, and the Walter Annenberg 
Impressionism collection packed 'em in at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
More notable last year, however, and probably a precursor of things to come, 
were a flap in Little Tokyo about a Barbara Kruger mural on the Temporary 
Contemporary and the Santa Monica Museum of Art's show of works by David 
Wojnarowicz, whose outspoken essay led John Frohnmayer to withdraw an NEA grant 
(temporarily) from Artists Space in New York. Guerrilla poster artist Robbie 
Conal's show at the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena also raised 
conservative hackles. Conal's "Artificial Art Official" poster of Jesse Helms 
was one of the year's most potent. 
</P>
<P>
The controversies over the freedom and latitudes of artistic expression, which 
dominated the 1990 art news even beyond the high bids, are quite likely to 
resurface in 1991, in other settings but on the same lines. 
</P>
<P>
A related theme that may be heard even more loudly in 1991 is the issue of 
multicultural representation in art institutions. In Los Angeles in 1990 the 
major attempt to redress past imbalances was UCLA's Wight Art Gallery show 
"Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation." 
</P>
<P>
With multiculturalism comes an unresolved debate about quality. The 
traditionalists hold out for "standards," while the disenfranchised argue that 
"quality" is a code word that translates as an excuse for excluding minorities. 
Some conciliators are talking about "cultural equity" instead of "quality." 
</P>
<P>
As Los Angeles itself becomes ever more multiethnic, the controversy over 
ethnic representation in public institutions will very likely heat up anew in 
1991.

NOT ALL 'GODFATHER III' VIOLENCE IS ON THE SCREEN; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: A THEATER PATRON IS KILLED AS GANG WARFARE ERUPTS IN A LONG ISLAND 
MULTIPLEX. 
</P>

<P>
Four patrons watching "The Godfather Part III" in a Valley Stream, N.Y., 
theater, were shot Tuesday night, one fatally, by two groups of young men who 
argued over noise. 
</P>
<P>
Nassau County police described the groups as "heavily armed gangs" of from five 
to 10 each, one group sitting in the front row and the other near the back of 
the Sunrise Cinema Multiplex, located on Long Island near the New York City 
border. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the panicked audience of about 600 fled for their lives as the two 
gangs opened fire on each other, about 20 minutes into the R-rated movie set in 
the world of the Mafia. The groups apparently missed their adversaries, but hit 
four bystanders in the crossfire, including the 15-year-old who died. Another 
victim was shot in the left eye. Police said 12 to 25 shots were fired from 
three automatic weapons, two handguns and other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the exact nature of the argument," a police spokesman said. "The 
altercation escalated into almost a physical battle before the shooting began." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the theater has a history of violence, with eight serious incidents 
reported in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
In Hollywood, at Mann's Chinese Theater, a teen-age boy suffered a seizure 
during the 4:15 p.m. showing and the film had to be stopped while paramedics 
arrived. A theater spokesman said that the interruption caused subsequent movie 
times to be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
Business was reported brisk at many theaters. At the Cineplex Odeon Universal 
City, one patron, Duane Tudahl, said he and friends arrived at 2 p.m. and 
waited 45 minutes to buy a ticket. But the earliest available showing they 
could buy for was 7 p.m. DAVID J. FOX

THE FORCES BEHIND BEDOYA'S RESIGNATION; 
</P>
<P>
ART: FORMER DIRECTOR OF LACE CITES 'PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES' WITH THE BOARD 
OF DIRECTORS AND FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS FACING THE DOWNTOWN CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
"Philosophical differences and the lack of a good working relationship with the 
board" prompted Roberto Bedoya's resignation as director of Los Angeles 
Contemporary Exhibitions, he said this week. His stepping down on Dec. 19, just 
seven months after Bedoya took over the top staff position at the downtown 
venue, was also a result of the financial hardships facing the center and the 
art world at large, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My main problem with the board was (that) I was planting seeds for the future 
and they wanted something quicker," said Bedoya by phone from San Francisco. 
"The first seven months I was there were (spent) building bridges and trying to 
place LACE in a positive relationship with diverse communities, which are often 
in contradiction (with each other)." 
</P>
<P>
Board co-chairs Dale Stulz and Linda Nishio, who declined to comment, will 
serve as interim co-directors of the center while a national search for 
Bedoya's successor takes place. 
</P>
<P>
On the job at the alternative-performing and visual-arts space since June, 
Bedoya had been working at San Francisco's Intersection for the Arts and 
advising the California Arts Council on multicultural programming before 
joining LACE. He plans to continue with his career as a poet and playwright. 
</P>
<P>
That conflict, he said, was exacerbated by the shrinking of funds for the arts. 
"The organization is pressed financially. There are anxieties about the cash," 
he said, although he stressed that the situation was no more dire than that of 
other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
That anxiety left the board unwilling to let Bedoya work at his pace, in his 
own way: "How I approach being a leader, (includes) talking to many different 
people and that's a slow process. The board wanted to move more quickly." 
</P>
<P>
What Bedoya's resignation portends, however, may be a larger setback for the 
12-year-old venue. Before Bedoya's appointment, LACE had come under fire for 
giving too much attention to predominantly white contemporary arts and not 
enough to the work of minority artists. Bedoya was in the process of expanding 
LACE's profile "to include more diversity and communities ."

CORONER ISSUES CALL FOR HELP; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: THE UNDERSTAFFED DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING FOR VOLUNTEERS TO ASSIST IN A 
NUMBER OF TASKS, INCLUDING CLERICAL WORK AND GRIEF COUNSELING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chronically understaffed Los Angeles County coroner's office is seeking 
volunteers to help with everything from typing to transporting bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a mounting caseload, the office could use as many as 120 volunteers 
to assist with a variety of tasks, said Barbara Davidson, the new director of 
the department's volunteer program. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers are not new to the busy Los Angeles office, which last year 
investigated about 18,000 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had people come in the office and say they'd like to volunteer and we 
have signed them up," Davidson noted. "That's been ongoing." 
</P>
<P>
But she said this marks the first time the department has actively recruited 
volunteers to work throughout the office -- doing clerical work, counseling 
grieving families, transporting corpses, helping out in autopsy rooms, or 
assisting with computer programming. 
</P>
<P>
"We could use help," acknowledged coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher. "We're 
chronically understaffed, chronically overworked." 
</P>
<P>
Although the department was given money to hire additional personnel in its 
most recent budget, most of the new positions are for forensic pathologists and 
investigators, rather than the jobs the volunteers are being sought for. 
Moreover, many of the new openings have yet to be filled. 
</P>
<P>
The second-busiest coroner's office in the country after New York City, the 
department experienced a substantial increase in homicide cases this year. As 
of the end of November, the office had handled 15% more homicides than during 
the same period in 1989. The total number of deaths investigated was up 2.5% 
and the number of autopsies performed had risen by 6%. 
</P>
<P>
Dambacher said the volunteer program has been under discussion for some time 
and was officially launched last week, before publication of a Times article on 
the long delays in performing autopsies, which have plagued the office in 
recent years as a result of its huge workload. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Davidson said that with more help, cases could be processed more 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Unfazed that it will be her job to persuade people to do for nothing what many 
would refuse to do for pay, Davidson said she has already received calls from 
potential volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"I just talked to someone who wants to volunteer," Davidson said. "She 
graduated from mortuary school and never went for her license, and she wants to 
volunteer (doing clerical work)." 
</P>
<P>
Working in the coroner's office, Davidson said, will give "people the 
opportunity to do something very beneficial for their community." 
</P>
<P>
She noted that the coroner's office is simply joining the ranks of other county 
departments that have long had volunteer programs, ranging from library aides 
to reserve sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly going to try to make it as positive as possible," she said.

CANCER SURGERY FOR BLOCK;

<P>
SHERIFF: THE 66-YEAR-OLD'S PROSTATE AILMENT IS ANOTHER BLOW IN HIS DEPARTMENT'S 
DOWNBEAT YEAR. HE PLANS TO RETURN AFTER SIX WEEKS. 
</P>

<P>
Sheriff Sherman Block, whose department weathered a tumultuous year marred by a 
corruption scandal and brutality complaints, disclosed Wednesday that he has 
cancer of the prostate gland and will undergo surgery next month. 
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old Block, who was reelected last spring as head of the nation's 
largest sheriff's department, told a news conference that he expects to recover 
fully from a malady that doctors have diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, or a 
gland-related cancer in his prostate. 
</P>
<P>
"I am in exceptionally good health otherwise, and after a recuperation period 
of about six weeks, I expect to be fully recovered and back to full duty with 
the department," said Block. 
</P>
<P>
Prostate cancer affects about one in 11 U.S. men, according to health 
statistics. Block said his illness was first diagnosed about six weeks ago 
during a routine physical examination that spurred further tests. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the sheriff said he has been undergoing hormonal therapy in 
anticipation of surgery now scheduled for Jan. 7 at the Norris Cancer Hospital 
&amp; Research Institute in the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. During 
his recovery period, Block said, he will turn over day-to-day supervision of 
his department to Undersheriff Robert A. Edmonds. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can assure you that after the first few days of recovery, I will be 
requesting and receiving regular briefings as to what is occurring in the 
department operations," Block said. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise medical announcement was sent by Teletype to the department's 
12,000 employees at sheriff's stations and other department offices. Edmonds, 
52, the department's second-highest official, said that only a few family 
members and Block aides were aware of the sheriff's diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
"He's well-prepared to undergo the surgery," said Edmonds, who was summoned 
from vacation to attend the news conference. "He has a very good attitude about 
it and his overall health is very good." 
</P>
<P>
For the Sheriff's Department, Block's medical condition came as the latest blow 
in a downbeat year -- a year the sheriff himself described Wednesday as a 
"mixed bag of pluses and minuses." 
</P>
<P>
The most traumatic event was the money-skimming scandal, which arose from 
allegations that officers pocketed money seized during narcotics operations. 
The scandal forced Block to dismantle the department's vaunted narcotics teams, 
which had been responsible for some of the county's largest seizures of cocaine 
and illegally obtained cash. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of a federal and local corruption investigation, six sheriff's 
narcotics officers were convicted recently of conspiracy and theft. A seventh 
officer also was convicted on a related money-laundering charge. 
</P>
<P>
Two more trials are scheduled, and Block said the narcotics scandal may result 
in additional indictments against deputies. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, the sheriff acknowledged that the narcotics investigation 
revealed "a breakdown of supervision" in some cases. But he staunchly defended 
his administration in the scandal, blaming "a handful" of problem officers for 
the corruption. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Block also defended his agency against criticism on other issues 
that surfaced in 1990, including accusations that his officers engaged in 
excessive force and unwarranted shootings and that a clique of deputies at the 
Lynwood sheriff's station adopted street gang behavior to intimidate their 
supervisors and citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Block, who has already said he is investigating the Lynwood complaints, 
disputed many of the allegations and dismissed other complaints as 
unsubstantiated accusations that arise from lawsuits targeting law enforcement 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Although the number of deputy-involved shootings has increased -- from 37 in 
1989 to 46 through November of this year -- Block blamed the rise on an overall 
increase in street violence in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Homicides handled by his department have soared by 32% this year compared to 
1989, and felony assaults have jumped 18%, the sheriff said. In addition, six 
deputies have been wounded in street violence, compared to four last year, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men, after skin cancer. One 
out of every 11 men will develop it, most of them after age 65. About 30,000 
men die from the disease each year, making it the second leading cause of 
cancer deaths in men, after lung cancer. However, prostate cancer is often 
curable when caught early. Many cases are detected during rectal examinations, 
which are recommended annually for all men older than 40. The disease is 
treated surgically. Radiation, hormone treatment and chemotherapy may be 
prescribed as well. If the cancer has spread beyond the gland, cure is less 
certain. But patients whose tumors are still confined to the prostate have a 
five-year survival rate of 84%, according to the National Cancer Institute. 
About 60% of prostate cancers are diagnosed at this relatively early stage.

ARSONIST SOUGHT AS 3 FIRES ERUPT, DESTROYING 2 STUDIO CITY STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA and MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<TEXT>
<P>
An arsonist was sought in three fires that erupted within minutes of one 
another in stores along Ventura Boulevard in Studio City on Wednesday, gutting 
two and causing more than $2.5 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses reported seeing a man run from the scene, his face covered with soot. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Fire Department investigators said they also suspect that the 
blazes were intentionally set because of their almost simultaneous timing, the 
similarity of the businesses hit and the discovery of an empty gasoline can in 
the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
"One started right after the other -- bang, bang, bang," said Battalion Chief 
Robert MacMillan. "You don't have three fires like that all at one time." 
</P>
<P>
Arson investigators were seeking a man described as "a transient type," who 
witnesses said was acting suspiciously at the time the flames erupted. 
</P>
<P>
Fire spokesman Greg Acevedo described him as a white male, about 35 years old, 
5 feet, 9 inches tall, weighing 170 pounds, cleanshaven with slicked-back hair, 
wearing black pants, a dark purple shirt and a black coat. 
</P>
<P>
The first fire, which broke out about 11:30 a.m., was extinguished quickly by 
an internal sprinkler system. Firefighters preparing to return to the station 
just after noon saw the smoke cloud from the two major fires that broke out 
nearby and immediately summoned reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
Those fires, in a strip of contiguous buildings in the 12100 block of Ventura 
Boulevard, broke out within a minute of each other and destroyed Pier 1 Imports 
and Strouds Linen Warehouse, about half a block apart. Three other businesses 
were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people evacuated shops and the Mann's Studio City movie theater as 
thick smoke enveloped the block-long area. 
</P>
<P>
One firefighter was treated for minor facial burns, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Studio City Chamber of Commerce said the managers of three shops across 
from those that burned received threatening phone calls shortly after the 
blazes started, warning, "You're next." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they were unsure whether the calls were connected to the three 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
The first fire caused only minor damage to the Bed, Bath and Beyond store. The 
other two stores did not have sprinkler systems and were not legally required 
to have them, MacMillan said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire at Pier 1 broke out in a section where pillows were sold and the fire 
at Strouds started in a section where comforters were sold, witnesses said. The 
flames spread rapidly in the linen and wood merchandise, MacMillan said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters found a one-gallon gasoline container and a plastic bottle in the 
debris of Strouds, said Assistant Fire Chief Richard Olsen. Two security guards 
at the Thrifty store next to Strouds said they were taking a break in the 
parking lot behind the stores when they saw a disheveled, soot-covered man with 
slicked-back hair and dark clothing running toward them just after the fires 
started. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked like he had been burned," said security guard Kordell Knox. "He had 
soot on his face." 
</P>
<P>
Knox said he and his partner, Fernando Espinosa, asked the man if he had 
started the fire, and the man mumbled something and ran past them as flames 
leaped from the back of Pier 1. The guards noticed the second fire at Strouds 
and went back to Thrifty, next door to Strouds, where they persuaded their 
initially skeptical co-workers to evacuate, Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, two other Thrifty employees saw a man of similar 
description inside the store. The employees said the man smelled "like motor 
oil" and made a bizarre announcement: 
</P>
<P>
"There is a man out there looking at a mirror. And he is so ugly that he set 
the mirror on fire." 
</P>
<P>
The man left the store, said employee Bryan Miller, who said the same man had 
been loitering in the store earlier this week and had been asked to leave. 
</P>
<P>
There was extensive water, smoke and fire damage at the Valley Arts Guitar 
Center next to Pier 1, destroying several vintage guitars in a second-story 
repair shop, and water and smoke damage to Lamb Realty next to the guitar shop, 
Olsen said. 
</P>
<P>
Smoke, water and flames also damaged an AT&amp;T phone store next to Strouds. 
</P>
<P>
Damage from the fires was placed in excess of $2.5 million by fire officials. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers Leslie Berger, Greg Braxton and Steve Padilla contributed 
to this story.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PIZZA PARLOR CUSTOMER KILLED IN HOLD-UP 
ATTEMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A masked gunman killed a customer and wounded two other people during a 
Christmas night robbery attempt at an Echo Park pizza parlor, police said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman fled after the shooting without any money, said Police Sgt. Dan 
Dejarnette. 
</P>
<P>
The dead customer, whose name was being withheld, was handing over his money to 
the gunman when he was shot, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy actually took out his wallet and was giving him his money when the 
suspect shot him," Detective Ron Whitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Another customer and a restaurant employee also were shot when the gunman 
entered L.A. Loco Pizza shortly after 7:45 p.m., Dejarnette said. 
</P>
<P>
Both were treated at County USC-Medical Center and released.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MUDSLIDE KNOCKS OUT WALLS, CEILINGS IN 
HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A family escaped injury Wednesday morning when a mudslide swept down off a 
hillside and caved in part of their house in Brentwood Estates, knocking out 
walls and ceilings and covering the interior with oozing slime and debris. 
</P>
<P>
Marla Cohn said she was lying in bed about 9:30 a.m. when she and her two young 
children were startled by a deep rumbling noise that sounded like a major 
earthquake, but with tree branches snapping and other noises. 
</P>
<P>
"Then the hill behind us fell down and into our house, through the master 
bathroom and into the bedroom," Cohn said. "It totally leveled the back rooms," 
including her bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Saddam Hussein had bombed the country," said Cohn's son Mason, 8, 
who was in another room at the time. 
</P>
<P>
John Cohn, a relative of the Cohns, said the slide apparently was triggered by 
a buildup of leaking water from a broken pipe buried in the hill above the home 
off Bundy Drive. He said half the one-story house was "wiped out." 
</P>
<P>
The unattached garage of an adjacent home also was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said no one will know what caused the slide until geologic tests 
are completed and the city Department of Water and Power and Building and 
Safety officials investigate. 
</P>
<P>
"It might have been a water main, but it might have been sprinklers left on," 
said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo. "We've had that happen 
before." 
</P>
<P>
By evening, two bedrooms and two bathrooms in the Cohn home were piled to the 
ceiling with parts of the house's walls, roof and support beams. The family was 
forced to abandon the house temporarily for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Next door, Marone Cantwell and her husband spent the day and early evening 
shoveling out their two mud-caked cars. 
</P>
<P>
Although their house escaped damage, the back-yard pool was filled with mud and 
the garage was irreparably damaged, Cantwell said, adding, "The whole hill came 
down." JOSH MEYER

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COLD KILLS SOME FLOWERS BOUND FOR ROSE 
PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The pre-Christmas cold snap killed some flowers destined for the Tournament of 
Roses parade, but float builders said Wednesday that most parade-goers will not 
notice any difference in the bloom department. 
</P>
<P>
"It has us scurrying around, keeping us busy, but it's nothing serious," said 
Rick Chapman, owner of Festival Artists in Azusa, which is building 11 floats 
for the New Year's Day parade in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Between 5% and 10% of the flowers that were expected to be attached beginning 
Wednesday were destroyed by subfreezing weather since late last week, according 
to three of the largest float builders. 
</P>
<P>
Marigolds were the biggest loss, said Felicia Berry, floral consultant for 
Festival Artists, which plans to substitute carnations or yellow and gold 
chrysanthemums. About 1,450 bunches of marigolds and some heather were killed, 
she said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MARINE EXPERTS FEAR HARASSMENT OF WHALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As whale-watchers in Southern California begin coastal treks in search of 
migrating whales, environmentalists and marine experts say that they are 
concerned with mammal safety. 
</P>
<P>
"The harassment has definitely increased. 
</P>
<P>
We had cases last year where 30 boats were trailing right behind only two 
whales," said Ray Sautter of the National Marine Fisheries Service at Terminal 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
The whale-watching season began Wednesday and continues through April. Tour 
boat skippers take tens of thousands of people for a close-up look at the huge 
sea mammals. But the boats often navigate too close to the whale pods. Whales 
split up when chased, and a calf or cow will not survive if it is separated 
from the group, Sautter said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal guidelines direct boaters to stay at least 100 yards from a whale and 
to follow the speed of the slowest mammal in the pod.

PREPS: USC AND MIAMI MIGHT BE OUT OF RUNNING FOR WALSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of colleges Carson High quarterback John Walsh is considering 
appears to have shrunk from four to two in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, scratch Miami. The Hurricanes, who reportedly plan to sign only 
one quarterback, received an oral commitment last week from Alan Hall of 
Middleburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said Wednesday he might cancel his trip to Miami, scheduled for the 
weekend of Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
USC also seems an unlikely choice for Walsh. The Trojans have gotten oral 
commitments from two of the Southland's top prep quarterbacks -- Kyle Wachholtz 
of Norco High and Rob Johnson of El Toro. Johnson, the top-rated quarterback in 
Orange County, is the brother of Bret Johnson, the former UCLA quarterback who 
transferred to Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
USC reportedly also plans to sign Loyola quarterback Corby Smith, the son of 
Trojan Coach Larry Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said he isn't "scared off" by the non-binding commitments -- seniors 
cannot sign letters of intent until Feb. 6 -- but obviously the situation at 
USC is no longer attractive for an incoming quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves Brigham Young and Washington. Walsh said he will visit BYU on Jan. 
12 and Washington on Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterbacks seem to get bigger and bigger every year. 
</P>
<P>
Hall, the Miami recruit, is 6-foot-4 and 225 pounds. Wachholtz is 6-5 and 205, 
Johnson is 6-4 and 210, and Walsh is 6-4 and 215. 
</P>
<P>
In the preseason issue of Super Prep magazine, Hall was rated the third-best 
quarterback in the nation, Wachholtz was No. 6 and Johnson was No. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who wasn't a touted recruit until he began playing for Carson this 
season after transferring from West Torrance, wasn't even listed among the top 
players on the West Coast by Super Prep. 
</P>
<P>
However, after passing for a state-record 4,223 yards and 48 touchdowns, Walsh 
has been the recipient of several awards. Most notably he was honored with The 
Times' Glenn Davis Award as the top player in Southern California, and was 
selected L.A. City 4-A Division Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came to Carson, I didn't envision getting all these awards," he said. 
"Now that I'm getting them, I'm happy." 
</P>
<P>
The El Segundo boys' and Morningside girls' basketball teams traveled to the 
Central Coast area last week and came away with tournament championships. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo won the eight-team Santa Ynez Tournament and Morningside won the 
prestigious Santa Barbara Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
In a repeat of last season's State Division I final, Morningside defeated 
Berkeley, 71-60, in the tournament final Saturday night. Center Janet Davis, a 
6-4 junior, led the Lady Monarchs with 31 points and 15 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside also received a strong effort from 6-1 sophomore forward Tina 
Thompson, who scored 12 points in the final. 
</P>
<P>
"She's going to make us a very dangerous team as the season goes on," 
Morningside Coach Ron Randle said of Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo extended its winning streak to four games Saturday by beating 
Mission Prep of San Luis Obispo, 76-67, in the title game of the Santa Ynez 
Tournament. Senior forwards Travis Showalter and Chris Hansen led the Eagles 
with 27 and 25 points, respectively. Hansen was named MVP and Showalter was 
chosen to the all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Rick Sabosky said El Segundo was hoping for a rematch with Laguna Beach 
in the final, but the Artists lost to Mission Prep in the semifinals. Laguna 
Beach beat El Segundo in last year's Southern Section 2-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament championship is an encouraging sign for El Segundo, which 
graduated the top six players from last season's team. But after starting 1-3, 
the Eagles have won eight of 10 games to improve to 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
"For having all new guys, I think we can play with people," Sabosky said. "But 
we have to be really smart." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-4 Hansen has developed into quite a sharpshooter for El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
He leads the team in scoring, averaging 23 points a game, and has made 58 
three-point shots in 14 games. He scored 41 points and made eight three-point 
shots Dec. 10 in a 63-57 victory over North Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Hansen's outside shooting and the inside scoring of the 6-4 Showalter has 
proved to be a winning combination. Showalter is averaging 18 points and nine 
rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles have also benefited from the return of 6-4, 240-pound center Tom 
Frechette, who missed the first 10 games with a knee injury suffered during 
football season. 
</P>
<P>
"When Hansen and Showalter are playing as a team, and not caring who is 
scoring, we're pretty good," Sabosky said. "When one guy says, 'I'm going to 
win it for us,' then we're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Right-handed pitcher Armando Cervantes, who missed most of last baseball season 
with a shoulder injury after earning All-Angelus League honors for Bishop 
Montgomery as a sophomore, has transferred to Narbonne. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 195-pound senior was one of the area's best pitchers two years ago, 
when he went 7-1 and was named Bishop Montgomery's team MVP. 
</P>
<P>
"We're bringing him along slowly," Narbonne Coach Nick Van Lue said. "If he can 
throw, it will help us a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes joins a deep staff at Narbonne, which returns All-Pacific League 
right-hander Craig Valenzuela and junior left-hander Jason Donaldson. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro's basketball team, led by senior guard Devon Hamilton, is off to an 
11-2 start, its best start in many years. The Pirates took third place last 
week in the L.A. Invitational Tournament. . . . Palos Verdes had its 30-game 
unbeaten streak snapped Saturday by Ocean View of Huntington Beach, 2-0, in the 
final of the South Torrance Holiday Soccer Classic. The Sea Kings, two-time 
defending Southern Section 4-A champions, were 27-0-3 over two seasons before 
the loss. In the girls' title game, Palos Verdes tied Chaffey, 1-1. . . . 
Damond Smith of Hawthorne has been invited to compete in the 60-yard hurdles at 
the Sunkist Invitational indoor track meet Jan. 18 at the Sports Arena. Smith 
has a best of 14.57 seconds in the 110-meter high hurdles. . . . The semifinals 
of the 24th annual Torrance Basketball tournament will be held at 6 and 7:30

FOUR SOUTH BAY PLAYERS ARE NAMED TO SUPER TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four South Bay football players have been named to the All-CIF Southern Section 
all-star team, honoring the finest players from the section's 10 divisions, and 
were among 21 area standouts chosen to all-division teams. 
</P>
<P>
The selections, made by members of the Amateur Athletic Foundation/First 
Interstate Bank board of sportswriters, were announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The 48-player All-Southern Section super team included offensive lineman Brian 
Malcolm and running back-defensive back Jerald Henry of Serra, kicker Brett 
Ostergard of Miraleste and linebacker David Bohner of Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm, Henry and Ostergard were first-team selections. Bohner was named to 
the second team. The 6-foot-3, 280-pound Malcolm was the top lineman for a 
Serra team that went 10-1 and reached the Division VII semifinals. Henry was 
the South Bay's most explosive player, rushing for 1,705 yards in 160 carries 
(a 10-yard average) and leading the area with 25 touchdowns. Ostergard made 11 
of 15 field-goal attempts for Miraleste, including a 57-yarder. Bohner was the 
leader of a Palos Verdes team that reached the Division VIII final. 
</P>
<P>
Lompoc running back NapoleanKaufman was named the section's offensive player of 
the year and Loyola linebacker Andrew Casani and Bishop Amat end Jason 
Patterson were co-defensive players of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Three South Bay players were selected to the All-Division III team. They were 
offensive linemen Jared Tuione of Hawthorne and Mike Donnelly of Leuzinger, and 
linebacker Manny Gonzalez of Leuzinger. 
</P>
<P>
In Division VII, the area selections were Henry, Malcolm and linebacker Alex 
Marcelin of Serra, and Ostergard. 
</P>
<P>
The All-Division VIII team included 12 South Bay standouts. Palos Verdes led 
the way with three selections -- Bohner, running back George Felactu and 
offensive lineman Brandon Himelwright -- followed by West Torrance, South 
Torrance and Morningside with two choices each. 
</P>
<P>
Selected were running back Alex Schultz and offensive lineman Josh Gormley of 
West, defensive lineman Kevin Jones and defensive back David Rosato of South, 
and linebacker Danny Katoa and defensive back Kenny Birdine of Ocean League 
champion Morningside. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills running back Robert Coulter, an All-Division II pick last year, 
Torrance offensive lineman Wade Owens and Mira Costa linebacker Simi Fonua 
rounded out the South Bay's Division VIII selections. 
</P>
<P>
The All-Division IX team was represented locally by offensive lineman Mike 
Patapoff and defensive back Matt Redlew of Santa Fe League champion Mary Star.

LOWERY IS LATEST IN LINE OF SHOOTING STARS FOR LIONS; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: JUNIOR GUARD HAS SCORED 40 POINTS OR MORE IN FOUR OF LOYOLA 
MARYMOUNT'S NINE GAMES. HE IS RANKED EIGHTH IN THE NATION IN SCORING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Loyola Marymount's Terrell Lowery likes a challenge, so he drove the lane 
against Louisiana State's towering Shaquille O'Neal last week and tried to 
shoot a high-arcing one-hander over the 7-footer, who swatted the ball but was 
called for goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later the scene was replayed with the same result, and a grinning 
Lowery got right in O'Neal's face to tell him: "You can't block everything, big 
man." Lowery finished with 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
A few days earlier, Lowery had a similar exchange with Oklahoma guard Brent 
Price, who was on his way to scoring 56 points against the Lions. Price had 
just converted a steal into a basket and was laughing. 
</P>
<P>
"He was high-fiving everybody and talking kind of cocky, and I told him, 'Let's 
see you do that to me,' " Lowery said. He partially offset Price's performance 
with 41 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount junior may have a cocky streak himself, but he needs every 
edge to maintain the pace he has set this season and the responsibility that 
has been placed on him by Coach Jay Hillock. 
</P>
<P>
In taking over the bulk of Loyola's scoring this season, Hillock knew he would 
have less firepower than recent Loyola teams and was expecting Lowery to pick 
up some of the scoring slack. The junior out of Oakland has generally answered 
the bell, scoring 40 points or more in four of Loyola's nine games and 
averaging 29.4 points, combining long-range accuracy with a variety of 
ambidextrous moves around the basket. 
</P>
<P>
In the most recent NCAA statistics, Lowery ranked eighth in the nation in 
scoring. He is shooting 47.5% from the field and 85.5% from the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hillock's and Lowery's careers have been complicated by a spate of 
Loyola injuries that has left the Lions with virtually no depth at guard. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hillock originally wanted Lowery to be the Lions' shooting guard, he 
has had to be the point guard as well. Before the season, point guard Tony 
Walker, the returning starter, was lost with a wrist injury. More recently, 
freshman Greg Evans suffered a leg injury and has missed the past two games. 
</P>
<P>
With the lack of backup at the point position, Lowery has to play nearly every 
minute, a challenge for anyone in Loyola's breakneck system. As a sophomore, 
Lowery averaged about 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Lowery goes into tonight's game at the University of the Pacific averaging 9.5 
assists, placing him in the top five in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind" the double duty, he said. "I was recruited as a point guard. I 
happen to have a few skills to allow me (to score). We don't have Bo (Kimble) 
and Hank (Gathers) and (Jeff) Fryer anymore and I have to score. For us to win 
I have to score more. 
</P>
<P>
"Any way for my team to win, that's what I want to do. It hurts without Tony 
being here. And now (the injury to) Greg Evans puts more pressure on me, I have 
to play more minutes with teams keying on me." 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't slowed Lowery much. After a poor start in which he appeared to be 
forcing his shots, Hillock told Lowery to think about passing off early in the 
game, then look to shoot once the defense was distracted. Lowery responded with 
a 40-point game against Chaminade and has averaged nearly 33 points in the past 
seven games, with a high of 48 in a victory over Idaho State. 
</P>
<P>
In his consecutive 40-point games against Oklahoma and LSU -- both on national 
television -- Lowery made 67% of his shots, including 10 of 16 from three-point 
range, and still had 21 assists. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to depend on Terrell for that much every night," Hillock said. 
</P>
<P>
But Hillock has little choice. When Lowery comes out for a breather, the team 
invariably has trouble handling the ball. When Lowery's shooting touch is off, 
the Lions' offense sputters despite their 111.9-point average. 
</P>
<P>
His shooting was off Saturday against Georgia Tech, but Lowery still managed to 
come within a rebound of his first triple-double: 26 points, 10 assists and 
nine rebounds. But the Lions lost and Lowery wasn't impressed with his box 
score line. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to do something (besides score)," he said. "I couldn't hit (bleep)." 
</P>
<P>
As the Lions' scoring star, coming on the heels of back-to-back national 
scoring titles by Gathers and Kimble, Lowery has become the focus not only of 
enemy defenses, but of young autograph hunters at road games. But Lowery's 
approach is that reputation doesn't mean much and that a player is only as good 
as his last game. That's why he planned to test even as intimidating a player 
as O'Neal, the nation's most dominant big man. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't put a lot in what I hear," he said. "I'm the kind of guy, you pretty 
much have to show me." 
</P>
<P>
In stumbling to a 2-7 start, the Lions have shown a lot of holes and admittedly 
have been overwhelmed by a schedule heavy on ranked opponents and light on home 
games. Lowery said he hopes what the team has learned in its losses can be 
transferred into victories when West Coast Conference play begins Jan. 11.

1ST BLAZE HAD FIREFIGHTERS AT THE READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the time most Los Angeles city firefighters arrived on the scene Wednesday, 
the blaze at the Bed, Bath and Beyond store on Ventura Boulevard was already 
out, dowsed by the store's automatic sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency over, "we were just getting ready to get back to the station," 
Firefighter Dan Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Assistant Fire Chief Richard Olsen, looking east, saw the smoke. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got there when it was declared knocked down, and then I saw this one," 
Olsen said as firefighters mopped up after blazes gutted two stores and damaged 
three others a few blocks away from the bath shop. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen scrambled to his car and raced to the intersection of Ventura and Laurel 
Canyon boulevards, three blocks away. En route, his radio crackled with the 
first reports of 911 calls about the flames, which sent twin black plumes 
soaring from Pier 1 Imports and Strouds Linen Warehouse in the 12100 block of 
Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, it was all quite lucky. A crew of fully outfitted firefighters was 
just down the street, ready to go. Also, Olsen, a seasoned fire chief, was at 
the scene in moments and could quickly assess the extent of the blaze and the 
force needed to fight it. 
</P>
<P>
He ordered in 50 firefighters -- later augmenting them with 75 others. They 
brought the fires under control within 20 minutes. It took 50 minutes more to 
snuff out the flames. 
</P>
<P>
As he put it, Olsen made a quick reconnaissance of the scene when he first 
arrived, driving through the parking lot behind the stores first, suspecting 
that fire broke out in back storage rooms. Flames leaped out the windows. Olsen 
circled the block and discovered the scene wasn't much better on Ventura 
Boulevard, where "I could see fire blowing out the front." 
</P>
<P>
At first, it appeared to be a coincidence that fire crews were so close to the 
blazes, but arson investigators later said the three fires were intentionally 
set. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said the unusually quick response helped keep the fires from 
spreading throughout the block of storefronts in Studio City. Although the 
fires at Pier 1 and Strouds caused $2.5 million damage, most of the rest of the 
block was untouched. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the billowing black clouds that attracted crowds of onlookers and 
slowed traffic on nearby freeways, the fires were relatively easy to battle, 
Olsen said. Fire officials quickly set up a central command post between Laurel 
Canyon and Vantage Avenue and divided their forces into an east and west 
branch, directing both forces simultaneously from the center. 
</P>
<P>
The fires presented at least one tense moment for firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
Three firefighters had entered the front door of Pier 1 and were about 20 feet 
into the building when their colleagues saw the smoke turn an ominous 
greenish-gray through the display windows. When smoke in a confined space turns 
this color, engineer Dan Thompson said, it's a sign of a potential "back draft" 
-- firefighter jargon for a fireball that erupts when carbon monoxide explodes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a smoke explosion," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters rushed into the building, yelling at the three men to get out, 
while others broke the display windows to release the carbon monoxide which had 
built up. The danger quickly passed, but if a back draft had occurred, "it 
would have blown across the street," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Garrett said, "it was pretty cut and dry."

3 CHARGED IN KILLING OF SECURITY GUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Murder charges were filed Wednesday against three gang members suspected of 
gunning down a security guard while trying to steal his gun behind a North 
Hollywood movie theater in March. 
</P>
<P>
Charles R. Doll, 51, died in a hail of gunfire on the top level of a parking 
structure behind Century 7 Theatres in the 12800 block of Victory Boulevard on 
March 11. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Castillo, 20, Juan Martinez, 19, and Jesse Tarver, 20, all of Los 
Angeles, were identified through fingerprints found in a stolen car parked near 
Doll's body, Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Nison said. 
</P>
<P>
The three also were charged Wednesday with four counts of robbery stemming from 
an incident the same night in West Hollywood. In addition, Nison said, the men 
are suspected in several other robberies still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Because Doll was killed during a robbery attempt, prosecutors have the option 
of pursuing the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Nison said the three men went to the theater to steal Doll's gun. Martinez 
allegedly wrestled with the guard while trying to grab the gun. Nison said 
Castillo and Tarver, each of whom was armed, shot Doll several times during the 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Doll, who was employed by a private security firm retained by the theater to 
patrol the parking structure, was on his second day on the job when he was 
killed. His body was found by theater patrons who heard shots about 11:45 p.m. 
He had been shot at least six times and died at the scene, Nison said. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo, Martinez and Tarver were identified through fingerprints found in a 
silver 1984 Honda Prelude, which had been stolen about 90 minutes before the 
shooting outside a West Hollywood nightclub, Nison said. In that incident, two 
or three armed men demanded a car and money from four people in the 7900 block 
of Santa Monica Boulevard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Castillo was arrested Friday in Sunland. Martinez and Tarver already were in 
custody on other charges. Castillo and Martinez will be arraigned Jan. 3 in San 
Fernando Municipal Court. An arraignment date had not been set for Tarver.

NOISE, TRAFFIC EXPECTED FROM SEWER PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed $9.2-million sewer expansion project in North Hollywood will 
generate noise and traffic congestion during the nine months of its 
construction, an environmental study has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
"Construction noise would reach significant levels at points along the proposed 
project alignment and could disturb small mammals and birds," the city report 
said. But the report said any disruption caused by the project, which is now 
scheduled to begin in 1991, will only be temporary and will end when the 
project is finished nine months later. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental report covering the North Hollywood Interceptor Sewer project 
has been sent to the City Council, which has not yet scheduled a debate on 
whether to authorize construction. 
</P>
<P>
City public works officials, who proposed the project last year, said the new 
sewers are needed to alleviate strain that has been placed on the sewer system 
by population growth in the area. North Hollywood is now served by sewers 
constructed in the late 1920s and early 193Os, when the population was far less 
than what it is now. 
</P>
<P>
"Sewers are flowing above their designed capacity. There's more people living 
in the area and contributing to those sewers," said Bill Briggs, a city 
engineering designer. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for construction of 3.8 miles of new sewer lines, primarily along 
Cahuenga Boulevard between Burbank Boulevard and Valley Spring Lane, and along 
Burbank Boulevard between Tujunga Avenue and Cahuenga Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The expanded lines, which will be made of reinforced concrete and hardened clay 
piping, will be installed in cavities now used by existing sewer lines and 
other underground utilities, Briggs said. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact report now circulating has concluded that the project 
will not cause any significant permanent environmental damage. But the report 
said construction will cause tremendous traffic congestion in the area, 
particularly along Burbank Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report said the construction work will generate noise, which 
will disturb classes at Toluca Lake Elementary School, Crossroads preschool and 
Cahuenga Nursery School. 
</P>
<P>
Adult classes and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings that take place at Toluca Lake 
United Methodist Church and services at a Jehovah's Witnesses meeting hall will 
probably be disturbed by noise, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Some Sunland and Tujunga residents have expressed concerns that the sewer 
system expansion will facilitate further growth in the area, allowing the 
present population of 50,000 to double. 
</P>
<P>
But Wallace Stokes, the city's environmental coordinator for the project, said 
the community has already been zoned for a lot of growth, which will occur 
regardless of whether the sewers have been improved or not. 
</P>
<P>
The new sewer is expected to serve the area for about 100 years, Stokes said. 
</P>
<P>
City residents have until Jan. 18 to submit comments on the environmental 
impact report to the city Department of Public Works.

STUDIO CITY: HUNDREDS STARE AT WRECKAGE OF DESTROYED AND DAMAGED STORES AND 
MURMURS ABOUT ARSON ARE HEARD.

<P>
A fortune in guitars and a neighborhood atmosphere went up in smoke Wednesday 
in Studio City, leaving an aftermath of blackened ruins and baffled suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
The day began like any other in the strip just west of Laurel Canyon Boulevard, 
with shoppers roaming the quaint storefronts and diners crammed into delis. 
Moviegoers took in a matinee of "The Russia House." 
</P>
<P>
The fire brought smoke and screams. Families with small children ran and 
frightened pedestrians rushed into restaurants. Shoppers coughed in the smoke. 
Overheated windows in burning buildings exploded glass into the street. 
</P>
<P>
Employees of a nearby supermarket scrambled onto their roof, one with a fire 
extinguisher, another with a camera. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, hundreds of people stared at the wreckage of destroyed and 
damaged stores, whispering rumors about firebombs and arson and gasoline cans. 
</P>
<P>
Al Carness, co-owner of Valley Arts Guitars, lamented the loss of approximately 
400 guitars that he said were worth about $600,000. Many of them were custom 
made for well-known musicians, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was able to save only one guitar -- a Les Paul model signed by many famous 
studio players. 
</P>
<P>
Other than that, "We lost everything up there," said Mark Simon, the store's 
purchasing manager. "We didn't have time to save anything. The smoke just 
started pouring in. We had to save ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
As he talked with an insurance adjuster, Carness said he was not sure when the 
store would reopen. He said he will spend the next couple of days counting 
inventory. 
</P>
<P>
"Counting melted picks," said his wife, Fern. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel all right about it," Carness said. "I've had lots of ups and downs. We 
can always rebuild and no one was hurt." He pinched the bridge of his nose as 
if to stop himself from crying. 
</P>
<P>
As the cleanup began, many pedestrians, apparently content that the trouble had 
passed, resumed shopping and eating. But some merchants and shoppers, and 
residents who live around the strip, wondered who could have brought this havoc 
on one of the last neighborhood-oriented strips on busy Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what really scares me?" asked Claire Heimler of Hollywood, an 
onlooker who had been on her way to an after-Christmas sale at Strouds Linen 
Warehouse, one of the stores destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep looking in the faces of people who are passing by, trying to figure out 
who did it. I mean, I would guess that the person would have stayed here. Who 
would do something like this and not stay to see it?" 
</P>
<P>
Heimler said she has been shopping on the strip for about 32 years, "when half 
the stores that are here now weren't here." She said she enjoyed the quaintness 
and hospitality of the area. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll still keep coming here, but it's a little scary," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some expressed anger. Larry Foster, 47, a hotel designer who lives around the 
corner from the stores, said he was pruning roses in his front yard when he saw 
the flames above Strouds. 
</P>
<P>
"This is such a quiet neighborhood, but it's changing, and this causes me a lot 
of concern," said Foster, who has lived in his house for 10 years. "Now there's 
lots of graffiti and homeless walking around. This fire doesn't make me want to 
move. I guess something like this could have happened on Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"But it does make you think. L.A has sure changed." 
</P>
<P>
Angela Schmeltzer, 17, a waitress at Weby's Dely and Bakery, located across the 
street from the fire scene, said she was frightened. 
</P>
<P>
"This makes me more scared, and people are getting paranoid around here," she 
said. A nearby newsstand had been robbed the day before, she said, "and folks 
around here don't know what's going to happen. If this can happen in the 
daytime, then anything can." 
</P>
<P>
The concerns of other onlookers were more personal. Susan Genelin, an artist 
and activist with the Sierra Club, anxiously craned her neck in the direction 
of Mrs. Fields Cookies, hoping to see her 18-year-old daughter, who works at 
the store. 
</P>
<P>
"I was driving along the Hollywood Freeway when I heard about the fire," she 
said. "At first, I thought it was in Fryman Canyon, which the Sierra Club has 
fought very hard to save, and I was terrified. Then I heard it was on Ventura 
Boulevard in Studio City, and I was even more scared because of my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
Genelin later learned from a firefighter that no one in the cookie store had 
been injured. "He said that's everything's OK, and that's good enough for me," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is so unsettling. Everyone will be scared to come down here now." 
</P>

WESTLAKE'S PRESTON TO PLAY FOOTBALL FOR CAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Todd Preston of Westlake High, who began the 1990 season as a relatively 
unheralded college quarterback prospect, has orally committed to attend 
California in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Preston, the Marmonte League's most valuable offensive player as a junior and 
senior, said Wednesday that he will sign a letter of intent with Cal on Feb. 6, 
the first day of the next signing period for high school seniors. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-3, 180-pound Preston, who completed 166 of 285 passes for 2,427 
yards and 21 touchdowns in leading Westlake to an 8-2-1 record, took a 
recruiting trip to Cal last weekend and to the University of the Pacific a week 
earlier before commiting to the Pacific 10 Conference school on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
"I went (to Cal) thinking I wanted to go there, and everything I saw convinced 
me that it was the place for me," said Preston, an All-Southern Section 
Division II selection. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the coaches, I liked the players, and I liked the campus. It's also a 
good academic school, and that was a big plus." 
</P>
<P>
Preston became the Westlake starter in the second game of his sophomore season 
after splitting time with senior Chris Edwards in a season-opening 17-14 loss 
to Buena. During his career, he completed 391 of 785 passes for 5,608 yards and 
46 touchdowns. He threw 43 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
He ranks second on the all-time Ventura County career passing yardage list 
behind Tim Gutierrez, who threw for 7,272 yards for Santa Clara from 1987-89. 
</P>
<P>
Preston said he also was heavily recruited by Pac-10 schools Oregon, 
Washington, Washington State and USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of wanted to play for a Pac-10 school, but that's not the only reason I 
went to Cal, and not Pacific," Preston said. "I just really felt comfortable up 
there. There are a lot of guys on the team who went to high school down here, 
so we've got something in common."

KIRKSEY, 23, COMPLETING TOUR OF DUTY AS VALLEY COLLEGE CENTER AFTER 4-YEAR 
STINT IN THE MARINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Valley College center Art Kirksey knows that he could be among the thousands of 
U. S. Marines stationed in Saudi Arabia. Luckily, he finished his four-year 
hitch in 1989, at a time when the Marines still were looking for a few good 
basketball players instead of combat-ready troops. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on the base team and all I did was play basketball," said Kirksey, who 
traveled to Japan and the Philippines to play games. "It was my job." 
</P>
<P>
But the Marines apparently do not train their basketball players as thoroughly 
as their soldiers. "He received no instruction or structure," Valley College 
Coach Jim Stephens said. "It was more like pickup basketball." 
</P>
<P>
Although Kirksey, 23, came out of the Marines as an expert with an M16 rifle, 
his court sense and mechanics were lacking. However, Kirksey always has been 
able to compensate for his deficiencies by being "a great leaper," Stephens 
said, "as good an athlete as I've coached in 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-4 Kirksey was a raw, unknown walk-on when he tried out for the 
Valley basketball team this fall. "I didn't expect him to make it," Stephens 
said. Neither did Kirksey, who says, "I was skeptical." 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey, older than anybody on the team but Navy veteran Nathan Hall, made 
giant strides in only a few weeks of practice. When the season began, he was 
the starting center, a shot-blocking whiz. 
</P>
<P>
In one early game, he swatted away seven balls in the first half alone. He 
leads the team in blocked shots and rebounds but, more significantly, he has 
become what Stephens believes is the key to the Monarchs' fortunes this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We're only going to be as good as he is," said Stephens, whose team has a 9-7 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Monarchs, Kirksey's development seems to have reached a 
plateau. "His progress has stopped," Stephens said, "and he's not reacting to 
the situations in the game. His maturity should show but it doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey, an affable Alabaman, knows he was in the coach's doghouse for a while, 
but he is not about to make excuses. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got here I had to prove myself, but after I did, I lost my 
determination and drive," he said. "I disappointed myself the last couple of 
games. I also disappointed the coach and I feel bad." 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey has a history of being an athletic underachiever. In high schools in 
Birmingham and Leeds, Ala., Kirksey paid more attention to social hi-jinks than 
to sports. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of wild," he said. He started at center for two seasons in 
basketball but quit football rather than switch from running back to wide 
receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't dedicated but I had good athletic ability," said Kirksey, whose older 
brother William plays on special teams for the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey's jumping ability was apparent at an early age. "I could dunk in the 
eighth grade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey said he had "a couple of offers" to play college basketball but decided 
to enlist in the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't ready for college," he said. "I saw friends flunk out because they 
didn't take school seriously. I didn't want that to happen to me." 
</P>
<P>
Kirksey, who hopes to put his deep baritone to use in broadcasting, was ready 
for college after the Marines and is happy with his academic progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to class and put forth the effort," said Kirksey, who lives in Panorama 
City with his sister Shannon and is going to school on the GI Bill. "If I'd 
gone to college right out of high school, I wouldn't be doing this good. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school, if I failed to see the relevance of a class, I neglected it." 
</P>
<P>
After finishing at Valley next year, Kirksey would like to play basketball at a 
four-year college, but he has not zoned in on any region in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother wants me to move to Minnesota, but I think it's too cold for me," 
Kirksey said. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, Stephens is more concerned about whether Kirksey reaches his 
potential on the court. 
</P>
<P>
"What he does in the next month will determine how far he'll go," Stephens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Kirksey said he will rededicate himself. He enjoys playing at 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
After all, a green-and-gold Monarchs uniform might not be as glamorous as a 
desert-camouflage outfit, but chances are you won't be shot at for wearing it.

HART TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
HOST'S GUARDS MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN 86-50 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Although the Hart High basketball team's front line averages better than 
6-foot-5, Coach Greg Herrick believes that the productivity of the guards is 
the best indicator of how well the team is playing. 
</P>
<P>
"The guards are the Rodney Dangerfield of the team," Herrick said. "Nobody 
respects them. If you want to know how the transition game is going, just look 
how many points Tony Valenzuela scored." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night in an 86-50 victory over Alemany in the first round of the Hart 
tournament, the transition game was operating at full tilt. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela scored a game-high 23 points, connecting on 10 of 15 from the field, 
and Doug Rich handed out five assists. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot depends upon our running game," said Valenzuela, who made nine of 10 
from two-point range. "We have to execute and things will fall into place." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela scored Hart's first six points and had nine in the first period to 
help his team build a 21-9 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Hart (6-5) held Alemany (4-6) scoreless for more than three minutes during a 
12-0 run midway through the second quarter that extended its lead to 39-18. 
</P>
<P>
Hart forward Marty Downen (19 points) and center Ali Peek (11) each blocked two 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany's Richard Dice and Will Burr, restricted by a triangle-and-two defense 
for much of the game, scored 13 and 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas 88, Paraclete 59 -- Calabasas scored 20 unanswered points in the 
fourth quarter. Greg Waugh of Calabasas led all scorers with 26. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale 62, Beverly Hills 50 -- Jason Harper had 16 points and eight rebounds 
and Mike Wright had 11 points and 11 rebounds for Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando 42, Rio Mesa 40 -- Gerald Harris scored 19 points for San 
Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus 86, Cabrillo 51 -- Greg Yumbar and Geoff Dains led Saugus (8-3) with 16 
and 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake 101, Hart JV 38 -- John Van Spyk led six Westlake players in double 
figures with 19. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley 58, St. Francis 52 -- Kyle Barrett led St. Francis with a 
game-high 19 points and Willie Montgomery led Antelope Valley with 15. 
</P>
<P>
East Bakersfield 42, Palmdale 37 -- Palmdale limited its foe to two points in 
the third quarter but was outscored, 18-9, in the fourth.

FISHER LOST FOR SEASON AFTER GPA FALLS SHORT; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE CENTER MISSES ACADEMIC ELIGIBILITY 
STANDARD BY ONE-HUNDREDTH OF A POINT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Hours before embarking on a lengthy trip into subzero temperatures, the Cal 
State Northridge basketball team was dealt an icy blow when it lost center 
Percy Fisher for the season because of academic ineligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher missed the fall semester because his cumulative grade-point average fell 
below 2.0, the university standard for student-athletes. 
</P>
<P>
He expected to join the team this morning on its trip for games against Idaho 
State in Pocatello, Ida., on Friday, and against Weber State in Ogden, Utah, on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But Fisher learned late Wednesday night that he had come up one-hundredth of a 
point short. He has a 1.99 GPA. 
</P>
<P>
"It is frustrating," said Pete Cassidy, coach of the 2-6 Matadors. "I wouldn't 
say all is lost without him but he is definitely a talent that would have 
enhanced our chances of success." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-7, 212-pound sophomore from San Francisco's Riordan High runs the 
floor with speed, is powerful inside and can shoot from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
"Percy, without a doubt is more made for Division I basketball than any big man 
on our team, especially me," said CSUN's 6-7, 300-pound starting center, Todd 
Bowser. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Fisher averaged 4.4 points and 3.3 rebounds a game in a reserve 
role. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on his stats, you wouldn't say he was much but you have to see him 
play," Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was our most improved player last year. His best basketball is still ahead 
of him. He was only 17 when he came to us, a young Bambi. He has marvelous 
physical talents." 
</P>
<P>
Like Fisher, teammate Erik Cooper sat out the Matadors' first eight games and 
had hoped to rejoin the team, but he will not be able to make the trip either. 
His grades for the fall semester were not received in time by Dean Edward 
Peckham. 
</P>
<P>
If Cooper's grades arrive by Wednesday and he receives all the credits he 
needs, he will be eligible to play that night when Northridge plays host to 
Canisius College. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's cumulative GPA was above 2.0, but he unwittingly repeated a class and 
subsequently came up short on credits. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, the 6-3 guard from Pasadena City College averaged 2.1 points a 
game in a limited role.

AIR IS CLEANEST SINCE MONITORING BEGAN IN '73; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: A COUNTY OFFICIAL SAYS THE WEATHER AND TIGHTER REGULATIONS ON 
INDUSTRY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE GOOD SHOWING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Air quality during 1990 was better in Ventura County than it has been since 
pollution monitoring began in 1973, officials at the county Air Pollution 
Control District said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The county violated federal health standards for ozone pollution on only 16 
days in 1990, compared to 45 days in 1989 and a 10-year average of 51 days. 
</P>
<P>
The county's air failed the more stringent California health standards on 100 
days in 1990, compared to an average of 130 days a year over the previous 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which combines Los Angeles, 
Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties to form the smoggiest air basin 
in the state and the nation, also enjoyed fewer air quality violations in 1990, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast district violated federal standards on 130 days in 1990 
compared to 157 days in 1989. It failed state standards on 180 days in 1990 and 
on 211 days in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But officials in both districts said Wednesday that they cannot claim much of 
the credit for the surprisingly good air quality of 1990. Weather factors were 
primarily responsible, said Richard H. Baldwin, Ventura County's air pollution

"With the cooler than normal temperatures and better than normal winds, we 
didn't have the emissions sitting around to be cooked by the sunlight to form 
ozone," Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
District regulations on industry, which have reduced emissions that cause ozone 
by 25% over the last 10 years, also helped keep the ozone levels low in 1990, 
Baldwin said. Another factor, he added, was the effect of state regulations 
mandating reductions in motor vehicle tailpipe emissions. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of the weather make dramatic changes from one year to the next, but 
results of emission reduction regulations show up over the long term, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a gradual improvement in air quality in Ventura County and 
statewide, despite population and industrial growth. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, air quality throughout the state has remained the same or slightly 
improved in the face of significant growth," said Bill Sessa, spokesman for the 
California Air Resources Board, which sets air quality policy for the state. 
</P>
<P>
The exception to the statewide trend is the San Joaquin Valley, where growth 
has been so intense in the last 10 years that air quality is worsening despite 
regulations, Sessa said. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone, a primary ingredient of photochemical smog, is formed when oxides of 
nitrogen react with hydrocarbons in sunlight. In Ventura County, the primary 
emission sources are motor vehicles and Southern California Edison power 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
The state and federal standards for ozone are based on the level at which ozone 
affects health, said Dr. Michael Lipsett, public health medical officer at the 
state Department of Health Services in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
According to federal standards, health is affected when the ozone concentration 
in the air reaches .12 parts per million. State standards put the health hazard 
at anything over .09 parts per million. 
</P>
<P>
Ozone pollution causes the lungs to lose their elasticity, decreasing their 
ability to deliver oxygen to the blood. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the inflammatory changes that take place in the lungs from 
exposure to ozone, they are very similar to the effects of early cigarette 
smoking," Lipsett said. 
</P>
<P>
Some tests show that ozone can also induce asthmatic episodes. The National 
Toxicology Program is also studying whether chronic ozone exposure can be 
linked to cancer, Lipsett said.

LAST-MINUTE BUYING SURGE ISN'T ENOUGH; 
</P>
<P>
SHOPPING: ONE VENTURA STORE REPORTS A SATURDAY SALES RECORD. BUT MANY RETAILERS 
SAY THE HOLIDAY SEASON WAS DISAPPOINTING. 
</P>

<P>
A surge of last-minute shoppers helped Ventura County retailers put some 
sparkle on an otherwise lackluster Christmas season last weekend, but even 
though the final three shopping days exceeded expectations, most store managers 
said the season as a whole didn't measure up to last year. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, especially, was busy at many stores, with at least one, the JC Penney 
unit in Ventura, reporting all-time record sales that day. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Tovar, the store's general merchandise manager, declined to give 
figures, but said Saturday's sales broke all single-day records at the Penney 
store, which opened in the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire weekend was really crowded," she said. "In fact, thanks to the cold 
weather, we just about ran out of coats and other outer wear." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the strong finish, Tovar said she didn't know whether this year's 
holiday sales equaled those of Christmas, 1989. Store manager Jim Word said 
last week that "we'll probably come out about even" with last year. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Jones, general manager of the K mart store in Ventura, said his store had 
an excellent final weekend. "But in the weeks leading up to that, we didn't 
come up to our projections," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As did Tovar at Penney's, Jones reported strong demand for coats and sweaters. 
Among toys, he said Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle items moved well. 
</P>
<P>
"In view of the soft economy and the situation in the Persian Gulf, I'd say it 
was a good Christmas," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Sears, Roebuck store in Oxnard, manager Don Facciono said, "The weekend 
was extremely good throughout the store. Having Christmas fall on a Tuesday was 
a retailer's dream." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "It was a matter of 'everything goes.' If we were out of something, 
the customer got something else." 
</P>
<P>
But although the weekend was stronger than expected, "it didn't make up for the 
season as a whole." Facciono described this year's holiday business as "good, 
but not up to our expectations." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Hoxmeier, manager of the Target discount store in Simi Valley, said his 
store did better than expected last weekend. Right up to Christmas Day, 
Hoxmeier said, Target benefited from customers' price-consciousness this 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say we had a better season this year than last. Besides the long final 
weekend, we also had a longer season, because Thanksgiving came a week earlier 
than last year." 
</P>
<P>
At Hoffritz for Cutlery in The Oaks Mall in Thousand Oaks, $40 Swiss Army 
knives, $100 electric shavers, $130 manicure sets and $170 sets of knives 
accompanied by wood blocks sold well as the season ended, said manager Tammy 
Swanstrom. 
</P>
<P>
"The final four days, starting last Friday, were quite good for us," Swanstrom 
said. "If it hadn't been for a slow November, we would have exceeded last year. 
As it was, we came fairly close." 
</P>
<P>
And Suzanne Crittendon, manager of the AT&amp;T Phone Center in Ventura's 
Buenaventura Mall, said she not only sold many gift phones in the final 
shopping weekend, but found time to fax a dozen free messages to service 
personnel in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"Throughout the Christmas season, we've been sending 10 to 12 messages a day, 
seven days a week" as part of AT&amp;T's Desert Fax program, she said. "One 
lady comes in almost every afternoon to fax a message to her husband." 
</P>
<P>
As for the retail outlook for 1991, Sears' Facciono said, "I feel the year will 
start out with everybody being cautious -- until Jan. 15. If the Middle East 
crisis is settled, I expect people to loosen up."

STATE DEADLINE JAN. 1 FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERRY BRAILO SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Owners of assault weapons such as AKs and Uzis must register them with the 
California Department of Justice before Jan. 1, according to the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
The three sheriff's stations in the county -- Ventura, Camarillo and Thousand 
Oaks -- have registration cards and instructions. 
</P>
<P>
The state registration fee is $20 per weapon. Also required is a thumbprint, 
which the Sheriff's Department will take for a $3 fee. 
</P>
<P>
"People must take this responsibility seriously or they run the risk of 
imprisonment, a fine and the loss of the weapon," Assistant Sheriff Oscar 
Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller said there are no statistics available on how many assault weapons are 
in the county, "but there are over 300,000 in the state, and I would expect 
that we have a share of those." 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who wants to turn in an assault weapon rather than register it may 
transfer it to a licensed gun dealer or contact a local law enforcement agency 
for instructions. 
</P>
<P>
"We would appreciate no unexpected arrivals at police headquarters. We prefer 
they would call ahead," Fuller said. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

KEEPERS OF CITY HALL RETIRE AFTER 33 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fillmore City Hall has the immaculate look it wore when it was built in the 
1950s, thanks in part to the efforts of Estefana Robles, 71, and her sister, 
Carmen, 60. 
</P>
<P>
The first and only custodians of Fillmore's government offices on Sespe Avenue 
retired Dec. 21 after working for 12 mayors during 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
On the job Tuesday and Thursday evenings during about 800 council meetings and 
400 Planning Commission sessions, the lifelong Fillmore residents were not 
distracted by decisions being made in council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
"Every once in a while, we'd hear a few words," said Estefana Robles, "but I 
can't be listening all the time -- I'd forget what I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
Although the city hired only Estefana and she was the only one on the payroll, 
younger sister Carmen was on the job from the first, as companion and 
assistant, Estefana said. 
</P>
<P>
Middle children of a family of 12, they are daughters of a farm laborer who had 
never been to school, said Estefana Robles, whose education stopped when she 
went to work after fifth grade. She said she didn't apply for the City Hall job 
but was approached by the city after friends who knew of her housekeeping 
skills recommended her. 
</P>
<P>
Veda Southwick, city finance director from 1968 to 1988, characterized the 
Robles sisters as scrupulously honest and industrious. "I don't think there 
could have been any more diligent people, but they like to joke and have fun. 
They had a lot of work to do, but they never complained. They were like one of 
the family." 
</P>
<P>
Carmen worked two jobs "and if she had to, she would come in at 10 p.m. to help 
finish up," Southwick said. 
</P>
<P>
While the work has remained constant, the city of Fillmore itself has undergone 
many changes. Estefana remembers knowing nearly everyone in town. Today, she 
said, "I see so many new faces -- there are very few people I know now, except 
for the old-timers." With a 1990 census count of 11,450, Fillmore has gained 
7,000 residents since the two sisters went to work for the city. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting, City Council members gave the pair a key to the city. 
Commending the sisters for their quiet efficiency and dependability, Mayor 
Scott Lee said that Estefana and Carmen Robles "have become friends to us all, 
and they will be missed." JANET BERGAMO

RECOGNITION FOR MEALS PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I feel that I need to clarify one point in the article on Project Understanding 
(Dec. 5). The article made a passing reference to a meals program. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which serves five meals each week, is called Family to Family. 
</P>
<P>
It is staffed by volunteers and is supported by donations from these volunteers 
and from the churches and groups which these volunteers represent. While 
Project Understanding has worked closely with Family to Family since its 
beginnings, it was not started by Project Understanding. Family to Family was 
well established by the time it came under Project Understanding's umbrella in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
I thought that, in fairness to the thousands of volunteers who have made Family 
to Family the highly successful and efficient program that it is, this 
clarification needed to be made.

OUR 'PARKING STRUCTURE' IS FULL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few weeks ago, I had an experience trying to park in Santa Monica and it 
helped clarify my thinking on the Jordan Ranch proposal. I needed to park at a 
surgical center, but the parking structure was full. I asked the attendant if I 
could park along the side of the driveway or on the landing between the levels 
where I could see space was available. He very politely explained that the 
structure was built to accommodate only a certain number of cars, that it 
contained that many cars and that I would have to secure parking elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to our air quality, water resources and traffic flow, our 
"parking structure" is full. We are already experiencing several days a year of 
brown air and high ozone levels. Water rationing may become a likely part of 
our future. Anyone who drives a car can attest that our traffic levels already 
cause agonizing and frustrating delays. According to the environmental impact 
report of the Jordan Ranch, this development will make matters much, much 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
The report for Jordan Ranch states that if the development takes place, we will 
need to widen several local roads. Kanan Road would be widened to eight lanes, 
Las Virgenes Road to 10 lanes and the Ventura Freeway will need two more lanes 
in each direction. I have not met anyone who welcomes this level of 
development. Yet, according to the EIR, a vote for Jordan Ranch is a vote for 
this level of development. You can't have one without the other. 
</P>
<P>
I personally would love for there to be as many beautiful houses built in our 
precious area as there is room. I would love to have a PGA-level golf course 
just around the corner. I would love the prestige of the national broadcast of 
a golf tournament announcing it is "live from Agoura." Unfortunately, as I 
learned in Santa Monica, you can't have everything. I found an acceptable 
alternative and so will the interested parties in the Jordan Ranch land. I urge 
that the Jordan Ranch be developed only according to its present zoning. I am 
not ready for an eight-lane Kanan Highway.

TAX CHANGES WILL NET SOME HAPPY RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just as retailers are coping with gift returns, it is time for most individuals 
to start dealing with returns of another kind: tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
Starting this week, Americans will begin to receive their federal and state tax 
forms, signaling the beginning of the traditional tax filing season. And there 
are some changes that taxpayers should be aware of before they file their 1990 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Internal Revenue Service and California's Franchise Tax Board have 
altered their basic "short" forms -- the federal 1040A and California's 540A -- 
to allow elderly people with pension and retirement income to use the simpler 
return. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the 1040A and the 540A forms could not accommodate retirement 
income, so pensioners had to file the longer, more complex 1040 and 540 forms 
-- complete with schedules, itemized deductions and copies of other tax returns 
filed that year. But this year, both the federal and state governments added 
lines to include retirement income, deductions and credits that primarily 
affect the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
That should allow about 500,000 older Californians and about 4.5 million 
retirees nationwide to use the less-complex form. The catch: The forms are now 
just a touch more complex for everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't call it the short form any more because it's longer than last year," 
said Jim Reber, spokesman for the Franchise Tax Board in Sacramento. "We could 
have called it the longer-than-last-year's but-still-relatively-short form, but 
that seemed a little excessive." 
</P>
<P>
Reber said the California form is now about five lines longer. The federal form 
has a whole new schedule, said Jan Gribbon, an IRS spokeswoman in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Personal interest deductions have also fallen to 10% on federal tax returns. 
That means that the interest you pay on credit card debt and car and boat 
loans, among other things, is only 10% deductible for 1990 taxes. The 
deductions will be phased out completely next year. 
</P>
<P>
Other changes on the federal tax forms primarily have to do with indexing for 
inflation. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* The personal exemption -- the amount exempted from tax for you, your spouse 
and dependents -- increases to $2,050 per person from $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
* For those who do not itemize deductions, the standard deduction jumped for 
single taxpayers to $3,250 from $3,100 and to $5,450 from $5,200 for married 
couples. 
</P>
<P>
* Tax tables have also been indexed for inflation, so you can earn a bit more 
in 1990 without jumping into a higher tax bracket. 
</P>
<P>
* Those who use their cars for business and don't get reimbursed for gasoline 
expenses will find that the IRS has gotten a bit more generous here too. 
Previously the government allowed you to deduct 25.5 cents per mile for the 
first 15,000 miles and only 15 cents a mile for additional miles. Now the 
standard mileage rate is 26 cents and it applies to all mileage, no matter how 
far you go for business. 
</P>
<P>
Changes affecting Californians: 
</P>
<P>
* Senior citizens aged 62 and older, who now get the state's $58 tax credit, 
will have an extra box to check. This box allows them to give that $58 to 
finance political lobbying efforts, conduct meals-on-wheels programs and other 
senior-oriented organizations. The $58 is the taxpayers' money, however. (It is 
not like checking the box on your federal return that instructs the federal 
government to give $1 to finance political campaigns. In this case, if you 
give, it reduces your refund by $58.) 
</P>
<P>
* The Franchise Tax Board will also be assessing a bad check fee for the first 
time in its history. Starting Jan. 1, if your check to the board bounces, 
you'll be socked with a penalty amounting to $15, or 2% of the total tax owed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both state and federal tax authorities are urging individuals to 
take advantage of their automated filing programs. These programs allow 
taxpayers to file their returns via computer, which allows them to get their 
refunds more quickly. California authorities are guaranteeing a two-week 
turnaround time for automated filers, while federal officials say refunds would 
go out within three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Those who file paper returns generally have to wait between four and 10 weeks 
for refund checks. 
</P>
<P>
You generally must consult a tax adviser to fill out an automated return. 
However, some Volunteer Income Tax Assistance programs offer computerized 
filing. The VITA program provides free tax assistance to those who need it. 
Many colleges and community organizations sponsor the service. 
</P>
<P>
Notably, the tax filing season is starting a few days later than usual this 
year. The IRS said it got into the holiday spirit and asked the Post Office to 
delay sending out the forms until this Friday -- two days later than the 
typical mailing date the day after Christmas . 
</P>
<P>
"We were just trying to give people a breather between Christmas and getting 
their tax forms," Gribbon said.

EXISTING HOME SALES REBOUND 3% IN NOVEMBER; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: ANALYSTS CITE LOWER PRICES AND LOAN RATES, WHICH HAVE CREATED A 
BUYER'S MARKET, AS INSTRUMENTAL IN HALTING A TWO-MONTH SLIDE.

<P>
Buoyed by lower mortgage rates and cheaper prices, the nation's housing markets 
showed renewed life in November as sales of existing single-family homes rose 
nearly 3%, indicating that the worst may be over for the U.S. residential real 
estate slump, experts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The downward slide appears to be coming to an end," said Richard Peach, an 
economist for the Mortgage Bankers Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
After two months of steep declines, the sales pace of existing homes rose 2.95% 
in November compared to October, according to the latest monthly report from 
the National Assn. of Realtors, an industry trade group. 
</P>
<P>
The heightened sales pace comes as rates on fixed-rate mortgages have fallen 
well below 10% -- a percentage point below their level in August -- while the 
nationwide median price of an existing home has fallen to $91,300, 7% less than 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
"Buyers couldn't ask for better terms -- lower rates and lower prices," said 
Harley E. Rouda, president of the realtors group. "Home-buying conditions are 
the best we have seen in a decade." 
</P>
<P>
Economists caution, however, that the nation's housing market is still several 
months away from a true recovery, largely because consumer confidence remains 
fragile because of uncertainties about the economy and the prospects of war in 
the Middle East. A recovery won't begin until next spring at the earliest, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is moving along the bottom now," said David Berson, chief economist 
for the Federal National Mortgage Assn., also known as Fannie Mae. "We don't 
expect the market to go down much more, but a 3% rise is not statistically 
significant." 
</P>
<P>
The sales rate for existing single-family homes nationwide rose to 3.14 million 
in November, up from 3.05 million units in October. Those are seasonally 
adjusted numbers that indicate the number of homes that would be sold annually 
if the pace in October and November were to continue all year long. 
</P>
<P>
By region, the South and West showed sales increases in November, while the 
pace was unchanged in the Midwest and down slightly in the Northeast. Home 
sales in the West rose to 500,000 units from 490,000 in October, a rise of 2%. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Realtors predicts that 3.3 million existing single-family 
homes will be sold in 1990, off nearly 6% from 1989, while the national median 
price is expected to be $95,400, up 2.6% from last year. 
</P>
<P>
The sales pace in California, which accounts for most of the sales in the West, 
has quickened after running at its lowest levels in several years. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of existing single-family homes in California rose in November for the 
second-consecutive month, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual level of 
402,000, according to figures released last week by the California Assn. of 
Realtors. It was the first back-to-back monthly sales increase since February, 
the state group said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the median price of a house sold in California rose to 
$192,280 in November, a rise of more than 2% from October. 
</P>
<P>
"November's statewide median home price increase is a promising signal that the 
housing market may have stabilized," a California Assn. of Realtors official 
said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Still, few expect the markets -- national or local -- to improve much until the 
uncertainty in the Middle East is settled. The United Nations has set Jan. 15 
as the deadline for Iraqi troops to leave Kuwait, although a U.S.-led offensive 
against Iraq -- if one is necessary -- is not expected to begin until after 
Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people who are making major financial decisions -- and buying a house 
certainly qualifies as that -- are going to wait to see what happens in the 
Middle East," Berson said.

BOND PRICES SURGE ON MIDEAST NEWS, TREASURY AUCTION

<P>
A swirl of Persian Gulf developments and a robust $12.5-billion auction of 
Treasury notes sent long-term bond prices significantly higher Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 13/16 point, or $8.31 per $1,000 in 
face amount. Its yield was down to 8.28% from 8.35% late Monday. Markets were 
closed Tuesday for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Treasury's successful $12.5-billion auction of two-year 
notes, while adding an overall bullish tone to trading, may also have dampened 
demand in the secondary market's short-end. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on the auctioned two-year Treasury notes fell to 7.32%, their lowest 
level since two-year notes averaged 7.16% on Feb. 24, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market, short-term maturities were up 1/16 point to 3/16 
point, intermediate maturities rose 9/32 point to 15/32 point and long-term 
issues gained 9/16 point to 25/32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial 
information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a bond with a 
$1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
Overall trading was choppy and light, with many traders waiting to make a move 
until after New Year's. This made the market particularly vulnerable to the 
day's steady stream of Middle East developments. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are trying to get themselves a low profile for the year-end," 
said Jim Kenney, head trader at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Early in the day, the market backed off on news that the State Department asked 
all nonessential personnel and dependents of U.S. government workers to leave 
Jordan and Sudan before the Jan. 15 deadline that the United Nations has set 
for Iraq to withdraw or face the possibility of war. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department also recommended that U.S. citizens defer travel to the 
two countries, where the populations generally support Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Traders interpreted the development as heightening the prospect for a war in 
the Persian Gulf that could spark higher inflation. High inflation generally 
erodes the value of government securities such as bonds and notes. 
</P>
<P>
Prices rebounded on an Israeli newspaper report, later denied, that Washington 
and Baghdad had set a date for talks on an Iraqi withdrawal from occupied 
Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The independent daily Maariv, quoting Israeli diplomats in contact with 
American officials, said Secretary of State James A. Baker III probably will 
meet with Saddam Hussein in Baghdad on Jan. 9. The State Department said the 
report wasn't true. 
</P>
<P>
"There's one rumor after another," said Carol A. Stone, senior economist at 
Nomura Securities International Inc. "The rest of it has to do with the fact 
the recession gives the bond market a positive tone." 
</P>
<P>
The Lehman Bros. daily Treasury bond index, which measures price movements on 
all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 3.85 
to 1,181.30. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 6.66%, as the discount was down 6 
basis points to 6.47%. Yields on six-month bills were down to 6.86%, as the 
discount fell 7 basis points to 6.55%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 6.93%, 
as the discount was down 4 basis points to 6.51%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 7.5%, up from 7.0% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal 
bonds was unchanged from late Monday's 91 5/32 point. The average yield to 
maturity also was unchanged at 7.48%.

PENNZOIL UPS CHEVRON STAKE AFTER IRS ACTS;

ENERGY: IT NOW OWNS 9.4% OF THE OIL GIANT, SPENDING A TOTAL OF $2.1 BILLION OF 
ITS COURT SETTLEMENT WITH TEXACO.

Pennzoil Co. said Wednesday that it had increased its stake in Chevron Corp. 
after the Internal Revenue Service granted a five-month extension for Pennzoil 
to invest proceeds from its 1988 court settlement with Texaco Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Pennzoil spent $2.1 billion of a net $2.6-billion settlement in 1989 to 
purchase 31.5 million common shares of Chevron, giving it 9% ownership in the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, Pennzoil 
said that as of Wednesday it owned 32.8 million shares -- about 9.4% of the 
350.8 million shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Pennzoil said 1.27 million of those 32.8 million shares were purchased during 
the past 60 days on the New York Stock Exchange at an average price of $69.75 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
In July, Pennzoil notified the Federal Trade Commission of its intent to 
increase its ownership level to slightly under 10% by purchasing additional 
Chevron shares. 
</P>
<P>
Pennzoil said it needed the extension from the IRS because of delays in 
obtaining clearance from the FTC, which monitors business activity that is 
considered potentially anti-competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Under the IRS delay, Pennzoil said, the company now has until May 31 to invest 
proceeds from its historic 1988 Texaco litigation settlement.

New Offer Made for Hotel Investors: A group led by New York investor Leonard M. 
Ross, who has stalked Hotel Investors Trust for the past year, has made an 
offer to acquire the Los Angeles-based hotel owner and operator. The proposal 
by Ross, who owns 9.8% of the paired stock of Hotel Investors Trust and Hotels 
Investors Corp., calls for holders of the paired shares to receive $1.25 for 
each share, plus stock in a new company formed to hold Hotel Investors' Bourbon 
Street, King 8 and Gambling Hall Nevada hotels.

FTC Backs Networks: The Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Economics 
recommended that the Federal Communications Commission repeal the so-called 
financial interest and syndication rules that prohibit the three major TV 
networks from participating in the $3-billion program rerun business. Both the 
networks and the Hollywood studios and producers are engaged in last-minute 
lobbying campaigns before the FCC makes its decision early next year. The FTC's 
BOE joins other government agencies, such as the Justice Department and the 
Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information 
Administration, which previously stated that they favor lifting or relaxing the 
restrictions.

MOBIL, SOVIETS DISCUSS VENTURE WITH VIETNAM

Mobil Corp. is discussing the possibility of a three-way oil exploration and 
production venture with the Soviet Union in Vietnam, company officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The project would be Mobil's first exploration and production venture with 
Moscow, Mobil said. 
</P>
<P>
But due to a 15-year trade embargo that the United States has against Vietnam, 
the discussions remain at a preliminary stage, a Mobil spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"We must obey the laws of the land, and until they change, our discussions will 
not move far from preliminary levels," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The venture depends on whether the embargo remains in effect, said another 
Mobil spokesman, Ray Vaughan. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to do anything against the spirit or letter of the law," he 
said. "If the embargo is in effect, we won't be in the picture, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
While some companies have been lobbying in Washington for an end to the 
embargo, Mobil has not been one of them, Vaughan said, noting that Vietnamese 
officials first proposed the possibility of a joint project. 
</P>
<P>
One area that Mobil was interested in now is being produced by a 
Vietnamese-Soviet venture, Vietsovpetro. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil struck oil in the area, an offshore region off southern Vietnam in 1975, 
prior to the Communist victory.

COLA WAR IS HELPING RESCUE NATION'S SCHOOLS

Buy a soft drink, help a school. Budget's tight, call a cola company. 
</P>
<P>
That is the thinking behind the unusual partnership between the nation's 
leading beverage companies and many parents and principals. 
</P>
<P>
In Moodus, Conn., the entire town is collecting Pepsi caps to save the 
dilapidated Nathan Hale-Ray High School. In the first three weeks, children 
saved 20,000 caps. At a nickel apiece, the caps won't cover $9 million in 
expenses, but the fund-raising drive has raised hopes. The students have even 
suggested renaming the school "Pepsi-Cola High School." 
</P>
<P>
It's also good business for Pepsico Inc., Pepsi-Cola's parent company. Local 
stores have increased their orders; one pharmacy ordered 6,000 bottles, said 
teacher Adam Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
At Weymouth High School in Massachusetts, Pepsi and Coca-Cola are fighting over 
the chance to erect a new $5,000 scoreboard. Pepsi has warned it won't donate 
the board if the Coke vending machine remains in the school gym. Coke has made 
a counteroffer to provide a similar board. 
</P>
<P>
School officials, once hesitant to mingle educational purposes with commercial 
ventures, say tight fiscal times have made these partnerships more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
"I generally oppose endorsing products," said Francis Corbett, a school 
committee member. "But if we're going to make a pact with the devil, let's get 
the best deal we can." 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Secondary School Principals supports school-corporate 
partnerships if children aren't corrupted in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"They should not cross the line where they are using students for their own 
profit motives," said spokesman Lew Armistead. He said the association had 
objected to Channel One, a project of Knoxville, Tenn.-based Whittle 
Communications, which provides schools with special television news programming 
that is mixed in with advertising. 
</P>
<P>
The beverage makers, already renowned for innovative ways to reach consumers, 
have become more creative about reaching young buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Pepsi's "Be Excellent" video, a montage of pop stars and athletes preaching 
anti-drug and -alcohol themes, has been shown to 3 million students in 2,700 
high schools across the country this year, said spokesman Andrew Giangola. 
</P>
<P>
Students at Pinkston High in Dallas and Southwestern High School in Detroit are 
eligible for $2,000 in scholarships if they meet attendance, grade and 
drug-free goals. 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola donated $50,000 to the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Assn. 
to keep the state's high school basketball tournament afloat. 
</P>
<P>
The cola companies, maintaining they have always been dedicated to community 
service, say interest in the programs has jumped dramatically in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Schools are extremely cash-strapped and looking to corporate America to help 
out wherever possible," Giangola said. "This is a great example of how 
businesses can help schools and schools can help businesses." 
</P>
<P>
Pepsi usually requires schools to install its vending machines in return for 
scoreboards, computer equipment or cash bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola, according to one vice president, does not make such deals. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't hold anything over their head," said Donald Dowd, noting Coke 
sponsors high school athletic events, rewards athletes of the week and donates 
money to local boys and girls clubs. 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "We've been very fortunate, because of our activities, to get 
the endorsement of these schools. That's business." 
</P>
<P>
For Pepsi, "We're selling the product by virtue of the fact we have a vending 
machine on site," said Ken Kimmel, New England marketing director.

TAX AGENCIES OFFER ADVICE OVER THE PHONE

<P>
So you're in the middle of filing your tax return, and you're confused. Both 
the Internal Revenue Service and California's Franchise Tax Board offer 
toll-free numbers to answer taxpayer questions. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a touch-tone phone and your questions are relatively basic, 
government officials suggest you dial (800) TAX-4477 for the IRS, or (800) 
338-0505 if it's a question about your California tax return. 
</P>
<P>
With the touch of a few buttons, these numbers give you computerized recordings 
that answer basic questions regarding deductions, dependents and other commonly 
asked queries. They are less likely to be busy than the lines answered by human 
IRS and FTB agents, according to sources at both agencies. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't have a touch-tone phone -- or your question simply requires a 
human operator -- the IRS can be reached at (800) TAX-1040 and the Franchise 
Tax Board at (800) 852-5711. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS says its "peak" call-in times are on Mondays and Fridays. You're less 
likely to get a busy signal on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, said Jan 
Gribbon, an IRS spokeswoman in Los Angeles. Currently, the manned hot line is 
available between the 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., but the hours are frequently 
extended closer to April 15. 
</P>
<P>
The Franchise Tax Board's toll-free line is open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., and 
those calling before 10 a.m. or after 6 p.m. are much more likely to get 
through, said FTB spokesman Jim Reber. 
</P>
<P>
If you need tax forms or publications, call the IRS at (800) TAX-FORM and the 
state at (800) 338-0505. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there is good news on the accuracy front. Back in 1986, the General 
Accounting Office studied the answers given by IRS hot line operators and found 
they were only right 62.8% of the time. The following year, thanks to 
additional training and monitoring techniques, accuracy rose to 79.8% overall, 
the IRS says. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the agency is starting a pilot program to further boost accuracy. 
The program, which uses computerized prompts to get agents to ask necessary 
questions and arrive at the proper answer, was previously tested in Boston, 
where accuracy rose to almost 88%. KATHY M. KRISTOF

JAPANESE AGAIN BULLISH ON U.S. STOCKS; 
</P>
<P>
OUTLOOK: A RESEARCH FIRM SAYS THAT ALTHOUGH JAPAN'S ECONOMY WILL OUTPACE THE 
UNITED STATES' THROUGH '95, U.S. FIRMS WILL SHOW STRONGER PROFITS.

<P>
If you're looking for a place to invest in the 1990s, you might take notice 
that the Japanese are once again bullish on corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
So suggests a report from Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of Nomura 
Securities, the world's largest brokerage and securities firm. 
</P>
<P>
From it, smaller investors can glean tips on how a Japanese powerhouse research 
firm sees the new decade unfolding in global economic terms. 
</P>
<P>
Just when Americans are questioning whether their country is in decline, NRI 
expects companies here will post stronger earnings gains than their Japanese 
counterparts for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Because of that and other factors, it says that U.S. stocks are undervalued -- 
significantly so. What's more, it says companies here are more competitive than 
is widely believed -- thanks partly to healthy spending on research, sometimes 
to catch up with Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
"After we finished our research, we found potential in the U.S.," said Makoto 
Hiranuma, manager at NRI's U.S. affiliate, Nomura Research Institute America 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Nomura officials disclosed the report's major findings, although the full 
report will not be unveiled to investors in this country until February. 
</P>
<P>
NRI's analysts combed reams of data on U.S. and Japanese companies. And their 
basic conclusion was that while Japan's overall economic growth will double 
that of the United States in the years through 1995, U.S. companies are better 
positioned to show stronger earnings. NRI thinks that the growth of many 
Japanese companies has peaked. 
</P>
<P>
"We see a turning around in U.S. industry competitiveness since the mid-1980s," 
says Isao Yamamoto, a securities analyst at NRI. 
</P>
<P>
Through the first half of the decade, the research firm projects that the net 
earnings of 265 non-financial U.S. companies will grow an average of 13%, 
outpacing the 7% rate projected for 400 companies in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Among NRI's top picks: Compaq Computer Corp., Cadence Design Systems Inc., Eli 
Lilly &amp; Co., Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Dow Chemical 
Co., Toys R Us Inc., Merck &amp; Co. Inc. and Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
NRI analysts concluded that the painful restructurings that many big U.S. 
companies went through in the early and mid-1980s have paid off, leaving them 
better positioned for the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies are forging valuable links with outside firms instead of taking 
the go-it-alone approach of the past. NRI cites Compaq's ties with computer 
dealers, relationships it says have given the computer maker valuable 
information about customer needs. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, companies here have learned some lessons -- namely, that it pays 
to fashion a product to the needs and customs of foreign markets instead of 
thinking that what's good for the United States is good for everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
One example: Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s "Dosing Ball," which dispenses liquid 
detergent more evenly throughout the wash. The company developed the product 
for Europe, which is dominated by front-loading machines. Front-loaders 
generally work better with dry detergent but the ball has been well received, 
helping P&amp;G sell more liquid products. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese researchers also noted that the sheer size of the United States, 
with its 250 million people, gives companies such as discount retailer Wal-Mart 
and others room to build their sales and earnings. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is bigger. Your land is bigger," said Hiranuma. "Your population is 
twice as large as the Japanese population." 
</P>
<P>
It is not just Nomura that is bullish on America. Merrill Lynch chief 
investment strategist Charles Clough is, as well. 
</P>
<P>
"The big advantage that the U.S. is going to have is our interest rates are 
going to be lower, and our costs of manufacturing are going to be lower," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Clough reckons that a drop in private borrowing by consumers will allow 
domestic interest rates to fall. 
</P>
<P>
"If that happens, you're going to see a lot of investment flow here," he said, 
adding that more money is already flowing here from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
In one recent example, Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. agreed to buy 
entertainment giant MCA Inc. for $6.13 billion. The deal will be the biggest 
foreign takeover by a Japanese company. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nomura's Picks 
</P>
<P>
Nomura Research Institute, the research arm of the world's largest brokerage, 
Nomura Securities, has assembled a report that recommends investing in U.S. 
stocks. Following are the report's forecasts of the average annual earnings 
growth for five domestic companies for the years 1990-95:

EXPERTS URGE CAUTION IN HOME EQUITY LOANS; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: THE RATES ARE APPEALING, BUT SOME LOANS CALL FOR BALLOON PAYMENTS OR 
HAVE HIDDEN COSTS THAT COULD CAUSE AN OWNER TO LOSE THE PROPERTY.

<P>
Home equity loans have developed a fast following in these troubled economic 
times as more homeowners find themselves debt-ridden and cash-strapped. 
</P>
<P>
Loans based on home values can give consumers tens of thousands of dollars at 
relatively low interest rates. And unlike other loans, the interest in many 
cases is tax deductible. 
</P>
<P>
But experts warn that homeowners should exercise a great deal of caution before 
using their most valuable possession as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
"The house is the last major remaining asset folks have, and banks are all too 
willing to loan against the house because the loans are fully collateralized," 
said Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, a weekly newsletter based 
in North Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the appeal of home equity loans -- with interest rates hovering one 
to three percentage points above banks' prime rate -- should grow as rates 
continue to decline. The prime rate for most major banks stands at 10%, 
however, a few institutions recently lowered their rates to 9.75%. 
</P>
<P>
Rates remain much higher on unsecured bank loans. The average interest rate 
charged on a bank credit card was 18.83% in December, up from 18.60% at the 
start of the year, according to Bank Rate Monitor. The average rate for a bank 
personal loan was 17.34%, up from 17.19% in January, the publication said. 
</P>
<P>
For home equity loans, banks typically lend up to 80% of a home's appraised 
market value minus the amount owners owe on their mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
More than $50 billion was lent out through home equity lines of credit in 1989, 
and that figure is expected to grow 15% to 20% in 1990, according to the 
American Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their growing popularity, experts warn, these loans can contain many 
hidden costs that could run into hundreds of dollars, such as closing costs, 
application fees and appraisal fees. 
</P>
<P>
Also, if the prime rate rises, consumers with variable rates tied to the prime 
can be hit with a big jump in their monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly risky is a so-called balloon note -- a loan that calls for 
payments only on the interest for the first several years. After that, the 
borrower must cough up payments on a big principal. 
</P>
<P>
For those homeowners who don't need cash right away but want the flexibility of 
long-term loan access, the option of choice is taking out an extended line of 
credit against their home's value. 
</P>
<P>
However, a few banks penalize consumers who don't borrow money from the credit 
line, charging them an annual "non-usage" fee that can be about $50, Heady 
said.

COMMITTEE WILL IDENTIFY START OF RECESSION 
</P>

<P>
A panel of private economists, used by the government to decide whether the 
economy is officially in a recession, will probably pinpoint a month between 
June and September as the start of the current downturn, the group said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But the panel stopped short of identifying the exact start of a recession, 
saying it was still too early to tell. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears likely that the committee will identify a month between June and 
September, 1990, as the peak of activity in the economy and the onset of a 
recession," said the group. 
</P>
<P>
"However, because many data are still preliminary, the committee has not made a 
definite determination of the turning point," added the group, which is the 
government's official arbiter of peaks and troughs in the business cycle. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the panel of academic economists said output and employment in 
the United States were falling. 
</P>
<P>
But the committee will make a decision "only after the data show a sufficiently 
long and deep contraction that the episode would be termed a recession even if 
it were followed immediately by a strong upturn in the economy." 
</P>
<P>
The seven members of the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle 
Dating Committee conferred Friday by telephone, after several members said a 
recession had begun. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the panel agreed a recession had probably started, but they had not 
agreed on the exact month, said Victor Zarnowitz, emeritus professor of 
economics at the University of Chicago and a panel member. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is unlikely to confer again before the release of fourth-quarter 
gross national product figures Jan. 25, Zarnowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
The group defines recession as "a recurring period of decline in total output, 
income, employment and trade, usually lasting from six months to a year and 
marked by widespread contractions in many sectors of the economy." 
</P>
<P>
Economists say an official declaration of a recession might help focus the 
attention of financial market players and others on how to alleviate 
recessionary conditions. 
</P>
<P>
A generally accepted definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of 
shrinking gross national product.

JALISCO NATIVE HELPING OTHER IMMIGRANTS; 
</P>
<P>
CLUB: ORGANIZATION AIMS TO IMPROVE LIVES THROUGH BUSINESS LOANS AND EDUCATION.

SOUTH GATE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A South Gate businessman is spearheading a drive to provide help for an 
estimated 5,000 residents from Mexico's state of Jalisco, many of them poor and 
uneducated, who have immigrated to this city in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Arenas founded the Federacion de Clubes Jaliscienses to seek out adult 
education programs and business loans for Jalisco natives and other Latinos. At 
least 30% of the 4.5-million Mexican immigrants who live in Los Angeles County 
come from Jalisco, according to estimates by officials at the Mexican consulate 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Arenas, a Jalisco native, said he formed the club to provide opportunities for 
those who left the state. He also wants to change the image of Latinos as 
uneducated and not united. 
</P>
<P>
For Latinos to advance, they must first have an education, Arenas said. Some of 
the club's 200 members quit school after the third grade in Mexico and work on 
assembly lines and in service industries here. Only a few are small-business 
people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The majority came here poor and uneducated, Arenas said. In contrast, Arenas 
arrived with a college degree in architecture and the benefits of a 
middle-class background. Today he owns several businesses in the Southeast 
area, including a real estate company, a travel agency and an import-export 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Arenas said the organization he founded is a place for South Gate Latinos to 
congregate and learn about the services available to them. The city cannot meet 
all the needs of the sizable Latino community, which accounts for more than 73% 
of its population of 82,000. "It is another way to help the city and our people 
from Mexico," Arenas said. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Jose Gutierrez, the club's education director, agreed. "The idea is that 
clubs by region should have more of a civic-oriented purpose that goes beyond 
the organizing of social parties and the crowning of regional queens. There are 
more essential needs, (such as) education," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Club officials direct members to state and federally funded adult education 
programs, which are usually offered through public schools, community 
organizations and community colleges. The long-term goal is for members to 
become literate in their native language as well as in English, and involved 
with vocational training, Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
Much like other regional clubs, the organization also tries to maintain contact 
with the people of Jalisco. Recently some members drove a trailer of X-ray 
machines and beds to Jalisco and donated the equipment to a hospital there. 
</P>
<P>
State education officials confirm that Mexican immigrants in the last 20 years 
have tended to be from rural areas and have minimal education. Latinos, 
however, do not fare worse than other immigrant groups in educational level, 
said David Dolson, assistant manager of the bilingual office of the state 
Department of Education, adding that many immigrant groups come with little 
schooling. 
</P>
<P>
But club officials take little comfort in that knowledge. "Without education, 
Latinos are always going to be janitors and dishwashers, jobs where they don't 
need to speak the language," Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
The club also works with other Latino organizations such as the Mexican Chamber 
of Commerce of Los Angeles, which specializes in helping small-business 
enterprises, and the Willie C. Velasquez Center, which provides amnesty classes 
and education for immigrants.

ROTC UNDER ATTACK BY GAY ACTIVISTS AND FACULTY SENATE; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: ACTIVISTS WANT TO BAN THE CORPS AT CAL STATE LONG BEACH. BUT ARMY AND 
AIR FORCE OFFICERS SAY THEY ARE MERELY FOLLOWING FEDERAL POLICY.

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A squad of ROTC students at Cal State Long Beach spent a recent Tuesday 
preparing for war. 
</P>
<P>
They attended classes on military history and troop management, then stood at 
attention in a campus quad to hear announcements and salute their superiors. 
After marching in formation out to an athletic field, they performed a series 
of exercises, including push-ups and sit-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, however, the cadets and officials of the Reserve Officer Training Corps 
have been under verbal attack -- from an outspoken group of students and 
professors who want the program banned from campus because it discriminates 
against homosexuals, a violation of university policy. 
</P>
<P>
One of the critics, Jack Munsee, a physics professor, recently persuaded the 
campus Academic Senate, an advisory group of elected faculty representatives, 
to initiate proceedings that could eventually result in the program's ouster. 
</P>
<P>
"I never want it said of me that I was silent over this injustice," Munsee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
ROTC officials, most of whom are in the military, say they are following 
Defense Department rules banning gays from military service. Homosexual 
students are allowed to take ROTC classes for academic credit at Cal State Long 
Beach and most other colleges, but they are not eligible for the $100-per-month 
stipend that most upper-division participants receive. They also are not 
allowed to become regular cadets their third year, the time when most 
participants promise to become military officers upon graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"We serve two masters, a civilian boss on campus and a military boss in 
(Washington)," said Lt. Col. Andrew Peterson, a professor of military science 
and director of the university's Army ROTC. "What we have here is a conflict 
between the Department of Defense and the university, with the ROTC in the 
middle." 
</P>
<P>
But he made it clear which master has more clout. "I have to enforce government 
policy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
ROTC students and administrators said their program provides a valuable service 
and ought to be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson pointed out that ROTC contributes a stream of liberally educated 
officers with roots in civilian life. ROTC students and administrators also 
argue that an ROTC ban would discriminate against students who depend on the 
program for scholarships and to pave the way for a military career. Many of 
these students are minorities, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The ROTC controversy first erupted at Cal State Northridge, then spread to 
other California State University campuses. 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Northridge Faculty Senate voted to eliminate the ROTC program 
there because of its adherence to the Defense Department's anti-gay policy. 
Northridge President James W. Cleary eventually rejected the recommendation, 
citing an opinion by university lawyers that there was no legal basis for doing 
away with ROTC. 
</P>
<P>
Cleary wrote that, while he personally found the anti-homosexual policy 
"deplorable" and worthy of abolition, "banning an academic program simply 
because we are in disagreement with a policy of a profession which is serviced 
by this program is antithetical to the nature of an open university." 
</P>
<P>
The issue then was taken up by the state Academic Senate, consisting of faculty 
representatives from all 19 California State University campuses. The group 
adopted a resolution condemning the Defense Department and urged faculties of 
each campus to begin taking steps to remove ROTC if the department policy is 
not rescinded by Jan. 1. Local ROTC officials say they have received no 
indication the department plans to change its policy. 
</P>
<P>
Faculty groups at Cal State Hayward, Cal State Pomona and Cal State Bakersfield 
have also passed anti-ROTC resolutions. One private institution, Pitzer College 
in Claremont, banned ROTC earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, each university president will decide ROTC's fate. 
</P>
<P>
Campus officer training programs throughout the country were attacked in the 
late 1960s and early 1970s by opponents of the Vietnam War. Some programs were 
closed, and others experienced dwindling enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
The first ROTC programs were established only six years ago at Cal State Long 
Beach, however. About 150 students participate in Army and Air Force ROTC 
programs on campus. 
</P>
<P>
Physics professor Munsee led the ROTC protest, and found support among members 
of the campus Gay and Lesbian Student Union, who cited studies that they said 
indicate that the presence of homosexuals in the military would not hamper 
national defense. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as there is discrimination going on for one person or small group of 
people, then it's possible for discrimination to go on against others," said 
Heather Haskell, the organization's treasurer. "We should fight discrimination 
on all levels." 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, after a spirited debate, the campus Academic Senate approved 
the resolution endorsing the state faculty's position and initiating the 
procedure for discontinuing ROTC. 
</P>
<P>
In accordance with university procedure, the group voted to form a committee to 
hold hearings on the issue and submit a report next fall to university 
president Curtis L. McCray, who will make the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
McCray says he has an open mind on the subject. "We are attempting to give 
everybody an equal shake and if any of our programs, either directly or de 
facto, have impact on students because of their differences, then (those 
programs) have to be looked at." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the ROTC students continue their program. While many say that 
they would have no personal qualms about serving on military duty with open 
homosexuals, opinion is somewhat divided on whether the government's anti-gay 
policy ought to be changed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they're a legitimate minority," said Joe Ingram, a 26-year-old 
political science major in the last semester of the four-year program. "These 
people have chosen to be a minority and therefore shouldn't receive the kind of 
benefits that legitimate minorities receive." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Pantano, a 28-year-old fine arts major who already has been commissioned 
as an Army lieutenant, disagrees. "Personally, I don't think sexual orientation 
should have anything to do with it," she said. "There are already a lot of 
slime-ball heterosexuals in the service." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the cadets acknowledge, however, that they are a bit concerned about 
ROTC's uncertain future on campus. 
</P>
<P>
"If worse comes to worse," said Joselito Sto Thomas, 28, "we'll just go to UCLA 
and drill over there. (But) that would be a major hassle."

MALL FACE LIFTS SEEN AS KEY TO KEEPING RETAIL SALES UP; 
</P>
<P>
SHOPPING: THE SOUTHEAST MARKETING AREA ALREADY HAS 10 MAJOR MALLS FROM LONG 
BEACH TO MONTEBELLO. RATHER THAN BUILD MORE, CITIES ARE LOOKING TO UPDATE 
EXISTING ONES TO STAY COMPETITIVE.

<P>
Three years ago, Downey city officials took a hard look at their largest retail 
area, the Stonewood Shopping Center, and concluded that it was sliding 
dangerously close to economic senility. Downey residents were leaving town to 
do their shopping. 
</P>
<P>
"What we saw was that Stonewood would continue to decline unless we did 
something to reverse the trend," said Kenneth Farfsing, assistant city manager 
in charge of redevelopment. "We felt we needed to do something dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
With a new owner already talking of renovation, the city decided to nudge him 
into action with a deal: For 12 years after the remodeling, the city would 
split its share of increased sales tax revenue with the developer. The city 
also agreed to improve surrounding streets. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Stonewood is like a new mall. Completely enclosed, the once open-air 
shopping center has a new anchor, the May Co., and a host of new restaurants 
edging its parking lot. When the remodeling is completed, the mall will have 
161 new stores, more than double its original number. 
</P>
<P>
Southeast-area shoppers are bound to see more of such reincarnations. In an 
area that already has 10 major shopping centers from Long Beach to Montebello 
and relatively little open space for new malls, the renovation of existing 
shopping complexes is the likely look of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, the area is saturated with malls and really couldn't support 
another one," said Skip Keyzers, senior vice president of MaceRich Corp., which 
owns the highly successful Lakewood Center Mall. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Norton, Stonewood's general manager, commented, "There are only so many 
people within a market. You can only split the market so many times." 
</P>
<P>
Of the county's major shopping centers, some of the most and least successful 
are in the Southeast. Yet at both extremes, refurbishment is being discussed -- 
either to invigorate sales at such aging, badly designed centers as Paddison 
Square in Norwalk, or to maintain the cash flow at such well-established malls 
as Los Cerritos Center. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see us really consider some revitalization," said Cerritos 
Mayor Ann B. Joynt, who thinks the 20-year-old regional mall could use a 
trendier look, a new parking structure, and perhaps a second story of shops. 
</P>
<P>
As Southeast malls get their midlife face lifts, Westside swank is still not 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos officials were thinking of further bolstering their already 
substantial sales tax base with construction of an upscale mall in Towne 
Center, the last major vacant tract in the city. But after studying the 
demographics and income level of the area, a private consultant concluded that 
there simply was not a market for such high-end stores as Saks Fifth Avenue and 
Neiman Marcus. 
</P>
<P>
Largely working class and middle class, Southeast is the land of Mervyn's, 
Broadway and May Co. 
</P>
<P>
If there is an empty shopping niche waiting to be filled, it is for membership 
warehouse stores such as Price Club and so-called "power centers," which are 
devoted to anchors selling a single category of goods, such as Home Depot, the 
building supply store. 
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that, Long Beach city officials are now courting developers to 
build a power center on a former oil drilling tract near the San Diego Freeway 
where the city had once envisioned an auto mall. 
</P>
<P>
In the era of sluggish property tax growth that followed Proposition 13's 
restrictions on increasing property levies, city officials have viewed shopping 
malls with the same covetous eyes as auto malls. They wooed shopping center 
developers with redevelopment deals, discounting the price of land for them and 
building roads. And officials watch sales as if they were shopkeepers. 
</P>
<P>
Without a really successful major mall in the city, Long Beach has long fretted 
over the way its shoppers go out of town to Lakewood and Cerritos to spend 
their money. Redevelopment officials are talking of helping Los Altos owners 
spruce up their drab, 25-year-old shopping center in eastern Long Beach, and 
the city is also talking to potential buyers of the downtown Long Beach Plaza, 
again hoping for a remodeling to boost sales. 
</P>
<P>
As the area's big shopping areas struggle to improve their market share or 
maintain it, they may well face hard times. 
</P>
<P>
"All forecasts -- and I'm totally in agreement -- are that in the next 10-year 
period there will be a great shake-out in retailing all over the country," 
observed Tracey Hall, president of The Hall Olson Marketing Group in Newport 
Beach. "California is no exception." 
</P>
<P>
Too much retail development, not all of it wise, has left the nation with more 
than it can handle, say national analysts, some of whom have predicted that as 
many as half the country's retailers will fail over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the recent conversion of Old Towne Mall in Torrance to a smaller 
strip center, Hall said some malls may actually decrease their size to make 
more profitable use of their space. Indeed, developers are shrinking the 
15-year-old La Mirada Mall from an unwieldy 135-store complex that covered 75 
acres to a 35-store shopping center covering about half the area. 
</P>
<P>
RETAIL SALES

Taxable retail sales reported in 1989 by each of the major shopping centers in 
Long Beach and Southeastern Los Angeles, and how that figure ranked among the 
county's 45 largest malls:

Every two weeks, Beverly Brafford jumps into her Cadillac Allante and heads to 
the mall -- 30 miles from her San Gabriel Valley home. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes 35 to 40 minutes . . . but it's worth the travel," Brafford, of West 
Covina, said of her jaunts to the stylish and expensive South Coast Plaza in 
Costa Mesa. "They have more selections, better stores . . . better quality." 
</P>
<P>
For another San Gabriel Valley resident, Onnie Oriente, low prices are the 
object. But Oriente, 22, of Rowland Heights, also finds herself heading outside 
the region for shopping. 
</P>
<P>
"The prices here are outrageous," she said, window-shopping recently at City of 
Industry's Puente Hills Mall, where she gets fashion ideas before doing her 
real shopping at a discount Contempo outlet about 35 miles away in San 
Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
Retailing consultants believe there is a moral to this tale of two mall 
shoppers. They say the vast San Gabriel Valley -- encompassing 29 cities and 
spanning 250 square miles from Pasadena to Pomona -- is home to a number of 
undistinguished shopping centers out of step with their rapidly changing 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say residents have nowhere to spend their money. In West Covina, 
there's The Plaza, newly revamped with a glistening food court and skylights. 
In Arcadia, there's Santa Anita Fashion Park -- giant sandcastle, man-made 
waterfall and all. There's Plaza Pasadena. Puente Hills Mall. Eastland Shopping 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
And as proof of the viability of malls in the San Gabriel Valley, executives 
say sales this year have increased in spite of the weakening economy and a soft 
retail market. 
</P>
<P>
Yet some of Southern California's biggest, most successful, and thus most 
recession-proof shopping malls lie just outside the region -- the Glendale 
Galleria, for example, and Montclair Plaza in rapidly developing San Bernardino 
County -- both close enough so that travel time for valley residents is 
minimized. 
</P>
<P>
These mega-malls suck tax dollars out of the region, making it difficult for 
cities such as Pasadena and Arcadia to lure new department stores -- such as 
Nordstrom -- to their own less glamorous mid-sized malls. 
</P>
<P>
"There is tremendous leakage from the valley," said Alex Espalin, a management 
consultant for the accounting firm Peat Marwick Main &amp; Co.'s real estate 
group. "People are spending their money outside of the valley." 
</P>
<P>
As super-regional malls grew even larger and racked up profits throughout the 
1980s, their mid-sized counterparts, anticipating an exodus of local shoppers, 
rushed to play catch-up. 
</P>
<P>
West Covina Fashion Plaza spent $17 million to elevate its roof, install 
skylights, add a food court and change its name to The Plaza at West Covina. 
Santa Anita Fashion Park, meanwhile, hauled in several cubic tons of dirt for a 
sand sculpture project. Puente Hills Mall added escalators in its four courts, 
and will replace its fountain with a carousel. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to measure the amount of business the Galleria and Montclair 
Plaza steal from malls within the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But sales figures show that, without a doubt, no shopping center in the San 
Gabriel Valley comes close to those two malls. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Galleria stores rang up almost $383 million in sales, the 
second-highest total in Los Angeles County, behind Del Amo Fashion Center in 
Torrance. Montclair Plaza sold almost $332 million worth of merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Puente Hills Mall, which is larger than Montclair Plaza, 
sold only about $179 million. Santa Anita Fashion Park in Arcadia, often called 
one of the San Gabriel Valley's better malls, did even worse, with 1989 sales 
of almost $155 million. 
</P>
<P>
when sales are measured by square footage, to take into account vast 
differences in mall sizes, Montclair Plaza and the Galleria dwarf all the 
others. Montebello Town Center -- which also draws heavily from the San Gabriel 
Valley, does fairly well in sales per foot. 
</P>
<P>
Why the spending vacuum in one of Los Angeles County's most heavily populated 
areas? Experts in the retail industry have a variety of explanations, some of 
them contradictory, for why many San Gabriel Valley shoppers tend to shun their 
hometown malls. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Giss, a retail consultant at the accounting firm Deloitte &amp; Touche 
and a resident of San Marino, sums up the San Gabriel Valley's shopping mall 
problem in two sentences: 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and others from San Marino go to South Coast Plaza for the whole 
weekend," Giss said. "They get a hotel, stay one night, shop two days." 
</P>
<P>
For top-of-the-line shoppers in the San Gabriel Valley's wealthy pockets, local 
malls just don't cut it, Giss said. Closer to home, Santa Anita Fashion Park in 
Arcadia, he said, is "dependable, but not exciting," and he called the Plaza 
Pasadena a "trinket" mall. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, San Gabriel Valley retailers are in a bind because there are not 
enough well-to-do shoppers here to support a South Coast Plaza or a Beverly 
Center on their home turf, Giss said. 
</P>
<P>
But Espalin of Peat Marwick, who lives in Glendora, says the San Gabriel Valley 
has enough high-end, mainstream merchandise. What it really needs, he contends, 
are more shopping centers catering to the diverse Latino and Asian immigrant 
communities -- a marketing reality that Espalin says mall developers and 
merchants have been slow to respond to. 
</P>
<P>
"The Polo by Ralph Lauren shirts aren't going to fare as well," he said. "It 
seems like that's something retailers take for granted, in that they just take 
a proven retail product and just set up shop without taking the local market 
into account. Nowadays with Hispanics and Asians, there are different factors 
altogether." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Espalin said, the only way shopping malls have responded to changing 
demographics is in "ethnicizing" their food stands. 
</P>
<P>
However, it will be hard for developers to do much more, he said, given the 
current economic slump and some developers' negative image of the San Gabriel 
Valley -- that it is polluted, has more crime than areas such as the Inland 
Empire, and is home to many low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the standard, enclosed shopping mall filled with rows of chain stores 
and organ showrooms just isn't what the San Gabriel Valley needs, said Rocky 
Tarantello, a USC land economics professor who also runs a Newport Beach-based 
real estate consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed to thriving commercial districts -- Los Angeles' Koreatown and El 
Monte's Latino commercial district -- as examples of open-air successes 
reflecting the needs of their surrounding communities. "You might not like 
them; you might not think they're cosmetically appealing, but the fact remains 
that they're doing well."

PICO RIVERA PLAZA GIVES REDEVELOPMENT A BOOST

Pico Rivera Plaza was the city's first major shopping center, built after the 
local Redevelopment Agency bought and razed a ragtag collection of small 
businesses and homes on a 23-acre patch of land at the corner of Whittier and 
Rosemead boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
It marked the beginning of this small city's efforts to spruce up a commercial 
area described by local officials as "junk" and "dismal." And while it ranks 
near the bottom of the county's list of malls in terms of total retail sales, 
the plaza was considered enough of a success that developers have since built 
the slightly smaller Crossroads Plaza across the street and some strip centers 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a proven success for the Redevelopment Agency and has stimulated 
further retail development along Whittier Boulevard," said David A. Caretto, 
Pico Rivera's assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Owned by Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., Pico Rivera Plaza is a neatly 
maintained outdoor complex of red tile roofs and rough stucco. It was remodeled 
about three years ago, and a landscaped plaza area was added. The area includes 
a brick stage for community events such as Cinco de Mayo celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
It is an unpretentious neighborhood center catering to local residents, who 
have an estimated average household income of $34,500. There is the usual 
assortment of inexpensive chain stores such as Montgomery Ward and Thom McAn 
Shoe, along with small, independently owned places such as a Mexican restaurant 
and a video shop, where they will give you a personal critique of the movie you 
are renting. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the closeness of Crossroads, which has a Home Depot and Albertson's, 
city officials say the mix of stores is different enough so that the new mall 
has not hurt sales at the city's senior shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
"The shoppers are different and they come for different things," Caretto said.

ISOLATED WHITTWOOD SERVES A 'CAPTIVE,' LOYAL CLIENTELE 
</P>

<P>
At first glance, the 32-year-old Whittwood Mall seems to be saddled with 
several ingredients that spell doom. 
</P>
<P>
It is five miles from the 605 Freeway via traffic-clogged Whittier Boulevard, 
and four miles from the Santa Ana Freeway (I-5). When shoppers finally arrive 
on Whittier Boulevard, the main traffic artery through the heart of the area, 
they are greeted by the mall's unattractive backside. 
</P>
<P>
But Whittwood's isolation is a mixed blessing. 
</P>
<P>
Whittwood's management acknowledges that the mall is not luring legions of 
shoppers from the freeways. At the same time, however, the limited access to 
freeways in the Whittier-La Habra area means that local shoppers are not likely 
to abandon the mall, with its dowdy exterior, run-of-the-mill stores and 
makeshift food court, for more attractive shopping centers elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get in here, but, at the same time, you can't get out either," mall 
manager Diane Acosta said. "So, we have a real loyal customer base." 
</P>
<P>
"You're trapped," said Hank C. Cunningham, Whittier's assistant city manager in 
charge of economic development. "It's a captive audience." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the mall remains an integral part of the city's economy, 
demonstrating a staying power that helps explain why it has four anchor stores 
-- JC Penney, Mervyn's, Broadway and the Boston Store. Last year, Whittwood 
Mall's 88 stores, restaurants and service centers generated almost $1 million 
in sales tax revenue for Whittier -- accounting for 13% of the city's sales tax 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham points out that there are 400,000 people within the mall's five-mile 
trade area and that the median family income in that area is more than $43,000, 
well above the Los Angeles County median income of $30,214. "It's a fairly 
affluent area," Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
The income levels and the land-locked clientele also help explain why an 
executive with a national mall development company said his firm tried 
unsuccessfully to buy Whittwood several years ago. With some sprucing up and 
aggressive retail strategies, Whittwood could increase its sales volume 50% to 
100%, said the executive, who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
And Whittwood is sprucing up. Its owner, the Lusk Co. of Irvine, which built 
the mall in 1958, plans to give it a face lift, new signs and a refurbished 
entrance during the next few months, Acosta said. New restaurants are sprouting 
around the periphery of the mall, which takes up the large city block between 
Santa Gertrudes and Scott avenues. 
</P>
<P>
A 10-screen theater, the first multiscreen movie house in the city, opened at 
the mall Thanksgiving weekend. "Initial indications are that the theaters are 
doing very well . . . and (they are) real important in keeping people in town," 
Cunningham said.

LAKEWOOD MALL LEADS WITH MOST STORES, HIGHEST SALES

<P>
Sprawled over 170 acres at the intersection of Lakewood and Del Amo boulevards, 
the Lakewood Center Mall was created out of a bean field as part of the first 
planned community in California. 
</P>
<P>
The center was built in 1951, three years before the city of Lakewood was 
incorporated and a couple of decades before nine other major regional shopping 
centers were firmly established in the Southeast area. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Lakewood is still the acknowledged king of area shopping centers, with 
245 retail and service outlets that sell everything from tans to diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
You can ride a vintage carousel in the middle of the center's enclosed mall, 
see a movie on one of seven screens, pick up your dry cleaning, cash a check at 
one of five banks, or make plane reservations at a travel agency. 
</P>
<P>
One of the newest retail businesses, Freeze Frame, will dress you up in clothes 
and jewelry, put on your makeup, and take a glamorous picture. A medical 
clinic, operated by Doctors Hospital of Lakewood, offers free screening for 
heart disease, high cholesterol, or breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
A Nintendo sales outlet's performance attests to the volume of shoppers that 
traipse through the Lakewood center. The outlet, located in a 10-by-20-foot 
kiosk in one of the mall's aisles, generated "in excess of $1 million" in sales 
last year, more than $5,000 per square foot, according to manager Mike Keya. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the center last year generated $350 million in sales, the third 
highest of the top 45 malls and shopping centers in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
With 2.4 million square feet of retail space, Lakewood was for many years 
listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest shopping mall in 
the world. A 5.2-million-square-foot mall in Alberta, Canada, now holds the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakewood Park Corp. set aside space for the sprawling shopping area in 1948 
when it bought up vast agricultural fields in the area and began building the 
thousands of small tract homes that sold then for about $6,000. Those homes 
today make up the city of Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
After most of the houses were built, the developers turned their attention to 
building the shopping center, which remains today the city's only downtown. 
</P>
<P>
As the commercial and entertainment center of the city, the shopping mall 
accounted for 48% of Lakewood's sales tax revenue last year. The city's 
economic health is so closely tied to sales volumes at the center that city 
officials, heeding warnings of a recession and a decline in consumer spending, 
are talking about readjusting their budget halfway through this fiscal year. 
Officials have drawn up a list of capital improvements to put on hold if the 
center's Christmas sales tax revenues drop. 
</P>
<P>
The sprawling center, which spills across one city street, does not have the 
impressive dollar-per-square-foot sales records of newer malls that feature two 
or three stories. Many commercial and service buildings at Lakewood are 
detached from the main mall. 
</P>
<P>
But the developer seeks to overcome the inefficient layout with a marketing 
strategy that calls for adapting quickly to changing retail trends. 
</P>
<P>
MaceRich Corp. of Santa Monica bought the center from the original developer in 
1975 and enclosed the mall portion in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
At the time the mall changed hands, 35% of the outlets were shoe stores, said 
Chuck Ebner, the city's chief urban planner. "That (didn't) make a lot of 
sense, so, what they have done is make sure there are theaters and a good mix 
of merchants in there." 
</P>
<P>
Skip Keyzers, senior vice president of MaceRich, points to the Circuit City 
outlet near the southeast corner of the mall as an example of how Lakewood has 
changed over the years. The building first housed a bowling alley, then, for 
several years, was occupied by the discount Akron store. Circuit City moved in 
when the Akron chain went out of business. 
</P>
<P>
Keyzers also points to the highly successful Nintendo kiosk as an example of 
how quickly retailing tastes can change. "Three years ago it wasn't even here 
and in two years it may be gone," he said. 
</P>

CERRITOS CENTER LURES SHOPPERS WITH LOCATION

It does not have architectural amenities that distinguish newer malls, such as 
a food court or a glass ceiling to let in light. It is cave-like and its 
one-story, S-shaped design turns a walk from one end to the other into a hike. 
</P>
<P>
Outside, the parking lot is crowded and on heavy shopping days the surrounding 
streets are jammed with cars streaming off the adjacent 605 Freeway for the 
mall and the surrounding commercial area. 
</P>
<P>
Still, they keep coming to Los Cerritos Center -- roughly 5 million people this 
year -- making it one of the most profitable malls in the Southland. In terms 
of taxable retail sales, Los Cerritos ranks seventh among the 70 largest malls 
in Southern California. It generated $2.8 million in sales tax revenue last 
year for the city of Cerritos, 21% of the city's total sales tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the crowd at Los Cerritos Center is drawn there by its location just 
off the San Gabriel River Freeway, and the sheer size of the mall -- 159 
stores, including five anchors. Only Lakewood Shopping Center, with six anchor 
stores, has more than Los Cerritos in the Southeast area. But the Cerritos 
center can boast of the only upscale Nordstrom and Robinson's outlets in the 
Southeast area. 
</P>
<P>
"What the center does offer here is the wide range of department stores from 
Mervyn's to Nordstrom," said Kelly Keahey, who manages the mall for its owner, 
the Hahn Co. "We offer every type of department store to meet our market," 
Keahey said. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers are also drawn to the mall by the surrounding three blocks of 
commercial development. When Cerritos became a city nearly 25 years ago, 
officials set aside much of its vacant dairy land for commercial uses they knew 
would generate hefty sales tax revenue. Then, making extensive use of state 
redevelopment laws that allowed them to give tax breaks to developers, the city 
covered much of its vacant land with retail businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is not part of the mall, there is an extensive restaurant row a 
street away. Fedco and Toys R Us are among the big stores that border the mall 
on two other sides, and the city's auto mall, one of the largest in the nation, 
is just an overpass away on the other side of the 605 Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Inside Los Cerritos Center, shoppers can see a movie, buy Lotto tickets, browse 
at the Hatfield Diamond Corner and get up to $5,000 in credit, munch French 
fries at a Burger King, listen to music at the Organ Exchange, and rent a 
wheelchair for a weary grandparent. During the Christmas season, shoppers also 
could leave their kids at a child-care booth for $2 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the stores cater to middle-income buyers, although some upper-scale 
specialty stores can be found. 
</P>
<P>
With so many people packed into its windowless corridors, Los Cerritos does not 
miss a chance to turn a profit. There are street-level billboard signs for rent 
and dozens of peddler carts displaying everything from candy to baseball cards. 
</P>
<P>
Los Cerritos Center was built 20 years ago, which accounts for much of its 
seemingly outdated architecture. The mall owners might consider renovations, 
such as a food court, Keahey said.

COACH OF WOMEN'S BASKETBALL STARTS AT BOTTOM WITH BASICS; 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS: LOUIE NELSON WAS AN ALL-AMERICAN IN COLLEGE AND A SIX-YEAR PRO IN THE 
NBA. HE WAS USED TO WINNING. BUT COACHING AT HARBOR COLLEGE HAS BEEN A NEW 
EXPERIENCE.

<P>
Louie Nelson paced the sidelines, yelling, clearly frustrated as he watched one 
of his basketball players shoot yet another air ball. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen minutes into the second half, Nelson's Harbor College women's team 
trailed, 78-20, and all the first-year coach could do was rest his cheek on the 
palm of his hand and swallow his emotions. 
</P>
<P>
One of Nelson's assistants, Andre Breland, sat at the end of the bench, head 
down, arms crossed. Occasionally he looked up, only to shake his head in 
disillusionment. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson did not give up, though. He continued calling plays and screaming out 
the basic fundamentals of a game he played professionally and loves 
passionately. 
</P>
<P>
"Stay in the line! Stay in the line! Now get your hands up -- you're playing 
defense! That's it. That's it." 
</P>
<P>
And in those rare moments when a Harbor player scored or executed the basic 
zone defense correctly, Nelson clapped enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care if we lose by 100; all I ask is that you play hard and play 
together," he said. "As you can see, we don't have the talent that other teams 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Harbor lost that game, its seventh loss in a row, to visiting Saddleback 
College, 95-29. 
</P>
<P>
In more than 20 years as a coach and player, Nelson had never been whipped so 
badly. He played for winning programs at Compton High School and the University 
of Washington, and later in the National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
That success carried over into his coaching career, which began in 1982 when he 
was an assistant coach of the men's team at Cal State Los Angeles. In 1989 he 
led the Compton High boys to the semifinals of the state playoffs, and last 
season he helped the Ganesha High boys reach the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Losing was a foreign concept for Nelson until he took over the Harbor College 
women's program in mid-September as a favor to an old friend, Harbor men's 
basketball Coach Ken Curry. 
</P>
<P>
Curry made the request because the community college was in a bind. Harbor 
Athletic Director Jim O'Brien had reinstated women's basketball after a 10-year 
hiatus, but classes had begun and he had no coach. O'Brien said Lynwood High 
girls' Coach Maurice Roberson made a verbal commitment last spring to coach the 
team but bailed out at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
In came Louie Nelson, a high-strung and controversial man who is used to 
winning and had never coached women before. 
</P>
<P>
At Compton High, Nelson was suspended for 10 days because one of his players 
accused him of knocking him unconscious in a post-game locker-room scuffle. 
Nelson, who denies the incident, was reinstated but quit after one season 
because of "a difference in coaching philosophy between the principal and me." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, 39, says his vehement style of coaching is often misinterpreted. Away 
from the game, he is a patient and easygoing guy, but on the court he seems 
possessed. 
</P>
<P>
"I am an intense coach," Nelson said. "I love the game and I love to win, so I 
make my players intense. People take it the wrong way, and sometimes players 
think I'm getting down on them, but I'm just making them better." 
</P>
<P>
The slender 6-foot-3 coach rubbed his neatly trimmed beard as he recalled his 
initial reaction to Curry's offer: 
</P>
<P>
"No way! I said there is no way I am taking that job." 
</P>
<P>
That was understandable, because classes had started and there was no time for 
recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson posted colorful signs throughout the Wilmington campus in an effort to 
attract players. Seventeen women tried out, and 14 are still on the team. Most 
of them had never played basketball before. Some had been inactive for several 
years after mediocre high school careers. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the Seahawks are averaging 46 points a game. Recently they beat two 
weak teams (Glendale College twice and an Air Force club team once), making 
them 3-8. It is unlikely, however, that Harbor will win another game this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"(Nelson) started from scratch," O'Brien said. "He tried to find anybody that 
could dribble the ball. He's got girls out there that are still learning about 
the game, and he's doing a great job teaching them. 
</P>
<P>
"Lets face it: I'm not so sure I could do what he's doing. Everybody has an 
ego, and everybody wants to win," said O'Brien, who led Harbor's baseball team 
to three state titles and 10 conference championships in 14 years as coach. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who lives in Montclair, said: "I guess I'm a sucker for a challenge. 
Anybody in his right mind wouldn't have taken the job." 
</P>
<P>
Now he does more instructing than coaching. Nelson has taught algebra in the 
Los Angeles Unified School District for seven years, but he has never really 
taught basketball. The players he had at other schools were top-notch athletes 
with a strong command of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"(At Harbor,) I have to break the plays down to the simplest form, as they say 
in algebra. I had to teach them about three seconds in the key and how to 
dribble with balance. I even had to show them what a jump ball is," Nelson 
said. "They can play as long as I tell them where to go and what to do." 
</P>
<P>
His latest project is teaching his players how to run a press. 
</P>
<P>
"My ladies aren't that advanced yet," he said. "It was like a puzzle for them. 
We have to stick with the bare basics." 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback women's Coach Jack Single said he admires what Nelson is doing. 
After serving as a men's assistant, he started the women's program at the 
Mission Viejo college two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows they probably won't win a game in league," Single said. "It 
will be amazing if they can stick together." 
</P>
<P>
Starting at the bottom has not been easy for a guy like Nelson, who considers 
himself an expert on the game. He is a disciplinarian who likes a well-balanced 
offense and a tough defense. He thrives on winning. 
</P>
<P>
"He's learning patience with the girls," said Linda Kelly, a longtime friend of 
Nelson's and one of his assistants. "It's also been a big mental adjustment for 
him to lose. He's still high-strung and still intense and into the game, but 
he's learning to adjust to what he has here." 
</P>
<P>
After every two-hour practice in the gym, Nelson conducts drills on the 
concrete courts outside. He also has optional practice on Saturdays. His 
players say he is extremely dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
"We love him," said forward Mary Esene, who played basketball sparingly at 
Narbonne High. "He really cares about this team. He's tough on us and he works 
us hard because he knows we can do better." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson does not believe in giving up. He says he was conditioned to win as a 
kid growing up in Compton. To do that, he says, you must always give 100%. 
</P>
<P>
He was on two state champion basketball teams at Compton High. At the 
University of Washington, where he earned a degree in architecture, Nelson was 
named freshman of the year after leading the team in scoring and assists. As a 
senior he was an All-American. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Bullets picked Nelson in the first round of the NBA draft, and 
he spent the next six years as a point guard with Washington, New Orleans, 
Kansas City, San Antonio and New Jersey. At New Orleans, he was the back-court 
partner of Pete Maravich. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson still plays in recreation leagues, but coaching is where he spends most 
of his energy. Already he is recruiting local high school players who can help 
the Seahawks win more games next season. 
</P>
<P>
"I still take a loss very hard," he said, shaking his head. "I still can't 
sleep at night when we lose. I twist and turn all night." 
</P>
<P>
It sounds as if Nelson is going to have many sleepless nights until the middle 
of February.

ITS CHARM ABOUNDS, BUT SHOPPERS DON'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the ABC television series "The Wonder Years" sought a local mall for its 
Christmas episode, Eastland in West Covina was No. 1 on the shopping list. 
</P>
<P>
"It had the right feel for the period, the '60s and early '70s," publicist 
Leslie Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
There's the wide, brass-banistered staircase at the southeast entry, and stores 
on the north side with street entrances as well as openings into the mall. 
</P>
<P>
Period charm may be abundant, but customers are less so. Only a trickle 
traversed the main passage on a recent holiday shopping weeknight. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no good stores here that sell good quality clothes," complained Haydee 
Perez, 16, of Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
Eastland's glory has faded considerably since 1957, when the $57-million, 
58-acre development on former orchard land was the prime shopping center of the 
eastern San Gabriel and Pomona valleys. 
</P>
<P>
About 23% of the mall's 70 specialty store spaces are empty. May Co. will move 
down the road to West Covina's newer, larger, Plaza mall by fall, 1992. 
Mervyn's is the other anchor. Mall managers admit the shopping center's aging 
buildings need renovation. 
</P>
<P>
The mall's owner, May Centers Inc. of St. Louis, plans to save Eastland by 
making it a center of discount stores and high-volume sellers. Two of them, 
Marshall's and Ross Dress for Less, are doing decently there already. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a unique thing for us, and a unique thing in the industry," said 
Randall Smith, director of research and corporate communications for May 
Centers. "Eastland will be more compatible with The Plaza than competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Eastland has been revived before, when its operators enclosed what was an 
open-air plaza in 1979. And just this year, the parking lot got a $3-million 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
With a row of hotels and popular restaurants nearby, city officials and owners 
also are looking at plans to add a cinema complex to the mall. 
</P>
<P>
EASTLAND SHOPPING CENTER WEST COVINA

</P>
<P>
* Retail square footage: 740,000

</P>
<P>
* Number of stores: 56 
</P>
<P>
* Estimated 1989-90 sales tax paid to city: $877,101

WHERE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY SHOPS; 
</P>
<P>
AT LEAST A FEW IDEAS APPEAR TO BEAR REPEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By IRENE CHANG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes people complain that the retail and food offerings in their 
neighborhood mall are all starting to look alike. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes they're right. 
</P>
<P>
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* In the Glendale Galleria, there are two nearly identical Chinese eateries -- 
Panda Express I on the second floor and Panda Express II on the first floor. 
Panda I serves stir-fry dishes in a restaurant-like setting, while Panda II is 
in the mall's food court. 
</P>
<P>
* Not to be outdone, Montebello Town Center seems to have cloned its Italian 
restaurants. There is a Cafe Sbarro and a Sbarro's Italian Eatery. 
</P>
<P>
* If you get a hangnail at the Montclair Plaza, manicures are available at J C 
Penney, Merle Norman Cosmetics, LA Nails, Le Monacos, Los Bravos, and Sunshine 
Beauty. 
</P>
<P>
* Santa Anita Fashion Park has at least three places where you can buy a 
chocolate ice cream cone: Baskin-Robbins, Bob's Old Fashioned Ice Cream, and 
Haagen-Dazs. Unless, of course, you want chocolate yogurt. For that, try Yogurt 
Palace. 
</P>
<P>
* For footgear, the Puente Hills Mall has Kinney Shoes, Payless Shoe Source, 
Thom McAn , Leeds. Children's shoes? Buster Brown Shoes and Stride Rite Shoes. 
Plus 13 other shoe stores and shoe departments in all four department stores. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say there is no variety in the world of malls. After all, for 
lunch at Puente Hills you can choose between no fewer than three major fast 
food chains -- Carl's Jr., McDonald's, and Taco Bell. IRENE CHANG

PEOPLE IN THE NEWS: PASADENA PICKS EXECUTIVE ARTS PROGRAMS DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Denise Nelson Nash, a former arts coordinator in Los Angeles, has been selected 
as Pasadena's executive director for the arts following a six-month search. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Jan. 7, Nash, 36, will receive $55,478 annually to develop and 
recommend city arts policies and programs, and provide staff assistance to the 
City Arts Commission. 
</P>
<P>
With 17 years in the arts, Nash most recently coordinated the after-school arts 
program for the Plaza de La Raza School of Performing and Visual Arts in Los 
Angeles. She also served as a panelist for the California Arts Council and as 
an advisory board member for the Los Angeles Festival of Masks and the 
Performing Tree. 
</P>
<P>
* Bill Sato, a 29-year Pasadena city employee, has been named city engineer, a 
post that pays $79,719 annually. 
</P>
<P>
He replaces David Barnhart, the former city engineer who left in September for 
a job with the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Sato, 55, received a civil engineering degree from USC and began work with 
Pasadena as an associate engineer. He has been involved in street and lighting 
improvement projects and the rehabilitation of the Colorado Street Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
* Two San Gabriel Valley doctors, Robert K. Gustafson of San Marino and Robert 
E. Burky Jr. of Covina, were honored by Orthopaedic Hospital of Los Angeles for 
their volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
The two traveled to the Valley Orthopaedic Clinic in Calexico to screen 
children for possible surgery or diagnostic treatment at the Los Angeles 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Jewish Temple and Center has honored Abe and Florence Katzman with 
a lifetime membership recognizing 44 years of service, including leading 
fund-raising and charity projects.

SPORTSCOPE: PUNTER NAMED SCHOLAR/ATHLETE ALL-AMERICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sophomore Brian Parvin from Mt. San Antonio College of Walnut, the leading 
punter in the state community college ranks last season, has been selected to 
the JC Grid Wire Scholar/Athlete All-American team. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Ganesha High in Pomona, Parvin posted a 3.8 grade-point average 
and also averaged 41.8 yards on 57 punts including two that went 59 yards. An 
All-Mission Conference first-team selection who has been recruited by UC 
Berkeley, Pacific and Nevada Las Vegas, Parvin had 15 punts that went 50 yards 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of Parvin marks the third year in a row that a Mt. SAC player has 
been named to the All-American squad. Defensive lineman Tom Berry received the 
honor in 1988 and offensive lineman Alan Maxwell was chosen in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a great honor for Brian and for the football program here," Coach 
Bill Fisk said. "We're proud to have three players named scholar/athletes three 
years in a row." 
</P>
<P>
The Pomona-Pitzer women's tennis team and Claremont-Mudd-Scripps men's squad 
have received high rankings in a preseason NCAA Division III poll by the 
Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Pomona women were ranked No. 2 behind defending champion Gustavus Adolphus 
of Minnesota. Pomona is led by returning players Shelley Keeler and Caryn 
Cranston. Keeler was ranked No. 1 in singles and combined with Cranston for the 
top spot in doubles, where they were the 1990 Division III champions. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona's No. 2 doubles team of Erin Hendricks and Brenda Pierce was also ranked 
No. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Claremont was ranked No. 4 as a team in men's Division III play on the strength 
of returning players Lance Au and Ryan McKee. Au is ranked No. 3 and McKee No. 
9 and the pair is ranked No. 2 in doubles. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona is ranked No. 9 in the men's division led by Reed Newhall at No. 10 in 
singles play. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Swartz, who guided the Pomona-Pitzer men's soccer team to a share of its 
first Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference title since 1980, 
has been named NCAA Division III Far West Region coach of the year by the 
National Soccer Coaches Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
The Sagehens finished 11-5-1 and went 8-1 in the SCIAC. It is the second time 
that Swartz has been honored as a regional coach of the year. In 1985, he was 
named National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics New England Region coach of 
the year at Thomas College of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
Distance runner Angel Martinez of San Gabriel High and long and triple jumper 
Juliana Yendork of Walnut have been invited to compete in the prep division of 
the Sunkist Invitational Track Meet on Jan. 18 at the L.A. Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Yendork has been the top long and triple jumper in the state the past two 
seasons and Martinez is regarded as one of the top distance runners in the 
state. Martinez finished seventh in the Western Regionals of the Kinney 
National Prep Cross-Country Championships in Fresno last month.

FISHING / DAN STANTON; 
</P>
<P>
SPORTKING SKIPPER WAS HOOKED ON THE SPORT FROM TIME HE WAS 10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Peterson of San Pedro was only 10 when he started ocean sportfishing. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson, now 41, said he scrubbed decks and did any work required to go out 
fishing with one of the local captains. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959, he became a full-time deck hand under Captain Don McLean aboard the 
Pierpoint Landing boat Sea Angler. 
</P>
<P>
According to McLean, Peterson's fishing savvy and expert boat handling was 
evident at a young age. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson said he knew at age 16 that he wanted to some day own and operate his 
own sportfishing boat. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968 Peterson got his captains license and was hired as a relief captain at 
Pierpoint Landing to run the half-day boat Matt Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
That winter he was given the first nighttime sand dab run to Catalina Island on 
the boat Pierpoint. 
</P>
<P>
He said the nightly sand dab trips were excellent throughout the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson continued to work relief on all the Pierpoint boats until he took a 
job aboard the boat Freedom. He ran it for six years, fishing Catalina and San 
Clemente islands until Pierpoint Landing in Long Beach closed down. 
</P>
<P>
Again being without a boat to run, he became a relief captain working out of 
San Pedro. The boats went to Morro Bay to fish for albacore. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, Peterson bought the 65-foot Sportking that he runs out of Ports O' 
Call Landing. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982 Peterson obtained the lease on the L.A. Harbor Sportfishing Landing. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 he had one of largest one-day catches aboard the Sportking when anglers 
decked 85 albacore and a 130-pound marlin on a special albacore trip. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson trained two of his deck hands, Marc Pisano and Paul Strasser of San 
Pedro, who are now professional sportfishing skippers and own the half-day boat 
Monte Carlo that operates out of 22nd Street Landing. 
</P>
<P>
The Sportking is a three-quarter day boat that Peterson runs Monday through 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: Charles Phlugh of Long Beach, fishing aboard the Toronado 
off of Catalina, caught the whopper of the week, a 27-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Scott McLeavy of Palos Verdes, fishing at Cherry Bank aboard the Blackjack, 
caught a 26-pound cow cod. 
</P>
<P>
Tami Sawa of Culver City, fishing at the deep hole aboard the Sumo, caught a 
21-pound white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Crowin of Palos Verdes, fishing off of Catalina aboard the Outerlimits, 
caught a 21-pound yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: Several days of unsettled weather slowed the action. 
</P>
<P>
Boats that did get out landed a variety of species. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing: The Spitfire fished the bay and anglers caught 
150 sculpin and four halibut. The Betty O fished the shallow rocks and anglers 
sacked 101 rock cod and a lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
At Redondo Sportfishing: The City of Redondo, on a half-day trip, returned with 
110 rockfish and 18 sand bass. 
</P>
<P>
At 22nd St. Landing: The New Image trip to Santa Barbara Island resulted in a 
catch of 117 whitefish, 57 calico bass and 41 sculpin. 
</P>
<P>
At L.A. Harbor Spotfishing: The Matt Walsh, on a half-day trip, returned with 
33 calico bass, 21 sculpin and three sheephead.

PEPPERDINE'S LEAR JETS TO THE TOP WITH NEW NUMBER AND ATTITUDE; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: JUNIOR IS THE ONLY RETURNING PLAYER NAMED TO LAST SEASON'S ALL-WEST 
COAST CONFERENCE TEAM. 
</P>

Before the basketball season began, Pepperdine power forward Geoff Lear changed 
his uniform number from 3, his high school number, to 34 as an indication, he 
said, of his new attitude toward the game. 
</P>
<P>
The former Bishop Amat star said that he probably should be wearing No. 6 
because he wanted to play twice as well this season as he did in his first two 
years in college. But he chose No. 34, he said, because that is the jersey 
number of his favorite professional player, Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 
76ers. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the style of Barkley, Charles the Great," Lear said. "If I can do 
everything as well as he does, I'll be happy with my performance." 
</P>
<P>
By that standard, Lear has been happy at times and unhappy at others. And 
Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury has felt the same way about Lear. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-8 junior, the only returning player named to last season's All-West 
Coast Conference team, must have been overjoyed in his team's first three 
games. Pepperdine opened with victories over Montana State, Fresno State and UC 
Santa Barbara and Lear averaged an impressive 15.3 rebounds.

But Pepperdine went 2-4 in its next six games and Lear's rebounding has dropped 
off. He is still his team's top rebounder with a 10.1 average and is averaging 
a team high 17.2 points. 
</P>
<P>
Lear's numbers are more than respectable, but occasionally he does not live up 
either to his own expectations or to those of Asbury. 
</P>
<P>
Before the season, Asbury said that Lear has been inconsistent in the past but 
that this season he had "practiced harder and more consistently than in his 
first two years." But he added that Lear's role has changed from that of a 
supporting player to that of a leading actor, a role that calls for consistency 
in games as well as in practice. 
</P>
<P>
"When you go from a support player to the go-to guy, it becomes increasingly 
difficulty to compile big numbers," he said. "Then it's just a matter of what 
point in time in your career do you become the go-to guy. I think he's ready 
for it; he's demonstrated at times that he's ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
He was not ready in a recent game, particularly on defense because the player 
he was guarding scored 12 points in the first half. At halftime, Lear said that 
he was lectured by Asbury for his soft defense. 
</P>
<P>
"In the locker room, Coach Asbury bawled me out; he was on my rear end a lot," 
Lear said. "I guess I blocked it out; most guys would have crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
"If you let it get to you, it can affect your performance. You've got to be 
ready to play and block out everything." 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Lear held his man to two points. 
</P>
<P>
Lear said that he thinks he understands why Asbury gets on his case when he 
does not play well. 
</P>
<P>
"He's trying to make an example out of me to the younger guys," he said. "He 
doesn't want the younger guys going half-speed or being lackadaisical, but to 
play up to their potential." 
</P>
<P>
Asbury also wants intense performances from Lear night after night. 
</P>
<P>
"He understands that he is sometimes being outplayed by some inferior players. 
He understands that he has great ability." 
</P>
<P>
Asbury thinks that Lear is capable of being a dominating player. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's what he wants and has worked hard for over the years," Asbury 
said. "He's willing to step up and be that guy. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern is not his scoring; he will get his points. We don't need 25 points 
(a game) from him, but we do need 10 rebounds. We need him to be a dominant 
rebounder." 
</P>
<P>
Lear realizes that Asbury is counting on him as a team leader, "and I'm glad 
I'm in that position." 
</P>
<P>
Lear remembers when the roles were reversed and he was watching from the bench 
as Asbury lectured the starters. 
</P>
<P>
"They were the horses, and it was no skin off my nose," Lear said. "It's hard 
to accept blame, but I'd rather accept it than put it on somebody else. I 
figure if I put my mind to it, I can get 16 or 17 rebounds every night." 
</P>
<P>
Levy Middlebrooks, Pepperdine's career rebounding leader, figures the same way 
about Lear. 
</P>
<P>
Middlebrooks is taking classes at Pepperdine and hopes to finish work on his 
degree soon. Last season he played professionally in Spain, but he tore an 
Achilles' tendon and has taken a year off from basketball to recover. 
</P>
<P>
Middlebrooks, who was instrumental in recruiting Lear for Pepperdine, said he 
thinks Lear is capable of replacing him as the school's career rebounding 
leader. He said that he attended one of Lear's prep games in the hope that his 
demonstration of interest would convince Lear to come to Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
The visit by Middlebrooks worked. 
</P>
<P>
"Levy Middlebrooks had the most influence on me when he came to one of my 
games," Lear said. "No other (college) player did that. That act spoke louder 
than any words." 
</P>
<P>
Lear said that this season's team may be young and inexperienced, but that it 
has talent. It also has harmony, something that may have been missing from the 
team in his first two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the guys are closer this year," he said. "There is no animosity on the 
team, which makes it more fun to play. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not see us staggering in the league. I'm confident we can win this 
thing."

<P>
In a more just world, "Me and the Boys" would have been a big hit for NRBQ. For 
that matter, the band's just-released retrospective CD, "Peek-A-Boo," would 
have been subtitled "Greatest Hits, 1969-1989" instead of "The Best of NRBQ, 
1969-1989." 
</P>
<P>
But Joey Spampinato, the singer-bassist who has been in the band since its 
start in 1967, isn't about to let the wide gulf between a "hits" collection and 
a "best of" collection get him down. After all, hits or not, how many bands 
survive long enough to compile a double-decade retrospective? 
</P>
<P>
"Every band wants to have a hit record. If they say they don't, they're lying," 
Spampinato said during a recent interview from his Nashville home. "You always 
shoot for that. But we've been around for how many years? And we're still 
going." 
</P>
<P>
"Me and the Boys," which dates back to 1980, is one of several terrific songs 
about cars -- and various things that people do in cars -- that crop up on 
"Peek-A-Boo." Never a band given to deep Angst or weighty social statements, 
NRBQ is more inclined to capture simple emotional moments. "Me and the Boys" 
could be about the band's own freewheeling approach to rock 'n' roll: Few bands 
could trace the zigzagging stylistic road map that NRBQ traverses in a typical 
show. 
</P>
<P>
"Peek-A-Boo" and last year's fetching "Wild Weekend" album showcase a band that 
can dig up rock's roots with the loose assurance of The Band, or dab charming, 
inventive colors on a pure-pop canvas in a way that recalls Brian Wilson's 
method with the Beach Boys. NRBQ also has a pronounced zany streak, both 
musically and in its stage presence. 
</P>
<P>
The shaggy-haired, sweet-voiced Spampinato is probably the most solid and 
straightforward of the bunch (maybe that's why Keith Richards drafted him into 
the backing band for his Chuck Berry tribute film; in February, Spampinato will 
back Eric Clapton in a special series of blues shows in London). Drummer Tom 
Ardolino has been known to croon ditties to a miniature doll that's a spitting 
image of himself. Singer-guitarist Al Anderson cuts a huge but humorous figure 
with his grumpy scowls, and hyperactive keyboardist Terry Adams can spend hours 
on stage looking as blissfully in his own world as a tot in a sandbox. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no set thing of what this band is supposed to be," Spampinato said. 
"We like to be multifaceted and encompass all the things we like." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Spampinato said, when NRBQ goes on stage it throws out the usual road 
map that most bands use: a pre-planned list of songs to play. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to work better to play a song at the spur of the moment, so we let 
Terry do that," Spampinato said. "He's most affected by what he would like to 
play at a given moment, so we give him the job."

STEPHANIE HAYNES IS ON THE ROAD AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, Bill Kohlhaase is a free-lancer who writes about jazz for 
The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
You think you were busy before Christmas. Singer Stephanie Haynes, who lives in 
San Juan Capistrano, says she traveled "about 600 miles" making gigs during one 
week in December, with a club date in Rancho Cucamonga on Sunday, the grand 
opening of a Japanese nightclub in Torrance on Tuesday, a stop at Chadney's in 
Burbank on Wednesday and a weekend engagement at a new nightspot, Central Park 
West, in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
The following week found her doing three nights in the Sheraton San Pedro's 
Stingaree Gulch room with pianist Gildo Mahones. Talk about roadwork. She's 
back in Orange County today at El Matador Restaurant in the Huntington Harbour 
Mall with bassist Luther Hughes, keyboardist David Garfield and drummer Paul 
Kreibich. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there's good reason why she's in such demand. Her warm tone, smart 
sense of phrasing and a huge repertoire of jazz standards has won her 
comparison to singers such as Irene Kral and Sarah Vaughan. "I've listened to 
both of them a lot, but I don't consciously try to sing in their style," Haynes 
said last weekend. "I think people hear certain qualities in my voice that 
remind them of Kral, but your sound is God given. You can't really change it." 
(And as for Vaughan? "Nobody has a voice like that.") 
</P>
<P>
Singing came late to Haynes, who originally had designs on being a classical 
flutist. But while studying the instrument at UC Santa Barbara, she began 
hanging out with musicians who were into jazz and who played for parties and 
dances. "They asked me if I could sing," she recalls, "and before long, I was 
getting up to sing the only two songs I knew the words to: 'Misty' and 'Satin 
Doll.' " 
</P>
<P>
After moving to Albuquerque in the early '70s, she began working the local 
scene. She returned to Southern California in 1974 and since has appeared in 
clubs, restaurants and hotels all over the area. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no real effort involved for me to become a singer," she said. 
"Having a background in instrumental music made it easy. Singers have a pretty 
bad reputation as musicians, but I had all the basics, how to count, how to 
stay in key. . . ." She said she has no desire to return to the flute. "I've 
never had the desire to play jazz on the flute. I've tried it and know how it 
should sound, but I've got all that classical training to overcome. I hear 
myself and say: 'No, that's not going to do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Haynes has come a long way from the days when "Misty" and "Satin Doll" were the 
only songs she knew. The most recent of her two recordings, 1988's "Here's That 
Rainy Day" (on Trend/Discovery with keyboardist Cedar Walton, bassist Al 
McKibbon and drummer Billy Higgins) is a collection of Jimmy Van Heusen tunes 
that includes well-known numbers such as "It Could Happen to You" and "Darn 
That Dream" alongside such lesser known vehicles as "I Could Have Told You." 
Live, she mixes familiar warhorses -- "I'm Old Fashioned," Duke Ellington's "I 
Didn't Know About You" -- with Brazilian numbers such as Jobim's "No More 
Blues." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, she's been looking more to the Brazilians for material. "There's a 
whole genre of modern Brazilian music that doesn't have the exposure it should 
have," she said, citing composer-performers Ivan Lins, Milton Nascimento and 
Leny Andrade, a singer who because of her scat skills often is called the 
Brazilian Ella. "I'm open to any kind of music that sounds good to me. But 
nothing sounds good to me unless it's coming out of the jazz tradition or it's 
Brazilian. I hear pop music -- you can't avoid it these days -- but I don't 
hear any that I like." 
</P>
<P>
She thinks taste in music is a function of age. "The young haven't been exposed 
to this kind of music; they don't have a consciousness of jazz being different 
from any other form of entertainment. That has to be taught, but where do they 
get the instruction? They'll pay attention to rock bands because they are blown 
away by the volume and can involve themselves by dancing. But everything else 
remains dressing for socializing, certainly not for listening." 
</P>
<P>
Haynes will be going into the studio in January with pianist Alan Broadbent, 
bassist Putter Smith and drummer Kreibich to record more jazz standards. On tap 
are Freddie Hubbard's "Up Jump Spring," Sonny Rollins "Pentup House" and Benny 
Golson's "Whisper Not" (with lyrics by Leonard Feather). She'll also begin an 
open-ended, five-day-a-week engagement at Ron's in Palm Desert on Jan. 3 (a 
stint at Ron's in Laguna Beach, with bassist Hughes, lasted 2 1/2 years). It 
looks like, for Stephanie Haynes, next month will be as busy as this one. 
</P>
<P>
Who: Stephanie Haynes, with Luther Hughes on bass, David Garfield on keyboards 
and Paul Kreibich on drums. 
</P>
<P>
When: Thursday, Dec. 27 at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Where: El Matador Restaurant, 16903 Algonquin St., Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Whereabouts: Take the Valley View Street exit from the San Diego Freeway and 
head toward the ocean. Valley View will turn into Bolsa Chica Road, which will 
dead-end at Warner Avenue. Go right onto Warner until the next traffic signal, 
where it intersects with Algonquin Street. El Matador is in the Huntington 
Harbour Mall.

<P>
Wherewithal: Free.

TIPS FOR WATCHING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Naturalist Suzanne Campbell's Whale Watching Tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * Reservations are recommended for most cruises, so call at least a day ahead. 
</P>
<P>
* Dress warmly, preferably in layers, and wear rubber-soled shoes. 
</P>
<P>
* If you think you'll need it, take motion-sickness medication an hour before. 
Check the label to be sure it doesn't cause drowsiness. 
</P>
<P>
* Bring binoculars, sunscreen, sunglasses and snacks, because some boats don't 
have galleys. 
</P>
<P>
* Be patient and keep your eyes open. You might also see sharks, sea lions, 
dolphins, sea birds and other species of whales.

WATCH THOSE WHALES;

UP AND DOWN THE COAST, EXCURSIONS AND WORKSHOPS ABOUND

<P>
It's the end of December, time for the annual migration of out-of-town 
relatives and their slightly larger, less chatty kin, California gray whales. 
</P>
<P>
From now until March, these behemoth beauties (the whales, not Aunt Tilly) will 
cruise Orange County's shoreline en route from their summer homes off the 
Alaska coast to Baja's balmy lagoons and back. Whale watchers of all ages can 
participate in several educational workshops and cruises countywide. 
</P>
<P>
According to Harry Helling, associate director of the Orange County Marine 
Institute, the great grays are typically spotted three to five miles off the 
coastline and even have been known to appear in area harbors. But pinpointing 
when they'll be seen can be trickier. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about wild animals, so it's really anybody's guess," Helling 
said. "But generally, sightings begin right after Christmas, then crescendo to 
a peak period in late January or early February, slow down, then pick up again 
in early-to-mid-March." 
</P>
<P>
The average gray takes about four months to complete a trip from Alaska to 
Baja, generally departing in mid-September and arriving in mid-January or 
mid-February, Helling said. After calving in the warmer waters (the bouncing 
babies average 15 feet long), the new families begin their homeward trek in 
late February. They may be seen in groups of three to five or singly. 
</P>
<P>
To bring novice whale watchers up to speed, the Marine Institute offers a 
marine wildlife excursion program -- three weekends of slide shows, 
naturalist-led discussions and cruises -- at its Dana Point facility (24200 
Dana Point Harbor Drive, (714) 496-2274.) 
</P>
<P>
The lectures, to be held Feb. 2, 3, 16 and 17 and March 9 and 10, will cover 
basic migration habits, human impact on whales and an overview of marine 
mammals on the California coast. Gray whale and sea lion skeletons and the 
bones of smaller marine animals will be on view. There are tentative plans for 
a puppet show and other children's activities. 
</P>
<P>
A 2 1/2-hour cruise aboard the 65-foot Cortez, skippered by naturalist Mike 
Burske, will be offered before and after each seminar. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike is a master at finding whales," Helling said. "He spent about five years 
doing research on gray whales in San Ignacio Lagoon, one of the chief calving 
areas in Baja. He's very sensitive to the whales and is careful to approach 
them in ways that won't disturb them but will still offer good views." 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the Institute's whale watch are $11 to $14; children younger than 5 
may attend the workshop but are not permitted on the boat. 
</P>
<P>
Farther inland, Suzanne Campbell, a naturalist at the Oak Canyon Nature Center 
in Anaheim Hills (6700 Walnut Canyon Road, (714) 998-8380) will hold a free 
introductory workshop on whale watching Saturday, Feb. 9. Campbell will discuss 
the whales' homeward journey, help visitors select the right excursion for them 
and offer pointers to make their trip more enjoyable (see box). 
</P>
<P>
Here are three commercial whale watching operations: 
</P>
<P>
* Davey's Locker Sportfishing in Newport Beach offers 2 1/2-hour trips 
departing several times daily from the Balboa Pavillion. Members of the local 
chapter of the American Cetacean Society will narrate and answer questions on 
board the 77-foot boat, which features inside and outside viewing areas and a 
snack bar. An added plus: If you don't spot a whale, you'll be given a rain 
check good for a free trip on another day. Tickets run from $6 to $11. (714) 
673-1434. 
</P>
<P>
* Dana Wharf Sportfishing offers three two-hour narrated cruises each day from 
Dana Point Harbor aboard a 65-foot powerboat that has inside and outside 
viewing areas and a galley. Rain checks are offered during the first part of 
the season only. Tickets: $6 to $10. (714) 496-5794. 
</P>
<P>
* The Spike Africa, the 70-foot wooden-hulled schooner featured in the movie 
"Joe vs. the Volcano," will depart four times each weekend from Newport Harbor. 
A member of the American Cetacean Society will be aboard to provide pointers 
and answer questions. Catering services are planned. Tickets: $25. (714) 
642-9988. 
</P>
<P>

at (714) 675-9881.

ROSY PROSPECTS? Oregon, which plays Colorado State in Anaheim's Freedom Bowl 
Saturday, has followed Washington's progress with interest. . . . Washington 
plays in the Rose Bowl New Year's Day but preceded that with the Freedom Bowl 
last year and the Independence Bowl three years ago. Oregon has been following 
the same trail, starting with last year's Independence Bowl. "Next year, with

Boatright. Robyn Norwood and Ann Conway

DRUNK-DRIVER PUSH CITED AS O.C. TRAFFIC DEATHS DIP

<P>
Orange County had only one traffic death during the five-day Christmas weekend, 
and law officials are crediting the stepped-up effort to arrest drunk drivers 
as a major reason for the decline in holiday fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
Other county officials said anti-drug and alcoholism programs that help people 
recognize the danger of driving under the influence have had an effect. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't want to go to jail," said Bill Edelman, manager of drug programs 
for the county Health Care Agency. "I think people are beginning to look at the 
consequences of getting into a car and driving under the influence of any 
substance. Law enforcement efforts, especially sobriety checkpoints, have had 
an impact." 
</P>
<P>
Some jurisdictions, such as the California Highway Patrol, reported higher 
numbers of drunk-driving arrests compared to last year. Other departments 
reported a decrease, which they said may reflect more caution on the part of 
drivers. Officials said these two trends are not contradictory -- fewer drunk 
drivers are on the highways but concentrated efforts, such as those of the CHP, 
sometimes result in a higher number of arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all agreed that getting drunk and drug-influenced drivers off the 
highway was a key to the county's relatively safe Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
The Christmas holiday death toll was lower than it has been for the past five 
years, according to the Orange County coroner's office. The county had four 
highway traffic deaths during Christmas 1986, five in 1987, seven in 1988 and 
five in 1989, the coroner reported. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, during the five-day Christmas weekend this year, 404 people were 
arrested on drunk-driving charges in Orange County. The CHP arrested 152 of the 
total, and the remaining arrests were by all other police jurisdictions in the 
county. The CHP said its drunk-driving arrests in the county this year were up 
36% compared to last year. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Richard J. Olson, spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department, 
said comparison data is not available for all other police jurisdictions 
because he began assembling holiday drunk-driving arrest statistics this year 
for the first time. Olson, however, said he thinks the number of drunk-driving 
arrests is up this year compared to other Christmas holidays. 
</P>
<P>
The sole traffic fatality between 6 p.m. Friday and 12:01 a.m. Wednesday was 
the death of a 19-year-old Fountain Valley man at 5:30 a.m. Saturday on the San 
Diego Freeway at the Magnolia Street on-ramp. Deputy Coroner William King said 
the youth, Major J. Johnson, lost control of the car and crashed into a call 
box. King said there was no indication that the accident was alcohol- or 
drug-related. 
</P>
<P>
Arresting alcohol-impaired drivers has been easier for police this Christmas 
season. A new state law that became effective Jan. 1 lowered the legal 
blood-alcohol level from the 0.10 to 0.08. 
</P>
<P>
Some cities, including Fullerton, reported that increased efforts to halt drunk 
drivers had led to higher arrest totals this year. Lt. Bud Lathrop said 
Fullerton had 534 driving-under-the-influence arrests in 1989 and has made 619 
such arrests so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
But in Garden Grove, police reported that a sobriety checkpoint on Saturday 
night stopped about 1,100 cars and did not find a single drunk driver. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove Traffic Officer Fred McLean said the absence of drunk drivers at 
the checkpoint indicated that people are being more cautious about drinking. 
"It seems that if there's a lot of publicity that there's going to be a 
checkpoint, more people are using designated drivers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, police arrested 11 suspected drunk driver during the 
five-day holiday. Lt. Ed McErlain said he had no number for comparison purposes 
but believes that the number of arrests is low compared to other years. He too 
said this is a sign that fewer drunks are behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to think that our enforcement, combined with education efforts, are 
working," McErlain said. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing you like is never getting (drunk-driving accidents) to begin with," 
added Sgt. Richard S. Zschoche of the Anaheim Police Traffic Bureau. "You're 
looking for the deterrent factor." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim was among Orange County cities that stepped up roving police patrols 
looking for inebriated drivers during the holidays. "We started this on 
Thanksgiving . . . and will continue right through New Year's," Zschoche said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's hundreds of Alcoholics Anonymous chapters aided the efforts to 
keep drunk drivers off the streets by holding more meetings than during 
non-holiday weeks. Some AA groups held what they called "marathon," or 
round-the-clock, meetings so that people with alcohol problems had a place to 
go regardless of the time of day. 
</P>
<P>
Ron LaPorte, manager of alcoholism programs for the county's Health Care 
Agency, said Wednesday that he feels certain that education and prevention 
efforts are now paying off. 
</P>
<P>
"I absolutely believe that we are having an impact," LaPorte said. "I also 
believe that attitudes and social norms about drinking are changing. It's not 
considered cool or a lot of fun now to get drunk during the holidays. And 
people are being made aware of the consequences, such as getting arrested. 
People are starting to think a little bit differently about intoxicants and 
celebrations." 
</P>
<P>
Edelman, manager of the Health Care Agency's drug programs, agreed that 
education efforts are helping keep "high" drivers off the road. "I think we're 
beginning to turn the tide and reach young people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some cab companies reported Wednesday that they are taking part in a holiday 
program to keep drunk drivers off the street. Bill Craig, manager of Coast 
Yellow Cab, said that at participating taverns and restaurants, the bartenders 
worried about a patron's ability will hand out a coupon good for a free cab 
ride within a 20-mile radius. Craig said his company has been getting up to 50 
such calls a day since Friday, when this year's holiday program began. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman said the change in societal views about alcohol and drugs and the 
diverse efforts to prevent impaired drivers are now bearing fruit in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe it's beginning to pay off," he said. "I think we're beginning to 
see things turn around."

COMATOSE WOMAN DIES AFTER ARTIFICIAL FEEDINGS ARE HALTED; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: NANCY CRUZAN WAS THE CENTER OF A LANDMARK RIGHT-TO-DIE CASE. PROTESTERS 
IN ORANGE COUNTY AND ELSEWHERE IN U.S. CALL HER DEATH A FORM OF MERCY KILLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Cruzan, a 33-year-old automobile crash victim who remained comatose for 
nearly eight years as a landmark right-to-die case involving her went all the 
way to the U.S. Supreme Court, died Wednesday in southwestern Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
Cruzan died at the Missouri Rehabilitation Center in Mt. Vernon with her family 
at her bedside and about 20 "right-to-life" protesters huddled in subzero 
temperatures outside. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of death was listed as "shock, due to dehydration, due to severe head 
injury," a hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Knowing Nancy as only a family can, there remains no question that we made the 
choice she would want," her parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan, said in a statement 
read by Donald Lamkins, the hospital administrator. "Nancy, we will always love 
you and hold your memory in our hearts." 
</P>
<P>
The statement added: "She remained peaceful throughout and showed no sign of 
discomfort or distress in any way." 
</P>
<P>
Since she nearly suffocated in a January, 1983, early morning automobile 
accident, Cruzan had been in a "persistent vegetative state," a form of 
permanent unconsciousness in which she was able to breathe on her own but had 
no awareness of her self or her surroundings. Her face was red and bloated; her 
arms and legs were severely contracted. Her medical care had been estimated to 
cost the state about $130,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Cruzan died 12 days after Judge Charles E. Teel Jr. of Jasper County Circuit 
Court in Carthage, Mo., ruled that her parents could stop her artificial 
feedings. The feedings, through a tube surgically placed into Cruzan's stomach, 
were stopped within hours. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, right-to-life groups tried seven times, without success, to get 
other courts to order Cruzan's feeding tube reconnected. In addition, 19 
protesters were arrested on Dec. 18, after they stormed the hospital, vowing to 
reconnect the feeding tube. 
</P>
<P>
"The family will continue to suffer, but at least Nancy is at rest," said Thad 
C. McCanse, a Carthage attorney who was Cruzan's court-appointed legal guardian 
and who supported the family's request to stop the feedings. "It is not 
something I am going out and celebrate, but I am relieved." 
</P>
<P>
Teel's Dec. 14 ruling ended a three-year legal fight that resulted in a 
landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in July. The high court ruled that a 
person whose wishes are clearly known has a constitutionally protected right to 
reject life-sustaining treatment. 
</P>
<P>
But the court said also that states, as Missouri had done, may limit the 
practice of allowing families to make such decisions for persons whose wishes 
are not clearly known and who are so disabled that they are unable to speak for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court decision led to a nationwide surge of interest in "living 
wills" and "durable powers of attorney for health care," legal documents that 
can be used to indicate a person's wishes or to authorize someone else to make 
medical decisions if an individual is unable to do so. Other people have simply 
discussed their wishes with their physicians, which is generally considered a 
good medical practice. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Cruzan's predicament "has caused people to think about making plans for 
something that, before, nobody ever wanted to talk about -- what to do if there 
is no hope and I am hooked up to machines," McCanse said in a telephone 
interview. "In this way, her life has had a positive effect on a lot of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
The Cruzans were initially frustrated by the Supreme Court decision. But the 
family and its attorney produced additional witnesses who testified that Nancy 
Cruzan had indicated that she would not want to be fed by force or kept alive 
by machines. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Nancy Cruzan's physician, Dr. James C. Davis, who had believed 
that the tube feedings should be continued, changed his mind. When asked to 
imagine himself in Nancy Cruzan's state, Davis testified that "it would be a 
living hell." 
</P>
<P>
This new testimony led Teel to decide that the criteria set by the Supreme 
Court had been satisfied. "The court, by clear and convincing evidence, finds 
that the intent of . . . (Nancy Cruzan), if medically able, would be to 
terminate her nutrition and hydration," Teel wrote in a brief judgment. 
</P>
<P>
During a two-hour interview with a Times reporter in July, 1989, the parents 
and older sister of Nancy Cruzan described her as a fiercely independent, 
upbeat woman who was much loved by family and friends. They said she 
particularly enjoyed animals, children, holidays and the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
"So much of it (the family's belief that Nancy would not have wanted to go on 
living in her current state) stems from who she was before the accident. She 
was so vibrant, so vital, so alive," her sister, Christy, said. 
</P>
<P>
Right-to-life groups have depicted the decision to halt Nancy Cruzan's feedings 
as a form of euthanasia, or mercy killing. 
</P>
<P>
"In this season of hope, Nancy Cruzan's death by starvation and dehydration 
diminishes hope for thousands of medically dependent people nationwide," said 
David O'Steen, executive director of the National Right to Life Committee in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Finn, a spokeswoman for Operation Rescue in Anaheim, said: "I feel that 
this was an unprecedented case where a woman was allowed to starve herself, and 
I think we're going to see a flood of similar cases now. It's terrifying to 
think about where our nation is going." 
</P>
<P>
Some medical ethicists, however, dispute claims that the Cruzan case will lead 
to widespread euthanasia. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very comfortable with the Cruzan case," said Dr. Jerome Tobis, chairman 
of the bioethics committee at UCI Medical Center in Orange. "There is always 
the risk of a slippery slope . . . that may lead to abuses, but with caution, I 
don't think there's any basis to think so." 
</P>
<P>
However, he added: "The Cruzan case should not sanctify active euthanasia, a 
very important thing that we in the medical profession and ethicists in this 
country are certainly opposed to." 
</P>
<P>
Protesters had camped in the parking lot of the hospital for the last nine 
days. One of their signs referred to the facility as the "Missouri Euthanasia 
Center." 
</P>
<P>
Major medical organizations, including the American Medical Assn. and the 
American College of Physicians, and leading medical ethicists viewed Cruzan as 
a prisoner of modern medical technology, kept alive with no hope of recovery 
and against her apparent wishes. They argued that life-sustaining treatments, 
such as a respirator or a feeding tube, may be withdrawn from such individuals 
if appropriate safeguards against abuses are adhered to.

D.A. PLAYS DOWN PROP. 115 RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi said the state Supreme Court's 
decision this week to void a provision of the California anti-crime initiative 
does not spoil all the sweeping reforms won last summer and will not change the 
daily operations of his office. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was widely considered a defeat for state prosecutors, Capizzi said 
that Monday's court ruling left intact other elements such as provisions for 
the broader uses of the grand jury system and for police testimony at 
preliminary hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"These many reforms permit us to operate more efficiently," Capizzi said. "I 
don't think the ruling has any impact on what's being done." 
</P>
<P>
Local opponents of Proposition 115 were pleased with the ruling but were not 
celebrating the state Supreme Court's decision to throw out a provision that 
required state courts to follow more restrictive U.S. Supreme Court rulings in 
applying a dozen constitutional rights in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no great shakes for the defense," Deputy Public Defender Kevin Phillips 
said, "but we're happy that a decision went our way." 
</P>
<P>
The provision that was struck down would have required state courts to strictly 
follow U.S. Supreme Court rulings in applying the rights of equal protection, 
due process, protection against unreasonable searches, assistance of counsel, 
personal presence at trial, speedy trial, the attendance of witnesses, privacy, 
and protection against self-incrimination and cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
The interpretation of these rights in state courts has often provided 
Californians with greater protections than under similar provisions in the 
federal Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"All the court did (Monday) was say, 'Listen, you can't delegate that to the 
federal system,' " Phillips said. "It's a pretty limited decision." 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi said that while he would have liked for the provision to remain as a 
safeguard, the present makeup of the state's high court makes the ruling more 
palatable, given the absence of the court's more liberal leadership under 
former Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the provision) would have prevented the court from taking us off to La-La 
Land or Bird land," Capizzi said. "With this court's philosophy, they are more 
inclined to correspond with the interpretation set forth by the U.S. 
Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
Other elements of the initiative that remained untouched in Monday's ruling 
were hailed by Capizzi as important in the day-to-day operations of his office. 
Most important, he said, were provisions that deny the right to preliminary 
hearings to defendants indicted by grand juries and the right of police 
officers to present hearsay testimony in preliminary hearings, saving victims 
from having to appear in proceedings other than at trial. 
</P>
<P>
He said those elements and the provision that will allow judges to question 
prospective jurors will speed up the criminal justice system and provide more 
time for the presentation of evidence. KEVIN JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NORTH TUSTIN;

<P>
6,000 RESIDENTS TURN IN APPLICATION FOR CITYHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHANNON SANDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A residents group seeking to form the city of North Tustin submitted more than 
6,000 signatures Wednesday along with an application for cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Colangelo, executive officer of the Local Agency Formation Commission, said 
that a public hearing on the proposal probably will be held in April, assuming 
the registrar of voters verifies that there are at least 4,533 valid signatures 
of registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
If the commission approves the incorporation, it would be on the ballot in 
November, Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Rawitch, a proponent of incorporation, said about 115 members and 
supporters of Citizens for More Local Control have been collecting residents' 
signatures for the past three months and will continue to collect more. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to let the commission know that we think there is an overwhelming 
support for this in the community," Rawitch said. 
</P>
<P>
Incorporation proponents say that creating a new city would give residents 
political autonomy and help maintain the semi-rural atmosphere of much of the 
area more effectively than annexation to Tustin and Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Some North Tustin residents disagree, however, and would prefer to annex to 
adjacent cities or remain unincorporated. 
</P>
<P>
Letter-writers to local newspapers have debated the issue for several months, 
some of them criticizing a feasibility study that was released last summer. 
</P>
<P>
While that study indicated that an annual utility users tax of $73 per 
household would be required, a new, more comprehensive study found that no new 
users tax would be required until the city's ninth year, said Michael Bannon, a 
consultant with Christensen &amp; Wallace of Oceanside, the firm that prepared 
the study. At that time, the tax would be the equivalent of $74 today, Bannon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The new city would be able to delay putting the new tax into place because of 
funding from Measure M and additional gas tax revenue through Prop. 111, Bannon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The financial picture is even brighter in the comprehensive study than in the 
initial study," Rawitch said. 
</P>
<P>
Phyllis Spivey, an opponent of incorporation, was one of those who criticized 
the initial study for not including a capital improvement program or other 
necessities. 
</P>
<P>
"There were major problems with the preliminary study and I suspect there will 
be major problems with this one as well," said Spivey, who had not seen the new 
study yet. SHANNON SANDS

25TH ANNIVERSARY LOGO PRIZE AWARDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A graphic design professor at Golden West College has won a $2,500 contest for 
designing a logo for the school's 25th anniversary, which will be celebrated 
beginning next September. 
</P>
<P>
The professor, Jack Heard, is also director of the campus Fine Arts Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised that I won," said Heard. "I expected a lot of pros to be working 
on this. I'm not into contests that much. I'm used to working on logos with a 
client where there is a lot of give and take. A contest is a one-shot deal." 
</P>
<P>
Heard's winning design, picked by a panel of judges as the best among 80 
entries, shows a sleek numeral 25 in semicircles and stripes. 
</P>
<P>
According to Fay L. Hendry, the campus public relations director, the $2,500 
contest award comes from private funds and not taxpayer dollars. 
</P>
<P>
One of the judges, Frank Hopkins, owner of an advertising agency in Fountain 
Valley, said: "This (winning entry) is one of the most original designs I have 
seen for combining a 2 and a 5."

GIRL SCOUT COUNCIL TO GET NEW CENTER

<P>
A spacious new program center for the Girl Scout Council of Orange County will 
be built on the site of a structure that was burned beyond use in a fire a year 
and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, city and scouting officials joined in the groundbreaking for the new 
structure, which will provide meeting and event space for area troops. 
</P>
<P>
"We are finding it more and more difficult to find a place to meet," said Diane 
Smith, publicity director for the Girl Scout Council. "As sorry as we are that 
the building burned down, it gives us an opportunity to redo it with conference 
rooms and space we really need." 
</P>
<P>
Smith estimates there are about 22,000 Girl Scouts in the county, and about 
seven troops -- or just more than 100 girls -- will be able to use the new 
facility and remaining swimming pool for meetings and programs. 
</P>
<P>
Since the building was destroyed in June, 1989, there has been no North County 
facility for the organization. Construction of the new 4,000-square-foot 
building on Broadway in Anaheim is under way, and is expected to take six 
months to complete. LISA MASCARO

FIRE DESTROYS HOME AT TREASURE ISLAND

<P>
A fire destroyed a seaside mobile home Wednesday, causing $35,000 damage and 
killing two pet birds, Laguna Beach fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Battalion Chief Joe McClure said no one was injured in the 8:42 a.m. blaze at 
the Treasure Island Trailer Park, 30801 Coast Highway, which began while owner 
Vicki Wantland was at work. 
</P>
<P>
No other structures were damaged in the five-minute fire, which shot out 
through the windows and was fueled in part by the mobile home's wooden 
paneling, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wantland's two pet cockatiels died in the fire, McClure said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire appears to have started because a fireplace in the structure was aged 
and cracked, allowing heat to penetrate to a wall, McClure said. 
</P>
<P>
"The heat over the years had turned the wood in the wall to become like 
charcoal and have a fairly low ignition (temperature)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said homeowners should periodically inspect fireplace mortar by poking it 
with a screwdriver to check for brittleness. 
</P>
<P>
"If it appears weak, they should contact a masonry contractor and have it 
repaired," he said. TERRY SPENCER

PEOPLE: COLLECTION OF STUBS IS FULLERTON MAN'S TICKET TO EVENTFUL HOBBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After watching Nolan Ryan throw a no-hitter at Anaheim Stadium, Michael G. 
Hess, thought to himself, "I better save the ticket stubs. You never know. They 
might be worth something." 
</P>
<P>
That was June 1, 1975. 
</P>
<P>
From that first ticket, Hess has amassed a collection of 10,000 stubs from an 
assortment of events. 
</P>
<P>
At first Hess hoped to make money by collecting and selling the stubs but 
decided that he would rather avoid the stresses of bartering, such as that 
experienced by baseball card traders. 
</P>
<P>
He has never sold any of the stubs. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm just fascinated in learning about the people who bought the ticket in 
the first place," said the Fullerton resident. "When I take a look at the 
ticket stub I wonder about the guy who spent his last 10 bucks for it." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, adds Hess, "I'm hoping to locate some of the people who owned the 
stubs and meet and talk to them about the event they attended. That would be 
the real kick of it all." Some of his ticket stubs include those from game 
three of the 1989 World Series in San Francisco on the day of the earthquake, 
the day Hank Aaron hit his 715th home run, a stub from a Bush vs. Dukakis 
debate and one for the filming of a Pepsi commercial at which pop idol Michael 
Jackson was burned in a freak accident. 
</P>
<P>
The stubs, some catalogued in binders, but most stored in shoe boxes, are from 
concerts, plays, travel, transportation, tourism, political events, pageants, 
museums and amusement parks. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything that requires a ticket,' said Hess, who estimates that he has 
attended only a few hundred of the events for which he has ticket stubs. "Many 
of those are from UCLA games," the Bruin fan said. 
</P>
<P>
Hess has set up a network of helpers throughout the United States with whom he 
trades stubs, including correspondents in Texas, Indiana and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be very selective sending ticket stubs to people you have never 
met," he said. "For a while I was sending some really good ones, but I wasn't 
getting good ones back." 
</P>
<P>
The best have a history attached to them, such as a no-hitter in baseball, 
according to Hess. He sometimes advertises in newspapers for stubs for 
particular events. 
</P>
<P>
Although he doesn't keep a written record, Hess contends that he can track all 
his stubs in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"I may not be able to tell you what I had for dinner last week, but I can tell 
you each stub I have," he said, adding that that includes what each stub looks 
like. 
</P>
<P>
"Tickets made years ago were all special, but the tickets of today are all 
plain," he said. "They all started to look like that when you started buying 
from the electronic booth like Ticketron." 
</P>
<P>
He has established a "stub of the week contest" at his workplace at Hunt-Wesson 
Foods in Fullerton, and at year's end throws a banquet and gives awards for the 
best stubs contributed to his collection. 
</P>
<P>
Hess considers himself a small-time collector. He said he is unaware of any 
organization of ticket-stub collectors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there is a market out there for them," said Hess, who does not know 
how much his collection is worth. 
</P>
<P>
"When you try to make money from your hobby you lose the worth of it," he said, 
pointing out that the fun is in the collecting, not the selling. "Guys that try 
to make money on it, ruin it." 
</P>
<P>
While he has stubs from many events, "I still don't have one from a Beatles 
concert," he said. "The collection will never be historically complete without 
one of them."

ZOO ELEPHANT'S DEATH STIRS FUROR; 
</P>
<P>
ANIMALS: HUMANE SOCIETY CRITICIZES SAN DIEGO ZOO OVER ITS 'EXTREMELY DANGEROUS' 
PACHYDERM EXHIBIT. BUT OFFICIALS SCOFF AT HIS STATEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Investigators at the Humane Society of the United States sent a letter 
Wednesday to the San Diego Zoo charging that its elephant exhibit is inadequate 
and "extremely dangerous" for both the huge mammals and their keepers. 
</P>
<P>
The letter to Doug Meyers, director of the San Diego Zoological Society, was 
prompted by the death Sunday of Maya, a 51-year-old Asian elephant that was put 
to death after she fell into a moat and crippled herself. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not question the care Maya received after her tragic fall into the moat, 
nor the fact that euthanasia was the humane decision to make on her behalf," 
wrote David K. Wills, a vice president in the Humane Society's Department of 
Investigations. "However, we are concerned as to what steps zoo officials are 
going to take to improve conditions for the surviving elephants." 
</P>
<P>
Wills criticized the exhibit for its uninsulated floors and its lack of heat 
inside the barn, its limited outdoor shelter and its daily reliance upon chains 
to restrain the elephants. In addition, he charged that a catwalk that connects 
two areas of the elephant yard is precariously narrow, and he called for it to 
be widened. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Jouett, a spokesman for the zoo, acknowledged that the nearly 30-year-old 
elephant yard is "not perfect," but he said the zoo is in the midst of making 
improvements. So far, they have planted shade trees, he said, and replaced 
decaying floor boards with cement. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett said the zoo also plans to widen the catwalk. But he rejected Wills' 
claim that "if the catwalk were widened, Maya might still be alive today," 
saying that while no one witnessed her fall, her placement in the moat 
indicated she did not fall off the walkway. Jouett also dismissed Wills' 
assertion that the exhibit, which now houses one African and three Asian 
elephants, is "grossly inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
"It has passed USDA inspections, and we'll welcome the USDA to come look at it 
again," Jouett said, noting that Wills has asked the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture to investigate the exhibit. He called most of Wills' allegations 
"just exaggerations to catch the public's attention. It makes nice quotes but 
it's just not true." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Homer Malaby, a USDA animal care specialist in Sacramento, said he will 
visit the zoo next week to investigate the Humane Society's allegations. Of 
particular interest, he said, was their charge that the animals have no way to 
escape the rain during the day because they are locked out of their barn. 
</P>
<P>
"If the only shelter the animals have from inclement weather is their indoor 
housing facility, and if they're put out every morning and not allowed back in, 
no matter what the weather, then yes, that would be a violation of the Animal 
Welfare Act," Malaby said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jouett said that the barn door is always opened when it rains. 
</P>
<P>
"They only need walk into the barn," he said, characterizing Wills' letter as 
an attempt to drum up negative publicity. "It's the animal ambulance chaser 
syndrome -- take a tragedy and use it to get your name in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
Wills' letter asserts that nearly half of the zoos approved by the American 
Assn. of Zoological Parks and Aquariums have abandoned the practice of chaining 
elephants at night. 
</P>
<P>
But Jouett said he was "sure" that was an overstatement -- he has only heard of 
a handful of zoos that don't use chains. In the winter months, he said, the San 
Diego Zoo chains its elephants for 16 hours a day, while the rest of the year 
the animals are chained for about 12 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"They're chained for the protection of the elephants and the people to make 
sure they don't steal each others' food and to maintain the safety of the 
keepers," Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett called Wills' contention that the elephant barn should be heated 
"intentional misrepresentation." 
</P>
<P>
"The temperature in the elephant barn is not cold," he said. Even during the 
recent frigid weather, he said, when the barn is closed at night "a person 
could walk in there and break a sweat. We have four huge animals that are like 
furnaces -- four huge masses of body heat. Elephants have a problem staying 
cool, not staying warm. It's not a concern."

<P>
A 22-year-old Marine was killed Wednesday when his motorcycle collided with an 
18-wheel tractor-trailer rig, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, whose name was withheld pending notification of relatives, was 
pronounced dead at the scene of the 8:20 p.m. collision at the intersection of 
Red Hill and Edinger avenues, Tustin Police Lt. Frank Semelsberger said. 
</P>
<P>
The motorcyclist was believed based at the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Air 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
Details about the accident were sketchy, but Semelsberger said a preliminary 
investigation indicated that the motorcyclist sped through a red light in the 
southbound lanes of Red Hill Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"For whatever reason, the driver of the truck wasn't able to stop in time to 
avoid hitting the motorcycle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The motorcyclist was wearing a helmet at the time, as well as a heavy jacket 
and leather gloves. He was headed in the direction of the Tustin base, but it 
was not immediately known whether he was scheduled to report for duty.

2 APARTMENT FIRES IN ORANGE INJURE 1, CAUSE HEAVY DAMAGE

Firefighters battled two separate blazes that left one woman critically injured 
and caused nearly $200,000 in damage to three apartments Wednesday night, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The fires broke out within an hour and 10 blocks of each other in downtown 
Orange and for a time had firefighters fearful that brisk winds would spread 
sparks to neighboring wood roofs. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fires was under investigation, but Battalion Chief Doug 
Flaherty of the Orange Fire Department said they were unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
The first blaze broke out shortly before 9:30 p.m. in a duplex in the 200 block 
of Foley Place, according to Fire Capt. Rich Eggers. 
</P>
<P>
A woman inside the duplex, identified as Mona McKay, 69, suffered severe burns 
and was rushed to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where she was listed in 
critical condition. Several firefighters were treated at the scene for minor 
burns, Eggers said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire caused $80,000 to $100,000 in damage to one unit in the two-story 
duplex, Eggers said. The second unit was not damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Word came about 10:15 p.m. of the second fire, in a four-unit apartment complex 
in the 800 block of North Olive Street, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported from that fire, but two units were demolished and the 
remaining two were damaged by smoke. Flaherty said the damage could exceed 
$80,000. 
</P>
<P>
The four families displaced by the fire found shelter with friends, according 
to Steve Cooper of the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the firefighters left the Foley Place blaze for the Olive Street fire. 
When units first arrived at the second fire, flames and smoke were showing in 
the roof, prompting concern that the fire could spread. But firefighters were 
able to bring the blaze under control a short time later.

COMMITTEE WILL IDENTIFY START OF RECESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A panel of private economists, used by the government to decide whether the 
economy is officially in a recession, will probably pinpoint a month between 
June and September as the start of the current downturn, the group said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But the panel stopped short of identifying the exact start of a recession, 
saying it was still too early to tell. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears likely that the committee will identify a month between June and 
September, 1990, as the peak of activity in the economy and the onset of a 
recession," said the group. 
</P>
<P>
"However, because many data are still preliminary, the committee has not made a 
definite determination of the turning point," added the group, which is the 
government's official arbiter of peaks and troughs in the business cycle. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the panel of academic economists said output and employment in 
the United States were falling. 
</P>
<P>
But the committee will make a decision "only after the data show a sufficiently 
long and deep contraction that the episode would be termed a recession even if 
it were followed immediately by a strong upturn in the economy." 
</P>
<P>
The seven members of the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle 
Dating Committee conferred Friday by telephone, after several members said a 
recession had begun. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the panel agreed a recession had probably started, but they had not 
agreed on the exact month, said Victor Zarnowitz, emeritus professor of 
economics at the University of Chicago and a panel member. 
</P>
<P>
The committee is unlikely to confer again before the release of fourth-quarter 
gross national product figures Jan. 25, Zarnowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
The group defines recession as "a recurring period of decline in total output, 
income, employment and trade, usually lasting from six months to a year and 
marked by widespread contractions in many sectors of the economy."

As part of a debt reduction plan, Furon Co. said Wednesday it will sell its 45% 
interest in NTN-Rulon for about $16.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel-based Furon, which makes polymer products, said it will sell the 
interest to its partner, NTN Corp., a major bearing manufacturer based in 
Osaka. NTN now owns the other 55% of NTN-Rulon, a maker of plastic bearings 
with annual sales of about $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We will use the proceeds to pay down our debt, which is one of our long-term 
goals," said Furon Chairman Peter Churm. He added that NTN-Rulon will become a 
wholly owned subsidiary of the Japanese company, which likes to control 
production and sales of its businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Furon's long-term debt stood at $153 million and its net worth was about $57 
million in March, 1989, after it acquired three companies from Bundy Corp., 
including NTN-Rulon's parent, Dixon Industries Corp. Furon said the sale of its 
interest in NTN-Rulon will lower its long-term debt to about $62 million and 
put its net worth at more than $97 million. 
</P>
<P>
"We are way ahead of schedule on our debt-reduction campaign," Churm said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the dissolution of the joint venture, Furon and NTN have agreed to 
continue buying each other's products and materials. They've also agreed to 
continue the technical exchange that started in 1973 between NTN and Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
"We were able to strike a mutually acceptable deal," said Furon President 
Michael Hagan. "The good news is that the business will continue as before." 
</P>
<P>
Since the subsidiary is run by NTN and its employees, none of Furon's 3,000 
employees in the United States will be affected by this transaction, he added. 
Furon has about 450 employees in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Hagan said NTN executives initiated the talks earlier this year to buy Furon's 
interest, but serious negotiations did not begin until last month. 
</P>
<P>
The move is part of NTN's plan to expand its U.S. presence. Last year, it 
formed NTN Driveshaft Inc. to manufacture constant-velocity joints for Japanese 
auto-makers in the United States. The 105-acre property in Columbus, Ind., 
which will serve as its U.S. production base, will be operational in 1991.

MONDAVI SETS UP CENTER, COMPLETE WITH NEW VINEYARD, TO ENHANCE WINE'S IMAGE

<P>
Michael Mondavi thinks wine is getting a bad rap. 
</P>
<P>
Mondavi, president of a multimillion-dollar Napa Valley wine company that 
carries the family name, is convinced that it all began in the health-conscious 
'80s, when wine and many other alcoholic beverages were sidelined by the "me" 
generation in favor of Spandex workout suits and oat-bran protein drinks. He is 
on an all-out campaign to bring back the days when a glass of wine with a meal 
was socially acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything in life has to be done in moderation and that includes drinking 
wine," said Mondavi from his Napa Valley office. "If you overindulge with 
anything -- such as food or what have you -- you're going to have a problem, 
but if you drink wine with sensibility, it's not going to be a hazard to your 
health or your lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
To spread that message around, the Mondavi family opened a 10,000-square-foot 
wine and food center last year in the heart of an increasingly booming 
industrial area in Costa Mesa. The center -- the family's first venture outside 
of Northern California -- is aimed at educating retailers and the public about 
wine appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Furlotte, publisher of the Wine and Beverage guide in New York, said: 
"Mondavi has certainly been in the forefront of fostering a better 
understanding of the role that wine has played in civilization through the 
years and in educating people about the positive aspects of wine. 
</P>
<P>
"While there may be other wineries attempting to do something similar, Mondavi 
is certainly on the cutting edge of educating consumers and continues to be the 
voice of reason in an environment in near hysterics whenever the term 'alcohol' 
comes up." 
</P>
<P>
This is not your average tasting room, where the wine curious walk in and are 
served a dribble of the vintner's offerings. You'll need reservations to attend 
one of the events here. 
</P>
<P>
Among the dozens of seminars offered by the winery's education department are 
tastings to introduce wines and discuss food pairings, and the more technical 
seminars that identify the major components in wine. There are blind tastings 
to compare Mondavi quality with wines from the world's top growing regions, 
monthly cooking classes and a large kitchen that showcases the work of visiting 
chefs invited to the center to prepare meals for guests attending private 
receptions, luncheons and meetings. 
</P>
<P>
And there is a newly planted vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Hansen, Mondavi's director of corporate accounts, said the vines planted 
on an acre of land next to the center's complex are part of the company's 
educational interest. "We planted the initial root-stock vines in September and 
with them we are hoping to show the complete process of winemaking, with such 
beginning procedures as the cultivation of the roots." 
</P>
<P>
It will take about three years before any wine can be produced from the vines. 
But, Hansen added, "even at that point the wine will be used for purely 
experimental and educational purposes. We are not turning this operation into 
an actual winery. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in a very long while that vineyards have been planted 
in Orange County, so we are very anxious to see what happens," Hansen 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
A wine colony was started in Anaheim by German immigrants in the mid-1850s. 
Ideal weather made grapes one of the leading crops in the county, and wine was 
bottled under the Mother Colony label, according to county historian and author 
Jim Sleeper. But in 1888, phylloxera, a plant louse that destroys vines, caused 
the fruit and vines to shrivel all over the county. Called the "Anaheim 
disease," it caused the local industry to fade into oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 100 years later, a wine bearing the San Juan Creek label appeared. 
Released in 1985, the wine was made from Johannisberg Riesling grapes planted a 
dozen years before in the 71-acre Gobernadora Canyon vineyard a few miles from 
the San Juan Capistrano Mission. It was bottled at a winery near Temecula. 
Owner Richard J. O'Neill and his vice president for agriculture for Rancho 
Mission Viejo cited high daytime temperatures and increasing humidity in the 
afternoon as assets for growing grapes. 
</P>
<P>
Weather had nothing to do with the Mondavi family decision to build here. 
</P>
<P>
"We moved an operation to the Orange County area because that area is central 
to everything," Mondavi said. "People in San Diego as well as folks in Los 
Angeles who want to come and get some information on wine can now do so without 
going to Napa Valley." 
</P>
<P>
The Mondavi name has been a mainstay in the wine industry ever since Michael's 
father, Robert, left his family's Charles Krug Winery in 1966 to build the 
first new winery in California since Prohibition. Robert Mondavi, 77, who 
recently retired from daily management operations, is credited with changing 
the sleepy California wine industry of the early 1960s into an arena of 
world-class winemaking. There were only about two dozen wineries in Napa County 
then, compared to more than 200 now, with more on the way. 
</P>
<P>
Company President Michael Mondavi, who is an equal managing partner of the 
company along with his brother, Timothy, says the company's major objective 
continues to be educating the American public about wine and its proper role as 
a mealtime beverage. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe making good wine is a skill," Michael said. "Wine is art -- and as 
art, wine is at its best when enjoyed with fine food, while surrounded by art 
and music." 
</P>
<P>
The center's Art Deco-styled building, which is surrounded by a rose garden and 
sculptures, has marble floors, a grand piano, classic furnishings and artwork 
on loan from some of the finest collections in the country. 
</P>
<P>
While company officials won't disclose what it costs to run the elaborate 
education center, Hansen said the company is pleased with the success enjoyed 
by the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Mondavi and other premium vintners in the state have good reason be grateful: 
About 85% of the wine made in the United States comes from California. Last 
year, home-grown wines rang up $6 billion in retail sales in this state alone. 
And while wine sales are flat nationwide, sales of California's premium wines 
have increased an average of 19.6% a year over the past five years, according 
to a survey by Habrecht &amp; Quist, a San Francisco investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of health worries and the increased emphasis people have been putting 
on the negatives of drinking in recent years, people are not as likely to 
consume alcohol, particularly hard liquor," said Furlotte of the Wine and 
Beverage guide. "The wine industry has suffered to some extinct because of 
that, but higher-priced, better-quality premium wines have enjoyed quite an 
increase in sales, much to the benefit of companies like Mondavi." 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the last time that sales figures for Mondavi were available, the 
winery grossed $2.6 million with its premium wine sales, compared to $2.4 
million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Furlotte added that the country's new attitude toward wine is: drink less but 
drink better. "There is, of course, a big image thing in America where people 
want the best of everything out of life. That means cars, homes, clothes, and 
right down to the foods and wines they eat and drink. It's total mind set that 
focuses on the finer things in life, no matter the cost. 
</P>
<P>
"Mondavi is certainly reaping the benefits of the current trend," Furlotte 
said. "Most wineries that have concentrated on the finer wines are all enjoying 
a bit more success than the rest of the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Vintners also have some facts to regret: Starting Jan. 1, a federal excise tax 
on table wine will add about 50 cents to the retail price of a standard bottle 
of wine. Some industry experts predict that the increase might reduce wine 
consumption by 12%. 
</P>
<P>
Though Mondavi is positioned well in terms of sales, the company faces a 
potential danger that industry watchers say could hurt Northern California 
wineries for the next 10 years: phylloxera has affected about 250 acres, 
primarily in Napa and Sonoma counties. Replanting with new phylloxera-resistant 
vines may cost $250 million in Napa County alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, we'd decided to used another type of root stock, one that is 
resistant to the disease, prior to it reoccuring," Mondavi's Hansen said. "Up 
until about three years ago, most wineries had root-resistant stock planted, 
but now that doesn't seem to be working, which means a total change in the 
roots being planted." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen said the Mondavi operation will gradually uproot and replant its Napa 
Valley vineyard over the next seven years. 
</P>
<P>
"Years ago, the vines had enough space between them so that a horse could get 
through to plow, and later on tractors, but we've found that the more we do 
with our hands, the better quality fruit we produce," Hansen explained. "So now 
we are replanting the vines closer together, which will give us more vines per 
acre and less grapes on each vine, which will also enhance the grapes' flavor."

HOW TO REPORT A MALFUNCTIONING TRAFFIC SIGNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE BOZANICH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is frustrating. There you are sitting at a traffic signal, waiting for it to 
change. You watch what seems to be a thousand cars whiz by, and still no 
change. You go into reverse and run over the electronic loop, hoping to 
activate the signal in your favor, but still no change. You get so irritated 
you get out of the car and go press the crosswalk button. 
</P>
<P>
And still no change. 
</P>
<P>
You finally give up and whip through a nearby gas station in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
Don't let it end there, because you just might find yourself sitting at that 
particular signal again. 
</P>
<P>
In every city of the county, motorists can report malfunctioning and mistimed 
traffic signals. The county has a traffic engineering division to do the same 
for signals in the unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans will respond to complaints about signals on state-maintained roads 
such as Pacific Coast Highway, Coast Highway, Imperial Highway, Laguna Canyon 
Road and most of Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The number of complaint calls about traffic signals varies considerably from 
city to city, from 50 a week in Newport Beach to one or two a month in the 
smaller cities, traffic officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints range from seemingly mistimed signals to non-working left-turn 
arrows; from an out-of-whack rotationto a light that has gone out altogether 
(this last is the most dangerous situation of all, traffic officials say.) 
</P>
<P>
The fault does not always lie in the machinery, however. In some cases, the 
motorist failed to prompt the light by not running over the electronic loop in 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park traffic engineer Herb Vargas said that there was one case in which 
the city resorted to painting the electronic loop so that motorists could see 
where to run over it. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the complaints from drivers who think they were kept waiting far 
too long at a particular signal only to have a field check show that the signal 
is functioning normally. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say we get a number of calls that don't check out to be what was 
reported," said Ron Garrett, traffic engineering technician in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Although many cities have central computer systems to monitor signals, through 
the electronic loop system, traffic officials must still rely on the public to 
report many problems. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a list of phone numbers to call to report mistimed and malfunctioning 
signals. You must be able to provide the place, the approximate length of time 
you waited there and the direction you were driving.

ORANGE COUNTY JAZZ HIGHLIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though Orange County still lacks a big-name jazz venue such as Catalinain Los 
Angeles or Elario's in San Diego, there still were plenty of sounds for the 
digging here in the past year. Here are five of the best: 
</P>
<P>
* Jack DeJohnette, with guitarist Pat Metheny, keyboardist Herbie Hancock and 
bassist Dave Holland at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, June 15. 
Despite smudgy sound, the drummer and his well-known sidemen offered smart, 
rhythmically accessible compositions and a generous sampling of free form 
interplay during a long, ultra-contemporary set that highlighted Holland's wise 
technical skills and DeJohnette's raw power. This is one superstar 
collaboration worth a sequel. 
</P>
<P>
* Anita O'Day at Cafe Lido, Sunday, May 13. An afternoon spent with a legend. 
What the singer has lost in clarity over the last 40 years, she has gained in 
character, and the chance to see her emote in such intimate surroundings was a 
pleasure indeed. Hip, attuned support came from saxophonist Gordon Brisker, 
pianist Marty Harris, bassist Harvey Newmark and drummer Paul Kreibichq. 
</P>
<P>
* Miles Davis at the Coach House, Feb. 23. We get to see Davis a lot here in 
Orange County -- this was his third Coach House appearance in nine months -- 
and his play list hasn't really changed much in the last few years. But every 
Davis show has its transcendent moments, and this one came during Michael 
Jackson's "Human Nature," a surprisingly appropriate vehicle for Davis' lyrical 
minimalism and rhythmic mix. 
</P>
<P>
* Shorty Rogers, Bill Perkins with the Les Czimber Trio at Gustaf Anders, Oct. 
28. Trumpeter Rogers, one of the deans of the West Coast sound, stuck to 
original material without the benefit of having rehearsed the rhythm section. 
The results were exciting, as Rogers blew light, yet involved narratives that 
contrasted with Perkins' more muscular tenor sax sound. Credit pianist Czimber, 
bassist Bruce Lett and drummer Nick Martinis as quick studies. 
</P>
<P>
* Eric Marienthal with the Luther Hughes Trio, El Matador, Aug. 31. Once again, 
intimacy was a plus as saxophonist Marienthal, usually seen in much larger 
venues with Chick Corea's Elektric band, teamed with dapper L.A.-based 
keyboardist Tom Ranier, bassist Hughes and drummer Chuck Landis to show some 
chops on all-out versions of tunes like John Coltrane's "Giant Steps." A show 
full of spontaneity, responsiveness and blazing improvisation. Music always 
seems hotter when you're close enough to see the musicians sweat. 
</P>
<P>
* Honorable mention goes to Bill Bruford and Earthworks' Oct. 19 Coach House 
show, a promising hybrid of electric and acoustic, traditional and exploratory, 
that other fusion bands would do well to emulate. 
</P>
<P>
* With that in mind, this year's Waste o' Time award is presented to Acoustic 
Alchemy for its July 20 Coach House show, a somnambulate mix of acoustic 
guitars and synthesizer wash put to predictably bland themes and repetitive 
rhythms. Guitarists Nick Webb and Greg Carmichael would do well to put their 
considerable technical facilities to more serious use.

POP BEAT: ORANGE COUNTY 1990 THE YEAR IN REVIEW; 
</P>
<P>
O.C. ARTISTS HAD VINTAGE RECORDING YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
THE MUSIC RANGING FROM DANCE POP TO HEAVY METAL WAS PUT INTO AN UNPRECEDENTED 
NUMBER OF GOOD RECORDS. 
</P>

<P>
The year 1990 was a record year for the Orange County pop music scene -- record 
in the toss-it-on-the-box-and-listen sense of the word. 
</P>
<P>
In styles ranging from dance pop to heavy metal, alternative rock to country, 
locally based artists turned out an unprecedented number of good recordings, a 
vintage crop of strong new music that isn't likely to be surpassed easily in 
any coming year. 
</P>
<P>
But in terms of what the world beyond our borders heard, the Orange County 
recording that mattered most in 1990 was a quarter-century old. In one of the 
biggest surprises of the year, the Righteous Brothers' gorgeous 1965 ballad, 
"Unchained Melody," became a pop phenomenon, thanks to its inclusion as the 
love theme in the hit-movie "Ghost." Righteous Brothers Bobby Hatfield and Bill 
Medley didn't reap a new fortune from the song's success, having sold the 
royalty rights to their '60s catalogue years before. But they did profit from 
the release of a new, true-to-the-original rendition of "Unchained Melody." In 
one of the year's oddest developments, the new "Unchained Melody" reached No. 
19 on the Billboard singles chart in early November -- with the original 
version holding the No. 17 spot the same week. 
</P>
<P>
Louie Louie, the dance-pop singer from Santa Ana, also had a Top 20 single with 
"Sittin' in the Lap of Luxury." While his debut album, "The State I'm In," 
didn't result in the quick rise to stardom that some had predicted for the 
handsome, charismatic singer, it established him as a talented contender. 
</P>
<P>
The same was true of Social Distortion, the veteran Orange County punk band 
whose 1990 album, "Social Distortion," was the third of the band's career and 
its first for a major label. SD toured extensively, building on its 
long-established cult audience and placing its album on the Billboard Top 200 
albums chart for several months. 
</P>
<P>
Another veteran of the local scene country singer Jann Browne also began to 
attract a national following with her well-received debut album, "Tell Me Why." 
Stryper, the Christian pop-metal band that had been Orange County's biggest 
commercial success of the '80s, shot quickly up the albums chart with its 1990 
release, "Against the Law," only to see it fall just as rapidly off the charts. 
The lack of staying power may have been due to musical changes, as Stryper 
adopted a tougher sound and turned away from overtly religious messages in its 
lyrics. Then again, it may have been due to chaotic business conditions at 
Enigma Records, which underwent severe staff turnover and drastic cutbacks. One 
of the most promising Orange County talents, folk-rocker Vinnie James, signed 
with RCA Records but saw the release of his already-finished debut album, "All 
American Boy," delayed until February, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
For a discriminating rock fan, staying home and listening to the best of the 
locals on record offered more rewards than seeing most of the big-name shows at 
the county's outdoor amphitheaters. With a handful of exceptions at both the 
Pacific Amphitheatre and Irvine Meadows, it was an uninspiring year for 
concert-going in the great outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Performing Arts Center marked another year unsullied by the 
low-brow musical excitations of the Baby Boom generation. Lacking any other 
suitable mid-size, indoor venue (many acts won't appear in the in-the-round 
format of the Celebrity Theatre), the county was bypassed by some of the year's 
most attractive tours, including Sinead O'Connor's and Van Morrison's. 
</P>
<P>
On the club scene, the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano remained the county's 
top venue for national touring talent, but its four-year monopoly didn't go 
unchallenged. One bid to rival the Coach House fizzled when Hamptons, a 
beautifully appointed but undercapitalized nightclub in Santa Ana, went dark in 
May after about five months of promisingly eclectic, but too-often unsuccessful 
bookings. Next came Peppers Golden Bear, part of a club and restaurant chain, 
which opened in August in Huntington Beach. Peppers' stated ambition was to 
bring back the glory days of the original Golden Bear, which had been the 
county's only major pop club until it closed in 1986. But the Coach House, with 
its well-established business relationships and good reputation, continued to 
get most of the prime pop attractions. Still, Peppers' size advantage -- a 
seating capacity of 580, compared to 380 at the Coach House -- gives it the 
potential to develop into a significant stop for touring pop acts. 
</P>
<P>
The grass-roots rock scene for Orange County continued to revolve around 
Bogart's in Long Beach, the club most devoted to fostering creative local 
talent. It is largely because of Bogart's that the Long Beach and Orange County 
alternative-music scenes have fused into a single entity. Night Moves in 
Huntington Beach tried to distance itself from its punk-flavored, 
alternative-rock image by changing its name to Foul Play and attempting to tone 
down its musical offerings. But by year's end, the old name was back, along 
with most of the old favorite bands. 
</P>
<P>
Peppers showed some interest in giving slots to local bands, especially if they 
fit into the danceable-rock format that the club has come to favor. The Coach 
House also provided an occasional home for locals, but overall the grass-roots 
club scene remained anemic. The efforts of amateur promoters who ran 
once-a-week clubs dubbed the Rat Trap, Club Cannibal and Club Tangent added 
some spark early in the year, but those enterprises inevitably turned out to be 
sporadic or fleeting. Consequently, Orange County's pop-music scene continues 
to look healthier on record than it does in the flesh. 
</P>
<P>
This list of the top albums by Orange County artists includes several -- Lost 
Souls, 3D Picnic, Tender Fury and T.S.O.L. -- whose members reside outside 
county lines. However, each band originated here and continues to have a 
regular local presence. 
</P>
<P>
1. Chris Gaffney, "Chris Gaffney &amp; the Cold Hard Facts" (ROM). Memorable 
melodies, pithy and offbeat lyrical observations and exceptionally skilled and 
zestful playing make this rockin' country album one of the all-time peaks of 
O.C. pop. 
</P>
<P>
2. Eggplant, "Sad Astrology" (Dr. Dream). Weaving together some of the best 
strands in alternative guitar rock, Eggplant's second album is funny and 
poignant, ironic and heartfelt. It's also catchy and inventive, no matter what 
the mood. 
</P>
<P>
3. Rick Elias &amp; the Confessions, "Rick Elias &amp; the Confessions" 
(Alarma). A Christian believer searches for spiritual illumination but does it 
without compromising his gritty, independent, heartland rocker's attitude. 
</P>
<P>
4. Social Distortion, "Social Distortion" (Epic). Repetitive in spots but still 
a highly personal album that merges a punk band's blazing force with the 
timeless quality of strong country and blues influences. 
</P>
<P>
5. 3D Picnic, "Dirt," (Earth Music/Cargo). An eminently hummable cornucopia of 
pop that zig-zags from style to style without losing its charm or its lyrical 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
6. James Harman Band, "Strictly Live ... in '85" (Rivera). Captures the 
all-around excellence and versatility of Harman's tremendous mid-'80s blues 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
7. Bill Ward, "Ward One: Along the Way" (Chameleon). The former Black Sabbath 
drummer tells his own story of decline and recovery with a strong merger of 
metal and progressive rock that features fine guest turns by Ozzy Osbourne and 
Jack Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
8. Lost Souls, "Howlin' at the Moon" (no label). Blues and punk influences 
converge in a multifaceted, intelligent brand of raw biker rock. 
</P>
<P>
9. Burning Tree, "Burning Tree" (Epic). This blues-powered trio hews closely to 
its roots in Hendrix and Cream, but stormy playing and good songwriting make 
this more than an exercise in retro-rock. 
</P>
<P>
10. T.S.O.L., "Strange Love" (Enigma). Lots of metal bands bark about having an 
authentic "street" sensibility. This one backs it up with a gritty sound and a 
dark, fatalistic outlook. Catchy, hard-hitting and, alas, overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Honorable mention: 
</P>
<P>
11. Louie Louie, "The State I'm In" (WTG). 
</P>
<P>
12. Tender Fury, "Garden of Evil" (Triple X). 
</P>
<P>
13. Swamp Zombies, "Scratch and Sniff Car Crash" (Dr. Dream). 
</P>
<P>
14. Rikk Agnew's Yardsale, "Emotional Vomit" (Triple X). 
</P>
<P>
15. Jann Browne, "Tell Me Why" (Curb). 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. O'Leary's Cow Award: Thousands of Robert Plant fans ignited their soft 
drink and beer cups at Irvine Meadows in a brilliant but hazardous and 
air-fouling torchlight salute. 
</P>
<P>
Person We'd Most Like to See in the Ring With Mike Tyson: Donnie Wahlberg of 
the New Kids on the Block tried to prove his macho by publicly haranguing a 
young woman he suspected of giving him a thumbs-down gesture at the Pacific 
Amphitheatre. During the same show, a fan tossed a large, undoubtedly expensive 
toy stuffed animal on stage; Wahlberg kicked it away disdainfully, telling his 
audience not to throw things. 
</P>
<P>
T.S. Eliot Award: The ill-fated Hamptons finished not with a bang, and not even 
with a whimper. Management just shut the doors one day without a word of public 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
Rube of the Year Award: To anyone who cheered Milli Vanilli's singing at Irvine 
Meadows.

10. James Harman Band, "Strictly Live . . . in '85."(Rivera) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
<P>
1. Los Lobos, "The Neighborhood" (Slash). The seemingly simple songs here may 
not make much of an initial splash, but they are like depth charges, resonating 
with life's sorrows and joys when they do sink in, with some great barbecue 
stomps thrown in to boot. A plain masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
2. The Neville Brothers, "Brother's Keeper" (A&amp;M). Forget the car 
commercials, the Nevilles are the heartbeat of America, and perhaps its 
conscience as well, with songs here that look head on at the '90s and at the 
honesty and love it's going to take to survive them. 
</P>
<P>
3. Robert Johnson, "The Complete Recordings" (Columbia). Recorded in a '30s 
hotel room on primitive equipment, bluesman Johnson's legacy carries on into 
the CD age as some of the most naked, human and scarifying music extant. One of 
the treasures of American culture done justice in this 2-CD box set. 
</P>
<P>
4. Chris Gaffney, "Chris Gaffney and the Cold Hard Facts" (ROM). Costa Mesan 
Gaffney may not have a hellhound on his trail, but there's at least an evil 
Chihuahua dogging his heels. The singer-accordionist is a killer songwriter, 
and he brings a powerful sense of mood to both riotous tales of cantina mishaps 
and heartaching ballads of sundered love and fear-locked neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
5. The James Harman Band, "Strictly Live . . . in '85" (Rivera). Other than the 
studio-sounding vocals and harmonica calling this album's title into question, 
"Strictly Live . . . in '85" gives a fair glimpse of what made the old Harman 
lineup -- with guitar wonders Kid Ramos and the late Hollywood Fats -- one of 
the most exciting bands on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
6. Desert Rose Band, "Pages of Life" (Curb/MCA). There's scarcely a hair out of 
place in this highly polished set from Chris Hillman and Co., but the passion 
still comes through in questing songs, rich vocal harmonies and shimmering 
guitar interplay. 
</P>
<P>
7. Jonathan Richman, "Jonathan Goes Country" (Rounder). The wedding of the 
ever-elfin Mr. Richman and a country studio band isn't entirely made in heaven, 
but some of his best songs are here, including a comical romp through Reno and 
a beautiful cover of Marty Robbins' "Man Walks Among Us." 
</P>
<P>
8. The Geto Boys, "The Geto Boys" (Def Jam). Sure, these guys are as 
reprehensible, violent and sexist as anything you'll find on TV, but they're 
also furious and funny, and they pump the most demanding rhythms to come out of 
Houston since Archie Bell and the Drells. The last rap group you'll ever need. 
</P>
<P>
9. Texas Tornados, "Texas Tornados" (Warner Bros). These guys are the real 
Wilburys. Lone Star perennials Doug Sahm, Flaco Jimenez, Freddie Fender and 
Augie Meyers join up to churn out a true, dirt-under-the-fingernails, 
dance-hall celebration. 
</P>
<P>
10. Youssou N'Dour, "Set" (Virgin). Senegalese singer-bandleader N'Dour 
achieves an irresistible blend of African and Western musical influences here, 
with his plaintive vocals soaring above it all.

THE WESTSIDE PAVILION CATERS TO PURE SHOPPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most architecturally striking of the Westside malls, this John 
Jerde-designed shopping center scored a major coup when it nabbed Los Angeles' 
first Nordstrom, the undisputed king of customer service, as one of its anchor 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
And while Nordstrom is the big attraction in the eyes of many shoppers, the 
benefits seem to flow in both directions. The Westside Pavilion store boasts 
the highest sales per square foot of any store in the Nordstrom chain, 
according to Iris J. Callie, vice president for leasing for the mall's owner, 
Westfield Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Pavilion management officials recently strove to make it the mall of choice 
among young couples with children by adding numerous toy and children's 
clothing stores. For many customers it's a one-stop shopping center, because it 
also has a Vons supermarket next to the May Co., its other anchor. 
</P>
<P>
The center also boasts several popular fast-food restaurants and three movie 
theaters, although mall spokesmen say that the center places less emphasis on 
entertainment than competitors such as the Beverly Center and Century City 
Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Ours is more for the pure shopper," said Robert J. Murray, executive vice 
president of Westfield Inc. "We're not an entertainment center. Our emphasis is 
on servicing basic needs." 
</P>
<P>
Although Westside Pavilion wins praise for its bright facade and atrium (Jerde 
was the design director of the 1984 Summer Olympics), customers bemoan the 
heavy traffic they must often fight to get there and the poorly designed 
labyrinthine parking structure that awaits them when they do. 
</P>
<P>
"Parking is a horrible problem," said Karen Parker, a 32-year-old Nordstrom 
devotee who lives in Pacific Palisades. "It makes me not come sometimes. In 
fact, I've come here and then left because there's no place to park." 
</P>
<P>
The parking dilemma is made worse by the prevalence of parking by permit only 
in the surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
A well-publicized mall expansion plan will add 1,000 new parking spaces and 
91,000 square feet of shopping across Westwood Boulevard, connected to the 
existing complex by a 43-foot-wide, two-tier bridge for cars and pedestrians. 
This should ease the parking crunch, but the project has also fanned complaints 
by residents and environmentalists. They contend that the expansion is driven 
more by marketing than by architecture and that the expansion will only put a 
Band-Aid on the parking ailment. 
</P>
<P>
This year for the first time, complimentary valet parking was offered during 
the holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the Westside Pavilion ranked ninth in total sales among Los Angeles 
County's 45 largest shopping malls. On a sales-per-square-foot basis, it is one 
of the region's top performers.

BROWN PICKS 3 WESTSIDERS FOR POSTS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: TOM HAYDEN TO CHAIR EDUCATION PANEL AND IS REPLACED BY TERRY FRIEDMAN 
IN LABOR POST. BURT MARGOLIN TO HEAD INSURANCE COMMITTEE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown has announced that he will name three Westside 
Democrats chairmen of major policy committees when the Legislature reconvenes 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Democrat last Friday officially appointed Assemblyman Tom 
Hayden of Santa Monica as chairman of a new Higher Education Committee; Terry 
B. Friedman of Los Angeles as chairman of the Labor and Employment Committee, 
and Burt Margolin of Los Angeles as chairman of a new Insurance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Brown made his announcement before the Christmas holiday, in part, to end 
speculation about the posts, said Michael Reese, the speaker's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Hayden announced on his own that he was stepping down as chairman of 
the labor committee, a job he had held for two years, and would assume the 
education post. Hayden's announcement came amid speculation that his Democratic 
colleagues were urging Brown to strip him of the labor chairmanship as a 
political punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative sources said lawmakers wanted to send Hayden a message that they 
were displeased with a variety of his actions, including his role championing 
"Big Green," the sweeping environmental initiative rejected by voters in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Along with his labor panel duties, Hayden has been chairman of a subcommittee 
on higher education. He had been urging Brown to elevate the subcommittee to 
full committee status and said he could not turn down the offer. 
</P>
<P>
Under Hayden, the education subcommittee has sought to update the state's 
master plan for its higher education facilities. 
</P>
<P>
In replacing Hayden as the labor panel's chairman, Friedman assumes leadership 
of a full policy committee for the first time since he was elected to the 
Assembly in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman said he expects his committee to be at "the center of many big 
issues." He said he anticipates fashioning legislation to ensure that workers 
receive adequate notice of plant closures and, if necessary, are provided job 
retraining. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker said he also expects to stress worker health and safety 
legislation and focus on employment discrimination, including proposals to 
require equal opportunities for gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
Margolin could not be reached for comment on his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance issues previously were handled by the Finance and Insurance 
Committee. The new insurance panel is expected to review legislation dealing 
with a variety of topics, including health and automobile insurance.

SANTA MONICA PLACE: SHOPPING BY THE SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica Place is identified as the shopping mall by the sea -- by its 
stores and by the number of beach-going visitors that pass through its doors.

The mall has followed the trend toward specialty stores, adding a Pacific 
Sunwear outlet (hip surf garb). It also boasts two environmentally sensitive 
retail outlets in the Heal the Bay Museum and Nature's Own. The great outdoors 
theme is also reflected in its Eddie Bauer store. 
</P>
<P>
Developed and operated by the Rouse Co. of Columbia, Md., the center recently 
remodeled its facade and interior with an eye toward shedding its generic mall 
image. The mall has been aided greatly in that regard by the recently completed 
renovation of the adjacent Third Street Promenade, which has added several 
upscale restaurants and three new movie theaters within a two-block radius. 
</P>
<P>
The $15-million remodeling job, which took nearly 11 months to complete, 
included the addition of several skylights and other decorative touches that 
brightened both the inside and exterior of the beach-side shopping center. 
Marketing officials, however, say the real upgrade involved the addition of 
several new stores, such as Imaginerium, which they are banking on to boost 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
Mall officials say the shopping center is more community-minded than most, in 
part because of its location in downtown Santa Monica and its proximity to the 
city's Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
As a reflection of the city's landscape, mall officials recently planted palm 
trees inside and added a drip fountain in the center court. 
</P>
<P>
"We have certain natural advantages here because of our location," said Robin 
Faulk, marketing director. "A lot of the reasons Santa Monica is great is the 
reason why Santa Monica Place is great." 
</P>
<P>
During the holidays, mall employees are required to park in the Santa Monica 
Civic Center parking lot a few blocks away. Even so, the mall tends to suffer 
from insufficient parking. The problem is sometimes worse on summer weekends 
than during the Christmas season because beach-goers find the mall's lot a free 
and convenient place to leave their cars. 
</P>
<P>
Although the mall competes primarily with Westside Pavilion, its target 
audience is located along the coast, the affluent residents from Malibu to Los 
Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Santa Monica Place ranked 15th in total sales among the 45 largest 
malls in Los Angeles County.

THE BEVERLY CENTER SETS THE TREND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A shopping mall that is also a tourist stop, the Beverly Center dominates the 
upscale fashion market and is considered by most observers to be the trendiest 
mall in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Welton Becket &amp; Associates, the Beverly Center suggests a 
modern version of a castle keep -- a castle devoted entirely to retailing. The 
lower levels are reserved for parking. The shops on the upper levels are 
reached by distinctive glassed-in escalators with views of the hills. 
</P>
<P>
"The Beverly Center is unique in that it has a very strong image, people know 
what it stands for," said Gayle Kantro, marketing director. "This is definitely 
not a cookie-cutter mall." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Orne, 40, shops at the Beverly Center in spite of its distinctive look. 
"It's convenient," said Orne, who lives in Hollywood. A designer of shopping 
malls, Orne finds the Beverly Center downright unattractive. "It's kind of a 
vanilla box," said Orne, who much prefers an outdoor mall to one that is 
"hermetically sealed." 
</P>
<P>
The center's emphasis on high-fashion translates into higher prices, but it's 
one of the best places to find the latest in chic European wear. As mall 
publicists put it, the stores are so cool that one of them is even called Ice. 
Even its two connecting restaurants are hip: the Hard Rock Cafe and California 
Pizza Kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Its uptown tone is what draws Bill and Mary Canaletti to the Beverly Center. 
The couple live in Downey but come to the Westside mall every Christmas Eve. 
"We spend the whole day here," said Mary, who explains that the clothes sold at 
the Beverly Center "are very different" from those available in Downey stores. 
</P>
<P>
During their most recent day-before-Christmas visit, the Canalettis browsed 
through the jewelry stores and Bill made it a point to check out the toys for 
grown-ups at Brookstone Co. "We've already done all our shopping," said Bill. 
"But if we see something special, we buy it for each other," Mary added. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to visitors such as the Canalettis, the Beverly Center draws 
customers from some of the most affluent areas in Los Angeles County. It serves 
almost as a trolley stop for browsers between Beverly Hills and Melrose Avenue. 
Mall officials like to say the center is between Melrose and Rodeo Drive in 
both geography and tone. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when the trend among malls is to differentiate, the Beverly Center 
has retained a strong image as a high-end shopping center. It recently opened a 
Conran's furniture outlet to add to its department store anchors, Bullock's and 
The Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Owned and operated by La Cienega Associates and managed by the Taubman Co., the 
Beverly Center in 1989 ranked seventh in total sales out of the 45 largest 
malls in Los Angeles County.

The federal government boasted today that it has sent states nearly $4.5 
billion in anti-drug block grants since 1987 and claimed victory in unplugging 
obstacles that have delayed the flow of money to states. 
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. Conference of Mayors was unimpressed with the report by the 
Office of National Drug Control Policy, contending the money is not making its 
way to local governments, which are bearing the violent brunt of the drug 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The report's preliminary estimates show that for fiscal year 1991, California 
will reap the most from the three block grants -- $160.5 million and a 115% 
increase over the amount it received in 1989. Wyoming will receive the least 
amount among the 50 states, $4.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
The grants are for law enforcement efforts, distributed by the Justice 
Department; treatment, distributed by the Department of Health and Human 
Services; and prevention, distributed by the Departments of Education and 
Health and Human Services.

Mayor Art Agnos today signed the nation's strictest law regulating video 
display terminal use by workers, despite a political rival's last-minute 
charges that the ordinance is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The law requires 15-minute breaks and other safety measures, including proper 
lighting, anti-glare screens and adjustable furniture and equipment for VDT 
users. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Hsieh, a city supervisor opposing the measure, charged Wednesday that the 
ordinance violates the city charter. But Jonathan Holtzman, special assistant 
in the city attorney's office, said it clearly does not. 
</P>
<P>
"I am gravely concerned that the city is about to enact a law that is extremely 
vulnerable to legal challenge," Hsieh said. 
</P>
<P>
Hsieh said a section of the city charter mandates that supervisors can't make 
changes in working conditions for city employees until the city's civil service 
commission makes various studies. But Holtzman said the section cited by Hsieh 
applies only to changes in their pay. 
</P>
<P>
The law is to take effect in 30 days. It applies to employees of private 
businesses and city workers. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the ordinance said the law would be so costly -- an estimated $36 
million to about $70 million citywide -- that it could drive some business 
away.

President Bush today said officials should stop talking about the readiness of 
U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf, but he did not directly deny reports that the 
force will not be prepared for offensive action on Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be very useful if from the President and others there were 
fewer comments about readiness. . . . There's been enough said about 
readiness," Bush said, showing a touch of irritation at news accounts saying 
military officials have warned him that the U.S. troops will not be prepared by 
mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has given Iraq until Jan. 15 to withdraw its occupying 
troops from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
He said that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made a report to him after their trip to the gulf 
that was "quite different than most stories I've been reading in the last few 
days." 
</P>
<P>
Bush made the comments to reporters as he departed by helicopter to resume his 
holiday vacation at Camp David, Md., after a morning visit to the White House 
that included a meeting with the Soviet ambassador to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
While avoiding direct comment on the issue of readiness, Bush said: "I read one 
report about what Powell and Cheney told me and it was 180 degrees wrong." He 
declined to say what report. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of false leads out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also said there would be "no compromise" with Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein on a date to meet with Secretary of State James A. Baker III and 
discuss a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who interrupted his Camp David vacation for several hours of White House 
work, also met with Soviet Ambassador Alexander Bessmertnykh. The diplomat 
delivered a letter from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Aides said they 
did not know the content of the message, which came as the Soviet Union is 
embroiled in domestic political turmoil.

A man who fled to Italy after allegedly feeding drug-laced spaghetti to two 
women and then sexually assaulting them pleaded guilty today to felony sex 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Nicola Iannone, 35, submitted his plea in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court to 
two charges of gross sexual imposition. 
</P>
<P>
He then was returned to the jail to be held without bond pending his Jan. 24 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the plea bargain, prosecutors dropped six other charges against him, 
including charges stemming from an alleged, similar incident in October, 1987. 
The victim in that case had moved out of state and could not be located. 
</P>
<P>
Iannone's victims alleged that he came to their Cincinnati apartment and fed 
them a pasta dinner and that they woke up the next day with their clothes off. 
The charges to which Iannone pleaded guilty alleged that he had sexual contact 
with both victims and gave them drugs, either by force or deception. 
</P>
<P>
Iannone, an Italian-born naturalized U.S. citizen, worked as a restaurant 
consultant in Cincinnati and Chicago. He faces up to 1 1/2 years in prison on 
each of the two counts.

Prosecutors formally charged a former Cabinet minister with fraud today in the 
latest scandal to hit Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party. 
</P>
<P>
Former Environment Minister Toshiyuki Inamura was charged with evading tax 
totaling $12.5 million on profits he made in association with Mitsuhiro Kotani, 
a flamboyant speculator and corporate raider arrested in June and accused of 
manipulating stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Prosecutor Yusuke Yoshinaga said Inamura made as much as $20 million in 
stock deals between 1986 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Inamura, who served in former Premier Yasuhiro Nakasone's Cabinet in 1986-87, 
resigned his party membership Wednesday. Nakasone resigned from the LDP last 
year for his involvement in the Recruit influence-peddling scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Inamura is expected to retain his parliamentary seat, as did Nakasone and his 
right-hand man, Takao Fujinami. Fujinami is the only LDP member to be charged 
in the Recruit scandal.

Getting deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega to and from the federal 
courthouse from his jail cell 24 miles away has cost taxpayers $363,694 since 
January, when he arrived in south Florida from Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Officials attributed the high tab to the "extraordinary costs of security 
details" needed. 
</P>
<P>
The $363,000-plus transportation bill, which was obtained by the Miami Herald 
through a Freedom of Information Act request, included the cost of Noriega's 
removal from Panama to Homestead Air Force Base aboard a C-130 military 
airplane. 
</P>
<P>
The transportation figure does not include the expense of housing, feeding or 
clothing the former dictator, who was brought to Florida to stand trial on 
drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges after the December, 1989, U.S. 
invasion of Panama.

Japan's current account trade surplus plunged 57% in November, the government 
said today, as the price of imported oil soared and Japanese tourists spent 
more abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The current account surplus -- the broadest measure of trade in goods and 
services -- narrowed to $1.75 billion in November from $4.11 billion a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In October it was $2.73 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The rise in oil prices . . . has boosted the value of imports for several 
months now," said Kusuo Aoki, economist at Yamaichi Research Institute. "It's 
almost a pattern." 
</P>
<P>
The non-trade, or "invisibles" account, swung sharply into a deficit of $2.5 
billion from a surplus of $261 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This should mostly be the larger number of Japanese tourists going abroad," 
Aoki said. "But it's not that there are that many more travelers. It's because 
those travelers are spending more money overseas."

'BIG TICKET' ITEM ORDERS PLUNGE 10.5%; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: NOVEMBER'S DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR DURABLE GOODS IS 'THE FINAL NAIL IN 
THE "NO-RECESSION" COFFIN,' ONE ANALYST SAYS.

Orders to U.S. factories for "big ticket" durable goods plunged 10.5% in 
November to the lowest level in 2 1/2 years, the government said today. 
</P>
<P>
The decline matched the post-1958 record for one month set in January of this 
year and indicates that the recession most economists believe started this fall 
is deepening. 
</P>
<P>
The drop likely is a harbinger of further layoffs at manufacturing plants, 
where payrolls have shrunk by 800,000 jobs over the last two years -- 200,000 
in November alone. 
</P>
<P>
Order declines were widespread, but were biggest in the transportation and 
defense industries. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is the final nail in the 'no-recession' coffin. This series had 
been hanging up there nicely and had been refusing to give ground. It had been 
one of the things optimists pointed to and now it's gone," said Robert 
Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a precipitous decline indicative of a U.S. economy that is ending 1990 on 
a very harsh note," said economist Stephen S. Roach of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. 
"I think the manufacturing sector right now is in the worst of the recession." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, orders for durable goods -- items from bicycles to battleships and 
expected to last three or more years -- totaled a seasonally adjusted $115.9 
billion last month. That was the lowest since May, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Orders had risen 3.6% in October, but have been down in six of 11 months so far 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation orders fell 27.4% in November. That included a drop of 38.8% in 
aircraft and parts, more than offsetting October's 20.4% increase. Boeing Co. 
earlier reported new orders of $5.2 billion, down from $10.7 billion a month 
earlier. Automobile and parts orders also fell.

An electrical transformer exploded early today in the Wall Street district, 
setting off a fire and delaying trading on the two major stock exchanges for 90 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Flames shot eight stories high after the transformer blew up beneath the 
sidewalk outside the 54-story building that houses the stock markets' computer 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Between 100 and 200 late-night office workers fled the building into freezing 
temperatures after the pre-dawn explosion. 
</P>
<P>
Trading on the New York and American Stock Exchanges, which usually open at 
9:30 a.m. EST, did not begin until 11 a.m. after preliminary test results found 
no signs of PCB contamination in the building housing the Securities Industry 
Automation Corp., the computer center serving both exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission asked all outside stock exchanges to 
delay opening until SIAC computers were back in service so that all "market 
participants have access to the same information." 
</P>
<P>
Forty people, including more than two dozen firefighters, were treated for 
possible exposure to deadly PCBs. Four of the firefighters were hospitalized 
and the others took decontamination showers using a special unit brought to the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
A Consolidated Edison spokeswoman said the cause of the fire was under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Trading disruptions are relatively rare. More than a year ago, trading on the 
NYSE was halted when a fire-related power problem at SIAC briefly delayed the 
opening one day. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a power failure disrupted trading on the NYSE for 90 minutes. The 
exchange shut down 11 minutes after the opening bell on Nov. 23 and resumed 
later that morning. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-August, a fire at a Con Edison power substation forced the American 
Stock Exchange, New York Mercantile Exchange and other futures markets in 
southern Manhattan to close by early afternoon.

A federal judge today ruled that provisions of Indiana's new law regulating 
out-of-state trash are unconstitutional, saying the flow of rubbish into the 
state is all part of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge John D. Tinder concluded that the law's three key 
provisions violate the Constitution's commerce clause that allows free trade 
among the states. 
</P>
<P>
"However noble and popular these three provisions of House Enrolled Act 1240 
appear to be, they must give way to the constitutional principles," Tinder 
wrote. The same protection that the commerce clause gives to the citizens of 
other states who feel the need to (export) waste into Indiana protects Indiana 
citizens when they export hazardous waste to other states. "Commerce, even in 
such 'bads' as waste, is a two-way street," he wrote.

French sailor Isabelle Autissier finished the second leg of the BOC Around The 
World solo yacht race today despite breaking a mast in Bass Strait, 600 
nautical miles south of Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
Autissier, 36, the only woman in the 21-yacht fleet for the 27,000 
nautical-mile race, finished the leg in 11th place. 
</P>
<P>
Autissier, sailing Ecureuil Poitou Charente, said she never had doubted she 
would finish the leg from Cape Town, South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sure to be here in Sydney," Autissier said after her 32-day journey. "I 
have two masts on my boat so you can always do something to go on." 
</P>
<P>
She estimated loss of the mast cost her three days sailing time. She was in 
sixth place at the time of the failure. 
</P>
<P>
South African John Martin, sailing Allied Bank, won the second leg of the race 
and is the overall leader.

If the National Football League really is serious about civil rights and racial 
issues, it should force the Washington Redskins to pick a new team name, the 
president of a Phoenix Bible college says. 
</P>
<P>
"If the NFL were really motivated by ethnic concerns, why would they have a 
team called the Redskins?" asks Dave Moore, president of the American Indian 
Bible College. 
</P>
<P>
"What if some other team came into the league and decided to call themselves 
the Blackskins or the Yellowskins?" 
</P>
<P>
Moore wrote to NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, asking the league to find a new 
name for the Redskins in light of the NFL's threat to pull the 1993 Super Bowl 
out of Arizona because voters rejected a paid Martin Luther King holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Both NFL and Redskins officials brushed off the suggestion, saying they have no 
intention of changing the name because it is "a tradition." 
</P>
<P>
"Team nicknames often are a celebration of American folklore," NFL spokesman 
Greg Aiello said.

Shane Foley, a backup quarterback for the USC Trojans, was arrested early on 
Christmas Eve on a public intoxication charge after he allegedly kicked a 
window on a taxi cab without provocation, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Foley and the rest of the USC team are currently in El Paso, Texas, preparing 
for the John Hancock Bowl on Monday against Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
USC coach Larry Smith said today that as a result of the incident, Foley will 
not start in the game and is confined to the team hotel. Smith said that if 
Foley breaks any team rules he will be sent home. 
</P>
<P>
There had been a chance that Foley would have started against Michigan State 
because Todd Marinovich has been battling an ear infection. 
</P>
<P>
Foley, 22, a former star player at Newport Harbor High School, allegedly 
emerged from the Village Inn on Marine Avenue on Balboa Island along with a 
former Loyola Marymount University basketball player, walked up to the cab and 
kicked at it repeatedly, said police Lt. Tim Newman. 
</P>
<P>
The quarterback was arrested at 2:30 a.m. Monday by a police officer who 
"smelled a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage on the breath and person of Mr. 
Foley," according to the police report. Foley spent six hours in custody before 
he was released on his own recognizance, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
Police reports stated that Foley came out of the Village Inn at 2:15 a.m. along 
with Jeff Fryer -- a former point guard for Corona del Mar High School and 
Loyola Marymount -- and a woman identified as Elizabeth Clock and approached a 
cab driven by Robert Excell of Fountain Valley. Foley then allegedly kicked the 
cab's right rear window repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
"When asked about the taxi incident, (Foley) said he kicked the taxi window, 
but he couldn't tell the (arresting) officer why," Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
Foley then left the scene in a car driven by Clock, who Newman said met Foley 
in the bar and agreed to drive him and Fryer to a friend's house. Police 
stopped the car several blocks away and Excell identified Foley, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Clock nor Fryer was charged in the incident. Excell declined to press 
charges against Foley, Newman said.

His separated right shoulder feels much better, and he wants a second opinion

Coach Jimmy Johnson, however, still expects to place Aikman on injured reserve 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman, who was hurt in Sunday's loss at Philadelphia, put off a decision 
Wednesday regarding surgery because he said the pain and swelling in the 
shoulder had subsided and its mobility had increased. Aikman wants to get more 
medical opinions and be certain there are not other alternatives before 
agreeing to surgery.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: NO MIRACLE DRUG, BUT CLOZARIL MAY HELP SCHIZOPHRENIC SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON and TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: My 23-year-old son suffers from schizophrenia. After living on the 
streets like a bum, he finally agreed to move into a residential treatment 
center. They have him on Haldol, but he is often restless and confused and 
frequently complains of blurred vision. 
</P>
<P>
We've read about a new medication for schizophrenia called Clozaril. It's very 
expensive, but we would be willing to make the sacrifice if it were a 
breakthrough against this awful disease. Is this drug worth the price? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Clozaril (clozapine) has been available in Europe for almost 20 years 
but has recently been approved in the United States. It is unlikely to cause 
the uncontrollable muscle twitching (tardive dyskinesia) often brought on by 
traditional schizophrenia medications. 
</P>
<P>
This new drug is no miracle breakthrough. It can help some schizophrenics who 
have not responded well to other medicine, but it may cause drowsiness, 
drooling, constipation, blood pressure problems or seizures. 
</P>
<P>
Of far greater concern is a potentially life-threatening blood disorder that 
occurs in one or two patients out of 100. For this reason the company requires 
weekly blood tests, and the combination of medicine and monitoring can bring 
the price to almost $9,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
The price may drop if a new testing program is developed. This may make the 
medicine affordable, but your son's doctor is the best judge of whether he 
could benefit from Clozaril. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I read your article on bedwetting and a medicine that has been developed for 
children. I myself am a bedwetter of 33 years. This has caused me to shy away 
from sleeping over, having others to sleep over, or enjoying any kind of 
intimate relationship. 
</P>
<P>
I am afraid to go to a doctor with this problem because of shame. Is there any 
hope at all for an old lady like me? 
</P>
<P>
A. You bet, but you need to screw up your courage and see a physician. We 
promise that a urologist will not be surprised to hear about your problem and 
will treat you with sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor will determine the cause of your difficulty. Minor surgery may be 
the best approach, or the new drug you read about might turn your life around. 
DDAVP (desmopressin) works for adults as well as children. The nasal spray can 
effectively control nighttime urine production.

The two-story building in the city's Kensington section was occupied by the

<P>
At the time of the "Rocky" filming, it was owned by Cross Brothers Meat Packing

LIZ SMITH: HEARST JR. TO REPORT ON FAMILY DYNASTY IN NEW BOOK

TNT BROADCASTING celebrated Christmas Day by running the epic Orson Welles 
movie "Citizen Kane," which sent those of us who remember the late William 
Randolph Hearst Sr. running back down memory lane. (The movie was said to be 
based on Hearst's life.) 
</P>
<P>
Now comes word that William Randolph Hearst Jr. is writing a revealing insider 
account of the Hearst dynasty, to be titled "The Hearsts: Father and Son," 
coming from Roberts Rinehart Inc. in August, 1991. Publication will coincide 
with the 40th anniversary of Hearst Sr.'s death. 
</P>
<P>
Hearst Jr. will not only write about his rags-to-riches grandparents, George 
and Phoebe Hearst, who struck it rich in gold, silver and copper out West, but 
the remarkable newspaper empire built by his famous dad. And he will tell how 
he and his four brothers grew up in the shadow of their father's genius. 
</P>
<P>
The book will be studded with colorful anecdotes about Winston Churchill, 
Konrad Adenauer, Jawaharlal Nehru, Margaret Thatcher and almost every American 
President of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Hearst Jr. selected Rinehart as his publisher because of the company's long 
publishing history, beginning with George Doran in the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Rinehart has its fingers crossed that "The Hearsts: Father and Son" will become 
a new "Anthony Adverse." (That was the novel that became the first best seller 
of the decade of the '30s.) 
</P>
<P>
SHOULD (God forbid) the U.S. and Israel become entwined in some kind of joint 
defensive conflict in the Middle East, we don't have to worry about our 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff "communicating." Gen. Colin L. Powell 
speaks fluent Yiddish, learned from a South Bronx shopkeeper when he was a 
child.

Brigitte Bardot, French cinema's best-known sex symbol, said today that she 
would not care if all but one of her dozens of films disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything I appeared in during that period can disappear forever; I couldn't 
care less," Bardot, 55, told the newspaper Liberation in a rare interview. 
</P>
<P>
"If only one trace of my passage on screen remained, I wish it was in 'La 
Verite' (The Truth) . . . where I truly felt I was a real actress," said 
Bardot, now a leading animal rights campaigner. 
</P>
<P>
Filmed in 1960 by Henri-Georges Clouzot, "La Verite" portrayed a real incident 
in which a young Frenchwoman murdered her lover. It won an Oscar for best 
foreign film. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, the cinema is linked to such confusion in my (personal) life that I 
never wish to hear about it again and, obviously, never want to act again," 
said Bardot, whose last screen appearance was in 1973.

BARR'S HUSBAND SUES HER EX

Roseanne Barr's husband wants a gag to work -- one from a court, not from her 
hit TV show. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Arnold filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Superior Court charging that Barr's 
former husband and his attorney violated a court order by discussing the 
comic's divorce publicly. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said ex-husband William Pentland and his attorney, palimony lawyer 
Marvin Mitchelson, discussed the divorce on the "Donahue" show in November. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold's lawyer, Martin Singer, asked a judge to sentence Mitchelson to 30 days 
in jail and Pentland to 15 days for contempt of court. Singer said Mitchelson 
"has engaged in a widespread publicity campaign to try to maliciously disparage 
and defame Tom Arnold in direct violation of the order." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchelson said he would file a countersuit, saying it was Barr who called into 
"Donahue" and discussed the divorce. She also made disparaging remarks about 
the divorce on Arsenio Hall's talk show, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pentland, who was married for 14 years to Barr, filed a palimony lawsuit in 
August seeking at least $15 million from her and $3 million from Arnold.

Stock prices drifted lower today in a session delayed by problems that resulted 
from an overnight fire at a financial-district building. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 11.63 points at 2,625.50. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a modest 102.9 million shares, with 
the start of trading delayed 90 minutes. Losing issues outnumbered gainers by 
about 3 to 2. 
</P>
<P>
The fire may have slowed reaction to poor economic data. 
</P>
<P>
The government reported that durable goods orders in November fell a sharp 
10.5%. Economists had predicted a 3.1% decline. 
</P>
<P>
"The delay gave us a chance to do a more sensible and less rushed analysis of 
the (economic) data," said one analyst who thought today's decline might have 
been deeper. "It lessened the chances of an emotional response." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Bloch, chief technical analyst at Raymond, James &amp; Associates, said 
concern over fourth-quarter corporate profits was also rising. 
</P>
<P>
"That can keep the market on edge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Losers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down 
1/4 at 30 an hour before the close; General Electric, down 1/8 at 57 1/4, and 
General Motors, down 3/8 at 34 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany &amp; Co. fell 2 3/8 to 34 7/8 on top of a 4 3/8-point loss Wednesday, 
when the company said its holiday sales in the United States came in below 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices jumped in thin trading early today as traders responded to the 
government report on durable goods. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was up 13/32 point, or $4.06 per $1,000 
in face amount, around midday. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, dropped 
to 8.24% from 8.28% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest banks pay each other on temporary loans, 
gyrated amid what analysts said were end-of-the-year moves by banks that 
reduced the availability of federal funds.
