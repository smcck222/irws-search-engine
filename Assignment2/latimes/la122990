A PARK'S PREVIOUS LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
POPULAR VENTURA SITE BEARS FEW REMINDERS OF FORMER CEMETERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's one of the most popular parks in town for walking, jogging, throwing 
Frisbees, relaxing, enjoying a spectacular panorama of the Pacific Ocean and 
the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
It's seven acres in the heart of Ventura, an oasis of manicured lush green 
lawns, stately pine and pepper trees. 
</P>
<P>
But this is not your typical green space in an urban setting. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the park's surface are the remains of 3,322 Ventura County residents 
who died between 1842 and 1944. 
</P>
<P>
Cemetery Park is a cemetery that became a city park. 
</P>
<P>
All the tombstones were removed in 1968 and 1969 when the transformation 
occurred. But the bodies were left undisturbed and some small grave markers 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
No signs proclaim: "Cemetery Park." It's just there. Out-of-towners and many 
residents who moved here during the past 20 years are unaware the park was a 
cemetery for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
Baltazar Lopez, wife Annette, and their children, Veronica, 2, and Bryon, 1, 
had their picnic lunch spread out on a blanket. They live in Ventura but didn't 
know the history of the park. When informed of its previous use, Annette Lopez 
remarked: 
</P>
<P>
"That's pretty scary. I wonder who we're sitting on . . . ?" 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Rumsey and Melanie Allred, both 16 and Ventura High School juniors, were 
at the park on a lunch break. They sat on the grass near two flat small bronze 
markers at two burial sites. They know the park is also a cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's great. You really can't tell it's a cemetery. There are a few of 
these markers scattered around. But most people I've talked to in the park are 
unaware people are buried here," Rumsey said. 
</P>
<P>
Four joggers dashed by, running from one end of the park to the other. Waitress 
Patty Trischler, 31, led her schnauzer through the park on a leash. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Romero, 59, of the Ventura Parks and Recreation Department, is one of the 
groundskeepers at Cemetery Park. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very unusual situation," said Romero, with the department 34 years. 
"The cemetery had been an eyesore for a long time. It was full of weeds. 
Headstones were toppled. 
</P>
<P>
"There hadn't been any burials here since World War II. Finally, the city 
removed the headstones, cleaned the place up and made a park out of the 
cemetery. My wife's sister, Eleanor Garcia who died when she was 15, is buried 
here." 
</P>
<P>
When the park was created, headstones were presented to relatives who requested 
them. Those not claimed were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
At first the city planned to erect a bronze plaque listing in alphabetical 
order the names of everyone buried in the cemetery. But that was not done. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago the city decided to place a small flat bronze marker without 
charge at the request of relatives over burial sites. Only 33 of the markers 
have been requested and installed so far. 
</P>
<P>
"Every now and then someone from out of town comes into City Hall asking what 
happened to the old cemetery. They're usually looking for the grave of a 
long-deceased relative," City Clerk Barbara Kam said. 
</P>
<P>
This summer a dozen men dressed in Civil War uniforms came to the park and 
fired 21 gun salutes at the dedication of two markers, one to the memory of 
Congressional Medal of Honor winner James Sumner, the other to Brig. Gen. 
William Vandever. 
</P>
<P>
Sumner was awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism when he was wounded while an 
Army private in a battle with Indians in Arizona in 1869. The final years of 
his life were spent working in an Oxnard saloon. He died in the Ventura County 
Poorhouse in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
Vandever was a Union general in the Civil War and a congressman from Ventura 
from 1887-1891. He died in 1893. 
</P>
<P>
Several people in the park the day the two markers were dedicated called the 
Police Department asking why a bunch of men in old-fashioned uniforms kept 
firing guns into the air.

SUSPECT IN KILLING OF NORTHRIDGE BOY IS CHARGED WITH MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County prosecutors on Friday filed sexual molestation charges against a 
former day-care worker who is also charged with kidnaping and killing an 
8-year-old Northridge boy found gagged and burned beyond recognition in a field 
near Simi Valley in March. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Scott Smith, who is being held without bail in Ventura County Jail, 
will be arraigned Wednesday on the two sexual molestation charges. Facing 
combined charges of kidnaping and first-degree murder, Smith, 23, of Canoga 
Park, could be sentenced to death if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
A mistrial in the case was declared two weeks ago when Smith's public defenders 
said they also represented a jailhouse informant who is serving as a key 
prosecution witness in the case. A new trial is expected to start in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
County prosecutors on Friday revealed very little about what led them to file 
the new charges. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris said that it is a 
"logical conclusion" that information provided by the informant prompted the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege that Smith killed Paul Bailly while forcibly molesting him. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's attorneys could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Ventura County coroner's office, the boy suffocated on his own 
vomit while his mouth was gagged. A bruise on the back of his neck also 
indicated that he may have been strangled. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. F. Warren Lovell, the county coroner, ruled that Paul was dead when his 
body was set afire because there was no soot in the boy's nose or windpipe and 
no carbon monoxide in his blood. 
</P>
<P>
After an initial analysis, the coroner had said there was no evidence of sexual 
assault. But he added that investigators were conducting further tests. The 
coroner's report was sealed after the investigation was completed. 
</P>
<P>
Paul disappeared March 23 after his mother dropped him off at the day-care 
program at Darby Avenue Elementary School in Northridge, where Smith worked. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters found his charred body that afternoon when summoned to extinguish 
a brush fire in the Santa Susana Knolls area south of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Ventura homicide investigators arrested Smith.

SHERIFF ASKS DISASTER DECLARATION FOR COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
FREEZE: CROP LOSSES MAY REACH $100 MILLION, AGRICULTURE OFFICIALS SAY, WITH 
LEMON ORCHARDS ALONE TOTALING $38 MILLION IN FRUIT DESTROYED BY COLD. 
</P>

<P>
Acting in his role as director of disaster services, Sheriff John Gillespie 
declared Ventura County a disaster area Friday, the first step to obtaining 
emergency federal loans for area growers devastated by last weekend's deep 
freeze. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors have tentatively scheduled a special session for Thursday to 
ratify the declaration, officials said. The declaration will then be sent to 
Sacramento where the governor will decide whether to forward the request for 
low-interest disaster relief loans to the federal government. Ten other 
counties are also considering declaring an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
"Since agriculture is the No. 1 industry in Ventura County, this is truly a 
disaster," Gillespie said Friday. "It's as disastrous as if the county had 
burnt from wildfire or flooded." 
</P>
<P>
In preliminary estimates, agriculture officials set the loss to county crops at 
nearly $100 million, with the county's valuable lemon orchards suffering the 
brunt at $38 million in lost fruit. 
</P>
<P>
In other figures released Friday, agricultural officials estimated a 
$17.5-million loss of avocados, or about 32% of the county's crop; a 
$16.5-million loss of Valencia oranges, or about 27% of the crop; a $7-million 
loss of nursery stock, about 7.5% of the crop; a $4-million loss in 
strawberries, 5% of the crop; a $4-million loss of celery, about 5% of the 
crop; and a $2.5-million loss in cut flowers, about 10% of the crop. 
</P>
<P>
With another freeze expected to plunge temperatures into the mid- to low 20s 
tonight and Sunday night, losses may continue to climb, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A second Arctic air mass was expected to arrive late today, said National 
Weather Service agricultural meteorologist Terry Schaeffer. If the cold spots 
are restricted to the same inland areas of Ojai and Santa Paula that have 
already lost fruit, losses this weekend could be held to a minimum, Schaeffer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some areas did better than others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Schaeffer predicted that the extremely cold mass that he earlier had feared 
would move into Ventura County tonight will deliver only a "glancing blow" to 
the county before veering off to the agriculturally rich San Joaquin Valley 
that has already measured $75 million in damage to citrus crops alone. 
</P>
<P>
Total losses to this year's crops will not be known for another few months when 
growers determine how much of their young fruit is salvageable, said Deputy 
Agriculture Commissioner David Buettner. Growers say it will be two to three 
years before they can measure the long-term damage to trees, damage which will 
result in lower crop yields. 
</P>
<P>
The county's vegetable and other row crops, which lost only about 5% of their 
total value, fared better than citrus and avocados because the growing fields 
are in slightly warmer areas, Buettner said. In addition, many vegetable and 
row crops produce several harvests a year, with last weekend's freeze having 
little or no impact on future crops. 
</P>
<P>
The areas hardest hit by the freeze were in canyons near Santa Paula and the 
Ojai Valley, where a stagnant and frigid air mass settled on some of the 
county's richest citrus and avocado orchards. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard Plain, where much of the county's broccoli, lettuce, celery and 
other row crops are cultivated, was spared the harshest temperatures, Buettner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry growers will lose most of the berries on plants that were already 
flowering, Buettner said, but that represents only about 5% of the total 
strawberry crop. The county produces berries from January through July. 
</P>
<P>
Cut flowers, many of them grown in the Oxnard Plain and the Santa Clara River 
Valley which was also spared the hard freeze, suffered 10% loss, but baby's 
breath fields were about 95% destroyed, Buettner said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very susceptible to frost damage, so it won't be back until Valentine's 
Day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most nursery stock growers were able to protect their sensitive plants, he 
said, but the county's $94-million-a-year industry still suffered a 7.5% loss, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Friday marked the second time in three years that Ventura County has declared a 
disaster because of frost damage. 
</P>
<P>
The county suffered more than $51 million in crop damage in 1987, Buettner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another 10 counties statewide were preparing to declare emergencies, said Joe 
Bandy, regional coordinator for the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture in Sacramento.

4 WHO REPORTED AVOCADO THEFTS GET REWARD MONEY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Four Ventura County residents collected rewards totaling $1,700 for tipping 
police to avocado thieves in two Somis incidents, an industry spokesman said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The rewards were given by the California Avocado Commission as part of its 
$775,000 statewide anti-theft program. 
</P>
<P>
This year, $30,000 of the program's funds are designated for rewards. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases, ranch workers had investigated cars parked near avocado groves 
when they discovered unauthorized men picking the pricey fruit. 
</P>
<P>
The workers alerted Ventura County sheriff's deputies, who arrested the 
suspects. The arrests resulted in the recovery of 4,150 pounds of avocados. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the commission estimated that $1 million to $2 million in 
avocados are stolen from Ventura growers each year. 
</P>
<P>
Five other rewards have been collected in Ventura County since the avocado 
commission started its program in February -- two in Camarillo and three in 
Fillmore. JOEL BRAND

TRANSIT DIRECTORS TO DISCUSS CONFERENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERRY BRAILO SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the board of directors of South Coast Area Transit will consider 
Wednesday whether to allow its members to attend several out-of-state 
conferences next year, including one scheduled for Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Councilman John McWherter, who represents Ventura on the SCAT board, 
said attendance at the American Public Transit Association conferences are 
essential for members to keep up on pressing public transportation issues. 
</P>
<P>
"We are all city councilmen or mayors and we don't spend much time studying 
SCAT -- not nearly as much as we do our cities," McWherter said. Board members, 
he said, "bring back information to help run the district so we are not 
continually reinventing the wheel." 
</P>
<P>
The conferences are scheduled for Washington, D.C., in March, Austin, Tex., in 
April, and Toronto in the fall. Mel Chambers, SCAT's director of administrative 
services, said the agency has set aside $40,000 to pay for conference-related 
expenses for board officers and executive staff. 
</P>
<P>
As western Ventura County's public transit agency, SCAT runs bus lines in 
Oxnard, Ventura, Ojai, Santa Paula, Port Hueneme, and surrounding areas of 
unincorporated Ventura County. The cities and county jointly finance the 
agency. SCAT also receives state and federal mass-transit dollars. 
</P>
<P>
SCAT board directors have their votes weighted in proportion to the amount of 
money their city donates. Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi, for example, commands 42% 
of the vote because his city contributes the largest chunk of SCAT's budget. 
</P>
<P>
McWherter has the second most influential vote -- 39% -- because Ventura 
contributes the second largest amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
McWherter said the transportation conferences often provide a crash-course in 
managing public transit agencies. 
</P>
<P>
"We learn about routes, about operations of buses, the types of things other 
districts have tried . . . I feel we are more knowledgeable and save the 
district hundreds of thousands of dollars, even if we spend several thousand 
dollars to attend," McWherter said. GERRY BRAILO SPENCER

The Thousand Oaks Library will use a $26,500 grant from the California State 
Library to deliver books to senior citizens and disabled people who cannot 
visit the library. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers will start the service in late January, said Norma Callero, grants 
and volunteer coordinator. During the first stages of the program, about 20 
volunteers will be needed to help 30 to 40 patrons, Callero said. 
</P>
<P>
The grant money will also be used to buy large-print materials, books on tapes, 
and magnifying equipment and videotapes. The library will present a series of 
programs targeting the concerns of older adults, such as retirement, health and 
financial management. MAJA RADEVICH

SATICOY WALNUT WAREHOUSE RODE A BOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
HISTORY: In 1919, the Saticoy Walnut Growers Assn. responded to expansion of 
walnut production in Ventura County by building a warehouse from which locally 
grown nuts could be sent to market. The warehouse was expanded in 1921 and 
continued to be used until 1962, when walnut growing declined in the area. The 
building was sold and now serves 
</P>
<P>
other purposes.

* LOCATION: The warehouse is located at 1235-1255 Wells Road in Saticoy. To the 
southeast is the Southern Pacific railroad main track, to the northwest is 
Telephone Road. 
</P>
<P>
* VIEWING: Contact the county Cultural Heritage Board at 654-3967 to arrange a 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the 19th Century, Ventura County began to emerge as a walnut production 
center. In 1896, the Saticoy Walnut Growers Assn. was formed by five landowners 
and farmers from Saticoy and Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
In 1919, the association built a warehouse in Saticoy, where walnuts could be 
processed and shipped to market on the Southern Pacific railroad. 
</P>
<P>
The nuts were washed and bleached to remove dirt and stains and then laid out 
to dry in the sun. In the 1920s, local resident Eugene Kimball designed and 
built a dehydrator to dry the walnuts with greatly reduced losses. 
</P>
<P>
Workers were hired seasonally -- women to look for imperfections in the nuts 
and determine quality, men to load the sacks onto railroad cars and later onto 
trucks. The nuts were shipped to Los Angeles where they were shelled. 
</P>
<P>
The warehouse has an irregular shape. The main part of the building stands 1 
1/2 stories high, is 80 feet wide and 200 feet long with a gable roof supported 
by heavy triangular wood trusses. 
</P>
<P>
In 1921, the southerly part of the building was added. Also gable-roofed, it is 
three stories high and sits at a 90-degree angle to the main section. A 
one-story annex extends west from the taller section. Horizontal wood siding 
covers the entire building. 
</P>
<P>
Charles C. Teague of Santa Paula, a past president of the Walnut Growers Assn. 
and active in citrus growing as well, was appointed in the early 1930s by 
President Herbert Hoover to the Federal Farm Board. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Sharp, grandson of a founder of the association and son of a past 
president, redesigned and rebuilt the old processing equipment in the 1950s. An 
electrical engineer, Sharp added a vacuum for empty shells and infrared heat 
lamps for faster drying. 
</P>
<P>
At the peak of the industry, around 1956-57, 6,000 tons of nuts passed through 
the warehouse each year. At that time, it was the largest walnut facility in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
By 1962, production had fallen to 880 tons. "The crops had shrunk so much we 
dissolved the co-op, sold the equipment and land," Sharp said. 'We couldn't 
compete with Central California." 
</P>
<P>
Many local farmers had begun growing citrus and avocados, which were more 
profitable, he said. CAROL WEINSTOCK

PEACE ACTIVISTS URGE BERMAN TO TAKE STAND; 
</P>
<P>
MIDDLE EAST: MARCHING OUTSIDE THE CONGRESSMAN'S VALLEY OFFICE, A COALITION OF 
ANTI-WAR PROTESTERS CONDEMNS HIS SILENCE ON MILITARY INTERVENTION IN IRAQ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
About 50 anti-war protesters, many of them senior citizens, marched outside 
Rep. Howard L. Berman's San Fernando Valley office for nearly two hours Friday 
afternoon, calling for negotiations instead of war in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Although Berman (D-Panorama City) has consistently supported economic sanctions 
against Iraq as the first line of defense, representatives of the protest group 
said his failure to publicly condemn going to war against Iraq amounts to 
condoning it. 
</P>
<P>
"His failure to take a position really indicates a position," said Gary Lipton, 
senior assemblyman with the California Senior Legislature. "The appalling 
silence is unbelievable to me." 
</P>
<P>
Berman -- who was en route to Washington, D.C., and unavailable for comment 
Friday -- has said in the past that he would not rule out low-level military 
intervention if sanctions did not work. During an interview in September, he 
said he feared that, if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's offensive capability 
were not throttled, the United States would face an increasingly fortified foe. 
</P>
<P>
Lipton and others said they want Berman to support legislation proposed by Rep. 
Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) that would give economic sanctions against Iraq at 
least a year to work before more drastic action is taken. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters identified themselves as the newly formed Peace Coalition, which 
has drawn members from such groups as the Gray Panthers, Beyond War, the county 
Democratic Party and the Unitarian-Universalist Church. 
</P>
<P>
They said they would continue their protests with visits to other San Fernando 
Valley representatives in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with some of the group's representatives, Berman's chief 
district aide -- Fausto Capobianco -- said he would see that Berman received 
the group's message as soon as he landed in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Howard has an ongoing concern in this area," Capobianco said. "But not 
only did we not discuss it when he was here, I don't know what he is thinking 
on the situation at all." 
</P>
<P>
Coalition leader Jo Seidita, prefacing her remarks by saying she didn't "want 
to sound rude or pushy," told Capobianco that she was disturbed by his response 
and that of spokesmen for other Valley congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm somewhat overwhelmed to hear chief aides don't know where their 
congressmen stand on this," she said. "It's astonishing." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the protesters were veteran peace marchers, having participated in 
anti-war efforts during the Vietnam War. But they said anti-war sentiment is 
far more widespread today than it was then. 
</P>
<P>
"I was considered almost an enemy of the Democratic Party then," Seidita said. 
"Now people are much more alert, much more aware, much more concerned."

CON MAN ACCUSED IN STOCK SCHEME THAT BILKED 5 OF $37,500 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A convicted con man who posed as a wealthy stockbroker has been charged with 
felony grand theft for allegedly swindling five Antelope Valley residents out 
of $37,500 by selling them bogus IBM stock certificates, the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Giovanni Guccione, 29, of Redondo Beach also is believed to have used 
similar scams to defraud at least 14 other people elsewhere in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties and in at least two other states, although charges have not 
been filed in those cases, the district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Guccione remained in county custody Friday in lieu of $150,000 bail after his 
scheduled arraignment in Antelope Municipal Court was continued to Jan. 11. He 
was charged Dec. 4 with eight counts of grand theft stemming from the five 
Antelope Valley cases. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Detective Dennis Papp said Guccione posed as a broker for Shearson 
Lehman Hutton Inc., driving about in limousines and a new sports car, handing 
out tickets to sports events and promising his victims returns on their 
investments of sixfold or better within several months. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess he was quite a talker. Apparently, he has a pretty good delivery," 
Papp said. "He promised them short-term, high-yield returns on their 
investments. It sounded like too good of a deal to pass up." 
</P>
<P>
Because the counterfeit stock certificates looked real -- complete with the 
company's name, the purchasers' names and other details -- authorities had to 
contact IBM to confirm that they were in fact worthless, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Cynthia Leigh Ulfig said. In the Antelope Valley between May and July, one man 
lost $15,000, one woman lost $7,500, and two men and a woman lost $5,000 
apiece, according to Ulfig. Guccione, if convicted, could be sentenced to up to 
nine years in state prison and be ordered to repay his victims, Papp added. 
</P>
<P>
Ulfig said the investigation produced evidence that Guccione had used similar 
stock ploys on at least nine other victims in California, Nevada and Virginia. 
The loss to victims in those cases was $6,750, Ulfig said. At least five other 
Southern California victims refused to participate in the investigation, Papp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Guccione was arrested at his Redondo Beach residence in mid-September after one 
of his alleged victims became suspicious and filed a complaint. Guccione was on 
parole at the time for a prior fraud conviction, Ulfig said. State prison 
officials said Guccione also had been convicted of grand theft and forgery.

CALABASAS CITY BID LURES 13 CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
If Calabasas voters approve incorporation as a city in a special election March 
5, they will have their pick of 13 candidates for five seats on the new city 
council. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates, who had until Thursday night to file election papers, will be 
on the same ballot with the cityhood proposal, the final step in a long effort 
by activists in the community of 27,000 to take control of their own affairs 
from the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Most candidates polled Friday espoused the need for "sensible development" in 
an area that has seen rapid growth over the past decade. The most pressing task 
confronting a new city, most candidates agreed, will be initiating city 
services and formulating a plan for environmentally sensitive development that 
preserves open space. 
</P>
<P>
An obstacle to cityhood was eliminated last week when developer Cal Johnson 
abandoned his legal challenge to the incorporation. Johnson, who owns Freeway 
Properties, filed suit against the Local Agency Formation Commission, 
contending that the agency should have required an environmental impact report 
before approving the proposed incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson feared that several planned road extensions would be canceled by a new 
city government, but dropped the suit when he was assured that the roads would 
be completed. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates include the following: 
</P>
<P>
* Jack Bethel, 33, a commercial loan officer with Union Bank, moved to 
Calabasas from Canoga Park three years ago, and since then has been president 
of two homeowners associations and served on the executive board of the 
cityhood committee for a year. Bethel, who has a degree in business 
administration from USC, said he can help the city establish financial 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
* Writer Lesley Devine, 48, is involved in efforts to preserve Santa Monica Bay 
and the Santa Monica Mountains. She has been a director of the Topanga-Las 
Virgenes Resource Conservation District for a decade and served as its 
president for five years. She has also been active in the cityhood movement for 
more than a decade and served as president of the Greater Mulwood Homeowners 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
* Peter Eason, 35, a special projects coordinator for California Federal Bank, 
moved to Calabasas 1 1/2 years ago from Northridge, where he was president of 
the Variel Homeowners Assn. Eason, who has a master's degree from USC in public 
administration with an emphasis on environmental management, also has been 
involved in the cityhood committee. 
</P>
<P>
* Michael Fichera, a businessman and attorney, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
* Karen Foley, 54, a real estate agent, wants to ensure sufficient parks and 
recreational programs. Foley, who graduated from UCLA with a degree in 
recreation, has worked in the Los Angeles and Culver City parks departments. 
She also worked with Pierce College's Department of Community Services. 
Currently president of a homeowners association, Foley has been active on the 
Cityhood Study Committee since its inception five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
* Ron Gold, a graduate of UCLA and Loyola Law School, served as deputy state 
attorney general from 1972 to 1978. As a private attorney, Gold helped parents 
win the right to send their children to school in neighborhoods where they work 
instead of where they reside. 
</P>
<P>
* Bob Hill, a stockbroker, has been president of the cityhood committee for 
five years, and previously served as president of his homeowners association. 
He could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
* Gary Klein, 43, a Los Angeles city planner, has lived in Calabasas for a 
year. With a degree in urban planning from Cal State Northridge and 15 years of 
planning experience, Klein said he could help the city write a strong general 
plan that would effectively manage growth. He is treasurer of his homeowners 
association. 
</P>
<P>
* Jeffrey S. Kurtz, an attorney, was on vacation and could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
* Doris Laziolette said she has been "active in almost every community project 
that has come along" in her 25 years in Calabasas, including school projects 
and charitable groups. She has been president, secretary and treasurer of her 
homeowners association and was involved in the cityhood movement for seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
* Marvin Lopata, 49, an independent real estate appraiser who teaches real 
estate appraising, worked on the cityhood campaign for five years, served as 
president and vice president of his homeowners association and has been a 
delegate to the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation. An 11-year Calabasas 
resident, Lopata is also a member of a group of Conejo Valley residents 
studying the area's long-term problems. 
</P>
<P>
* Bill Melcher, an attorney, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
* Dennis Washburn, 48, a senior account executive for a marketing and 
advertising firm, has been active in the cityhood drive for more than a decade. 
He has a degree in political science and international relations and served as 
president of the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation for two terms and as 
president of the Greater Mulwood Homeowners Assn. for seven years. He has been 
a director of the Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource Conservation District since 
1986.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S A LONELY LOT, BUT FACE LIFT MAY HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A sea of asphalt surrounds Margaret Westrom's car each day as it sits alone in 
Ojai's new park-and-ride lot. 
</P>
<P>
But the city plans to double the size of the parking lot to nearly 70 spaces 
and make it more attractive, using an $80,000 grant from Caltrans and $40,000 
in municipal funds. 
</P>
<P>
"Day in and out, I'm the only one there," said Westrom, executive director of 
the Ojai Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown workers, merchants and shoppers avoid the free parking, despite 
complaints that parking spaces are scarce near the city's core, Westrom said. 
They don't park there because tree roots have buckled a walkway from the lot at 
414 E. Ojai Ave. And, except for flagging down the passing trolley, commuters 
have no regular public transportation from the lot, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials hope the lot will become a "park-and-walk" lot. There is no commuter 
service out of Ojai other than a South Coast Area Transit bus that runs several 
times daily from Ventura and back -- but it stops at the post office, several 
blocks from the park-and-ride lot. 
</P>
<P>
Ojai Public Works Director Stan Moore said more people will use the lot when 
improvements are made, but they are eight months behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like it's going to be a tremendous asset once it becomes complete," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Plans include taking down a chain-link fence around the lot and putting up 
signs along Ojai Avenue, directing motorists where to park. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger shelter will allow people to wait for taxi service or regular bus 
and trolley stops. The lot also will be lighted at night, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Bicycle racks will be put in, and a new sidewalk to Montgomery Street will be 
installed, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
The city Public Works Department is ready to do the work, but Caltrans is 
reluctant to approve a mid-block crosswalk across California 150, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We may have to forfeit the crosswalk to get the permit approved," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Westrom said she will continue to park in the lot and encourage 
others to take advantage of its benefits. She walks the two blocks from her car 
to her office. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel secure when it gets dark that I'm walking on Ojai Avenue instead of a 
back street," she said. "And whenever buses come into our community with 
seniors, I always have them park down there because it's safer to unload." 
</P>
<P>
But she admits one of her reasons for using the lot could end if it becomes 
more popular. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids ride skateboards in the other municipal lot, and they use our cars as 
backstops," she said. "In the park-and-ride lot I don't get any nicks in my 
paint from skateboards or other car doors." THIA BELL

MINER HAS MAJOR ROLE AGAIN; USC ROUTS HARVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After losing 78 of 116 games during his first four seasons at USC, you would 
think Trojan basketball Coach George Raveling would be overjoyed at the 
prospect of a 27-point victory. 
</P>
<P>
Not really. 
</P>
<P>
Raveling was angry after watching the Trojans rout Harvard, 103-76, Friday 
night before 1,351 at the Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight we lost the contest because we didn't play to the level of our 
ability," Raveling said. "The scoreboard said we won, but our play didn't say 
the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"The question we had coming into the game was 'Could we play at a level that we 
played against Colorado State and Notre Dame?' The answer was a resounding 
'No.' 
</P>
<P>
"We never really were a cohesive unit tonight. We won because we had the better 
players." 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans won because they had Harold Miner, Robert Pack and Duane Cooper in 
the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
Miner scored 31 points in 27 minutes as USC (7-1) extended its winning streak 
to six. 
</P>
<P>
Miner, who hit 11 of 19 shots, scored more than 30 points for the third time in 
eight games this season. The Trojans topped 100 points for the third time this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Miner pumped life into an otherwise dull game with a flying, double-pump, 
reverse dunk with 5 1/2 minutes left. He had missed a routine one-handed dunk a 
minute earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"I took off too far from the basket," Miner said. "I didn't realize where I was 
on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans, unbeaten since going to a three-guard offense, continued to 
flourish as Pack scored 11 points and matched his career high with 10 assists. 
Cooper had a season-high 12 points and four assists. 
</P>
<P>
"I love their guards," Harvard Coach Peter Roby said. "And I'm not talking 
about Harold Miner because everybody talks about him and everybody knows how 
good he is. 
</P>
<P>
"But if he doesn't have those two other guys out there running the show, then 
he's going to be a guy who scores a lot of points on a team that doesn't win 
games. Pack and Cooper are terrific because those guys have no ego. All they 
want to do is win." 
</P>
<P>
Forward Ronnie Coleman added 18 points for the Trojans and Rodney Chatman had 
10 points in a reserve role. 
</P>
<P>
Center Ron Mitchell led Harvard with 18 points, forward Tyler Rullman had 15 
points and forward Ralph James added 13 points as the Crimson (2-8) lost its 
third consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
Leading by 21 points, USC seemed to lose interest. Harvard outscored the 
Trojans, 11-6, at the start of the second half to move within 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
But Miner took control of the game, scoring eight points in a row. After making 
two free throws, Miner hit two three-point shots from the right side.

Cheers to Jim Murray for his article addressing the issue of sports journalists 
vs. athletes. Mr. Murray's story could not have had a better exclamation point 
than to turn over the page and read the list of 24 baseball players in the 
$3-million-a-year club. 
</P>
<P>
I try not to patronize the endorsed products of the celebrity "jerks." 
</P>
<P>
My wish is that more sports journalists would have the courage to let us fans 
know just who the really appreciative "good guys" are and give us a little more 
insight into the long list of the ungrateful. If so, then perhaps more of us 
could vote at the cash register, and this whole thing might get back into 
perspective.

When you go down the list of great names in baseball's Hall of Fame, it's easy 
to identify the likes of Ted Williams with the Boston Red Sox, DiMaggio and 
Mantle as Yankees, Koufax and Drysdale and Jackie Robinson as Dodgers, Musial 
with the Cardinals, Feller with Cleveland and Bench with Cincinnati, to name 
only a few. But with the multimillion-dollar game of musical free agency, it 
will be tough not to associate future Hall of Famers with the Bank of America.

AFTER LOSS, HARRICK GETS SOME ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Harrick's inability to recognize, create and adjust quickly during game 
situations has cost UCLA more than just last week's Iowa game. For his teams to 
win crucial games with any consistency, Harrick must not only provide more 
flexible and effective game plans, but, more importantly, must demonstrate the 
sensitivity necessary to call for crucial adjustments at appropriate points 
during the course of the game.

This has been Harrick's major flaw throughout his tenure at UCLA, and it's high 
time he addressed it.

ARTICLE ON THOMAS DIDN'T TELL IT ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read the article on CIF Southern Section Commissioner Stan Thomas (Dec. 10) 
with great interest. As Mark Landsbaum points out, Thomas has done remarkable 
work at resolving some of the knotty problems of Southern California athletics. 
</P>
<P>
What Landsbaum doesn't say, however, is even more important -- how the 
commissioner fulfills his important duties. By that, I mean how much Stan 
Thomas has done to promote and make possible the educational value of athletics 
for all youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas is a rare commissioner of high school athletics, one who pays just as 
close attention to the value of athletic competition for all students as he 
does to the superior programs and highly sought-after athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers and high school administrators throughout Southern California should 
be grateful that he brings these unique qualities to the commissioner's office.

NORTH CAROLINA STATE HOLDS OFF FAVRE TO SCORE 31-27 VICTORY

Terry Jordan ran for one score and passed for another, and Greg Manior ran 41 
yards for a late touchdown, but it took a defensive stand to assure North 
Carolina State's 31-27 victory over Brett Favre and Southern Mississippi in the 
All American Bowl Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored on a 10-yard run and passed 12 yards to Bobby Jurgens as the 
Wolfpack (7-5) spoiled the coaching debut of Jeff Bower, who took over at 
Southern Mississippi (8-4) when Curley Hallman left after the regular season to 
accept the Louisiana State job. 
</P>
<P>
N.C. State was leading, 24-21, when linebacker David Merritt intercepted a pass 
with about six minutes left. Manior scored on the next play to make it 31-21. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Favre, who passed for 341 yards, drove the Golden Eagles 86 yards for a 
final touchdown, with a five-yard run by Michael Welch cutting the N.C. State 
lead to four points. This proved to be crucial when, with time running down, 
Favre drove the Golden Eagles to the N.C. State 20. With Southern Mississippi 
forced to try for a touchdown instead of a field goal, Favre was sacked by N.C. 
State's Mark Thomas as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
Favre, who passed for 7,695 yards during his career, completed 28 of 39 
attempts, throwing for two touchdowns with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who took over the starting quarterback job in the Wolfpack's sixth game 
and finished with 1,221 yards, completed 15 of 25 passes for 166 yards and a 
touchdown.

SANTA ANITA;

<P>
TINY MITE APOLLO RECORDS ANOTHER EASY VICTORY IN NEAR-RECORD TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The smallest horse in trainer Gary Jones' barn continues to belie his size on 
the race track. Apollo, winner of his first two starts, won again Friday, 
running six furlongs in a near-record 1:08 3/5 to take the $79,800 San Miguel 
Stakes by 4 1/2 lengths at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Without any reminders from jockey Chris McCarron's whip, Apollo missed the 
stakes record, set by MacArthur Park in 1972, by a fifth of a second. 
</P>
<P>
Standing at a little more than 15 hands (five feet), Apollo doesn't have a very 
large stride. If he were a baseball pitcher, scouts would call the 2-year-old 
Falstaff-Tumble Along colt sneaky fast. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran much faster than he felt," McCarron said. "He deceived me. He was so 
much within himself that it was pathetic. All I did was shake the stick at 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Jones doesn't think Apollo will get much bigger. "I don't care how big he is," 
the trainer said, "as long as he gives me enough (winners' circle) pictures." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker, who saddled Intimate Kid in the San Miguel, saw Jones in the 
barn area Friday morning. "Your horse won't be ahead of mine down the 
backstretch," Shoemaker said. 
</P>
<P>
Intimate Kid tried to run with Apollo through early fractions of 21 2/5 and 44 
1/5, but couldn't head him. "The other horse kept going, and mine stopped," 
said Eddie Delahoussaye, who rode Intimate Kid. 
</P>
<P>
Roman Envoy, a minor stakes winner at Arlington International in Arlington 
Heights, Ill., finished second, 3 1/2 lengths ahead of Formal Dinner, who 
failed to win for the fifth time since taking the Sanford at Saratoga on Aug. 
15. Intimate Kid wound up fourth, and Sondeed was last in the five-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
Apollo, earning $46,050 for Harold and Diane Keith and Leon Rasmussen, his 
breeders and owners, paid $2.60. After Apollo shook off Intimate Kid at the top 
of the stretch, the only race left was for second place. 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen, a bloodlines expert who worked 50 years for the Daily Racing Form, 
gives Apollo a chance to stretch out and eventually run the 1 1/4 miles of the 
Kentucky Derby, but Jones remains skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"On paper, they're telling me this horse can get the Derby distance, but I've 
got to see it to believe it," said Jones, who plans to run Apollo in the 
seven-furlong California Breeders' Champion Stakes on Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Desormeaux, who rode Apollo to his first two victories, is sitting out a 
weeklong suspension, and McCarron replaced him Friday. McCarron had been aboard 
Apollo once for a workout at Hollywood Park. Jones said Desormeaux would regain 
the mount. 
</P>
<P>
After taking the Hollywood Park riding title, McCarron won three races on 
opening day at Santa Anita and added three more Friday. Many horsemen thought 
that he had come back too soon in August, two months after suffering broken 
legs and a broken arm in a spill at Hollywood. McCarron still has a steel rod, 
the diameter of about a penny, in his left leg, but he says there's no 
lingering soreness or pain. 
</P>
<P>
When McCarron was injured, he was running second to Gary Stevens in the 
national money standings. Despite all the riding he missed, McCarron is still 
likely to finish eighth in purses this year. 
</P>
<P>
Apollo, who has the same name as the 1882 Kentucky Derby winner, is a mount 
that McCarron will be sorry to lose. "He's as quick a horse as any that I've 
ridden," he said after the San Miguel. "I asked him through the lane, because 
he was gawking. The good thing about the race is that I never told him to run, 
I just asked him. He was doing it easily." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Keiths and Rasmussen campaigned another precocious horse. His name 
was Secret, a son of Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very talented," Rasmussen said. "But some place along the line, he lost 
his courage. He ran in the race after Bates Motel won the Santa Anita Handicap 
that year. I don't know what happened, but he was never any good after that." 
</P>
<P>
Laffit Pincay, who turns 44 today, rode two winners earlier Friday and was 
aboard Roman Envoy in the San Miguel. "I had a lot of horse coming down the 
stretch, and Apollo just pulled away from me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides his speed, Jones likes Apollo's temperament. "He's got the right mind," 
Jones said. "The second time we worked him, before he ever raced, I knew he was 
going to be a runner. He had a shin problem that slowed him down before he got 
to the races. He's got the disposition of an old lead pony." 
</P>
<P>
That's the kind of attitude a horse needs in early May, when more than 100,000 
fans are jammed into Churchill Downs for the Kentucky Derby. Maybe it's about 
time that Louisville had another Apollo win its famous race. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Velasquez, whose father-in-law died Thursday, has gone to Santo Domingo 
in the Dominican Republic for the funeral and is not expected to ride again at 
Santa Anita until Tuesday. . . . Nine 3-year-old fillies, including the Wayne 
Lukas-trained entry of A Wild Ride and Chandelier, are entered for Sunday's 
$100,000 La Brea Stakes. The others are She's a V.P., Mama Simba, Aishah, 
Mahaska, Nasers Pride, Brought to Mind and Fly Gaelic. 
</P>
<P>
Apollo accounted for a minus show pool of $8,720, which meant that the track 
had to make up that amount to the bettors. . . . Santa Anita will run the San 
Gabriel Handicap Monday and the Pasadena Breeders' Cup Tuesday. The track is 
dark Wednesday before racing resumes Thursday.

STOCK PRICES IN TOKYO CLOSE OUT '90 ON DOWNSIDE

Tokyo stock prices ended 1990 with a whimper, closing lower on bearish 
expectations of another bad year. 
</P>
<P>
"The realization that this year was a bad one all came out in the end," said 
Masahiko Tsuyuzaki, trader at Tachibana Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
Initial buying during Friday's half-day session sent the Nikkei index briefly 
over key support at 24,000 points. But selling emerged on expectations that 
1991 is unlikely to see much recovery from 1990's declines, brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
The key 225-share Nikkei index lost 91.99 points, or 0.38%, to 23,848.71. The 
market closed for the day after the morning session. It will reopen for another 
half-day session Jan. 4 before normal trading resumes Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Turnover was a light 180 million shares, against 150 million in the morning and 
330 million all day Thursday. Declining issues led advancers by two to one. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the Nikkei fell 15,067.16 points, or 38.7%. Friday's close contrasts 
sharply with 1989, when the Nikkei closed the year at a record 38,915.87, up 
29% on the year. The last time the index closed lower the last day of the year 
was in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the Nikkei's biggest yearly percentage drop since World War II, said 
Kunio Urakami, senior adviser at Nikko Securities Investment Trust &amp; 
Management Co. 
</P>
<P>
"There aren't any bright factors in 1991 either," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, stocks slipped in a very quiet day characterized by a marked 
absence of enthusiasm in the trough between two holidays, brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people are still on holiday and trading is not likely to pick up until 
after the New Year," said a local broker.

Sure, maybe 1990 wasn't all it promised to be. 
</P>
<P>
A press release from Loyola Marymount University announcing that Bart Simpson 
would be the summer graduation speaker turned out to be a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
Ditto the invitation we received to attend the inaugural voyage of Los Angeles 
River Cruises between downtown and Griffith Park. Or did we just arrive at the 
Main Street docks too late? 
</P>
<P>
But if it's any comfort, 1990 was a disappointment for some famous names, too. 
</P>
<P>
Ollie North's ex-secretary, Fawn Hall, who wants to become a talk-show host, 
sat in on two sessions of a Broadcast Journalism 402 class at USC. She was 
asked to leave because she had no registration papers. (She hadn't accidentally 
shredded them -- she just never enrolled). 
</P>
<P>
During the brief stay of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan chief Charles Keating in 
L.A. County Jail, his clothes were lost, as well as $5 of the $25 in his 
wallet. 
</P>
<P>
Junk-bond king Michael Milken was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison, 
meaning he'll have to doff his toupee. Hairpieces are banned behind bars so 
that prisoners can't conceal anything, besides their bare skin, underneath 
them. 
</P>
<P>
And one Princess Thekla von Stett-Vasary wrote to the Hollywood Chamber of 
Commerce in an unsuccessful bid to buy the Hollywood sign "for my Caribbean 
island, from where the 50-foot-high letters, properly illuminated, could be 
seen from far, becoming a landmark for all visiting tourists. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The good news was that Southern California was relatively free of catastrophes, 
though a 5.5-magnitude quake struck Upland on Feb. 28. The ground shook, by the 
way, just as the L.A. City Council was passing an ethics bill. 
</P>
<P>
Universal Studios suffered damage in an arson fire on Election Night, causing 
CBS' Dan Rather to quip that political careers were "going up in smoke, and so 
is Universal Studios." Televangelist Pat Robertson, noting that Universal had 
produced "The Last Temptation of Christ," said that the fire might have been 
the "judgment of God." 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, 1990 was the Year of the Medfly. The battle against the 
fruit-tree varmint was so intense that Jeff Williamson of Sherman Oaks proposed 
a revised city seal (see photo). 
</P>
<P>
The debate over the safety of spraying from helicopters brought out the poet in 
many Southern Californians, including Paul Chavez of Eagle Rock, who submitted 
this lament: 
</P>
<P>
O malathion, 
</P>
<P>
 Thou rule the night. 
</P>
<P>
 For when you fall, 
</P>
<P>
 We hide from sight. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, it was the Year of the Traffic Jam. Memorable freeway obstacles 
included bees tormenting drivers on the Artesia, a load of L.A. Dodger programs 
spilled across several lanes of the Hollywood, a pack of dogs that forced a 
shutdown of the Glendale in Echo Park, and dozens of diapers stalling traffic 
on the San Diego. Fortunately, the diapers were the disposable variety. 
</P>
<P>
The book, "Manifold Destiny -- The One, The Only, Guide to Cooking on Your Car 
Engine," offered tips on how to make use of freeway time with such 
internal-combustion dishes as "Melrose Ave. Chicken." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the congestion was enough to make you want to do what the businessman in 
Terry Allen's sculpture outside the downtown Citicorp complex (see photo) is 
doing. 
</P>
<P>
Or make you want to contact your local representative: 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joy Picus, stalled in traffic on the Hollywood Freeway, was asked 
by a motorist in the next lane: 
</P>
<P>
"Would you mind calling my office and telling them I'm going to be late for the 
deposition? My name is Sharon . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Parking was a problem, too -- for almost everyone. Several limousines parked 
outside the Bonaventure Hotel during a visit by President Bush were 
spray-painted with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Ever the innovator, L.A. County saw the 1990 birth of a combination hair 
salon/dating service in Woodland Hills, a surfboard art show in Santa Monica, 
and a proposal by a group of engineers in Montrose to build orbiting space 
arenas for zero-gravity sporting events (the Raiders turned them down). 
</P>
<P>
Comic John Pate unveiled his collection of "Star Tracks," autographed 
tread-marks of celebrity-driven vehicles on canvas. 
</P>
<P>
And a downtown restaurant announced plans for L.A.'s first earthquake-themed 
restaurant, Epicenter, complete with photos and paintings of famous shakers. 
Prices, it promised, would be of moderate magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
Most innovative court defense came from a deputy district attorney, ticketed in 
Beverly Hills for walking his dog without a leash. He unsuccessfully argued 
that he was able to control the hound with a "psychological leash." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of deputy district attorneys' (and man's) best friend, the city of 
Manhattan Beach won honors for Most Graphic Sign (see photo), giving dog-owners 
the scoop on their responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
And, finally, our Jane Fonda-as-a-Texas-election-issue item: 
</P>
<P>
Jim Hightower, a Democratic candidate for state office, was accused of once 
having "visited Jane Fonda's home." Hightower said he never had. A spokeswoman 
for his Republican opponent then responded that Hightower had visited Los 
Angeles. And the spokeswoman added: "Los Angeles is the home of Jane Fonda."

May it ever be so.

AROUND THE VALLEY: REGULARS FIND THE CORNER BAR AN OASIS IN INDUSTRIAL DESERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BY SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Sebastian Rotella is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the heart of an industrial labyrinth in Van Nuys, there is a neighborhood 
bar without a neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The narrow street curves through a gray landscape of warehouses, factories, 
automotive businesses, marble-cutting shops and railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Neon beer signs and Christmas lights pulse in the barred windows of the bar on 
the corner. A sign advertises drink, food, pool, satellite television -- an 
island of consumption in a sea of production. 
</P>
<P>
The bar overlooks a junkyard: vast heaps of lumber, car skeletons, beach 
umbrellas, the congealed frenzy of debris penned in by a chain-link fence. Two 
black dogs of indistinguishable breed trot toward the junkyard past a man 
pushing a shopping cart loaded with plastic bags. The man hunches beneath a 
baseball cap and an old coat. A boy walks next to him. 
</P>
<P>
They are watched by a Doberman standing on the roof of a warehouse, a lean 
silhouette in the pale light of a winter morning. 
</P>
<P>
A few blocks from the bar, the General Motors plant on Van Nuys Boulevard is 
quiet for the holidays, the parking lot barren and melancholy -- a grace period 
between a grim 1990 and an uncertain 1991. 
</P>
<P>
A few blocks from the bar is one of the deadliest spots in the San Fernando 
Valley, the Blythe Street gauntlet, where an outsider's car is stopped by a 
barricade erected to thwart drug trafficking. As the car turns back, it is 
swarmed suddenly by youths in black poplin jackets, close-cropped hair and wool 
caps. They gesture and shout, one of them brandishing a stick with a mocking 
nonchalance; around here, assault rifles come out when the sun goes down. 
</P>
<P>
But at about 10 a.m. on a cold Friday, the last Friday of the year, the bar is 
an oasis, part of a far-flung archipelago of weekday urban refuges for anybody 
anywhere who has to go to work soon, or forget about work fast. 
</P>
<P>
Or find something to do in the morning instead of work. 
</P>
<P>
"Chivas, right?" The red-haired waitress thumps a shot glass in front of the 
mailman. "That's what you usually have, right?" 
</P>
<P>
The mailman is the only customer at the red, L-shaped counter. He murmurs a 
response, leaning forward, his long, uniformed legs hooked in the stool. The 
mailman's hair is pasted back in gray-white waves. He watches the waitress pour 
a beer chaser then glances at the television in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
The screen shows a cheerleading contest in which trim young men are tossing 
trim young women impossibly high in the air, a soaring, gleaming whirl of 
golden hair, skirts and legs. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesus," the mailman says. 
</P>
<P>
Rows of sports pennants and photographs of athletes in action clutter the walls 
and ceiling. There is a pool table, a jukebox and electronic dart boards. An 
electric sign advertises schnapps shooters for $1.50. Trucks rattle the windows 
periodically, a lumbering, single-file herd. 
</P>
<P>
The Coke tastes vaguely like Windex. 
</P>
<P>
The mailman and the waitress are talking about drinking. 
</P>
<P>
"Who was there the other night?" the mailman says. He looks to be in his 40s. 
</P>
<P>
"Just some people that was drunk," the waitress says, and they laugh. She is 
about 15 years younger, short and pale, in a shaggy sweater. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite a weekend," the mailman says. "I figured I went through three 
bottles of Chivas. A bottle of V.O. And looking at what I had to clean up for 
the garbage man, maybe three cases of beer." 
</P>
<P>
The waitress lights a cigarette. "I was going to quit." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't quit," the mailman says. "I stop. I don't say something stupid like 
quit anymore. You can stop for a minute or you can stop for a week." 
</P>
<P>
The television fills with images of a young Muhammad Ali -- an advertisement 
for a video of his fights -- clowning, jabbing, dancing around a fallen 
opponent, eyes wide and mouth blazing, strong as a lion and pretty as a girl. 
</P>
<P>
The mailman watches. 
</P>
<P>
About 11:15, two long-haired men enter. They wear sweat shirts and jeans. One 
man has a ponytail and carries two red-tailed darts in a leather sheath. They 
greet the waitress, order Budweisers, and are immediately captivated by the 
high-flying cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
"Damn," says the man with the ponytail, who has a slow drawl and a gargling 
laugh. "They're pretty good. Last time I was in here, I had to watch 
wrassling." 
</P>
<P>
Two more regulars take stools at the opposite end of the bar: a pinch-faced, 
elderly man carrying a bundle of papers, who taps a thin cigar rhythmically on 
an ashtray. And a deep-voiced, dark-haired woman in a skirt, who slides in next 
to the elderly man and arms herself with a glass of wine. 
</P>
<P>
They launch into a conversation about football and bets, studying the old man's 
papers on the bar. The woman pulls a sheaf of $20 bills from her purse. 
</P>
<P>
Another customer asks the waitress about lunch, because the signs plastered on 
the door and walls announce "kitchen now open" and "food served all day." 
</P>
<P>
The mailman interrupts, pulling on tinted glasses: "They don't serve food here 
no more. Not since they decided they were going broke." 
</P>
<P>
With that, the mailman buys the waitress and himself a final round. "To your 
health and whatever else." 
</P>
<P>
They down the Chivas shots, the beer chasers. The waitress makes a face. The 
mailman scoops a stack of letters off the bar and heads out, accompanied by 
"Bad Moon Rising," which the dart throwers have selected on the jukebox. His 
mail truck appears and disappears in the barred window. 
</P>
<P>
In the outside world, it is lunchtime. 
</P>
<P>
In the bar on the corner, it is time for another drink.

OVERCROWDING IN L.A. SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times article "District Wrestles With Crowding at High Schools" (Metro, 
Nov. 20) relates a very sad tale for all of our Los Angeles students, parents 
and teachers -- too few classrooms and none under construction. 
</P>
<P>
As president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, I would like the Los Angeles 
community and the new superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, Bill Anton, to join me in saying, "We're mad as hell and we're not 
willing to take it any more!" 
</P>
<P>
We've known for years that the influx of new students was going to cause us 
massive classroom shortages -- but no additional high schools were constructed. 
</P>
<P>
It is being argued that the cost of property in the central area of Los Angeles 
is prohibitively high and that to build high schools takes 17 or more acres of 
land, which is basically non-existent unless you use eminent domain and 
dislodge families from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
UTLA supports the Ambassador Hotel as a high school site. But that's only one 
site, and we need multiple sites. So, let's set the Ambassador aside and get 
down to cases. 
</P>
<P>
The solution to our school housing problems is twofold. 
</P>
<P>
First, a new thinking must take place in reference to building junior and 
senior high schools. Do we really need 17 or 18 acres for a secondary school? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps we ought to be finding half that acreage and building up, rather than 
out. Why not four schools to accommodate 1,000 pupils each instead of one 
school for 4,000 students? 
</P>
<P>
What about sports? Those students who want to participate in sports should be 
allowed to enroll in schools which already have the facilities. After all, the 
greatest percentage of our school population is there to learn academic 
thinking and vocational skills. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that the high school of the future will serve students and parents 
better if it's smaller and more intimate. Students would know their peers, and 
teachers would get to know all of the students better. Planning, counseling and 
safety would certainly be enhanced with smaller school size. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, I feel that it is vital to streamline school construction. I want to 
see new schools within the next two years. We can put up a 60-story structure 
in a two-year period. It seems to take forever to erect a secondary school. 
</P>
<P>
I call upon the district and our friends in the Legislature to expedite a 
building program for Los Angeles that will not let a generation of our students 
suffer for lack of adequate housing. 
</P>
<P>
As president of UTLA, I pledge my support to work with the school district, the 
business community and the Legislature to make things happen for all of our 
children and teachers.

U.N. VOTE AGAINST ISRAEL ON PALESTINIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
High fives to U.N. Security Council for its endorsement of an international 
peace conference to resolve the Palestinian issue. 
</P>
<P>
Israel claims to want a peace treaty with its Arab neighbors, but won't 
participate in an international conference to resolve the crises. 
</P>
<P>
Israel also asserts that it wants to reach a negotiated settlement with duly 
elected representatives of the Palestinians, but refuses to meet with their 
overwhelming choice, the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Such doublespeak is probably a smoke screen to mask the policies of Israel's 
right wing, as exemplified by Israeli Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, who was 
recently quoted by The Times, "There will never be a second Palestinian state. 
Jordan is the Palestinian state." Sharon went on to say that Palestinians could 
have "a life almost without interference." What Sharon and his Likud buddies 
are really offering the Palestinians is continuing subjugation; there is no 
incentive for them to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
The litany of PLO atrocities against innocents is deserving of worldwide 
condemnation and suspicion. However, the same can be said of Israeli 
involvement in atrocities dating back to 1948, such as the King David Hotel, 
Dier Yassin, Lod, etc. 
</P>
<P>
What is so tragic about all of this is that Israel has struggled too long and 
shed too much blood not to understand the aspirations of another people who are 
currently struggling and bleeding for identical reasons. Any Palestinian 
solution must embody the principle that survival and independence be equally 
weighted for both sides, rather than the present concept that the survival of 
one people depends upon the subjugation of another.

DEALING WITH SOCIOPOLITICAL WORLD CHANGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congratulations to The Times on its recent special report on "Seeking a New 
World" (World Report, Dec. 11 and 18), and which to me was the most significant 
series in my more than 30 years' readership of your paper. 
</P>
<P>
While President Bush recently called for a "new world order," since his "read 
my lips" reversal, I find it most difficult to accept his new world order 
pronouncement as anything more than rhetoric, as was also Ronald Reagan's "a 
new beginning" statement of a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
In the epilogue of the special report, Paul Nitze is quoted as stating, "We 
need a strategic concept, and we aren't hearing one." There is no denying that 
one of the greatest needs in today's world is for the development and 
availability of a realistic global strategy to bring forth a new and better 
world order. 
</P>
<P>
The fact of the matter is that such a strategy does exist and is available now. 
I refer to the New Reality Education program as developed by the International 
Center for Advanced Study. Its purpose is to encourage and develop that higher 
level of awareness of modern world realities, and without which there can be no 
significant improvement in the overall human condition. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is that to too great an extent the leadership in both this country 
and abroad, in terms of global awareness realities, has been looking but not 
seeing, listening but not hearing, reading and observing but not comprehending. 
What this has bred is not leadership but mis-leadership; not opportunities won 
but opportunities lost. 
</P>
<P>
In view of all this, has not the time come to face up to the realities involved 
in the building and achieving of a new and better world order? If not for 
ourselves, then at least for the sake of our children and future generations?

<TEXT>
<P>
Your Dec. 18 World Report is a sad and frightening reading. Its emphasis on 
each ethnic, national and religious grouping arguing "my family" first is a 
basic human reaction, but forgotten is the past on how families survived. It 
took a sharing with family and neighbors to feed, clothe and house those who 
belonged to the greater "connecting" body, the tribe. And the tribes never 
lived in peace without making either war or an accommodation. Only the latter 
allowed growth and development. 
</P>
<P>
Gandhi said, "An eye for an eye can blind the world." Only the "torch" of 
liberty and freedom can end the groping in darkness that such blindness 
produces. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, we learned the Hubble telescope in space, in its limited way, was 
still able to peer 2 billion light years away to our beginning. That darkness 
exploded and created light. There is a lesson for us to ponder and accept. 
Light is needed for us to see each other, and accept the differences. 
</P>
<P>
I wondered, when I read what the Hubble telescope pictured, why is that we can 
peer only into the past. Is it possible that light years back in time blinds us 
to what may be existing at this very moment in our lives, in some distant 
future, and makes it impossible to focus on it? 
</P>
<P>
May we be guided by a future based on the mutuality of all that unites every 
difference into yet but one, for we are all basically the same in form and 
frame. 
</P>
<P>
The Hubble telescope also pictures darkness we cannot peer into, but may be the 
place where we disappear forever, never to escape to shine brightly in the 
firmament that surrounds us. 
</P>
<P>
In a world that now knows how to harness nuclear power, surely the question we 
have to answer, and can answer, is what light we will produce today for those 
in the distant future, who may be seeing, in the Hubble telescope they are 
using, today's past, and all that happens with each reading of the moment?

WILLARD HANES; RETIRED ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Willard Hanes, who produced innovative automobile commercials in the early days 
of television, has died at his Van Nuys residence. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
Hanes died Monday from complications of kidney failure, said his wife, Sunny 
Hanes. 
</P>
<P>
Born Jan. 9, 1901, in Buffalo, N.Y., he came to California in the early 1940s 
and began working for the Campbell-Ewald advertising agency in Los Angeles in 
1948. Hanes produced Chevrolet commercials using innovative methods, including 
special effects. For one commercial, a flower was shown opening its petals to 
reveal a new car inside, an unusual device in those days. 
</P>
<P>
Hanes retired in 1966 as head of the agency's television advertising office in 
Los Angeles. He belonged to the Corsa Club for Corvair owners in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Hanes is survived by his wife of 40 years; a son, Jerry Hanes of Lake Almanor, 
Calif.; a daughter, Barbara Fackler of Colorado Springs, Colo.; two 
grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service is scheduled for 2 p.m. Wednesday at Crescenta Valley United 
Methodist Church, 2700 Montrose Ave., in Montrose. Praiswater Funeral Home in 
Van Nuys is handling the arrangements. Donations can be made in Hanes' name to 
Camp Ronald McDonald for Good Times.

JURY PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How can it be possible that the state only pays it citizens $5 per day and 15 
cents per mile one way for transportation when they are asked to report for 
jury duty? This doesn't evencome close to minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
The daily pay barely covers lunch in one of the local restaurants, and the 
allowance of 7 1/2 cents per mile does not even cover the price of gas for a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
Some people who serve are compensated by their employers, but those who are 
unemployed and/ or retired are insulted by a payment of $5 per day for their 
time. 
</P>
<P>
This is an injustice and certainly should be remedied in the near future.

I am disappointed in The Times. After spending an enjoyable hour reading your 
paper, I ran across Page H7 (World Report), and an article on the Third World 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
The article was enlightening as was the adjacent chart defining the world's 11 
poorest nations. 
</P>
<P>
Why is there a picture of a dump in Manila at the center of the article, with 
the caption describing 20,000 people living at the dump? 
</P>
<P>
Your "Smokey Mountain" picture seems to be shorthand for the image of poverty. 
You will note that the adjacent article does not mention the Philippines, nor 
is the Philippines listed as one of the poorest countries, which it is not. In 
addition, people don't "live" in the dump in Manila any more than people live 
in the dump in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There is considerable poverty in Manila, and I suggest you wait to show the 
"Smokey Mountain" photo until you are reporting on the subject.

ARTESIA TOURNAMENT;

CLEVELAND FALLS TO LONG BEACH POLY IN OVERTIME, 75-72

Kenny Collins stared into the eyes of Cleveland High Coach Kevin Crider, who 
dabbed at Collins' bleeding forehead with a white towel. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Vasquez stared at Brandon Martin, who, in turn, stared out at the 
hardwood. 
</P>
<P>
Not a lot of conversation, considering that the Cavaliers had possession of the 
ball with the score tied and 1 minute 42 seconds left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't say anything," said Vasquez, who finished with 17 points. "(Crider) 
just said, 'Run the offense.' We all just wanted to make sure Kenny was alive." 
</P>
<P>
Collins, who took a knee to the head, survived, but Cleveland didn't, dropping 
a 75-72 overtime decision to Long Beach Poly in the semifinals of the Artesia 
tournament Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
After the timeout, Cleveland (10-3) blew its best chance to win when Vasquez 
passed inside to forward Kayheed Murray with 53 seconds left. The ball glanced 
off Murray's hands, and while Cleveland managed to regain possession, Murray 
was able to attempt only an off-balance 22-foot shot at the buzzer that missed. 
Then the Cavaliers fell flat in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Poly (12-2) forward Yikeem Craddock scored six points in overtime 
and finished with a game-high 26 points. Cleveland, which plays the loser of 
Friday's late semifinal between Artesia and Westchester for third place tonight 
at 6:20, never led in overtime and trailed by four with 30 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland led, 39-30, at halftime, but the Jackrabbits came out smoking in the 
second half, outscoring the Cavaliers, 13-4, to pull even at 43-43 with 4:17 
left in the third quarter. Cleveland led, 53-52, entering the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say that they made the adjustments and we didn't," Crider said. 
"The kids still think they know what's best, and they still haven't completely 
accepted the system." 
</P>
<P>
The lead changed hands six times in the fourth quarter, but the Cavaliers 
didn't do themselves any favors: Murray was called for a technical foul for 
hanging on the rim and Vasquez was called for a lane violation that gave Poly 
another free throw after a miss.

LOSS OF USIU MAY FRACTURE ALLIANCE OF INDEPENDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: CSUN AND OTHER DIVISION I COLLEGES HAD COUNTED ON THE SAN DIEGO 
SCHOOL TO EASE SCHEDULING DIFFICULTIES AND FORM A POSTSEASON TOURNAMENT. 
</P>

<P>
The decision Friday by U.S. International University to drop its basketball 
program effective at the end of the season leaves Cal State Northridge without 
a soulmate in a quest to form an alliance of NCAA Division I independents. 
</P>
<P>
USIU Athletic Director Al Palmiotto was the leader of the American Alliance, a 
group of Division I independents that had agreed to play each other twice each 
season, beginning in the 1991-92 season. One game would be played on the road 
and the other at home. 
</P>
<P>
The decision means that CSUN, which was scheduled to play USIU twice this 
season, will not have to scramble to find replacements. 
</P>
<P>
Palmiotto also was behind efforts to initiate a single-elimination postseason 
tournament in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
The alliance-tournament winner would not automatically qualify for the 64-team 
NCAA tournament but would be considered for an at-large berth based on its 
record and strength of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was USIU one of the teams facing the same predicament as CSUN -- 
playing as one of the few Division I independents on the West Coast -- 
Palmiotto was in charge of the alliance's next meeting set for Nashville, 
Tenn., after the NCAA convention Jan. 7-11. 
</P>
<P>
USIU, CSUN, Cal State Sacramento, Southern Utah State, Northeastern Illinois, 
Chicago State, Wright State, and Kansas City-Missouri have all scheduled one 
another for next season and Youngstown State has shown an interest in the 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Without USIU, the alliance will have to engage Youngstown State or another 
school to prevent its numbers from shrinking and to maintain an even number for 
the proposed postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Other difficulties could arise if NCAA member schools vote at the convention to 
return next season's 25-game schedule to 28 games. 
</P>
<P>
From a long-term perspective, CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy does not applaud the loss 
of an alliance member, but he is more concerned about getting into the Big West 
Conference with what he calls the sister California State schools -- Fullerton, 
Long Beach, San Jose and Fresno -- and two schools in the University of 
California system, Santa Barbara and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the alliance makes Northridge's games more meaningful than a 
completely independent schedule.

Lompoc High did everything a team with a two-point lead is supposed to do in 
the last minute of a game, yet the Braves won't be playing for the championship 
of the Ventura tournament tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Lompoc made all eight of its free throws in the last 51 seconds of the fourth 
quarter in Friday night's semifinal against Buena, but the Braves couldn't stop 
Bulldog guard Lance Fay, who hit three consecutive three-point shots in the 
last 21 seconds to send the game into overtime, in which Buena prevailed, 
92-84. The Bulldogs will play Thousand Oaks for the title. 
</P>
<P>
Fay's final missile came at the buzzer and tied the score, 80-80. 
</P>
<P>
His first one narrowed Buena's deficit to 76-74 with 21 seconds left and his 
second cut Lompoc's lead to 78-77 with four seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
After forward Jeff Dubowsky's two free throws gave Lompoc (6-5) an 80-77 lead 
with three seconds left, Buena (6-3) got the ball to Fay, who swished an 
off-balance shot from 21 feet as the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
Fay scored a game-high 31 points, 25 after intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Dubowsky, who scored a team-high 29 points for Lompoc, fouled out with 1:24 
remaining in the extra period. With him out of the game, Buena was able to 
concentrate on shutting down Scott Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, a 6-foot-5 senior center, was held scoreless in overtime after scoring 
28 points in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks 84, Camarillo 78 -- Chris Loll matched the tournament record with 
a career-high 40 points for the Lancers (8-1) in the semifinals. Loll, who also 
had 16 rebounds, scored 16 points in the fourth quarter, hitting six of six 
from the field and four of four from the foul line. The 6-foot-6 forward made 
14 of 23 field-goal attempts in the game. 
</P>
<P>
David Harbour of Camarillo (5-2) scored 32 points but was only nine of 16 from 
the foul line. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura 94, Nordhoff 61 -- Randy Martinez scored a game-high 25 points and Jon 
Seiler added 20 for Ventura (4-4). Leading, 39-38, at halftime, Ventura 
outscored Nordhoff by 15 in the third quarter to take a 64-48 lead. Nordhoff 
(8-4) was led by junior guard Kevin Cochran, who scored 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Channel Islands 80, San Jose Pioneer 30 -- Marlowe Durmiendo scored 16 points 
and Raycean Campbell added 14 for Channel Islands (7-2). The Raiders shot 60.2% 
from the field, hitting 35 of 57 shots, including their first nine in the third 
quarter.

This is the 19th year that Hart High has hosted a holiday basketball 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike the UNLVs and the Indianas, Hart doesn't line up a gym full of 
patsies and walk off with an annual trophy. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians have yet to win their tournament. 
</P>
<P>
They did, however, defeat cross-town rival Saugus, 61-60, Friday night to 
advance to the championship game of the 16-team tournament for the ninth time. 
Their opponent will be East Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus had three chances to win it in the final 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Ali Peek paced the Indians (8-5) with 18 points, while teammate Doug Rich added 
16 points. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Yumbar, who scored nine points in the fourth quarter, finished with a 
game-high 22 points for the Centurions (9-4). 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
East Bakersfield 57, Antelope Valley 48 -- Four starters scored in double 
figures for East Bakersfield (10-2), which will make its second 
championship-game appearance in three years. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Kirkland scored 17 points for the Antelopes (6-8). 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas 70, San Fernando 45 -- Greg Waugh scored 20 points as the Coyotes 
beat the Tigers in a fifth-place semifinal game. 
</P>

Rio Mesa 57, Alemany 49 -- David Halverson had 14 points, Jeff Howatt had 13 
and Manuk Kayauglu added 11 to pace the Spartans in the consolation semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
an Glendale 73, Westlake 58 -- Jason Harper scored 20 points to lead the 
Dynamiters in the fifth-place semifinal game. Hai Tran added 17 points and 
Jerry Armen had 15 points and six assists for Glendale (7-5). 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills 85, St. Francis 76 -- Senior guard Kyle Barrett scored 42 points 
but the Knights lost in a consolation semifinal.

PONCHO SANCHEZ ADDS A DASH OF THE BLUES TO SALSA MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With nine albums to his credit, and as many years leading his own group, Poncho 
Sanchez, who opened Thursday at the Vine Street Bar and Grill in Hollywood, has 
become one of the most dynamically dependable symbols of Latin jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Like most bands of its kind, his eight-piece ensemble is built essentially 
around the percussion section. With the leader on congas, Ramon Banda on 
timbales and Jose (Papo) Rodriguez on bongos, the three-horn front line often 
plays a secondary role. 
</P>
<P>
With David Torrez now serving as pianist and musical director, much of the 
music is composed or arranged by him. The tunes, a mixture of old-time salsa 
numbers and Latinized jazz pieces, sometimes lean toward blues-like elements 
and boppish figures. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez has two remarkable soloists in the trombonist Art Velasco, who 
dominated the Duke Ellington standard "In a Sentimental Mood," and the 
trumpeter/fluegelhornist Sal Cracchiolo, a powerful performer with range and 
chops to spare. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, in some of the more traditional mamboesque works, Sanchez and a 
couple of his sidemen will burst into good-humored vocals that are higher in 
spirit than artistry. But the band comes vividly alive when the leader is 
brewing ingenious cross-rhythms on his congas. During one 6/8 number, he stood 
up and attacked them with sticks, and in the final "Bien Morena," he made 
astonishingly facile use of a cowbell. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Burkert lends an ethnic touch with his flute solos, doubling adequately on 
tenor and alto sax. David Torrez's most significant role at the piano is that 
of supplying hypnotic, repeated figures during the percussion interludes. 
</P>
<P>
Although this may not be a seriously innovative idiom (one of the blues-like 
numbers was a ringer for "Fascinating Rhythm"), it does build enough rhythmic 
tension to maintain a generally engaging level of vitality and excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Poncho Sanchez, Vine Street Bar and Grill, 1610 Vine St., Hollywood, (213) 
463-4375, through Sunday.

WHO ARE THEY?

In "When Gay Means Loss of Revenue" (Calendar, Dec. 22), the brave Steve 
Weinstein describes how the brave ABC network lost $500,000 when the brave 
"thirtysomething" showed an episode including two gay (and undoubtedly brave) 
characters. Weinstein even names gadfly the Rev. Donald Wildmon as the 
(brave/bigoted: choose one) leader of boycotts against advertisers of such 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
What is missing are the names of the cowards: the advertisers who drop episodes 
with gays, the advertisers who fear Wildmon. Why doesn't Weinstein name them? 
What happened to the first W in reporting? Who are these guys -- and how much 
ad space do they buy in the Los Angeles Times?

A 'HAMLET' TRUE TO ITS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Would Michael Wilmington rather be reviewing stand-up comedy again? Do films 
not work unless they're brightly lit laugh riots? In "A Matinee-Idol 'Hamlet' 
From Mel Gibson," his review of the new "Hamlet" (Dec. 19), he takes Mel Gibson 
to task for stepping out of his accustomed persona and daring to be merely 
"more than creditable," and Zeffirelli for not coming up with a "dazzling 
visual concept" and a "brilliant, breakthrough" film. Is there something wrong 
with just being good? 
</P>
<P>
Wilmington's take on the film seems to be that Zeffirelli dropped the ball by 
failing to use his usual "high-spirited flourish and flamboyance" and 
"overdressed sets and rococo clutter." Perhaps he missed this aspect of 
"Hamlet": It doesn't take place in Italy, and it's not a comedy nor a romance. 
It's a cold and dark tale of revenge and introspection. It has ghosts and death 
at every turn, and not a lot of pleasantry. It's a tragedy, on a microcosmic 
yet epic scale. Our Dansker hero is trying to decide whether his life is even 
worth living, fighting himself as much as Laertes -- "to be, or not to be." 
</P>
<P>
In the sword duel Wilmington didn't care for, those huge blades are laboriously 
swung in a shadowy hall because that's where it takes place and those are the 
weapons of the time. Broadswords are hacking and hewing tools, heavy, as 
suitable for cutting down trees as men. If you want "an explosive, sun-drenched 
free-for-all" duel, I suggest you go to the Mediterranean in the summer and 
pick up some nice light rapiers; but it's a little difficult to dance tippy-toe 
in wintry Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
By all means point out errors and problems if they are deserved, but don't 
castigate historical and geographical accuracy -- nor blame the director for 
using a dark palette to paint a tragedy. Pitch your Cliff's Notes, Michael; 
I'll loan you my copy of the play.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY: 1990'S POP SCENE; 
</P>
<P>
SAN DIEGO ROCK SCENE PRODUCED LITTLE ROLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first year of the new decade wasn't a very significant one for the San 
Diego pop music scene. Actually, it was rather boring. 
</P>
<P>
For concert promoters as well as home-grown talent, it was business as usual: 
The usual number of box-office triumphs and disasters, the usual number of 
local bands trying to get signed and going nowhere -- or else getting signed 
and still going nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
There were no new concert series and no new major outdoor music festivals. The 
longstanding perception of San Diego as a suburb of Los Angeles was still alive 
and well, as evidenced by the fact that once again, any number of touring 
superstars -- most notably, Paul McCartney -- bypassed San Diego while playing 
cities half the size. 
</P>
<P>
On the local nightclub front, Top 40 cover bands continued to dominate, and 
club owners were as unwilling as ever to take a chance with original music. And 
we didn't see a single local upstart take the town by storm the way bands like 
the Penetrators, the Beat Farmers, or the Jacks did in years past. 
</P>
<P>
But there were some highs: 
</P>
<P>
* The March debut of San Diego Music Magazine, a monthly freebie devoted to 
covering the local music scene. It could be better, particularly in the 
graphics department, but at least it exists: A publication with reviews of 
concerts and records by local bands, the latest gossip and news, band profiles 
and interviews, and insightful features about the various problems bands face 
-- in landing gigs, in promoting their shows, in attracting major-label 
interest -- and how to deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
* Depeche Mode's sold-out, three-night stand at the San Diego Sports Arena, 
during July. Never before has a rock band done this kind of box-office business 
in San Diego. Promoter Bill Silva not only made a mint, he showed all those 
doubting Thomas booking agents a thing or two about just how big the local rock 
'n' roll market really is. 
</P>
<P>
* Michelob Street Scene '90, last September. This Street Scene, the eighth in 
seven years, was the biggest and most successful ever, musically and 
commercially. 
</P>
<P>
For two nights, an eclectic slate of nearly 50 acts -- ranging from rock and 
R&amp;B to reggae and zydeco -- played on eight stages in a 12-block section of 
the Gaslamp Quarter. That's up from one night, 18 acts, six stages, and eight 
blocks in 1989. Kudos to promoter Rob Hagey for building up this annual event 
into a major music festival modeled after the celebrated New Orleans Jazz and 
Heritage Festival. 
</P>
<P>
* The September reopening, in a new downtown location, of Bodie's, five years 
after the original one, in East San Diego, shut down. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the early 1980s, Harvey Bodie was one of the few local nightclub owners 
who believed in booking bands that play only their own material, and his club 
was a nursery of sorts for such future hometown heroes as the Beat Farmers, 
Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper, and the Jacks. Now, son Brett has effectively taken 
up where dear old dad left off, and once again, Bodie's is the place to hear 
the best original rock 'n' roll this town has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
* Buddy Blue's end-of-summer comeback. In 1986, this talented 
singer-songwriter-guitarist left the Beat Farmers and formed his own band, the 
Jacks. With their repertoire of infectious "blue-eyed soul" originals, the 
Jacks quickly became one of the top-drawing live acts in town. 
</P>
<P>
In early 1988, they were signed by the nationally distributed Rounder Records 
label, which later that year released their brilliant debut album, "Jacks Are 
Wild." Unfortunately, the album was a commercial flop, and after a year and a 
half of searching, in vain, for a new record deal, Blue gave up. In December, 
1989, the Jacks disbanded and Blue took a job as a reporter with the La Jolla 
Light newspaper, covering the education beat. 
</P>
<P>
Blue continued writing songs, cutting demos, and pitching them to various 
labels. By summer's end, his efforts finally paid off: He landed a solo deal 
with Rhino Records and promptly resurrected the Jacks to back him in the 
studio. Blue's album, "Guttersnipes 'n' Zealots," is due out next February. In 
the meantime, the Jacks have returned to the local nightclub circuit, busily 
cultivating a whole new legion of fans. 
</P>
<P>
There was also some not-so-good happenings: 
</P>
<P>
* The pricey remodeling last spring of Humphrey's on Shelter Island, the site 
of the popular annual Concerts by the Bay series. 
</P>
<P>
It was a case of noble intentions -- a permanent snack bar, additional 
restrooms, professional landscaping -- but poor execution. The once-breezy, 
open-air venue, overlooking the Shelter Island Yacht Basin, was essentially 
walled off. The tidy bayfront walkway is too Better Homes and Gardens, as is 
the pre-fab pond to the right of the stage. If it ain't broke, don't fix it? 
</P>
<P>
* The loss, also last spring, of the California Theater as a thriving concert 
venue. In 1986, the death of its owner put a temporary end to the downtown 
landmark's decade-long run as one of San Diego's busiest pop-concert spots. Two 
years later, however, Avalon Attractions cut a deal with the building's 
trustees and the California Theater was back in business, subsequently hosting 
such pop heavyweights as Ziggy Marley, Belinda Carlisle, Iggy Pop and Steve 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, the theater was sold. The first thing the new owners did was apply 
for a demolition permit. Then they booted out Avalon and imposed a ban on any 
further pop concerts. 
</P>
<P>
* Milli Vanilli's May appearance at the Sports Arena. No comment necessary. 
</P>
<P>
* The September closure of Rio's in Loma Portal. For nearly four years, Rio's 
had been one of San Diego's most popular "alternative" nightclubs, regularly 
showcasing such talented local original-music bands as the Jacks, Robert Vaughn 
and the Shadows, Comanche Moon, and Secret Society. 
</P>
<P>
The entire time, owner Cameron Moshtaghi had been fighting with the state 
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) over his refusal to serve food, 
one of the requirements of his liquor license. 
</P>
<P>
After a protracted legal battle, the ABC in early June revoked Moshtaghi's 
license. And on Sept. 21, after nearly four months of trying, in vain, to 
survive without alcohol sales, the feisty Moshtaghi threw in the towel and 
closed Rio's for good. 
</P>
<P>
* The escalating price of concert tickets. The average price of a ticket to a 
Sports Arena show went up to $20, from $18.50 in 1989. And choice tickets to a 
pair of concerts at San Diego State University's Open Air Theater, Fleetwood 
Mac in June and Anita Baker in August, sold for a record $51.50 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
Also in 1990, other things that were neither good nor bad but just interesting 
include: 
</P>
<P>
* The Beat Farmers' getting around, finally, to releasing a live album, the 
appropriately titled "Loud and Plowed and . . . LIVE!!" Recorded last New 
Year's Eve at the Bacchanal, the double album, with more than 70 minutes of 
music, is the best thing these guys have ever put out. The Beat Farmers have 
always sounded better live than in the studio, and this album comes awfully 
close to capturing the intensity of their concerts. 
</P>
<P>
* Earl Thomas' putting out a positively dazzling debut album, "I Sing the 
Blues," on his own Conton Records label. The talented young blues singer and 
his band, the Blues Ambassadors, began playing around town and by late summer 
were drawing standing- room-only crowds to their Friday night gigs at Croce's 
Top Hat downtown. 
</P>
<P>
* Merry Go Down's leading the pack of promising new bands to emerge. Led by 
singer-songwriter Marcelo Radulovich, formerly with Playground Slap, their 
music is a beat-happy hybrid of urban funk and sophisticated techno-pop. 
</P>
<P>
Merry Go Down didn't hit the clubs until October, but already, they've built up 
a strong local following. And having seen a couple of their shows and listened 
to their demo tape, I'm convinced these guys have what it takes to make it big 
on a national level. All they need is a record deal and some good promotion. 
</P>
<P>
* Mojo Nixon's splitting from his longtime sidekick, the washboard-strummin' 
Skid Roper, and recording his sixth album, "Otis," with a rock 'n' roll band 
that included John Doe, formerly with pioneering L.A. punk band X, on bass. The 
album came out in late summer, and Nixon subsequently formed a road band, the 
Toadlickers. They've just gotten back from a two-month U.S. tour.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY: 1990'S CLASSICAL SCENE;

<P>
BLACK INK TOPS OFF QUIET YEAR

<P>
With apologies to humorist Garrison Keillor, it has been a quiet musical year 
in San Diego. In this Lake Wobegon by the Pacific, not even the dread angel of 
fiscal crisis passed over the city's major musical organizations this year, 
visiting instead the theater companies. 
</P>
<P>
So it is fitting, then, that 1990's biggest story, after a decade of financial 
woes, is that the San Diego Symphony inaugurated the year by retiring its 
$4.3-million debt on Symphony Hall. The combination of a $2.5-million gift from 
San Diego newspaper publisher Helen Copley and the forgiveness of the remaining 
$1.8-million debt by four local banks put the orchestra solidly in the black 
for the first time in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
Over at the San Diego Opera, ever-prudent general director Ian Campbell 
maintained a healthy surplus in the company bank accounts for the third year in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
It was a year in which both the symphony and the opera began to take 
20th-Century repertory seriously. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Opera's most successful production of its 1990 season was Francis 
Poulenc's "Les Dialogues des Carmelites" in February. The melodious 1956 opera 
hardly qualifies for avant-garde status, but this austere, starkly realistic 
music drama had never been attempted by the local company. Dramatically 
persuasive and unusually well-sung, the production demonstrated to the 
conservative local opera public that there is viable operatic life after 
Menotti's cloying Puccini reprises. 
</P>
<P>
On the heels of the Poulenc production, Campbell announced he would include at 
least one challenging 20th-Century opera in each upcoming season. The offerings 
of the 1991 season feature both Benjamin Britten's 1947 comic opera "Albert 
Herring" and American composer Carlisle Floyd's new version of his 1962 grand 
opera "The Passion of Jonathan Wade." 
</P>
<P>
In a pair of concerts at UC San Diego's Mandeville Auditorium in January and 
February, the San Diego Symphony featured major orchestral works by Pulitzer 
Prize-winning composers Charles Wuorinen and Roger Reynolds. Although these 
recent compositions (none earlier than 1984) were well-received, attendance was 
modest, and symphony management declined to continue this forward-looking 
series. Still, it was refreshing to hear the local orchestra play Reynolds' 
1989 Pulitzer Prize-winning composition "Whispers Out of Time" with authority. 
</P>
<P>
Although Yoav Talmi, who became the orchestra's music director in October, has 
stated that he will integrate contemporary compositions into future symphony 
</P>
<P>
programming, his initial selections have been cautious, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
The Samuel Barber violin concerto he conducted on the second concert of the 
season, for example, is stylistically a far cry from either Reynolds or 
Wuorinen. 
</P>
<P>
Contemporary music has been the rallying cry of the UCSD music department since 
its inception. 
</P>
<P>
Notable offerings this year included a weeklong festival in early April devoted 
to the music of Iannis Xenakis. If the iconoclastic Greek composer's verbal 
explanations of his complex music provided little insight, the cumulative 
effect of hearing a range of his works in succession ratified Xenakis' lofty 
position in the current compositional pantheon. 
</P>
<P>
SONOR, UCSD's resident contemporary new music ensemble, premiered Reynolds' 
"Personae" in March. This eloquent, chamber-sized violin concerto written for 
and played by UCSD violinist Janos Negyesy may be the vehicle by which 
Reynolds' name enters the American musical mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
At the La Jolla Chamber Music Society, meanwhile, despite its smug conservatism 
-- executive director Neale Perl recoils at the mere mention of contemporary 
music -- the well-heeled organization made several notable contributions to the 
local music scene this year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the society's aegis, the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra brought John Adams' 
new work "The Wound Dresser" to the Civic Theatre in February. The haunting 
work set Walt Whitman's searing Civil War poetry in a rich, if subdued, 
orchestral fabric. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, when La Jolla SummerFest's artistic director, Heiichiro Ohyama, 
selected Andre Previn as the annual festival's first composer in residence, it 
raised more than a few eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Previn's pair of chamber compositions sounded pleasant and slightly 
innocuous. But, if Previn is to be the Trojan Horse for more substantial 
resident composers in the future -- as Ohyama has intimated -- it will be 
another step in the right direction for the sponsoring La Jolla Chamber Music 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
Among the memorable performances in 1990, German tenor Hans Peter Blochwitz' La 
Jolla recital in October stands out. Beyond the beauty of his lyric instrument, 
the sophisticated and emotionally complex traversal of Schumann's 
"Dichterliebe" and Schubert's "Die Schoene Muellerin" song cycles defined what 
a Liederabend should be. 
</P>
<P>
In May, pianist Emmanuel Ax and cellist Yo-Yo Ma collaborated in a stirring, 
profound program of Rachmaninoff, Stravinsky and Prokofiev at Civic Theatre. 
Another cellist of the first rank, Janos Starker, brought virtuosity and great 
insight to lesser-known works by Martinu and Cassado at Sherwwood Hall in his 
October solo recital. 
</P>
<P>
In the final concert of SummerFest, the Colorado String Quartet delivered a 
stunning, passionate interpretation of Alberto Ginastera's Second String 
Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
Among the notable conductors to grace local podiums, JoAnn Falletta should be 
at the top of any critical listener's list. Falletta, who is music director of 
the Long Beach Symphony, made her local debut in January with the San Diego 
Chamber Orchestra. The local ensemble has seldom sounded as nimble, responsive, 
and polished. 
</P>
<P>
The following month, German conductor Christof Perick rattled the rafters of 
Copley Symphony Hall with his noble, expansive approach to Bruckner's Fourth 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, American conductor Kenneth Kiesler brought a refreshing 
vision of Handel's "Messiah" to Copley Symphony Hall. His approach peeled back 
pious tradition to get to the oratorio's Baroque roots, and the San Diego 
Symphony and Master Chorale responded with laudable precision and spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Among the disappointments of the year, Paul Dresher's contemporary opera "Power 
Failure" comes immediately to mind. 
</P>
<P>
Dresher's Berkeley-based ensemble brought the minimalist work to the Spreckels 
Theatre in February amid much fanfare, but the opus turned out to be 
dramatically simplistic and musically static in a deadly way. But Dresher's 
low-budget group had no patent on dullness. In April, the San Diego Opera took 
Mozart's inspired "Die Zauberfloete" and imaginative sets by Maurice Sendak and 
somehow managed to squeeze all of the magic out of the opera. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the rising Siberian baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky made his 
long-awaited West Coast recital debut in La Jolla's Sherwood Auditorium. His 
shallow interpretations and callous over singing of the all-Italian program 
made many listeners wonder how the judges awarded him first prize in the 1990 
Singer of the World Competition held in Cardiff, Wales. 
</P>
<P>
But no performance was as maddening as guest conductor Alexander Schneider's 
all-out attack on Bach and Haydn at the San Diego Symphony's first Classically 
Baroque concert in November. Anyone with such antipathy for Baroque music 
should be enjoined from even picking up a score by J. S. Bach. 
</P>
<P>
Two passings during 1990 also deserve mention. Zoltan Rozsnyai, music director 
of the San Diego Symphony from 1967-71, died in September at age 62. In more 
recent seasons, he had been music director of the International Orchestra and 
member of the music faculty at United States International University, at which 
the International Orchestra was based. 
</P>
<P>
And the Los Angeles Philharmonic, after a laudable 69 years of playing concerts 
in San Diego, decided to terminate its series after its April 28 Civic Theatre 
concert. Although the local Philharmonic series had once been a coveted season 
ticket, in recent years the demand had waned significantly.

NRBQ: SO WILD, YET SO TOGETHER;

One would think that in running our best-of-the-year lists only four days 
before Dec. 31 that nothing too wonderful would escape notice. But that clearly 
hadn't counted on NRBQ hitting town. Thursday evening the quartet delivered a 
wild 100-minute show at the Coach House that would earn a place on any year's 
list. 
</P>
<P>
NRBQ might just be the model for the ideal American society: a bunch of folks 
doing exactly what they feel like, exploring the full expression of individual 
freedom, but with the awareness, empathy and goodwill to make it all come 
together as a working whole. 
</P>
<P>
The band's sound is nearly anarchic, with elements of rockabilly, free jazz, 
sugary-'60s pop, R&amp;B, cartoon music, blues and other forms swirling about 
in a Wizard-of-Oz tornado. But no matter how many separate directions the band 
members seemed to be traveling in, the music always met up and swung like mad. 
</P>
<P>
Although the band has been together more than 20 years without ever finding the 
hit or financial security it deserves, keyboardist Terry Adams, guitarist Al 
Anderson, bassist Joey Spampinato and drummer Tom Ardolino don't show any signs 
of wear. Rather, there was an unrepressed glee on stage, with the occasional 
sly Duke Ellington-ish smile playing across a face or two, as if they're still 
amazed the people will pay them to have so much fun. 
</P>
<P>
The band never works from a set list. Instead, the ever-manic Adams follows his 
whim through the hundreds of songs the band knows, and several it doesn't, and 
often just launches into them, with the band magically catching his drift 
within the first few notes. Thursday's mapless journey included a number of 
songs from the band's '70s catalogue, selections from last year's excellent 
"Wild Weekend" (which the band typically didn't bother to promote while playing 
on arena tours opening for Bonnie Raitt and R.E.M.), an ode to Girl Scout 
cookies, and so on. The quartet even managed to humor an audience request to 
play the saccharine Bobby Goldsboro hit "Watching Scotty Grow." 
</P>
<P>
The group's musicianship often appeared to be as offhanded as its song 
selection, with Anderson appropriating a Budweiser bottle to invent a 
slide-guitar passage on "Fraction of Action." While he finger-picked a lush 
chordal solo on "Won't You Come Over to My House," on the wild rocking "Crazy 
Like a Fox" he flailed away at his Telecaster like he was trying to strip off 
its garish paisley finish. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the performance Adams slapped, slugged and karate-chopped his 
keyboards with abandon, but his pummeling always produced the tastiest, if most 
abstract, licks imaginable. If Adams has often been likened to a cross between 
Jerry Lee Lewis and Thelonious Monk, it is only because the image is so apt. He 
perfectly combines Lewis' fiery recklessness with the spare freedom and novel 
chordings of Monk's work. 
</P>
<P>
On the R&amp;B tune "Honey Hush," Adams thundered out the sort of barrelhouse 
piano solo one might expect if the barrels were filled with nitro and 
Everclear, while on another jazzy number his rhythmic blocking and right-hand 
whimsy recalled Erroll Garner. On many of the songs, Adams played the Clavinet, 
an instrument with the most argumentative tone this side of Robert Dornan. On 
"Wacky Tobacky" he also whipped out an ancient, duct-taped instrument called a 
Rocksicord, which sounded somewhat like a cross between the world's most 
defective organ and a vacuum cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
Even the band's roadies are something special: Soundman Klem Klimek joined the 
group for several numbers on tenor sax, including a Pharoah Sanders-like 
version of Junior Walker's "What Does It Take (to Win Your Love)?" 
</P>
<P>
While most of the fireworks came from Adams and Anderson, the rhythm section of 
Spampinato and Ardolino also flew, as they grooved, with the sweet-voiced 
Spampinato also singing a majority of the band's melodies, which held up very 
well amid all the group's rampaging music. 
</P>
<P>
County guitarists Will Brady and Jodi Siegel (joined by a drummer on most 
songs) opened with a set of finely executed, if somewhat generic, blues 
numbers.

'PHANTOM' DIES OF A SPLIT PERSONALITY

The "Phantom of the Opera," now playing at Copley Symphony Hall, is not a 
pretty sight. Nor is it majestic, inspiring or particularly funny. Ken Hill's 
adaptation of Gaston Leroux's Gothic horror novel is just an incongruous spoof, 
a send-up, a cute little play and little more. 
</P>
<P>
The production's attempts at comedy are troublesome considering that the title 
character, played by David Cleveland, is meant to be a treacherous rogue, a 
tortured soul with a disfigured face who seeks love and finds only rejection -- 
hardly a springboard for comedy. 
</P>
<P>
The production is troublesome on another front as well, as some audiences have 
confused Hill's "original" production with Andrew Lloyd-Webber's "Phantom," the 
sell-out Broadway hit now playing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Hill directed as well as adapted the play, and his version is clever at times, 
but hardly deserves to be touring around the country. Many believe that this 
highly profitable production is riding the coattails of Webber's extremely 
successful "Phantom." 
</P>
<P>
Judging from Thursday's stale performance, the popularity of Hill's "Phantom" 
must come from some outside source. 
</P>
<P>
The premise of "The Phantom of the Opera" centers on the Phantom's "haunting" 
presence in a Paris opera house. The play opens as the new opera manager, 
Richard (Robert Ousley), arrives at the opera house and begins to implement his 
authority. As Richard learns about the opera ghost's demands, which include 
20,000 francs a month and a personal box seat, he pledges to exorcise the 
demon's authority. The Phantom responds with a rampage of murders until his 
demands are met. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Phantom is in love with the chorus girl Christine Daae (Sylvia 
Rhyne), he insists that she sing the lead in the opera's latest production. 
Then, when the Phantom discovers Christine has fallen in love with Raoul 
(Robert Jensen), he abducts her and forces her to marry him. 
</P>
<P>
Director Hill hams up the proceedings, generating a handful of chuckles but 
never really gets his audience emotionally involved in the whole of the 
production. The multiple murders provide actors ample opportunity to deliver 
punch lines ("La Carlotta" is dead? Well, at least she'll stop complaining 
about her sore throat . . .), but once the comic tone is set and the audience 
is conditioned to laugh at the death scenes, the play's tone changes. Suddenly, 
Hill expects the audience to fear for the lives of the young lovers Raoul and 
Christine. Suddenly, murder becomes tragic rather than funny. 
</P>
<P>
The production tries to to shift midstream from campy parody to sincere drama. 
The gears grind and the play sinks. 
</P>
<P>
The show's music, culled from operas by the likes of Verdi, Gounod, and Weber 
(not Webber) is pleasant but uninspiring, stiff and reserved rather than 
catchy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this, the quality of the singing remains high throughout. Soprano 
Sylvia Rhyne, in particular, shines during her two solos and during the show's 
penultimate number, a duet with The Phantom, "Ne'er Forsake Me, Here Remain." 
</P>
<P>
The actors brush their performances with uniform broad strokes. Vince Trani's 
portrayal of the temperamental tenor Faust succeeds hilariously, as does 
Carolyn Marcell's depiction of the superstitious, foreboding Madame Giry. Wayne 
Hoffman, too, demonstrates a strong sense of character in depicting six 
different roles. Serena Soffer (Jammes) and Suzanne Grodner (La Carlotta) meet 
with less success in depicting their respective caricatures; both actors work 
hard for laughs without much response. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's Phantom is competent but unexciting. Acting behind a full-faced 
mask, Cleveland communicates the emotional anxiety of the character through 
evocative physical gestures and cleverly choreographed movement. But Cleveland 
struggles -- and ultimately fails -- to bring about the production's sudden, 
unfortunate change of tone. 
</P>
<P>
One cannot really blame Cleveland for his performance, however, since the 
problems are so fundamental to the production. 
</P>
<P>
Hill must take the blame for initiating, adapting and directing this wholly 
uninteresting piece of theater.

As the population at large prepares to celebrate the New Year, Jews here are 
angry about what they see as the school district's insensitivity toward their 
religious new year. 
</P>
<P>
The school district staff in September recommended a calendar for the 1991-92 
school year that puts the first day of school on Monday, Sept. 9, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The date coincides with Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year and one of the 
religion's two holiest days. Jewish leaders are upset that the school 
administration failed to take that into consideration when scheduling the first 
day of classes. 
</P>
<P>
"The community is outraged with the decision that the administration has made," 
said Leslye Winkelman Lyons, director of the Jewish Community Relations Council 
of the United Jewish Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons said Rosh Hashana -- for which the date fluctuates, as it is based on the 
Jewish lunar calendar -- normally falls later in the month and rarely conflicts 
with the first day of school. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish leaders advised schools in August of the potential conflict, Lyons said. 
When Poway tentatively scheduled its opening, Jewish leaders asked the district 
to change the date. On Nov. 29, they were told that the date would not be 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
"We let them know early enough that no mechanisms were in place for this yet, 
and they should have been more sensitive to this," Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons estimates that there are more than 3,000 Jewish households in the Poway 
Unified District, which serves 24,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons said Jewish leaders will protest the proposed calendar when it goes 
before the school board at their next meeting Jan. 14.

<TEXT>
<P>
The long-range implications of the gulf crisis include several key factors 
seldom mentioned in the short-range rhetoric of diplomats and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Saddam Hussein's savage rape of Kuwait, the seemingly chicken-hearted response 
of the Europeans and Japanese, and the emergence of knee-jerk anti-war protests 
in the United States can all be understood better if we analyze the long-term 
power shifts taking place, rather than focusing on the daily drama they 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
First, take the issue of oil. While all eyes focus on the price per barrel 
today, the gulf crisis could subtly change the long-term geo-economic 
competition among the United States, Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1956, the predominant outside powers in the Middle East were Britain and 
France. When Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal, the French 
and British sought to regain control. The United States blocked their effort 
and took over as the dominant external influence in the region. But U.S. 
influence was itself frequently neutralized by that of the Soviet Union. Thus, 
by the 1970s, OPEC had gained enough strength to disrupt world oil supplies and 
send prices skyrocketing. This brought billions into the coffers of the Middle 
East nations and weakened the relative influence of all external powers. 
</P>
<P>
Had Middle Eastern nations not been able to play the superpowers off against 
one another, militarily and diplomatically, the history of the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries might have been very different. The United States 
would have found more pliant regimes in the region, and oil prices would not 
have skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
Since the '70s, the most important change in the region has not been the rise 
of Saddam Hussein or his aggression, but the collapse of the countervailing 
Soviet influence in the region. This created a power vacuum into which Hussein 
adventured. 
</P>
<P>
The gigantic American military force now in the region would not have been 
possible if the Soviets were still a major factor. Today, they need U.S. aid 
more than the benefits they might derive from their Middle East commitments. 
</P>
<P>
The Middle East could, as some worst-case scenarios suggest, explode into holy 
war and pan-Arab nationalist frenzy. But the reverse is more likely. Hussein 
has splintered the cause of Arab unity. Even the Palestinians, his warmest 
supporters outside Iraq, seem to be having second thoughts. A more likely 
scenario is the further spread of Islamic fundamentalism as the spear point of 
resistance to external influences in the region. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, American influence is greater than ever. And this 
could give the United States a long-term edge in its hyper-competition with 
Europe and Japan, both of whom are far more dependent on Middle East oil than 
America. In effect, the United States stands with its foot on the hose line 
that carries energy to its chief competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Thus the major oil issue is not whether petroleum countries or companies get 
rich right now, but who will dominate oil policy long after Hussein is 
forgotten and what that will mean in the hypercompetition among the world's 
three biggest economic powers. 
</P>
<P>
The second factor in this great global game is financial. Ironically, the 
United States has turned to others to help finance the costs of this projection 
of military power. Neither the Europeans nor the Japanese relish the thought of 
Saddam Hussein directly or indirectly controlling world oil prices. With Kuwait 
in his pocket, and his military machine aimed directly at Saudi Arabia and the 
Gulf States, he could literally destroy the economies of Europe and Japan. Far 
better to enhance American influence, which is limited in any case, than to 
allow oil to be monopolized by an irresponsible thug and assassin with 
megalomaniac dreams of becoming the new Saladin. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Europe and Japan must contribute to the American effort diplomatically 
and financially. But that aid can hardly be expected to be enthusiastic. A few 
votes in the United Nations. A few soldiers and sailors (except from Japan and 
Germany, which have legitimate reasons, constitutional or by treaty, for not 
sending boys to the gulf). And a few billion dollars of support for the 
U.N.-endorsed effort. (Japan's trivial $4-billion contribution is about the 
same as what Sony paid for Columbia Pictures.) 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if looked at myopically in terms of oil politics and regional 
competition, it makes sense for the Europeans and Japanese to rely on American 
forces in the gulf, while, at the same time, allowing the United States to 
bleed financially. For whatever competitive edge the United States might gain 
through increased influence in the Middle East could be offset if the military 
effort radically weakened U.S. finances. This would drive the dollar down and 
thus make oil cheaper for the Japanese and Europeans, since oil bills are paid 
in dollars. 
</P>
<P>
From a narrow point of view, the smartest Euro-Japanese policy is precisely the 
policy we have seen over the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
All this brings us, however, to the third -- and most important long-term 
issue. And that is the real reason why Saddam Hussein must be defanged. For the 
gulf crisis is not just about oil, as American doves insist. It is not just 
about money, either. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it is not about Iraq or Hussein as such. It is about all the other 
Saddam Husseins the world will face in the next few turbulent decades. It is 
about the seepage of nuclear know-how, chemical and biological weapons, and the 
computerized missiles needed to deliver them into the hands of irresponsible, 
if not megalomaniac, leaders. 
</P>
<P>
It is about the possibility that break-away Soviet republics could capture 
nuclear weapons and use them in fanatic pursuit of "sovereignty." It is about 
the possibility of civil war in nu1668048225He is a test-case for how the world 
will -- or will not -- deal with proliferation nuclear, chemical and biological 
weapons in the post-Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows exactly how soon Hussein will be able to detonate mushroom clouds 
in neighboring nations, or to send radioactive winds spreading over thousands 
of miles. But there can be little doubt that this man, who has spit in the face 
of international rules by using chemical weapons against his own population, 
who seized hostages and played cat and mouse with them, and who cavalierly 
accepted hundreds of thousands of casualties in his adventure against Iran, 
would be more than willing to use weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
And this is what makes today's anti-war protests in the United States and 
elsewhere both myopic and ironic. Myopic because failure to neutralize 
Hussein's nuclear and chemical plants today sharply raises the likelihood of 
nuclear conflict tomorrow. Ironic because today's peace-loving anti-war 
activists, many of whom spent decades protesting U.S. nuclear politics, are 
shortsightedly increasing the risk of nuclear wars tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
If Hussein is not denuclearized, and we fail to create new, far more rigorous 
and enforceable rules to control proliferation, the post-Cold-War world will 
make the Cold-War era look benign and peaceful by comparison. In the absence of 
anything better, the United Nations might well sanction unilateral military 
strikes, by individual nations, to eliminate nuclear or chemical facilities 
after a warning from the world community. 
</P>
<P>
If peace marchers want a less radioactive world, it is necessary to look beyond 
today's crisis to the ugly realities that Hussein merely symbolizes. 
</P>
<P>
And that third, nuclear, dimension of the gulf crisis is why Europe and Japan, 
as well as the poorest regions of the world, where most of tomorrow's conflicts 
will be fought, should not permit Hussein to keep the weapons with which he has 
threatened to scorch his neighbors. Whatever happens to oil, whatever happens 
to dollars, is less important, in the long run, than what happens to nuclear, 
chemical and biological weapons, and the hard-to-control knowledge on which 
they are based. 
</P>
<P>
That is the chief long-range lesson of the crisis in the gulf.

LAKEWOOD'S INSIDE GAME STOPS HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>

<P>
The Lakewood High School girls' basketball team deployed its potent inside 
offense repeatedly to beat Huntington Beach, 67-59, Friday night in the 
semifinals of the Marina Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Lancers (12-1) scored 24 points on layups or short shots, most of them by 
6-foot-3 Melissa Gower (27 points) and 6-1 Charon Johnson (21 points). 
</P>
<P>
Gower, who had 14 points in the first half, shot 60% from the field (12 of 20). 
</P>
<P>
"They're tough to handle," said Huntington Beach Coach Nick Bartlett about the 
powerful Lakewood tandem. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach (9-4) managed to stay within 34-30 at the half by converting 
10 of 14 free throws while commiting only one team foul and limiting Lakewood 
to a pair of points from the line in the half. 
</P>
<P>
But Lakewood went on a 10-0 run midway through the third quarter and held a 
54-40 edge at the end of the period. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers, the ninth-ranked team in Orange County, pulled to within nine 
points on a layup by center Jen Johnson with 5 minutes 26 seconds left to play, 
but couldn't narrow the margin. Guard Jana Davis led Huntington Beach with 20 
points. Johnson scored 15 and sophomore forward Clare Walker had 13. Johnson 
also grabbed 18 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach didn't help its cause by shooting 32% from the field. The 
Oilers hit five of 16 shots from the field for their only points of the third 
quarter, a period during which Lakewood scored 20 points. FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ

All Buena Park High School's basketball team had to do was survive two frantic 
Loara comeback attempts and 41 points by Tes Whitlock to reach the championship 
game of the Carl's Jr. Century basketball tournament against El Modena tonight 
at Century High School. 
</P>
<P>
The Coyotes weathered the pressure of Loara's full-court defense to escape with 
a 72-70 victory over the Saxons. They'll meet El Modena, which earned a 
surprisingly easy 76-56 victory over Fullerton in Friday night's other 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock didn't have one of his better shooting games, hitting 14 of 35 
attempts, but when he did get hot, it made the Coyotes squirm. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park (8-4) stifled Loara with its zone in the first half and took a 42-30 
lead before the Saxons came storming back with a 13-0 blitz at the start of the 
third quarter and took a 43-42 lead on Whitlock's two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park settled down behind the floor play of Prentice Johnson, who led 
Coyote scorers with 31 points, and built a 62-52 lead with 6 minutes 12 seconds 
remaining in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Loara (6-7) once again came back and closed to within 70-68 on Whitlock's steal 
and spectacular slam dunk and free throw with 56 seconds left. But Johnson hit 
a 10-footer with 28 seconds left and the Coyotes managed to preserve the 
victory. Angel Barrios also aided the Coyotes with 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena's height advantage and shooting of Bob Baytosh (19) and Mike Terry 
(13) led the Vanguards (8-5) to a one-sided victory over Fullerton's Indians in 
the other championship semifinal. Craig Olson led the Indians with 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
In a consolation semifinal: 
</P>
<P>
Westminster 64, Cypress 49 -- Jesse Gomez scored 28 points and Chris Rae added 
10 points to lead the Lions over the Centurions. Courtney Smalley led Cypress 
in scoring with 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
In a fifth-place semifinal game: 
</P>
<P>
Foothill 77, Newport Harbor 63 -- Sean Amos scored 29 points, Matt Vandrey had 
21 and Nick Konopisos 19 to lead Foothill (4-8). Huy Nguyen scored 32 points 
for Newport Harbor.

POWAY SCHOOL YEAR START DATE FUELS RELIGIOUS CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the population at large prepares to celebrate the New Year, members of the 
Jewish community in Poway are up in arms over what they see as the school 
district's insensitivity toward their religious new year. 
</P>
<P>
The school district staff in September recommended a calendar for the 1991-92 
school year that puts the first day of school on Monday, Sept. 9, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The date coincides with Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year and one of the 
religion's two holiest days. Jewish leaders are upset that the school 
administration failed to take that into consideration when scheduling the first 
day of classes. 
</P>
<P>
"The community is outraged with the decision that the administration has made," 
said Leslye Winkelman Lyons, director of the Jewish Community Relations Council 
of the United Jewish Federation. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons said Rosh Hashana -- for which the date fluctuates, as it is based on the 
Jewish lunar calendar -- normally falls later in the month and rarely provides 
a conflict with the first day of school. 
</P>
<P>
Jewish leaders advised schools in Poway and the rest of the county last August 
of the potential conflict, Lyons said. When Poway tentatively set its opening 
date, Jewish leaders sent letters to the district asking it to change the date. 
On Nov. 29, they were told that the date would not be changed. 
</P>
<P>
"We let them know early enough that no mechanisms were in place for this yet, 
and they should have been more sensitive to this," Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons estimates that there are more than 3,000 Jewish households in the Poway 
Unified District, which serves 24,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
Lyons said Jewish leaders will protest the proposed calendar when it goes 
before the school board at their next meeting Jan. 14 and might initiate a 
letter-writing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Purviance, a board member of the Poway Unified School District, said: "I 
am really sorry that they (the district's staff) didn't take (Rosh Hashana) 
into consideration when they first started negotiating about the calendar." 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the calendar is set, and it is very difficult to turn back, 
Purviance said. 
</P>
<P>
The calendar was agreed upon after negotiations among the unions representing 
the teachers, administration and staff, Purviance said, adding, "There is a 
committee with representatives from all of the different unions, and they met 
again after the situation was posed to them, and they still came up with the 
same recommendation that they started with. The unions are the ones that 
decide, and the board ratifies it, of course, but we certainly don't want to go 
against an agreed-upon bargain." 
</P>
<P>
Purviance estimated that fewer than 1,000 students would be affected by the 
calendar. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a small minority of students that are affected by this out of the 
24,000 students in our district," Purviance said. "The principals have been 
told about this situations, and they are willing to work with the families. If 
they are going to, say, elect the room monitor or assign team captains or 
something like that, maybe they can wait another day for that." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Dyer, assistant superintendent at neighboring Escondido Union Elementary 
District, agreed that to get a calendar renegotiated after it has already been 
agreed upon would be "a major maneuver." 
</P>
<P>
"To follow the practice of opening up your contract is something most districts 
would think very seriously about," said Dyer, whose district will begin the 
school year Sept. 3. "You do not want to go back into that contract once you've 
put it to bed." 
</P>
<P>
Although Jewish students have the option of staying out of school to observe 
the religion's holidays, parents say the first day of school is more important 
for the students and teachers to get informed about and adjusted to the school 
year than any other day. 
</P>
<P>
Other districts in the county also plan to open Sept. 3 and say that the Jewish 
holiday was a concern in the development of the calendar, but not a major one. 
</P>
<P>
"One consideration certainly was looking at the impact of starting school on a 
Jewish holiday in terms of students and employees that would be affected," said 
San Diego City Schools Supt. Thomas Payzant. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant added, however, that the major issue in deciding when the first day of 
school would be was whether to begin school the day after Labor Day, a practice 
that was begun this year, or to revert to beginning school on the Monday after 
Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
That plan, however, might again be looked at in 1994, when Rosh Hashana 
coincides with the day after Labor Day.

STATE STUDY DETAILS AIDS NEEDLE MISHAP AT MERCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Improperly trained technicians, sloppy lab techniques and a lack of written 
procedures are to blame for a young woman's injection with a syringe used on an 
AIDS patient at Mercy Hospital last September, state investigators report. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the state report lays out the chilling chronology of how 
the mistake was made and some of the reasons the woman wasn't notified of it 
for 36 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Based on an October inspection, the report this week from the licensing and 
certification division of the State Department of Health Services says the 
error occurred because a nuclear medicine technician recapped a used syringe 
before placing it into its protective lead container. 
</P>
<P>
It is routine hospital procedure not to recap used syringes, so they won't be 
mistaken for sterile ones. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the problem, it says, a second technician failed to read the name 
label on the syringe before taking it from atop a small refrigerator and 
injecting the woman with it to diagnose the reason for her back pain. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after her injection at 11 a.m. Sept. 25, the technicians discovered the 
error when they found a full syringe with the woman's name on it, the report 
says. 
</P>
<P>
That means not only that the woman was injected with someone else's used 
syringe, but also that she probably received the wrong radioactive substance 
for the test she was supposed to have been given. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of notifying the woman's doctor -- as hospital policy specifies -- or 
their supervisor, the technicians took it upon themselves to confirm the error 
that afternoon with a lung X-ray test that a doctor never requested. 
</P>
<P>
They also decided to inject the woman with a radioactive isotope a second time, 
this time so she could have the correct test on her back performed. 
</P>
<P>
The reduced-dose level in this second injection was determined by a technician, 
not by a doctor, and neither it nor the preceding events were recorded in the 
patient's chart, the state report says. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Mercy's nuclear medicine technicians at the time routinely failed to 
document basic data on the tests they did on patients, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's lawyer, Harvey Levine, said she was told that the second injection 
was needed because they had "missed the vein" the first time. But a technician 
later told the state investigator that "patients are not told (of errors) 
because they are not at risk," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the woman went home on the afternoon of Sept. 25 with no 
indication that anything was wrong, Levine says. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the next morning, a full day after the original injection, that 
the technicians notified their supervisor of the error, the state report says. 
No further action was taken until that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
It was then that a review of records showed that the syringe with which the 
woman had been injected had previously been used on a person infected with HIV, 
the AIDS virus. Still, it wasn't until many hours later -- 1:30 a.m. Sept. 27 
-- that the woman was awakened at home and called to the hospital to be told of 
her potential exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the hospital nor the state report explains the reason for that 
additional half-day delay. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to revealing details of the incident, the state report delineates a 
host of deficiencies in procedures and policies in the hospital's nuclear 
medicine department. 
</P>
<P>
All five technicians performing the tests during October had not taken a 
required course in intravenous therapy procedures and protective rules, the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
Even if they had, the hospital had inadequate written policies on these 
radioactive tests to teach the technicians, it adds. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no written policy and procedure for the preparation and 
administration of intravenous radioisotope agents; also there was no written 
procedure for the handling and disposal of used syringes and needles 
(afterward)," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the Mercy nuclear medicine technicians were routinely recapping 
used needles, it says. This increases the chances of a used needle being 
mistaken for a sterile one, as occurred in the AIDS incident. 
</P>
<P>
The state report was delivered to Mercy Hospital on Wednesday. The hospital 
must respond to the state with a written plan for correcting the licensing 
deficiencies, the inspection found. 
</P>
<P>
"The deficiencies . . . were corrected soon after the incident was discovered. 
We are currently in the process of documenting these corrections with the 
state," Mercy's chief operating officer, Mary Yarbrough, said in a brief 
written statement. 
</P>
<P>
The technician who failed to look at the label before giving the woman her 
injection is no longer with Mercy, but officials there will not say if the 
person was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Levine, who said he plans to file a lawsuit on behalf of the woman 
within the next month, said he feels the report belies Mercy's attempts to 
characterize the incident as an isolated accident. 
</P>
<P>
"The hospital wants to refer to this as human error," he said. "It's not human 
error when you don't supervise people working with radioactive materials. 
That's a conscious decision on the part of the hospital to inadequately 
supervise an ordinarily well-regulated diagnostic area of the facility." 
</P>
<P>
Levine said his client has already received vaccine against hepatitis and 
treatment with AZT, an antiviral drug that doctors hope prevents infection in 
such cases. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, she had her first blood test to see if she is infected with the AIDS 
virus. Results won't be available for about 10 days, he said.

BATTLE INTENSIFIES OVER ZOO'S ELEPHANT EXHIBIT; 
</P>
<P>
ANIMAL CARE: HUMANE SOCIETY ATTACKS CREDIBILITY OF PARK'S SPOKESMAN, WHO DENIES 
ENCLOSURE IS INADEQUATE FOLLOWING THE DEATH OF A 51-YEAR-OLD MAMMAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
In the latest tit-for-tat exchange with the San Diego Zoo, investigators at the 
Humane Society of the United States on Friday attacked the credibility of the 
zoo's spokesman and restated their belief that the elephant exhibit is badly in 
need of repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no nice way to put this," David K. Wills, a vice president in the 
Humane Society's Department of Investigations, said in a press release 
rebutting several published statements made by Jeff Jouett, the zoo's 
spokesman. "He's just not telling the truth." 
</P>
<P>
To support that claim, Wills provided documents that appear to show that top 
zoo officials sought in 1984 to widen a narrow cat walk and in 1985 assessed 
how much it would cost to install heaters in the elephant barn. As yet, neither 
improvement has been made, and Jouett has said that heaters are unnecessary 
because the elephants' body heat is furnace-like. 
</P>
<P>
Wills and Jouett have been trading charges in the press since Thursday, when 
The Times reported that the Humane Society was seeking an investigation of the 
exhibit after the death of Maya, a 51-year-old Asian elephant that was 
euthanized after she fell into a moat and injured herself. Wills charged that 
Maya's death proved that the elephant enclosure is "grossly inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
But, on Friday, Jouett said Wills' allegations stemmed solely from "a 
disgruntled employee who now makes a profession out of zoo-bashing" -- a 
reference to Lisa Landres, a former elephant keeper at the San Diego Zoo who is 
now a Humane Society investigator based in Washington. Landres resigned in 1989 
because, she said, the zoo was punishing her for being outspoken about the 
beating of the elephant Dunda. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett, who has acknowledged that the elephant exhibit is "not perfect," said 
that, by necessity, repairs at the 100-acre zoo must be done in order of 
priority. Although the zoo plans to widen the cat walk eventually, he said, it 
is not an urgent need. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's an immediate concern for animal health or safety or human health or 
safety, then it rises to the top of the priority list," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wills, meanwhile, provided a copy of an internal zoo memo, dated Aug. 9, 1984, 
in which zoo officials listed, in order of priority, what they called 
"modifications requirements" in the elephant mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Roocroft, the elephant supervisor for the zoo and Wild Animal Park, said 
the first priority was improved access for heavy-duty vehicles -- an 
improvement that Jouett said has since been completed. The second priority, in 
a list of six, suggested replacing a large pool with a smaller one in order to 
accommodate wider walkways. 
</P>
<P>
"Currently it is not possible for more than one animal to safely negotiate its 
way around the pool," Roocroft's memo said. "In addition, the space is so 
narrow that the possibility always exists that an animal might lose its footing 
and tumble into the moat." 
</P>
<P>
Another memo a month later estimated that it would cost $4,000 to make those 
changes to the pool and cat walk. 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Roocroft's safety concerns would classify the 
walkway-widening project as urgent, Jouett said no. He said that, although no 
one witnessed Maya's fall on Sunday, he believes she did not fall off the cat 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
"An elephant can be bumped into the moat from any point in the exhibit, whether 
on the cat walk or not," he said. In response to the memo, he said: "It doesn't 
say the elephants were at risk if they were walking in single file. It doesn't 
say that one animal is in danger. Yesterday I saw two elephants there -- they 
walked the whole length and lived to tell about it." 
</P>
<P>
But Steve Friedlund, an elephant keeper who was the first to rush to Maya's aid 
after she fell, said that it is "almost an absolute sure bet" that Maya fell 
from the cat walk. When Friedlund found the elephant, her back legs were in the 
moat and her front elbows were resting on the cat walk, indicating that she had 
fallen head-first from the walk and was trying to right herself. 
</P>
<P>
"The walkway is a death trap," said Friedlund, who estimated the cat walk is 2 
1/2 feet wide. "The zoo has known the problem for a long time. They're 
defending their Disneyland image that everything is safe and sound here. It's 
time to get on with the business of solving the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Another inter-office memo provided by Wills estimates the cost of installing 
elephant barn floor heating. In the September, 1985 memo, Hella Winter, a 
project coordinator in the zoo's architecture and design department, estimated 
that it would cost $15,000 to install a 12-foot-wide heated strip in the 
concrete floor that would run the full length of the barn. 
</P>
<P>
The memo was addressed to Friedlund, Carmi G. Penny, the zoo's curator of 
mammals, and another animal care specialist who has since left the zoo. At the 
bottom, Winter has written: "Please call us &amp; let's decide ASAP what to 
do!" 
</P>
<P>
According to Wills, Winter's memo came in response to keeper documentation of 
frigid temperatures -- 40 degrees and lower -- in the elephant barn at night. 
</P>
<P>
"Without heating in the floor, the concrete draws the body heat away from the 
elephants when they lie down," Wills' press release asserts, adding that the 
keepers recorded the cold temperatures when there were seven elephants in the 
barn. "With only four left, Mr. Jouett's idea that they are 'furnaces' loses 
even more credibility." 
</P>
<P>
Jouett responded that he had heard that Landres and Friedlund measured the 
temperatures in a zoo office, not in the barn, "in an attempt to prove their 
point." 
</P>
<P>
Friedlund countered that in fact, Curby Simerson, the zoo's assistant animal 
care manager, was the person who held the thermometer in the barn. It read 34 
degrees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jouett said that was impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not 40 degrees in the barn with the elephants," he said. "Consider the 
source. . . . Two years gone and 3,000 miles away, Lisa (Landres) is still 
trying to push through her pet projects, and she's using (The Times) to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Reached in Washington on Friday, Landres said, "That's just a lie. You wouldn't 
believe how cold it is in there. Whether I worked there or not, why don't they 
focus their energy on making the place better?" 
</P>
<P>
Sally Mackler, a spokeswoman for the animal rights group San Diego Animal 
Advocates, echoed those sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a poor excuse and an easy out to blame a 'disgruntled employee,' " 
Mackler said in a statement. "We should take a closer look at why Lisa Landres 
was dissatisfied with zoo policies and methods regarding the elephants' care." 
</P>
<P>
Wills also contested Jouett's claim that the elephants may take shelter in 
their barn during inclement daytime weather. 
</P>
<P>
"The elephant barn has not been made available to the elephants as a shelter 
from the rain, except in rare, isolated instances when past keeper staff let 
the elephants indoors due to extreme cold or wind," Wills wrote. "With this 
documentation in hand, you may join with us in realizing that it's difficult to 
know what to believe when the San Diego Zoo responds to criticism." 
</P>
<P>
Jouett responded: "In a hard, cold rain, the doors are opened. If it's a warm 
day or a light shower, and they're showing no ill effects, the doors probably 
won't be open. For an elephant, that's not inclement weather." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "What happens if it rains in Africa or Asia? Do the elephants run in 
the barn then? The elephants like the rain."

STAMPER OUT OF RUNNING FOR DALLAS POLICE CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assistant San Diego Police Chief Norm Stamper said Friday he has taken himself 
out of the running for chief of the Dallas Police Department because the San 
Diego department "is where I want to stay." 
</P>
<P>
Stamper and Deputy Chief Manny Guaderrama were two of 13 semi-finalists for the 
job, according to a list released Dec. 21 by the city of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Guaderrama could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Stamper said he met Dec. 19 at Lindbergh Field with a search firm representing 
the city and was briefed on the situation in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the guy at the time my interest was slim," he said. "We met for a 
couple of hours at the airport, and I heard about what's going on in Dallas. I 
decided this is where I want to stay." 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas police chief's job came open in September, when the city manager 
fired Chief Mack Vines after a grand jury indicted him on a misdemeanor perjury 
charge. Vines is accused of lying to a special panel that reviewed the 1989 
firing of a Dallas police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Stamper said he has been sought after for several jobs for which he has not 
applied, most recently the chief for Eugene, Ore. He said Guaderrama also had 
not applied. 
</P>
<P>
"I called (Friday) morning to let them know officially that I'm not 
interested," he said. "There are a lot of challenges right here." 
</P>
<P>
Stamper, 46, is second in command to Police Chief Bob Burgreen and runs the 
daily operations of the 1,850-member department. Guaderrama, 51, is a deputy 
chief in charge of field operations, which includes all traffic and patrol 
officers and the department's SWAT team.

STUDENTS HONOR TEACHER WITH ALMOST A CENTURY OF MEMORIES;

<P>
REUNION: MARY VAN DAM, 99, TAUGHT IN POWAY OVER A FIVE-DECADE SPAN AND AUTHORED 
A BOOK, WHICH IS THE STORY OF HER LIFE AND POWAY'S HISTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arie DeJong arrived in Poway -- and in Mrs. van Dam's fourth- fifth- 
sixth-grade classroom -- in 1949, speaking not one word of English. 
</P>
<P>
For Mary van Dam, it was a challenge. She spoke no Dutch, and her husband spoke 
only a few words of it. There were only about 400 or so inhabitants in the 
Poway hills and valleys back then, and not one of them was "foreign" until 
DeJong, his parents and his nine brothers and sisters arrived from Holland. 
</P>
<P>
"People looked at us like we came from the moon," DeJong recalled recently. 
"But not Mrs. van Dam. 
</P>
<P>
"She took me and tutored me, after school and during class. All the time," 
DeJong said. "Pretty soon I was speaking pretty good English." 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. van Dam was a very good teacher," said DeJong, who now heads a family 
that owns the Hollandia Dairy in San Marcos. "She changed my life." 
</P>
<P>
His schoolboy crush has lasted more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Mary van Dam shrugged off the memories of those 1940s 
language lessons. They were just a few days in her 99 years of living. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a very commonplace life," she said. "There is nothing much to tell." 
</P>
<P>
But Gordon Stuart, who wrote the preface to Mary van Dam's book -- "As I 
Remember Poway" -- in 1983, thought differently. He wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"As a rule, the people who make history do not write about it, and the people 
who write about it do not make history. Mary is one of those rare individuals 
who has done both!" 
</P>
<P>
She wrote about her life in the early days of Poway and about the people that 
she had known while growing up and going to school there. And she wrote about 
the children she had taught in Poway's first elementary school and about her 
friends and neighbors. She wrote about her life and those around her, and she 
produced the first and only history of the place she holds in her heart. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Mary van Dam's mind is clear as a bell as she sits in her tiny room in 
an Escondido retirement home, autographing copies of the second printing of the 
book, which is the story of her life as well as the history of Poway. It takes 
only a little nudge to set it ringing with nearly a century of memories. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Frank and her sister, Elsie, started their schooling in the one-room 
Bernardo School (near what is now Lake Poway) late in the 19th Century, and 
walked the 3 or 4 miles to class in all but the worst of weather. 
</P>
<P>
"There were all grades from first to eighth, and the school day was from 9 a.m. 
to 4 p.m.," she wrote in her autobiographical history book. "When I fell asleep 
at my desk in the afternoon (I wasn't 6 years old yet), Miss Clay (the teacher) 
would cover me with the apron she wore in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
In later grades, she recalled, she went to the larger (but still one-room) 
Poway school across from where the old Community Church stands today. 
</P>
<P>
"Inside there were rows of desks, graduated in size from front to back and 
fastened to the floor. Some of them were double desks for the younger 
children," she wrote. "There was a slightly raised platform in front with a 
teacher's desk and also a pump organ. There were three tall windows on either 
side of the room with blackboards in between. 
</P>
<P>
"Also there was a blackboard on the wall in front and wall maps which could be 
pulled down out of their cases; these were mounted above the blackboards. A 
stand for the large dictionary and a school clock on the wall completed the 
furnishings. A bucket of water and a long-handled dipper stood on a bench at 
the rear of the room." 
</P>
<P>
With her crystal-clear descriptions, Van Dam re-created those early Poway days, 
describing how, when the school well went dry, the upper-grade boys earned 25 
cents a barrel hauling water from a nearby farm and how, at her eighth-grade 
graduation ceremonies, "we drove to the exercises in a two seated spring wagon 
and we were late." 
</P>
<P>
She was to have read the welcoming address and recalled her embarrassment at 
having missed her cue because of the family's late arrival, and finally giving 
her welcoming address midway through the ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course there was applause, but how embarrassed I was at being late. Things 
might have been even worse though, for we found out later that a spot had been 
burned in my ruffled graduation dress, evidently caused by a spark from my 
father's pipe, which he smoked on our drive to the program." 
</P>
<P>
After two years at San Diego State Normal School (now San Diego State 
University), she received her teaching certificate "which was issued by the 
County Board of Education at a cost of 2 dollars," and began teaching in 1912 
in a one-room school near Del Mar where "enrollment was minimal and attendance 
was irregular" before returning to her beloved Poway, where she taught at the 
Merton School for three years, living at the family ranch and saving her money 
to buy a Model T Ford. 
</P>
<P>
That Ford took Mary Frank to Imperial County in 1916 to teach for $90 a month 
and to meet her husband-to-be, Ed van Dam. But, after her marriage and a few 
years of attempting farming in the arid valley, the Van Dams returned to Poway 
to stay and raise their two sons. 
</P>
<P>
Not until World War II, when the war industry lured most of the younger folk to 
high-paying San Diego jobs and her own two sons were grown and away at school, 
did Mary van Dam return to teaching. 
</P>
<P>
"It was 1943, and the school board had advertised for a teacher and had 
received not one application. So they came to me," she said. "I told them that 
I wouldn't do it if I had to go back to school and renew my teaching 
certificate. So they took me just as I was." 
</P>
<P>
For 11 years until her retirement, Mary van Dam taught the middle grades at 
Pomerado School, molding a new generation of Poway youngsters with the same 
teachings that she had been taught a half century before. 
</P>
<P>
She often started the school day with a prayer, which was legal at the time, 
and usually read to her classes from the classics after lunch. But, most of the 
time she spent on the basics, "reading, writing and arithmetic. The Three R's 
are as important today as they were in my day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I am old-fashioned, but in my mind I can't go along with some of the 
modern innovations. Now they teach the children to use computers, beginning 
down in the primary grades. I think it's more important to teach them to read 
first, save the other things for later. But then, as I say, I guess that I am 
old-fashioned." 
</P>
<P>
Those teaching years "were happy years. In fact, I could live my life over 
again and be perfectly happy," she said, tears filling her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish now that I had gone back into the classroom once in a while, since I 
retired. Just to keep up, you know, not be so old-fashioned," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she took up tutoring, prompted by worried parents whose son or 
daughter was having trouble keeping up with classmates. 
</P>
<P>
"I did quite a bit of that. I would tutor any child who would pay attention and 
who wanted to learn," she explained. "I didn't do it for the money. I did it 
for the children." 
</P>
<P>
But, after her husband died in 1975, "and I found myself with too much time on 
my hands," Van Dam turned from teacher to historian and wrote her book about 
the valley that she loved. She described the dairy farms and the sights and 
smells of the old country store. She told about courting in the horse-and-buggy 
days. She described the terror of a runaway team of horses and the fear of a 
smallpox epidemic. She painted graphic pictures of Poway of yesteryear with the 
same meticulous concentration on detail that she stressed in her classroom. 
</P>
<P>
The Poway Historical Society published Mary van Dam's history of the town in 
1983 and, now in its second printing, it still sells well. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the newcomers to town who are buying it. They all want to know what it 
was like around here in the old days," she said of the book's continuing 
popularity. "Poway is so different now. It's a city, and I can hardly find my 
way around." 
</P>
<P>
Until April, Mary van Dam lived alone in her Poway home until a small 
"incident," a minor stroke, convinced her that her sons were right and she 
should move into a place where she could take life a little easier. It was then 
that her former pupils remembered her and decided to honor the teacher that had 
set them properly on the road to adulthood more than 40 years before. 
</P>
<P>
Arie DeJong, that Dutch boy whom she had taught to speak English so many years 
ago, was the organizer, and the students of Mrs. van Dam's fourth- fifth- 
sixth-grade classes at Pomerado School returned to Poway in September to give 
her a 99th birthday party to remember. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going to wait and do it on her 100th birthday, but then we thought, 
'Why wait?' and we can do it again next year, too," DeJong said. 
</P>
<P>
Most remarkable about the event to Mary van Dam was that a boy remembered her, 
his grade school teacher, after all these years. 
</P>
<P>
"I might have expected it from one of the girls, but, my goodness, it's quite 
unusual for boys to remember," she said. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 to 60 former students and current friends came to celebrate her 
birthday with a church choir serenade, a party and presents, and finally a 
barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just grand to see them all again," she said. "It was just wonderful. 
I've had a rich life, a teaching career, marriage, children and now 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, she thinks, she'll write another book. There's half a century of her 
life and Poway's still to be told. Her hand is still firm and steady, and, 
"although I've never learned typewriting," she could still pen a few chapters 
by hand as she did with her first story. Besides, she has a little time on her 
hands before her 100th birthday party.

A uptown resident shot and killed a transient who apparently was attempting to 
break into his apartment through a bathroom window Friday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Kipling Emerson, 35, died at UCSD Medical Center from a single gunshot 
wound to the chest, said Deputy Coroner Charles Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
David Szabo, 26, told police he was awakened at 3:30 a.m. by someone outside 
his apartment on the 2000 block of 4th Avenue, San Diego Police Lt. Gary Learn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Szabo saw a man in the narrow walkway next to his bathroom window and asked his 
girlfriend to call police, Learn said. After arming himself with a handgun, 
Szabo approached the bathroom and found Emerson trying to crawl in through the 
window, which had been closed, Learn said. 
</P>
<P>
Szabo fired once, striking Emerson, who ran a short distance then collapsed in 
the street, Learn said. Emerson was taken to the hospital, where he died less 
than an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
Police found a prying tool outside the window, and homicide detectives are 
investigating the incident, Learn said. Szabo was not arrested.

Two men accused of kidnaping four San Diego State University students and 
robbing them of $58 pleaded not guilty Friday to 12 felony counts. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Long, 19, and Terry Alphonso Turner, 27, who also uses the name Bryan 
Tanner, pleaded not guilty to four counts of kidnaping for robbery, two counts 
of armed robbery, two counts of attempted armed robbery and four counts of 
assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Long, a crewman on the dock landing ship Germantown, and Turner, a Los Angeles 
resident, are being held on $1-million bail. Each could be sentenced to four 
consecutive life-in-prison terms if convicted on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
The pair is charged with abducting four male students outside an El Cajon 
Boulevard pizza restaurant the night of Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
During a preliminary hearing earlier this month, all four victims testified 
that Turner fired a shotgun shell into the air after one of the students was 
able to withdraw only $40 from an ATM machine. The students also testified that 
Long fired a shotgun blast over the legs of two of the victims and through the 
door of a Mercedes-Benz that was allegedly also commandeered by the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Long and Turner were apprehended by police after the students convinced the 
pair that they could get more money at a dormitory near SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
The men's trial is scheduled for Feb. 13.

A judge refused Friday to lower the $1-million bail for an Imperial Beach man 
accused of using a hunting rifle to shoot a 12-year-old Mexican boy at the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Ray Pannel, 23, is charged with murder in the May 18 shooting death of 
Emilio Jiminez Bejines, who had just crossed the international border with his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Luis Aragon said during Friday's bail review hearing that 
his office has a statement from a person who quoted Pannel as saying he had 
robbed some Mexican immigrants earlier in the day for beer money. 
</P>
<P>
In refusing to lower the bail, Municipal Judge Robert C. Coates said that 
Pannel had proven himself to have "very low integrity." The judge said Pannel 
is "someone who has behaved with contempt for human safety, life and dignity." 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled for Jan. 25.

NEW WAY TO REACH SOLDIERS IN THE GULF UNVEILED

Friends and families of troops participating in Operation Desert Shield now 
have a faster, easier way of communicating with loved ones stationed in Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. department stores and the Prodigy interactive 
personal-computer service have developed a system called USA Connect that 
enables people to send greetings electronically to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"With the situation as it is over there, we felt it was our responsibility to 
find a way to help people with a less time-consuming way of sending messages to 
loved ones and also take some of the burden off the U.S. Postal Service," 
marketing representative Jean Joseph said at an open house for the system 
Friday at the Sears store in South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Prodigy, which was formed through a partnership of International Business 
Machines Corp. and Sears, is a national network of more than 700,000 home 
computers and offers 24-hour news services, educational games and entertainment 
listings for a monthly fee. 
</P>
<P>
To use USA Connect, a sender must know the name and address of the Desert 
Shield recipient and have a personal computer equipped with the Prodigy 
service. 
</P>
<P>
After the letter is typed into the computer, it is sent through telephone lines 
to a special electronic mailbox at the Prodigy service. From there, it is 
transmitted electronically through the IBM Information Network to the Middle 
East, where the letter is printed out and delivered to military postal 
operations for distribution. 
</P>
<P>
"Up until now, a letter from the United States would take anywhere from two to 
three weeks to get there," Joseph said. "With USA Connect, it takes no more 
than two days to a week." 
</P>
<P>
Prodigy plans to continue USA Connect until March.

STAIN KIT COULD SAVE YOUR RUG, AND SANITY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fifteen years ago, at a Christmas party, I spilled an entire glass of red wine 
on a deep-pile, snow white, wall-to-wall carpet. 
</P>
<P>
It just happened. I had apparently been holding the glass too lightly and 
before I could react it was on its way toward the luxuriously plush, 
brilliantly white nap. I could only stand there stupidly and watch the blood 
drain from the hostess's face as the radiantly crimson stuff seeped deeper and 
deeper into the fibers. 
</P>
<P>
She was a gem. There was no doubt in anyone's mind that pounding waves of shock 
and nausea were sweeping over her, but she still managed to assure me that 
everything was all right and that accidents will happen, choke, gasp, as she 
grabbed a bottle of white wine, a glass of water and a dry towel and pounced on 
the stain like Bubba Paris pounces on a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
I switched to soda water and spent the rest of the evening babbling apologies 
and offering to atone by killing myself. 
</P>
<P>
The stain came out. Not immediately, and not all at once, but it came out. I 
found that out a week later when I called to ask about it and offer my services 
as a slave. 
</P>
<P>
She told me she had discovered that white wine is just great for getting out 
red wine stains in the carpet. The trick, she said, was to get to the spill 
immediately, blot furiously, douse it with white wine, blot it again, soak it 
with water and, yes, blot it again. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that this was part of her body of practical knowledge probably saved 
her life by preventing her heart from stopping as she saw the Cabernet 
cascading toward the floor. But how many unfortunates are going to lapse into a 
shock-induced coma on New Year's Eve because one of their guests accidentally 
grinds a chocolate truffle into the Persian rug? Well, they needn't. A bit of 
selective hosting and the quick availability of the world's greatest 
do-it-yourself home spot-removal emergency kit should see you through those 
ghastly moments when somebody flicks glowing cigar ash onto the floor, crazy 
Uncle Arthur starts a food fight with the cherry cheesecake or somebody's child 
wolfs a dozen brownies, gropes his way to the very center of the $2,000 Chinese 
rug and urps. 
</P>
<P>
Don Whitley has seen it all. He's the owner of The Carpet Beaters, a 
carpet-cleaning business based in Orange, and his life is a daily battle 
against the evil forces of carpet-staining miscellany. And, fortunately, he's 
not stingy about sharing his knowledge, particularly if it involves what might 
be called seasonal stains. 
</P>
<P>
First, a few general procedures: 
</P>
<P>
* Know your carpet. Most modern carpets, Whitley said, are synthetic -- nylon, 
polyester or olefin for example -- and will resist staining. Wool carpets, 
however, are organic and porous and hold a stain more tenaciously. The methods 
of removing stains, however, are generally the same for all carpet types. 
</P>
<P>
* Assemble your emergency spot kit. It should contain four spray bottles, one 
containing one part distilled vinegar to two parts water, one with one part 
clear dish washing detergent to about 10 parts water, one containing water 
only, and one containing a common degreaser, such as Fantastik. Also in the kit 
should be a large spoon for scraping up stains (use the edge like a squeegee) 
and white paper towels for blotting. The kit should not contain chlorine 
bleach, which will strip the dye from synthetic carpets and dissolve wool. 
</P>
<P>
* For large spills, said Whitley, blot up the excess, then place four or five 
folds of paper towels over the spill, then place a book wrapped in foil over 
the towels. Then stack a few more books on top of that and leave it for 24 
hours. The weight will help the towels absorb the stain. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't wait. Get to work removing the stain immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Now, on to a few specific holiday stains and how to wage war on them: 
</P>
<P>
* Red wine: Just like my gallant hostess did it. White wine neutralizes the red 
wine, according to Whitley. Blot it, rinse it with water and blot it again. 
</P>
<P>
* Gravy or other grease stains. The degreaser comes into play here. Soak the 
stain with it, rinse with water and blot it up. 
</P>
<P>
* Candle wax. This technique gets a bit tricky, but it's also ingenious. Use a 
hot-air hair dryer on the spot to soften the wax, then scrape it off with a 
spoon. If residue is left, cover the spot with a piece of brown paper bag and 
apply a conventional iron to the paper. The heat will cause the wax to melt and 
be absorbed into the paper. 
</P>
<P>
* Christmas tree stains. These are the brown spots that can seep into the 
carpet if you over-water your tree. Rub it with the vinegar solution in your 
emergency spot kit and blot. 
</P>
<P>
* Chocolate. Scrape off the excess with the edge of a spoon, then apply the 
degreaser and rub it in with your finger to liquefy the chocolate. Squeegee the 
liquid off with a spoon, then rinse the area with water and blot. 
</P>
<P>
* Cigarette burns. Nightmarish, but possible to defeat. If the burn occurs on 
synthetic carpet, the fabric melts; on wool, it singes. In either case, wrap a 
small piece of 150 grit sandpaper around a finger and rub the spot. In most 
cases, Whitley said, this will remove the darkened burn spot. 
</P>
<P>
Other stains require a professional to remove them. Whitley said stubborn 
materials such as mustard, rust, nail polish and shoe polish often need the 
touch of a pro, but they will usually come out. 
</P>
<P>
Stains made by anything containing food dye, however -- fruit punch or juices 
extracted from berries, for instance -- often are indelible, and the only way 
to restore the carpet is to resort to what Whitley calls "surgery and 
patching." Regardless of the reasons you decide to call in a pro, however, 
Whitley said it's best to make sure you're getting the genuine article. He 
suggests asking friends for personal recommendations, or asking the carpet 
cleaners if they are members of a trade association, such as the Carpet 
Cleaners Institute, which governs the western states. 
</P>
<P>
To my mind, however, prevention is best. That's why I suggest serving your 
Merlot in unbreakable, no-spill Donald Duck drinkee mugs. Look at it this way: 
What's more elegant, guests sipping their New Year's toasts from K mart 
stemware on linoleum or guests swilling out of cartoon mugs and standing in 
deep-pile nylon up to their ankles? 
</P>
<P>
Me, I'm going to knock back a couple of glasses of Calistoga and hit the sack 
early.

ASK THE HANDYMAN: A LITTLE CONDENSED MILK HELPS A BIT WHEN DRILLING PORCELAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I'd like to put a new towel bar in a bathroom with old porcelain tile 
on the walls. Is there a special drill bit I should use for porcelain or can I 
get by with a standard bit? 
</P>
<P>
A.K., San Juan Capistrano 
</P>
<P>
Answer: "There is a special bit for porcelain, but unless you're going to be 
working with it a lot I wouldn't get it because it's a little pricey," says Pam 
Idoine of Martenet Hardware in Anaheim. "It might be better to try the old 
handyman's trick of using a variable speed drill, a high-speed bit or a carbide 
bit and condensed milk, which you pour onto the site as a lubricant. 
</P>
<P>
"Start out at a slow speed and gently accelerate the drill. Don't push it into 
the porcelain, just give it a little pressure, and keep it moist with the milk. 
I don't know what it is about the condensed milk, but I've tried it in those 
situations and I haven't had any chipping." 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have both navel and Valencia orange trees that have recently been plagued 
by white flies that nest on the underside of the leaves. I've been advised to 
spray a mixture of insecticide and dormant and summer oil on the leaves, but 
that doesn't seem to help. What can I do? 
</P>
<P>
W.B., Los Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
A: "To get rid of white flies requires a lot of work and vigilance," says Dee 
Solomon, a fruit tree trouble-shooter from Santa Ana. "Try filling a spray 
bottle with water and a 10% solution of everyday dish soap. Spray all over the 
tree, getting both top and bottom of the leaves. The important thing is you 
have to keep doing it, every day if necessary, until they're not around. 
</P>
<P>
"Other things you can do are keeping the tree properly fed and pruned. When 
it's weak, it's more susceptible to parasites. Also, make sure the plants 
around the trees aren't afflicted with the flies. Use the solution wherever you 
see them." 
</P>
<P>
Q: I foolishly used some Lime-Away to clean the marble floor in our entry hall. 
It left heavy dark smudges in numerous spots. Is there any way to get these 
off? 
</P>
<P>
L.S., Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
A: "What may have happened is the marble wasn't completely sealed after it was 
installed," says Ken Kettering of Del Piso Brick and Tile in Anaheim. "Most 
people think marble is a very hard, resilient rock, but in its natural state 
it's really very porous and can be easily stained. There is a pumice mixture on 
the market that you can use to bring the stain up to the surface, but it's not 
easy to work with. If you're really concerned about it, it may be best to call 
in a professional marble cleaner." 
</P>
<P>
Q: I've got a hanging fixture on a polished brass chain that I'd like to move 
to another room. However, I want to know how to remove a couple of the links 
without damaging their finish. 
</P>
<P>
M.T., Orange 
</P>
<P>
A: "There is no perfect way to do it. Even the pros will scratch the finish on 
a chain," says David Galluccio of Harbor Lites in Costa Mesa. "Your best bet is 
to use a good set of chain pliers, which are usually available in hardware or 
lighting stores and run about $10. They make it easier than trying to do it 
with a standard pair of pliers, but they're not perfect. Just be patient and be 
careful." 
</P>
<P>
Q: I've heard a lot of pros and cons about glue guns. Some people tell me not 
to use them if I'm working with wood, others say they work great with wood. 
Who's right, and are there different types of glue sticks for different jobs? 
</P>
<P>
C.D., Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
A: "I know of just two types of glue, one that dries clear and another that 
dries white," says Robert Valdez of Clarke Dye Hardware in Santa Ana. "As for 
what works better with wood, it depends on the job. The glue from glue sticks 
will be more rubbery and you can disconnect two pieces of wood if you needed 
to. When you use wood glue, however, it sticks and stays. You'd better like 
your job as it is after it dries."

A garden book will help you through the dreary days of winter. And there's an 
abundant crop of recent books available. 
</P>
<P>
A delightful little book is "A Bouquet of Flowers: Sweet Thoughts, Recipes, and 
Gifts From the Garden, With 'The Language of Flowers' " by Barbara Milo Ohrbach 
(Clarkson Potter, $9.95). The book's title tells it all. The recipes include 
one for scented note paper. 
</P>
<P>

HEAD OF CRA TO QUIT; WILL GET LARGE PAYOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

John Tuite, the embattled administrator of the powerful Los Angeles Community 
Redevelopment Agency, said Friday that he will resign from his $147,000-a-year 
job in exchange for a mammoth $765,375 wages and benefits package -- believed 
to be the largest such settlement in the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
The complex deal, which ends weeks of speculation over Tuite's future, was 
pieced together during two weeks of negotiations involving the CRA board and 
Mayor Tom Bradley's office. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for Tuite, who has run the agency since 1986, to step down 
on April 30 -- nearly two years before his current contract ends. The way was 
also cleared for new leadership of the agency at a particularly uncertain 
period of its existence. 
</P>
<P>
Tuite's announcement came just two months after the ouster of city Planning 
Director Ken Topping, whom the City Council awarded $220,000 in payments for 
consulting work after he agreed to step down. 
</P>
<P>
Both moves were seen as part of a political house-cleaning of top development 
officials who had fallen out of favor with the Bradley Administration. But some 
City Hall observers questioned why Tuite's removal was necessary, especially at 
so high a cost. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible . . . outrageous," said City Councilman Nate Holden. "What I 
think of that settlement -- you couldn't print it. I am shocked that the CRA 
would pay $700,000 to get rid of a guy that is doing a good job, as far as I am 
concerned. . . . It is a misappropriation of the taxpayers. It is a giveaway." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Councilwoman Gloria Molina, head of the council's CRA oversight 
committee, said Molina was upset at the terms and would investigate whether the 
council could reject them. But CRA spokesman Marc Littman said the deal does 
not need council approval. 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, Tuite was said to be under pressure to resign because of the 
CRA's role in promoting high-rise office development downtown over the needs of 
low-income neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the criticism, according to insiders, came from Deputy Mayor Mark 
Fabiani, who worked behind the scenes to depose Tuite. Although Fabiani could 
not be reached for comment, sources said the deputy mayor held Tuite 
responsible for creating a huge skyline while placing little emphasis on 
providing low-cost apartments and social programs. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Tuite said that after 4 1/2 years of carrying out the pro-growth 
philosophies of the Bradley Administration, he is now being asked to take the 
fall for ideals that are no longer popular. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course you feel the heat," a placid Tuite, 58, told reporters Friday after 
a two-hour, closed-door meeting of the CRA board in which the final details of 
the settlement were worked out. "I expected the job to be a pressured one. 
There's always a question, how long do you want to stay in jobs like that." 
</P>
<P>
Tuite said he has received unflagging support from Bradley, his resignation was 
voluntary and that the CRA has made monumental strides in establishing 
affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
"The most recent statement from the mayor's office is that I have the job as 
long as I want it," Tuite said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the CRA's role in recent years, Tuite said: "We have not only developed 
downtown and our neighborhood areas -- particularly San Pedro, North Hollywood, 
Little Tokyo -- but also, because of that economic development, we have been 
able to run . . . the largest affordable housing program in the western United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"As the head of the largest redevelopment agency in the country, you expect 
criticism from all sides," Tuite added. "You're not going to please people." 
</P>
<P>
The CRA, with its current yearly operating budget of $267 million, is 
administering 18 redevelopment and revitalization projects throughout Los 
Angeles. The agency uses property taxes that otherwise would go to the county 
to foster new growth, often through low-interest loans or subsidies to 
developers. It has been credited with helping shape the downtown skyline in 
recent years and is undertaking a 30-year, $922-million overhaul of the 
commercial core of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Under Tuite, the CRA has constructed and rehabilitated roughly 6,700 new homes 
and apartments since 1986, Littman said. About two-thirds of them have been 
designed for low- and moderate-income people. At the same time, the city's 
overall housing shortage among poor families has grown, in part because of the 
rapidly rising property values of recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley released an official statement crediting Tuite with putting a "human 
face" on redevelopment, in part because the CRA now spends more than one-third 
of its budget -- roughly $100 million a year -- on housing. 
</P>
<P>
"No other local agency can match that record," Bradley said. "Time and again, I 
have turned to John Tuite and the CRA for help in housing the homeless, persons 
with AIDS, large families, senior citizens and the many others who can't afford 
decent and safe housing." 
</P>
<P>
Community activists, however, sharply criticized Tuite's record on building 
affordable housing. Norton Halper, a longtime critic of the CRA, said: "Under 
the direction of John Tuite, the CRA has done the least they've had to do and 
has never been compassionate on the issue of low-income housing. I think it's 
disgraceful." 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Tuite will receive a check by Monday for $443,000, 
including $212,375 in salary through 1992, $162,000 in severance pay and 
$50,000 in bonus money based on newly completed job evaluations. Those 
evaluations included two 4% raises that were calculated into Tuite's $136,000 
salary before the deal was completed. The raises brought his final salary to 
$147,000. 
</P>
<P>
The $443,000 payment will be made out of the CRA's current salary budget, said 
CRA attorney Murray Kane. In addition, Tuite will receive at least $16,000 in 
accrued sick time when he steps down in April, plus anywhere from $292,000 to 
$312,000 in added pension benefits to be paid over the next 30 years, Kane 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Deputy Controller Anthony Miera said that in his 25 years with the city 
he has never seen a settlement approaching the magnitude of Tuite's, which he 
called "huge." 
</P>
<P>
CRA Chairman Jim Wood, who joined Tuite in meeting with reporters after the 
announcement, said the board's unanimous support of the settlement was 
unrelated to the recent "political rumbles." Wood insisted that the board 
sought Tuite's resignation only after learning that Tuite planned to resign at 
the end of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Tuite's plan to leave the agency in two years would have left the CRA without 
permanent leadership during a particularly difficult time in its dealings with 
the city and county over the future scale of growth downtown, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
"If John wanted his contract renewed, we would have . . . happily renewed his 
contract," Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said the size of the settlement was dictated by the terms of Tuite's 
contract and commented, "We probably won't sign a contract like this with the 
next administrator." 
</P>
<P>
However, he justified the size of the settlement by saying it pales compared 
with the scope of the issues now facing the CRA. The major item of concern, he 
said, is the current $750 million cap on CRA expenditures downtown, which the 
agency hopes to raise to $5 billion in years ahead despite expected opposition 
from county officials. 
</P>
<P>
The cap, negotiated with county officials, is intended to limit the amount of 
property tax money that is diverted from the county's budget to promote 
downtown growth. 
</P>
<P>
"Against the cap issue, this is an insignificant amount of money," Wood said of 
Tuite's settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Another senior CRA official, who asked not to be identified, disputed Wood's 
characterization of the settlement by saying that Tuite has been "on the outs 
with Wood and Fabiani for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim Wood wanted him out on his own terms," without interference from the 
mayor's office, the senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuite was the senior federal housing official for the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development in Los Angeles before leaving that job in 1983 to 
start a development consulting firm that specialized in housing. He said he 
plans to resume that work. 
</P>
<P>
City Hall insiders are speculating about whether Wood also will step down as 
part of the shake-up of the agency, but Wood denied such reports.

ISRAEL FACING $35-BILLION TAB TO SETTLE SOVIETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With record numbers of Soviet Jewish immigrants streaming in, Israel faces 
enormous costs in absorbing them and will have to ask other countries and 
institutions for financial help, a top immigration official warned here Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Simcha Dinitz, executive chairman of the Jewish Agency and a former ambassador 
to Washington, said at a news conference that a staggering $35 billion will be 
needed to pay the costs of absorbing the immigrants -- providing housing and 
jobs for 1 million Soviet Jews expected to join the current Israeli population 
of about 4.5 million in the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
Dinitz said Israel must take "drastic steps" to handle the unprecedented number 
of immigrants. Other countries and institutions, such as the United States, 
Germany, the European Community and the World Bank, will have to be asked for 
"humanitarian" help to finance the immigration. 
</P>
<P>
But that will not be enough, he warned, adding that during the next three years 
Israelis will have to tighten their belts, reducing their own living standard 
by as much as 25%. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has already responded to an earlier plea from Israel, 
agreeing in October to provide $400 million in loan guarantees for housing 
Soviet Jewish immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The quasi-governmental Jewish Agency is in charge of organizing Jewish 
immigration to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Israel has received the largest number of immigrants in one year 
since 1949, the year after Israeli independence, with the number expected to 
reach 200,000 around the end of this month. In 1949, 239,964 Jews arrived in 
Israel -- most of them Ashkenazic Jews from Europe in the aftermath of the 
Holocaust and World War II, but many of them Sephardic Jews from elsewhere in 
the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the tide has swung heavily toward the Soviet Union as the main 
source of immigrants to Israel. With Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
easing of emigration restrictions, what was once a trickle has turned into a 
flood. 
</P>
<P>
This month is proving to be the largest in the history of Jewish immigration -- 
with 35,000 Jews expected from the Soviet Union, Dinitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime next week, the 200,000th Jewish immigrant since Jan. 1 will arrive, he 
said, pointing out that in one 24-hour period this week, 5,000 Jews landed at 
Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion International Airport via two flights hourly from 
Budapest, Hungary; Bucharest, Romania, and Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
And there is no letup in sight: The Jewish Agency is saying that at least 
400,000 immigrants are expected next year, most of them from the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The task of housing the immigrants and finding jobs for them falls to the 
Immigrant Absorption Ministry, a Cabinet office. Dinitz suggested that the 
Immigrant Absorption Ministry has failed to keep up with the enormous task of 
housing the new arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
The view of the Jewish Agency's executive chairman squares with the common 
judgment here that housing and employing Soviet immigrants is the most pressing 
domestic issue facing Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Dinitz, formerly a professional diplomat, said the government's housing plan 
calls for building 45,000 apartments, 15,000 prefab units, 15,000 trailer homes 
and 33,000 mini-trailers. 
</P>
<P>
"But the execution of the plan was slow," Dinitz said, with only 27,000 
apartment units being built, only prefab infrastructure installed (water, 
electricity and ground preparation) and only 950 of the larger trailer homes in 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
The construction issue is a volatile one in Israel. Housing Minister Ariel 
Sharon is engaged in a political fight with Immigrant Absorption Minister 
Yitzhak Peretz and the powerful trade unions over Sharon's argument that Israel 
should import trailers and even foreign construction workers to meet the demand 
for new housing. 
</P>
<P>
Dinitz said that Israel is "paying for lost months" in creating housing, and he 
proposed that the government reverse the recent trend toward privatization and 
take over housing construction from private industry, even though it would not 
be "popular." 
</P>
<P>
Until proper housing is available, he said, the immigrants will be housed in 
army camps, hostels and hotels. He denied reports that some may have to be 
housed in tents. 
</P>
<P>
The housing shortage has led to some visible protests. A group of Soviet 
immigrants with no place to live demonstrated by setting up tents for a few 
days earlier this month in the southern city of Beersheba. 
</P>
<P>
As to whether the immigration rate should be slowed to permit a proper 
absorption of the newcomers, Dinitz declared: "I will never urge the 
postponement of a single immigrant." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what will happen tomorrow," he said of Moscow's current policy of 
allowing Jews to emigrate from the Soviet Union after decades of emigration 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Jews are leaving, Dinitz said, because of the opportunity and the 
"worsening" of their nation's economic and political conditions, which could 
lead to increased anti-Semitism and other dangers to minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Dinitz said the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Soviet Asian republics might 
also be turned against Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Some immigrants from Azerbaijan, he said, had been warned by local Muslims 
before leaving: "After the (Christian) Armenians, you Jews come next." 
</P>
<P>
The bright side of the immigration picture, Dinitz said, is the high proportion 
of professionals among the Soviet Jewish arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
He denied that incoming Soviet Jews are being funneled to the Israeli-occupied 
territories, a charge made by some Arab countries and a concern to the United 
States. The U.S. pledge of $400 million in loan guarantees was made contingent 
on a promise by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government that none of the 
money would be spent in the West Bank or Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Once Palestinians get used to the idea that the Jewish state, bolstered by 1 
million new immigrants, cannot be "driven into the sea," Dinitz said, then 
"that could create a situation where meaningful negotiations can take place."

GILBERT LINDSAY, 1ST L.A. BLACK COUNCILMAN, DIES; 
</P>
<P>
CITY POLITICS: LONGTIME REPRESENTATIVE OF 9TH DISTRICT WAS 90. HE IS CREDITED 
WITH HELPING REVITALIZE DOWNTOWN. 
</P>

<P>
Gilbert W. Lindsay, the flamboyant politician who worked his way up from city 
janitor to become Los Angeles' first black City Council member and one of its 
most powerful local elected officials, died early Friday. Lindsay, who helped 
fashion downtown Los Angeles into a major metropolitan center, was 90. 
</P>
<P>
Left speechless and nearly motionless by a massive stroke on Sept. 2, the 
veteran politician died shortly after 2 a.m. at the Queen of Angels-Hollywood 
Presbyterian Medical Center in Hollywood, hospital Vice President Timothy Ogata 
said. The official cause of death will be determined later, but Ogata said 
Lindsay's already weakened health had deteriorated in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
"Councilman Lindsay was a dynamic force in Los Angeles who opened the doors of 
political power to all residents with his appointment to the City Council in 
January of 1963," said Mayor Tom Bradley, who once served beside Lindsay on the 
council. The mayor ordered all flags on city property to be flown at half 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 27 years -- and even at his death -- Lindsay represented the 
sprawling, contradictory 9th Council District, which stretches from the 
sparkling skyscrapers of the downtown financial district to the impoverished 
neighborhoods of South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The gravel-voiced councilman, although only 5 feet, 3 inches tall, was a giant 
among politicians in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Born at the turn of the century in Mississippi, where he worked in the cotton 
fields, he was one of the last in a line of colorful old-style backslappers who 
openly helped his friends, remembered his enemies and dished up large doses of 
hyperbole. Early in his career, he once belittled his fellow council members as 
people who would "gag on a gnat and swallow a camel" after they had taken time 
out from city matters to force him to remove several blue lights on his 
city-owned car that they considered tacky. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay's death is sure to create a power vacuum and a scramble among 
politicians eyeing his seat on the council. 
</P>
<P>
A special election to fill the vacant seat will probably be held in April, 
coinciding with regularly scheduled municipal elections. In the meantime, the 
chief legislative analyst's office will handle the business of Lindsay's 
district. 
</P>
<P>
The self-proclaimed "Emperor of the Great 9th," Lindsay regarded the 
rejuvenation of the downtown area of his district as his greatest 
accomplishment. Indeed, many see today's skyline as a tribute to Lindsay 
because of his role in transforming parts of downtown Los Angeles from 
nondescript, aging buildings to an impressive skyline of high-rises and elegant 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay remained a vigorous proponent of growth even as younger politicians 
began to question the impact of development on traffic and air quality. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview in 1975, Lindsay spoke of what might have been. "If I was 20 
years younger I would be governor or U.S. senator from California," he said. "I 
am too old now -- I got lazy and old. When you get through swinging that mop, 
you get tired and old." 
</P>
<P>
But not too old to keep plugging on. Grief-stricken by the 1984 death of his 
wife of 48 years, Theresa, he nonetheless sought and won reelection in 1985. He 
suffered a mild stroke in October, 1988, but was reelected in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay never wanted to retire, in spite of his periodic dozing in his seat 
during council meetings that became the object of jokes in City Hall. Even in 
1981 when he was 80 and running for his fifth term, his campaign rhetoric 
remained feisty: "When I find good new leadership in the interest of the people 
I sure enough will step aside," he said, taking off his bifocals and shaking 
them for emphasis. "But I don't think three of them (candidates) is worth half 
of me." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the decline of his final years took a toll. After the first 
stroke in 1988, Lindsay's absences from council sessions increased and his 
ability to handle routine council business decreased. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks before his death, council members were forced to grapple with the 
issue of whether to remove him from office. This led to a sad incident in which 
relatives had Lindsay transferred from a hospital in Inglewood to another 
facility within Los Angeles city limits to make him less vulnerable to efforts 
to unseat him. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, an ugly battle over Lindsay's estate erupted after it was 
revealed that a 39-year-old former girlfriend had gained control of many of his 
real estate holdings. In a lawsuit aimed at recovering the property, Lindsay's 
stepson, Herbert Howard, described the councilman as senile. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who drew up Lindsay's will and is representing 
Howard, said Friday that the suit will continue and possibly be combined with 
the probating of the will. 
</P>
<P>
But the decline and disillusion of the later years were overshadowed Friday as 
glowing tributes to the politician were voiced from City Hall to the 
restaurants and shoeshine parlors of Central Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"The legacy Councilman Lindsay leaves behind is one of care, compassion and 
commitment to all 9th District constituents -- with whom he shared a very 
special relationship," said council President John Ferraro. "The 'Emperor of 
the Great 9th' is dead, but he will always remain in our memories, in our 
hearts and our love." 
</P>
<P>
"Gil Lindsay worked as hard for Vermont and Central as he did for 1st and 
Spring," Bradley added, dismissing critics who said Lindsay catered to 
big-money developers to the detriment of his poorer constituents. "He was a 
champion of the little man. We've lost a great friend and a great servant of 
the city." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay had become a political force commanding the attention and respect of 
power brokers, whom he had once cleaned up after while working as a janitor. It 
was surely a heady experience for a black man born in Jasper County, Miss., 
"six miles from the nearest whistle-stop," he once said. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed that Lindsay was sometimes in awe of how far he had come -- from 
picking cotton to mingling with heads of state. 
</P>
<P>
Reminiscing during a dinner in his honor in 1983, he talked about a trip he had 
made years before to Tokyo and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
"The people there would rise and bow to me and I would rise and bow to them. 
They thought I was (a) king. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And all the crew was laughing, and I was laughing, but they didn't know I was 
laughing at something different than what they were laughing about. As I sailed 
into the sea, I was thinking about down in Mississippi. The fields that I was 
picking cotton in in my mid-teens, you know. And here I was sailing the China 
Sea in a big yacht, as a guest! Oh baby, that's a long way from Mississippi! 
</P>
<P>
"One thought came to my mind . . . you know one can be whatever one wants to 
be, just believe that you can make it." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay came to Los Angeles from the Mississippi cotton fields in the late 
1920s and started working for the Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to scrub toilets for the city of Los Angeles with a mop -- that was my 
job," he once said. "I had so many toilets to clean every night. I was lower 
than a janitor -- I had the lowest job you can give a human being." 
</P>
<P>
From there, he took the Civil Service exam and became a clerk. He sat in a 
basement office by himself because his superiors did not want him to sit with 
whites. He became involved in grass-roots Democratic and labor politics. He 
became so entrenched that his DWP superiors called on him to help turn out the 
black vote on various bond issues. As the 1940s and '50s approached, Lindsay 
"was the man to see," recalled former Councilman Dave Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Robert Farrell, remembering that blacks were barred from many hotels 
and motels when he and his mother arrived from New Jersey in 1953, said Lindsay 
helped them find temporary shelter until they could get settled. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay's prowess in producing the black vote came to the attention of 
then-college professor Kenneth Hahn, who was getting ready to run for the City 
Council in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
"Gilbert would take me from place to place on Central Avenue when it was the 
Wilshire Boulevard of the black community," Hahn recalled years later. "He knew 
every merchant, barber shop, every minister of every church, and he opened 
doors for me." 
</P>
<P>
Hahn won and, with Lindsay's help, later won a seat on the Board of Supervisors 
in 1952. Lindsay later became Hahn's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn did not forget Lindsay's important role in his political career. When 
former Los Angeles Councilman Ed Roybal won election to Congress in 1962, 
Supervisor Hahn and his brother, Councilman Gordon Hahn, supported Lindsay for 
the vacant council seat. They knew that whoever was appointed in the interim 
would have an automatic advantage in the upcoming election. 
</P>
<P>
With the appointment in January, 1963, Lindsay made history by becoming Los 
Angeles' first black council member. Later that same year, Tom Bradley became 
the first black elected to the council. Lindsay went on to be elected to eight 
successive terms. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay said later he had no problem seeing his appointment as a quid pro quo: 
"I'd helped everybody get elected around here . . . and I thought I should do 
something for myself." 
</P>
<P>
A politician who was weaned on the "you-scratch-my-back-I'll-scratch-yours" 
school of politics, Lindsay was openly disdainful of the post-Watergate 
reforms, such as the laws that required elected officials to report the sources 
of their campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Regularly denouncing such measures as "garbage," he said in 1980 that "my 
people gave me the money to do any damned thing I want to do with it, as long 
as it enhances me," he said, failing to note that the bulk of his campaign 
contributions came from downtown big business, not residents and voters of the 
district. "And that means wearing good clothes, that means making good 
appearances, that means eating well or anything I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
He was always quick to point out that he was returned to office each term 
without major competition, saying with a smile, "The people out there aren't 
crazy. They must know something I'm doing right." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Lindsay was the first African-American on the City Council was a 
source of pride to many blacks who liked Lindsay's penchant for being frank 
enough to say just what was on his mind. Other blacks looked at Lindsay as an 
anachronism, his often outrageous speeches and rambling lectures a throwback to 
earlier times. He was "the type who talked a good game but always did just what 
the downtown bossmen wanted him to do," said one critic. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, challengers criticized Lindsay for his constant attention to the 
downtown business district, saying it was to the detriment of the district 
south of the Santa Monica Freeway, one of the poorest areas in the city. But 
the argument never stuck with the largely elderly voters of that district, who 
consistently returned Lindsay to office by a large margin. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay usually supported traditional Democratic Party candidates and causes, 
but he was more conservative than many of the Democrats on the council. In the 
early years he often clashed with Bradley, once claiming that Bradley and his 
"liberal" friends were backing a Lindsay opponent. Once Bradley became mayor, 
Lindsay became a staunch supporter. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay was always quick with brutally blunt remarks about the facts of 
political life. When public officials were complaining that they had not been 
provided tickets for the 1984 Summer Olympics, Lindsay, as president of of the 
Coliseum Commission, said he already had plenty of complimentary tickets 
stashed away. 
</P>
<P>
"I want all I can get," he told a reporter. "Who doesn't?" 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion he was quoted as referring to the derelicts that gather 
downtown as "bums" and suggested that they be put out of sight during the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how many hackles his comments raised or how sheepishly he often 
apologized, Lindsay knew that time had made him untouchable; he was running for 
no other office and he could not be beaten in the seat he had. 
</P>
<P>
Although during his last years on the council Lindsay was increasingly 
criticized for being out of touch with his constituents, when it came to 
downtown, he still knew how to play hardball. 
</P>
<P>
In one of his last major coups, he pushed through a narrow decision in late 
1988 that handed a $200-million project on city-owned land in Little Tokyo to a 
developer who had cut several of Lindsay's political friends in on the deal. It 
was vintage Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
Often, politics was simply a matter of friendship for this 
crusty-yet-sentimental man. 
</P>
<P>
He wept openly when council members honored him on his 80th birthday in a 
ceremony in council chambers. A few months later, he was asked if he planned to 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should I quit? I love it," Lindsay said. "Baby, I'm working for humanity." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay will be eulogized in two memorial services: Thursday at the Angeles 
Funeral Home, 3875 Crenshaw Blvd., where his body will lie in an open casket 
for public viewing, and Friday at the Victory Baptist Church, 4802 McKinley 
Ave. Burial will follow at the Evergreen Cemetery in Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Howard, his stepson, said several people have mentioned the possibility of 
having Lindsay's body lie in state in the City Hall rotunda, though no city 
official has made such a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone were to offer it, I'd accept," Howard said. "I know Dad would love 
it."

A trolley car rammed into another trolley that was unloading commuters Friday 
morning in an underground station on the edge of Boston Common, injuring 33 
people, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the moving trolley tested positive for alcohol in his blood. 
</P>
<P>
The accident involving the Green Line trains occurred at Arlington Station. The 
Green Line is one of four subway lines operated by the Massachusetts Bay 
Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
"I just screamed out: 'Everybody hang on and get down. We're going to hit,' " 
passenger Steve DePaula said. "It just seemed like seconds later we smashed 
into the trolley in front of us. People just went flying everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
DePaula said the moving trolley was going faster than usual. But Thomas Glynn, 
the transit authority's general manager, said officials did not know how fast 
the second car was going. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking at the lady across from me; next thing I knew, the lights went 
out and she was on the floor," said Ernest Jones, a passenger on the stationary 
trolley. "I saw one man . . . on the floor on his back, crying, obviously in 
agony, hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the moving trolley told officials his brakes failed, Glynn said. 
Both operators, whose names were not released, underwent drug and alcohol tests 
immediately after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"The driver in the rear car, the car that did the hitting, . . . was found to 
test positive for alcohol," a transit spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The driver was suspended without pay pending the outcome of an investigation, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 33 people injured were treated and released at hospitals. One 
person was in intensive care at New England Medical Center.

GLOBAL ECONOMY: IN MESSAGES BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, THEY LET IT BE KNOWN THAT 
THEY ARE EAGER TO RESUME LUCRATIVE DEALS WITH BAGHDAD ONCE THE GULF CRISIS IS

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An odd counterpoint to the grim march toward next month's war ultimatum is the 
optimistic urge among Iraq's global economic partners to ensure that, after the 
Persian Gulf crisis ends, they will be able to resume lucrative business deals 
that developed here during the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
The hopes, expressed both publicly and in private messages from businesses and 
governments, are perhaps the only glimmer on the otherwise gray horizon of 
Iraqi foreign relations. 
</P>
<P>
Given the apocalyptic scenario painted by both Washington and Baghdad in the 
event the conflict over Kuwait turns into full-scale war, it has been difficult 
to imagine making plans for the future. The United Nations has set a Jan. 15 
deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait and authorized the use of military 
force after that date to liberate the sheikdom. 
</P>
<P>
Indications that there may be life after the crisis are important to Iraq, 
diplomats speculate, and might encourage Baghdad to compromise on its decision 
to hold on to Kuwait at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
The optimistic ones among foreign observers here believe that Iraq's primary 
concern is no longer to keep Kuwait, but to survive the crisis intact -- this 
despite the unbroken string of defiant announcements that Iraq will never 
abandon what it has designated as its 19th province. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq will not budge if it believes it is going to be destroyed no matter what 
it does," said a Western diplomat here. "There must be some sign that its 
relations abroad can be normalized." 
</P>
<P>
A few soothing messages from abroad have come to light in recent days. Toshiki 
Kaifu, the Japanese prime minister, sent a personal letter to Iraqi leader 
Saddam Hussein urging him to obey the U.N. Security Council order and retreat 
from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu included in his message a promise that Japan would resume its "previous 
cooperative relationship" with Iraq once the crisis has dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
A visiting Soviet delegation is discussing the issue of Soviet technicians who, 
because of the contracts they signed with Baghdad, have not yet been allowed to 
leave despite the threat of war. But the meetings are also laying the 
groundwork for future economic relations between the two countries, Eastern 
European diplomats say. 
</P>
<P>
The delegation from Moscow includes the head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's 
Middle East department, the deputy chairman of the governing Council of 
Ministers and the deputy minister of oil and gas. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the dealings involve a joint agreement for up to 600 Soviet technicians 
to stay in Iraq despite the danger and the effects of the U.N. embargo on trade 
with the country. The Soviets "welcomed Iraq's decision to allow Soviet experts 
to leave or stay in the country as they wish," said a communique issued after 
the most recent meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Iraq had indicated that the Soviets must fulfill their 
contracts. But 900 Soviet workers have flown home during the past week, leaving 
about 1,400 in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The economies of Turkey and Iraq are tightly bound, and both countries have 
sent messages of assurance that long-range relations can be friendly once the 
crisis is over, diplomats say. Iraq is especially eager to reduce tensions with 
Turkey: In the event of war, its neighbor might serve as a springboard for a 
U.S.-led attack from the north. Also, the sources of one of Iraq's main rivers 
lie in Turkey. With a new dam that was completed in the fall, Turkey can 
literally turn off the tap that would affect much of Iraq's water supply. 
</P>
<P>
"Iraq is mad at Turkey, but in the long run, it must promote good relations," 
said an Arab diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Before its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Iraq had offered a rare Third World 
bonanza for industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
During its eight-year war with Iran, Iraq was a major international weapons 
purchaser. It bought millions of dollars of arms from the Soviet Union as well 
as France and the United States. Over the years, it has tried to buy the means 
of producing chemical weapons -- from Germany and Switzerland -- and nuclear 
weapons -- notably from France. 
</P>
<P>
Baghdad also has bought missiles from the Soviet Union, China and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
After the Iran-Iraq War, Baghdad engaged in a hasty scheme meant to rebuild an 
economy strained by the drawn-out conflict and to dive headlong into 
industrialization. It dusted off ambitious development plans, and several 
European countries along with Japan rushed to help finance and participate in 
them. 
</P>
<P>
A contract for a new $1.5-billion oil refinery to supply fuel to Baghdad and 
central Iraq was set to be signed early in 1991. Japan and Italy were to 
provide designs and equipment, and Czechoslovakia skilled labor. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese companies were helping modernize Iraqi telecommunications and along 
with Italy were constructing a new oil pipeline that would pass through Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
European countries, notably France, Italy and Germany, modernized power plants, 
oil pipelines and steel mills. The Soviet Union was involved in developing oil 
fields and updating power plants. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was a relative latecomer to the Iraqi market, but Washington 
had signaled an intention to compete by participating in the November, 1991, 
Baghdad trade fair, especially in development of Iraqi oil production. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of U.S. exports to Iraq during 1989, the last year for which full data 
is available, consisted of agricultural goods, mainly wheat. In 1989, the 
United States exported $1.2 billion worth of products to Iraq and imported $2.4 
billion in oil. 
</P>
<P>
Even less-developed countries found a place in the Iraqi sun. Turkey, 
Yugoslavia and India won contracts for road, bridge and dam projects and, along 
with poorer nations like Egypt and Bangladesh, exported cheap labor to work on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"It is hard for countries doing business with Iraq to just turn away," said a 
European economist. "Everybody would like to come back." 
</P>
<P>
Iraq was something of a 1980s rarity among Third World countries. Unlike most 
Latin American and African countries, it had money to invest, or at least a 
steady source of oil income to help finance big projects. 
</P>
<P>
"The war with Iran left Iraq running behind the other gulf states," said a 
Western European diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's vision of itself as a kind of Ruhr Valley of the Arab world also led to 
headlong efforts to industrialize with all the latest technology -- a windfall 
to eager Western and Japanese traders. "Even the Soviets would sublet contracts 
to Western firms in order to satisfy the Iraqi demand for the latest," said the 
West European diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of foreign businessmen and workers fled Iraq after Saddam Hussein 
decided to set them free rather than detain them as a shield against attack. 
Now, individual companies, regardless of their home country's stand on the gulf 
crisis, are finding ways of signaling a willingness to return. 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen are phoning government contacts to discuss how to resume operations 
and negotiate the terms of possible penalties they might incur for late work, 
diplomats say. Some have left a skeleton staff of local employees to staff 
their offices rather than close. 
</P>
<P>
"These are signs of good faith," said a Western diplomat. "Some companies spent 
20 years trying to build a working relationship here. They don't want to throw 
it away in a couple months."

IRAQ LAUNCHES 3RD MISSILE -- BUT NOT AT ALLIED FORCES; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: TROOPS RUSH TO BATTLE STATIONS AS SOVIET-MADE SCUD-B IS TEST-FIRED. 
KEY TARGETS ARE WITHIN ITS RANGE.

<P>
Iraq launched a ballistic missile Friday for the second time in two days, 
sending U.S. troops to their battle stations in preparation for war. The flight 
path, however, did not threaten allied forces, and the alert was canceled 90 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said the test-firing of a Soviet-made Scud-B missile was the third 
such launching this month. The missile was aimed away from U.S. and allied 
troops deployed in Saudi Arabia, officials said, and its flight path was 
entirely within Iraq's borders. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, American troops, who have been in a state of heightened alert since 
before Christmas, have treated each missile launching as though it were the 
first shot of an all-out war. 
</P>
<P>
Here aboard the hospital ship Mercy, a 1,000-bed vessel anchored in the Persian 
Gulf, word of the firing was flashed from U.S. communications personnel in 
Bahrain to the bridge in a classified message. 
</P>
<P>
The mate on watch passed it within seconds to the wardroom, where the master of 
the civilian-crewed ship, Dan O'Brien of Reno, and the commanding officer of 
the medical contingent, Navy Capt. Paul Barry of Buffalo, N.Y., were meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Bells blasted through the corridors of the 900-foot-long vessel, and O'Brien 
told the sailors and merchant marines over the public address system: "A 
missile has been launched. This is not a drill. All personnel take your 
emergency stations. I say again, this is not a drill. Attention on board. A 
Scud missile has been launched." 
</P>
<P>
Sailors in firefighting suits trotted to their positions in the unlikely event 
that the Mercy -- a converted tanker that once carried oil from the Mideast to 
the West under the name of the SS Worth -- was the target. A group of 
journalists were issued gas masks. The flight deck was closed to non-emergency 
personnel. O'Brien ordered the ship's engines warmed up in case it was 
necessary to slip anchor. 
</P>
<P>
The Scud-B, with a range of 220 miles, is one of four types of missiles in 
Iraq's arsenal. The others are short-range, Soviet-made Frogs and the 
Iraqi-produced Al Hussein and Al Abbas. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence officers have reported that Iraq's fixed missile launchers 
are stationed west of Baghdad, but the country also has a number of mobile 
launchers dispersed throughout Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi cities and allied troop concentrations are within range of the missiles. 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said that if the United States initiates 
hostilities, his first target will be Tel Aviv, Israel's largest city. 
</P>
<P>
Together with 2,700 artillery pieces -- traditionally the most effective 
weapons against advancing troops -- and 4,000 tanks, the estimated 200 missiles 
in Iraq's arsenal would represent a formidable challenge to allied forces in 
the event of war. Iraq also has a network of heavily manned defensive 
fortifications rimmed by mine fields and other obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
If war breaks out, U.S. commanders believe Iraq is likely to rely on the same 
tactics it used during its eight-year war with Iran: Attacking forces would be 
allowed to punch their way through sections of the defensive lines, but then 
would find themselves in "killing zones" where Iraq has massed artillery, 
mortars, rocket launchers and tanks buried up to their turrets. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Iranians died in these zones, many of them young boys who 
wore wooden keys to heaven around their necks. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to prevent U.S. surveillance planes from pinpointing missile and 
weapons sites, Iraq has turned off some of the radar devices that guide its 
military systems, intelligence officers said. It also has virtually eliminated 
test-firing of its artillery.

<P>
Lloyd's shipping agency said it had received a navigation warning from 
Washington dated Dec. 27 which "advises mariners to exercise extreme caution in 
the vicinity of the Az Zuluf oil field due to the probable presence of mines."

Iraqi opposition groups said Friday that they had joined forces to topple

VIETNAMESE IN U.S. VISITING HOMELAND IN GROWING NUMBERS; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRANTS: THEY NEED TO SEE FRIENDS AND RELATIVES OR TO COME TO TERMS WITH 
THEIR PAST. HANOI HAS MADE TRAVEL EASIER.

After many years of exile from their homeland, Vietnamese-Americans 
increasingly are returning to Vietnam for visits, according to officials of 
refugee assistance programs and the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
The trips often are arranged by travel agents, who route people through third 
countries, including Thailand, Canada, Hong Kong and Japan, the officials say, 
citing the U.S. economic embargo against Vietnam and the lack of diplomatic 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Travel has increased because the Vietnam government has made it easier, because 
many Vietnamese-Americans believe U.S.-Vietnam relations are improving and 
because of the simple human need to see aging relatives, friends and loved ones 
left behind. 
</P>
<P>
"People are just thronging back to Vietnam, believing they will be safe to 
return to visit relatives," said a U.S. government official. The change is 
dramatic, said the official, noting that, in previous years, "you could count 
the number on a few fingers." 
</P>
<P>
"It is very important to go home and say goodby," said Kim Cook, program 
director of the Vietnamese Resettlement Assn., which serves many of the 
estimated 30,000 Vietnamese-Americans in northern Virginia. "Many also go back 
to try to make sense of their escape" after South Vietnam fell to the 
communists in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said: "The Vietnamese community sees Americans shaking hands with the 
communists. We can't keep the grudges forever." 
</P>
<P>
For Vietnamese who fled communism for the United States, a return to Vietnam 
represents coming to terms with their past. It represents also a coming of age 
for yet another immigrant population in America -- one that, like the Irish, 
the Germans, Italians and others before it, has stayed away long enough to make 
returning bearable. 
</P>
<P>
And, by all accounts, the returns are numerous, from all over the country. 
Although no one can say exactly how many people go back for visits, one U.S. 
official estimated "at least 10,000 a year." 
</P>
<P>
In Biloxi, Miss., Loan Vu, director of a refugee program at Catholic Social 
Services, said: "A lot of people are going from here. It's the common thing 
now, if you've got the money." 
</P>
<P>
According to people familiar with the travel costs, a visa typically costs $100 
to $150, and a round-trip flight costs $1,100 to $1,400. Several said flights 
are heavily booked all the way through February because many people are 
returning for the Vietnamese New Year holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, Calif., Nhi Ho, executive director of the Orange County Refugee 
Community Resource Opportunity Project, said he first went back two years ago, 
when he was an aide to Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) and found it 
"nice to be back." He went on to say that "the Vietnamese government tries to 
get more money from tourists, so they make it easy" for travelers. 
</P>
<P>
The travel has caused strains among Vietnamese immigrants, many of whom are 
staunchly anti-communist and still believe Vietnamese-Americans should not 
return, even for visits. 
</P>
<P>
Tuong Nguyen, executive director of the Vietnamese Community of Orange County 
Inc., said that, although he sympathizes with people's emotional needs to 
visit, "I don't think they should go back until the political situation 
changes," because most departed as refugees who had a "well-founded fear" of 
persecution for their political beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
There are signs that change is coming. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has been helping in the effort to reach a peace agreement in Cambodia. 
It has also helped the United States account for Americans missing in action 
and has agreed to allow other countries to resettle 10,000 political prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe those moves signal broad improvement in relations and 
that the economic embargo against Vietnam could be lifted soon. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech in Washington, Richard Solomon, assistant secretary of state 
for East Asia and Pacific affairs, said: "We look forward to a new era in 
Indochina and for U.S. relations with Vietnam, with Cambodia and with Laos. 
Such a new era is only months away, we hope." 
</P>
<P>
The pace of normalization, Solomon said, depends largely on the pace of Vietnam 
cooperation on resolving the fate of the 2,300 missing Americans and on 
stabilizing Cambodia. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. businessmen, seeing their competitors in the rest of the world beating a 
path to Vietnam, are eagerly seeking some of the action but cannot legally 
invest in Vietnam as long as the embargo is in effect. As Vietnamese-Americans' 
businesses mature, they too become part of the group wanting to do business 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Le Xuan Khoa, president of the Indochina Resource Action Center in the nation's 
capital, said: "Many people want to go back to explore future possible 
activities, such as business and technical assistance." Others, he said, want 
to offer humanitarian assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. officials have indicated that a thaw in relations may be coming, 
many Vietnamese worry that such diplomatic efforts could be shoved into the 
background by the standoff in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many are not waiting for normalization before they visit Vietnam, 
and travel agents are cashing in. 
</P>
<P>
In Arlington, travel agencies advertise in Vietnamese newspapers, as does 
Vietnam Express. Calvin Pham, a partner in the business, said about 30 people a 
month get Vietnam visas through his agency. 
</P>
<P>
Although the practice is not illegal, agencies sometimes do have to confront 
U.S. law enforcement officials. Pham said FBI agents recently visited his firm 
to make sure nothing that violated national security was going on. 
</P>
<P>
As for the clients, Pham said: "They have a good time. They can't wait to get 
back" to the low prices and high living, as well as fun with family members. 
</P>
<P>
The majority who visit already have become American citizens, officials said. 
Those who have not yet completed naturalization worry that their visits will 
hamper their effort to gain U.S. citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, and because the visits still are controversial among 
Vietnamese, many are reluctant to discuss their travels, spokesmen for refugee 
assistance groups said. "You could be accused of being a communist," said one 
official. 
</P>
<P>
Some travelers who do talk about their visits report surprise at how much their 
country has changed. Street names, for example, are not the same in old 
neighborhoods -- changed by the communists in the same way that Saigon became 
Ho Chi Minh City. Others say they are immediately recognized as U.S. residents, 
standing out because of their western clothing, even their way of walking. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Cook said returnees report two strong emotions. One, "You are a star and so 
well-treated," she said. The other, "You are so struck with the poverty of your 
own people." 
</P>
<P>
And, she added: "Nobody goes over (returns to Vietnam) to stay."

'CHEATING' DRUG DEALER GETS LIGHTER SENTENCE 
</P>

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A convicted cocaine dealer apparently cheated undercover police officers in a 
drug deal, and ended up with a lighter prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Leon of Grand Rapids would have faced a mandatory 20 years in prison if 
he had sold eight ounces of cocaine to the policemen. But the officers later 
discovered they had bought only 7.8 ounces. Leon, 28, was sentenced Thursday to 
13 to 20 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"He shorted us," Kent County Assistant Prosecutor Ellwyn Bloemers said. "That's 
not unusual to have that happen to us. When we buy two ounces, it should be 56 
grams, but we come back with 49 frequently. He's very slick; he's very 
polished."

EAST HARD HIT BY FIRST SNOW OF WINTER

<TEXT>
<P>
The first blast of winter hit the East Coast on Friday, knocking out power to 
thousands of residents, disrupting flights and delaying or detouring commuters. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of fender-benders and other accidents were reported as motorists 
adjusted to the snow for the first time this winter, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
At least three deaths in Connecticut were described by authorities as 
weather-related: Two men suffered heart attacks when shoveling snow, and a 
17-year-old died when the car he was traveling in slid off the road and 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
The heaviest snowfall was reported in Pennsylvania, where Bedford received 13 
inches, Altoona had 11 and Somerset 9. 
</P>
<P>
Martinsburg, W. Va., was buried under at least 10 inches of snow, and freezing 
rain turned West Virginia's highways into skating rinks, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Seven inches of wet snow fell in New York City's Central Park, just a few days 
after record high temperatures in the 60s. 
</P>
<P>
Airports in New York City reported delays of 45 minutes to an hour because of 
the weather.

GULF CRISIS FOUND TO BE 1990'S TOP STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crisis in the Persian Gulf was by far the biggest news story of 1990, with 
more than 60% of Americans participating in monthly surveys saying they have 
"closely followed" developments since Iraq invaded Kuwait in early August. 
</P>
<P>
According to a year-end assessment issued Friday, the only domestic development 
that drew similarly close attention was a direct spin-off of the gulf crisis: 
the rise in gasoline prices caused by the invasion's impact on world petroleum 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Each month, the Times Mirror Center for The People &amp; The Press surveys a 
sample of Americans to determine what news stories attracted the most attention 
and what the public learned from them. 
</P>
<P>
In its year-end report, the center said the gulf crisis had generated unusually 
intense and prolonged interest among news consumers. 
</P>
<P>
With one exception, the only news stories that attracted more than 40% interest 
in this year's monthly surveys were those involving the U.S. military buildup 
in the gulf, the hostages held in Iraq and Kuwait and the steep rise in 
gasoline prices at home. 
</P>
<P>
The single exception was the U.S. invasion of Panama, which was closely 
followed by 60% of those who participated in last January's survey. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the peaceful revolution in Eastern Europe and turmoil within the 
Soviet Union attracted relatively little attention. In no month were stories on 
these topics closely followed by 30% of those surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
The intense focus on the gulf conflict appeared to divert attention from news 
closer to home. Besides the gasoline price rise, the top-rated domestic stories 
were the decline of the economy and sensational crimes. 
</P>
<P>
News interest intensified as the U.S. economy began to slip in late summer, 
according to the surveys. By November, 39% of respondents said they were 
closely following economic news. 
</P>
<P>
Only sensational crime stories tended to attract as much attention. The 
September murders of five people near the University of Florida campus 
registered 36% on the "closely followed" index, and 29% of survey participants 
said they focused on the bizarre Boston suicide and murder of Charles Stuart 
and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there was a clear consensus on the most over-covered story of the 
year: the marital troubles of Donald and Ivana Trump. In March, a record 55% of 
those surveyed said they were fed up with news about the Trumps' travails. 
</P>
<P>
The center also tallies how many respondents can correctly identify names in 
the news. The results suggest that even the key figures in the most closely 
followed stories are not well known. Only 17% could correctly identify Gen. 
Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the nation's top 
military leader. However, 37% were able to correctly identify Marla Maples, 
Donald Trump's paramour.

While the state's citrus growers prepared themselves for yet another wave of 
cold weather, California consumers on Friday were getting their first taste of 
higher citrus prices linked to last week's deep freeze. 
</P>
<P>
At Lucky supermarkets in Southern California, the price of a pound of navel 
oranges has skyrocketed to 99 cents a pound from 59 cents. "We are paying 
substantially more for produce and it's having to be reflected in the prices 
that are being charged to customers," said Meredith Anderson, spokeswoman for 
the 411-store chain. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of nearly all produce linked to the freeze "has more than doubled," 
said Jack H. Brown, chairman of the 104-store Stater Bros. supermarket chain, 
where navel oranges rose from 59 cents to 89 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
But consumers will not be complaining about California navel orange prices in 
three weeks because there will probably be none left to buy, said Joel Nelsen, 
president of the California Citrus Mutual, a growers association. "You're not 
going to see California navels by the end of January . . . you usually see them 
through the end of June." 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural inspectors have set up check points at Gorman and other sites to 
prevent truck shipments of damaged fruit from reaching stores, said Nelsen. 
</P>
<P>
In the state's citrus groves, growers were hauling away damaged fruit and 
inspecting trees for signs of serious damage -- like splitting wood -- that may 
prevent the trees from bearing fruit next season or, in the most severe cases, 
require their destruction. "If you have any splitting of the wood, that's not a 
good sign at all," said Bob Krauter, spokesman for California Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Growers were also taking steps to protect the trees from the latest cold wave 
that is sweeping down the state. Although not expected to be as severe as the 
previous cold snap, growers are not taking any chances, said Nelsen. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not any fruit to lose -- the real concern is about the trees," said 
Nelsen. "They are more susceptible to damage from cold temperatures." The trees 
are at risk when temperatures dip below 22 degrees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven counties statewide notified the California Department of Food and 
Agriculture of their intentions to declare emergencies, a spokesman for the 
California Department of Food and Agriculture said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from the counties of Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Fresno, Ventura, 
Tulare, Kern, Madera, Riverside, San Bernardino, Imperial and Glenn had sent 
preliminary notices to the department, said Joe Bandy, regional coordinator for 
the department in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County's director of disaster services declared an emergency Friday 
after an estimated $100 million in citrus and vegetable crop losses from last 
weekend's freeze. 
</P>
<P>
In Fresno County, the state's largest agricultural producer, a disaster 
declaration awaited signatures from county supervisors and was expected to be 
forwarded to Gov. George Deukmejian for his signature. 
</P>
<P>
Fresno citrus growers suffered an estimated $60 million in losses, with damage 
on the $95-million vegetable crops not yet assessed, Deputy Agriculture 
Commissioner Dennis Plann said. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Joanna Miller in Ventura contributed to this story.

RECORD ARRESTS SUGGEST IMMIGRATION TREND SHIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Border Patrol agents here arrested record numbers of undocumented 
immigrants in the late fall and early winter, a trend that points to a shift 
toward more year-round immigration, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have long viewed November and December as a relatively slow 
period for illegal immigration. That period after the agricultural harvests is 
a time when many undocumented foreign-born residents head south to visit 
families left behind in Mexico and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
But border guards in the San Diego area now record almost 1,000 arrests per day 
-- a record pace for December. 
</P>
<P>
The brisk pace comes after San Diego-based agents recorded 33,687 arrests in 
November, an increase of 22% over November, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Officials trace the current winter upswing to a variety of factors, including 
economic problems in Mexico and the increasing tendency of immigrants to 
relocate permanently in the United States -- not just to work for a few months 
and then return home in the classic migratory pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're seeing as much of the so-called 'seasonal' immigration as 
we used to see," said Ted Swofford, supervisory Border Patrol agent in San 
Diego, the busiest site for legal and illegal traffic along the nearly 
2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border. "We're finding that people are coming 12 months 
a year." 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural laborers, whose treks to the United States tend to be seasonal, 
now account for only about 15% of illicit border crossers, a much smaller 
number than a decade ago, according to research at the UC San Diego Center for 
U.S.-Mexican Studies and elsewhere. Immigrants now find work in a wide variety 
of settings, from the fields to factories to construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
Academic researchers on both sides of the border also have found that women and 
children are increasingly making the voyage north, underlining the intention of 
many new immigrants to remain in the United States permanently. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, everyone said they would come to the north for six or eight 
months and then return to Mexico," said Jose Luis Perez Canchola, who heads an 
immigration study center in Tijuana. "But now, the idea is to stay. People see 
no economic alternative in Mexico. The Mexican government has done nothing to 
provide them with alternatives."

COURT RULING ASKED ON LEGALITY OF LUNGREN APPOINTMENT OF STIRLING AS CHIEF 
DEPUTY

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Atty. Gen.-elect Dan Lungren asked the state Court of Appeal on Friday to 
decide whether the man he wants to be his chief deputy can legally serve in 
that office. Earlier this week, John K. Van de Kamp, the current state attorney 
general, argued that Lungren's choice for his top aide -- Sacramento Superior 
Court Judge David Stirling -- could not take the job because the state 
Constitution prevents judges from leaving the bench during their terms to take 
another public office. 
</P>
<P>
Contending that Van de Kamp has misinterpreted the Constitution, Lungren and 
Stirling asked the court to settle the matter so that Stirling can assume his 
new post on Jan. 7 when Lungren takes office. The suit asks the court to direct 
state Controller Gray Davis to ignore the Van de Kamp opinion and begin paying 
Stirling's salary as chief deputy.

The worst thing about TV in 1990 is that it produced no new series that can be 
called truly influential to the future of the medium. 
</P>
<P>
"The Simpsons"? Unique and successful, but one of a kind. It will not change 
the course of TV, except, perhaps, for the inevitable imitations. As someone 
said, imitation is the sincerest form of television. 
</P>
<P>
"Twin Peaks"? You don't make this show twice. 
</P>
<P>
"Cop Rock"? The greatest potential, by far, to influence TV -- if it had 
succeeded. Music would have returned to TV with new dramatic vistas. But the 
show's failure probably killed prime-time musicals for years. 
</P>
<P>
Thus TV, half a century old in America -- a classic case of middle-age burnout. 
</P>
<P>
It's one thing to be a hit show on TV, quite another to influence its course. 
"Columbo" was brilliant but changed little or nothing on the tube. 
</P>
<P>
Several years back, we were asked by a TV show to list what we thought were the 
10 most influential series of all time. That is, of course, impossible, because 
there are more than 10. 
</P>
<P>
But here's what we listed, in no particular order: 
</P>
<P>
* "Today." Its influence on morning television speaks for itself. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Tonight Show." Its influence on late-night television speaks for itself. 
</P>
<P>
* "60 Minutes." The quintessential TV news magazine that inspired countless 
others. 
</P>
<P>
* "All in the Family." The most significant sitcom ever in terms of opening the 
door to subjects once taboo on TV. 
</P>
<P>
* "Playhouse 90." It set a standard for TV quality. 
</P>
<P>
* The nightly news (on all three networks). A habit for millions, the greatest 
source of current events for many Americans and a format that is the backbone 
of virtually every TV station. 
</P>
<P>
* "Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In." A zany and topical breakthrough, its social 
impact was vast as it cheerfully ignored TV's no-no's with an incomparable 
cast. 
</P>
<P>
* "Cagney &amp; Lacey." TV's first feminist drama. A new attitude for a new 
era. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Ernie Kovacs Show." It showed what was possible, and television comedy 
is still stealing from it. 
</P>
<P>
"Real People." The granddaddy of TV infotainment. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, one can disagree with this list, or add other influential shows to it. 
</P>
<P>
"I Love Lucy" set up decades of other sitcoms. "Mary Tyler Moore" and "MASH" 
carried weekly comedy to a bracing level of adult wit. 
</P>
<P>
"Late Night With David Letterman" brought a new, intimate relationship with TV 
to a generation raised on it. "thirtysomething" dramatically probed the 
thoughts and feelings of that same generation. 
</P>
<P>
"Roots" opened the floodgates to miniseries. "Miami Vice" injected the vast 
influence of pop music into the television mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
But what of this year? 
</P>
<P>
It's no small thing that "Life Goes On," which debuted in 1989 and features an 
actor with Down's syndrome, is having an impact in breaking TV ground for 
people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
And it's no small thing that a black-oriented satirical comedy series, "In 
Living Color," erratic though it may be, is taking TV in new directions. 
</P>
<P>
But there is very little else currently on the networks that can be regarded as 
genuinely influential -- an arrow to TV's future directions. Even the best 
shows -- "Cheers," for instance -- don't necessarily qualify. 
</P>
<P>
"Cheers," a soul mate to the old "Barney Miller" series, is nothing but 
excellent. Yet "Married . . . With Children" may be more influential in 
pointing up TV's angry, even nasty, new edginess toward traditional values. 
</P>
<P>
With the networks stagnating, where were TV's truly influential forces in 1990? 
</P>
<P>
On cable. For in the new, specialized and revolutionary world of alternative 
TV, many viewers have taken to watching channels more devotedly than they watch 
individual shows. Cable is the equivalent of a magazine rack, and there seems 
to be something for everyone -- a clue to what we can expect more of from TV in 
coming years. 
</P>
<P>
If MTV is the most blazing example and is aimed at the young generation, well, 
then, we now have choices for folks a little older -- the Nostalgia Channel, 
for instance, and American Movie Classics and TNT, which feature vintage films. 
</P>
<P>
The nice thing about such channels is the subtly influential appeal to all age 
groups to cross over and sample what the other generation is watching, which is 
a fine and natural way to foster understanding of past and present. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna and John Wayne are only a zap apart in this new TV world, with its 
ultimately healthy bonding of who we were and what we are. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows about the influence of such cable news channels as CNN and 
C-SPAN, the sports outlet ESPN, and the cultural networks Bravo and Arts &amp; 
Entertainment. But viewers are also being lured and hooked by the growing and 
often fascinating trend of personal-service cable channels. 
</P>
<P>
It is nice to know that when the Big Three networks are offering another 
plastic-wrapped episode of another plastic-wrapped series, you can flip over to 
the Travel Channel and find out about the latest hot spots and prices, or to 
the Weather Channel and learn how things are in London, Bangkok or Lincoln, 
Neb. 
</P>
<P>
Once primitive services, these channels are clearly offering more varied 
programming, and it is still, for the most part, refreshingly unslick. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the personal-service cable channels -- like the home shopping outlets 
-- are easy targets for ridicule, and yet, watching them, it is easy to see why 
they are irresistible to many viewers. The influence here is television's 
long-promised interactive relationship with those watching. For this inveterate 
browser, the most stylish home shopping channel is J.C. Penney's. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not ashamed. I like raw TV -- that is to say, programs with as little 
window dressing as possible. 
</P>
<P>
I can't say I'm crazy about all the new infomercials -- those often-lunatic, 
program-length ads that may, for instance, show audiences applauding a cleaning 
fluid as it gets the spot out of a shirt. There are moments when one begins to 
have serious doubts about democracy. 
</P>
<P>
It is significant that infomercials seem to be in an explosive period of 
growth. Freak shows they may often be. "Playhouse 90" they are not. But what 
became increasingly clear in 1990 is that future influences on TV will come 
less from the networks and more from a rowdy competitive arena that, with all 
its faults, is excitingly dangerous and much more intimate with viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Television is being re-invented.

FACES . . .: A BREAK FROM A CAREER AS A PSYCHO: A 'NORMAL' ROLE FOR BRAD DOURIF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since his Oscar-nominated turn as mental patient Billy in 1975's "One Flew Over 
the Cuckoo's Nest," Brad Dourif has made a career playing offbeat characters. 
</P>
<P>
He was a psycho anarchist in "Ragtime," a psycho bigot in "Mississippi 
Burning," and a psycho inhabited by the devil in "The Exorcist III." He also 
was the voice of the psycho doll Chucky in "Child's Play" and "Child's Play 2." 
</P>
<P>
Dourif finally gets to play a regular guy in "Hidden Agenda," the acclaimed 
political thriller set in Belfast, Northern Ireland. "It was nice to be chosen 
to do that -- play someone normal. For some reason they wanted me." 
</P>
<P>
Dourif portrays American attorney Paul Sullivan, a member of the International 
League for Civil Liberties, who is murdered when he meets a man who has 
damaging evidence against the British. 
</P>
<P>
"We shot for three days in Northern Ireland," he says. "I was impressed by a 
lot of things there." 
</P>
<P>
Especially the graffiti art. "It is the the most impressive I have ever seen," 
Dourif says. "Murals cover both sides of buildings. Some had writing on them. 
It was pretty esoteric." 
</P>
<P>
"Hidden Agenda" marks the fourth film in which Dourif has appeared this year. 
"They (movies) come in spurts," he says. "There was a point I was doing three 
movies at the same time. It was pretty intense." 
</P>
<P>
Dourif doesn't think "Hidden Agenda" will change his image: "Sooner or later, I 
will do something that somebody will take a chance on me. You have to teach the 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
Now 40, Dourif says that he wasn't ready for the success of "Cuckoo's Nest": 
"It certainly changed my career and my life enormously. But I wasn't prepared. 
It scared me a lot. I didn't have a good time. I didn't know how to handle it. 
Some people are really equipped to be successful and some are not. Now, I would 
be delighted." SUSAN KING

SPORTS ON WEEKEND TV

<TEXT>
<P>
The final weekend of the National Football League's regular season will share 
the sports television spotlight with three college bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders could clinch their first AFC West Division title since 1985 today 
if the Kansas City Chiefs lose to the Chicago Bears, 9:30 a.m., Channels 4, 36 
and 39. Today's other NFL game matches the Philadelphia Eagles and Phoenix 
Cardinals, 1 p.m., Channels 2 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
For most Southland viewers, Sunday's best game will come last, when the 
Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Oilers figure to decide the AFC Central 
Division championship at 5 p.m. on ESPN. The Buffalo Bills, already assured of 
home field advantage throughout the playoffs, meet the Washington Redskins at 
10 a.m. on Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
In a game without meaning, the Denver Broncos and Green Bay Packers close out 
mutually disappointing seasons at 1 p.m. on Channels 2 and 8. KNSD Channel 39 
in San Diego and KMIR Channel 36 in Palm Springs will carry the Raiders-San 
Diego Chargers game from the Coliseum at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
College Football: Although there will be 16 college bowl games in a six-day 
period, today's Sea World Holiday Bowl between Brigham Young and Texas A&amp;M 
does figure to stand out, mainly because of the Cougars passing attack led by 
Heisman Trophy quarterback Ty Detmer. ESPN's coverage begins at 4:30 p.m. 
Today's other bowl games are the Peach, matching Indiana and Auburn (9:30 a.m., 
Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42) and the Freedom from Anaheim Stadium between Oregon 
and Colorado State (5 p.m., Channels 9, 51 and 63.) 
</P>
<P>
Basketball and hockey: Fans wanting alternatives to football today can turn to 
the Clippers and Utah Jazz (12:30 p.m., Channel 5); the Kings and Montreal 
Canadiens (7:30 p.m., Prime Ticket); Nevada Las Vegas and Pacific basketball (8 
p.m., SportsChannel) or UCLA-San Diego State basketball (11:30 p.m., Prime 
Ticket.). On Sunday, the Lakers are home against the 76ers for a 7:30 p.m. 
Prime Ticket telecast.STEVEN HERBERT

COMPUTAINMENT: DELUXE SCRABBLE SCORES WITH NONTRADITIONALISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANE deCOSTER and DAVID CROOK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Virgin Mastertronics' "The Deluxe Computer Edition of Scrabble" trades away 
much of the familiar appeal of the classic board game for some intriguing bells 
and whistles. Serious players looking to exercise their skills and stretch 
their vocabularies probably will embrace the new features. 
</P>
<P>
But traditionalists will long for the competition, surprise and camaraderie 
possible only between human players. 
</P>
<P>
In its most basic form, this computer version of Scrabble -- actually a totally 
redesigned update of an earlier electronic version of the game -- closely 
resembles the actual board game. After fellow players -- human or computer -- 
and difficultly levels are chosen, random letters are assigned to each player. 
</P>
<P>
Words are formed and placed on the board in the same way you would with actual 
tiles. A very welcome calculating feature keeps track of the point values for 
all levels of scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, however, the computer version doesn't do a very good job of 
hiding tiles. Whether playing the computer or another human, it is all but 
impossible not to know what your opponent has in his/her/its rack. Using the 
hide feature doesn't help much either. 
</P>
<P>
We also found a lot to be desired with the huge (2.5 megabytes) dictionary 
program that comes with the game: golfer and offer for two. The game makers 
promised the entire "Official Scrabble Player's Dictionary," but our trusty 
1979 paperback edition turned out to be a bit more complete than the 1990 
electronic one. 
</P>
<P>
"Deluxe Computer Scrabble" has enough pluses to make it as a good solitaire 
game, but it is definitely not a substitute for an evening with the original 
board game and a couple of good friends.

MULTI-FAMILY HOME FUTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of permits issued during October for multiple-family housing was 
about the same as in September, leaving half of the home-building futures 
quotient running ahead of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
While the year-to-date number of permits for single-family homes has sunk to 
around half last year's total, the 10-month total for multi-family housing is 
8% ahead (October figures are the most recent ones available). The 1990 level 
continues far in arrears of 1986-88, however. 
</P>
<P>
The cities of Tustin, Irvine and Orange as well as the county's unincorporated 
areas are the centers of this future activity, while building in Anaheim, 
Mission Viejo and Fullerton has cooled considerably since last year. Five 
cities have issued no such permits during the first 10 months of either of the 
past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how the cities stack up, listed from the largest increase to the largest 
decrease in multiple-family housing permits issued:

The Organization of American States, meeting in Washington, deplored the 
military coup in Suriname and called for restoration of democracy in the former 
Dutch colony in South America. In Paramaribo, Suriname's capital, politicians 
and army leaders held frantic talks to find a successor to President Ramsewak 
Shankar, who resigned after this week's bloodless coup. Military leaders 
promised that elections will be held within 100 days.

Nearly 600 Albanians have braved machine-gun fire and waded through heavy snow 
and icy waters so far this month to flee to Greece, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The refugees, mostly ethnic Greeks from southern Albania, are fleeing the 
Communist country that was long Eastern Europe's most repressed and isolated 
state but which is due to hold multi-party elections in February. Refugees tell 
of long hikes through heavy snow and of Albanian border guards opening up with 
machine guns even after they crossed the border. Five or six people have been 
killed and many wounded by guards in recent days, refugees said.

Public Security Minister Wang Fang was replaced by a deputy, Tao Siju. Zheng

REFORMS IN MINORITY CONTRACTING DEMANDED; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: RTD PRESIDENT ORDERS DRAFTING OF CHANGES AFTER DISCLOSURES IN THE 
TIMES OF ABUSES IN CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The chief of minority contracting for the Southern California Rapid Transit 
District was ordered Friday to recommend reforms in a federally mandated 
program intended to steer transit construction work to disadvantaged 
businesses, and to explain why the program has not been more aggressively 
monitored by the RTD. 
</P>
<P>
RTD President Nikolas Patsaouras ordered Walter Norwood, head of the district's 
office of economic opportunity, to prepare recommendations for reform 
legislation in the wake of disclosures in The Times detailing abuses in the 
program, which is supposed to help struggling firms operated by women and 
members of racial and ethnic minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked Norwood, by the end of next week, to frame a legislative agenda and 
also to address any issues (in the Times series) that were critical of the 
RTD," Patsaouras said, adding he expects direct responses. "I don't want smoke 
and mirrors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Patsaouras said the report would be presented to the RTD board next month. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' series reported that tens of millions of dollars meant for 
businesses owned by minorities and women have been going to firms that do not 
appear to be disadvantaged or allegedly have acted as fronts for non-minority 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
The RTD and the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission have been in 
charge of constructing the $7.5-billion transit system that is slated for 
completion by the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
Patsaouras said he has also asked the commission to help draft reform 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
The Times found that loopholes in federal regulations appear to allow companies 
that are not owned by disadvantaged individuals to receive lucrative minority 
subcontracts. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an undisputed fact that minorities need a break -- but the rules under 
which public agencies such as the RTD and (the transportation commission) 
operate are flawed," Patsaouras said in a prepared statement released by RTD 
officials. "We commend The Times for shining a spotlight on those areas. We 
hope those with the power to make changes in Sacramento and Washington, D.C., 
will do so." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to loopholes in regulations, The Times found that the program was 
not working properly because the RTD and the transportation commission failed 
to communicate with each other, were slow to enforce rules, were sometimes 
unaware of important federal regulations and interpreted regulations 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, for example, requires a minority contractor applicant to 
possess a state contractor's license before being certified for the program, 
but the RTD does not. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nonsense," Patsaouras said of the district's failure to require such a 
license. He also said that RTD officials should be more aggressive and use 
common sense in monitoring the program. 
</P>
<P>
"If the staff says the law is ambiguous," he said, "I would rather they do what 
they thought was right and let the aggrieved party sue us. . . . If in (their) 
opinion, the (applicant) is not a legitimate minority, let's test it . . . and 
let him challenge it. . . . At least we'll make a statement rather than hiding 
behind federal rules." 
</P>
<P>
Patsaouras said he has long believed minority certification for work on the 
transit project should be handled by only one agency to prevent duplication and 
inconsistency.

POLITICS: CANDIDATES ARE FREE TO RAISE UNLIMITED AMOUNTS. JUDGE CITES A FEDERAL

Changing the fund-raising rules 3 1/2 weeks before the Jan. 22 election, a 
Superior Court judge Friday lifted campaign contribution limits for Los Angeles 
County's 1st Supervisorial District race, sending candidates scurrying to tap 
their supporters for bigger donations. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling by Judge John Zebrowski came in response to a suit brought by the 
county's biggest labor union, Service Employees International Union, which is 
backing Democratic state Sen. Art Torres. The union has pledged to pour a 
minimum of $50,000 into the race to end a decade of conservative control of the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
The decision also lifted a ban on transfers from one candidate to another, 
allowing conservative Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana to funnel 
money from their sizable campaign treasuries to Sarah Flores, the only 
prominent Republican in the race. Democratic politicians also can now give 
unlimited amounts to the Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Zebrowski cited a federal court ruling in September that struck down 
contribution caps imposed by Proposition 73 as an abridgment of freedom of 
expression. The 1988 voter-approved measure, which limited donations to $1,000 
from an individual and $5,000 from a political action committee, was designed 
to lessen the influence of special interests. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates are now free to raise unlimited amounts. 
</P>
<P>
"The floodgates are open," state Sen. Charles M. Calderon said. 
</P>
<P>
None of the four major candidates was willing to voluntarily adhere to the 
Proposition 73 limits. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in unilateral disarmament," Calderon said. He predicted that 
candidates will each spend $500,000 or more to "inundate, if not bury, the poor 
voter with mail, telephone messages, perhaps radio, and paid walkers." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilwoman Gloria Molina said the ruling gives special 
interests a greater opportunity to influence the election. "We are going to 
have to raise larger amounts of money in order to be competitive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, when informed of the ruling, said: "That's great. . . . I'm going to 
ask for as much as I possibly can." 
</P>
<P>
Calderon and Flores, a former aide to retiring Supervisor Pete Schabarum, said 
the ruling would benefit Torres the most. 
</P>
<P>
Torres was unavailable. But his spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers, said, "I don't 
think there is any doubt we will be able to raise more money," but she could 
not say how much. 
</P>
<P>
Myers contended that all of the candidates would benefit. With the slumping 
economy, the holiday season and contributors tapped out from the November 
statewide election, "it's a tough time to be out raising money," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She contended that Flores could benefit the most. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of business interests who have business before the county who 
want to make sure a Republican gets elected and the board philosophy doesn't 
change," Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
Dana said he would consider funneling money from his $700,000 campaign fund to 
Flores, but no decision has been made. Antonovich could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Robertson, executive secretary-treasurer of the County Federation of 
Labor, AFL-CIO, applauded the ruling. "It is going to increase our ability to 
make contributions to our candidate, which is Art Torres." Robertson could not 
specify an amount. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest reports covering fund raising through Dec. 8, Molina raised 
$108,260; Torres, $53,578; Flores, $28,318; and Calderon, $10,300. 
</P>
<P>
The state Fair Political Practices Commission advised candidates last month 
that the limits applied to the 1st District race because it is a special 
election. But the commission did not send an attorney to Friday's court 
hearing, sending a letter instead agreeing to abide by the court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"No one is really opposing this," Zebrowski noted. A union attorney argued that 
the Jan. 22 election was not a special election because the seat has not been 
vacated by Schabarum. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Stern, co-director of the California Commission on Campaign Financing, 
said Zebrowski's decision allows "retiring or sitting officeholders -- Democrat 
or Republican -- to once again play power broker in the district." 
</P>
<P>
The Jan. 22 election in a redrawn 1st District was ordered by U.S. District 
Judge David V. Kenyon, who ruled that the old district lines denied the 
county's 3 million Latinos political representation on the county board.

FULL FORCE OF NEW ARCTIC BLAST WILL MISS SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Another mass of arctic air advanced on Southern California Friday, fast on the 
heels of a cold wave that dropped temperatures to historic lows and caused 
untold millions of dollars in damage to the state's citrus and vegetable crops 
during the last week. 
</P>
<P>
But meteorologist Steve Burback of WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts 
for The Times, predicted that the effects of the new front will be less severe 
because it will sideswipe the Southland. Nonetheless, it will lower 
temperatures and bring strong winds. 
</P>
<P>
"It will move out of the area quickly," Burback said. "It should pass through 
the area by Saturday night, with some showers possible along the coast from 
Orange County to the San Diego area." 
</P>
<P>
Daytime highs are expected to warm into the 60s by New Year's Day after 
overnight lows in the 30s bedevil hundreds of "campers" staked out at curbside 
spots to watch the Rose Parade along Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Before the weather warms, however, Southern Californians from the desert to the 
sea can expect northeast winds, gusting from 15 m.p.h. to 35 m.p.h. today and 
into Sunday, Burback said. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Reo of the National Weather Service said that the fast-moving cold front 
is expected to damage more crops in inland areas as overnight lows drop into 
the low 20s. She advised residents to continue to protect animals and 
cold-sensitive plants. 
</P>
<P>
California's deep freeze already was affecting prices in stores, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The prices of navel oranges has already doubled on the wholesale market, and 
it could triple," said Robert Krauter, a spokesman for the California Farm 
Bureau. "With the severity of damage, prices have been fairly quick to react." 
</P>
<P>
State officials have not issued an official estimate of damage caused by the 
freeze. But some experts have predicted that the total may run as high as $1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still anyone's guess how bad it could get," Krauter told the Associated 
Press. "A lot depends on what growers find in the next 10 to 14 days, since 
some of the damage may not show up for that long." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Rose Parade float builders were scrambling to replace thousands 
of flowers hit by the freeze. 
</P>
<P>
At Cal Poly Pomona, Cory Siedel, co-chairman of the float committee, issued an 
appeal Friday for replacement blooms to complete "Tickle Attack," a scene 
featuring a tiger being tickled by a band of monkeys. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get hold of orange flowers wherever we can find them," Siedel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature rose to a high of 62 Friday at the Civic Center, five degrees 
below normal for the date. The relative humidity ranged between 24% and 46%, 
according to the National Weather Service.

ARMORY SHELTER PLANS CALLED COLD COMFORT; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESSNESS: CRITICS SAY GUIDELINES NEEDLESSLY LOCK OUT THE NEEDY. ORANGE 
COUNTY'S POLICY HAS COME IN FOR SPECIAL CRITICISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
California's armory shelter program, once hailed as an innovative response to 
the plight of the needy, is coming under increasing criticism this winter for 
employing guidelines that leave thousands of homeless needlessly out in the 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Orange County has come in for special criticism from some local 
homeless advocates who say it has failed to follow the lead of other counties 
that have aggressively pursued armories as a cold weather option. 
</P>
<P>
Critics charge that Orange County has made its National Guard armories 
available to the homeless far less often than other areas, in part because 
officials rely on a strict interpretation of state guidelines and make no 
direct financial contribution to the program. 
</P>
<P>
"The armories in Orange County were open 14 nights last winter while those in 
the San Fernando Valley were open an average of 50 nights the last three years; 
there are a number of areas in which Orange County lags behind other 
communities," said Jere Witter, a spokesman for the Legal Aid Society of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County armories were not scheduled to open Friday night, but are 
expected to open tonight and Sunday, when forecasters predict the county will 
feel another blast of Arctic air. 
</P>
<P>
Homeless advocates are willing to admit that having the armory program is 
better than having no statewide winter shelter plan. But they argue that 
because of restrictive guidelines it has not lived up to its potential as a 
shield against harsh weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
There is also concern that resources for the program vary widely. Some counties 
provide significant funding, others do not. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, many homeless advocates fear local support may be the greatest barrier 
to wider use: The more days the armories are open, the greater the costs of 
running the program. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan approved by Gov. George Deukmejian in 1987, armories can open 
when the temperature is forecast by the National Weather Service to drop to 40 
degrees or below, or 50 degrees or below with a 50% chance of rain. 
</P>
<P>
But many homeless advocates say the criteria are arbitrary and expose the 
homeless to life-threatening conditions. They argue that the armory program 
should be seasonal rather than temperature-driven, contending there is little 
difference between 39 degrees and 45 degrees for a person forced to bed down on 
bone-chilling concrete. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed medical experts say hypothermia, a condition related to subnormal body 
temperature, can occur in even mild weather. 
</P>
<P>
More important than temperature is duration of exposure, exacerbated by such 
factors as drug or alcohol consumption, disease and malnourishment -- 
conditions likely to beset many homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely variable as to what conditions are life threatening, but it's 
not uncommon to have hypothermia when temperatures are in the 50s," said Dr. 
Sandy Gordon, an assistant clinical professor of emergency medicine at UCI 
Medical Center in Orange. "And it doesn't take very long -- minutes to hours. 
You don't have to be out in the cold for two days." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County homeless advocates, with others statewide, are mounting an effort 
to get the standards eased. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to ask that they be made available to the fullest extent possible 
when not in use by the National Guard," said Kay Knepprath, program manager for 
the California Homeless and Housing Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Bev Passorello, who coordinates the armory program for the state Office of 
Emergency Services, said the program has experienced some problems but has 
generally been successful. So far this winter, armories statewide have logged 
more than 27,000 shelter nights, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am sympathetic to their concerns, but I also think the armories should be a 
last resort," said Passorello. "They are great for temporary overflow, but they 
are not a long-term solution." 
</P>
<P>
Although the guidelines for use of National Guard armories apply statewide, 
many communities have used wide latitude in interpreting them. The result is a 
patchwork of programs up and down the state. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the guidelines state that use of armories can be based on five- or 
seven-day weather forecasts. Many communities use the provision to keep 
armories open the entire week if even only one day meets the temperature 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
"We opened our armories on Thanksgiving and project that they will be open 
continually until March 31," said James McAteer, director of the Santa Clara 
County Human Relations Commission, which oversees that county's armory program. 
</P>
<P>
However, in other areas, including Orange County, the forecast is checked each 
day to determine if the armory will open that night. Officials must make a 
decision to open by 10 a.m. and in order to complete dozens of procedures to 
insure that volunteers, food, blankets, security and other arrangements are 
lined up. 
</P>
<P>
Critics claim that system is highly inefficient, more costly and also confusing 
for homeless clientele who never know from day to day if shelters will be 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's armory coordinator, Dianne Edwards, said the local program is 
being used as effectively as state law allows, but she conceded that some 
counties may operate differently. 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to comment on what other areas are doing but our program is 
based on our interpretation of the state guidelines," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Local homeless advocates who work closely with county officials in coordinating 
the local armory program also defend it as an emergency measure that was not 
intended to be a final solution to the problems of homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
They also argue that other communities may benefit from greater funding 
resources, thus allowing greater use of armories. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County provides no direct funding of the armory program, relying instead 
on volunteers, federal homeless- and emergency-assistance funds and a trust 
fund set up for the program. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Santa Clara County provided $250,000 for its armory program, San 
Mateo County provided $25,000 and San Diego County $35,000 this year. "We don't 
have the resources to provide services all the time," said Susan Oakson, a 
coordinator with the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
But Witter, a community education specialist for Legal Aid, and others complain 
that county officials simply have not been as aggressive as they could be and 
that the homeless are suffering because of it. 
</P>
<P>
They point to Los Angeles, where city officials this winter lobbied the state 
to keep armories open for 60 continuous nights, regardless of the weather. When 
state officials disapproved, the city ultimately discontinued use of the 
armories in favor of an expanded winter shelter program using other shelters. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles' mistake may have been in asking for permission. Officials in 
several counties said they simply decided to keep armories open continuously 
during the winter months on the grounds that the space was being wasted when 
not being used by the guard. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor said the armories could be open from December through March so we 
are going to give people in the county a place to go" during that time, said 
Bill Petitt, a manager for the San Mateo County armory program. "The only time 
they close is when the guard is active." 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento County officials said they also ran the armory program continuously 
from October through March during the first year they were made available. The 
winter shelter program is now housed in larger quarters at a 4-H building on 
the California Exposition fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
"From a practical point of view I think it's reasonable to run the program in a 
way that keeps people in a decent situation rather than leaving them out in 
conditions where they end up in the hospital," said Santa Clara County's 
McAteer. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, county officials have also put a local stamp on the program, but 
one that homeless activists are fighting to have changed. Officials there 
decided that temperatures must dip to 35 degrees or 40 degrees with a forecast 
of a half-inch of rain. The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to consider 
bringing the standards more in line with those of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the stricter guidelines, however, San Diego armories opened more 
often than Orange County's -- with the El Cajon armory open 54 nights last year 
and the Vista armory, 31 nights. 
</P>
<P>
Passorello admitted that although armory programs are supposed to be uniform, 
interpretations vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing some liberal interpretation of rules, but unless there is 
flagrant abuse we kind of give them leeway," she said. "If you look at 
California weather patterns between December and March, most cities are within 
the criteria 90% of the time anyway, so we are not going to ask them to move in 
and out of the armories." 
</P>
<P>
Homeless advocates suggest that local areas should be given more authority to 
decide when to open armories, that weather conditions such as wind chill factor 
and wet ground be considered and that they be available more hours during the 
day when not being used by the guard. 
</P>
<P>
They are also lobbying the state to improve shower and restroom facilities. 
</P>
<P>
But nearly all concede that use of the armories remains at best a stop-gap 
measure. "Certainly expanded use of the armories would be cheaper than building 
more shelters," Knepprath said. "But it is not the homeless program of choice. 
It's a big Band-Aid when what we need is a tourniquet."

ANAHEIM MAY SEEK LIQUOR BAN AFTER RAP MELEE

<P>
Mayor Fred Hunter said Friday that he may seek a ban on beer and wine sales at 
the Celebrity Theatre in the wake of clashes among rap concert fans that left 
one juvenile with a gunshot wound and forced police to clear out the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"This one is hard to talk about," Police Sgt. Chet Barry said of the frenzied 
events Thursday night that led to the cancellation of sold-out performances by 
the rappers Ice Cube of Los Angeles and Too Short of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, what we've got is a juvenile shot through and through, and we don't 
know how or by whom," Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Theater officials refused Friday to comment on the violence, but city leaders 
and downtown residents said the theater has become a magnet for unruly crowds. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to put a lid on this," Councilman Irv Pickler said. "I think we have 
to tighten up security. I don't like what happened, especially in the downtown 
area that we are trying to clean up." 
</P>
<P>
Hunter, whose law office is just across the street from the theater, was 
receiving calls and visits Friday morning from local residents either 
frightened or angered at what took place outside their homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"If they (theater management) cannot provide proper security, then perhaps they 
need to go elsewhere," Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor said one way to bring a change would be to seek an end to beer and 
wine sales at the theater. Hunter said he will ask for a police review of 
disturbances at the downtown venue during the last three years and bring the 
matter to the City Council for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter also questioned the theater's booking of such performers as Ice Cube, 
known for his often-graphic references to gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
"What needs to happen with Celebrity management is to stop booking acts that 
cause these kinds of problems," Hunter said. "If the problem continues, we'll 
do everything in our power to pull their (alcohol) license." 
</P>
<P>
Signs of Thursday night's violence were still evident by midmorning Friday: 
Yellow police tape used for crowd control remained draped on theater handrails, 
trash was scattered out front and an abandoned high-heel shoe was still 
standing upright on a nearby retaining wall. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police said they came away from an interview with the 16-year-old 
victim with few clues about who shot him with a handgun or what led to the 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, identified by hospital officials as Willie Baker of Los Angeles, 
was reported in fair condition Friday at Long Beach Memorial Hospital with a 
wound to the abdomen and an exit wound out his back. 
</P>
<P>
What police are relatively sure of is that the shooting -- which occurred just 
outside the theater entrance shortly after 9 p.m. -- and the violence inside 
the theater were unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
A witness to the shooting, 19-year-old Chari Hariston of Los Angeles, said she 
saw "a short, dark-skinned man in a long black coat" calling out to his friends 
in gang jargon and threatening to shoot people as they stood waiting to enter 
the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Hariston said another man recognized the first man and punched him in the back 
of the head, reportedly prompting the gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
"A gun went pop, and everybody started screaming," a shaken Hariston said 
Thursday night. "Everybody dived. Everybody was running." 
</P>
<P>
Inside the theater, disturbances started shortly after 9:30 p.m., when patrons 
began fighting in the audience. Some fans poured onto the stage apron as chairs 
were being thrown below the rotating circular stage during Too Short's second 
number. 
</P>
<P>
The show was stopped at 9:37 p.m. Police said theater officials called off the 
performances at 10:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity Theatre manager Alex Haddad said Friday that his attorney is 
preparing a statement about the incidents and that until it is completed he 
will have no comments. 
</P>
<P>
John Reese, president of Phoenix-based VIP Security Services, which provided 
security for the event, said he believes that the problems were heightened by 
late-arriving crowds. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't so much getting the people in as that they showed up late," he said. 
"Everybody showed up at once. The problem is when the gunfire went off, people 
rushed the doors. . . . With a situation like this where there is gunfire, 
people panic. According to my personnel, all the patrons panicked." 
</P>
<P>
Police were already at the scene, and within minutes of the shooting more than 
30 officers had stopped traffic on surrounding streets, while a police 
helicopter searched overhead for the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
While clearing the area, authorities arrested three men, who were held on 
suspicion of obstructing a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Tom Daly said Anaheim Police Chief Joseph T. Molloy was asked Friday 
to prepare a personal report of the violence and present it for the council's 
consideration. 
</P>

"I want the opportunity to discuss this with the police chief and the city 
manager," Daly said. "If it's a security problem, let's add more security. If 
it's an alcohol problem, let's remove the alcohol. No matter what we do, I'd 
like to deal with this problem head-on." 
</P>
<P>
Many downtown area residents and business people were angry Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Margie Hilgenfeld-Field, who operates a mortuary across the street from the 
theater, said several residents called her Thursday night and held the 
telephone receiver out their window so she could hear the disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
"I could hear the sirens, the helicopter and the dogs barking," said 
Hilgenfeld-Field, who went to the theater Friday morning to express her concern 
to Mayor Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
"What are we going to do about this?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
Hilgenfeld-Field said previous concerts at the theater have disrupted evening 
funeral services.

HEARING: TESTIMONIALS AND THE PRESENCE OF FERVENT SUPPORTERS DOESN'T SWAY A 
JUDGE WHO REFUSES TO LIFT AN ORDER BARRING CHARLES WESLEY TURNER JR. FROM 
PRACTICING.

<P>
Armed with testimonials from patients and backed by a small army of 
well-wishers, including ministers, poor immigrants and pregnant women, Anaheim 
obstetrician Dr. Charles Wesley Turner Jr. went to court Friday to defend his 
right to practice medicine. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County Superior Court Judge Eileen C. Moore refused to lift a 
temporary restraining order that bars Turner from practice while the Medical 
Board of California attempts to revoke his license permanently. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Turner has exposed both mothers and babies to unnecessary risks," said 
Moore, who served as a nurse in Vietnam. "He has generally exercised poor 
judgment and he should not be allowed to practice obstetrics." 
</P>
<P>
"I practice top medicine," Turner said as he left Moore's courtroom. "I don't 
practice second-rate medicine." He predicted that he will be vindicated after a 
full hearing before the Medical Board in January. 
</P>
<P>
Two babies have died under Turner's care since August. The Medical Board 
alleges that Turner has been grossly negligent in the treatment of at least 20 
patients since 1987, that his incompetence and negligence caused the death of 
at least one newborn, and that "he is a menace to the health and safety of the 
mothers and babies he treats." 
</P>
<P>
Among the doctor's backers Friday was the mother of a baby whose delivery 
Turner speeded up so that the infant could be displayed at the Melodyland 
Christian Center at midnight last New Year's Eve. Though the state alleges that 
Turner acted negligently in his handling of that birth, the mother, Brigitte 
Palmer, said neither she nor her daughter, Myra, were harmed by the experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Even after all the allegations I've heard today, I'm pregnant and I'm 
expecting my third child, and I want him to deliver it," Palmer said in the 
courthouse hallway after the judge ruled against Turner. 
</P>
<P>
In a spirited courtroom defense, Turner's attorney, Roy O. Moss Jr., argued 
that Turner is a competent, caring, Christian physician who treats immigrants 
and the indigent regardless of their ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that overburdened emergency rooms and hospitals are no longer welcoming 
uninsured women, even those in labor, Moss said that Turner's removal will hurt 
the needy most. 
</P>
<P>
"The poor people are going to suffer -- the ones that only have Medi-Cal or no 
medical insurance and can't find a hospital to take them," he argued. 
</P>
<P>
Moss contended that the fetal death rate of infants at Turner's Covenant 
Birthing Center, located on the grounds of Melodyland, is 1.3 per 1,000 live 
births. That compares with an Orange County average of 6.4 deaths in 1988, Moss 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you review Dr. Turner's records on infant and maternal mortality, he's the 
guy that everybody in this county ought to go to," Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
Gesturing to a courtroom packed with at least 50 supporters, some of whom 
clutched Bibles and quietly held their palms up in a gesture of charismatic 
prayer, Moss argued that Turner's patients were "voting with their feet" by 
attending the hearing. At one point, Turner's backers murmured their support 
for Moss' arguments, and the judge ordered them to be silent. 
</P>
<P>
Moss said that 51 people, including two doctors and scores of patients, had 
submitted letters to the court in Turner's defense. He said that Turner had not 
had time to have other doctors review his cases and rebut the Medical Board's 
"expert" testimony. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations against Turner, Moss argued, are based on a review of 12 of the 
doctor's worst cases. But the 65-year-old physician should be judged by his 
entire record, because in delivering 19,000 babies, he has lost only one mother 
and eight infants, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
"I dare say if you took the 12 worst cases of any OB-GYN specialist in Orange 
County for the last four years, he's going to look bad," Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Moore appeared unconvinced by such arguments. At one point, she told 
Moss: "You seem to be implying that Dr. Turner has a right to 12 or so bad 
cases, just like a dog has a right to one free bite." 
</P>
<P>
Later, she said to the attorney: "You are arguing to me that Dr. Turner serves 
poor people and serves Christian people in Orange County. Because he does this 
service, does this mean the standard (of medical care) should be lowered?" 
</P>
<P>
The judge added: "Why should I expose the poor women or the rich women of 
Orange County to treatment like this?" 
</P>
<P>
Among the allegations against Turner are that he accepted high-risk patients, 
including a 14-year-old girl and a woman delivering twins, in a birthing center 
that was not equipped to handle cases that developed complications. 
</P>
<P>
The Medical Board also alleges that Turner ruptured pregnant women's membranes 
and needlessly used forceps to remove babies; that in one case he discharged as 
normal a child with obvious birth defects who died a year later from its 
deformities, and that he failed to diagnose gestational diabetes, fetal growth 
retardation and other problems. In court papers filed Friday, Turner denies 
these allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The Medical Board is also investigating the Thanksgiving Day death of a 12 
1/2-pound baby girl delivered at the birthing center, Deputy Atty. Gen. 
Margaret Lafko said. An emergency team from UCI Medical Center in Orange was 
summoned to the birthing center after the baby was born with the umbilical cord 
wrapped around its neck and never began to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
The team reported finding Turner attending the mother, while the doctor's wife 
was attempting to resuscitate the baby by mouth through a tube, according to 
court records. The oxygen tanks in the birthing center were empty, the UCI 
team's records show. 
</P>
<P>
Turner disputes this, saying in court documents that the baby was stillborn and 
that a full tank of oxygen was available in the delivery room closet had it 
been needed. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, however, also noted that Turner has been disciplined by the 
Medical Board once before after giving improper drug prescriptions to an 
undercover medical investigator in 1981. In 1984, court records show, Turner's 
license was placed on probation for five years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Turner's admitting privileges at Santa Ana Hospital Medical Center 
were revoked after a peer review found that he had provided substandard care to 
40% of his patients. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are looking at is almost a 10-year history of a physician providing 
incompetent care," prosecutor Lafko told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Because Turner owns the birthing center and is not subject to peer review, the 
Medical Board hears about problems only when patients complain -- and Turner's 
patients, a majority of whom are low-income Latino women, rarely complain about 
substandard care, Lafko argued. 
</P>
<P>
Several of Turner's patients on Friday called that charge unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"He literally saved my life," said Frank Brasel, a missionary who commutes from 
Victorville to be treated by Turner. Brasel said that both he and his wife, 
Faith, had medical problems uncovered by Turner that had gone undiagnosed by 
other physicians, and claimed that his own medical care would be jeopardized by 
the state's action. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do I go now?" Brasel asked, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"I have insurance. . . . I am intelligent. I am knowledgeable. I have a choice. 
I choose Dr. Turner. This court has put my life at risk." 
</P>
<P>
"We deeply feel that there is a wrongful accusation against him," agreed Mai 
Tieu Hoang. The 40-year-old refugee said that Turner has sponsored her and more 
than 20 relatives who fled Vietnam in 1975, and at one time had had 50 refugees 
living under his roof. "He's very warmhearted, very caring. He would do 
anything to help people. 
</P>
<P>
"My children were delivered by him and they were safe under his care and they 
were healthy and intelligent," Hoang testified. 
</P>
<P>
An administrative hearing at which the Medical Board will seek to revoke 
Turner's license is scheduled for late January and is expected to run for at 
least two weeks, Lafko said.

HOW A RAP CONCERT BURST INTO VIOLENCE

<P>
The following account of the incidents at the Celebrity Theatre Thursday night 
is based, in part, on reports by Times pop music writer Mike Boehm, who was in 
the theater reviewing the rap show, and Times staff photographer Alexander 
Gallardo, who was outside when a teen-ager was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 As rap shows go, the one at the Celebrity Theatre on Thursday night was fairly 
ordinary in the beginning. As usual, patrons lined up outside, waiting to be 
searched for weapons and contraband. Inside, the audience danced and rocked to 
the frenetic beat. 
</P>
<P>
But about an hour into the show, all hell broke loose outside. Later, 
skirmishes also erupted inside the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Some witnesses said the melee inside the theater that led to the show's 
cancellation was linked to the gunfire just outside that left a 16-year-old boy 
with a stomach wound. Others -- including the police -- said it appeared that 
the violence inside and outside the theater were not related. Some said gangs 
started the fights, while others -- including some performers -- said lax 
security and poor management heightened tensions and caused the crowd to erupt. 
</P>
<P>
Amid all of the conflicting accounts, one thing is clear: The actions of a few 
troublemakers quickly turned a few hours of enjoyment for 2,500 happy rap fans 
into a chaotic frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
The star attraction for the evening was Ice Cube, the outspoken rapper formerly 
with Compton rap group N.W.A. A sellout crowd traveled from all over the 
Southland to see his performance, but he never made it on stage. 
</P>
<P>
The show began at 8 p.m. with Kid Rock, who was followed, after about 20 
minutes, by another rapper from Los Angeles, Yo-Yo. Fans who got past the 
security checkpoints in time for the opening acts were enjoying themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"It's harder to get into here tonight than Fort Knox," said Gary D, a disc 
jockey at radio station KDAY-AM and the show's master of ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
Before the trouble started, he said there was "nothing to be scared about. 
We're just here to have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
Outside in the cold, the situation grew tense. At 9 p.m., an hour after the 
show started, hundreds of concert-goers were still lined up, waiting to be 
frisked and scanned with hand-held metal detectors by staffers from VIP 
Security Services. 
</P>
<P>
"That's normal at a rap show," John Reese, president of Phoenix-based VIP, said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd began to grow impatient at the slow search procedures. Patrons who 
had already been searched began to back up into the line of people waiting to 
be searched. Security staff members suspended the operation until everyone who 
had been searched entered the theater, further angering those still waiting in 
line. 
</P>
<P>
"They let these people stay out here way too long, man," said a man who 
identified himself as a manager of rapper Too Short, one of the evening's acts. 
"If they'd opened the door up an hour and a half earlier, everything would be 
fine. The Celebrity (Theatre) provoked this." 
</P>
<P>
Reese argued that the delay was caused by many of the fans showing up near show 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't so much getting the people in as that they showed up late," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 9 p.m., the crowd's anger overflowed. A throng of fans stampeded 
past the checkpoint, toward the open doors. But the security staff controlled 
the situation in seconds, tossing out those who passed the checkpoint and 
closely guarding the glass doors. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd started lining up in an orderly fashion when suddenly a man wearing a 
long black coat began walking along the line, taunting waiting concert-goers, 
said a witness, Chari Hariston, 19, of Los Angeles. A moment later, someone ran 
up and punched the man in the head. 
</P>
<P>
Then a shot rang out. 
</P>
<P>
"A gun went pop and everybody started screaming," Hariston said. "Everybody 
dived. Everybody was running." 
</P>
<P>
The victim, later identified by hospital officials as Willie Baker, 16, of Los 
Angeles, lay on the sidewalk with a handgun entry wound in his stomach and an 
exit wound in his back. His was reported in fair condition Friday after 
emergency surgery at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the theater was confusion. Some witnesses said it was because some in 
the audience heard the gunshot and panicked. Others said it was because 
security guards who had been tightly guarding the stage ran out to the 
sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
At about 9:35 p.m., Too Short was a few minutes into his act when the stage was 
overrun with fans. The disc jockey booth near the apron of the circular stage 
was surrounded. Fans waved their arms and laughed, giddy at being on stage with 
the rappers. The houselights came on, but Too Short kept rapping. 
</P>
<P>
By 9:37, the stage was filled with fans. Too Short abandoned his act. About 
half of the fans filed into the lobby -- adding to confusion near the shooting 
scene -- while the rest stayed to see whether the show would go on. Gary D, the 
emcee, came on stage to pass a police message to the remaining crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Anaheim P.D. is backstage," he said. "They want to shut this down. . . . If we 
keep our seats and not come on stage for the rest of the show, the show can go 
on. It's as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police were taking action outside the theater too. After the shooting, 
they refused to let anyone else inside, angering some in an already tense and 
frightened crowd. Some people refused to leave and were arrested. A police 
helicopter swooped down on the theater's parking garage to chase off some fans 
who had gathered there. 
</P>
<P>
At 10:10 p.m., Ice Cube's road crew came on stage and began packing up his 
gear. Five minutes later, a theater staff member made a terse announcement: 
"Ladies and gentleman, the remainder of tonight's show has been canceled." 
</P>
<P>
But the evening didn't end there. Amara Faulkner, 14, of Torrance, said she and 
a friend were leaving the theater when they were attacked by youths who 
snatched her friend's chains. 
</P>
<P>
"They robbed my home girl," she said. "They ripped her clothes. They stole her 
chains. She was running and trying to fight them off, but there were too many 
of them."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
JUDGE UPHOLDS 1987 MURDER CONVICTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County judge Friday refused to set aside the 1987 second-degree 
murder conviction of a Huntington Beach man who won an appellate court decision 
to temporarily overturn his conviction for selling the drug PCP to a surfer who 
later drowned. 
</P>
<P>
The 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana had found errors in the 
instructions given to the jury that convicted Mark Taylor, 34, in the death of 
Adrian Obregon, 18. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1987, Obregon bought PCP from Taylor shortly before entering the 
water at Huntington State Beach, where he drowned. The case marked the first 
time Orange County prosecutors had ever sought a murder conviction against a 
drug supplier when the drug was not directly the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors successfully argued that even though Taylor, now serving a sentence 
of 15 years to life in prison, did not intend to harm Obregon, death would not 
have occurred if Obregon hadn't been on PCP. But the appellate court found that 
Judge Richard J. Beacom had not properly instructed the jurors on what the 
standard for guilt should be in such a case. 
</P>
<P>
So the district attorney's office asked the state Supreme Court to reconsider 
the appellate decision. The high court agreed and defined the standard for 
guilt in such cases: that the drug supplier in such a situation knows there is 
a "high probability" of death. The high court then sent the case back to 
Beacom.. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Beacom found that the case met that "high probability" standard and 
refused to reverse Taylor's conviction. Taylor's lawyers indicated they would 
appeal Beacom's ruling. JERRY HICKS

Several law enforcement agencies plan to set up sobriety checkpoints in hope of 
taking drunk drivers off the road during the New Year's holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies will set up a checkpoint in Laguna Niguel tonight on Street 
of the Golden Lantern between Marina Hills Drive and Hidden Hills Road. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove police will set up checkpoints at two undisclosed locations from 
tonight until New Year's Day. The California Highway Patrol plans to operate 
one checkpoint at an undisclosed location tonight. 
</P>
<P>
One day last weekend, Garden Grove police saw 1,100 cars pass through a 
checkpoint without making an arrest, Lt. Bill Dalton said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that these (checkpoints) are working," Dalton said. 
</P>
<P>
Signs are posted along roads to alert drivers that a checkpoint has been set 
up. Drivers have a chance to turn off at a cross street before coming to the 
checkpoint, said Sheriff's Lt. Joe Davis of Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
If traffic is heavy, officers may stop every 15th car or so, he said. More cars 
are stopped if traffic is light. 
</P>
<P>
At a checkpoint on Crown Valley Parkway on Dec. 14, officers stopped 889 cars 
of 1,690 that passed through, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Many times, officers encounter people who have been selected as the designated 
sober driver for the evening and are ferrying passengers who have had too much 
to drink. "The sobriety checkpoints really are a deterrence factor," Davis 
said.MARY ANNE PEREZ

<P>
Police warned the public Friday to look out for a man who has been exposing 
himself to women walking or jogging alone in the Eastbluff and Back Bay areas 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The man, 25 to 30 years old, has been dubbed the Potbelly Flasher because of 
his protruding stomach, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect has not touched any of his victims, but girls and women 12 to 40 
years old have been terrified by his actions. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Tim Newman said the same man has apparently committed six flashings 
beginning in October, from 2 to 7 p.m. The most recent incident was Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"In some cases, the suspect runs alongside of the victims and exposes himself," 
Newman said. "In others, he approaches them from brush along the road." 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was described as about 5 feet, 9 inches and 170 to 200 pounds, with 
dirty blond hair cut short but protruding slightly over the ears. He has a 
"protruding and extremely white stomach," police said. The flasher sometimes 
has worn sunglasses.

HOUSE FIRE BLAMED ON FAULTY CHIMNEY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A poorly constructed chimney was to blame for a house fire that destroyed the 
attic and caused about $35,000 worth of damage to the roof, firefighters said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze occurred about 9 p.m. Thursday at 17 Oxbow Creek Lane when the 
residents lighted some logs in their fireplace, said Orange County Fire Capt. 
Dan Young. 
</P>
<P>
The chimney was missing an 18-inch metal section, and heat from the fire 
ignited the walls of the chimney near the attic. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears to be a construction error," Young said. 
</P>

A motorist passing the house saw smoke rising from the roof and ran to the door 
to notify the residents, Young said. The residents, who had moved into the 
house earlier this month, then called 911. Eighteen firefighters put out the 
blaze in about 15 minutes. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the missing section, "it appears the fireplace was built for 
only small natural-gas-type fires and could not withstand the heat of 
wood-burning fires," Young said. He cautioned other residents in the area to 
make sure that their fireplaces are built for wood-burning fires.MATT LAIT

After several years of serving a bowl of holiday leftovers, this year the 
Freedom Bowl offers something different. So what if Oregon and Colorado State 
aren't haute cuisine? At least these teams aren't the warmed-over remnants of 
seasons gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
No more teams such as Florida, which sold only 1,200 tickets before slogging 
through the final comedown of a disappointing season in last year's game. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Oregon and Colorado State are happy to be here, as both coaches and any 
third-string free safety seemed pleased to say this week, prompted or not. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon is making its bid for respectability by playing in consecutive bowl 
games for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming from the University of Oregon, it feels like back-to-back Super Bowls," 
said Michael McClellan, a senior flanker. 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks have built their 8-3 record on the arm of Bill Musgrave, who was the 
All-Pacific 10 quarterback, despite the attention devoted to others. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State is positively giddy over its first bowl game in 42 years, 
getting a sequel, at long last, to its 1949 Raisin Bowl appearance. It has 
taken only two years for Earle Bruce, the former Ohio State coach, to bring the 
Rams from 1-10 to 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
Is this game a comedown for a man who took the Buckeyes to two Rose Bowl games? 
Bruce, his ability proved once again, just smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"I've also been in the Peach, the Liberty, the Hall of Fame, the Fiesta," Bruce 
said. "I've been to the Citrus Bowl and the Tangerine. I can't say I haven't 
had all the experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't feel any different. I think it's different for the kids. I've never 
coached a more appreciative football team than this. Sometimes in other 
programs, they don't appreciate it. They have been so receptive and worked so 
hard. We're not the most talented football team, but we have some talent." 
</P>
<P>
All this good feeling came by design, not happenstance, said Don Andersen, the 
game's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was important to have teams here that were anxious to be here," 
Andersen said, calling it "the game plan" to get teams from the Pac-10 and the 
Western Athletic Conference. "We didn't even go to the Big Ten, the SEC, Notre 
Dame. We took a very practical approach." 
</P>
<P>
Oregon is favored in this match, billed as a battle between the Ducks' passing 
offense, in which Musgrave has averaged 222 yards a game, and Colorado State's 
multiple-formation ground game. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon Coach Rich Brooks is encouraged that his offense will be stronger than 
it was in the final two games, when an injury-depleted unit failed to score a 
touchdown while losing to California, 28-3, and defeating Oregon State, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Musgrave has had time to recover from several injuries, the most recent of 
which kept him out of the last six quarters of the regular season with a bruise 
in his throwing shoulder. Two receivers are back after undergoing arthroscopic 
knee surgery, McClellan and Joe Reitzug. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, tailback Sean Burwell, a redshirt freshman who led the team with 949 
yards rushing after being forced into action because of an early-season injury 
to the starter, is back after missing most of the Oregon State game because of 
a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all healthy," Brooks said. "It makes me feel a little better about our 
chances on the offensive side since we struggled so much in the last two games 
of the year." 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks are not as sound on defense, where they lost senior Peter Brantley, 
an all-conference outside linebacker, because of a strained left knee suffered 
in practice last week in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State also has had time for an important player to heal. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Alford, a tailback who ran for 1,035 yards last season, has been bothered 
by a right hamstring pull and later by a strained tendon in his right foot. He 
rushed for 647 yards, but started only one game. The bulk of the ground work 
went to Brian Copeland and Todd Yert, a short-yardage fullback who has put his 
head down and bulled to 16 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Alford, there's a guy who hasn't been well all year," Bruce said. "He's going 
to see the football quite a bit -- if we get the football quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce keeps his own counsel as to which of two rotating quarterbacks he will 
start -- Mike Gimenez, the better option quarterback and the starter in the 
past five games, or Kevin Verdugo, the better passer, who was slowed by a 
shoulder injury late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Known to surprise even his assistants with his choice of a starter, Bruce 
strayed from an earlier expectation that Gimenez would start and said Friday, 
"I think probably (it would be) Verdugo, if we had to start right now." 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, Colorado State lost a starter in the secondary this week when 
Harlan Carroll came down with what was diagnosed as mononucleosis. That will 
put added pressure on a defensive backfield already facing a great deal of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Musgrave throws the ball, and if you overdo (setting the defense for) that, 
they'll run the ball and put it in the end zone," Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon must be watchful of the curse of the favorite: overconfidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm obviously concerned that could be the case with our team," Brooks said. 
"There's no question Colorado State is challenged. Earle Bruce is challenged 
when he gets up in the morning. There's no question they'll be ready to play 
and come out and bloody our noses." 
</P>
<P>
Freedom Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
The kickoff is at 5 p.m. for the game, which will be on Channel 9 and the 
Raycom Sports Network. The game was televised by NBC last year. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon had sold 18,000 tickets as of Friday, and Colorado State had made 8,000 
of a total of 11,800 guaranteed sales by the Western Athletic Conference. An 
additional 10,000 tickets were sold by the Orange County Sports Assn., and 
another 10,000 have been given away for distribution to military families. 
About 3,000 in walk-up sales are expected. The record for ticket sales is 
56,910, set in 1986 for the UCLA-Brigham Young game. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State Coach Earle Bruce was asked for his reaction to Air Force's 
upset of Ohio State, his former employer. Bruce beamed good-naturedly. "That's 
a good question. I've been waiting for that one. . . . Great coaching job by 
(Air Force Coach) Fisher DeBerry. That was a great win for us as a conference, 
a prestige win that shows the WAC is coming of age."

FREEDOM BOWL CHRONOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
1984 
</P>
<P>
Final score: Iowa 55, Texas 17. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance: 24,093. 
</P>
<P>
MVPs: Chuck Long, Iowa quarterback (29 for 39, 461 yards, six touchdowns); 
William Harris, Texas tight end (six catches, 37 yards, one touchdown). 
</P>
<P>
What happened: In a driving rain, Long threw a Freedom Bowl-record six 
touchdown passes, each to a different receiver. Iowa took a 14-0 lead in the 
first quarter, but Texas rallied to cut the margin to 24-17 at halftime. The 
Hawkeyes then scored 31 consecutive points in the third quarter and limited the 
Texas offense to 112 yards and five first downs in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
1985 
</P>
<P>
Final score: Washington 20, Colorado 17. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance: 30,961. 
</P>
<P>
MVPs: Chris Chandler, Washington quarterback (15 for 26, 141 yards); Barry 
Helton, Colorado punter (one for one passing, 31 yards, one touchdown; 
39.0-yard punting average, one punt for 54 yards). 
</P>
<P>
What happened: Colorado drove to the Washington five in the fourth quarter but 
lost the ball on the fumble as the Huskies held on. Tony Covington's one-yard 
scoring run in the third quarter and Jeff Jaeger's 18-yard field goal in the 
fourth provided the winning points. Colorado pulled to 20-17 on Helton's pass 
to Jon Embree off a fake field-goal attempt early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
1986 
</P>
<P>
Final score: UCLA 31, BYU 10. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance: 51,422. 
</P>
<P>
MVPs: Gaston Green, UCLA tailback (33 carries, 266 yards, three touchdowns; one 
for one passing, 13 yards, one touchdown); Shane Shumway, BYU defensive back 
(five unassisted tackles, one interception, two passes broken up). 
</P>
<P>
What happened: Green was the story, rushing for three touchdowns and throwing 
for another. The Bruins scored 17 consecutive points in the third quarter, on 
runs of one and 79 yards by Green (the former set up by a 70-yard run by Marcus 
Greenwood) and a 49-yard field goal by Dave Franey. Green finished his 
impressive day with a 13-yard halfback option pass to Karl Dorrell. 
</P>
<P>
1987 
</P>
<P>
Final score: Arizona State 33, Air Force 28. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance: 33,261. 
</P>
<P>
MVPs: Daniel Ford, Arizona State quarterback (16 of 30, 272 yards, one 
touchdown); Chad Hennings, Air Force defensive tackle (12 unassisted tackles 
(three for 12 yards in losses), two sacks). 
</P>
<P>
What happened: Arizona State took a 24-14 halftime lead with 24 second-quarter 
points, then held on as the Falcons rallied behind third-string quarterback 
Lance McDowell. Arizona State's second quarter included the longest pass in 
Freedom Bowl history, 61 yards from Daniel Ford to Aaron Cox, who is now with 
the Rams. Air Force played without standout quarterback Dee Dowis, who was out 
with a fractured wrist. Steve Letnich started the game and drove the Falcons to 
the game's first touchdown, but he was relieved by McDowell, who directed two 
long scoring drives in the fourth quarter, each ending on a touchdown pass to 
Steve Senn. 
</P>
<P>
1988 
</P>
<P>
Final score: BYU 20, Colorado 17. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance: 35,941. 
</P>
<P>
MVPs: Ty Detmer, BYU quarterback (11 for 17, 129 yards, one touchdown); Eric 
Bieniemy, Colorado halfback, 33 carries, 144 yards, two touchdowns; two 
catches, 20 yards). 
</P>
<P>
What happened: The game was a preview of things to come for Detmer, this year's 
Heisman Trophy winner, and Bieniemy, who finished third in the balloting. 
Detmer, then a freshman, came off the bench in relief of Sean Covey and led the 
Cougars on a 65-yard drive that ended with a 14-yard pass to Chuck Cutler, 
tying the score, 14-14. Two fourth-quarter field goals by Jason Chaffetz 
provided the winning margin for BYU. The second, from 35 yards, came with about 
three minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
Final score: Washington 34, Florida 7. 
</P>
<P>
Attendance: 33,858. 
</P>
<P>
MVPs: Cary Conklin, Washington quarterback (21 for 39, 217 yards, two 
touchdowns); Huey Richardson, Florida linebacker (nine unassisted tackles (two 
for losses), one sack, three passes broken up). 
</P>
<P>
What happened: The Gators didn't put up much of a fight. Perhaps they were 
distracted by speculation concerning their next coach (Duke's Steve Spurrier, 
the 1966 Heisman Trophy winner from Florida, was named the next day). Junior 
running back Emmitt Smith, playing his final college game before jumping to the 
NFL, was held to 17 yards in seven carries by the Husky defense. Washington 
scored four times in the first half, including one touchdown off a blocked 
punt, to take a 27-7 lead. Greg Lewis provided rushing support for Conklin, 
gaining 97 yards in 27 carries.

CONSULTANTS ARE SPREADING WORD ON WORLD TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRISTINA LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 15 years, Ryusuke Hoshino worked his way up the bureaucratic ranks of the 
Japan External Trade Organization in Tokyo to become the director of its 
prestigious U.S. market research division. 
</P>
<P>
As a top official in the Japanese government trade organization, Hoshino 
traveled extensively to help expand his nation's trade ties with countries in 
North America, Asia, Europe and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
But one day, he did the unthinkable in Japanese society. He quit his job at age 
40, moved his family to Santa Ana, where he has many friends and business 
associates, and started his own international trade-consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
In so doing, Hoshino joined a growing legion of business people who are forming 
their own international consulting firms to take advantage of a boom in 
international trade. 
</P>
<P>
Hoshino and others like him see opportunity in the political and economic 
changes that are sweeping the world, changes that are already altering the 
complexion of global commerce. The thawing of Cold War tensions has meant an 
easing of trade restrictions between the West and East. And the removal of 
trade barriers among the 13-member nations of the European Economic Community 
will create new opportunities in that market beginning in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pacific Rim countries like Japan and Taiwan are slowly opening their 
markets to foreign products to help shrink huge trade surpluses with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
And, of equal importance, a sluggish U.S. economy has prompted many American 
firms to get serious about selling abroad to help fuel their growth. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, 1990 was a big year for international deals. There were 
transactions to sell fuel-cleaning systems in Spain, hamburger franchises in 
Indonesia, computer hardware to China, Playboy and other magazines in the 
Soviet Union and to mine gold in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
And these deals sparked demand by companies in Orange County and elsewhere for 
consultants who specialize in a particular country's business practices, 
government regulations, customs and language. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, there was a 25% jump in requests for consultants, according to Carl 
Kline, president of National Consultant Referrals, a San Diego firm that 
matches companies with professional consultants. In 1990, his firm has logged 
more than 12,500 calls from companies seeking consultants. About one-fourth of 
the approximately 4,000 consultants listed in the firm's referral service were 
added this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Many companies, especially during an economic slowdown, do not want to keep a 
very expensive permanent staff, so they keep a small core staff to keep their 
overhead low and use consultants for special projects," Kline said. 
</P>
<P>
One consultant new to the trade is Bernard Jubb, formerly a communications 
director for MAI Systems Corp., a Tustin computer company. 
</P>
<P>
Jubb was laid off during a corporate restructuring at MAI in October. 
</P>
<P>
Jubb, a native of Great Britain, hopes to use his knowledge of Western European 
markets to help U.S. companies seeking business in those markets after European 
economic unification in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, his familiarity with the U.S. market, he reasons, may be useful to 
European companies that want to sell their products in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I can do the marketing studies and test market their products for them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"What I don't have is a lot of corporate resources, but I have the ability to 
make fast decisions and move very quickly to put my decisions into action." 
</P>
<P>
The lure of increased trade opportunities have also prompted executives in 
troubled businesses to get into the consulting field. Markram Nawar, a Newport 
Beach developer, turned to consulting when the housing market went into a 
slump. 
</P>
<P>
Nawar, an Egyptian immigrant, has helped U.S. and Canadian companies put 
together barter trade deals with the Soviets, working through an Egyptian firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Opportunity came, and I had the contacts, so I put the deal together," said 
Nawar, who is paid consulting fees by Egyptian and Canadian companies. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized it's so easy to make money in trading and consulting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by his success, Nawar has decided to set up an export-import and 
trade consulting business, which he hopes will carry him through until the real 
estate market recovers. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. companies are learning that each foreign market is unique, and they are 
increasingly hiring consultants who are knowledgeable about those markets, said 
Pete Maddox, a managing partner of the Lido Group in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Maddox was one of several consultants who worked with Speedy International, an 
Orange-based company that set up several quick-printing franchises in India, 
Japan and Western Europe in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Each foreign market that American companies do business with has its own 
highly unique characteristics and those who understand and adapt to those 
characteristics succeed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone has the expertise to become a consultant, said Kline, of 
National Consultant Referrals. 
</P>
<P>
A consultant is an expert in a specific field and other areas such as 
marketing, contracts and pricing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our database contains experts in their chosen fields and does not include 
temporarily unemployed executives," Kline said. 
</P>
<P>
"We require the person to have successfully done one or two consulting 
assignments." 
</P>
<P>
Hiring an inexperienced consultant can result in deals collapsing after a 
considerable investment of time and money, soured relations with an 
international partner and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
The best way for a company to determine if a consultant is qualified for a job, 
Kline advises, is to examine his or her track record in arranging similar 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
The National Bureau of Professional Management Consultants in San Diego has 
pushed for a consultant certification program, similar to the test that 
accountants must pass to become a certified public accountant.

EXCHANGES ASKED TO TIGHTEN 'SPECIALISTS' RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a report on the October, 1989, 
market drop, called on the nation's two major stock exchanges Friday to tighten 
performance standards for professionals who regulate trading flow. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC said the New York and American stock exchanges performed well overall 
during the 190-point tumble in the Dow Jones industrial average Oct. 13, 1989, 
and during a sharp rise on Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
But the report cited several problems on the exchanges and at the automated 
National Assn. of Securities Dealers system, and called for several revisions 
in how trading is regulated. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC's division of market regulation said some exchange floor market makers, 
known in the industry as specialists, failed to perform adequately during the 
volatile trading. 
</P>
<P>
The market regulation division said the exchanges should review performances 
and take "appropriate remedial action." 
</P>
<P>
Specialists generally match buyers and sellers of stock but are required to 
correct imbalances by making purchases or sales from their own supplies when 
necessary to maintain fair and orderly markets. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC report said the exchanges should use their authority to reallocate 
stocks when they determine that specialists display a "substantial or continued 
failure" to maintain orderly markets. 
</P>
<P>
It also said the NYSE, Amex and regional stock exchanges should consider 
developing capital levels for specialists. 
</P>
<P>
The Amex said in a statement that it continually reviews specialists' 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
An NYSE spokesman could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The report was the second part of the SEC's analysis of the 1989 market slide. 
</P>
<P>
In June, the SEC concluded that the drop was accelerated by index arbitrage and 
other program trading strategies.

Mortgage Rates Rise a Bit: Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.68% this 
week, up from 9.64% last week, according to a national survey by the Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Two weeks ago, fixed-rate mortgages hit a 44-month low 
of 9.56% after peaking for 1990 at 10.67% during the week ending May 4. 
</P>
<P>
The average initial rate for one-year adjustable-rate mortgages was 7.92%, up 
from 7.86% last week, the lowest in 29 months. The one-year rate's high for 
1990 was 8.63% in the week ending May 11. Rates do not include add-on fees 
known as points.

First Palestinian-Owned Bank Gets OK in Israel: Israeli military authorities 
have granted permission for Palestinian business executives to set up the first 
Palestinian-owned commercial bank in the occupied territories, the bank's main 
investor said. 
</P>
<P>
Kamal Hassouneh, a businessman in the West Bank town of Hebron, said he 
received approval six years after applying and would meet Israeli central bank 
officials soon to discuss operations. The new bank, which has yet to be named, 
would be a full-service commercial bank and offer loans for industrial 
development. He said it would have initial capital of $15.2 million invested by 
Palestinian shareholders.

2 RIVALS MATCH SOME FARE CUTS BY SOUTHWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. DALLOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mini-fare war broke out Friday in the Southwest as competitors of Southwest 
Airlines matched the Dallas-based carrier's $20 one-way deep discount fares. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Southwest Airlines cut its fares between Phoenix and seven cities, 
including Los Angeles, Oakland, San Diego and Ontario. America West, 
Southwest's major competitor, on Friday matched fares between Phoenix and six 
of the cities, but it declined to apply the discount to the Phoenix-Oakland 
route. Delta Air Lines also said it would match the fares, but on a much more 
limited basis. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts also apply to fares from Phoenix to El Paso, Las Vegas and Reno and 
from Las Vegas to Reno and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
A typical one-way fare between Phoenix and El Paso or San Diego or Los Angeles 
would range from $49 to $51. There are no restrictions on the discounted fares 
except that they must be purchased through Jan. 20 for travel between Jan. 3 
and April 5. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this is starting a price war," said Dik Shimizu, a spokesman for 
Phoenix-based America West. "I think it is a continuation of an extremely low 
pricing environment and high competition between America West and Southwest." 
America West is dominant on some of the routes and Southwest on others. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest said it initiated the fare cuts to celebrate its 20th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of Southwest's financial strength, we are able to say 'thanks' to our 
customers in such a big way through this special fare," said Don Valentine, 
Southwest's vice president of marketing. A Southwest spokeswoman, Melanie 
Jones, said another reason was because "we are preparing for the first (1991) 
quarter, which is typically slow. The matching does not surprise me. Most 
airlines try to remain competitive on fares they have in common." 
</P>
<P>
Delta is a minor player on some of the routes subject to discounting. It has 
four non-stop round trips between Phoenix and Los Angeles. Between Phoenix and 
Las Vegas it has only two round trips. It says that it will respond to the 
Southwest fares only in those two markets and not on all flights. 
</P>
<P>
Delta spokesman William Berry said the Atlanta-based carrier will match the low 
fares on only two flights between Phoenix and Los Angeles in each direction. 
But it will offer the discounted fare only on one of its Las Vegas to Phoenix 
flights. 
</P>
<P>
"In all cases the seats will be limited," Berry said.

Just Didn't Sound Right: A victim of the savings and loan crisis -- on the 
language front, anyway -- has decided it's easier to switch than fight. S.N.L. 
Financial Corp. changed its name this week to Security National Financial Corp. 
to avoid confusion with the spoken shorthand for the industry known for 
multibillion-dollar losses and unscrupulous bankers. The company markets 
insurance and annuity products in 17 Western states, and owns and operates 
cemeteries and mortuaries in Utah and Arizona.

Family Wants 'Big Daddy' Released: The 6-year-old granddaughter of convicted 
Texas thrift owner Don R. Dixon is asking that he be released on bail until his 
sentencing in February on 23 counts of bank fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Candice Reeves and 79 other friends and relatives of Dixon wrote U.S. District 
Judge Joe Fish requesting a new bond hearing. Since his conviction Dec. 23 
Dixon has been held at a federal correctional facility. "Dear judge," she 
wrote, "Can big daddy get out of jail? He will not leave town. Love, Candice." 
His sentencing is Feb. 19, and prosecutors have asked that he stay in jail 
until then. They fear he will flee the country.

In Orange County, 1990 was a big year for international deals. There were deals 
to sell fuel-cleaning systems in Spain, hamburger franchises in Indonesia,

Comedian Jett Matthews has a fairly good sense of who he is. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty much a pessimistic optimist," Matthews says. "I think there will 
probably be a nuclear war, but not before Super Bowl Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
And, hopefully, not before the comedy show tonight at the Coach House in San 
Juan Capistrano, where Matthews will appear on a bill with comedians Jimmy 
McGee, Dick Hardwick and Shang. The four run the gamut of the comedy spectrum. 
There's Hardwick, who worked nine years at Disneyland, including five as the 
comic in the Golden Horseshoe Revue. The Fullerton resident talks a lot about 
his childhood in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are simpler in the Midwest," he says. "You either drink or you don't 
drink. Which makes choosing your religion a lot easier too. . . . It's easy to 
tell a rich person in Indiana: They've got two cars jacked up in the front 
yard." 
</P>
<P>
Hardwick, who does the audience warm-ups for "The Munsters Today" and Fox's 
"What a Dummy," plays several musical instruments in his act, including the 
drums, harmonica and jew's-harp. He is also known to "rap" the Miranda rights 
while moonwalking across the stage. 
</P>
<P>
As a comedian, Hardwick says, his goal is to have the audience walk away 
saying, "Gee, that was a lot of fun -- just like a ride at Disneyland!" 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Jimmy McGee, who grew up in a small town in Mississippi where he 
would often hang out in the streets watching the winos. 
</P>
<P>
That experience inspired one of his best routines. With the stage lights dimmed 
and the sound of a jazz piano playing in the background, he takes on the 
character of one of those bleary-eyed winos whose best friend is a bottle of 
cheap wine. 
</P>
<P>
In the routine, McGee's wino recognizes a young friend who has just gotten out 
of jail. "See, what I tell you about messin' with that cocaine?" McGee says to 
his friend. "It's not good for you. It's addictive." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking to his wine bottle, McGee says, "I can quit drinking you any time I 
want to." 
</P>
<P>
As he walks away, he drops the bottle. Then he picks up the unbroken bottle 
and, in a scolding tone, says: "Don't you try that again." 
</P>
<P>
McGee, who has opened for the Temptations, Debbie Harry and Ray Charles, uses 
his wino character to talk about everything from current events to 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad kind of statement on alcoholism, yet it's still funny," McGee says. 
"I think it makes you think and laugh at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Shang, who has appeared on Showtime and recently guested on "A Laugh, a Tear," 
a special on black American humor, describes his comedy as "bizarre, mixed with 
part reality." 
</P>
<P>
And just how bizarre and real is that? 
</P>
<P>
"I talk about cannibalism and racism," he said. "See, that's what I mean: You 
go from the bizarre to what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
Cannibals, according to Shang, love Domino's Pizza -- "not for the pizza, but 
for the delivery guy." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the pizza being delivered in 30 minutes or less, he says, "in their 
minds, it's 'victims in 30 minutes or less.' " 
</P>
<P>
As for racism, Shang says he believes that it's going to end soon: "The way the 
ozone layer is breaking down, I think everybody's going to be black." 
</P>
<P>
Jett Matthews, who has been a comedian for six years, is a "Cal State Fullerton 
dropout." 
</P>
<P>
"I studied political science, which means I can stand on any street corner in 
America and tell you the demographics of the '72 election -- for food." 
</P>
<P>
In his act, Matthews says, "I talk a little politics and a little rock 'n' roll 
-- a little bit of everything. It's a little bitter and a little stark. It's 
what I do." 
</P>
<P>
How bitter? 
</P>
<P>
"Just a tad, just a smidgen," he says. "I don't think everything's all dark. I 
just think it's something to be looked at and talked about. When people come to 
see a comedy show, I don't think they should forget everything. At the same 
time, I don't preach. It's just my opinions." 
</P>
<P>
Such as? 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't think there should be troops in Saudi Arabia," Matthews 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a good idea, because the more U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia the 
less Camaros on our highways. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think Orange County people will like that?" 
</P>
<P>
Matthews said he thinks most comics are insecure and do comedy because they're 
trying to get something from the audience that they didn't get at home when 
they were growing up. 
</P>
<P>
Not him: 
</P>
<P>
"I do comedy because I can't stop the voices in my head." 
</P>
<P>
Jett Matthews, Jimmy McGee, Dick Hardwick and Shang appear tonight at 9 at the 
Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $8. 
Information: (714) 496-8930.

A SAXOPHONIST OF MANY SOUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
MUSICIAN: BRANDON FIELDS, WHO GREW UP IN FOUNTAIN VALLEY AND WILL PLAY AT EL 
MATADOR ON MONDAY, DRAWS HIS INSPIRATION FROM MULTIPLE MUSICAL TRADITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Something old, something new. The phrase nicely sums up saxophonist Brandon 
Fields' source of musical inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"I still consider myself a student, listening to all different types of music 
and trying to apply them to my musical sense," he said. "I search out the new 
stuff, contemporary music, the stuff that's playing right now, as well as 
researching as much old material as I can find. For me, that's a never-ending 
process: to stay in touch with what's happening now as well as what's gone 
before." 
</P>
<P>
But Fields, who joins fluegelhornist Tony Guerrero and bassist Luther Hughes' 
trio New Year's Eve at El Matador restaurant in the Huntington Harbour Mall, 
has a sound that's decidedly contemporary. His latest recording, "Other Places" 
(Nova), gives the wily saxophonist a chance to squirm and scream on originals 
with solid bass lines and accessible rhythms that reflect an early exposure to 
pop music. 
</P>
<P>
"My roots are more R &amp; B-oriented," he explained recently from his home in 
North Hollywood. "I listened to a lot of Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Nancy 
Wilson. From them I learned how to perform, the art of nuance, how to deliver 
the material. There's something about the way a great singer puts across the 
melody that does something to me. I've been influenced more by singers, really, 
than saxophonists." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Indiana, Fields began his musical training while growing up in Fountain 
Valley. His mother, a keyboard major in college, started Fields and his three 
sisters on the piano at age 5. 
</P>
<P>
He credits his parents with providing lots of support. "They would go out and 
buy all kinds of instruments -- a trombone one week, a drum set the next. The 
one that really felt good to me was the alto," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He cites two experiences that turned him on to jazz. While he was in high 
school in Santa Ana, his father took him to see Supersax, the band dedicated to 
Charlie Parker charts. "I just liked the sound of five saxes playing together 
like that," he said. And there was the first time he heard saxophonist Michael 
Brecker. 
</P>
<P>
"It was about a year later," he said. "We'd gone to a concert in San Diego, and 
they were playing (drummer) Billy Cobham's album 'Crosswind' in-between Chicago 
and Santana. And I thought, 'Who is this guy playing sax?' It was better than 
the stuff we'd paid to see." 
</P>
<P>
Fields interrupted music studies at Cal State Fullerton in 1976 to travel with 
a Top 40 group in Canada. On his return, he hooked up with Charles (Doc) 
Rutherford's big band at Orange Coast College, where he met other Orange 
County-based musicians like trombonist Mike Fahn and fellow saxophonist Eric 
Marienthal. These associations led to a long engagement in the early '80s at 
the Studio Cafe in Balboa with, among others, Chick Corea's bassist John 
Patitucci. 
</P>
<P>
Fields has also worked with Les Hooper, Victor Feldman and George Benson over 
the years. But he's best known for his association with the Rippingtons, the 
electric instrumental band led by guitarist Russ Freeman. "I never had too much 
artistic say in the band," he said. "Russ liked the way I played his material, 
and I liked playing it." 
</P>
<P>
Though heard on the Rippingtons' latest recording, he hasn't appeared live with 
the group for well over a year. "I just felt that I wanted to spend more time 
doing my own thing," he said. "With the success that my own record (1988's "The 
Traveler") had, it was time to branch out. But I'm really thankful to have been 
involved with a group that allowed so many people to hear me." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Rippingtons, Fields' band is more democratic in its selection of 
material. "I want to be part of a band where everyone makes a contribution, a 
band that's more than just a reflection of my personality," he explained. "Even 
though I'm the motivating force behind the group, I also rely on everybody's 
input." The new band, with keyboardist Dave Goldblatt and bassist John Pena, 
will record Fields' fourth solo album sometime in January. Unlike "Other 
Places," which features singer Phil Perry on a pair of cuts, the new album will 
be all instrumental. "I want to represent most of what we do on the album live. 
There have been some songs that we really couldn't do live because I felt they 
weren't strong enough to perform without the singer. I've never been into 
having a singer on a gig," Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
The saxophonist likes the idea of being in jam-oriented sessions like the one 
Monday at El Matador. "I don't like to go on a gig and have to read a lot of 
music," he said. "It takes some of the enjoyment away, some of the spontaneity 
that can happen when you're playing standards. I'm looking forward to just 
going out and playing with these guys." 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Fields appears with Tony Guerrero and the Luther Hughes Trio on Monday 
night at 8:30 at El Matador restaurant, 16903 Algonquin Blvd., Huntington 
Beach. Cover charge is $35, including dinner; $20 for the show only. (714)

MORNING BRIEFING: NIGHTMARE GIVES MANLEY A REAL SCARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There are anti-drug messages, and then there are anti-drug messages. Defensive 
end Dexter Manley of the Phoenix Cardinals got one of the latter at 4 a.m. 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Manley, recently reinstated by NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue after a one-year 
suspension for flunking the league's drug test a third time, told the Arizona 
Republic that he'd dreamed he had a cocaine relapse. 
</P>
<P>
Said Manley: "That is the honest-to-God truth. I woke up and said, 'God, I'm in 
the hotel. God, I'm free.' It didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
By 6 a.m., Manley said, he was in the Cardinals' training complex, meeting with 
team counselor Gary Mack, who told him the dream probably was brought on by the 
frustration he has felt because of his limited playing time since being 
reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Add Manley: After two weeks of practice, he made his first appearance Dec. 9 
against Atlanta and was in the game for 19 plays. But against the New York 
Giants two weeks later, Manley was down to one play. 
</P>
<P>
Teammates said he paced the sideline, sometimes screaming obscenities. 
</P>
<P>
Said Manley: "I've never stood on the sideline that long. Never. Gary Mack 
saved me a couple of times. I got in a real tense way. There were times I 
wanted to choke (defensive coordinator) Joe Pascale. 
</P>
<P>
"If it hadn't been for (Mack), I'd have blown my cool. I don't think I'd be 
here. I'd have lost control." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Tonight's Freedom Bowl marks the second bowl appearance in 
Colorado State's history. On Jan. 1, 1949, the Rams lost, 21-20, in the Raisin 
Bowl at Fresno. Who won the game? 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely, positively: From Mike Littwin of the Baltimore Sun: "Which game 
gets to your house first -- the Domino's Pizza Copper Bowl or the Federal 
Express Orange Bowl?" 
</P>
<P>
Statue of limitations: Dennis Georgatos of the Associated Press pointed out 
that in the 1986 Cotton Bowl, Texas A&amp;M defeated Auburn and Heisman Trophy 
winner Bo Jackson, 36-16. In the 1987 Cotton Bowl, the Aggies defeated Notre 
Dame and Heisman winner Tim Brown, 35-10, and in a Southwest Conference game in 
1989, they defeated Houston and Heisman winner Andre Ware, 17-13. 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M's lone loss to a recent Heisman winner came in 1988, when 
Oklahoma State and Barry Sanders beat them, 52-15. 
</P>
<P>
And tonight? When Aggie Coach R.C. Slocum was asked about BYU's Heisman 
quarterback, Ty Detmer, he said: "I think he's got a little magic to him." 
</P>
<P>
Dirty air: When Rothmans, a British yacht entered in Australia's 
Sydney-to-Hobart race, crosses the finish line today, it will be met by 
anti-smoking protestors. 
</P>
<P>
The $11-million yacht, with the name of its tobacco sponsor written across the 
hull, has offended Australia's anti-smoking lobby, which won a major victory 
Friday when a ban on cigarette advertising in newspapers and magazines went 
into effect. 
</P>
<P>
Reuters reported that Dr. Bryan Walpole, state secretary of the Australian 
Medical Assn., which organized the demonstration, said Rothmans' sponsorship 
was "not in keeping with sailing's clean, fresh image." 
</P>
<P>
Under international racing rules, tobacco companies cannot be prevented from 
giving their names to yachts. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Occidental. 
</P>

Quotebook: Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe, listing Jim Valvano as one of 
his "17 reasons why college basketball is overrated": "Coach V is never 
responsible when he recruits scum and the young men act like scum. Coach V gets 
out of Dodge City before the sun goes down, and now gets paid $900,000 to tell 
us how great college basketball is." TED BROCK

HUSKIES TO USE FINLEY-DESIGNED BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles O. Finley, the controversial former owner of the Oakland A's, will have 
a part in the Rose Bowl game. Or rather, one of his footballs will. 
</P>
<P>
Finley was a frustrated guard on his high school football team in Gary, Ind., 
instead of a quarterback. The reason, he said: "My hand wasn't big enough to 
throw a football." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being covered with pebble-like grain the way conventional footballs 
are, Finley's ball has dimples -- inverted pimples -- making it feel more like 
a golf ball. 
</P>
<P>
When Washington is on offense, the Finley ball, called "Double Grip," will be 
in use. Iowa will use a conventional ball. College teams can use the ball of 
their choice on offense. 
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time the Huskies have used the Finley ball in a game. The 
ball did not receive accreditation from the NCAA Rules Committee until 
midseason, and only Michigan used it during the regular season. The Wolverines 
will use it on New Year's Day in the Gator Bowl against Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
"I sent Washington half a dozen balls to experiment with, and Tony Piro (Husky 
equipment manager) called and asked for 36 more," Finley said from his office 
in Chicago. "He told me that Mark Brunell took an instant liking to the ball. 
It has a better grip, so fellows like myself can throw it, and it goes farther 
and is more accurate. 
</P>
<P>
"Iowa decided against it. I sent them 10 balls about a month ago and got a call 
from their equipment man that they weren't interested." 
</P>
<P>
The Double Grip ball is being used in eight bowl games. Air Force used one 
Thursday night when it beat Ohio State in the Liberty Bowl at Memphis, Tenn.

GEORGIA TECH'S ROSS CURBING EMOTIONS

Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Ross is trying to play down the national championship 
implications of Tuesday's Florida Citrus Bowl game against Nebraska. If Georgia 
Tech should win and Colorado lose to Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl, the Yellow 
Jackets probably will be voted No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm certainly reminded enough that should we win, we would at least be in the 
hunt for the national championship," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think you can get too emotional too early, and we've still got five days 
to go. Besides, we're not really an emotional type of football team. My teams 
at Maryland were a lot more emotional than my teams here." 
</P>
<P>
Ross coached at Maryland for five years before coming to Georgia Tech four 
seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
If Colorado should win, some believe that the victory over Missouri, in which 
the Buffaloes scored on a fifth-down play, would taint their No. 1 ranking. 
However, Ross refuses to be brought into that controversy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not getting into the fifth-down controversy because in every game there is 
a time when an official misses a critical call," Ross said. "Obviously, this 
looks bad to the fans, but coaches see it every game. All I'm concerned about 
is beating Nebraska, and you're not going to bait me into anything about 
Colorado." JOHN CHERWA

IT'S MORE THAN A CONSOLATION GAME; 
</P>
<P>
FREEDOM BOWL: OREGON AND COLORADO STATE, UNLIKE PARTICIPANTS IN PAST YEARS, ARE 
GLAD TO BE IN ANAHEIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
After several years of serving a bowl of holiday leftovers, this year the 
Freedom Bowl offers something different. So what if Oregon and Colorado State 
aren't haute cuisine? At least these teams aren't the warmed-over remnants of 
seasons gone bad. 
</P>
<P>
No more teams such as Florida, which sold only 1,200 tickets before slogging 
through the final comedown of a disappointing season in last year's game. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Oregon and Colorado State are happy to be here, as both coaches and any 
third-string free safety seemed pleased to say this week, prompted or not. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon is making its bid for respectability by playing in consecutive bowl 
games for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming from the University of Oregon, it feels like back-to-back Super Bowls," 
said Michael McClellan, a senior flanker. 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks have built their 8-3 record on the arm of Bill Musgrave, who was the 
All-Pacific 10 quarterback, despite the attention devoted to others. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State is positively giddy over its first bowl game in 42 years, 
getting a sequel, at long last, to its 1949 Raisin Bowl appearance. It has 
taken only two years for Earle Bruce, the former Ohio State coach, to bring the 
Rams from 1-10 to 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
Is this game a comedown for a man who took the Buckeyes to two Rose Bowl games? 
Bruce, his ability proved once again, just smiles. 
</P>
<P>
"I've also been in the Peach, the Liberty, the Hall of Fame, the Fiesta," Bruce 
said. "I've been to the Citrus Bowl and the Tangerine. I can't say I haven't 
had all the experiences. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't feel any different. I think it's different for the kids. I've never 
coached a more appreciative football team than this. Sometimes in other 
programs, they don't appreciate it. They have been so receptive and worked so 
hard. We're not the most talented football team, but we have some talent." 
</P>
<P>
All this good feeling came by design, not happenstance, said Don Andersen, the 
game's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was important to have teams here that were anxious to be here," 
Andersen said, calling it "the game plan" to get teams from the Pac-10 and the 
Western Athletic Conference. "We didn't even go to the Big Ten, the SEC, Notre 
Dame. We took a very practical approach." 
</P>
<P>
Oregon is favored in this match, billed as a battle between the Ducks' passing 
offense, in which Musgrave has averaged 222 yards a game, and Colorado State's 
multiple-formation ground game. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon Coach Rich Brooks is encouraged that his offense will be stronger than 
it was in the final two games, when an injury-depleted unit failed to score a 
touchdown while losing to California, 28-3, and defeating Oregon State, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Musgrave has had time to recover from several injuries, the most recent of 
which kept him out of the last six quarters of the regular season with a bruise 
in his throwing shoulder. Two receivers are back after undergoing arthroscopic 
knee surgery, McClellan and Joe Reitzug. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, tailback Sean Burwell, a redshirt freshman who led the team with 949 
yards rushing after being forced into action because of an early-season injury 
to the starter, is back after missing most of the Oregon State game because of 
a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
"They're all healthy," Brooks said. "It makes me feel a little better about our 
chances on the offensive side since we struggled so much in the last two games 
of the year." 
</P>
<P>
The Ducks are not as sound on defense, where they lost senior Peter Brantley, 
an all-conference outside linebacker, because of a strained left knee suffered 
in practice last week in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State also has had time for an important player to heal. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Alford, a tailback who ran for 1,035 yards last season, has been bothered 
by a right hamstring pull and later by a strained tendon in his right foot. He 
rushed for 647 yards, but started only one game. The bulk of the ground work 
went to Brian Copeland and Todd Yert, a short-yardage fullback who has put his 
head down and bulled to 16 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Alford, there's a guy who hasn't been well all year," Bruce said. "He's going 
to see the football quite a bit -- if we get the football quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce keeps his own counsel as to which of two rotating quarterbacks he will 
start -- Mike Gimenez, the better option quarterback and the starter in the 
past five games, or Kevin Verdugo, the better passer, who was slowed by a 
shoulder injury late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Known to surprise even his assistants with his choice of a starter, Bruce 
strayed from an earlier expectation that Gimenez would start and said Friday, 
"I think probably (it would be) Verdugo, if we had to start right now." 
</P>
<P>
Defensively, Colorado State lost a starter in the secondary this week when 
Harlan Carroll came down with what was diagnosed as mononucleosis. That will 
put added pressure on a defensive backfield secondary already facing a great 
deal of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Musgrave throws the ball, and if you overdo (setting the defense for) that, 
they'll run the ball and put it in the end zone," Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon must be watchful of the curse of the favorite: overconfidence. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm obviously concerned that could be the case with our team," Brooks said. 
"There's no question Colorado State is challenged. Earle Bruce is challenged 
when he gets up in the morning. There's no question they'll be ready to play 
and come out and bloody our noses." 
</P>
<P>
Freedom Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
The kickoff is at 5 p.m. for the game, which will be on Channel 9 and the 
Raycom Sports Network. The game was televised by NBC last year. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon had sold 18,000 tickets as of Friday, and Colorado State had made 8,000 
of a total of 11,800 guaranteed sales by the Western Athletic Conference. An 
additional 10,000 tickets were sold by the Orange County Sports Assn., and 
another 10,000 have been given away for distribution to military families. 
About 3,000 in walkup sales are expected. The record for ticket sales is 
56,910, set in 1986 for the UCLA-Brigham Young game. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State Coach Earle Bruce was asked for his reaction to Air Force's 
upset of Ohio State, his former employer. Bruce beamed good-naturedly. "That's 
a good question. I've been waiting for that one. . . . Great coaching job by 
(Air Force Coach) Fisher DeBerry. That was a great win for us as a conference, 
a prestige win that shows the WAC is coming of age."

CLARK, TWO-TIME SECTION SCORING CHAMP, LEAVES ARIZONA 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing personal reasons and lack of sufficient playing time, freshman Tony 
Clark has quit the Arizona Wildcat basketball team, he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Clark plans on transferring to another school to play, but there aren't any 
schools he'd consider front-runners at this time. Last year, Clark narrowed his 
choices to San Diego State, Stanford, Notre Dame and Michigan before deciding 
on Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
"I do know that I need to make a decision fairly soon, before it gets too 
late," Clark said. "But right now, I'm just trying to figure out what to do, 
what's best for me and where the best place is to accomplishment that." 
</P>
<P>
Clark, the 6-foot-8, two-time San Diego Section scoring champion from Christian 
High, sat on the bench Sunday in Arizona's game against Providence. The last 
time he played was in a game against a semi-pro team a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
He came home for Christmas break and had several conversations with Arizona 
assistant coach Jessie Evans early in the week. Wednesday, he told Coach Lute 
Olson he had decided not to rejoin the team. Evans and Olson both tried to talk 
him out of his decision, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unbelievable," Clark said. "They all tried to talk me out of it. They 
told me my future was bright there, that they had become attached to me." 
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Friday afternoon, Clark said, "My regret stems not so 
much from the termination of association with the basketball program at a 
prestigious institute, but rather from the realization that I am leaving behind 
some valued friendships with teammates and members of the coaching staff." 
</P>
<P>
Painful back spasms caused Clark to miss most the preseason and Arizona's first 
two games. In his short tenure, Clark played 30 minutes in five games, scoring 
16 points and getting seven rebounds and one steal. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed that Tony has left the team," Olson said. "Tony's injury 
came at a crucial time and slowed his development. It was a problem which 
prevented him from being able to contribute more than he would otherwise have 
been capable of contributing to our team." 
</P>
<P>
Clark said the injury hurt his chances of playing more, but that he felt he had 
healed enough to his playing time increased. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt healthy enough (despite the injury) to have a chance to play more," 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Although he has left school, Clark technically still is a member of the team. 
He must make a request to the Wildcats for his release. 
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't asked for a request," said Cedric Dempsey, Arizona athletic 
director. "I haven't talked to Coach Olson about it." 
</P>
<P>
Dempsey said over the holidays it would take longer for the paperwork to go 
through once such a request is received. 
</P>
<P>
Art Clark, Tony's father, said they didn't know the steps required for his son 
to officially withdraw from the basketball program and from school. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to call the NCAA and see what the next step is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark has other options. Detroit made him the No. 2 draft pick in the June 4 
free agent baseball draft. But Clark said he won't quit school to pursue his 
baseball career just yet.

LONG BEACH TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
49ERS PLAY POOR HOSTS TO BROOKLYN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach discovered Friday night that there's nothing like a rout, 
even against a team that has lost 38 consecutive road games, to restore 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best I've felt about this team since the second week of practice," 
Long Beach Coach Seth Greenberg said after the 49ers broke a three-game losing 
streak by defeating Brooklyn College, 85-56, before 1,351 in the Long Beach 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard not to lose confidence when you get hammered," Greenberg said, 
referring to losses this month to Arizona and Syracuse, "but our kids are 
having a good time again." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, winning easily for the first time this season, improved to 3-5. 
Their previous victories, both unimpressive, were against Chicago State and Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
A good first half was all Long Beach needed. The 49ers erased a 12-10 deficit 
with 14 consecutive points to lead, 24-12, with 7:26 left in the half, and went 
on to a comfortable 43-21 lead at intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Lucious Harris, starting for the first time at point guard, scored six points 
during the 14-0 surge. 
</P>
<P>
Brooklyn, which has not won on the road since 1987, went six minutes without 
scoring and had only nine points in the last 13 minutes of the half. 
</P>
<P>
"We took them out of their offense," Greenberg said. "The first 18 minutes we 
played pretty good defense." 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen (4-7) had been giving up an average of 68 points. Not accustomed 
to the 49ers' fast-paced style, they made 26 turnovers and could get no closer 
than 20 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think they were a threat to get back in the game because they play so 
methodically," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Brooklyn Coach Ron Kestenbaum said, "We wanted to play a half-court game, they 
made it a full-court game. We were concerned with their quickness and athletic 
ability. We gave them too many second shots." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach had 27 offensive rebounds -- seven by Frankie Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, who had been shooting 39%, shot 44% for the game and 50% in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
"We were relaxed," Greenberg said. "We moved the ball better and got better 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
Harris made eight of 21 shots from the field but finished with a game-high 20 
points, four below his average. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Cutler added 13 points and Troy Joseph had 11. In reserve roles, Ronnie 
Winbush made three three-pointers and Chris Tower, a 6-foot-10 transfer from 
New Mexico, had seven points and four rebounds in his Long Beach debut. 
</P>
<P>
Brenton Birmingham led Brooklyn with 19 points.

BARRASSO, PENGUINS BEAT RED WINGS, 5-0

<P>
The Pittsburgh Penguins are not simply biding their time until the middle of 
next month when Mario Lemieux is expected to rejoin them. 
</P>
<P>
With the return to form of goaltender Tom Barrasso, they are climbing the 
Patrick Division standings. 
</P>
<P>
Until injuries slowed him a couple of years ago, Barrasso was the best 
goaltender in the NHL. He seems to be approaching that form. 
</P>
<P>
He stopped 27 shots Friday night at Pittsburgh in a 5-0 victory over the 
Detroit Red Wings for his first shutout in almost two years. It was also his 
sixth consecutive victory and gave the Penguins eight victories in the last 
nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 5, Chicago 0 -- Daren Puppa stopped 33 shots at Buffalo to gain his 
fourth career shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Vaive scored the only goal Puppa needed only 85 seconds after the opening 
faceoff. 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 5, Washington 3 -- Mike Richter gave up a goal on the 
Capitals' first shot at Landover, Md., then went on to beat them for the fourth 
time this season. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg 6, Boston 0 -- It was a night for shutouts. Bob Essensa stopped 31 
shots at Winnipeg as the Jets routed the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 5, Vancouver 2 -- At Vancouver, Esa Tikkanen scored twice in the 
Oilers' four-goal first period as they won their fourth consecutive game. DAN

CELTICS COOL OFF, GET BURNED IN ATLANTA BY HAWKS, 131-114 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just as the Boston Celtics appeared to be invincible, they fell back to earth 
with a thud. 
</P>
<P>
The improving Atlanta Hawks put together a one-two punch Friday night in 
Atlanta and ended the Celtics' eight-game winning streak with a 131-114 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Rivers scored 36 points and Dominique Wilkins added 31 as the Hawks, who 
lost 10 of their first 14 games, won for the 10th time in their last 13. The 
two were deadly, Rivers sinking 12 of 16 shots, Wilkins 11 of 16. Between them, 
they were seven for eight on three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, guards Reggie Lewis and Brian Shaw, who have led the Celtics' 
resurgence, were a combined six for 23. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the fifth loss in 28 games for the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
Boston was in the game for only the first quarter, trailing by four after 12 
minutes. By halftime, Atlanta led by 14, and it became a rout in the third 
quarter as the Hawks built their margin to 25 points. Midway through the final 
quarter, the Celtics trailed by 29. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 104, Sacramento 88 -- David Robinson's triple-double at San Antonio 
was a little different. He had 27 points, 13 rebounds and 11 blocked shots. 
Usually, a triple-double refers to points, rebounds and assists. In 35 minutes, 
Robinson had two assists. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 10th victory in the last 11 games for the Spurs. The Kings have lost 
five in a row, all by at least 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix 115, Philadelphia 96 -- Charles Barkley scored a season-high 45 points 
at Phoenix, but it wasn't nearly enough to save the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
The Suns, who are 7-2 since acquiring Xavier McDaniel from Seattle, were ahead 
from the outset, leading by as many as 14 points in the first half and pulling 
away again in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 97, Minnesota 85 -- After being fined $1,000 for his fight with 
Chicago's Horace Grant on Christmas Day, the Pistons' Joe Dumars didn't score 
in the first half at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
There wasn't much scoring by anybody, in fact, so when Dumars came through with 
21 points in the second half, the Pistons won handily. After 24 minutes of 
mainly inept play, the Timberwolves led, 35-32. 
</P>
<P>
Dumars was fined for throwing an elbow. Grant, who retaliated with a punch, was 
fined $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 101, New Jersey 99 -- On one of Akeem Olajuwon's off nights, the 
Rockets needed someone to come through with a big effort at East Rutherford, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Otis Thorpe had 21 points and grabbed a key rebound in the closing seconds to 
save the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Although Olajuwon was six for 17 and scored only 14 points, the Rockets led, 
90-75, with nine minutes left. The Nets' late rally barely fell short. DAN

WALTON GIVES HELIX VICTORY IN SPARTAN CLASSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Walton made two free throws with four seconds remaining to give Helix a 
63-62 victory over Chula Vista in the Spartan Classic at Chula Vista Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Helix (8-4) will play Redondo Union, which defeated Mira Mesa, 76-59, in 
tonight's championship at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Chula Vista was down by nine going into the fourth quarter but Jerome Green's 
three three-pointers helped the Spartans close the gap. With nine seconds 
remaining, Ken McDuffy made two free throws to put Chula Vista ahead, 62-61. 
</P>
<P>
After Walton's free throws the Spartans had the chance but just couldn't score. 
</P>
<P>
Helix was led by Lloyd Lake with 15 points. Derrick Henry and Jason Falconer 
each scored 11 points for the Highlanders. Henry also had seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Green led Chula Vista (6-6) with 19 points and Shane Howell added 16. Donnie 
Edwards led the Spartans with seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
In other Spartan Classic games: 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Union 76, Mira Mesa 59 -- Mira Mesa's Ryan Cunningham led all scorers 
with 31 points and 10 rebounds. Ronnie Grim's scored 30 points and had six 
rebounds for Redondo, which jumped to a 45-28 halftime lead. Mira Mesa dropped 
to 6-6.

TORREY PINES STRUGGLES PAST LINCOLN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GEIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Farrell, coach of the Torrey Pines basketball team and an organizer of the 
Above The Rim Hoopwear Classic, was talking about the $6 ticket price before 
the tournament began. 
</P>
<P>
He termed the price, "a steal, considering the caliber of the teams involved." 
</P>
<P>
But he couldn't have been talking about the San Diego teams present -- Torrey 
Pines, Lincoln and Valhalla -- not unless the ticket price included a free 
bottle of No-Doz. 
</P>
<P>
None of the three teams made it into the semifinals, which was not a surprise 
considering three of the top 15 teams in the country (according to USA Today 
rankings) were on hand. 
</P>
<P>
So the San Diego teams Friday played less than enthusiastically in consolation 
games -- that is, if Torrey Pines' 65-47 victory over Lincoln was any 
indication. 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets shot 27% from the field. Torrey Pines wasn't much better, making 
good on 37% of its shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons' John Allred, was four of 14 from the field, but finished with 14 
points to lead Torrey Pines. Chad Davis was four of six, including two of three 
from behind the three-point arc, and finished with 13. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's Hosa Baker led all scorers with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
It was Torrey Pines' second game of the day. Earlier, the Falcons shot 46% from 
the field, but lost, 69-66, to Payson (Utah). 
</P>
<P>
Craig Brown led the Falcons with 23 in that one. Payson's Bryan Nielson led all 
scorers with 24. 
</P>
<P>
In the semifinals: 
</P>
<P>
St. Raymond's 79, Monsignor McClancy 62 -- St. Raymond's advances to today's 
champioship game (8 p.m.) at Torrey Pines High School. It will play the winner 
of Friday's late game between No. 9 Jersey City (N.J.) St. Anthony's and No. 12 
Miami (Fla.) Senior. 
</P>
<P>
Four of St. Raymond's starters have been starting on the varsity since their 
sophomore year: forward Carl Greene, center Orlando Antigua and guards Emanuel 
Richardson and Terence Rencher. 
</P>
<P>
"And those four are Division I players," said Monsignor McClancy Coach Don 
Kent. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, Antigua has already committed to Pittsburgh and Rencher to Texas. 
The other two are being recruited by a number of schools. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Monsignor McClancy held tight by slowing the tempo in the first half and 
went into the locker room down by seven, 37-30. Impressive, considering St. 
Raymond's is ranked No. 2 in the nation by USA Today and Monsignor McClancy is 
unranked. 
</P>
<P>
But Antigua single-handedly put the game out of reach with 19 second half 
points, 11 rebounds and three steals. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Chaplin led Monsignor McClancy with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Camden 91, Las Vegas Bonanza 58 -- Camden shot 58% from the field and had five 
players in double figures, including Greg Barr and Art Crowder, both with 19, 
and Vernell Sturdivant and Keith Carmichael, both with 17. Barr also dealt 11 
assists and pulled down 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Deep Creek (Va.) 77, Valhalla 65 -- Greg Taylor finished with 30 points and 13 
rebounds to lead Deep Creek. Mark Dillon had 24 for Valhalla, and teammate Mike 
Nalu added 20.

AN ODYSSEY INTO THE GARDEN OF LEARNING;

<P>
WORDS ON FIRE: ONE WOMAN'S JOURNEY INTO THE SACRED; BY VANESSA OCHS HARCOURT 
BRACE JOVANOVICH $28.95, 328 PP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH BROYDE-SHARON, Filmmaker and journalist Sharon lived in Israel for 10 
years and now resides in Los Angeles. This summer she was called up to read the 
Torah, by a female rabbi of the Conservative movement. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is more desirable than forbidden fruit? Allowed the taste of every tree 
but the tree of knowledge, Eve -- as the story goes -- could not resist the 
temptation to sample the forbidden fruit and, as the story continues, she and 
her partner-in-crime, Adam, were summarily thrown out of Paradise. 
</P>
<P>
Though thousands of years have passed, the modern-day Eve, if she happens to be 
an Orthodox Jew and especially if she resides in Israel, is still an outcast, 
for the sacred texts of the Torah are forbidden to her. Author Vanessa Ochs 
spent a year in Israel and wrote "Words on Fire" to document her frustrations 
and indignation at the meager opportunities available for women who want to 
study the Torah in the original and in depth, as their male counterparts have 
been doing for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
"A Jew's understanding of the nature of God," Ochs writes, "of how to fulfill 
God's will, of how to behave and worship, of the past and future history of the 
universe are all contained in the Torah." She quotes from the Ethics of the 
Fathers, which enjoins men to "delve into the Torah and ... to continue to 
delve into it for everything is in it. 
</P>
<P>
But if Jews are called the people of the book, they mean men of the book, not 
women, she insists. 
</P>
<P>
An ardent feminist and a literature teacher, Ochs wanted, like the character in 
Isaac Bashevis Singer's "Yentl," not to be a man, but to touch and taste, hear 
and smell the sacred text that Jews have preserved and protected, loved and 
honored since time immemorial. 
</P>
<P>
Her title, "Words on Fire," comes from a quote from Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, 
who wrote at the turn of the 2nd Century: "The words of the Torah should be 
burnt rather than taught to women." 
</P>
<P>
For Jewish feminists, that is a call to battle. 
</P>
<P>
True, as Ochs points out, eight centuries later the great Torah scholar, 
Maimonides, elaborated upon this point and softened the interdiction, 
indicating that not all women's learning was forbidden -- certainly not oral 
Torah (the teaching and interpretations of the rabbis) -- only written Torah. 
</P>
<P>
In our own century, Rabbi Baruch Epstein has written: "Girls do not have 
intellectual ability and are therefore unable to make profound inquiries with a 
sharp mind and appreciate the depth of Torah. It is possible that by using 
their own minds, they will transgress the will of Torah." 
</P>
<P>
Ochs is outraged, as most modern women would be upon reading this. "The voices 
of these sages ... echo each other. They offend, humiliate and demean me," she 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
While her husband and children are busy with their studies in Israel, Ochs 
searches the history books for records of Orthodox Jewish women who ignored the 
prohibition and found ways to study the Torah and even become respected Torah 
scholars. There were so few, she discovers to her dismay, that they can be 
counted on one hand. 
</P>
<P>
So Ochs abandons the history books and begins a living search. She does indeed 
find some exceptional women who not only study from the sacred text but have 
launched study groups, seminars and schools to teach other women. 
</P>
<P>
Although the book begins slowly, unfolds gingerly, and at times suffers from a 
lack of momentum, as Ochs penetrates more deeply into the forbidden territories 
of learning her prose becomes more urgent, her voice more lyrical. 
</P>
<P>
In her personal odyssey to find these women, to learn the Torah from them, Ochs 
defines and refines her own identity as a woman, a Jew and a scholar. 
</P>
<P>
Must woman be exiled twice, first from the Garden of Eden and then from the 
garden of learning? One woman's journey into the sacred becomes every woman's 
search for equality and mastery.

SOVIET CHURCHES UNSURE OF COURSE AS NATION STRUGGLES FOR FREEDOM; 
</P>
<P>
EASTERN EUROPE: THE PEOPLE ARE EAGER FOR SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN, BUT THERE IS 
NO PRECEDENT FOR HOW RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS SHOULD ACT AND THINK IN THIS 
ENVIRONMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL CHANDLER, Chandler, a Times religion writer, is on leave to write a 
book about trends that will affect religion as the year 2000 approaches. He 
recently traveled to the Soviet Union and wrote this first-person account for 
the Religious News Service.

MOSCOW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The beefy young security guard, dressed in the standard Soviet military uniform 
of gray with red trim, stopped us at the entrance to the imposing Supreme 
Soviet building overlooking the Moscow River. We were there, I told him, to 
keep an appointment with Father Vyacheslav Polosin, chairman of the Supreme 
Soviet Committee on Freedom of Conscience, Religion, Philanthropy and Charity. 
Could he help us find him? 
</P>
<P>
The guard didn't know whether Polosin's office was there, or if the Russian 
Orthodox priest was in or out. He scowled and yelled officiously into two gray 
telephones on his desk -- neither had dials -- yet all the while he appeared 
genuinely concerned to make contact for my interview. 
</P>
<P>
After 10 minutes of alternately shouting, smiling, pacing and banging telephone 
receivers, the guard succeeded in piercing a typical maze of Soviet 
inefficiency and we were escorted into the sixth-floor office of the bearded, 
robed priest. There, we talked for more than an hour about the sweeping new 
religious liberty law that he had helped draft. 
</P>
<P>
This incident, falling on the final day of an intensive, three-week trip 
through the Soviet Union -- from the Baltic to the Black Sea and the Ukraine to 
the Kremlin -- struck me as an apt parable of a huge country in rapid and 
irreversible change. 
</P>
<P>
The blustery old-line authority is wavering while the new guard is trying to 
figure out who or what will replace it. At the same time that leaders are 
adjusting to glasnost and perestroika, inefficiency, scarce resources and a 
lack of motivation are crippling the country's efforts to stave off political 
chaos and economic collapse. 
</P>
<P>
And Soviet religion is caught in the middle in this new era of unprecedented 
freedom and opportunity, vulnerability and peril. There is simply no precedent 
for how the church should live and think in this environment. 
</P>
<P>
I found a certain naivete as well: 70 years of repression have left many 
Soviets with the belief that religious values, if only allowed to flourish, 
could now quickly instill moral leadership and install charitable services that 
communism has so dismally failed to provide. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, unsophisticated church leaders, with only rudimentary theology and a 
paucity of sound religious literature, are easy targets in a supermarket of 
spiritual beliefs and self-anointed messiahs now abroad in this vast land. 
</P>
<P>
As a first-time visitor to the Soviet Union, I shared what I suspect are the 
assumptions and preconceptions of many Americans. 
</P>
<P>
I knew that Russia is only one member, although the most populous one, of the 
still-intact 15-republic Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which stretches 
across 11 time zones and occupies one-seventh of the world's land mass. But I 
gained a firsthand appreciation of the country's immense size when our group 
spent long days and weary nights just to travel around the western fifth of it. 
</P>
<P>
I had read that this ancient culture, stemming from Babylonian times, consists 
of 130 cultural groups, 91 "major" languages and four alphabets. But I felt the 
fierceness of the ethnic and regional rivalries when Estonian Christians said 
they were insulted by being greeted in Russian, and pastors in the Ukraine 
insisted that they needed more Bibles -- but only in the Ukrainian language. 
</P>
<P>
I had been aware that shortages and long lines forced Soviet citizens to wait 
for food and household items. But the burden of the scarcity and poor quality 
became real to me when I talked to a woman in Tallinn, Estonia, who had been 
standing in line for three days waiting unsuccessfully for a basic sewing 
machine she had ordered months earlier. In a nearby bakery, people waited in 
longer and longer lines for fewer and fewer selections. The large picture of 
V.I. Lenin looking down from behind the empty shelves was "mocking the 
shoppers," our guide suggested. 
</P>
<P>
I had been prepared to expect corruption, but it was a surprise when an 
Aeroflot Airlines ticket agent brazenly told us that she could only get our 
translator aboard the crowded flight from Krasnodar to Moscow if we provided 
her boss with a carton of American cigarettes. And I wondered how the drivers 
stoically waiting in a long queue behind a "no petrol" sign must have felt when 
our Russian driver, armed with our U.S. dollars, zoomed ahead for a fill-up at 
the supposedly empty gas pump. 
</P>
<P>
I vividly remember the horror I felt in April, 1986, when I learned about the 
Chernobyl nuclear accident and the lethal radiation it spread. But I was taken 
aback to hear people from the affected area emotionally plead for medical help 
now, saying that the full extent of the damage has never been measured and that 
the government has done little for victims. I agonized with a pastor who feels 
he should remain there to minister, although three of his eight children are 
suffering radiation sickness while his wife has begged him to move away. 
</P>
<P>
I had written about the exodus of Soviet Jews seeking to emigrate to Israel, 
with 150,000 expected this year and up to 1 million in 1991. But I was shocked 
to hear firsthand about rising anti-Semitism in Leningrad at the same time that 
Jews have been able to establish new synagogues and open their first legal 
yeshiva. 
</P>
<P>
And I saw the ambivalence on the faces of a Baptist family and their friends in 
Maikop, near the Black Sea, at a farewell party the day before the family left 
for Sacramento. They had waited a year for emigration papers. Some who would 
also like to go conveyed more than a twinge of envy. The pastor showed the 
church's sorrow in losing its seventh member-family to the West, and the older 
generation expressed resignation that "there is little left for them here."

Like most Americans, I had watched the U.S. evening news detail the unraveling 
Soviet economy during the waning weeks of summer. I had read that "without a 
major revolution, the Soviet Union is spinning apart" and analysts' predictions 
that several republics will secede from the Soviet Union within two years.

But I was not expecting the mayor in the Ukrainian city of Rovno to tell us 
frankly and openly that "the economic system is totally dissolving and the base 
is totally gone... a system doomed to die." Yet, continued Ivan Josipovich, who 
had held his elected office as a non-communist a scant five months, "government 
structures are still in place. The old guard doesn't want to change a thing. 
They are still keeping the power in their hands and the heat on us."

Somehow, life goes on in the faltering republics in spite of terrible 
mismanagement, violence and cruelty. Most residents continue to live with 
remarkable patience and passivity. None that I talked to believes that 
religious freedom or perestroika can be turned back now. But many think that 
civil war, or at least severe civil disruption, is virtually inevitable.

In some ways, Marxism was a sincere attempt to right the injustices of a 
society in which the privileged and powerful plundered the masses. But because 
it is atheistic and subject to the same abuses is sought to correct, in my 
opinion it was bound to fail.

Now the fallout of new religious freedom has exposed the pent-up yearning for 
spirituality in the hearts of most of the Soviet people. They seem starved for 
morality, for integrity, for trustworthiness.

"A lot of people are believing now," said Vladimir, 17, a Russian Orthodox 
altar boy at a church whose members five years ago made a human chain around 
the building to keep state authorities from tearing it down.

"It's a remarkable time for the Gospel," said Johannes Reimer, a Russian 
"parachurch" pioneer and a leader at the first Soviet congress on 
evangelization, attended by 1,000 church leaders in Moscow Oct. 22-26. "There 
is a Russian spiritual soul that communism couldn't control. Communists don't 
believe in God, yet they sing an old Russian Orthodox song and they cry."

Can the current religious fervor empower a longing to recover a rich spiritual 
heritage that was abruptly truncated 70 years ago? And can Nobel Prize-winning 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose popularity is fast sinking in his fatherland, turn 
around a sprawling country racked by competing nationalistic tendencies and a 
technology that seems mostly time-frozen in the 1950s? 
</P>

Viktor Reimer, Johannes' brother and a co-founder of the Soviet Union, tempered 
his hope for a religious new day with the kind of bedrock realism, so prevalent 
here, which says that it all boils down to simple economics. "It's the length 
of the sausage," he said, "whether people have enough to eat."
