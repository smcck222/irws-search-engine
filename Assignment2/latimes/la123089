WILLIS CARSON, EX-REAL ESTATE PANEL CHIEF, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Willis E. Carson, 77, former president of the National Assn. of Real Estate 
Brokers and president of Carson Realty Co. in Inglewood, died Thursday in a 
convalescent home in Culver City. He had suffered a stroke earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Carson moved to the Los Angeles area from Texas during World War II and opened 
a realty office in Los Angeles. In 1949, he founded the Consolidated Realty 
Board, primarily for black realtors who then were excluded from other boards. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, he became president of the National Assn. of Real Estate Brokers and 
the next year was among 12 people appointed to the advisory committee of the 
Federal National Mortgage Assn. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Doris, a son, a daughter and six grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A funeral service will be held Thursday at 11:30 at Angelus Funeral Home in 
Southwest Los Angeles.

<P>
When the first annual Police and Fire Invitational Shoot-Out was scheduled, it 
seemed a bit unfair to have law enforcement types competing against personnel 
who stamp out blazes for a living. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, maybe not. Overall winner of the trap and skeet shoot-out in 
Redlands was the Long Beach Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
We don't know if that makes us feel good about the Fire Department or nervous 
about the police. 
</P>
<P>
Another contribution of the L.A. car culture: Owners of expensive jalopies can 
now install in their garages hydraulic platforms that will lift their treasures 
12 feet off the ground, presumably putting them out of reach of thieves. 
</P>
<P>
The inventor, Car Stacker West of Redondo Beach, charges about $4,500 to put 
one car in the air and about $8,500 for a double lift job. 
</P>
<P>
Think of the possibilities: With the car on the rack, you could change your own 
oil or rent a grease monkey. 
</P>
<P>
And you could brag about your new architectural style: Mark C. Bloome Moderne. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the purpose of the form, you can't really blame Wolcott's 
stationery store downtown for posting this announcement on its counter: 
</P>
<P>
"No bankruptcy kits sent out C.O.D. (cash on delivery) -- except to law firms." 
</P>
<P>
When we reported Friday that some local history buffs have formed the Millard 
Fillmore Bicentennial Commission to prepare for the 13th President's 200th 
birthday on Jan. 7, 2000, you might have been tempted to ask: 
</P>
<P>
But why should I care about Millard? 
</P>
<P>
Well, it was Fillmore who signed the bill admitting California as the 31st 
state on Sept. 9, 1850. There was, however, no celebration that day in L.A., 
which was then a dusty pueblo teeming with about 1,800 people (the exact count 
on any day depending on how many people had been killed at the gaming tables 
the previous night). 
</P>
<P>
In fact, news of statehood didn't reach L.A. for weeks because the town had no 
telegraph, railroad or fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about ingratitude: L.A. nearly left the state in the mid-1850s, writes 
author Midge Sherwood in her recently published "Days of Vintage, Years of 
Vision." 
</P>
<P>
At the urging of the southern counties, who felt they paid an unfair burden of 
the taxes, a bill was introduced into the state Assembly that would have 
divided California into three states: Shasta (the northern portion), California 
(the central), and Colorado (the southern, including L.A.). 
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved by the Assembly but died in the state Senate. Had it 
passed, USC would be the University of Central Colorado today. An oft-used 
expression would be: "It never rains in Colorado. . . ." And singer John Denver 
no doubt would have been inspired to write "San Gabriel Mountain High." 
</P>
<P>
Did anyone get the license number of that mattress? 
</P>
<P>
Sonia Duran of Long Beach was directing traffic while her company's float -- a 
bed -- was being wheeled into position for the funky Belmont Shore Christmas 
Parade. But someone lost control of the bed and it crashed into her, spraining 
her ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Said Duran: "My doctor told me, 'I've heard about people falling out of bed, 
but never someone getting run over by a bed.' " 
</P>
<P>
Did anyone get the license number of that fireball? 
</P>
<P>
Still no word on the identity of the large, greenish mass that flashed across 
the sky Thursday night and prompted hundreds of calls from residents and 
pilots. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a missing aircraft, said Federal Aviation Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't a spacecraft, the North American Air Defense Space Command said. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't indigestion, doctors interviewed by The Times agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, museum guide Rick de la Cruz of the Griffith Park Observatory didn't 
seem worried about this ambiguous omen for the new decade. He said the 
phenomenon prompted about 10 calls. 
</P>
<P>
An unusual number? 
</P>
<P>
"We get hundreds of calls more about our Laserium shows," he added. 
</P>
<P>
KNX radio's Tom Sirmons predicts that the complaint of the '90s mother to her 
grown children will be: 
</P>
<P>
"You don't write, you don't call, you don't fax. . . ."

2 LAPD OFFICERS WORK AS A TEAM TO SAVE A BABY'S LIFE 
</P>

Two Los Angeles police officers, flagged down by frantic parents as the 
officers left the scene of a drive-by shooting, resuscitated a 3-week-old girl 
who had stopped breathing and rushed her to a hospital, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Officers Dale Best and Patty McComb had just finished aiding homicide 
investigators Thursday at the scene of the fatal shooting of Juan Carlos 
Gonzalez in Mar Vista when the parents of the unidentified infant rushed over 
to them and told them their child had stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
"They were hysterical," Best said of the couple who stopped him near the scene 
of the shooting at 4850 Marianwood Drive. "The woman was standing out there in 
her nightgown screaming. We put them both in the car and turned on the siren." 
</P>
<P>
While Best drove the infant and the parents to Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital 
in a squad car, McComb cleared the baby's throat and nose and resuscitated her. 
</P>
<P>
"The baby just had a severe cold," said Best, 46, of the Pacific Division. "But 
had somebody not known how to clean its mouth out, it would have probably 
died." 
</P>
<P>
A Daniel Freeman spokesman said the infant, whose parents were not identified, 
was treated for the cold and breathing difficulties and was transferred to 
Santa Monica Hospital early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Best, who on Friday celebrated his 21st anniversary as a police officer, said 
his captain had suggested honoring the officers for saving the infant's life. 
</P>
<P>
"That's nice, but it just felt darn good to be out there," Best said. "This 
kid, this tiny infant wasn't breathing. It puts a wet spot in the corner of 
your eye." 
</P>
<P>
Best said Friday also marked the last day McComb would spend as his partner. 
</P>
<P>
"She's going back to (the Police) Academy to finish her training," he said. 
"What a way to spend your last night." 
</P>
<P>
Best credited his temporary partner with actually saving the baby. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just a cab driver," he said. "She did all of the work. Luckily, she had 
bothered to learn how to resuscitate people." 
</P>
<P>
The West Bureau CRASH anti-gang unit is investigating the drive-by shooting. 
Police said there have been no arrests in the incident.

TV NEWS: IF THE '80S RETROSPECTIVES TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY, STAY TUNED -- FOR 
THE MILENNIUM.

<TEXT>
<P>
I looked up from my coffee and newspaper the other morning and noticed that 
television's recap of the last decade was in full stride. There rolling across 
the screen from the "Today" program were rapidly changing images from the 1980s 
-- Nancy Reagan dressed in red as her husband takes the oath of office, smoke 
spiraling from the Challenger, a homeless man dragging a torn blanket. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as I started to think about the man with the torn blanket, his image was 
supplanted by another -- Secret Service men crouching over someone on the 
ground. Oh, yes, I recalled; that was when President Reagan was shot. In the 
time it took me to have that thought, pictures from two other events flashed on 
the screen without my registering what they were. This weekend, we will 
continue to be inundated with quick-cut pastiches of events, not just from the 
last year but from the entire decade -- Michael Dukakis riding in a tank, a 
woman freebasing, a finger tracing a name engraved on the Vietnam Memorial -- 
and some eager beavers, in print as well as broadcast, are starting to recall 
the millennium. Probably rapid retrospectives of the bi-millennium -- a Babe in 
a manger, the rock from which Mohammad ascended to heaven -- are not far 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
To study history is a joy. That is why anyone who loves history must find 
television's treatment of it jarring, to say the least. By their very nature, 
telescoped images -- George Bush stroking a White House puppy, Israeli soldiers 
firing tear gas at Palestinians -- foreclose reflection. They feed the eyes but 
starve the mind. Over time, they tend to numb us and eventually alienate us 
from the political process. 
</P>
<P>
In their whirling speed and lack of context -- blood pouring from a black man's 
head in South Africa, Geraldine Ferraro jubilantly raising her arms from the 
podium of the 1984 Democratic Convention -- these quick-cut images reduce human 
experience to spectacle. Spectacle discourages response. It can titillate, but 
not teach. It can excite, but not empower. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Jefferson's thought about a free press was that citizens needed 
information if they were to act on their own behalf. Today we are overwhelmed 
by information, but in a form that tends to turn us into audiences rather than 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
It's not the technology that is at fault. Bill Moyers sits and talks with one 
person about his or her ideas for as long as an hour at a time. Mr. Rogers 
still speaks quietly and slowly to children about their interests and fears. 
MacNeil and Lehrer dare to give us daily discussions of the news instead of 
just videotaped capsules. 
</P>
<P>
These examples, of course, come from public television. The tendency in 
commerical television is to speed up. The idea is to snatch the attention of 
the viewer who, remote control in hand, "grazes" through the competing 
channels. Advertisers attempt to do this with vertigo-producing commercials 
that flip through images in milliseconds. This reductionism applies to 
news-related programming as well. A researcher at Harvard's Joan Shorenstein 
Barone Center recently found that the average network "sound bite" from 
presidential campaigns dropped from 42.3 seconds in 1968 to 9.8 seconds last 
year. Even the few commercial interview programs such as "Nightline" and the 
morning talk shows have a hurried, anxious tone as interviewers interrupt the 
speakers to inform them that "we're out of time." 
</P>
<P>
Television can give us so much, except the time to think. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that the best way to comprehend the events of this extraordinary year 
-- a solitary Chinese man standing in front of a tank, demonstrators dancing on 
the Berlin Wall, American helicopters swooping in formation over a Panamanian 
beach -- is to turn off the television set.

Your article on Marianthi Lansdale outraged me. Is she saying it's okay to lie? 
What a terrible example she represents for the young people of this country. To 
make matters worse, Chancellor Reynolds appears to condone such behavior. What 
is happening to the values of our society?

In reference to the editorial, "Creationists Should Give It A Rest," Dec. 16, 
the author states "These recurrent and narrow efforts to foist a particular 
religious view . . . " 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me that by only teaching one theory in the schools and never 
mentioning that there are others and what they are is by far the more narrow 
view.

The U.S. action against Noriega has provided yet another illustatrion of the

commentators and reporters who severely criticized the Administration for not 
taking more decisive action at the time of the attempted coup now exhaust every 
possible extreme to discredit the positive action taken.

The Times article does not give a balanced portrayal of the chairwoman of the 
California State University Board of Trustees, Marianthi Lansdale. I have been 
a member of the board since 1974 and served as board chair from 1979-1981. I 
was one of Lansdale's fellow trustees who elected her to board vice- chair in 
1987-88, to chairwoman in 1988-89 and for a second term in 1989-90. Clearly, I 
and my fellow board members have admired her leadership skills and commitment 
to the university. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale has been an ardent supporter of child care services for student 
parents in the CSU system and advocated equity and access to higher education 
by single parents, ethnic minorities and others who traditionally have not had 
an opportunity to attend college. She has worked hard on achieving better 
fiscal support for CSU, including salary and research support. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdale is an active supporter of the fine arts and has given generously of 
her time and resources to California higher education. She brings to our board 
energy, wit, enthusiasm and dedication.

<P>
It is heartening to discover that our policy-makers have yielded to popular 
opinion in matters of foreign policy. The invasion of the sovereign nation of 
Panama to oust a dictator who stands accused of being an all around bad guy is 
an indication that vigilante justice still lives. This could be the beginning 
of an encouraging trend whereby protection under the law is denied anyone 
suspected or accused of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
This new approach will considerably aid in the declared war on drugs because we 
can take out anybody who probably deals in drugs without the lengthy and 
expensive inconvenience of allowing them their day in court to confront their 
accusers.

In your editorial "Creationists Should Give It a Rest," " 'creation science,' 
or the biblical interpretation of human origin . . . " (emphasis mine). As a 
professor of composition and of The Bible as Literature, may I suggest you 
change the article the to a or, even more precisely, use the possessive their? 
As you are certainly aware, other believers in the Bible do not agree with 
so-called "creation science." By casually using the definitive article the, you 
imply that there is only one biblical interpretation and thereby strengthen 
such an absurd position.

DEFENSE CUTS, 'PEACE DIVIDEND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's very difficult to muster much sympathy for the "victims" of the massive 
spending cuts that will inevitably have to take place in the defense industry 
over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
While the arms makers to the world were busy engorging themselves at the public 
trough over the last two generations, the number of environmental and social 
disasters that could have been diverted by a sensible and just allocation of 
public monies continued to escalate. You can largely blame the rapacious greed 
of the defense industry and the cupidity of the politicians it bought for the 
creation and maintenance of the Cold War -- along with a stifling of the 
national creativity and commitment to true democracy that were supposedly our 
twin hallmarks, not to mention the perpetration of monstrous social injustices 
at the hands of "banana-republic" dictators supported with U.S. tax dollars 
throughout the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
While the massive wallet-hoovering of the American people was taking place 
during the Reagan reign, we collectively turned our backs on the needs of our 
own permanent underclass -- the increasingly poor women, children, and 
minorities who where systematically kept standing in the shadows while Reagan 
and his cronies crowed about it being "morning in America" once again. The 
not-so-benign neglect that the Republicans in general and Reagan in particular 
foisted on this underclass has resulted in an increasingly drug-ridden, 
illiterate and culturally anarchic country. 
</P>
<P>
May the 90s see the demise of the arrogance characteristic of the 80s and 
America's own version of perestroika, something we so desperately need.

<P>
The widespread international castigation of the American intervention in 
Panama, particularly by Libya, the Soviet Union, and neighboring Central and 
South American countries, is unadulterated hogwash. 
</P>
<P>
It is analogous to condemning the police for storming a house wherein a

The republic of Panama is a Frankenstein's monster that the United States 
created in 1903 by aiding in its secession from Colombia, and the Canal is our 
"baby" -- a product of American ingenuity and determination. Far from 
interfering in the internal affairs of another nation, we are merely 
safeguarding our own crucial interests, and assuring that the Panama Canal will 
remain open to inter-ocean traffic from all the countries of the world.

When Tommy Lasorda was confronted with the strikeout record of their new 
acquisition, Juan Samuel, he said, "We will help him make the necessary 
adjustments in that, too." If they can do that for Samuel, how come they never 
made the necessary adjustments for John Shelby?

"Betting With Poor Bob?" 
</P>
<P>
Or, maybe "Betting Poor With Bob" might be a more appropriate title now that he 
has failed (miserably) to help the poor readers/bettors. 
</P>
<P>
Bob's results show that it is not only difficult to win at betting horses, but 
also that his manner of betting leaves something to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
He was constantly going out on a limb, so to speak, with triples and parlays. A 
more conservative method might be a better approach. 
</P>
<P>
First, I think he should be wagering real cash, either his own or the paper's 
money. And second, he should not be required to bet every day. Only when he 
wants to. The "profits" could go to the "homeless," poor Bob, or some other 
charity at the end of the season.

Here we go again. The Times' photo of Charles White's "phantom" touchdown in 
the 1979 Rose Bowl is sure to stir up controversy.

Why don't we give a slide of the picture and a light table to a team of Times

I'm sure they'll come to three conclusions: It really was a touchdown, we are

George Allen is teaching something that the Los Angeles Times will never

teaches the most valuable lesson a person will ever learn: In every "skid row

FULLERTON GETS WELL BY DOWNING MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE, 77-69 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CASPER, Wyo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the time Cal State Fullerton made it to Wyoming's wide-open spaces, the 
Titans were a sick-and-tired team. 
</P>
<P>
They were sick with all manner of ailments. And they were tired, not only from 
their 13-hour trip from Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
They also were tired of losing, after ruining their 5-0 start with a 29-point 
loss to Colorado State and a 12-point loss to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Sneed, still ailing from the flu, was worried. 
</P>
<P>
"They say a team is a reflection of its coach," Sneed said before the Titans 
played Middle Tennessee State in the first round of the Cowboy Shootout. "If 
they play like I feel, we're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Titans' 77-69 victory over the Blue Raiders in the Casper Events 
Center Friday night proved just the tonic. 
</P>
<P>
"For the moment, a win makes everyone on the team feel better," Sneed said 
after the Titans dispatched Middle Tennessee State. Fullerton took a 15-2 lead 
at the outset and never trailing, although the Blue Raiders made several runs. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's balance had seemed dangerously close to coming undone the night 
before, at a practice at which leading scorer Cedric Ceballos took an elbow to 
the eye that opened a cut requiring stitches. 
</P>
<P>
At the same practice, reserve Ron Caldwell and Sneed had verbal exchanges that 
resulted in Caldwell being on the bench in street clothes Friday. And starting 
center John Sykes, who practiced sparingly, realized he wouldn't be able to 
start because his eyes remain red, irritated by a reaction to eyedrops. 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton pulled it together against Middle Tennessee State, a team that 
has played in a postseason tournament in each of the past five years, but is 
off to a 4-4 start with a young team this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been in a rut," Sneed said. "We've had three or four bad practices, 
whether it was the flu, injuries or internal things with a couple of players. 
There's nothing like a win to get you hugging in the locker room again. It was 
a good win on the road, against a good team and a quality coach." 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos is making a habit of strong second-half performances. He had three 
points at halftime, making one of only four field goal attempts. But he 
finished with 22 points and 16 rebounds, 11 of them in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Sneed said Ceballos' apparent penchant for the second half is partly a result 
of the extra attention other teams pay him. 
</P>
<P>
"Cedric is a marked man," Sneed said. "He's had a lot of national attention, 
and probably the most important thing the other coach is talking about is how 
to stop Cedric." 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos, who at times has endured very poor halves as he tried to find his 
shooting touch, said he was more patient against Middle Tennessee State. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually I just keep putting it up," he said. "But it was time to relax and let 
it come slowly. It's just a slump I'm trying to get off my back. When the shots 
aren't dropping, I just try to rebound and take my shots closer in to the 
basket. You can't really have a slump when you're shooting layups." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Hill, who scored 19 for Fullerton, has been picking up the slack for 
Ceballos, averaging 23 points over the past five games and leading the Titans 
in scoring in the last four before Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying basically to complement each other," Hill said. "If one's not 
doing the job, the other one tries to bring him out." 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Williams added 13 for Fullerton. Agee Ward scored eight, and senior 
center David Moody, playing in place of Sykes and Aaron Wilhite, who had foul 
trouble, scored seven points, playing his best game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Middle Tennessee State never let Fullerton turn the game into a blowout though, 
trimming the lead to as few as three points and trailing by just seven with 
1:25 left. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton will meet Wyoming (6-4), a 73-66 winner over Northeast Louisiana, in 
the tournament championship game tonight at 8. 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Sneed says Ron Caldwell will dress for tonight's game and will be 
permitted to play. Caldwell was held out Friday for disciplinary reasons. . . . 
Cedric Ceballos' 16 rebounds against Middle Tennessee State was the 
second-highest total of his college career. He had 20 against San Jose State 
last season.

STEWART GIVES BREA A RETURN TO THE FINAL

Brea-Olinda High School point guard Rodney Stewart made the most of his second 
chance Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart sent his team into overtime by missing the front end of a one-and-one 
late in regulation. But he drilled an 18-foot jumper with a second left in 
overtime to give Brea a 64-63 victory over St. John Bosco in a championship 
semifinal of Brea's tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Brea (10-3) will meet Compton (13-2), in the championship game at 8:30 tonight. 
It will be Brea's fifth consecutive trip to the final. 
</P>
<P>
St. John Bosco Coach Tim Haley must have had a scouting report on Stewart, who 
had missed the front ends of a pair of one-and-ones in the final minute 
Thursday night in Brea's victory over Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
Haley had his team foul Stewart in the backcourt with 45 seconds left in 
regulation and St. John Bosco trailing, 57-54. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart's free throw clanked off the rim and St. John Bosco's Bob Mendoza 
grabbed the rebound. With 10 seconds left, Mario Saucedo hit a three-pointer 
from the baseline to force overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The teams traded leads in overtime until St. John Bosco center Fidencio Saldana 
put in a follow shot to give the Braves (6-8) a 63-62 lead with 12 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
On Brea's final possession, Stewart looked to get the ball to leading scorer 
Keith Walker, but he was double-teamed. So Stewart, who finished with nine 
points, got free just inside the three-point line and hit the winning jump shot 
with a second left. 
</P>
<P>
St. John Bosco point guard Dashon Quiette made six three-pointers to lead his 
team with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
Walker led all scorers with 32 points, but was held to just five after the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Sunny Hills 57, Buena Park 54 -- Buena Park forward Jamal Collins led all 
scorers with 19 points. Sunny Hills was led by Dominic Carnesi's 16 and Kenny 
Overby's 14. 
</P>
<P>
El Modena 64, Sonora 52 -- Guard Greg Gottlieb of El Modena led all scorers 
with 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
Bakersfield Foothill 57, La Habra 35 -- Foothill was led by Kenzi Smith and 
Fuzzy Robinson with 12 points apiece. 
</P>
<P>
El Dorado 73, Whittier Christian 72 (OT) -- El Dorado guard Mike Bradach was 
the game's leading scorer with 26 points, including a pair of three-pointers.

ABT, JOFFREY AND THE STATE OF DANCE THEATER IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having read "ABT Cancels L.A. Dates; Frozen Out by Joffrey?" (by Lewis Segal, 
Dec. 20), I feel compelled to, if not set the record straight, at least clarify 
it as to the role of the Music Center Operating Co. 
</P>
<P>
The Operating Co. administers the Music Center Complex pursuant to a sublease 
from the County of Los Angeles. The charge given to the Operating Co. is to 
operate the center so that the citizens of the county shall have the benefit of 
a wide array of the finest "performances essential to the educational and 
cultural development of the community." 
</P>
<P>
For 25 years the Operating Co. has faithfully undertaken that responsibility 
without succumbing to any pressure or influence of the interests of any group, 
and will continue to do so for the next 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
CHARLES I. SCHNEIDER, Chairman of the Board, Music Center Operating Co., Los 
Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Segal's article quoted an executive of American Ballet Theatre as saying that 
despite an earlier announcement of a July engagement, the company will not 
dance in Los Angeles in 1990. Sources were quoted as saying the American Ballet 
Theatre decision came after collapse of negotiations with the Music Center 
Operating Co.

FACES. . .: FINDING THE UPSIDE

<P>
Those corporate fiends in marketing? John Getz doesn't think they're so 
fiendish. 
</P>
<P>
"I know these guys," says the actor, who is playing one such specimen in 
Richard Dresser's comedy "The Downside" at Pasadena Playhouse. "When I moved to 
New York, I met a group of people who worked in the marketing department of a 
major corporation. They're terrific people, whom I still care for. You have to 
understand: It's another reality. Lying about things . . . but with a grain of 
truth. And pretty soon you start to believe it yourself." 
</P>
<P>
And acting? "Acting isn't about lying, but discovering truths," he says. Beyond 
that, however, there are some moral parallels: "As an actor, you're presented 
with the opportunity of making a helluva lot of money to do something 
despicable. Have I? Sure! Not something with which I politically disgree. But 
certainly trash. It may not be really harmful, but it does add to the general 
pollution of ideas in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Happily for Getz, who is married to writer Grace McKeaney and the father of 
9-month-old Hannah, "Downside" is not that. Nor is "M. Butterfly," in which he 
served eight months last year on Broadway. Nor is "Born on the Fourth of July," 
in which he genially refers to himself as "one of the 130 actors in the movie." 
</P>
<P>
Except for his clean-cut cop in the series "Rafferty and MacGruder" and 
cuckholded husband in "Thief of Hearts," there have been a lot of bad guys 
lurking behind the handsome face -- like his inept murderer in "Blood Simple" 
and jealous suitor in "The Fly." And this week, he will go in front of the 
cameras to wrap Emilio Estevez's "Men at Work." Admits Getz of that movie 
character, "I'm somewhat less than reprehensible. A nasty piece of work."

As the 28-year-old father of twin boys, I am outraged at the promotion trailer 
for Chevy Chase's "Christmas Vacation." What is wrong with critics who by 
praising the film seem to be condoning a family pet being electrocuted? 
</P>
<P>
Where was the SPCA when such a disgusting scene was even being considered for 
filming? Probably taking another coffee break.

FACES. . .: ART FROM HER ROOTS

<P>
Performance artist and painter May Sun has relatives high in the Chinese 
government. That did not stop her parents from taking their children and their 
"vacation" visas and fleeing to Hong Kong when the artist was 2. "We came to 
the U.S. from Hong Kong when I was 16," she says. "I matured in both cultures, 
and I can finally say I'm equally comfortable in both." 
</P>
<P>
Sun first returned to China in 1985. "It was a wonderful, uplifting experience. 
In small, serene towns willows covered the landscape. In Beijing, youngsters 
and old grannies really did gather in parks to do Tai Chi and you could stroll 
through the city safely at any time of night." 
</P>
<P>
After her return Sun did several performance pieces dealing with China -- "The 
Great Wall: How Red Is My China?" and most recently, "L.A. River, Chinatown," 
an impressive history of the Chinese in Los Angeles recounted like a haunting 
verse and staged in tents. 
</P>
<P>
Her trip also inspired such graphic works as a double portrait of Chairman Mao 
and Colonel Sanders called "Democracy: It's Finger Lickin Good." "Kentucky 
Fried Chicken was the first fast food in China and the place was built directly 
across the street from Mao's tomb. I was struck by the idea of Mao watching all 
this develop." 
</P>
<P>
Any ironic humor found in China's opening cultural doors turned to horror as 
those doors slammed shut. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt very sad, like something hopeful was snatched away," she says. Her 
Chairman Mao-Colonel Sanders piece is on view through Jan. 15 on a bulletin 
board at Ventura Boulevard and Woodley Avenue in Van Nuys, one of three 
bulletin boards by artists put up by Patrick Media Group and Los Angeles 
Contemporary Exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
"I reworked the old portraits of Mao and Colonel Sanders by adding hand-colored 
Newsweek photos of cheering demonstrators framed in blood red paint. As I 
changed the pieces, Chairman Mao began looking more and more sinister." MARLENA

Television toasts New Year's Eve and the dawn of a new decade with a minimum of 
noise and a maximum of merriment Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
At 11:30 p.m. Sunday, the late-night revelry abounds in a three-way 
free-for-all. 
</P>
<P>
"Happy New Year America -- 1990," a CBS broadcast airing on (2)(8), features 
blowouts at the Waldorf-Astoria and Times Square in New York as well as Billy 
Bob's honky-tonk in Ft. Worth, Tex. Hosted by Natalie Cole, the two-hour show's 
performers include Melissa Manchester, Tanya Tucker, Charlie Daniels and Gary 
Morris. 
</P>
<P>
ABC counters with "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve '90" on (7)(3)(10)(42). 
Braving the cold of Manhattan, Clark ticks off the final seconds of 1989 at his 
customary post in wild 'n' crazy Times Square. Back in Hollywood, Kirk Cameron 
and Lori Laughlin co-host an in-studio bash with pop music stars Michael 
Damian, Expose, Martika, Stephanie Mills and the Temptations. 
</P>
<P>
On KNBC-TV Channel 4, weathermen Fritz Coleman and Mark Thompson collaborate on 
"New Year's Live: West Coast Countdown," a survey of celebrations taking place 
in Santa Monica, Oakland, San Jose, Seattle and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The sole New Year's Eve program with a classical ring will play on PBS. Carl 
Orff's "Carmina Burana" is performed by soprano Kathleen Battle, tenor Frank 
Lopardo, the Shinyukai Choir and the Berlin Philharmonic, conducted by Seiji 
Ozawa. The 90-minute telecast begins Sunday at 10 p.m. (Channels 15, 24), 11 
p.m. (50) and midnight on KCET Channel 28. 
</P>
<P>
On cable, the rockin' lasts into the wee hours (11 p.m.-2 a.m.) as MTV greets 
the New Year with performances by Richard Marx, Living Colour, Neneh Cherry, 
B-52's, Young M.C. and Lenny Kravitz. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, Ann Jillian and Clifton Davis emcee the traditional "King 
Orange Jamboree Parade" from Miami at 7 p.m. (4)(36)(39). 
</P>
<P>
And returning tonight for its 10th year, the "Lou Rawls Parade of Stars" raises 
money for the United Negro College Fund on cable's WGN (5-7 p.m., 7:30 
p.m.-midnight); Channel 13 (6 p.m.-1 a.m.) and Channel 10 in San Diego (6-11 
p.m., 11:30 p.m.-1:30 a.m.). It's hosted here by Marilyn McCoo and Alex Trebek, 
with Nancy Wilson and Ed McMahon sharing the honors in Las Vegas. STEVE LINAN

What could be more appropriate to end a decade that has seen more televised 
football than any other than a weekend with almost round-the-clock football? 
</P>
<P>
There are seven games this weekend, five college bowls and two National 
Football League playoff contests, not counting another seven bowl games New 
Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Today's schedule begins with the John Hancock Bowl between No. 16 Texas A&amp;M 
and No. 23 Pittsburgh at 9:30 a.m. on Channels 2 and 8. This game has gone 
through a metamorphosis through the decade as corporate sponsorship has taken 
more control over sports. 
</P>
<P>
From 1936-85, the El Paso, Tex.-based game was known as the Sun Bowl. In 1986, 
it became the John Hancock Sun Bowl. However, because nearly all the media 
continued to refer to it as the Sun Bowl, the game's name was changed again in 
June to ensure mention of the corporate sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Bowl matching Washington and Florida follows at 11 a.m. today on 
Channels 4, 36 and 39. When only 30,365 tickets were sold for Freedom Bowl I in 
1984, some felt that the first Freedom Bowl would also be the last. But the 
Anaheim Stadium-based contest survived, and has grown to get its own 
major-network television contract. 
</P>
<P>
In today's other bowl action, Georgia meets Syracuse in the Peach Bowl at 11:30 
a.m. on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42, while ESPN carries the Gator Bowl match-up 
between No. 14 Clemson and No. 17 West Virginia at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The football decade, which began with the Cotton Bowl and Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1, 
1980, concludes with the inaugural Copper Bowl in Tucson, pitting Arizona 
against North Carolina State at 5 p.m. Sunday on TBS. 
</P>
<P>
In pro football Sunday, the Rams begin their long-shot hopes for Super Bowl 
XXIV against the Philadelphia Eagles in the National Football Conference wild 
card playoff game at 9:30 a.m. on Channels 2 and 8. (When the decade began, 
Rams Coach John Robinson was saying he'd be staying at USC until at least 1984. 
He left USC for the Rams after the 1982 season.) 
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's other NFL game, the Houston Oilers play host to the Pittsburgh 
Steelers in the American Football Conference wild card playoff game at 1 p.m. 
on Channels 4, 36 and 39. 
</P>
<P>
In non-football action, both Philadelphia winter professional teams pay visits 
to Los Angeles tonight. The Philadelphia Flyers have a 7:30 p.m. Prime Ticket 
date against the Kings at the sold-out Forum. At the same time, the 
Philadelphia 76ers, no longer a bad team, go against the Clippers on 
SportsChannel. STEVEN HERBERT

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No local survey on the question exists, but the most frequent religion 
newsmaker in Southern California during 1989 was Roman Catholic Archbishop 
Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony, 53, was in the news throughout the year -- from the disclosure in 
February of a $395,000 jet helicopter donated for his use in the three-county 
archdiocese to his leadership role in a statement on AIDS that criticized 
condoms. The statement eventually was approved by the U.S. Catholic bishops in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
Although in the news much less than Mahony over the course of the year, San 
Diego Bishop Leo T. Maher took on a high media profile late in 1989. Maher set 
off a storm of reaction by barring a Catholic parishioner, Democrat 
Assemblywoman Lucy Killea, from Communion in the midst of her campaign for a 
state Senate seat because of her pro-choice position on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Some political analysts -- and Killea's opponent -- said Maher's action might 
have, due to the publicity it generated, mobilized pro-choice forces and 
contributed to her election. 
</P>
<P>
In what was a precursor to Maher's action, Mahony stirred criticism on June 1 
when he declared that all Catholic officeholders in government "have a positive 
moral obligation" to work for the repeal of laws permitting abortion. Mahony 
did not threaten church sanctions, however. 
</P>
<P>
In other areas, Mahony's protracted, losing battle with Catholic cemetery 
workers who voted to unionize led to strained relations in Los Angeles with 
organized labor leaders. But Mahony won praise in the civic arena for his 
efforts to help AIDS sufferers with hospices and to defend the rights of 
immigrants and refugees, as well as for serving on the city commission that 
wrote a wide-ranging ethics code for Los Angeles officials. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the archbishop became chairman of the Catholic bishops' 
International Policy Committee, making him the point man on policy statements 
on Vietnam and the Middle East and a spokesman for the bishops' views on 
foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Merely being the spiritual and administrative leader of the nation's most 
populous (now 3.4 million Catholics) archdiocese would seem to ensure automatic 
newsmaker status for the resident archbishop. But that hasn't always been the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Mahony's predecessor, publicity-shy Cardinal Timothy Manning, avoided the 
public spotlight. Manning, who learned early this year that he was suffering 
from cancer and died in June at 79, was in the news more in 1989 than he was 
during most of the 15 years he headed the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
Other religion newsmakers in Southern California during the year included two 
Buddhists: the Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize during his second 
extended visit to this region, and U.S.-born Buddhist leader Osel Tendzin, who 
went into seclusion in La Jolla (later in Ojai) after leaders of his Tibetan 
sect accused him of not disclosing that he was infected with the AIDS virus 
while continuing to have homosexual relationships. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Rev. Fred Price of Crenshaw Christian Center opened the 
largest-capacity church in the country last September, his 10,145-seat 
FaithDome in South-Central Los Angeles. The same month, Bill Bright, 
founder-president of Campus Crusade for Christ, announced that the group's 
headquarters will move from San Bernardino to Orlando, Fla., in a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
* FLOAT 
</P>
<P>
For the 39th year, a layman's league affiliated with the Lutheran 
Church-Missouri Synod will have a float in the Tournament of Roses Parade on 
Jan. 1 in Pasadena. The only religiously sponsored float amid 60 entries, it 
will feature a dove with outstretched wings that lower at key points along the 
parade. 
</P>
<P>
* PEOPLE 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. James Angell, former pastor (1969-87) of Claremont Presbyterian Church 
and now serving temporarily at St. Mark Presbyterian Church in Newport Beach, 
will serve as interim pastor, starting in March, at historic Madison Avenue 
Presbyterian Church in New York City. The Rev. David H. C. Read, who held forth 
at the Manhattan pulpit for 33 years, retired this month at 80. JOHN DART

SAN DIEGO NEARING THE 1990S WITH A POTENTIAL FOR GREAT THINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most architects seem to agree that the last decade was more of a painful 
adolescence than a graceful maturing. But many lessons learned during the past 
10 years have advanced San Diego's architectural scene to the point where the 
city appears poised for great things in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Most observers are hard-pressed to name any landmark buildings put up in the 
past 10 years, and only one may stand the test of time: the new San Diego 
Convention Center, architect Arthur Erickson's masterpiece of concrete 
geometries. 
</P>
<P>
But if there weren't many outstanding buildings for a city that recently became 
the nation's sixth largest, there were other milestones. 
</P>
<P>
As the decade began, former Mayor Pete Wilson led the way toward developing a 
new downtown core. Its transformation from a place with little retail activity 
and virtually no residential base to an urban center that incorporates both, as 
well as the awesome pace of development elsewhere in the city, often proceeded 
too quickly for the good of architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Horton Plaza evolved from a mall with many street-level openings to a closed-in 
design. This has proven successful commercially but less viable as a tool aimed 
at revitalizing nearby streets. And architect Jon Jerde's Disneyland-ish 
takeoff on postmodernism is bound to look dated in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown, the Centre City Development Corp. struggled to create a mechanism by 
which significant new projects could evolve with input not only from their 
architects and developers, but also from city planners, community groups, 
economic consultants and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
The Courtyard, a 40-story apartment tower for a site at Front and G streets, 
typified this struggle. Three development proposals were sent back for 
revamping, and Johnson Fain &amp; Pereira Associates of Los Angeles replaced 
San Diego architect Rob Quigley on the team that eventually won the job. 
</P>
<P>
Their proposed design seems good in terms of human scale and local context, but 
the confusion of the drawn-out CCDC process may have scared off developers and 
architects from future opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Context, and the question of whether there could ever be a regional 
architecture here, continued to perplex San Diego architects. 
</P>
<P>
Some are starting to realize that "context" doesn't necessarily mean borrowing 
from Balboa Park's towers and domes, or lifting architectural elements from 
nearby buildings. 
</P>
<P>
It's a good sign that architects are finding more subtle ways of addressing the 
climate and life style of the area as well as the specific needs of building 
users. 
</P>
<P>
The increased quality of large projects, both public and private, was a 
countywide trend in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
New civic center designs in Oceanside and Escondido proved that excellent 
architecture can happen when architects listen to a variety of comments and 
carefully consider site and context. 
</P>
<P>
Behind both civic centers are design competitions that attracted entries from 
large and small architectural firms and forums that gave the public ample 
opportunity to submit their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
Public awareness of architecture increased immensely during the decade. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Home/Garden magazine is thriving after 10 years in business, with the 
best of local home design as a significant portion of its contents. 
</P>
<P>
The local chapter of the American Institute of Architects honors the best and 
worst of local architecture as selected by a jury that includes several 
non-architects. Started in 1976, the Orchids &amp; Onions program came of age 
in the '80s. This year, more than 1,000 people attended the awards event at 
Symphony Hall. While it may be argued whether the program takes architecture 
seriously enough, it gets people talking about architecture, and that is good. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's largest firms went through a decade of transition. With the city's 
rapid growth, many enjoyed tremendous business success, and, by the mid-'80s, 
were turning out designs at breakneck speed. Their staffs expanded accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
However, as the decade came to a close, some firms saw a need to either scale 
back their operations for the sake of quality control, or to revamp them, 
putting more emphasis on design. 
</P>
<P>
"We had 110 people, but we decided that to do the sizes of projects we wanted 
to do, a staff of 70 to 85 would be best," said Gordon Carrier, president of 
BSHA. He admitted that design quality had slipped. "We made a conscious effort 
to scale back. I think it has to do with giving more personal service, and 
realizing that good design comes from being able to control what's going on 
more." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego architects, at large and small shops, were faced with a wave of 
out-of-town competition in the late '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Graves (The Aventine in La Jolla), Arthur Erickson, Moore Ruble Yudell 
(Escondido and Oceanside civic centers), Helmut Jahn (Great American Plaza 
downtown), Robert Stern (Prospect Point), Robert Venturi (La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art expansion), and Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill (Symphony 
Towers) designed projects here for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
While many showed little regard for their setting (most notably Jahn, Graves 
and SOM), MRY and Erickson, in particular, gave fresh design responses. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the new preponderance of projects by name architects put local 
developers and architects on notice that the level of design sophistication has 
reached a new high in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
If the '80s belonged to any one local architect, it was Rob Quigley. His 
attempts to break new ground did not always satisfy everyone, or even the 
architect himself, but Quigley single-handedly did more creative work than any 
local rival. His accomplishments were validated by awards from the local AIA. 
In his best year, 1985, he walked away with an unprecedented five out of 17 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
Quigley's work is reaching a mature phase. His Linda Vista Library, with its 
energetic forms, thoughtful interior layout, use of light and inventive 
combinations of materials is one of his best designs yet. 
</P>
<P>
His maturity is symbolic of a trend during the '80s, a decade in which 
postmodernism bloomed and withered in the space of a few years. The movement's 
intent -- to return richness and warmth to architecture after years of sterile 
modernism -- was valid, but it lacked in execution. 
</P>
<P>
While the excessive frills are vanishing, what remains is a new concern for 
detailing and people-oriented designs. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the swan song for postmodernism in San Diego is superstar architect 
Michael Graves' design of The Aventine in La Jolla. Love it or hate it, this 
magnificent office-hotel complex at Interstate 5 and La Jolla Village Drive is 
one of the architect's best works, and it sets a new standard for detailing and 
quality of materials. 
</P>
<P>
A strong educational scene helps upgrade the architecture of any city. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State University offers an environmental design program. The New 
School of Architecture opened in 1981, and moved downtown in 1988. UC San Diego 
is about to name a dean for a new architecture school, which was launched 
earlier this year with an daylong symposium featuring architectural demigods 
Ricardo Legorreta, Richard Meier, Richard Rogers and Fumihiko Maki. 
</P>
<P>
Probably nothing sums up the increased interest in architecture at decade's end 
better than that symposium. Mandeville Auditorium was packed.

WEEKEND CHECKLIST FOR DIGGERS, PLANTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen: 
</P>
<P>
* Bare-root planting season is here. Look for bare-root roses, fruit and shade 
trees, asparagus, artichokes, grape vines and berries such as raspberries, 
blackberries and strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
* Fruit trees will appreciate pruning now; however, don't prune 
spring-flowering trees or shrubs until they finish blooming. 
</P>
<P>
* Continue feeding your annuals and pinching off their faded blooms so they 
will keep flowering in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't neglect your garden just because it's winter -- a winter garden can be 
filled with color from camellias, primroses, pansies, violas, snapdragons and 
more.

Three times in the five previous Freedom Bowls, at least a quarter of those who 
bought tickets have failed to show up for the game. On at least one occasion 
weather may have accounted for those who shelled out and then didn't attend -- 
it was raining at game time the first time the bell rang for a Freedom Bowl, in 
1984. The fewest no-shows, 10%, occurred in 1986 -- perhaps because UCLA was 
appearing in the game.

PHOTOGRAPHY: KEEPING A RECORD OF HOME ITEMS, ARTWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LACHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most people consider shooting photographs as a way to record the events in 
their lives. But photography has a practical purpose -- it's a way to keep 
records of your household inventory and artwork. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting these photographic records can be accomplished simply with a flash and 
a camera, or elaborately with multiple lights and a large format camera on a 
tripod. 
</P>
<P>
Nora M. Sharpe of Costa Mesa recently asked about art: "I am a ceramic artist 
and keep a record of my work with slides and photographs. I also use slides and 
photographs to send to galleries and enter competitions. I have had some work 
photographed by a professional photographer but would like to do the work 
myself, although I have developing done by a local photo lab. 
</P>
<P>
"How can I make the light more dramatic? Should one use contrasting paper in 
the backgrounds? If you use a dark object against white paper, how do you take 
the reflective light into consideration; just by the light meter?" 
</P>
<P>
There's little doubt that shooting quality copy photographs of your artwork can 
be the difference between winning or losing a competition, since your effort 
may be judged on the quality of a 35-millimeter slide. Also, sending your 
original artwork would be too cumbersome to transport or mail. 
</P>
<P>
The key is to set up a system for photographing your work and then staying with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
With flat artwork, which includes paintings, lithographs and drawings, it's 
necessary to ensure that the subject is evenly illuminated. Shooting it in the 
shade or with two lights from two sides at a 45-degree angle works well. 
</P>
<P>
You should stay away from bright sun for copying work. The glare and 
reflections make it a difficult light source to control. Using one light 
directed from the camera isn't recommended because of the reflection it will 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting three-dimensional objects is more difficult because you need 
additional lighting techniques to give the object its form. Also, the 
background is very important. Stay away from distracting patterns -- brick and 
stucco walls or old fences. They won't do justice to your work. 
</P>
<P>
Consider buying a roll of backdrop paper from your local camera store. The 
colors and reflective surface can vary, allowing you the opportunity to use 
your imagination. Those with multiple lighting setups can change the color of 
the backdrop by using colored gels over the light directed at the background. 
This will give variety without the need to change rolls of background paper. 
</P>
<P>
Use a background of contrasting colors to make your work stand out. Loud colors 
are not advised unless they are suited to the art. 
</P>
<P>
A tripod is essential. It will enable your to use a slow shutter speed and an 
f-stop of f/11, f/16 or f/22 that will produce great depth of field, keeping 
your work in focus. 
</P>
<P>
If you're using a setup in the shade, your light will be flat and very low in 
contrast. For most situations, this is the easiest method. But to produce 
dramatic results, use multiple lighting setups. A simple place to start is with 
one light at a 45-degree angle and another light with half the power directed 
from the other side. 
</P>
<P>
Next, move the lights to vary the shadows and highlight areas. Experimentation 
is a must. Since each piece of artwork is an original, you should try to light 
it in a unique way. Make notes as you work and take an extra shot of each setup 
so you can have record of how you did it. 
</P>
<P>
Get the proper exposure by moving in close to obtain an accurate meter reading 
of the reflected light from your subject. This is critical, especially if your 
background is black or white. Bracketing your exposure will be your best 
insurance for proper exposure. 
</P>
<P>
If you're shooting in the shade, you may find it necessary to use a filter to 
correct the bluish cast. Select an 81A or 81B filter to avoid the problem. If 
you choose to light your subject with tungsten light and are shooting 
transparencies (slides), select film designed for this light. 
</P>

ON THE WATERFRONT: GROUP WORKS TO REGULATE WHALE WATCHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEARLEAN DUKE, Shearlean Duke is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last winter, Judy Lakin went whale watching for seven hours at a stretch, every 
weekend for eight weeks -- regardless of the weather. She was there not so much 
to watch the whales, but to watch the people who watch the whales. 
</P>
<P>
As a volunteer observer, Lakin was gathering information for an informal study 
that would help the Orange County Marine Institute develop an educational 
program to teach boaters how to watch the giant marine mammals without harming 
them or interfering with their migration. 
</P>
<P>
Each year from January through March, thousands of people venture out to sea in 
the hopes of catching a glimpse of the migrating California gray whales that 
travel 12,000 miles from the Bering Sea off Siberia and Alaska to Mexico and 
back. 
</P>
<P>
During recent years, there has been speculation that some whale watching 
actually results in harassment of the marine mammals. As a result, the National 
Marine Fisheries Service is in the process of drawing up whale-watching 
regulations that should take effect sometime in 1991, according to Jim Lecky, a 
wildlife biologist with the service. 
</P>
<P>
"We are drafting the regulations now," Lecky says, "but it is unlikely that 
they will take effect in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
The new regulations will probably convert the existing whale-watching 
guidelines published by the National Marine Fisheries Service into enforceable 
laws, according to Lecky. Current guidelines instruct whale watchers to 
approach whales slowly from behind, maintain a slow, consistent speed, and stay 
at least 100 yards away from the whales. 
</P>
<P>
"Our intention is to codify our guidelines so that they will be easier to 
enforce," Lecky says. "We held a big conference in Monterey last year and the 
consensus of that group was that there needs to be regulations. The major 
problem is not the commercial whale-watch operations. The biggest problem is 
the weekend boaters, out there in their own boats, who tend to be uninformed 
and do not understand that their action may be detrimental to the long-term 
survival of these populations" of gray whales, Lecky says. 
</P>
<P>
In the informal study conducted last year by the Orange County Marine 
Institute, it was found that 69 of 264 vessels observed approached within the 
100-yard limit recommended by the National Marine Fisheries Service, according 
to Harry Helling, director of education at the Marine Institute. And during 12 
of the 23 whale watches conducted during the study, at least one boater was 
observed to approach a whale at excess speed. Other findings from the informal 
survey: 
</P>
<P>
* The average number of boats converged upon one whale was 11. 
</P>
<P>
* In 15 of 23 whale-watching trips, at least one boat crossed in front of a 
gray whale. 
</P>
<P>
* Of 23 whales sighted, 17 showed a noticeable change in direction. 
</P>
<P>
"That is a very large number," says Helling on the number of whales observed 
changing direction, "much higher than we anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
Helling pointed out that the study was not a formal scientific project, but was 
merely what he calls a "pre-study." "We wanted to look at the interaction 
between boaters and whales while whale watching. So this involved an observer 
(Lakin) and myself going out on 23 whale-watching trips. What we were 
attempting to do was quantify boater behavior so that we as educators and 
leaders could address some of those behaviors with an educational campaign 
aimed at boaters." 
</P>
<P>
Although Helling is hesitant to draw any hard conclusions from the survey, he 
says: "Informally, we can say during the weekend in our area there are many 
boats that will gather on whales and while they are gathering in these 
clusters, there are boater behaviors which don't conform to the National Marine 
Fisheries Service guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
During the upcoming whale-watching season, Helling and at least four 
volunteers, including Lakin, a resident of Capistrano Beach and an avid whale 
watcher, will conduct additional formal research that will be shared with the 
National Marine Fisheries Service. "We are in the process now of working with 
the service to modify our research design," Helling says. "By mid-January, we 
will begin the survey." 
</P>
<P>
Although Helling says he is still in the process of deciding how the formal 
study will be done, he says this year's project will also involve seven- to 
eight-hour-a-day whale-watching trips. 
</P>
<P>
Last year in another informal survey, Helling and volunteers questioned 94 
recreational boaters and discovered that only 43% were aware that any sort of 
whale-watching guidelines existed. Of those who knew about the guidelines, only 
28% knew the correct distance for whale watching. 
</P>
<P>
"So given that information and other things we have observed," Helling says, 
"the problem is first an educational problem and then an enforcement problem. 
The ideal would be to update and upgrade both the enforcement and education." 
</P>
<P>
It is illegal to harass whales under the Marine Mammal Protection Law and each 
year several cases of harassment are handled by the National Marine Fisheries 
Service, Lecky says. "Most of those involve private vessels and pretty 
outrageous things like separating migrating pairs of whales and running up to 
within several feet or circling around whales." 
</P>
<P>
Helling points out that the once nearly extinct gray whale has made a 
remarkable comeback, recovering from a population of under 1,000 to an 
estimated population of more than 20,000. "So we have this tremendous success 
story that plays itself out every winter off our coast," he says. "And here we 
are confronted by another type of threat to the whale population. For example, 
not just whale watching, but pollution, (increased) vessel traffic, oil 
drilling -- even acoustic pollution. Cetaceans are so dependent upon sound. We 
need to look at how we impact them with noise, too." 
</P>
<P>
During whale-watching season, which begins in January, the Orange County Marine 
Institute, 24200 Dana Point Harbor Drive, Dana Point, offers educational 
lectures about whales and conducts whale-watching tours. For information, call 
(714) 831-3850.

JAPANESE: POTENTIAL FORCE IN RACING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL MORAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Horse of the '80s? Spectacular Bid? Personal Ensign? Alysheba? The pollsters 
have been busy in racing as they have in every area, but the curtain was drawn 
on a decade of racing in a Kentucky auction ring, not in the reminiscence of 
equine heroics. With the drawing of that curtain came a glimpse of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
The decade hung by a thread when the men who have dominated American racing in 
the '80s walked into the sales pavilion at Keeneland in Lexington, Ky., two 
days after the sixth Breeders' Cup was run at Gulfstream Park in Florida and 
cashed in their chips. The curtain fell with a thud on a troubled decade of 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Klein was the owner of the '80s, whose thick checkbook provided the 
rocket fuel for Wayne Lukas, the trainer of the '80s. Actually, Lukas was the 
quintessential manager of '80s horseflesh, operating under the guise of a 
trainer, and he dominated the decade statistically as no man has ever dominated 
thoroughbred racing. 
</P>
<P>
Here are Lukas' totals for the decade: 11 Eclipse Awards, seven Breeders' Cup 
victories, a Kentucky Derby, a Preakness, a filly triple crown, a Horse of the 
Year title and almost $30 million in purses. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a decade after selling the San Diego Chargers of the National 
Football League and placing his racing fate into Lukas' hands, Klein liquidated 
his considerable equine assets (the auction yielded slightly less than $30 
million), leaving him a financial loser. 
</P>
<P>
Once six years of expenses and commissions were factored into an unforgiving 
equation, Klein's ledgers bled red; his unbridled accomplishment, a matter of 
inarguable record, was achieved dearly. For every champion he sold in the 
long-awaited dispersal came a dozen liabilities. Tough business, this. 
</P>
<P>
The checkbook of the '80s, having accomplished what no owner had dared dream in 
centuries of racing, is gone. As Klein was leaving, Kazou Nakamura of Japan 
made the final bid on the 3-year-old filly who will make it an even dozen 
Eclipse Awards for Klein in February, and purchased Open Mind for $4.6 million. 
The force of the '80s steps aside in deference to what is seen as the force of 
the '90s -- the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"They've bought a ton of stallions, both here and in Europe," said Dan Farley, 
Lexington-based American general manager for the International Racing Bureau. 
"Until recently, they've concentrated on European pedigrees with an emphasis on 
stamina, but they've been more active here recently and since they are 
prohibited from taking horses back to Japan and racing them, it's likely that 
they will play a more prominent role in racing here. Open Mind, for instance, 
will remain in training and continue to race here, probably with a trainer 
other than Lukas." 
</P>
<P>
In Lexington, the men whose business is breeding horses see the Japanese as 
particularly welcome, amply funded additions to the international bloodstock 
market -- the Arabs of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
But regardless of who the players are or from what nation the money that fuels 
the breeding industry originates, the domestic issues racing faces entering the 
new decade are essentially those it faced entering t he '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Racing's most glaring shortcomings, as they were at the threshold of the '80s, 
are its industry-wide fragmentation, abysmally inept leadership in its most 
important market -- New York -- and the aging of its customer base. 
</P>
<P>
The sport suffers from a lack of direction and singular focus that will be 
corrected only by the establishment of a national ruling and licensing body 
headed by a board of stewards, to which individual state commissions would be 
responsible. It suffers, in an age of equine air travel that enables horses to 
race in many states during the course of a season, from lack of standard rules 
and procedures -- particularly medication rules and testing procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Although they face common problems and share common goals, little progress was 
made during the decade to move racing's individual interests toward a 
consolidation of resources and effort. Racing executives, tenaciously 
protective of their individual turf, have failed to visualize the big picture, 
and virtually no leadership has come from its largest market. Its national 
organizations -- The Jockey Club, Thoroughbred Racing Associations, Racing 
Commissioners International -- are esstentially powerless and have little 
influence on the industry's self-interested segments. 
</P>
<P>
This deeply rooted fragmentation holds true at every level, particularly at the 
top. During the last two decades, beginning with its early '70s decision to 
decline the operation of off-track betting, the New York Racing Association has 
become an example of, if not the personification of, everything that is wrong 
with the industry entering the '90s. At least one NYRA executive has wondered 
privately whether the sport in New York will survive the NYRA franchise, which 
expires at the end of the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
Such concern is well founded, because it is a widely held belief that the 
decline of racing in New York can be reversed only after wholesale replacement 
of the current administration -- President Gerard McKeon and his top aides, 
senior vice presidents Martin Lieberman, John Keenan and Lenny Hale, after a 
new chairman is named to replace Thomas Bancroft, who will step down in early 
1990, five months before the end of his term. 
</P>
<P>
Under this group, New York racing has become an industry model of 
oversaturation of the market with year-round racing, declining quality of the 
product, alienation of the fan base and its own employee force, ineffective 
governmental relationships and benign neglect of its blithely oblivious board 
of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
But the '80s was not an altogether negative decade for racing, and the positive 
developments will continue to have impact into the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was the decade during which the Breeders' Cup was established and during 
which Churchill Downs and Gulfstream Park provided examples of how a racing 
association can work effectively with the business community as well as local 
and state governments to stage the event properly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was the decade in which commercial sponsorship, which will dominate 
racing in the '90s, came into its own, a lesson that should have been learned 
from other sports and European racing years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was the decade that saw the resurgence of racing in Maryland and 
Illinois and provided an example for the '90s of what effective, intelligent 
leadership and beneficial working relationships with state governments can 
accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It was the decade during which racing's presence on commerical and cable 
television and the establishment of several new racing periodicals resulted in 
unprecedented exposure for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
None of this will mean very much unless racing also confronts the graying of 
its audience and finds more effective means to reach a younger clientele. To 
this end, it can learn much from the casino industry, which it considers its 
enemy. The lesson to which it seems deaf, said Tom Merritt, executive director 
of Thoroughbred Racing Communications, a media-service agency founded two years 
ago by the Jockey Club that has been highly effective, is the concept of 
convenience, creature comfort and entertainment as integral parts of the 
racetrack experience.

LAKERS WIN IN BIG WAY; 
</P>
<P>
NBA: GOLDEN STATE'S SMALL LINEUP IS OVERMATCHED. LOS ANGELES PUSHES BALL INSIDE 
FOR A 130-111 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Manute Bol sat stoically on the bench Friday night, those bony knees up near 
his eyes. Uwe Blab slouched close by, making it a combined 14 feet 8 inches of 
height wasting away on the Golden State Warriors' bench. 
</P>
<P>
So much for the Lakers' recent problems establishing an inside game. All they 
had to do to ensure victory was corral this running, scrambling version of the 
Warriors and move the game inside where they, for once, held a significant 
height advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers did all that with little trouble, breaking out of a recent offensive 
slump with a resounding 130-111 victory before a Forum crowd of 17,505. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking a change after being hammered by the Clippers on Thursday night, 
Warrior Coach Don Nelson went small against the Lakers. It had been a 
successful strategy last season, making opponents alter styles and matchups and 
generally causing confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"All I'm trying to do is find the best way to win a game," Nelson said. "We 
thought if we came in here and took a chance and tried something different, 
maybe we'd win." 
</P>
<P>
All it meant Friday was that the Laker big men -- and that constituted anybody 
taller than 6-7 -- had big nights. 
</P>
<P>
Laker small forward James Worthy, who at 6-9 towered over any Warrior defender, 
scored 34 points, one short of his season high, and had 12 rebounds. Orlando 
Woolridge, also 6-9, reached his season high with 22 points. And center Mychal 
Thompson, in his first game back after missing two weeks with a sore heel, had 
13 points and 10 rebounds in 23 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
All told, the Lakers made 37 of 53 field-goal attempts either inside or on the 
fast break and held a 52-35 rebounding advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The sight of Bol and Blab sitting like bookends practically made Laker forwards 
salivate. "I was licking my chops," Woolridge said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Thompson: "Without Manute in the middle, you got to force feed (the ball) 
down low until you feel like you got indigestion. We kept going there." 
</P>
<P>
Because the Lakers were so effective inside, as well as eventually slowing the 
Warriors' running game, the Lakers' outside game opened for Byron Scott and 
Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Scott had his second consecutive productive game after enduring a road slump. 
This time, Scott scored 21 points, 12 coming in the third quarter when the 
Lakers blew open a close game. He made nine of 15 shots, including a 
three-pointer midway through the fourth quarter that gave the Lakers their 
first 20-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson added 16 points and 17 assists, setting up low-post players for 
baskets, including a lob pass to Woolridge for a dunk with 4.9 seconds left in 
the third quarter that gave the Lakers their first double-figure lead. 
</P>
<P>
Desperate for a victory, the Warriors (10-17) put up a good fight for a while, 
trailing 63-56 going into the second half. The Warriors were led by Chris 
Mullin, who had 25 points and 14 rebounds. Terry Teagle added 23 points and 
Mitch Richmond 22. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Coach Pat Riley said he was not surprised by the Warriors' tactics and 
was impressed by the swift way the Lakers exploited the matchups. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a good job getting the ball down to our low-post people," Riley said. 
"We just wanted to take it in, take it in, keep doing that. If we're going to 
try to match jump shot to jump shot with that team, we'll lose." 
</P>
<P>
There was little chance of that Friday night, after the Lakers decided to 
burrow in against the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers made 51.4% of their shots, the second consecutive game they have 
made better than 50%. It was only the second time this season the Lakers have 
shot well in consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
"We did some good things tonight," Johnson said. "Hopefully, this is an 
indication of things to come. We got out and put some points on the board." 
</P>
<P>
So, after struggling to turn back Minnesota and Sacramento in their previous 
two games, the Lakers enjoyed a rare easy night. 
</P>
<P>
They now break for the New Year's holiday with a 21-6 record, best in the NBA. 
They have won three in a row, seven of eight. And, Friday night being their 
final game in the 1980s, the Lakers finished the decade with a 584-222 record 
-- a 72.5% winning percentage. "We've been blessed with talent, good fortune 
and good health," said Riley, summing up the decade. "If not for the coaching, 
they would have won eight championships." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Golden State Coach Don Nelson said before Friday night's game that he wants to 
coach the United States Olympic basketball team in the 1992 Olympics at 
Barcelona, Spain. "I would take a year off (of coaching the Warriors) to do 
it," Nelson said. "I'd do whatever they (the U.S. Olympic Committee) would want 
me to do. It has been a dream of mine my whole life. I didn't have a chance to 
serve in the Armed Forces, and I didn't have a chance to try out for the 
Olympic team in 1960." . . . Mike Schuler, Golden State assistant coach, 
confirmed that he will be interviewed today for the head coaching job of the 
Sacramento Kings. John MacLeod, the recently fired Dallas Maverick coach, is 
said to be the Kings' top choice. Schuler is expected to be offered the job 
should MacLeod decline. Would Schuler accept? "That's something I can't 
possibly comment on until I talk to them," he said. . . . Vlade Divac, the 
Lakers' Yugoslav center, spent a day off on Thursday meeting with Dusan 
Ivkovic, the coach of the Yugoslav national team, in Los Angeles. Divac said 
Ivkovic is in the United States to check in on the Yugoslavs in the NBA. Divac, 
Drazen Petrovic of the Portland Trail Blazers and Zarko Paspalj of the San 
Antonio Spurs all will play for their country in international competition 
after the NBA season . . . Center Mychal Thompson returned Friday night after 
missing six games with bursitis in his left heel. Coach Pat Riley has suggested 
that Divac might start in Thompson's place, or that A.C. Green might start at 
center against smaller teams, but Thompson said he would not mind coming off 
the bench. "I'm not worried about that," Thompson said. "All I want to do is 
help us win. Of course, I do like that (starting), except when they announced 
my name, everybody said, who's that?"' Thompson, it turned out, did start 
Friday's game.

BRUINS FIND THE RANGE QUICKLY IN 115-66 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
East Tennessee State came to Pauley Pavilion Friday night with enough 
credentials to pull off an upset of UCLA. But such prospects essentially 
disappeared soon after the opening tip-off. 
</P>
<P>
The 16th-ranked Bruins controlled the nonconference game from start to finish 
and were never threatened in a 115-66 victory in front of 7,466. 
</P>
<P>
This came against a team that less than two weeks ago defeated North Carolina 
State by 10 points, at Raleigh, N.C. A team that, after finishing fourth last 
season in the Southern Conference, won its postseason tournament and took a 
20-point lead over Oklahoma in the first round of the NCAA tournament, only to 
lose, 72-71. 
</P>
<P>
But on Friday night, the Bruins, who have been known to squander a lead here 
and there against teams with less talent than East Tennessee State, appeared 
intent on finishing the decade on a positive note. 
</P>
<P>
"We aired everything out tonight," said the Bruins' Kevin Walker, who quickly 
broke out of a slump by converting his first two shots -- both three-pointers 
-- and finishing with 15 points and five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I was happy with the first (three-pointer), but even happier with the second. 
Anyone can make one. I needed both." said Walker, who credited a pregame talk 
with UCLA Coach Jim Harrick for his breaking out of a slump. 
</P>
<P>
Walker was one of seven Bruins in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
True, the Buccaneers had just returned from a Hawaiian holiday, which included 
three games in the Chaminade tournament over Christmas weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins had struggled to defeat Fresno State on Wednesday night. But Friday, 
they achieved their most lopsided victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a talented team, but one that's been on the road for two weeks," 
Harrick said. "I would be dying to get home." 
</P>
<P>
Leading by 19 at halftime, UCLA kept the Buccaneers at bay the rest of the 
game, forcing 23 turnovers and keeping the pressure on East Tennessee State's 
outside shooters. 
</P>
<P>
Largely because of that pressure applied by Trevor Wilson, the Buccaneers' 
leading scorer, Calvin Talford, was held to 11 points. He had been averaging 
17.6. 
</P>
<P>
Center Greg Dennis led the Buccaneers (8-3) with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
Don MacLean continued his hot hand, leading the Bruins (8-1) with 21 points. 
Tracy Murray finished with 14, while Trevor Wilson, Darrick Martin and Mitchell 
Butler had 13 apiece. Wilson, UCLA's leading scorer until Friday night, played 
only 26 minutes and had seven rebounds and eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean and Wilson got the Bruins started offensively, teaming to open a 9-0 
lead before Alvin West scored the Buccaneers' first basket 2:08 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruin defense, meanwhile, kept the pressure on East Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins opened a 30-12 lead before four different Buccaneers scored 
consecutive baskets -- including a three-point shot by Talford -- to cut the 
deficit to nine with 8:30 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, who had been outstanding in recent games, stole an inbounds pass and 
Keith Owens dunked the ball to spark the Bruins again. Murray played 10 minutes 
in the first half, scoring just four points but grabbing four rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Walker was six of eight from the floor in the first half, including three 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
MacLean, who was 25 for 43 in the Bruins' previous three games, was six of 12 
in the first half, scoring 13 points. MacLean leads the Bruins in scoring with 
a 19.8-point average. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins led by 15 with 5:60 left and didn't let up as they shot 57.5% in 
building a 57-36 halftime lead. The Bruins finished the game shooting 60%. 
</P>
<P>
Said Harrick: "I'm really glad we had some fun. Every game has been a nail 
biter for the coaching staff." 
</P>
<P>
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
Reserve guard Kevin Williams did not suit up Friday night because he has flu. . 
. . Tracy Murray has scored in double figures in his last five games. . . . 
UCLA has shot better than 50% in each of its last five games after shooting 
less than 45% in each of the first four. . . . The Bruins' 8-1 start is their 
best since 1983-84 when they opened with a 10-1 record. . . . The Bruins' 60% 
shooting was a season best. The previous best was 54.2% Wednesday night against 
Fresno State. The Bruins are shooting 49.6% as a team. . . . The Bruins' 115 
points is the most since the opening game of the 1987-88 season, when they 
defeated Oral Roberts University, 119-79. . . . UCLA junior Keith Owens scored 
a career-high 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Walker had been one for 16 on three pointers. He hit all three Friday 
night. Walker had only 24 points through the first eight games. Said Coach Jim 
Harrick: "He was trying too hard and that's really it. I wanted to keep 
starting him because of what's coming up." . . . Trevor Wilson is the No. 10 
career scorer in Bruin history with 1,406. He surpassed Walt Hazzard, who 
scored 1,401. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Jeff Bronner, who has been a member of the UCLA team since last season, 
has accepted a scholarship to UC Riverside and will transfer next week. He will 
have two years eligibility remaining.

BACK TO NORMAL: PENN STATE WINS WILD ONE; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAY BOWL: REVIVING THE GAME'S STRANGE AND HIGH-SCORING TRADITION, THE 
NITTANY LIONS USE AN OPPORTUNISTIC DEFENSE TO PUT AWAY TY DETMER AND BYU, 
50-39. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Proving true the old adage that there is more than one way to skin a cat, the 
Nittany Lions of Penn State and the Cougars of Brigham Young met in the 12th 
annual Holiday Bowl Friday night in a game of contrasting styles. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' idea was to beat the Cougars with their running game and a strong 
defense. The Cougars' plan against the Lions was to live and die by the pass. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions' way won, though barely. They used the running of All-American 
tailback Blair Thomas and a defense that yielded a school-record 576 yards 
passing to BYU quarterback Ty Detmer but found a way to stop BYU when it 
mattered the most. The result was a 50-39 victory in front of a sellout crowd 
61,113 at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas gained 186 yards and scored one touchdown on a Holiday Bowl-record 35 
carries. That earned him a share of the offensive player of the game award with 
Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer completed 42 of 59 passes for 576 yards and two touchdowns and two 
interceptions. He also ran for two touchdowns in a performance that was as 
spectacular as Thomas' was relentless. The attempts and completions both were 
bowl records. 
</P>
<P>
But the difference was two bizarre plays that will go down among the wildest in 
Holiday Bowl, if not college football, history. 
</P>
<P>
The first was a failed BYU conversion pass with 2:34 remaining that Penn State 
linebacker Andre Collins returned 102 yards for two points, the first time that 
has happened in a bowl game under a two-year-old NCAA rule. 
</P>
<P>
The second came less than two minutes later when, with BYU driving for a shot 
at a go-ahead touchdown, Detmer was stripped of the ball by hero back Gary 
Brown as he attempted to pass. Brown then raced 53 yards for a touchdown with 
45 seconds left, closing out the Cougars (10-3). 
</P>
<P>
Those unusual twists were a fitting return to form for the Holiday Bowl after 
Oklahoma State's uncharacteristic 62-14 rout over Wyoming. It was the tenth 
time in its 12-year history that the game came down to the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the screwiest game I've ever been involved in, and we've had our 
share," BYU Coach LaVell Edwards said. "I thought we were going to win it at 
the end, right up until Gary Brown's play." 
</P>
<P>
The teams combined for 1,115 yards in total offense with the Cougars gaining 
651. Penn State's 50 points was its most since a 56-18 over William &amp; Mary 
in 1984 and its most ever in a bowl game. With those kinds of numbers, it was 
no wonder that the selection committee opted against picking defensive players 
of the game, choosing instead to have co-offensive players. But that does not 
mean the Lions did have some worthy nominations. 
</P>
<P>
Collins and Brown qualified for shear dramatics, but free safety Sherrod Rainge 
made his mark with two interceptions and a break-up of a Detmer pass intended 
for tight end Chris Smith as he streaked toward the end zone with 57 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
There also was a Holiday Bowl-record 51-yard field goal by Penn State senior 
Ray Tarasi. 
</P>
<P>
That it came down to a final harried minutes was testament to the skill of 
Detmer and the BYU passing attack. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State (8-3-1) appeared ready to tuck the game away when split end Dave 
Daniels and quarterback Tony Sacca completed a 52-yard touchdown pass play that 
gave the Lions a 41-26 lead with 9:28 left. 
</P>
<P>
But BYU answered quickly with three Detmer completions for 67 yards to set up a 
one-yard touchdown run by fullback Fred Whittingham that cut the lead to 41-33 
with 8:51 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
After forcing Penn State to punt, the Cougars lauched another scoring drive. 
This ended with Detmer's three-yard pass to wide receiver Brent Nyberg with 
2:34 to play to pull BYU within 41-39. The Cougars lined up for a two-point 
conversion that would have tied the game at 41-41, but Collins stepped in front 
of a Detmer pass intended for split end Andy Boyce and set off a dash down the 
left sideline that would make bowl history. 
</P>
<P>
BYU still had one more chance, but that ended when a blitzing Brown jumped 
Detmer, wrested the ball away and dashed to the end zone with much of a 
celebrating Penn State bench in tow. 
</P>
<P>
It was a crazy end to a game that had the promise of something different. 
</P>
<P>
The school colors are the same -- blue and white; the mascots are from the same 
animal family and the schools both sit in snowy mountain valleys, but when it 
comes to football, these universities hail from two entirely different schools. 
</P>
<P>
That was clear from their respective opening series: BYU started by passing on 
all nine plays in its drive; Penn State opened by running nine times in 12 
plays, with Thomas carrying on eight. 
</P>
<P>
In a near-perfect reverse image, the Cougars would end with 59 passes and 23 
rushes to the Lions' 21 passes and 54 rushes. 
</P>
<P>
But not all went to form in this one. The Cougars and Edwards are supposed to 
be the ones known for offensive innovation and trickery. But it was the Lions 
and their coach, Joe Paterno, who pulled the biggest risk with a successful 
fake punt that set up the second of two touchdown runs by fullback Leroy 
Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
And while both teams and coaches have national reputations for running clean 
programs manned with clean-cut student athletes, the game featured 20 penalties 
for 181 yards. Five of those were for unsportsmanlike conduct or personal 
fouls. 
</P>
<P>
The touch of roughhouse, combined with the contrast in offensive styles, added 
to the impression of the game as mirror of the Lions' memorable 1987 Fiesta 
Bowl victory over Miami and its Heisman Trophy quarterback, Vinny Testaverde. 
But while that game was for the national championship, this one was limited to 
determining if No. 18 Penn State was better than No. 19 BYU. The stakes might 
have been lower, but not the show. 
</P>
<P>
The first half was as tense as the second, with the teams taking turns 
exchanging the lead. All that separated the teams was a missed extra point on 
Penn State's only first-half touchdown that allowed the Cougars to cling to a 
13-12 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions scored first on a 30-yard field goal by Tarasi with 7:11 left in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars tied the game at 3-3 just before the end of the quarter on a 
20-yard field by senior Jason Chaffetz. Penn State answered on its next series 
with the game's first touchdown -- a 24-yard pass to flanker Terry Smith from 
Sacca with 13:20 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
The play was almost too easy to believe as Smith lined up uncovered on the wide 
side and just stepped across the the left edge of the goal-line before right 
cornerback Brian Mitchell could recover to make the tackle. 
</P>
<P>
But the lead stayed at 9-3 when Tarasi's extra-point try flew wide right. 
</P>
<P>
BYU came back on its next possession to drive for its lone touchdown of the 
half. The Cougars went 68 yards in 12 plays for the score. 
</P>
<P>
Three times Demter kept the drive alive by completing passes on third and six 
or more. Twice he went to Nyberg for gains of 14 and 24 yards and once to Smith 
for nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
Detmer then added the final touch when he faked a dive over the line to 
halfback Stacey Corley, put the ball on his hip and ran a bootleg right one 
yard into the end zone. Chaffetz added the extra point for a 10-9 lead with 
8:00 left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions went back on top, 12-10, on their next possession on Tarasi's 36-yard 
field goal with 2:01 to halftime. But this was a game in which no lead was safe 
for long. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars took over from at the their 25 after the kickoff, and Detmer 
immediately found halfback Matt Bellini wide open at the BYU 46. Bellini caught 
the pass and ran to the Penn State 24 before being tackled for a 51-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
But after reaching the Penn State four, the Cougars had to settle for 
Chaffetz's 22-yard field goal and a 13-12 halftime lead when Detmer's 
third-and-one pass intended for Bellini sailed out of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The attendance of 61,113 was the third highest in Holiday Bowl history, just 
short of the record 61,892 set in the 1987 game between Iowa and Wyoming.

FULLERTON BEATS MIDDLE TENNESSEE STATE IN WYOMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
CASPER, Wyo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the time Cal State Fullerton made it to Wyoming's wide-open spaces, the 
Titans were a sick-and-tired team. 
</P>
<P>
They were sick with all manner of ailments. And they were tired, and not only 
from their 13-hour trip from Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
They were also tired of losing, after ruining their 5-0 start with a 29-point 
loss to Colorado State and a 12-point loss to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Sneed, still ailing from the remnants of flu, was worried. 
</P>
<P>
"They say a team is a reflection of its coach," Sneed said before the Titans 
played Middle Tennessee State in the first round of the Cowboy Shootout. "If 
they play like I feel, we're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Titans' 77-69 victory over the Blue Raiders in the Casper Events 
Center Friday night proved just the tonic. 
</P>
<P>
"For the moment, a win makes everyone on the team feel better," Sneed said 
after the Titans dispatched Middle Tennessee State by taking a 15-2 lead at the 
outset, never trailing although the Blue Raiders made several runs. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's balance had seemed dangerously close to coming undone the night 
before, at a practice in which leading scorer Cedric Ceballos took an elbow to 
the eye that opened a cut requiring stitches. 
</P>
<P>
At the same practice, reserve Ron Caldwell and Sneed had verbal exchanges that 
left Caldwell on the bench in street clothes Friday. And starting center John 
Sykes, who practiced sparingly, realized he wouldn't be able to start because 
his eyes remain red, irritated by a reaction to eyedrops. 
</P>
<P>
But Fullerton pulled it together against Middle Tennessee State, a team that 
has played in a postseason tournament in each of the past five years, but that 
is off to a 4-4 start with a young team this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been in a rut," Sneed said. "We've had three of four bad practices, 
whether it was the flu, injuries or internal things with a couple of players. 
There's nothing like a win to get you hugging in the locker room again. It was 
a good win on the road, against a good team and a quality coach." 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos, who has made a habit of strong second-half performances, had three 
points at halftime, but finished with 22 points and 16 rebounds, 11 of them in 
the second half. Mark Hill scored 19 for Fullerton, and Wayne Williams added 
13. 
</P>
<P>
Titus Jackson scored 21 for the Blue Raiders, and Robert Taylor added 19. The 
Blue Raiders shot only 34% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had struggled in its past two games, hitting only 34% of its shots. 
</P>
<P>
But this time the Titans made 49% of their shots, which is about their season 
average. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton will play Wyoming in the tournament championship game tonight at 8 
p.m. PST. The Cowboys (6-4) defeated Northeast Louisiana, 73-66, Friday night.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
NORTH CAROLINA FALLS TO COLORADO STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forward Mike Mitchell scored 34 points and guard Mark Meredith hit all five of 
his three-point attempts in the second half to lead Colorado State to a 78-67 
victory over No. 24 North Carolina Friday night in the Mile High tournament at 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State (9-2) held a 31-28 lead at halftime but came out in the second 
half with a near error-free attack to distance itself from the Tar Heels. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina center Scott Williams, who had 14 points in the first half, was 
ineffective after hitting the first basket of the second half to close the 
margin to 31-30. 
</P>
<P>
From there, Colorado State tightened its defense and opened up its outside 
game. Three-point baskets by Mitchell and Eric Friehauf put the Rams ahead, 
43-34, with 15:22 left. 
</P>
<P>
Meredith then connected on three three-point baskets to increase the Rams' lead 
to 57-40 with 9:50 left. His last three-point basket gave the Rams their 
biggest lead at 65-45. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina (7-5) made a brief run at Colorado State, highlighted by a pair 
of three-point baskets by Rick Fox and Jeff Denny, to close to within 66-57. 
</P>
<P>
But Mitchell, who scored 22 of his points in the second half, repeatedly broke 
through the Tar Heels' full-court press for easy dunks and layups. 
</P>
<P>
Williams led the Tar Heels with 23 points; Fox added 15. 
</P>
<P>
No. 2 Kansas 103, Texas-Pan American 83 -- Pekka Markkanen and Jeff Gueldner 
led six players in double figures as the Jayhawks remained unbeaten with a 
victory in the first round of the Holiday tournament at Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas' 12-game winning streak ties the 10th longest in school history and the 
12-0 start is the first since the 1956-57 team started 12-0 en route to the 
NCAA title game. 
</P>
<P>
No. 3 Georgetown 83, Northern Iowa 49 -- Mark Tillmon scored 20 points and 
Alonzo Mourning added 18 to lead the Hoyas to victory at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Northern Iowa (6-2) trailed, 38-35, at halftime and twice pulled within one 
point before falling victim to a 22-0 run by the Hoyas (9-0) early in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
No. 4 Illinois 97, Grambling 73 -- Ervin Small scored a career-high 16 points 
and Andy Kaufmann had 15 as the Illini took control at Rosemont, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Small fouled out with 9:36 remaining. His previous high was 15 points against 
Chicago State earlier this month. Kaufmann had scored 14 points Dec. 20 against 
Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
No. 6 Oklahoma 147, North Texas 94 -- Tony Martin scored 30 points and Terry 
Evans had 26 as the Sooners continued their high-scoring ways in the opening 
game of the All-College tournament at Norman, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
The 147 points were a tournament record, breaking the mark of 144 scored by 
Oklahoma against Oral Roberts in 1987. The 241 total points were a tournament 
record, as was the 53-point spread. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners (7-0) have won four games by 50 or more points, and raised their 
nation-leading average victory margin to 50 points. 
</P>
<P>
Martin had 24 points in the first half against the outmanned, cold-shooting 
Eagles (0-12). 
</P>
<P>
No. 13 Duke 95, Cincinnati 83 -- Led by Christian Laettner, who had 18 points 
and 11 rebounds, the Blue Devils (7-2) used a 19-0 run late in the first half 
to advance to the final of the 26th annual Rainbow tournament at Honolulu.

CHAMINADE STOPPED IN ITS TRACKS BY SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chaminade High paved an easy road for itself to the championship semifinals of 
its own tournament. 
</P>
<P>
But once there, the Eagles ran head-on into Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade, which had only to beat undermanned Camp Kilpatrick to reach the 
semifinals, were jolted back to reality Friday night in an 87-53 loss. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley (8-4) meets Fairfax, a 39-28 winner over Santa Monica, tonight at 
7:30 p.m. for the tournament championship. Chaminade (5-5) plays Santa Monica 
at 6 p.m. for third place. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles, who drew a first-round bye before thumping Camp Kilpatrick by 45 
points, hung in against Simi Valley for a quarter. Chaminade fell behind, 7-0, 
but rallied to tie the score, 9-9. Steve Carnes hit a three-point basket while 
falling out of bounds to give Simi Valley a 12-9 lead after one period. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we played a great first quarter," Chaminade Coach Mike Lynn said. 
"After that, they just had too many horses." 
</P>
<P>
Chaminade was down, 18-16, early in the second period when Simi Valley went on 
a 16-3 run to close the half. Carnes, the only player remaining from Simi 
Valley's 1987-88 Southern Section 4-A Division championship team, had seven 
points, including a three-point basket, to key the blitz. 
</P>
<P>
"We got fatigued in the second quarter and they scored a whole bunch of points. 
That just took us out of it," Lynn said. "We probably should have been much 
more deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
"They had kids coming off the bench who were very good athletes. There was no 
drop-off when they came in." 
</P>
<P>
Carnes, suffering from the flu, led all scorers with 22 points and had seven 
rebounds. Mike Wawryk (16 points and eight rebounds), Kenny Hood (15 points and 
10 rebounds) and Tim Joqua (13 points) also scored in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers outrebounded Chaminade, 46-31, and held the Eagles to 30% 
field-goal shooting -- 22% in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley shot 58% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time," Simi Valley Coach Dean Bradshaw said. "We're a team with 
high expectations, but we've been disappointed with ourselves until the last 
couple of ball games. It's weird. we could never pinpoint what was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Mirkovich led Chaminade with 16 points and seven rebounds, and Colin 
Havert added 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
In another tournament game: 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills 65, Crossroads 48 -- Osiris Nalls scored 19 points to lead 
Granada Hills (7-6) into the consolation final today at 4:30 p.m. against 
Marshall, a 77-30 winner over Camp Kilpatrick. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills led, 23-22, at halftime, but opened a nine-point margin after 
three periods before blowing out Crossroads with a 27-point fourth quarter. 
Adrian Sellers (12 points), Sagy Koren (11) and Aaron Lattimore (10) also 
scored in double figures.

CAMARILLO TAKES ITS TIME EN ROUTE TO 48-38 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Usually, the Camarillo High boys' basketball team is an up-tempo scoring 
machine. However, the absence of four of his top eight players has forced Coach 
John Harbour to give the Scorpions a strange new look. 
</P>
<P>
Even though it didn't look like the Camarillo of old, the slow-down, 
ball-control offensive scheme worked well Friday night as the Scorpions claimed 
third place in the Ventura tournament with a 48-38 victory over Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park (6-5) forced Camarillo's hand with a tight, match-up zone defense 
and a distinct height advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The game was close most of the way, Camarillo (9-3) holding a tenuous 33-31 
lead at the start of the fourth quarter. Newbury Park Coach Greg Ropes switched 
to a man-to-man defense at that point, allowing Camarillo guard David Harbour 
to break loose for 13 of his game-high 28 points to help the Scorpions outscore 
the Panthers, 15-7, in the final eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"Our players were really disciplined, and they showed a lot of self-sacrifice," 
John Harbour said. Six-foot-six center Kevin Loveall did most of the damage for 
Newbury Park, scoring 15 points and grabbing 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The slow-down offense also forced Camarillo to be selective with its shot 
attempts. The Scorpions shot 59% from the field in the first half and 47% for 
the game. Newbury Park shot only 30%. 
</P>
<P>
In another tournament game: 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks 65, Ventura 62 -- The Lancers used a 12-6 run in the fourth 
quarter to secure the consolation championship. Guard Scott Peterson scored 
eight of his 16 points in the period for Thousand Oaks (6-5). 
</P>
<P>
Center Mike Sandlin had a team-high 17 points for Thousand Oaks and forward 
Chris Loll added 12. Forward Dusty Lysobey had seven points and 10 rebounds.

<P>
Kennedy High scored 10 unanswered points to open the second quarter en route to 
a 63-49 victory over Grant on Friday night in the championship game of the 
Birmingham tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars (6-5), who trailed by one after one period, were led by guard 
Garret Anderson, who finished with a game-high 29 points. Anderson scored from 
all over the court and made three three-point baskets in the second quarter 
when Kennedy outscored Grant, 20-12, for a 35-28 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Lancer forward Rene de la Hoya led the Lancers (10-3) with 22 points. Teammate 
Keith Weinstein got in early foul trouble and was held to only eight points, 
six in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Despite scoring only three points in the first four minutes of the game, Grant 
led, 16-15, at the end of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's 12 second-quarter points matched Grant's total for the period. De la 
Hoya scored half of his team's total in the period to keep the game close. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by eight as the final period opened, the Lancers cut the lead to six 
on a three-point shot by de la Hoya. 
</P>

CAL LUTHERAN LOSES 13TH IN A ROW AS GRAHAM SCORES 29 FOR STANISLAUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jeff deLaveaga and Mike Demeter combined for 55 points for Cal Lutheran, but 
once again it wasn't enough as Cal State Stanislaus defeated the Kingsmen, 
99-86, Friday in a nonconference game at Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the 13th without a victory for Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
DeLaveaga pulled Cal Lutheran to within 65-62 with five minutes left on a short 
jump shot but Stanislaus (7-5) scored 14 of the next 20 points to take an 81-71 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
The lead grew to 16 points with two minutes left before deLaveaga connected on 
consecutive three-point shots to cut the lead to 10. But the Kingsmen allowed 
Shawn Graham to score off two offensive rebounds to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Graham made eight of 10 shots in the second half and scored 19 of his 29 points 
after intermission. The Stanislaus center was guarded loosely by Demeter, who 
picked up his fourth foul early in second half but remained in the game for 
offensive purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Demeter scored a season-high 27 points, 15 in the first half, and grabbed seven 
rebounds.

</P>

SAN DIEGO JAZZ SCENE THRIVED DURING EIGHTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the live music scene experienced as many mood swings as a John Coltrane 
solo, jazz in the area generally enjoyed a steady crescendo during the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
The decade closes on several sweet notes: 
</P>
<P>
The 10th annual San Diego Thanksgiving Dixieland Jazz Festival drew 15,000 
people to the Town &amp; Country Hotel this year. 
</P>
<P>
* San Diego was selected as the site of this year's National Assn. of Jazz 
Educators convention, held at the Town &amp; Country Hotel last January. 
</P>
<P>
* Such local light-jazz acts as Fattburger, Checkfield, Spencer Nilsen and 
Hollis Gentry's Neon have gained national attention. 
</P>
<P>
* Jazz fan Bill Muchnic (who died last month) began his annual "Jazz Party" in 
1988, and his widow, Beverly, will continue the tradition in 1990 at the 
downtown Marriott Hotel. The 1989 version brought 500 San Diegans out to hear a 
slate of top traditional jazz players engaged in three days of jam sessions. 
</P>
<P>
* Internationally known jazz musicians Mundell Lowe, Barney Kessel and James 
Moody moved to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
* In 1988, jazz buff Jude Hibler began publishing The Jazz Link, the only local 
publication devoted entirely to jazz. The 20-page, 15,000-circulation monthly 
has featured occasional guest articles by such prominent jazz critics as 
Stanley Dance and Leonard Feather. 
</P>
<P>
* KIFM (98.1) and light jazz guru Art Good built a sizable audience for "Lites 
Out Jazz." Purists denounce it as "Jacuzzi jazz," the stuff of quiche eaters, 
but at least it's an entry point to the broader world of the genre. Bowing to 
pressure from local fans of straight-ahead sounds, KIFM added the "Mainly 
Mainstream" show Sunday nights. 
</P>
<P>
* Elario's continued to book nationally known jazz acts, and many of them were 
featured on KPBS-TV's "Club Date" series. 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite all the good signs, the decade ends with bluesy undercurrents. 
</P>
<P>
After peaking in 1984, when it presented 25 jazz concerts throughout the year, 
the San Diego Jazz Festival has tapered activities as founder Rob Hagey has 
made the transition from idealistic, young jazz maverick to middle-aged family 
man, with a parallel shift in priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Without Hagey as one-man promoter, public-relations machine and all-around jazz 
Pied Piper, San Diego played host to fewer and fewer shows by such mainstream 
and cutting-edge artists as Dizzy Gillespie, Jon Hendricks, Jack DeJohnette, 
Ronald Shannon Jackson, Ornette Coleman, Oliver Lake, Charles Lloyd, James 
Newton and Henry Threadgill, all of whom appeared here under the festival's 
aegis. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the festival was responsible for presenting drummers Tony Williams, 
Art Blakey and Max Roach, but their shows proved that San Diegans still have a 
limited appetite for serious jazz. Each drew about 250 people. 
</P>
<P>
To Hagey's chagrin, the rival San Diego Jazz Society, with a name confusingly 
similar to Hagey's group, received $12,000 in city arts money this year, while 
the festival applied late and, as a consequence, received zilch. 
</P>
<P>
On the club scene, Elario's, atop and subsidized by the Summer House Inn in La 
Jolla, thrived in the '80s. The club presented such legends as Cedar Walton, 
Dizzy Gillespie, Barney Kessel, Tal Farlow, Joe Pass, Clifford Jordan, Jimmy 
Witherspoon and many others. 
</P>
<P>
Other clubs had a tough time. 
</P>
<P>
The Crossroads downtown, Our Place in Hillcrest, the Blue Parrot in La Jolla, 
the Bella Via in Cardiff and the Swan Song in Pacific Beach were among those 
that didn't survive the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, owners of Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach, which has presented 
several excellent local and national acts, decided to close, at least 
temporarily, after losing bundles of money. Some observers believe the club's 
jazz days are over. 
</P>
<P>
On a brighter note, Croce's in downtown San Diego, owned by singer Jim Croce's 
widow, Ingrid, has become the single most active source of live local jazz, 
presenting shows several times a day seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
"That's been a highlight," acknowledged San Diego sax man Joe Marillo. "They've 
kept going with acoustic jazz, and it's working out." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest jazz success story, at least commercially, came in radio, 
with the emergence of KIFM and its light-jazz format. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneered by disc jockey Good, who left for a brief stint with the short-lived 
"Wave" station before signing a new deal with KIFM earlier this year, the music 
has won over large numbers of fans since its debut in 1982. This is evidenced 
by the huge local turnout for musicians who anchor KIFM's play list. 
</P>
<P>
The station's New Year's Eve shows typically sell out. Promoter Kenny 
Weissberg's Humphrey's by the Bay outdoor concerts last summer attracted 6,000 
fans for light jazz saxophonist Kenny G over three nights, 4,864 for Hiroshima, 
4,000 for guitarist/singer George Benson and 2,900 for Spyro Gyra. 
</P>
<P>
For years, KIFM's management didn't feel a need to educate listeners about the 
earlier history of jazz, even though many light jazz players readily 
acknowledge jazz artists of the '30s, '40s and '50s as important role models. 
Last May, the station added "Mainly Mainstream," two-and-a-half hours of 
straight ahead jazz on Sunday nights. 
</P>
<P>
Some people believe KIFM's success with light jazz will lure new listeners to 
older forms of the music, but purists like Hagey aren't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy they're there, but I don't think their emergence has helped 
jazz as much as they might feel it has," he said. Hagey remembers when he went 
to Bruce Walton, KIFM's general manager, in 1983, with a proposal for the 
station to get involved with Hagey's festival of mainstream and avant garde 
jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"His response was, 'Great, Rob, but we've got Chuck Mangione on Labor Day 
weekend. In all honesty, that's probably more important to our audience.' As 
much as I hated the comment, it was probably very true of the time. And I don't 
think that has changed," Hagey said. 
</P>
<P>
Walton agreed that it can be hard to get light jazz listeners to cross over to 
traditional jazz. It could be even harder to draw traditional purists to KIFM, 
but Walton thinks it can be done. 
</P>
<P>
While KIFM made inroads with the David Benoits and Kenny Gs of the music world, 
KSDS-FM (88.3) at San Diego City College continued its dedication to 
traditional jazz in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
The "Jazz Live" series presented top local players in live performances 
broadcast over the air. The station has built a stable of wonderful jazz 
programs, including "Instrumental Women," "Percussive Profiles," "Le Jazz Club" 
and a Friday night countdown of top jazz albums. 
</P>
<P>
While its audience is limited by its low power, many San Diegans still don't 
realize they can receive the signal via local cable television systems.

POP MUSIC IN SAN DIEGO RODE A WAVE OF SAMENESS DURING DECADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS K. ARNOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1849, French writer Alphonse Karr observed, "The more things change, the 
more they remain the same." 
</P>
<P>
A century and a half later, the San Diego pop-music scene is a perfect case in 
point: Over the last decade, there have been plenty of changes, but for the 
most part, things are still very much the same. 
</P>
<P>
* Despite the international success of such hometown heroes as the Beat 
Farmers, Ratt, and Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper, local bands that play original 
music still have trouble finding nightclub work. 
</P>
<P>
"Things have actually gotten worse," said Buddy Blue, singer-guitarist of local 
blue-eyed soulsters the Jacks. "When the decade began, the Top 40 bands got all 
the action, and as if that wasn't vile enough, the end of the decade sees 
canned music virtually eliminating live music altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gotten to the point where there's no incentive, no reason, to start a 
band in San Diego, original or otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
* Despite the fact that San Diego's population has grown from 696,000 to more 
than 1 million, making it the sixth-largest city in the United States, the 
music industry continues to view the region as a suburb of Los Angeles, an 
unnecessary pit stop for touring superstars. Just this year, prominent no-shows 
included the Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney and the Jefferson Airplane. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of big artists who are playing a limited number of dates in the U.S. 
still feel they can accomplish what they want to, media-wise, in California by 
playing San Francisco and Los Angeles," said local concert promoter Bill Silva. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a general feeling that by playing San Francisco, they can take care of 
Northern California, and by playing Los Angeles, they can take care of Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
* Despite a significant increase in concert activity and growing mainstream 
acceptance -- concerts started popping up in all sorts of unlikely places, from 
shopping malls to the San Diego Wild Animal Park and, briefly, Sea World -- pop 
music is still considered a cultural outlaw by the powers-that-be. 
</P>
<P>
"This town is very prejudiced, very anti-rock 'n' roll," said Country Dick 
Montana of the Beat Farmers. "They'll channel millions of taxpayer dollars into 
the symphony and the Soviet Arts Festival, and then go out of their way to make 
it nearly impossible for any rock 'n' roll function to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Still, there were plenty of high hopes when the decade began, particularly on 
the home-grown front. The local pop scene was more vibrant than ever. 
Original-music bands like the Penetrators, DFX2, and the Rick Elias Band 
routinely attracted standing-room-only crowds to the half-dozen or so 
nightclubs where Top 40 cover tunes were taboo, including the Skeleton Club and 
the Zebra Club downtown, the Spirit in Bay Park, and the Rodeo in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
There was even a monthly magazine, Kicks, that was devoted to covering this 
scene through band profiles, performance reviews and club reports. 
</P>
<P>
Harlan Schiffman recalls being so impressed by what he saw, by what he heard, 
during his frequent visits to the Skeleton Club, that he promptly began 
promoting shows and managing local bands himself. 
</P>
<P>
"It was such a phenomenon, this music scene generated by the clubs and the 
bands, that it just seduced me," Schiffman said. "I'd never seen anything like 
it before -- it was almost like all the things we had been reading about the 
music scenes in London and New York over the last five years were now happening 
right here in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Within a year, however, it was pretty much over. The crowds went first, then 
the clubs. Kicks was sold and soon folded; most of the bands broke up, switched 
to Top 40 covers or fled to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything just seemed to dry up, all at once," recalled Blue, of the Jacks. 
"People stopped coming out for shows, the clubs changed over to different 
formats, and promising bands such as the Penetrators and DFX2 that really 
seemed ready to make a move broke up before anything had a chance to happen for 
them, while others either turned into Top 40 . . . or moved to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Still, a few local original-music bands persevered, and as the 1980s 
progressed, many of them got signed by national labels: the Puppies to Stiff 
America, the Beat Farmers to Rhino and then to MCA/Curb, Mojo Nixon and Skid 
Roper to Enigma, Ratt to Enigma and then to Atlantic, Rough Cutt to Warner 
Brothers, the Jacks to Rounder, Robbie Vaughn and the Shadows to Island, and, 
most recently, the Voices to MCA. 
</P>
<P>
But almost all of these bands have since been dropped by their respective 
labels, and of the ones that haven't, only the Beat Farmers, Mojo Nixon and 
Skid Roper, and Ratt have made a name for themselves outside San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, the Beat Farmers have yet to amass more than a cult following, and 
Nixon is known more for his wacky promos on MTV than for his music. 
</P>
<P>
Only Ratt has managed to score several hit albums and singles, but the 
heavy-metal group's four members make a point of disavowing their San Diego 
roots whenever they're interviewed in the rock press or on TV. That's probably 
because they found fortune and fame only after moving to Los Angeles in 1984. 
They'd apparently like to forget their earlier years of struggling in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The disintegration of the San Diego pop-music scene in the early 1980s -- and 
its continued failure to rebuild itself -- is no mystery. 
</P>
<P>
If you look at cities that have long been known for their strong, vibrant music 
scenes -- like London, New York, Detroit and Kansas City -- you'll discover a 
pattern: A majority of their citizens are natives, with a fierce sense of 
hometown pride that is conspicuously absent in San Diego, where natives are in 
the minority. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, most of these cities are aging metropolises with little to offer 
in the way of recreation. Accordingly, leisure activities tend to revolve 
around night life. In San Diego, however, the beaches, the bays, the mountains 
and deserts offer inviting alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego is just not an original-music, rock 'n' roll town," said Mojo Nixon. 
"There's no history of it here as there is in, say, Detroit, where people can 
look back all the way to the 1960s and say, oh, these are our bands. 
</P>
<P>
"There's also no college or listener-sponsored radio station that caters to the 
local music scene as there is in a lot of towns -- Memphis, for one. And 
there's absolutely no support from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"In Austin, Tex., the City Council is even paying their bands to go to New York 
and play, whereas in San Diego, the powers-that-be want everything to be nice 
and safe and easy." 
</P>
<P>
The only real bright spot on the local music set is the the Street Scene, which 
each year since 1984 has provided badly needed exposure for a handful of 
promising San Diego bands. 
</P>
<P>
"The Street Scene is a big boon for San Diego," Blue said. "It's a major event, 
and the fact that the promoter (Rob Hagey) always includes at least one or two 
local bands in the lineup is a very good thing for this town." 
</P>
<P>
Concert-wise, San Diego had plenty to be grateful for in the 1980s. In 1982 
came the first Concerts by the Bay series at Humphrey's on Shelter Island, 
which went from just seven shows in the summer of 1982 to nearly 50 in the 
summer of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1983, local radio station XTRA-FM (91X) switched from a traditional 
album-oriented rock (AOR) format to alternative new music. The move, according 
to promoter Silva, "gave the San Diego concert market a whole new bent on life. 
It created an audience for alternative bands that never existed before." 
</P>
<P>
And by the time the decade was half over, both the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa and 
the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach had changed their focus from local bands to 
concerts by national acts. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, then, the decade has seen a significant increase in the number 
of concerts, particularly by club-level and alternative-music acts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing a lot of shows we never would have seen before, primarily because 
there was no place to see them, or no audience for them," promoter-manager 
Schiffman said. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the decade also saw its share of downs: police crackdowns on punk-rock 
shows, a lack of civic funding for the Street Scene, brawls at rap concerts, 
and -- most notably -- the closure of San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium to pop 
shows after the 1982 Who concert, during which the grass playing field was 
severely damaged by dancing revelers. 
</P>
<P>
The ban was finally lifted this year -- ironically, in time for the Who's 
return last August -- but its legacy persists. 
</P>
<P>
"To be able to lure the upper-end artists, you really need a major outdoor 
concert facility," Silva said. "We haven't had one for much of the decade, and 
it's going to take a lot of hard work to get the word out before we even have a 
chance to be competitive with Los Angeles and other large markets."

MAILMAN FACES 3 FELONY COUNTS IN DOG'S SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office filed three felony charges 
Friday against a Postal Service mail carrier who allegedly shot and killed a 
dog in Arleta because the dog had bitten him earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd Bertran Sterling, 34, was charged with carrying a concealed weapon, using 
a firearm in a grossly negligent manner and cruelty to animals, with the 
special allegation that he used a firearm. He was not immediately arrested, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, debate over the incident continued to build as residents of 
Sterling's postal route rallied to his defense, praising him as an excellent 
mail carrier and saying the dog was vicious and its owners had let the animal 
run loose. 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Brody, 27, had told police that Sterling "freaked out" and shot her 
2-year-old mixed-breed German shepherd, Skippy, just as Brody emerged from the 
house Tuesday to give the mail carrier a bottle of vodka as a Christmas 
present. 
</P>
<P>
Brody said the dog was not menacing Sterling at the time, but the mailman told 
police afterward that the animal had bitten him earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Felony charges were brought against Sterling because he was recently convicted 
of carrying a loaded firearm in a public place, and because he had also been 
convicted of misdemeanor spousal abuse in 1982, Deputy Dist. Atty. Myron 
Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all counts, Sterling faces a maximum sentence of 5 years and 8 
months in state prison, Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
No records were available on Sterling's spousal abuse conviction. According to 
court documents, he was still on two years' probation after pleading no contest 
in San Fernando Municipal Court in December, 1988, to a charge of carrying a 
loaded .44 magnum revolver in his car on his way home from a firing range. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Adams, 30, who lives near the Brody house, said she was "shocked" and 
"flabbergasted" that Sterling -- who has been placed on leave by the Postal 
Service while federal authorities investigate -- may go to prison. 
</P>
<P>
Adams, who also has a German shepherd, called Sterling a "sweet, wonderful 
man," a "good Christian" and "gentle as a lamb." Other neighbors also praised 
Sterling as a dedicated mail carrier and a kind person, who often took time to 
chat with people on his route. Several, including Adams, said they had come to 
consider him a good friend. 
</P>
<P>
Skippy, however, was known around the neighborhood as a "vicious dog," Adams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Vera Kuppers, who is in her 60s, blamed the Brodys for Skippy's death, saying 
that "people think that just because their dog loves them or is good to them, 
it's OK for them to run around at any time. But a dog can turn on a stranger 
any time." 
</P>
<P>
Brody's sister, Debbie Roedel, 15, said that family members tried to keep 
Skippy at home but the dog had learned to unlatch the door of the house. She 
said he frequently ran toward people barking, but "that was his way of 
playing." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes he would run towards little kids and bark, but his tail was always 
wagging," Debbie said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REMAPPING SUIT WILL GO TO TRIAL, ANTONOVICH 
SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said Friday that he expects a 
voting rights suit filed by Latino activists against the county to go to trial 
next week, but he did not rule out a settlement once the trial begins. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative Republican made his statement after a taping of KCBS' 
"Newsmakers," where he and Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) 
predicted that reapportionment will be a dominant political topic of the coming 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich's opposition to a pretrial settlement in the redistricting suit, 
along with similar sentiments expressed by fellow Republicans Pete Schabarum 
and Deane Dana, would appear to rule out a compromise before the trial begins 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The three supervisors compose the board's conservative majority, although Dana 
broke ranks before turning down a counterproposal by the Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund, one of the plaintiffs in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich said he would oppose any settlement that would force the county to 
pay legal fees to the American Civil Liberties Union, which has joined MALDEF 
in its suit.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 1 TEEN KILLED, 1 WOUNDED IN DRIVE-BY 
SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 15-year-old boy was killed and another youth was injured in a drive-by 
shooting by gang members early Friday in Wilmington, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel Franquez of Harbor City died at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in 
Harbor City at 2:08 a.m., 50 minutes after he was shot while riding with 
friends on Anaheim Street, Los Angeles Police Detective Patrick Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
Another 15-year-old from Harbor City, Ruben Alcala, was shot in the arm and was 
scheduled to undergo surgery at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-agers and three other youths were driving home from a friend's house 
in Long Beach when another car pulled alongside near the intersection of 
Anaheim Street and Eubank Avenue. Two men in the other car fired "numerous" 
shots, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that they have no suspects in the shooting but that they believe 
both the victims and their attackers are gang members.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: REPORT ON DAM REPAIRS NOT NEEDED, OFFICIAL 
SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state's chief expert on dam safety says an environmental impact report is 
unnecessary for repair work at the leaking Garvey Reservoir in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park officials had requested that the state conduct extensive 
geological and environmental studies on the impact of repairs on two large 
cracks in the reservoir. The damage, discovered in the last month, had 
contributed to flooding around nearby homes and prompted the closure and 
draining of the reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
Some local residents have become so upset that they are demanding permanent 
closure of the 150-acre facility, which serves as a critical link in the supply 
system of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
But Vernon H. Persson, chief of the Division of Dam Safety in the state 
Department of Water Resources, informed the city in a Dec. 12 letter that "the 
investigation and anticipated repairs (are) categorically exempt" from 
environmental impact requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the water district said Friday that the reservoir is 
unlikely to be reopened by the dry season next summer. "That means we could 
have some water delivery problems. But we're not going to rush the reservoir 
back into service at the risk it will seep again," Jay Malinowski said.

GUARD DUTY BEGINS ON THE ROSE PARADE ROUTE

By noon Friday, USC senior David Dunn was getting a little bleary-eyed. 
</P>
<P>
He had already been through one Tom Clancy novel and was halfway into his 
second. And with three days left until the 101st Tournament of Roses Parade, 
Dunn said he might as well have brought all of the author's works. 
</P>
<P>
Perched on top of a wooden stepladder on the corner of Orange Grove Boulevard 
and Del Rosa Drive in Pasadena, the 25-year-old Kappa Alpha fraternity member 
was charged with a most important duty: guarding a half-block-long patch of 
grass between two palms, where 200 parade-goers will plant themselves early New 
Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Dunn was taking the job seriously. He was getting paid for it: a hefty $500. 
</P>
<P>
"I brought a generator, my TV, my stereo with me," Dunn said, zipping up his 
ski jacket and wrapping a down blanket around his legs. "This is my first year 
to do this." 
</P>
<P>
But he was not the first one out there. A block away, Pasadena resident Donna 
Matiko claimed that since Tuesday morning her group had staked out the east 
side of Orange Grove, near Colorado Boulevard. Matiko and Darren Schwartz, a 
friend from Saskatchewan, Canada, had just reported for their four-hour shift. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the prime spot. This is the best," Matiko gloated. "This is where the 
television cameras will be, right there on the corner. So all the floats will 
face this way." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, recreational vehicles were trickling into Brookside Park across from 
the Rose Bowl, their occupants ready for a weekend of pregame partying. And 
people were lining up across from the stadium, waiting to get a glimpse of the 
almost-finished parade floats. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the early birds who made themselves comfortable along the parade route 
were planning to enjoy the choicest curbside seats themselves. Highland Park 
residents Paul Ho, 15, and Krista Granger, 18, were saving space for 80 folding 
chairs that their church, Hermon Free Methodist, has sold at $25 a seat. But 
Paul and Krista said they would do something else on New Year's. 
</P>
<P>
Sylmar resident Jim Hoelscher, who entertained himself with a bag of potato 
chips and a sports car catalogue while saving spots for 60 friends and 
acquaintances, said he will be curled up on a sofa at home come Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little too cold out here," he said. "I'll probably watch the parade on 
TV this time."

Los Angeles police detectives released videotape photographs on Friday that 
showed two men wanted for questioning in connection with the daring daylight 
theft of more than $1 million in gold from a chain wholesaler in the downtown 
jewelry district. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. Robert E. Kurth emphasized that the two men shown in the fuzzy 
videotape footage are not necessarily suspects in Wednesday's robbery of the 
Rope Mine Jewelry Corp. at 610 S. Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"I really need to stress that the images in the video may well be two downtown 
businessmen," said Kurth, head of detectives at LAPD's Central Division. "I 
just need to talk to them to eliminate them (as suspects). . . . They may have 
information that would help me solve this robbery." 
</P>
<P>
Kurth said the two shop owners and their five employees were not able to 
positively identify either man pictured as the bandits clad in sport coats who 
robbed them shortly after 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The theft of more than 100 pounds of gold dust, gold bars and gold chains was 
one of the biggest heists ever in the nation's second-largest jewelry district. 
On Friday, Lloyd's of London offered a $75,000 reward for information leading 
to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the robbery, as well as 
the recovery of the gold, said Harold Smith, president of Smith International 
Adjusters Inc. and representative for Lloyd's in this case.

INCIDENT PROBED AT LONG BEACH AIRPORT; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITY: TWO INTRUDERS ENTER A RESTRICTED AREA. ONE BOARDS A JUST-ARRIVED 
PLANE. THE FAA IS LOOKING INTO POSSIBLE SAFETY LAPSES.

The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday that it will investigate 
possible security lapses at Long Beach Airport after two men acting 
suspiciously got onto the Tarmac and one made it aboard an Alaska Airlines jet 
as passengers were leaving. 
</P>
<P>
The McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft was grounded temporarily Thursday evening 
and searched by police and by bomb-sniffing dogs, but nothing was found, 
authorities said. Both men fled before airport security officers arrived. 
</P>
<P>
An Alaska Airlines spokesman said 55 passengers who were to have boarded the 
plane for a flight to Oakland and Seattle were placed on another scheduled 
flight at 7:15 p.m. The grounded aircraft, which had been taken to a remote 
area of the airfield, was back in service Friday morning, said Greg Witter, 
manager of media relations for the Seattle-based carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Witter emphasized that the 135-seat plane was searched only as a routine 
precautionary measure, and that no threat had been received or suspicious 
object seen. 
</P>
<P>
Witter said the incident began about 5:45 p.m. Thursday, when an Alaska 
Airlines employee noticed two men standing in a restricted area on the Tarmac 
near Flight 170, which had arrived from San Jose about 20 minutes earlier. When 
asked what they were doing, the men told a flight attendant that they worked 
there, presumably referring to the airport, Witter said. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, an Alaska Airlines gate attendant approached them as one of the 
men bolted up the stairs to the waiting aircraft. The man on the ground said 
his companion was looking for something he had left behind on the plane. Again 
he indicated that he worked at the airport, but declined to produce 
identification and finally walked away. 
</P>
<P>
Aboard the plane, where a stewardess was helping some elderly passengers leave, 
the second man told flight attendants he had left something behind, Witter 
said. When questioned again, the man bolted out of the plane and into the 
terminal, eluding pursuing flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just enough suspicious activity . . . that airline personnel felt it 
necessary to check the plane to see if there was a problem," said Long Beach 
Police Lt. Greg Whinery, whose department was notified of the incident about 6 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach officers searched the plane twice without results, according to 
Whinery. Then members of the Los Angeles County sheriff's bomb squad and 
specially trained dogs borrowed from the Los Angeles Police Department 
conducted a third uneventful search before the plane was cleared. 
</P>
<P>
The men, described as being of average height and build and in their early to 
mid-20s, were never found, Whinery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Elly Brekke said the incident was 
reported to the FAA as required, and that the agency will conduct a routine 
investigation of airport and airline security procedures. 
</P>
<P>
If lapses in security or violations of federal aviation regulations are found, 
Brekke said, the airport and the airline could face fines of $10,000.

FOR GRATEFUL DEAD FAN, IT WAS A FINAL CONCERT; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATIONS: COLLEGE SOPHOMORE DIED IN POLICE CUSTODY. OFFICIALS ARE TRYING 
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WENT WRONG.

<P>
As a sophomore at UC Santa Barbara, Patrick Shanahan loved to blast his stereo 
system with records of Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd and his favorite group, the 
Grateful Dead. He often grumbled when the dormitory adviser asked him to turn 
it down, his friend Robert Jarrett recalled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
It was Shanahan's loyalty to the Dead that drew him and Jarrett to the group's 
concert on Dec. 10 at the Forum in Inglewood. It was there, after seeing his 
24th Grateful Dead performance, that Shanahan died in the custody of Inglewood 
police. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, an autopsy disclosed that the 19-year-old Fountain Valley youth 
died from neck injuries suffered as he struggled with officers. Inglewood 
police had acknowledged in a police report that they used a chokehold to 
control Shanahan; the family's lawyer, Lawrence Trygstad, accused the police 
Friday of using "excessive force." 
</P>
<P>
The case is under investigation by police and the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrett described Shanahan as a teen-ager disillusioned with the pollution and 
hubbub of Southern California. He had recently learned to surf and talked of 
changing his UC Santa Barbara college major from business to forestry. 
</P>
<P>
While a police report released Friday depicted Shanahan as struggling so hard 
that officers had to use a chokehold to subdue him, Jarrett and others who knew 
the Grateful Dead fan described him as simply a good-hearted achiever who 
questioned authority. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched him grow up and he called me Uncle Joe," said Joseph Panarese, a 
teacher at Goffstown High School in New Hampshire, which Shanahan attended 
before transferring to Fountain Valley High School. "He was the typical 
All-American teen-ager. He was was very bright, he did well in school and he 
enjoyed life." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Kasler, principal of Fountain Valley High, said Shanahan was a B-plus 
student who excelled in languages and competed on the school wrestling team for 
two years. He graduated with honors in 1988 after attending the school for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
"It is such a tragedy for someone so young and with so much potential to die 
like that," Kasler said. "We feel for the family. It's a shame. It's a 
tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Jarrett, whose mother lives in Pomona, said he spent the night at the Shanahan 
home in Fountain Valley the night before the concert and remembers staying up 
late that night, talking with Shanahan and his parents about what the two 
teen-agers were going to do with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Jarrett said, he and Shanahan arrived at the Forum several hours 
before the concert began. They shopped for Christmas presents at makeshift 
booths set up by Grateful Dead fans in the parking lot across the street from 
the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Once the concert started, they spent the first hour together, Jarrett said. But 
then they became separated. When Shanahan returned from intermission, Jarrett 
said, he appeared "worried, bugged out." Jarrett said he did not suspect at the 
time that Shanahan might have taken drugs. 
</P>
<P>
As they danced in an aisle during the second half of the concert, Shanahan 
suddenly walked away from his friend without explanation. Jarrett followed. 
Shanahan first headed down toward the stage, then turned and headed up the 
aisle toward an exit, Jarrett said. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan pushed Jarrett away from him at one point, Jarrett said, unresponsive 
to his friend's questions about what was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"He was waving his hands," Jarrett said. "He didn't say anything. I thought he 
was mad at me and that he wanted to be on his own." 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan, dressed in a tie-dyed shirt, jeans and white tennis shoes, walked 
off. The two friends did not see each other again. 
</P>
<P>
A police report of the incident said an officer on patrol after the concert 
spotted Shanahan standing rigid with a blank stare on his face. He did not 
respond to questions and suddenly dropped to his knees, yelling and laughing to 
himself, the officer reported. 
</P>
<P>
When Shanahan resisted the officer's efforts to handcuff him, police said, 
backup officers were called. 
</P>
<P>
After the officers wrestled Shanahan to the ground, police said, he broke free. 
One of the officers then "placed him in a carotid control hold," or chokehold, 
the police report says. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan continued to struggle as three officers lay on top of him and others 
put on leg restraints. He stopped struggling but continued yelling, the report 
said. It was when police were en route to the police station -- with Shanahan 
in the back seat -- that they noticed he had stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
They changed course and took him to nearby Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital, 
where he was declared dead. 
</P>
<P>
The autopsy report released Thursday said Shanahan died from "compression of 
the neck during restraint." Contributing factors in the death were listed as 
"multiple injuries and acute LSD intoxication." 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan's family was en route to Orange County on Friday from New Hampshire, 
where they had buried Shanahan the week before. They have hired attorney 
Trygstad and pathologist Irving Root to sort out the details. 
</P>
<P>
Trygstad said his investigation showed that Shanahan's trachea had reportedly 
been crushed during the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Trygstad said he has spoken to about 20 witnesses to the arrest, many of whom 
called him after reading a flyer distributed at a series of Grateful Dead 
concerts in Oakland by an area resident concerned about the death. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood police refused to comment on the matter Friday, but the department 
previously has denied using excessive force against Shanahan. Detectives are 
investigating Shanahan's death, while internal investigators look at the police 
response. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the Los Angeles Police Department banned the use of carotid control 
holds because authorities were concerned about the possibility of injuries 
resulting from them.

RAP'S RISE PARALLELS HISTORY OF EARLY ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Given the many musical and sociological parallels between rap and early rock, 
it's remarkable that rap -- the dominant new pop sound of the '80s -- was long 
viewed as the enemy by much of the rock community. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the suspicion was conditioning. Rock radio stations in the 
mid-1970s rarely played records by black musicians because -- the theory went 
-- their audience would mistake the records as disco at a time when an intense 
rock-vs.-disco war was raging. 
</P>
<P>
The practice was absurd -- based on thinking that underestimated the 
intelligence of the rock listener and treated black music as a stereotype. This 
virtual boycott of black artists taught a generation of fans -- mostly white -- 
to reject records by any black musician who courted a rock audience. 
</P>
<P>
The first taste of rap for most pop fans was the Sugarhill Gang's 1979 hit 
"Rapper's Delight," a lightweight novelty that left rock fans thinking of rap 
as little more than an offbeat cousin of the disco trend that was driving rock 
off Top 40 radio. 
</P>
<P>
What outsiders didn't realize in the early '80s was that rap music had a much 
stronger foundation than "Rapper's Delight" suggested. Just as '50s teen-agers, 
black and white, embraced rock as a means of self-identity and expression, 
urban black teens in the early '80s adopted rap as a grass-roots way to express 
the aspirations and frustrations that were being ignored in a black music world 
as stagnant as the pop-rock mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
But few rock fans saw this link in the early days of rap. The music -- once 
defined as rhythmic talking over a funk beat -- sounded alien. The vocals were 
recited rather than sung, and the backing tracks relied on a steady, aggressive 
rhythm with little of the guitar and drum sounds of rock. 
</P>
<P>
The creative breakthrough for this New York-centered style was Grandmaster 
Flash &amp; the Furious Five's "The Message." The stark 1982 tale of ghetto 
alienation illustrated that rap could be a powerful and passionate forum. 
</P>
<P>
While "The Message" was a critical favorite, it didn't dent the pop 
consciousness. The record that did the most to make rap welcome in the pop-rock 
community was Run-DMC's 1986 remake of "Walk This Way," the old Aerosmith hit. 
</P>
<P>
Progress since then has been dramatic -- an explosion of energy and imagination 
that has established rap as arguably the most vital new street-oriented sound 
in pop since the beginning of rock itself. While New York, which pioneered rap, 
continues to produce worthy new stars, the most compelling movements in rap at 
the decade's end are centered in Los Angeles -- in the humor and spunk of the 
Delicious Vinyl stable of artists, including Tone Loc and Young M.C., and in 
the urban gang imagery of N.W.A and Ice-T. 
</P>
<P>
Though there is a strong anti-drug, pro-education message in much rap, there 
are also references in some records that are as troubling as street rage itself 
-- moments tarnished by misogynistic, anti-gay, anti-police and racist 
attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
When these issues are raised, the rap artists involved argue that the 
viewpoints in the songs -- such as the aggressive gang imagery of N.W.A -- are 
reflections of the reality of street life and attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Rap's future is one of the most intriguing questions facing pop in the '90s. 
Can the raw music form maintain its street vitality in the face of growing 
commercial acceptance, or will it become a "faceless" victim of its own success 
-- much as rock did in the first half of the '70s? Also, can it find a way to 
express social anger without resorting to social slander?

RAP MANIFESTO LEADS THE LIST OF '80S SINGLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who imagined seven years ago that a New York rap record that failed even to 
crack the national Top 40 would stand as the most noteworthy single of the 
decade? 
</P>
<P>
Hailed by pop critics but little-known initially outside the emerging East 
Coast rap scene, "The Message" by Grandmaster Flash &amp; the Furious Five was 
a hugely influential record in the development of rap, the most persuasive new 
pop sound of the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic chronicle of the tension and despair of ghetto life also outlined 
a series of social issues, from homelessness to gang crime, that would continue 
to be addressed by rap and other pop artists through the decade. 
</P>
<P>
The first challenge of pop is to be appealing musically, but the most 
compelling records also convey a strong point of view. That doesn't always mean 
social commentary, but at least a passionate and convincing tone that combines 
imagination, craft and heart. 
</P>
<P>
The best singles of the '80s: 
</P>
<P>
1. Grandmaster Flash &amp; the Furious Five's "The Message" (Sugar Hill, 1982) 
-- This blueprint was studied by such varied and acclaimed rap forces as 
Run-DMC, Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, N.W.A and De La Soul. Sample 
line: 
</P>
<P>
 'Cause it's all about money 
</P>
<P>
 Ain't a damned thing funny 
</P>
<P>
 You have to have a con 
</P>
<P>
 In this land of milk and honey. 
</P>
<P>
 2. U2's "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" (Island, 1987) -- Typical 
of the cautious idealism of the '80s, this majestic single by the Irish rock 
group carried a humble, almost wary edge that was shaped by the 
disillusionments of the '60s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
3. Prince's "Controversy" (Warner Bros., 1981) -- To underscore Prince's 
position as the premier hit-maker of the '80s, two of his singles are included 
on today's list. This one, a mocking slap at rigid pop and social attitudes, 
introduced his provocative sex 'n' salvation vision. 
</P>
<P>
4. Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" (Epic, 1983) -- Sparked by a captivating 
vocal and one of the most striking rhythm tracks ever in pop, this bizarre 
riddle about temptation and guilt was a masterpiece of pop dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
5. Prince's "When Doves Cry" (Warner Bros., 1984) -- Or, to underscore Prince's 
productivity, perhaps "Little Red Corvette," "1999," "Purple Rain," "Kiss," 
"Mountains" or "U Got the Look." 
</P>
<P>
6. Bruce Springsteen's "Brilliant Disguise" (Columbia, 1987) -- "Born in the 
U.S.A." was the more powerful anthem, but this bittersweet track from "Tunnel 
of Love" was perhaps the most darkly confessional song about commitment and 
doubt ever to make the national Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
7. Guns N' Roses' "Sweet Child o' Mine" (Geffen, 1988) -- An amazingly tender 
and affecting reflection on love and innocence from the so-called bad-boys of 
'80s hard rock. 
</P>
<P>
8. Run-DMC's "Walk This Way" (Profile, 1986) -- A spirited remake of the old 
Aerosmith hit that was a major break in the Cold War between rap and rock. 
</P>
<P>
9. R.E.M.'s "Radio Free Europe" (I.R.S., 1983) -- First released independently 
in 1981, "Radio Free Europe" helped ignite the alternative/college music scene 
that produced much of the decade's freshest music, much of it patterned after 
the wonderfully appealing, almost dreamlike instrumental textures of this 
single. 
</P>
<P>
10. Don Henley's "The End of the Innocence" (Geffen, 1989) -- Just as he 
co-wrote (with Glenn Frey) "The Long Run," the Eagles song that was a graceful 
farewell to the '70s, Henley co-wrote (with Bruce Hornsby) the song that serves 
as a benediction of sorts for the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Colleague Dennis Hunt picks Jackson's "Billie Jean" as the No. 1 single of the 
'80s, followed in order by Prince's "1999," Marvin Gaye's "Sexual Healing," 
Bobby Brown's "My Prerogative," Kim Carnes' "Bette Davis Eyes," Tone Loc's 
"Wild Thing," the Police's "Every Breath You Take," Manhattan Transfer's 
"Birdland," Billy Ocean's "Caribbean Queen" and Club Nouveau's "Lean on Me." 
His choice for single of 1989: Tone Loc's "Funky Cold Medina."

PUBLIC ENEMY LYRICS REKINDLE CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The acclaimed but controversial New York rap group Public Enemy is again 
drawing accusations of anti-Semitism with its new single, "Welcome to the 
Terrordome." 
</P>
<P>
The song, released this week by Def Jam Records under a distribution agreement 
with Columbia Records, addresses the controversy that swirled around alleged 
anti-Jewish statements made in interviews last spring by the group's "minister 
of information" Professor Griff (real name: Richard Griffin). Public Enemy's 
records had earlier expressed support for Louis Farrakhan, the controversial 
Nation of Islam minister who has called Judaism a "gutter religion." 
</P>
<P>
Griff was fired by Public Enemy, but then rehired in the role of community 
liaison and forbidden to give interviews. But group leader Chuck D (Carlton 
Ridenhour) continued to be criticized by many in the Jewish community, 
particularly Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the associate dean of Los Angeles' Simon 
Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies. 
</P>
<P>
Among the lines in the new song: "Told the rab, get off the rag," "So-called 
chosen, frozen" and "Apology made to whoever pleases / Still they got me like 
Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said this week that he believes the rab reference is to him -- a 
development which he finds particularly disturbing in the wake of a visit which 
he says Chuck D paid to the center's Holocaust museum two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Chuck spent an hour (at the museum) with me and a survivor of the Holocaust," 
Cooper said. "He went out of his way to say (then and in earlier conversations) 
he was not anti-Semitic, but this song crosses the line. So my message to him 
is, 'Will the real Chuck D please stand forward?' " 
</P>
<P>
Chuck D could not be reached for comment Friday, but was quoted in the New York 
Daily News as insisting that "Terrordome" is not anti-Semitic -- that the lines 
are about the media "crucifying" him. By the "chosen" he said that he meant 
Jews and Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper is not appeased. "The song is definitely anti-Semitic," he said. "The 
people who wrote it, who produced it and the record company that released it 
know it. We had the problem with Griff before. Now they've institutionalized 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Along with Cooper, the Anti-Defamation League is also holding the record 
company accountable and has sent a written protest to CBS Records president 
Tommy Mottola. In the letter, Jeffrey Sinesky, ADL Civil Rights Division 
director, said the lyrics revived the "repulsive and historically discredited 
charge" that the Jews killed Christ. Mottola was said to be on vacation and 
unavailable for response. 
</P>
<P>
Public Enemy's last album, "It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back," 
sold more than 500,000 copies and was named best album of 1988 in a Village 
Voice poll of more than 200 U.S. pop critics. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles rap radio station KDAY-AM began playing "Terrordome" even before it 
was released this week and the station's Michael Palmer, who often fields calls 
from people requesting various songs, suggests that most KDAY listeners respond 
to the beat rather than to the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
But Cooper believes the lyrics cannot be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tip-off that the impact of Farrakhan with this group and with young 
blacks in general is more profound than we want to recognize," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck D, however, says the lyrics are being over-interpreted. "I'm not saying 
the Jews killed Christ," he said in New York. "I'm commenting on the way the 
media came after me at the time. I'm telling the story from my perspective; my 
message is that we have to look after ourselves."

GRANT TO INVOLVE STUDENTS IN CHARITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The James Irvine Foundation has made a $200,000 grant to a Pepperdine 
University project that involves students with local charities. 
</P>
<P>
The project places 120 first-year MBA students in volunteer consulting 
relationships with nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The project "directly impacts the community in a very positive manner," said 
Wayne Strom, professor of behavioral science and management. "It serves to help 
the respective client agencies operate more efficiently . . . and it allows the 
students to get a 'hands-on' experience while still in school."

KWANZAA PARADE AND FESTIVAL CELEBRATES HERITAGE, PRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The annual Kwanzaa parade and festival begins at 10 a.m. today in the Crenshaw 
District. The events are a highlight of the holiday season in the black 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Kwanzaa is a seven-day cultural festival celebrated by blacks in the United 
States and the Caribbean. It includes family gatherings, community events and 
feasts celebrating African heritage and community pride. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60 units are expected in the Kwanzaa parade, says Shelia Ward, parade 
spokesperson. They will include African dance and drum groups, youth drill 
teams, equestrian units and high school and community bands. 
</P>
<P>
Stars Esther Rolle, Marla Gibbs and Roger Moseley will be in parade units, Ward 
says. Parade oba (king) is civil rights veteran Celes King III, and the iyaba 
(queen) is community activist Lillian Moody. 
</P>
<P>
The parade starts at Crenshaw and Exposition boulevards and heads south to 
Leimert Park at Crenshaw Boulevard and 43rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
The festival, in and around Leimert Park, begins at 10 a.m. Booths will offer 
international foods, books, African clothes and jewelry and T-shirts. Stage 
performances include jazz, reggae and Brazilian music and a children's 
recitation program, Ward says. The festival continues until dusk. 
</P>
<P>
All events are free.

'A WORLD OF HARMONY': ROSE PARADE COUNTDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The drama of the 1990 Tournament of Roses parade is reaching fever pitch as the 
big day approaches. Final touches will be put on the floats up to the last 
minute before the procession starts to wind its way through the Pasadena 
streets on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of the 1990 parade is "A World of Harmony," and the floats will 
directly reflect that theme with their emphasis on music. Thus this year, the 
parade will have an added dimension, according to Bill Walleck, director of 
special events for C. E. Bent &amp; Co., builders of 24 of the 60 floats that 
will be in the parade. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the floats will have live entertainment and music, such as jazz bands 
and choirs, combining sight with sound," he said. In the past, he said, the 
concentration on flowers and decor produced a mostly visual effect. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most innovative floats in this year's parade, according to Walleck, 
will be the GM-United Auto Workers entry. The float is a land vehicle that 
suddenly turns into a 57-foot-high robot emitting sounds and belching smoke. 
</P>
<P>
And, as usual, not all the flowers in the parade are roses, contrary to the 
parade's name. Orchids, flown in from Singapore, will be there in profusion, 
and chrysanthemums and other flowers have come from all over the world -- 
Mexico, South America, and even the Amsterdam flower market. 
</P>
<P>
The universality of the event is further underscored with the selection of Sen. 
John Glenn (D.-Ohio) as the grand marshal. Glenn, you may recall, was the first 
U.S. astronaut to orbit the Earth. For the many millions who can't be there in 
Pasadena Monday, television coverage will be ample, with pre-parade reporting 
starting at 7 a.m. on Channels 5 and 11. At 8 a.m. coverage will start on CBS 
(Channels 2 and 8); NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39); ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 
42); KMEX (Channel 34) and XETV-San Diego (Channel 6). And if you're too busy 
partying or watching football games, parade replays will be aired at 5 p.m. 
(Channel 11) and 7:30 p.m. (Channel 5).

JANUARY IS PREFERRED ROSE-PRUNING MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SIDNAM, Sidnam is an avid gardener and writer who lives in Orange 
County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Established roses require pruning every year, and January is the preferred 
month in Southern California for pruning rose bushes. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are a number of good books on the subject, nothing takes the 
place of an actual demonstration. And this January there are a number of rose 
pruning demonstrations throughout the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
To get a perspective on pruning roses -- and some ideas for those unable to 
attend a demonstration -- we visited Sherman Gardens in Corona Del Mar, one of 
the locations where the demonstrations will take place. 
</P>
<P>
According to Brad Carter, a horticulturist at Sherman, rose pruning 
accomplishes several objectives: It encourages strong new growth, promotes cane 
production, shapes the bush for maximum landscaping effect and opens the center 
of the bush to facilitate air circulation and sunlight penetration. Pruning 
also makes it easier to apply sprays and makes the sprays more effective. 
</P>
<P>
All of these lead to the main objective -- an attractive plant with beautiful 
blooms. 
</P>
<P>
Carter says the first step in pruning a rose bush is to visualize in your mind 
how you want the pruned bush to look when you are done. (He likes to achieve a 
vase shape on his own bushes.) 
</P>
<P>
Next, select your pruning tools: long-handled lopping shears and sharp pruning 
shears. Leather gloves are a must. 
</P>
<P>
The third step focuses on the canes of the plant. The canes of a rose bush are 
the main branches or stems that grow vertically from the crown of the plant. 
The smaller side branches grow off these canes. 
</P>
<P>
You should plan to remove all but four to seven canes from the plant. When 
planning, visualize a vase shape for the finished product. 
</P>
<P>
According to Carter, the canes you want to keep on the plant are the thickest, 
most robust canes. These are usually the younger canes and they will still have 
a slight green coloring on the bark. They should ideally be 1 inch in diameter, 
but smaller is alright. Again, keep in mind that your goal should be four to 
seven of the choicest canes. 
</P>
<P>
Begin the actual pruning process by removing all deadwood and all weak, twiggy 
branches. Then remove branches that cross the center of the plant and any that 
come in contact with the larger canes. Remove any suckers from the base of the 
plant by pulling them off with a rapid, downward yank. 
</P>
<P>
Next, after selecting the canes you are going to keep, cut the others off at 
the basal crown (at the bottom of the plant). Don't leave any stubs when you 
remove the canes. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with the canes that you are keeping, remove the lateral branches so that 
you essentially have long, thick canes with no branches on them. 
</P>
<P>
You then cut these bare canes to remove 1/3 to 1/2 of last season's growth. 
Carter says that you accomplish this by locating an outward-facing (away from 
the center of the plant) bud (eye or swelling on the cane from which new 
branches will emerge). Make a 45-degree cut about 1/4 inch above the bud. Be 
certain to always prune at a 45-degree angle so that the slanted surface keeps 
water from seeping into the cut. 
</P>
<P>
You now have the finished product, which is basically four to seven canes 
surrounding the crown and having a vase shape. 
</P>
<P>
Carter recommends one more step that he considers quite important. All cuts 
should be sealed. To do this, Carter applies a white glue (such as Elmer's) to 
the cuts. A commercial sealer may also be used instead of the glue. 
</P>
<P>
Carter cautions that the instructions here apply only to hybrid tea and 
grandiflora roses. Floribundas require a milder pruning, and climbing and 
old-fashioned roses are pruned differently. 
</P>
<P>
If you can spare the time, attend one of the rose pruning demonstrations 
scheduled over the next few weeks. These demonstrations not only provide visual 
instructions but also give you a chance to have your questions answered. 
</P>
<P>

ENCINITAS MAN CLAIMS $10.2-MILLION LOTTERY PRIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After waiting eight days, a 69-year-old Encinitas resident finally cashed a 
Lotto ticket worth $10.24 million Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Roy Thyret had purchased five Quick-Pick tickets at the Alpha Beta 
supermarket on El Camino Real in Encinitas. As a jackpot bonus, the store 
stands to earn $51,200, or 0.5% of Thyret's prize, lottery spokeswoman Joanne 
McNabb said. 
</P>
<P>
After deducting federal taxes, Thyret will receive $409,600 annually for 20 
years. His winning numbers were 44-14-23-27-21-12. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery officials had originally estimated Thyret's ticket as worth $9.9 
million but later realized that it was worth $10.24 million, McNabb said. 
</P>
<P>
Thyret's winnings were the second biggest of the month. On Dec. 13, a Santa Ana 
resident won $10.34 million. Both prizes, however, are a fraction of the 
state's biggest prize, a pot worth $62 million won Oct. 29, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Winners occasionally wait and get financial advice before turning in their 
tickets, or sometimes they simply don't notice that they've won, McNabb said. 
In any case, a winner has up to 180 days to cash a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Thyret, a 5-foot-11 man who enjoys plying the waters in his 51-foot boat, 
consulted with his bookkeeper and lawyer before claiming his prize. He said 
that he wanted "to keep publicity to a minimum." 
</P>
<P>
Fifty-three San Diego County residents have become millionaires through the 
lottery, with total winnings of $208 million, McNabb said. NORA ZAMICHOW

OWNERS TREAT CEMETERY AS A MONUMENT TO THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a windy hilltop overlooking a dusty canyon in Saugus, a tiny graveyard lies 
hidden by a grove of peppertrees and pines. "It's very peaceful here," said 
Andy Ponton as he walked past the aging headstones. 
</P>
<P>
Ponton knows the cemetery well. He owns it. 
</P>
<P>
When Ponton and his wife, Joyce, purchased nine acres in San Francisquito 
Canyon 11 years ago, included in the parcel was the small cemetery with graves 
dating back to the late 1800s. "This was a family cemetery for the Ruiz 
family," he said. Although the surnames on the stones vary, the people buried 
there were all related to the pioneer Ruiz clan in one way or another. 
</P>
<P>
Under deed restrictions placed on the property, the graves may not be removed 
and nothing can be built there. For the Pontons, the cemetery has become a 
cherished spot, a reminder of the canyon's frontier past and a quiet place to 
sit and think under the shade of an old peppertree, far from traffic and 
mini-malls and housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
"It means an awful lot to me," Joyce Ponton said. 
</P>
<P>
Although barren in the winter and dusted with brown pine needles, the cemetery 
will turn green in spring. "At Easter time, daffodils grow," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Pontons purchased the property and built a house, the land was 
unoccupied and the cemetery fell into disrepair. Vandals stole grave markers. 
Teen-agers partied there on Halloween. Riding clubs let their horses roam about 
the headstones. 
</P>
<P>
The Pontons fenced off the property and keep the small gate to the cemetery 
locked. They repaired some grave markers, including a cross that had toppled 
above the grave of Niebe Ruiz, a settler who, amazingly, lived in three 
different centuries. "She was born in 1794 and died in 1904," Andy Ponton said. 
</P>
<P>
The cemetery is a grim reminder of the day the St. Francis Dam collapsed on 
March 13, 1928, sending a wall of water down the canyon that killed more than 
450 people. A large marker, about 4 feet high and 11 feet across, is dedicated 
to the Ruiz clan. "It wiped out the family," Andy Ponton said. "There were some 
that were never found."

One grave belongs to a 10-year-old boy killed in the flood. "Nobody ever 
claimed his body," Andy Ponton said. The boy was brought to the Ruiz cemetery, 
where a plaque reads, "In Memory of those who lost their lives in the Santa 
Clarita Flood, March 13, 1928." 
</P>
<P>
The Pontons are not sure how many people are buried in the cemetery, which 
measures 100 feet by 100 feet. Many headstones have no names at all. Others are 
unreadable. 
</P>
<P>
Most graves date from the late 1800s and early 1900s, but a few people were 
buried there in the 1940s and even in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
The graves of babies fill one area Joyce Ponton calls "heartbreak corner." Many 
markers, such as the one for Arthur N. Rivera, feature tiny lambs carved in 
stone. He died in 1904 at the age of 2. 
</P>
<P>
"It was tough back in those days," Andy Ponton said.

FIGHT BREWS OVER ROAD EXTENSION IN CHEESEBORO CANYON; 
</P>
<P>
PARKLAND: HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL REQUIRES EXTENSION OF THOUSAND OAKS 
BOULEVARD TO THE BOUNDARY OF NATIONAL PARK SERVICE'S CANYON PROPERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A development project that would include a controversial road extension and 
threaten federal parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation 
Area has environmentalists gearing up for a battle. 
</P>
<P>
A Sunnyvale developer's proposal to build more than 16 times the number of 
housing units allowed in the county's general plan, on land just east of the 
national park, would require Thousand Oaks Boulevard to be extended to the 
boundary of the park's Cheeseboro Canyon property in Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
The county already has a right-of-way to build the four-lane boulevard through 
the heart of Cheeseboro Canyon, which the National Park Service bought in 1983 
for $8 million. Thousand Oaks Boulevard now ends in Agoura Hills, to the west 
of the national park, and begins again at Las Virgenes Road, at the eastern 
edge of the site of the proposed development, known as Malibu Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
Extension of the boulevard has been part of county highway plans since the 
1960s. But the proposal by Las Virgenes Properties to build 1,816 housing units 
and 60,000 square feet of commercial space just east of the park will make the 
boulevard a key issue when the Regional Planning Commission considers the 
project next year. 
</P>
<P>
The one-mile leg of Thousand Oaks Boulevard through Malibu Terrace, if it is 
approved by county officials, "would become a loaded gun pointed at Cheeseboro 
Canyon," said David M. Brown, a Calabasas conservationist. 
</P>
<P>
"Construction of Thousand Oaks Boulevard through the site will increase 
pressure to extend this major highway" through the park, according to an 
environmental impact report released this month. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental report stated that putting the road through the park would 
destroy about 250 oak trees, block a source of water into the canyon floor, 
threaten wildlife habitats and erect barriers to wildlife migration. 
</P>
<P>
National Park Service officials have asked the county to forgo its right to 
build the road through Cheeseboro Canyon. County Department of Public Works 
officials are considering different alignments for the road but have refused to 
drop the right of way, which the Park Service knew about when it bought the 
land in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental report states that the developer needs to build 116 houses 
and 1,700 apartments to offset the cost of building Thousand Oaks Boulevard 
through the rugged, landslide-prone 494-acre property. About 9 million cubic 
yards would have to be graded, much of it to stabilize the site to allow the 
boulevard to be extended through the project, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
If the project were held to the general plan's limit of 112 homes, the 
environmental report said, "it would not be economically viable for the project 
applicant to fund the improvement of Thousand Oaks Boulevard and stabilization 
of associated landslides." 
</P>
<P>
The report added, however, that a 112-home project might be feasible if Las 
Virgenes Properties were not asked to pay for the extension of Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Granucci, a spokeswoman for the county Department of Public Works, said 
Friday the department will recommend that Las Virgenes Properties be required 
to pay for its portion of the extension. 
</P>
<P>
County public works officials contend that the road is needed as an east-west 
alternate route to the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
But Fran Pavley, an environmental activist and member of the Agoura Hills City 
Council, questioned the prudence of financing a road by permitting a developer 
to build a project 16 times more dense than county plan limits. "The 
environmental costs are too great," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Agoura Hills City Council voted not to complete the 
city's portion of the four-lane boulevard. But whether that will be enough of a 
barrier to stop the county's plans to build it through the park is unclear, 
Pavley said. 
</P>
<P>
Putting the road into Cheeseboro Canyon, where a golden eagle was spotted 
Friday, "would bring the outside world into this little Eden in a very 
destructive way," Brown said.

MAIDEN FLIGHT OF B-24 BOMBER MARKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A commemorative envelope to mark the 50th anniversary of the flight of the 
first Liberator B-24 Bomber was issued Friday at the San Diego Aerospace 
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The twin-tailed, World War II bomber built in San Diego by Consolidated 
Aircraft Corp. took its maiden flight from Lindbergh Field on Dec. 29, 1939. 
</P>
<P>
More than 18,000 of the four-engine planes were built in the United States, and 
flown by the U.S. Navy, Air Force and Marines, said Bob McGuire, founder of the 
B-24 Liberator Club. The backbone of Allied air raids in Europe and the Pacific 
from 1942-1945, the Liberators were also flown by England, Australia and 
Canada, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 50th anniversary envelope, issued by the Liberator Club and canceled by the 
U.S. Post Office, bears an illustration of two of the bombers in formation with 
a Privateer, a single-tailed bomber flown by the U.S Navy in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The first 500 envelopes will also include a 3-cent 1942 Win the War stamp and a 
22-cent, contemporary flag stamp, McGuire said. 
</P>
<P>
The commemorative birthday envelopes will be sold for $2 from 10 a.m. to 4:30 
pm. in the rotunda of the museum at 2001 Pan American Plaza in Balboa Park. 
Proceeds benefit the museum.

ESCONDIDO SCHOOL DISTRICT ASKS SUPERINTENDENT TO STEP DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The superintendent of the Escondido Union High School District has been asked 
by the school board to quit by June 30 -- a year before his two-year-contract 
expires -- because of growing disenchantment with his management style. 
</P>
<P>
School board President Bruce Studebaker said the request for John Cooper to 
step down from the $77,000-a-year post was made "because we're trying to 
resolve turmoil in the district." 
</P>
<P>
"We have employees who are not very happy," Studebaker said. "I want good 
teamwork throughout the district, from top to bottom, from the board to the 
administration to the teachers, so we can provide education for our kids." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to ask Cooper to quit was made unanimously by the five-member 
school board in a closed session last month, said Trustee Jack Cherrington, 
board president at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems we were having in the district had to do with morale and the 
credibility of the administration," Cherrington said. "There was no single 
incident that created a problem. We recognize he has been with the district a 
long time. His efforts have been dedicated. He's hard-working, a taskmaster, 
articulate and very intelligent, and has done a lot of good for us. 
</P>
<P>
"But we found in talking around to people that there was a credibility issue 
with his management style. Once that trust had been violated, it was very, very 
difficult to re-establish it. He worked with great diligence to try to overcome 
it, but he wasn't succeeding, or at least not at a pace that was acceptable to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Studebaker said Cooper, 46, was being criticized by employees, including 
rank-and-file teachers, for turning a deaf ear to their input on personnel 
decisions, including such issues as teacher transfers and reassignments. 
</P>
<P>
"They believe decisions are being made in a vacuum, without their input," 
Studebaker said. "I'm not saying that's correct, but that's their perception, 
and it's affecting the confidence and trust we have in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're perceived as a problem, then whether you really are the problem or 
not isn't the issue," he said. "There's still a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, who has served as superintendent for 4 1/2 years, had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
Cherrington and another board member, John Damelio, met with Cooper earlier 
this month and extended to him several options that would allow him to stay in 
the district in another capacity, or to leave altogether, Cherrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper came back to the board with a couple of resignation scenarios, but they 
were considered too broad by trustees, who asked him to return again with more 
specifics. "We're sensitive to his professional needs," Cherrington said. 
</P>
<P>
As complaints about teacher morale mounted over the past year, discussion over 
Cooper's tenure had been a poorly kept secret, but the board was at loggerheads 
on how to deal with the problem until November. 
</P>
<P>
"There had been varying degrees of support for John, but in November we finally 
reached a compromise," Cherrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees had hoped to keep the matter behind closed doors until the board and 
Cooper could mutually announce a resolution, but Cherrington and Damelio 
confirmed the board's decision this week because "misinformation was being 
publicly provided by some of the major players," Cherrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Cherrington said the average tenure of a schools superintendent is about four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
He said the district will honor its commitment in paying Cooper the full amount 
of his contract, which runs through June, 1991, although the board and the 
superintendent are yet to sit down and negotiate details, including whether he 
will be paid off and allowed to leave the district, or will work in some other 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper joined the district in 1981 as a personnel director and was promoted in 
1983 to assistant superintendent for instructional services. He became 
superintendent in May, 1985, succeeding Forest Fouts, who retired.

PALMDALE DISTRICT TO OPEN 2 NEW SCHOOLS ON TUESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fast-growing Palmdale School District is set to open two new schools on 
Tuesday, easing the burden on the district's existing facilities and sending 
about 1,350 students to new classrooms on their first day back from the holiday 
break. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight will be the opening of the district's $5-million Desert Rose 
Elementary School, a permanent facility that will start with about 750 
students. The children had been using portable classrooms on the same campus 
since the scheduled fall opening of the new school had been delayed. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the district will open Mesquite Elementary School, a $2-million 
temporary collection of bungalows that will be used by about 600 students who 
spent the fall at Chaparral Elementary School, waiting for their own school to 
be completed. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. Forrest McElroy said the district now has room for about 13,000 students. 
"We're certainly in pretty good shape," he said. Originally, enrollment was 
expected to top 13,000 this year, but with a slowed housing market, district 
officials now expect it to remain under 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
The new schools will not require hiring of additional teachers and 
administrators, since both will come with the students from their prior 
quarters. Nor should the changes alter the size of classes, since those already 
had been restricted under the teachers' contract. 
</P>
<P>
But McElroy said the two new schools will ease the burden on libraries and 
cafeterias at the schools the students are leaving. 
</P>
<P>
The student population has almost tripled since 1984 from nearly 4,400 to an 
expected 11,700 this spring, so the Palmdale district has many schools sharing 
campuses and thousands of students in temporary quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The Desert Rose students had been sharing their temporary classrooms with 
another elementary school, Wildflower, on the same 10-acre site. With the 
opening of the new Desert Rose school there, Wildflower can expand, and both 
schools will now have separate cafeteria and library facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Students and teachers at Mesquite, which had been one of three schools crowded 
into temporary quarters on the Chaparral campus, will have their own bungalows 
on a separate five-acre site. Eventually, the district hopes to build a 
permanent school there.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 SHELTERS FOR THE HOMELESS TO STAY OPEN ON 
HOLIDAY WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two cold weather shelters for the homeless will be open throughout the holiday 
weekend in the San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles city officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Single adults and adult couples can find shelter in the Van Nuys National Guard 
Armory at 17330 Victory Blvd. Families with children will be housed at the 
Sylmar National Guard Armory at 12860 Arroyo St. 
</P>
<P>
The shelters, which opened Friday night, will remain open at least through 
Tuesday morning, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's emergency program for housing the homeless is activated when the 
temperature dips below 40 degrees or when the temperature drops below 50 and 
there is a 50% chance of rain. Temperatures in the San Fernando Valley were 
forecast to fall below 40 degrees Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The city will provide transportation to the shelters between 5:30 and 7 p.m. 
from four sites in the Valley: Van Nuys City Hall, 14410 Sylvan St.; Valley 
Community Clinic, 5648 Vineland Ave., North Hollywood; Valley Rescue Mission, 
11741 Glenoaks Blvd., San Fernando; and El Centro de Amistad, 7024 Deering

Photo, Drug Factory Smoked Out: Oceanside firefighters found a fully 
operational methamphetamine laboratory when they arrived at this house in the 
5000 block of Leon Street to put out a fire. Firefighters quickly contained the 
blaze, which began at 6:30 a.m. There were about 15 pounds of methamphetamine 
and paraphernalia used to make the illegal drug at the house, police 
spokeswoman Maryjane Midstokke said. No one was home at the time, but Narcotics 
Task Force officials said the house is rented to Joseph and Laurie Stice. The 
fire, caused when some rags ignited, did some smoke damage to the house and 
garage, but no structural damage, Midstokke said. No arrests had been made late 
Friday night. TOM KECK / For The Times

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN FALLS TO DEATH OFF LA JOLLA CLIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unidentified woman, age 65 or older and dressed in jogging clothes, 
apparently slipped and fell to her death down a La Jolla cliff Friday 
afternoon, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's body was discovered in a tide pool at 3:45 p.m. by three passers-by 
at the bottom of the cliff, in the 1500 block of Coast Walk. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that she fell from the cliff to the rocks below," San Diego Deputy 
Coroner Jerry Hillbrand said. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-1 woman, who carried no identification, was wearing a white Nike 
jogging sweater with blue trim and gray draw-string sweat pants, Hillbrand 
said. The 111-pound, blue-eyed woman wore white metal-rim glasses and carried 
two black Volvo keys, Hillbrand said. Beneath her jacket, she wore two 
long-sleeve sweaters: one tan, the other white. 
</P>
<P>
"The cliffs are very slick after the rain, and that could have been the reason 
she fell off," San Diego Lifeguard Lt. Brant Bass said. 
</P>
<P>
Four lifeguards and four San Diego police were involved with the rescue, Bass 
said. The victim was taken from the area, which is normally underwater, by 
helicopter, he said.

FUEL PRICE HIKES MAY BRING AIRLINE TICKET SURCHARGES; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: THE FEES WOULD BE THE FIRST IMPOSED SINCE THE OIL CRISIS OF THE 
EARLY 1970S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several airlines, including United and Continental, said Friday that they were 
considering placing surcharges on tickets to cover recent sharp rises in jet 
fuel costs. 
</P>
<P>
If imposed, the special fuel charges would be the first since the oil crisis of 
the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't clear whether the airlines would decide to impose the special charges 
-- and thus raise ticket prices -- after reducing fares earlier this week. Most 
of the nation's airlines have dropped excursion fares by as much as 30% to help 
fill planes during the slow winter months. 
</P>
<P>
It was speculated that calling a fuel-related fare hike a surcharge might make 
it more palatable to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Several airlines said Friday that they were concerned about the jump in fuel 
prices, which are up 40% from a year ago. Spot prices of jet fuel in New York 
have soared 70% this month, caused in part by Gulf Coast refinery fires and an 
Eastern cold snap that have strained oil supplies. 
</P>
<P>
"The price of fuel has been going crazy," said Art Kent, spokesman for 
Continental Airlines. "It is a serious problem. We are looking at a number of 
options; obviously a fuel surcharge is one of them." 
</P>
<P>
The increase in jet fuel prices has already prompted two airlines -- Trump 
Shuttle and Pan American World Airways -- to raise fares on their Northeastern 
shuttles by 20%, starting next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pan Am said it isn't considering a fare increase on its other more 
competitive routes. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of fuel has a direct impact on profits, because fuel accounts for 
about 15% of an airline's operating costs. A 1-cent rise in fuel prices costs 
the industry $150 million a year, according to the Air Transport Assn., an 
industry trade group. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Mattel, spokesman for Continental's sister airline, Eastern Airlines, 
said a possible fuel surcharge is under study. A fuel surcharge is also one 
option under consideration at United Airlines, said spokesman Joe Hopkins. 
</P>
<P>
Don Morrison, a spokesman for Trans World Airlines, said a fare increase is 
possible if fuel prices continue to rise but that the airline isn't considering 
a surcharge. 
</P>
<P>
Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and USAir said they were not studying a 
surcharge or a fare hike. 
</P>
<P>
Though the airlines regularly pass on cost increases to customers, the industry 
hasn't imposed a fuel surcharge since 1973, when oil prices rose steeply and 
the federal government allowed the airlines to raise fares a few dollars to 
help cover costs. 
</P>
<P>
The industry was deregulated in 1978, and airlines can impose fare hikes, or 
surcharges, without government permission.

Four California banks -- Union Bank, First Interstate, Bank of California and 
Wells Fargo -- are among the top banks nationwide with the largest exposure to 
potentially risky real estate construction and development loans, a survey 
released Friday shows. 
</P>
<P>
Several out-of-state units of California banks also have high exposures, 
according to the survey published by U.S. Banker magazine. Security Pacific 
Corp.'s Arizona operation had the highest level in the nation, although that 
unit is a small part of the Los Angeles banking company's overall operations. 
</P>
<P>
Although some banks here could be vulnerable to a real estate downturn, 
statistics from regulators show that real estate-related problems among 
California banks are nowhere near the troubles facing institutions in the 
Northeast. And officials of some of the California banks in question contended 
on Friday that their real estate loan portfolios are of top quality or are in 
strong markets. 
</P>
<P>
The survey comes amid increased nervousness among investors, banking experts 
and regulators as both residential and commercial real estate markets have 
softened in once-booming areas, mainly in the Northeast and Arizona. The 
spreading problem has led to concerns that real estate free-falls experienced 
in New England this year and earlier in Texas could hit California -- a 
position generally disputed by economists and banking experts. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Banking survey, conducted by Alex Sheshunoff &amp; Associates of 
Austin, Tex., measured exposure as the ratio of a bank's construction and land 
development loans to its equity capital. Figures were compiled using data from 
the second quarter ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
The survey found that at least 40 of the nation's 100 largest banks have lent 
more than 100% of their equity -- a measure similar to net worth -- to finance 
risky construction loans. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage for Union Bank in San Francisco, a unit of Bank of Tokyo, was 
239%. The level for San Francisco-based Bank of California, a unit of Japan's 
Mitsubishi Bank, was 207%. First Interstate's California unit, based in Los 
Angeles, had a 181% level. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo's was 179%, and 
Security Pacific's Arizona unit led all at 347%. 
</P>
<P>
But many lenders and economists believe that the situation for California 
lenders is markedly different than for lenders elsewhere, even though there has 
been sluggishness in office and hotel markets here, and the high cost of 
housing is squeezing potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
They note that the state's economy is still strong and diverse, demand for 
housing continues strong and widespread overbuilding has not occurred. Last 
week, economists with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco said they saw 
no signs of a real estate recession in California. Indeed, most real estate 
problems for California banks are at Arizona and Texas units. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Banker Editor Robert A. Bennett said the survey is not meant to imply that 
banks involved in extensive construction lending will have problems, nor is it 
meant to predict which ones will suffer losses. But, Bennett said, banks with 
the highest exposure could face big losses if the nation's real estate downturn 
continues to spread and worsen. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate loans include residential loans, such as home loans and home equity 
loans, and commercial real estate loans, typically those used to develop, build 
and purchase apartment buildings, housing tracts, shopping centers, office 
buildings and hotels. Commercial real estate loans are especially risky because 
of the volatile market. 
</P>
<P>
Banks in California have increasingly turned to real estate loans, which is a 
higher-profit, higher-risk business. In the quarter ended Sept. 30, the 
portfolio of California real estate loans made by banks totaled $98.9 billion, 
up 25% from a year earlier, according to figures from the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
FDIC statistics show that the percentage of bank real estate loans made in 
California that are either 90 days or more past due, or do not earn interest, 
has actually dropped within the past year. As of Sept. 30, the percentage was 
1.86% of $98.9 billion in real estate loans, 27th among states in the nation. 
That compares to 2% at June 30 and 2.26% at Sept. 30, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
California's percentage also was below the national averages of 2.84% on Sept. 
30. In addition, FDIC figures show that although real estate loans make up 
about 42% of the total loan portfolio of banks in California, that is not 
unusually high by national standards. 
</P>
<P>
Many bank officials were unavailable to respond to the U.S. Banker survey on 
Friday because of the holidays. Michael Cummings, senior vice president in Bank 
of California's real estate industry group, said the bulk of its real estate 
loans finance construction of single-family tract homes in Southern California, 
which it considers to be a good business. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Altick, a senior vice president with Wells Fargo, said the bank 
considers its real estate loan portfolio to be top quality, adding that it has 
been unfairly linked by investors to spreading real estate problems at other 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fair to say we are suffering from guilt by association," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Union Bank said in a statement last week that it believes that California will 
not suffer the kind of real estate downturn experienced in other areas.

BIG NAMES FLOP WITH CHRISTMAS BUYERS; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: THE TRUMP GAME AND PEE-WEE CLOTHES ARE AMONG THE RETAIL SALES BOMBS 
THIS HOLIDAY SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Donald J. Trump, for a change, came away a loser this Christmas. Joe DiMaggio 
struck out. And Pee-Wee Herman had little to giggle about. 
</P>
<P>
Merchandise that was, in one way or another, linked to their names apparently 
ranked among the bigger disappointments this holiday gift-giving season. 
</P>
<P>
Solid sales figures aren't available yet. But it's clear that even though many 
manufacturers and retailers narrowed their losses by taking fewer chances on 
imaginative new products, they still came up with some flops that gathered dust 
on store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Retail industry observers said some of the bombs were products that relied on 
simple gimmickry or, perhaps, on little more than the notoriety of the people 
associated with them. 
</P>
<P>
"Trump: The Game" suffered from its somewhat misleading image as a clone of the 
longtime favorite board game "Monopoly." But even more damaging, analysts said, 
was the public's apparent growing disenchantment with the real estate baron 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
"If there was a Leona Helmsley game, that would have been a dud, too," said Al 
Aguiar, a retailing consultant in Cameron Park, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Janelle Berger, assistant manager of the Toys International store in Glendale, 
said the Trump game eventually sold out at her store. But, she said, it didn't 
start moving until it was marked down from $40 to $29, and a sign was put up 
indicating that Trump's proceeds would go to charity. 
</P>
<P>
"Trump doesn't need any more money, and I think people realized that," Berger 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers weren't turned on by entertainer Pee-Wee Herman, either. A line of 
children's clothing he promoted for J. C. Penney stores reportedly fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
The fashion world saw women's jodhpurs, pants styled along the lines of 
horseback riding breeches, get off to a slow start. Alan Millstein, publisher 
of Fashion Network Report, said would-be buyers, particularly in the 35-to-54 
age bracket, weren't interested in a design that accentuated their hips. 
</P>
<P>
"Women didn't want to look like the back of a horse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many other goods that were labeled mild disappointments sold reasonably well 
but failed to meet store owners' overblown expectations. For example, "Game 
Boy," the much ballyhooed hand-held video game from Nintendo, sold out at many 
stores but never generated the hysteria that some retailers anticipated when 
word came out earlier this year that Christmas supplies would be limited. 
</P>
<P>
William B. White Jr., a Nintendo spokesman, described Game Boy as a big 
success, but he acknowledged that it wasn't in "the Cabbage Patch range," 
referring to the doll that was the rage among young children during previous 
holiday seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Although the regular Nintendo game and other video goods remained popular, 
retailers said shoppers otherwise turned away from high-tech and electric toys 
in favor of more traditional products such as dolls and action figures. Among 
the victims: several of the lines of "hyper cars," the speedy battery-powered 
vehicles that have been a big hit in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
But even if parents tended to buy toys that forced children to use their 
imaginations, they didn't snap up old-fashioned educational gifts. At Toys R 
Us, the nation's leading toy retailer, sales of microscopes and telescopes were 
soft for the second year in a row, said Vice Chairman Michael Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a sad commentary on our times," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, adult consumer electronics items fared well, but certain 
segments of the market suffered. Lee Isgur, an analyst with Paine Webber, said 
VCRs still are popular, but sales this Christmas tapered off faster than some 
retailers anticipated. The problem, he said, is that many people already own 
VCRs and don't need a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Among camcorders, VHS models seemed to lose out to the sleeker, though more 
expensive, 8-millimeter devices. Home computers were a bomb for yet another 
Christmas, but that apparently wasn't much of a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
The wallet-size "electronic notebooks" brought out this year by such companies 
as Casio and Sharp Electronics also failed to win over customers. They can be 
used as appointment calendars, personal telephone directories and memo pads, 
but they offer little advantage over pencil and paper, Isgur said. 
</P>
<P>
"You better have an improvement. Otherwise, it won't sell," Isgur said. "The 
public is very smart." 
</P>
<P>
At bookstores, the most expensive titles languished. "The pricing in art books 
has gotten away a bit from the market," conceded Edward A. Morrow Jr., 
president of the American Booksellers Assn. and owner of a book shop in 
Manchester Center, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
Morrow cited "Chagall: The Russian Years 1907-1922" and "Georgia O'Keeffe in 
the West," both priced at $100. Morrow's store ordered 12 copies of the 
O'Keeffe book and sold only two or three; he received five or six of the 
Chagall books and sold none. 
</P>
<P>
The store's biggest flop, though, was "Six Days in Havana" ($25) by James 
Michener and his longtime associate, John Kings. It recounts their visit to 
Cuba to research Michener's recent novel, "Caribbean." Morrow, who has sold 
only one or two of his 25 copies, speculated that Michener fans are mainly 
interested in his fiction. 
</P>
<P>
Another bomb at the bookstores: "The DiMaggio Albums," a two-volume pictorial 
set about the former New York Yankee slugger that was priced in October at $100 
but is now going for less than half that amount. 
</P>
<P>
For novelty items, the picture was mixed. Many customers broke from the pattern 
of practical buying to get the "Rock'n Flower," a plastic flower that "dances" 
to music. 
</P>
<P>
In other cases, though, the buying public showed its levelheadedness. That's 
what Target Stores said it found with the "Grin and Bare It" doll. 
</P>
<P>
The doll, which is supposed to be attached to a car's window, comes with a 
string that lets the owner pull down the doll's pants at drivers who pass by. 
</P>
<P>
"It's totally tasteless," said George Hite, Target's vice president of consumer 
affairs. "It's a credit to American consumers that they didn't buy it."

NORTHWEST PLANNED TO DISCLOSE BOMB THREAT AT THE GATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Northwest Airlines did not plan to notify passengers of a bomb threat against 
its Paris-to-Detroit flight until they arrived at the boarding gate today, 
airline officials said Friday. But after the threat was disclosed in a Swedish 
newspaper, the airline made it public Thursday, two days in advance of today's 
scheduled departure, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 30 passengers are said to have asked for a different flight, 
according to the Associated Press. However, many passengers are still unaware 
of the threat and will only find out today when they arrive at the gate, 
Northwest officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The predicament of Northwest Flight 51 illustrates dilemmas facing all airlines 
when terrorist threats are made. Most, including Northwest, say they will 
inform passengers in advance as a matter of policy. However, such publicity 
could hurt the ability of authorities to investigate the threats. 
</P>
<P>
But in most cases, notification well in advance is often impossible because 
threats usually come only moments before flights are scheduled to depart. Most 
threats turn out to be hoaxes. 
</P>
<P>
"If we get to the point where we felt there was a possibility of serious harm 
toward a passenger or a plane, we would then make a public announcement," said 
Donald Morrison, a spokesman for Trans World Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy heated up about a year ago when Pan American World Airways 
Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 259 passengers. The 
Federal Aviation Administration had learned about a threat to a Pan Am flight 
between West Germany and the United States based on a single phone call. But 
the phone call was later termed a hoax by the airline, and Pan Am did not 
inform passengers. 
</P>
<P>
What makes the Northwest case somewhat different is that the threat was made so 
much before flight time, giving authorities more time to investigate and beef 
up security. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest won't say when it got the threat. But when it did, the airline said, 
it immediately notified authorities. 
</P>
<P>
When a newspaper in Sweden ran a story that there had been a threat against the 
flight, it triggered an agreement between the Minneapolis-based carrier and 
U.S. and French government authorities. The agreement specified that if there 
were any leaks about the threat, the airline could also make it public. 
</P>
<P>
"We were working with the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, the State Department and French law enforcement agencies," said 
Bob Gibbons, a Northwest spokesman. "Their recommendation was to keep the 
threat as private as possible for as long as possible. In their view it was 
better to investigate in private than to have high public attention and we 
agreed." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 130 people who have reservations on the DC-10 for Detroit and San 
Francisco won't find out about the threat until they get to the airport anyway. 
Gibbons said it is very difficult to reach people and that some passengers may 
not be aware of news reports. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest won't detail any of what it labeled as "heightened security 
precautions" on all of its transatlantic flights. 
</P>
<P>
"If the good guys want to catch the bad guys, then the good guys cannot tell 
the bad guys everything they are doing," Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest says the publicity has not affected other overseas or domestic 
flights, because the threat was directed at a specific flight and because 
attention has been drawn to additional security precautions being taken. 
</P>
<P>
The final decision on whether the plane departs will be the pilot's, Gibbons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines willing to discuss security measures say they generally notify 
passengers if threats are taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
American Airlines said it takes every bomb threat seriously and evaluates each 
case. Delta Air Lines spokesman Jim Lundy said that "when we get a threat and 
we consider it as being serious we make every attempt to keep the passengers 
informed." 
</P>
<P>
But the airlines say there are so many threats that each one must be analyzed. 
FAA spokesman Robert Buckhorn said there are more than 300 bomb threats a year, 
and most of them turn out to be hoaxes. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get a threat we almost always unload the passengers, unload the bags, 
we advise passengers of the security situation and allow them to choose an 
alternative," Northwest's Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
A Pan Am spokeswoman, Pam Hanlon, said late Friday that the airline always had 
a policy of informing passengers of bomb threats when they are against specific 
airlines and when they are considered serious. This, she insisted, has been the 
airline's policy both before and after the Lockerbie tragedy on Dec. 21, 1988.

Keating Brother Dropped From Suit: Federal attorneys dismissed a brother of 
millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr. as a defendant in a $1.1-billion lawsuit 
stemming from the failure of a savings and loan owned by Keating's American 
Continental Corp. William J. Keating was one of several family members and 
American Continental executives named in a lawsuit filed in September by the 
Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency responsible for cleaning up the 
thrift industry. William Keating is president of the Detroit Newspaper Agency 
and chairman of the Associated Press. The lawsuit accused Charles Keating, 
several family members and other senior company officers of devising a scheme 
to loot Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn.

PERSONAL FINANCE / BILL SING: 1980S WERE TERRIFIC FOR SMALL-TIME INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No doubt about it -- the 1980s were a great decade for individual investors, 
perhaps the greatest ever. The average small investor tripled his money. The 
Dow Jones index of 30 industrials set records unthinkable at the start of the 
period. Tax rates and inflation fell. New products -- such as money-market 
mutual funds and interest-bearing checking accounts -- flourished. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, we had our setbacks, too. The 1987 crash, big deficits, a 
decade-ending real estate slump. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a listing of the decade's top 10 personal finance trends and events, 
ranked by their impact on individual investors: 
</P>
<P>
1. Taming of inflation. The lowering of inflation from 11% at the beginning of 
the decade to below 5% arguably was the single most important factor in making 
financial assets shine during the 1980s. Investors finally earned real returns 
on their money versus inflation, a sharp reversal from the 1970s, when returns 
after inflation were often negative. This factor, more than any other, made the 
1980s the best decade for investing in the postwar era. 
</P>
<P>
2. Deposit deregulation. Banks and savings and loan associations became free to 
offer market rates on all certificates of deposit and other savings accounts. 
Institutions nationwide also were allowed to offer interest-bearing checking 
accounts. These changes gave unprecedented choices to savers. 
</P>
<P>
3. Tax reform, 1981. Whether or not you agreed with it, Ronald Reagan's first 
major tax legislation, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, had impact. It 
dropped the top individual tax rate from 70% to 50% and opened other tax 
breaks. But it also resulted in an unprecedented federal budget deficit that is 
still responsible for interest rates remaining higher than they otherwise would 
be. 
</P>
<P>
4. Tax reform, 1986. This effort -- aimed at simplification although ending up 
being more the opposite -- reduced tax brackets from 14 to three, cut the top 
individual tax rate to 33% from 50% and made capital gains taxable as ordinary 
income. It also effectively killed most tax shelters. 
</P>
<P>
5. The bull market. The Dow started the decade at a measly 824. Since bottoming 
out in August, 1982, the Dow has climbed nearly 2,000 points, enriching 
millions of investors directly through stocks or mutual funds, or indirectly 
through pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
6. Growth of the adjustable-rate mortgage. The ARM -- which reached its heyday 
in the 1980s -- allowed many, particularly in California, to afford a home. But 
it also shifted the risks of changing interest rates to homeowners and away 
from lenders. 
</P>
<P>
7. Real estate boom and bust. Rousing home price rises made easy profits for 
many homeowners in California and other hot markets. But they also priced 
millions of others out of affording the American Dream -- a major cause for 
today's sluggish market. 
</P>
<P>
8. Mutual fund boom. Fund assets grew tenfold to nearly $980 billion -- 
equivalent to about $4,000 for every man, woman and child in the country. A 
main source: the explosion in money market funds, which introduced many 
investors to the fund concept and thus laid the groundwork for growth in stock 
and bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
9. The crash. The 508-point nose dive on Oct. 19, 1987, seemed like Armageddon 
at the time. Although the loss has since been made back, the crash legacy 
remains, and it continues to scare millions of individual investors away from 
stocks, making them much more cautious about their investment choices. 
</P>
<P>
10. Expansion of individual retirement accounts. Investors were allowed to make 
tax-deductible contributions to these popular retirement savings vehicles 
regardless of whether they had retirement plans at work. However, the Tax 
Reform Act of 1986 restricted this privilege.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: CONFUSION OVER MEDICARE SURTAX REPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Now that the Medicare catastrophic care surtax has been repealed, can 
you tell me what I am supposed to do about surtax payments that I was supposed 
to have made along with my estimated income tax payments throughout the year? I 
had deferred making my surtax payments during the year until the final 
estimated payment. But now, do I just ignore the whole thing, or do I make the 
payment with the final estimate and get a refund? Do I have to file any report? 
Neither the Social Security Administration nor the Internal Revenue Service are 
much help on this. -- L.G. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Fortunately for you, the correct answer is also the easiest: Do 
nothing. You delayed action long enough to see the quick demise of the 15% 
surtax on income taxes that the federal government had originally begun 
imposing this year on Medicare recipients for catastrophic care. However, the 
tax was repealed before the first tax year was completed, and, technically, no 
surtaxes are owed. 
</P>
<P>
Also, our tax experts say that those who did make estimated income tax payments 
that included a provision for the 15% surtax should reduce their final 
estimated payments to reflect the surtax payments throughout the year. 
Otherwise, you might be in line for a refund. 
</P>
<P>
Procedure Clarified For Moving 401(k) to IRA 
</P>
<P>
One additional note to last week's discussion of how to handle a 401(k) account 
when switching employers. If you recall, a reader wanted to know whether he 
should roll his 401(k) funds into an individual retirement account or into the 
pension plan offered by his new employer. 
</P>
<P>
We advised him that one of the special tax benefits available to pension plan 
withdrawals -- five- or 10-year income averaging -- would be available if he 
put his 401(k) funds into a separate IRA account, segregated from all other 
retirements savings. This is true, but only if he later rolls those IRA funds 
-- untouched -- into a qualified pension plan of some sort. This qualified plan 
could be offered by a future employer or it could be a Keogh plan he later 
establishes should he go into business for himself. 
</P>
<P>
The point is that, if our reader wants to take advantage of the special income 
averaging, the IRA must only be used as a temporary parking place for the 
funds. You cannot take advantage of the income averaging, which can save you 
thousands when you begin receiving distributions near retirement, when you 
withdraw straight from an IRA. This advantage is available only for withdrawals 
from a qualified pension plan. 
</P>
<P>
New Retiree Will Still Pay Social Security Tax 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am 65 years old and will be retiring as of Dec. 31 of this year. I expect 
to receive a significant payment in 1990 for work I performed in 1989. I 
realize that I will have to pay income taxes on this payment when I file my 
return for 1990. But what about Social Security taxes? Will I have to make a 
contribution to the Social Security fund based on these earnings in 1990 even 
though I am technically unemployed? I have already paid the maximum Social 
Security tax for 1989. -- M.L. 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, in addition to income taxes, you will be assessed Social Security taxes 
on the income you receive in 1990, even though that payment is for work 
performed in 1989. The way the system works, you are taxed based on when the 
payment is received, not when the work is performed. So even though you paid 
the maximum tax in 1989 and will be technically unemployed -- and may even be 
receiving Social Security benefits in 1990 -- you will owe Social Security 
taxes on the final employment payment you receive in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
However, in case it matters, you should know that whatever income you receive 
in 1990 based on your 1989 work will not in any way reduce the amount of Social 
Security benefits you are allowed to receive during 1990.

NEW 'WEAPON' BLASTS NORIEGA: BUSH'S SPEECHES 
</P>

If the Bobby Fuller Four singing "I Fought the Law and the Law Won" over and 
over and over won't drive Manuel A. Noriega out of the sanctuary of the 
Vatican's embassy here, American military psychological experts may think they 
can bore him into giving up. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hitting him with President Bush's speeches now," said an Army sergeant 
from Chicago who was standing guard at a road barricade a block from the 
Vatican mission, where Noriega has been a refugee since Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about Noriega, but listening to his (Bush's) speeches all day 
long is driving me (batty)," said the bedraggled and grimy soldier, who is a 
military policeman with the 82nd Airborne Division. 
</P>
<P>
Another soldier was heard to mutter: "This is like being trapped in an elevator 
with a busted Muzak machine. I ain't getting much sleep." 
</P>
<P>
The introduction of Bush oratory over the blaring loudspeaker system is the 
newest ingredient in the mind games that American forces are using to harass 
both Noriega and the diplomats who are providing him refuge from his American 
pursuers. 
</P>
<P>
Starting three days ago, U.S. troops have been playing rap songs, heavy metal 
and traditional rock 'n' roll, mostly with titles and lyrics with 
less-than-subtle messages. Sometimes it is Linda Ronstadt belting out "You're 
No Good," and sometimes Michael Jackson's "Beat It" fills the air. 
</P>
<P>
After U.S. officials asserted that Noriega had a fixation on witchcraft, the 
makeshift radio network introduced the late rocker Jimi Hendrix singing "Voodoo 
Child." 
</P>
<P>
At the distance reporters are kept away from the embassy, it is difficult to 
make out which Bush speeches are being played; all that is certain is that the 
high volume and poor sound quality gives the president's nasal voice a 
screeching tone. 
</P>
<P>
The sergeant said that he hadn't been told anything about the Bush sound track, 
but it evidently includes statements criticizing the ousted Panamanian 
dictator. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, the music and the speeches, which also are aimed at preventing 
broadcast journalists from listening in on military radio conversations, 
probably bother American soldiers guarding the area more than anyone inside the 
embassy. 
</P>
<P>
The structure, an old, solidly constructed mansion, has thick walls and 
shuttered windows that likely filter out most outside sounds. 
</P>
<P>
The odd, even surreal quality of the broadcasts fits in nicely with the 
character of the general scene around the embassy, which is located in an 
upscale neighborhood of high-rise apartments and a hotel once used as the 
Panamanian army's press center. 
</P>
<P>
The approaching streets are blockaded by Sheridan tanks with their 
105-millimeter cannons pointing at the small crowds of Panamanians and 
reporters who gather daily nearby. Barbed wire stretches across the streets, 
and troops in full battle gear turn back traffic and keep the people at bay. 
</P>
<P>
But the menacing weapons and the barricades haven't soured the mood of the 
people who spend the day looking on and applauding every American helicopter 
gunship that passes overhead. They cheer every U.S. military convoy that drives 
in and out of the makeshift siege line. 
</P>
<P>
The already popular American soldiers endear themselves even more by handing 
out Army meal kits called MREs, officially named Meals Ready to Eat but less 
officially called Meals Rejected by Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
The crowds range from about 25 people to a high of a couple of hundred. They 
stand alternately in the sun or the daily rain that falls in the afternoon, 
munching on MREs or ice cream bars sold from a pushcart. Somehow, they ignore 
the smell that wafts in from fetid mud flats that line nearby Panama Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Some people carry signs urging all sorts of horrible fates for their one-time 
leader, while others approach journalists to say how happy they are to be 
occupied by the American military. 
</P>
<P>
"Noriega is no political refugee, he is a criminal," reads a torn bedsheet 
draped across a sidewalk railing. "Noriega must be hanged, not exiled," says 
another. 
</P>
<P>
A favorite insignia on the signs is a diagonal black line drawn across a 
pineapple, a reference to Noriega's complexion, which is so deeply pockmarked 
that it resembles the rough-skinned fruit. 
</P>
<P>
When a television camera is pointed at the crowd, invariably someone throws a 
pineapple to the ground and stomps on it. 
</P>
<P>
While the mood is jovial, it often evolves into a kind of unthinking giddiness. 
</P>
<P>
"See that! Look at that!" complained a heavyset woman, her brightly dyed red 
hair shaking with anger as she pointed to a light scratch on the skin above her 
right knee. "Noriega did that. You should hang him." Then she giggled. 
</P>
<P>
Alicia Menija, a self-proclaimed 29-year-old "beauty consultant," approached a 
reporter and asked if he was an American. When told yes, she enfolded him in 
her arms and said, "I love Americans. Can you buy me lunch?" 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, most of whom keep a good humor through all of this, are 
constantly bombarded with requests to pose with onlookers for pictures. When 
they say yes to one person, groups suddenly crowd through the gaps in the 
barbed wire and close in on the troops and clamber onto the tanks and other 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
According to Sgt. Cowan Dale, a 26-year-old military policeman from Socorro, 
N.M., no one has tried seriously to break through the lines -- "only a drunk or 
some confused person. We just turn them around."

ORTEGA TO EXPEL AMERICANS OVER ENVOY INCIDENT

U.S. troops surrounded the residence of Nicaragua's ambassador Friday, ordered 
all personnel inside to evacuate and searched the premises for weapons, the 
ambassador said. 
</P>
<P>
In Managua, President Daniel Ortega said Friday night that 20 American 
diplomats and about 100 U.S. Embassy administrative and service employees will 
be expelled in retaliation for the incident, which he called "unheard of." 
</P>
<P>
In an announcement broadcast nationwide, Ortega said the 120 Americans, whose 
names would be made public within a few hours, will be given 72 hours to leave 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
"This violates the principal foundations of the extraterritoriality of 
diplomatic missions," Ambassador Antenor Ferrey told a news conference. "The 
North Americans are going to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrey said he and several other people waited outside while American troops 
searched the building for about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
The troops seized five rifles inside the residence that Ferrey said were there 
for self-defense. A U.S. Army colonel in charge of the operation later 
apologized and returned the rifles, Ferrey said. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Ferrey said Ortega told him by telephone that the Sandinista 
government plans to protest the incident at the United Nations and the 
Organization of American States. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy and military officials in Panama said they had no information on 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrey said he returned from Nicaragua's embassy at 6:10 p.m. to discover about 
60 U.S. troops had cordoned off several blocks surrounding the residence. 
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan ambassador said the unidentified U.S. Army colonel told him to 
go inside the residence, then the troops used a megaphone to order everyone 
inside to evacuate within five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
He said the colonel told him that he had been given orders to search the 
residence for weapons. A U.S. C-130 transport plane and a helicopter flew 
overhead. 
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguans eventually went outside and about 30 of the American soldiers 
went inside, Ferrey said, adding that he was prevented from accompanying the 
troops. "They searched the whole house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrey described the five rifles as "only light arms used to defend ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
He said the colonel ordered the arms placed in a U.S. military truck but later 
gave them back and apologized, saying there had been a mistake. The troops left 
the area of the residence shortly before 9:30 p.m. Ferrey said the U.S. troops 
had fired shots into the air before he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
In Managua, a state-run Voice of Nicaragua report quoted embassy employees as 
saying the troops "fired in the air and intimidated the people inside and 
forced them to come out with their arms in the air." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops have surrounded the Nicaraguan Embassy since the Dec. 20 invasion 
but not the residence, a cluster of three homes in an upper-middle-class 
neighborhood. People living near the residence said they heard gunfire and 
shouts ordering people to come out of the residence. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Cuba protested that its ambassador and another diplomat had been 
detained an hour by troops surrounding the Cuban Embassy. U.S. officials denied 
the ambassador had been detained and said the other official had forgotten his 
diplomatic credentials, which eventually were retrieved. 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. Embassy official said Thursday that under the terms of the Vienna 
Convention governing diplomatic procedures, U.S. troops have the right to 
search those entering and leaving missions for weapons.

U.S. TEACHER WAS SEIZED, EXECUTED BY PANAMA ARMY

Raymond Dragseth, an American college science teacher, was kidnaped and 
executed by Panamanian army units in the early hours of the U.S. invasion of 
Panama, according to American officials and family members. 
</P>
<P>
The body of the 47-year-old faculty member of Panama Canal College was exhumed 
Friday from a common grave in a public cemetery. He had been shot in the back 
of the head. 
</P>
<P>
Dragseth, who had lived here for several years, was the 28th American reported 
to die in the invasion, which began about 1 a.m. Dec. 20, and the third known 
U.S. civilian fatality. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview given to Cable Network News, Carolyn Dragseth, the dead man's 
daughter, said that uniformed Panama Defense Forces soldiers broke into their 
apartment in the well-to-do Punta Paitilla area of Panama City, the 
neighborhood that is also the site of the Vatican embassy, where ousted 
dictator Manuel A. Noriega is being given sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they were looking for my father," she said. "They broke into my 
parents' bedroom and took him . . . they just took him." U.S. sources said the 
Panamanians evidently had a list of Americans living in the area and were 
searching them out as potential hostages. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the American Embassy here treated Dragseth's disappearance as a 
hostage case until Thursday, when the family, including Panamanian presidential 
spokesman Anel Beliz, a relative by marriage, said they had photographs of the 
missing man's body that were taken in a hospital where he was left by unknown 
people after the killing. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, sources said, it was decided that Dragseth, who was the only 
American in the country still unaccounted for, probably was the dead man shown 
in the photographs. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, since the body had not been earlier identified, hospital 
officials ordered it to be buried in a common grave in the Jardin de Paz 
Cemetery near the ruins of the original site of Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
Daughter Carolyn and Dragseth's wife, Vicki, complained that they were ignored 
by the American Embassy here and the State Department in Washington throughout 
their ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
"The assistance given to us was absolutely minimum," Carolyn told CNN. "We 
tried everyone, and we tried everywhere. . . . For five days no one returned 
our telephone calls." 
</P>
<P>
She complained that even as of Friday, the family had not heard from the State 
Department. She said she understood that Washington officials were planning to 
issue a statement but had not even discussed that with her or other relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy declined comment, but there were indications of a bureaucratic 
breakdown in dealing with the case. It was thought that the first call from 
Vicki Dragseth the night her husband was abducted had gotten lost in the 
confusion and crush of the inquiries that flooded the embassy the night of the 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
And since there were several instances of Americans being taken hostage, no 
search was made in morgues or hospitals for his body. It wasn't until Thursday, 
when an American embassy employee who knew Dragseth personally overheard 
someone talking to Vicki Dragseth, that the case was put into a possible-death 
category. 
</P>
<P>
Why no one else made the connection or provided more substantial assistance to 
the family is unexplained. 
</P>
<P>
Dragseth is reported to be the uncle of Richard Paul, a Defense Department 
dependent who was killed Dec. 20 when he failed to stop at a U.S. Army 
roadblock. An American who was working in Panama as a schoolteacher, Gertrude 
Kandi Helin, 43, was slain by gunmen on the street not long after the U.S. 
invasion began. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent bureaucratic muddle in the U.S. handling of the Dragseth case is 
not unique in the aftermath of the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
In another case of apparent confusion or worse, the embassy and the U.S. 
Southern Command were unable to explain contradictions concerning the case of a 
former Israeli intelligence agent who served as Noriega's security adviser and 
is accused of several serious crimes here. 
</P>
<P>
According to a high embassy source, Mike Harari, who until 1979 was the chief 
of Israeli intelligence operations in Mexico and Central America, was arrested 
this week by American troops. "We have him, he is a prisoner of war," the U.S. 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
However, when asked about the case, officials of the U.S. Southern Command said 
that Harari had not been arrested and was not in their custody. When reporters 
pointed out the inconsistencies, neither agency would back down. 
</P>
<P>
The confusion deepened Friday when a close aide to Panamanian President 
Guillermo Endara said that "there is no doubt, absolutely none. The Americans 
have him." 
</P>
<P>
Harari, 62, would be an important catch. He is suspected of having full 
knowledge of Noriega's illegal business dealings and has been accused of taking 
part in hugely profitable extortion schemes involving kickbacks from businesses 
operating in Panama. He is commonly known here as "Mr. 60%" for the amount of 
money he demanded, official sources said.

CEAUSESCU BUNKER: HUB OF DREADED SECURITATE;

<P>
ROMANIA: THE STRONGHOLD WAS WHERE THE DICTATOR'S CRACK FORCE WAS PREPARED TO 
MAKE ITS LAST STAND.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three levels below the basement of the Romanian Communist Party's Central 
Committee building, there is a bunker built strong enough to withstand a 
nuclear attack. One room of its command center contains a wall of Japanese- and 
American-made equipment. It has now been shot to pieces, its wiring and 
circuitry ripped loose. 
</P>
<P>
This was where Nicolae Ceausescu's Praetorian Guard, the fanatical presidential 
protection unit of the Securitate, was prepared to make its last stand in 
defense of its leader. 
</P>
<P>
It did not work out that way. 
</P>
<P>
The three levels of the bunker are now occupied by soldiers of the Romanian 
army and volunteers of the Civilian Guard. At midday Friday, on the uppermost 
level of the bunker, weary soldiers slept on rows of folding chairs or on the 
floors of interconnecting rooms. Some ate quietly from cans of food, their 
assault rifles close at hand, as they rested from their shifts of tense guard 
duty in the narrow-carpeted passageways, which are interrupted by hatchway 
doors 2 1/2 inches thick. 
</P>
<P>
The doors are painted battleship gray, labeled with coded letters and numbers, 
and each weighs 1,000 to 2,000 pounds. Each is closed by four massive hatch 
latches. The soldiers now on duty in this underground maze know that on the 
other side of these doors, a network of tunnels leads out into the city. There 
is only one other thing that soldiers know about those doors: that somewhere 
beyond them are dozens, perhaps hundreds, of trained and fanatical killers, 
Ceausescu's last gift to the Romanian people. 
</P>
<P>
The mood in the bunker is taut. The soldiers and their officers move cautiously 
and quietly and speak in low tones. They take no visitors to the lowest depths 
of the bunker. It is difficult to tell whether the tension arises from a sense 
of imminent danger, the strangeness of the setting or the experience of 
spending the last week in combat against a force of fighters whose lethal 
fanaticism seems a creation out of science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
The fear is shared by the provisional government that has taken over from 
Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
Silviu Brucan, the respected 73-year-old diplomat who is a member of the 11-man 
council at the top of the new National Salvation Front, warned Friday that the 
several hundred members of the Securitate who remain at large are planning a 
program of assassination against the new government. 
</P>
<P>
"They realize they have been beaten," Brucan said, "and we expect them to focus 
on the center, to decapitate the movement, to kill the leaders of our movement. 
Therefore, I have been traveling in Bucharest only in a tank for the last three 
days. I can tell you one thing -- every time I moved, the tank was shot at. 
They know I am inside." 
</P>
<P>
Although the shooting in central Bucharest seems to have stopped, the sniping 
has not. On Thursday night, a woman was brought to the city's main emergency 
hospital, wounded by a sniper. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers who wait now in the Securitate's underground bunker are amazed and 
mystified by their opponents. A young army major and a 22-year-old Civilian 
Guard member (for the safety of their families, they asked that no other 
identification be used) told of the Securitate bunker and of the men they had 
been fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The Securitate fighters, they believe, were part of Ceausescu's crack 
presidential guard. In the first three days of the battle, when fighting went 
on across the palace square in front of the Communist Party Central Committee 
building, the Securitate fighters were wearing black jumpsuits with a red silk 
stripe down the right side. They wore black berets. They used submachine guns 
and high-powered rifles with infra-red sniper scopes. 
</P>
<P>
"They used Romanian-made, Soviet-model rifles," the major said. "They used 
small machine guns and other German, English or Italian weapons, all of the 
highest quality. They were very good shots. They shot only at the head." 
</P>
<P>
The tunnels these Securitate fighters used, the major said, have been explored 
only a short distance from the bunker. 
</P>
<P>
"We've blocked them off," he said, "to prevent them coming in. They can lock 
themselves in the tunnels." 
</P>
<P>
The two officers said they assume the tunnels are booby-trapped. 
</P>
<P>
"Also in the bunker is a bomb shelter," the major continued, "that we think 
could stand in a nuclear attack. It has a sophisticated air purification system 
and stores of food and water. There is a control room with instruments, 
communications equipment, covering one entire wall. There are telephones and 
televisions. At the moment they left, most of this equipment was destroyed. it 
was shot up, or ripped out. 
</P>
<P>
"We also found a special room for the decontamination of men and equipment. 
There is an office near this and a room for sleeping, with beds and toilets. 
This is at the center of the bunker, with easy access from several directions." 
</P>
<P>
Through the heaviest of the combat, last Friday, Saturday and Sunday, the 
officers said that the Securitate fighters sent men into the city in disguises, 
sometimes in army uniforms, to report on the positions of the army in the 
streets. They rigged up a loudspeaker and tape-playing device that broadcast 
sounds of heavy gunfire. When the soldiers in the streets moved and shifted 
their defenses to deal with what they thought was another battle, the 
Securitate fighters opened up on them. 
</P>
<P>
It is strange to most Romanians that the Securitate kept fighting long after 
Ceausescu fled the capital Dec. 22, and stranger still that some have continued 
to hold out even after his body, riddled by the bullets of a firing squad, was 
shown on national television. For most of the soldiers, as for the general 
population, it is the description of captured Securitate fighters that paints 
the eeriest picture of all. 
</P>
<P>
Not many, the major said, had been captured alive. Most apparently preferred to 
use their last bullets on themselves. Of the few that have been captured, he 
said, "some looked as though they had been drugged. They had no fear at all. 
Even if they were captured without arms, they attacked, they used anything they 
could pick up to fight with, even if they knew they could be shot immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"These captured terrorists have refused completely any food or water and 
refused to talk completely. They say nothing." 
</P>
<P>
All of them, they say, are large and muscular, like athletes or weightlifters, 
and in the few cases of hand-to-hand fighting, have demonstrated their skill in 
karate or some other martial-arts system. Just who they are, or how they have 
been trained, are subjects of intense speculation to the officers and soldiers 
who remark on how "strange" the Securitate men appear. 
</P>
<P>
"There are several opinions," the major said. "They do not look like 
intelligent men. They look like machines." 
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that many think the Securitate fighters are, in fact, orphans, 
raised from childhood to devote their lives to the defense of Ceausescu. This 
may be little more than fantasy -- there is not a single fact to support it -- 
but it is hard to find a Romanian who does not hold this belief. It is as 
prevalent among the soldiers who fought them as among the general population. 
</P>
<P>
Personnel at the city's main emergency hospital have stories that support the 
descriptions offered by the soldiers and are, in their way, equally bizarre. 
Dr. Andrei Firica, the director of the hospital, and another senior staff 
physician say that 12 men admitted with wounds ranging from critical to minor 
during the violence were suspected of being Securitate men. 
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that most of them were drugged," said the staff physician. 
"They were overexcited, and it required large doses of sedatives to calm them, 
to make them sleep. Almost all had been drinking as well. All were 
well-developed physically, strong and muscular. Some told us they were athletes 
or practiced high-performance sports." 
</P>
<P>
All but one denied being in the Securitate. One, however, identified himself as 
a major in the unit and said he was sorry only that he had failed in his duty 
and that he should have killed more people, Firica said. Among the group, two 
were of Asian or Asian-Romanian parentage. Four of them, the doctor said, 
appeared to be Arab. They spoke fluent, unaccented Romanian. Some carried as 
many as four differents sets of identification papers, all conflicting. 
</P>
<P>
"In general," the doctor said, "their comportment was very strange. The pupils 
of their eyes were dilated. They had a fixed look, their eyes staring. Whatever 
story they came in with, they stuck to . . . . Some of them had no reaction 
whatever to normal dosages of sedation. To make them sleep, they were given 
heavy sedatives." 
</P>
<P>
After that, they were handcuffed to their beds. The last of them was taken by 
the authorities from the hospital Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"There were two mysterious deaths -- two men, both with minimal wounds. One had 
a broken ankle, one had a bullet wound in the shoulder. We don't believe it was 
poison. We opened their mouths when examining them to check for that, for 
cyanide capsules. It wasn't that. We don't know why they died. It is a 
mystery." 
</P>
<P>
Since the revolution began, the hospital has treated 679 wounded, admitted 340, 
and received 116 dead. It was too overcrowded with emergency cases to perform 
autopsies on the dead Securitate men, so the mystery remains. 
</P>
<P>
The mystery of wht remains in the tunnels behind the steel doors leading out of 
the bunker under the Central Committee also lingers, and neither the soldiers 
nervously guarding them, nor a fragile government still moving about the city 
in tanks and armored cars, is sure what to do about them -- or how to clean 
them out.

ISRAELI BANK PLACES $1-BILLION COST ON PALESTINIAN UPRISING

One of Israel's leading banks has estimated that coping with the two-year-old 
Palestinian uprising has cost the country about $1 billion in expenses and lost 
revenues, bank officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
In a survey published by Bank Hapoalim, economists said that boycotts against 
Israeli products by Palestinians in the occupied territories together with a 
slowdown in tourism and costs incurred by the army have cost the nation about 
1% of its output of goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
One bank official said the percentage of the gross national product given to 
the uprising was significant, but "not a dramatic influence." 
</P>
<P>
The figure for the second year of the uprising was slightly less than for the 
first, which cost $600 million. The survey said the impact in the second year 
was not as great because the economy has begun to adjust to the situation.

ISRAELI POLICE BREAK UP PEACE MARCH IN JERUSALEM

Police fired tear gas, pulled demonstrators by their hair and struck them with 
night sticks to break up a peace march in Jerusalem on Friday by more than 
3,000 Israeli, Palestinian, European and American women. 
</P>
<P>
The hourlong procession from Jewish West Jerusalem to Arab East Jerusalem was 
without incident until the end, when an outlawed Palestinian flag was raised, 
and police dispersed the marchers. 
</P>
<P>
Police said 16 people were detained. Reporters saw police drag several women 
away by their hair or clothes. Some were struck with night sticks and several 
were kicked. All foreigners were later released. 
</P>
<P>
The women's march was part of a program organized by peace activists that is to 
culminate today with about 1,200 visiting Europeans and Americans expected to 
link hands with Israelis and Palestinians in a human chain around Jerusalem's 
Old City. 
</P>
<P>
The "1990 -- Time for Peace" demonstration today is intended to symbolize the 
unity of peace activists who endorse a negotiated Middle East peace settlement. 
Most of the marchers were Europeans and Jewish Israelis, with a smaller number 
being Americans and Israeli Arab women. 
</P>
<P>
Penny Rosenwasser of Oakland, who joined the march, said she came to find out 
for herself about the situation. "I came because our government is so heavily 
involved in the occupation and, as a Jew, I felt I had to do something," 
Rosenwasser said. She added that she also was ashamed of the Israeli treatment 
of Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
The army also said Friday soldiers accidentally shot two 12-year-old 
Palestinian boys during an assault on masked Arabs a day earlier in the 
occupied Gaza Strip. Both were reported in good condition at a Gaza hospital.

40 HURT IN CLASH OF HONG KONG POLICE, VIETNAM 'BOAT PEOPLE'; 
</P>

REFUGEES: STONE-THROWING CAMP RESIDENTS FEARED THEY WOULD BE FORCED TO RETURN

Police raided a Vietnamese refugee camp Friday and clashed with stone-throwing 
"boat people" who reportedly feared they would be forced to return to their 
Communist homeland. Hong Kong officials said 40 people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Police fired tear gas after the Vietnamese set fire to blankets and threw rocks 
to prevent a search for homemade weapons, said government spokesman Timothy Li. 
Twenty-seven Vietnamese were arrested and more than 700 weapons seized, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, a group of 111 "boat people" voluntarily left Hong Kong on a 
chartered airliner for Hanoi rather than face months or years in the crowded 
camps without hope of resettlement abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The 111 people made up the eighth group to return to Hanoi under a 
U.N.-sponsored voluntary repatriation program, bringing to more than 865 the 
number of Vietnamese who have willingly gone home. 
</P>
<P>
Their calm departure was in sharp contrast to the scene two weeks ago when Hong 
Kong police put 51 weeping "boat people" aboard a plane and sent them to Hanoi 
against their will. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is now seeing a steady trickle of voluntary departures from its 
camps, but government officials say this is not enough and forced repatriation 
will resume next month. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees is urging the British colony to put off 
plans to send more people back against their will and give the voluntary 
program a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Television footage of Friday's camp raid showed police equipped with helmets 
and shields firing tear gas. Smoke from the fires could be seen rising above 
the center on outlying Lantau Island, which houses more than 3,000 Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'boat people,' in order to make the operation more difficult, pushed their 
women and children to the front," said Security Secretary M. Geoffrey Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
The government-funded radio reported that the resistance may have been prompted 
by reports that some of those in the center may be in the next group of "boat 
people" forced to return to their impoverished homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Officials refused to say how many police joined in the operation, but the radio 
put the number at about 300. Police said Friday night that said 14 Vietnamese 
and 26 guards and policemen were injured in the camp. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said five hours of counseling by the staff of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees and voluntary agencies failed to persuade the 
Vietnamese to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
Police reported two clashes Thursday night between Vietnamese armed with 
homemade weapons at the Shek Kong Detention Center in which one person died and 
10 others were injured. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were investigating the cause of the brawls between two rival 
groups from Quang Ning. About 100 people were involved in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, five people have died this year in factional fighting that 
erupts frequently in the crowded and squalid Vietnamese camps. 
</P>
<P>
"This latest violence is a further manifestation of the unrest in the camps 
caused by the threat of forced deportation," said George Foulkes, of Britain's 
opposition Labor Party. "I fear that it is a foretaste of worse to come unless 
the government abandons its policy." 
</P>
<P>
Foulkes also accused Britain of delaying deportations at the request of the 
U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
"While they are dithering and delaying, the situation in the camps is reaching 
boiling point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman, who requested anonymity, said in response: "The 
facts are that considerable assistance is being given through our reintegration 
package to the 'boat people.' . . . We are not waiting for Washington." 
</P>
<P>
About 44,000 "boat people" who have sailed into Hong Kong since mid-June, 1988, 
are considered illegal immigrants unless they can prove they fled persecution. 
</P>
<P>
Those who are denied refugee status and have their appeals rejected can 
volunteer to go home or face forced repatriation. 
</P>
<P>
The 12,000 "boat people" in Hong Kong who arrived before the screening program 
were automatically granted refugee status and are awaiting resettlement 
overseas. About 4,500 have been resettled in third countries, mainly the United 
States and Canada.

BAKER COMMENT ON BACKING SOVIETS NOW CALLED 'HYPOTHETICAL'

<P>
After almost a week of silence, the White House seemed to dismiss as 
hypothetical Thursday a remarkable statement by Secretary of State James A. 
Baker III that offered support to the Soviet Union if it sent troops into 
Romania. 
</P>
<P>
"Baker was responding to a hypothetical situation that became more and more 
hypothetical thereafter," a White House spokesman said. "He (Baker) was not 
making a planned statement of policy." 
</P>
<P>
Baker's comment, made on a television interview program last weekend, caused 
some embarrassment in the State Department and sent a ripple of amazement 
through the foreign policy community, where such high-level endorsement for a 
Soviet military intervention was seen as unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, one Administration official indicated that Baker's statement was 
made off the cuff without consulting his staff. 
</P>
<P>
The White House continued to decline to say directly whether President Bush 
agreed with the position. However, a presidential aide said, "I'm not sure that 
if asked today, he (Baker) would answer the question the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Baker was replying to a question on the "Meet the Press" program on the NBC 
television network about the bloody fighting between the Romanian army, which 
supported the new reform government, and security forces loyal to deposed 
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
"We would support efforts to assist the Popular Front for National Salvation 
there in Romania. . . . So, I think that we would be inclined, probably, to 
follow the lead -- follow the example -- of France, who, today, has said that 
if the Warsaw Pact felt it necessary to intervene on behalf of the opposition, 
that it would support that action." 
</P>
<P>
Asked directly if he would support Soviet intervention against the Ceausescu 
forces, Baker replied, "That would be my view, yes." 
</P>
<P>
The remark was soon eclipsed by the Romania army's defeat of the security 
forces and the arrest and execution of Ceausescu. Also, the Romanians had said 
that they wanted no Soviet military help and the Soviets said that they had no 
intention of intervening. But the words may well come back to haunt the United 
States one day if the Soviet Union turns into a less stabilizing force in 
Eastern Europe than Baker now apparently considers it. 
</P>
<P>
To some degree, Baker's remarks seemed an extension of a similar statement he 
made several weeks earlier regarding unrest in the Soviet Union. He had 
indicated sympathy in case Moscow used force in some circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The United States would be understanding, he said, if the Soviets imposed 
martial law to prevent hostile ethnic groups, such as Armenians and 
Azerbaijanis, from killing each other. On the other hand, "we would have great 
trouble," he said, if peaceful demonstrators were crushed by Red Army tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a former senior official in the Richard M. Nixon 
Administration who is now at the Brookings Institution think-tank, said that 
"Baker seems obsessed with stability and with the idea that only the Soviets 
can keep order in Eastern Europe. This is the second time he seemed to invite 
the Soviets to use force, and I find his statements uncalled for, unnecessary 
and unwise." 
</P>
<P>
Sonnenfeldt, who himself once was accused of seeing too much good in the order 
enforced by the Soviets in Eastern Europe, said that "we shouldn't give the 
Soviets a blank check," as Baker appeared to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Their reputation for intervention is bad, whatever their present behavior, so 
let's not assume they are the policemen for that part of the world. Let's not 
cling to that anachronism," he said.

ROMANIA HAD ITS REBIRTH IN A TELEVISION STUDIO; 
</P>
<P>
REBELLION: PLACE WHERE REBEL LEADERS ANNOUNCED THAT CEAUSESCU HAD FLED STANDS 
AS SYMBOL OF MEDIUM'S POWER.

<P>
The birth of the new Romanian nation took place at 2:30 p.m. Friday, Dec. 22, 
in Studio No. 4 of the National Television building here. 
</P>
<P>
That was when the rebel leaders went on the air to announce that the dictator 
Nicolae Ceausescu, under siege in the Communist Party headquarters in central 
Bucharest, had fled for his life. 
</P>
<P>
One week later, the squat, two-story studio building in a residential 
neighborhood of Bucharest has become both the unofficial seat of government and 
a pilgrimage point for thousands of Romanians who want to exercise their 
long-silenced freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
Even more, it stands as a bullet-riddled symbol of the amazing power of 
television as a vehicle for lightning-fast revolutionary change. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the heart of our revolution," Mihai Isaila, 40, a program director at 
the station, who was brimming with pride Friday as he talked with a reporter in 
the control room of Studio No. 4. "Our new life was born in this television 
studio." 
</P>
<P>
Until last weekend, television here was restricted to three hours of 
black-and-white broadcasting, mostly showing continuous footage of Ceausescu 
and his wife, Elena, as they dedicated new buildings or launched hydroelectric 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few exceptions each year was Ceausescu's birthday, Jan. 26, when the 
dictator ordered the station to broadcast sentimental folk music until midnight 
to entertain his birthday party guests. 
</P>
<P>
More than any other European leader, Ceausescu feared and hated television. 
Eighteen years ago, Romania had two channels and many hours of programming. As 
part of his notorious austerity program, however, Ceausescu reduced the 
broadcasts to the three hours of aggrandizement, with occasional innocuous 
movies. But even the movies were personally monitored by the dictator. 
</P>
<P>
One recent example came when most of the world's television networks were 
broadcasting the dramatic moments of the opening the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
"That night we were showing a German film about the life of (composer) Richard 
Strauss," recalled Isaila. "Ceausescu called up the studio in a rage. He said 
'How dare you show a German movie in times like this!' " 
</P>
<P>
As a result of his paranoid restrictions, Romanian television became the joke 
of Europe, seldom watched by anyone but Ceausescu's family. People here turned 
instead to the two channels in neighboring Bulgaria or to a channel in the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of Bulgarian television schedules were hot items on the black market 
here. The most popular children's show was a Bulgarian cartoon program. Parents 
worried that their children were not learning proper Romanian. 
</P>
<P>
Some ingenious Romanians built their own satellite dishes. Others depended on 
their videocassette recorders for news of the outside world. Romania is said to 
have one of the highest per capita concentrations of VCRs in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
All of this gave television an even greater influence during the critical hours 
of the recent uprising here. In an odd way, it was as though Ceausescu had a 
premonition that television would lead to his downfall. 
</P>
<P>
He spent so much time attempting to restrict the impact of television that in 
the end, his efforts only accentuated the significance of the events in the 
streets of Romania. 
</P>
<P>
The final irony came Thursday night when National Television broadcast the 
Charlie Chaplin classic, "The Great Dictator," a savage satire about a 
Hitler-style dictator of a country named "Tomonia." 
</P>
<P>
But in the lobby of the Inter-Continental Hotel here, hotel staff gazed 
solemnly at the screen. To them, Chaplin was not Hitler, but Ceausescu. When 
the Chaplin character ordered food shortages in the imaginary land, there were 
nervous titters among the hotel staff. 
</P>
<P>
Television station managers found "The Great Dictator" in the station's 
archives, where it had gathered dust for the 24 years of the Ceausescu rule. 
</P>
<P>
During the recent revolutionary times here, television sets were turned on 
continuously. Periodically, a poet or another famous character banned under 
Ceausescu, would appear on the screen of Free Romanian Television. 
</P>
<P>
In one moving incident, a man in the western city of Timisoara wept when he saw 
flutist Georghe Zamfir, who played a Pan-like instrument with great flair. 
Zamfir, an internationally known musician, had been banned from Romanian 
television for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, television has played a central role in the dramatic changes that have 
swept Eastern European countries in recent months. In Czechoslovakia, for 
example, a see-saw, four-day struggle took place for control of news 
broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
But in Romania, the National Television complex in Bucharest was even more 
central to the remarkable events that drove a dictator from power. All at the 
same time, the television facility here was the main battleground, rebel 
headquarters, rumor control center, and meeting site for the formation of a new 
provisional government, the National Salvation Front. 
</P>
<P>
While technicians crouched to avoid bullets in Studio No. 5, which had windows 
exposed to gunfire from Ceausescu's secret police units, a gathering of poets, 
actors, dissident Communist Party members, workers and musicians were meeting 
in Studio No. 4 to decide what they would name the new leadership. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, Ion Iliescu, a former senior Communist Party leader who had 
been demoted under the Ceausescu regime, emerged as the country's new leader. 
His selection as provisional president of the national council was announced at 
the studio Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The people in the countryside, from the Danube delta to the Transylvanian Alps, 
had a ringside seat on a revolution -- bullets and all -- on their television 
screens. 
</P>
<P>
When the television cameras captured Ceausescu being booed during a rally he 
had called on Thursday, Dec. 21, the silence of repression had been broken. On 
television, they were able to see the diminutive, hawk-faced man in a fur cap 
flail his arms in confusion. 
</P>
<P>
When actor Ion Caramitru, one of the early supporters of the revolt, first took 
the microphone at 2:30 p.m. Friday, the people learned that the dictator had 
fallen. 
</P>
<P>
The Romanian National Television complex is located in a stately residential 
neighborhood of embassies and villas in north Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
On one side of the complex, the 13-story Radio-Television Administration 
building is severely damaged, its blood-stained corridors covered with a 
blanket of fresh snow. 
</P>
<P>
The two-story television studio annex is next door, flanked on one side by a 
grove of hardwood trees. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the annex Friday, hundreds of Romanians stood patiently in a blizzard, 
waiting for their turn to have a say on the liberated airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
"I will speak first in Romanian, then in German," said Gunther Ambrosi, 57. 
Ambrosi, pastor of a small German Lutheran church in Bucharest, said his 
denomination suffered great persecution under the Ceausescu regime, which 
conducted a systematic campaign against the German minority population. 
</P>
<P>
"I will tell the people," said Ambrosi, in a black religious smock with silver 
breastplates, "we are now finally free from this terrible period of Hitler, 
Stalin and Ceausescu. It is over." 
</P>
<P>
A few hours later, he was in the studio telling interviewer Georghe Marinesco 
exactly the same thing he had voiced in the snow outside. 
</P>
<P>
Next to the control room, an orderly line of television pilgrims -- 
revolutionary army generals from Timisoara, bearded ecologists from Constance 
on the Black Sea, Hungarian-speaking students from Cluj in the Carpathian 
Mountains -- waited patiently. 
</P>
<P>
The people came here as though beckoned by an evangelist, calling them forward 
to be saved. As a result, the crowded studios brimmed with emotion and pride. 
There are more than enough technicians to man the controls, but no one wants to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
Program director Isaila was taken to the hospital Monday when he collapsed on 
the floor of the studio with cramps. He came back the next day. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to leave this place," he said. "It feels like a crime not 
to be here."

SOVIET PARTY LEADERS TO CAMPAIGN AMONG RESTIVE LITHUANIANS; 
</P>
<P>
DISSENT: GORBACHEV AND OTHERS FROM MOSCOW HOPE TO TALK WITH MOST OF THE 200,000 
COMMUNISTS IN THE BALTIC REPUBLIC TO DISSUADE THEM FROM BREAKING AWAY.

<P>
Leaders of the Soviet Communist Party, in their efforts to dissuade Lithuanian 
Communists from breaking away to form an independent party, plan to talk with 
virtually all of the 200,000 members of the Lithuanian party next month in a 
massive political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet party's general secretary, will lead 
an unprecedented peace mission that is expected to include virtually all the 
other members of the ruling Politburo and party Secretariat and most of the 
250-member, policy-making Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Just after the New Year's holiday, the leaders will begin to fan out through 
each of Lithuania's 92 cities and towns and 44 rural districts, according to 
senior party sources, for a series of meetings that will give the leadership a 
firsthand opportunity to hear why the Lithuanian Communists want to become 
independent of the parent party as well as a chance to put forth Moscow's 
argument for continued integration. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev himself is to meet with party members in Vilnius, the Lithuanian 
capital, and in Kaunas, the old capital, the sources said, and those 
discussions are likely to set the tone for the whole mission. 
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to go to the heavily Russian area near the Baltic coast 
around the Ignalina nuclear power plant and to some of the republic's Polish 
districts. The independence move has been opposed by both Russians and Poles. 
</P>
<P>
The visits, which are likely to continue for at least two weeks and end with a 
major meeting of Lithuanian party members and the Soviet leadership in Vilnius, 
are aimed at reaching a compromise that will keep the Lithuanian Communists 
within the Soviet party but with full autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee will then resume its meeting, broken off after two days 
of stormy debate, and reconsider the issue. This session might become part of 
another Central Committee meeting, planned for late January, that will focus on 
the future of the party, including its basic philosophy and organization, and 
on new directions for the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Mikhail Gorbachev will command enormous respect and exert great authority on 
the spot in Lithuania," a Central Committee official said, explaining the 
decision to send Gorbachev and other top party officials to Lithuania. "But he 
will have to answer directly to many Lithuanian Communists who have very sharp 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian Communists declared their independence from the Soviet party 
earlier this month in the first such division in the party since it came to 
power in the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Without such independence, they believe 
they stand little chance of retaining power in the republic in the multi-party 
elections to be held there in two months. 
</P>
<P>
Their challenge to the Soviet leadership, however, calls into question not only 
the unity of the party but also, in time, the unity of the Soviet state -- and 
as a result it has thrust the country into a major political crisis, the 
outcome of which is highly uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a struggle to save perestroika (Gorbachev's political and economic 
restructuring), nothing less," a senior Central Committee official commented. 
"The Lithuanian move is seen as the first step toward schism, and as such it is 
a heavy blow to Mikhail Gorbachev . . . . Very much, really everything, is now 
at stake in Lithuania, and we must make a maximum effort if we are to preserve 
perestroika and move ahead." 
</P>
<P>
The mission will work on two political levels at once -- persuading the 
Lithuanians to remain within the Soviet party in order to preserve and develop 
Gorbachev's reforms and convincing conservatives and even some liberals from 
outside Lithuania of the need to reshape the party to meet the people's needs 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Top party leaders believe, these officials say, that many Lithuanians will 
rethink their decision to establish an independent party once they realize the 
implications of that move for themselves and the rest of the Soviet Union, when 
they are reassured of Gorbachev's commitment to broaden his reforms and give 
them full autonomy and when they are free from local nationalist pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"We will try to create a situation in which people can freely state their views 
without fear and without pressure," an official said. "If they remain 
determined to break away, then we have a new, more profound dilemma, one for 
which we do not yet have an answer. 
</P>
<P>
"We know, however, that it is absolutely impossible to force a solution. Only a 
democratic decision, taken within a normal political struggle, can resolve this 
crisis."

NEW REGIME REVOKES CEAUSESCU POLICIES;

<P>
The new provisional Romanian government moved quickly Friday to consolidate its 
authority throughout the country, naming new ministers and revoking policies of 
the regime of executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
The army reported that the country was now fully under its control, although 
pockets of resistance by the fanatical presidential guard called the Securitate 
remained. 
</P>
<P>
In a decree published in Friday's edition of Romania Libera, the National 
Salvation Front issued an eight-point program, amplifying the first published 
statement of its intentions since it was established one week ago. 
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, the leading role of the Communist Party will be abolished, 
overturning 40 years of one-party rule here -- a rule that was dominated for 
the last 20 years by an all-embracing police apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
The National Salvation Front repeated its commitment to hold free elections in 
April, stipulating that under the new system, senior office holders would not 
be able to serve more than two terms. 
</P>
<P>
The new Romanian flag will be the traditional red, gold and blue tricolor, but 
with the Communist symbol removed from its center. 
</P>
<P>
The new Romanian economy, the decree said, will be based on "efficiency and 
profitability," which many observers believe is a recipe for a free-market 
system and the dismantling of a highly centralized economy built up by the 
Ceausescu regime. 
</P>
<P>
Ion Iliescu, the provisional Romanian leader, appointed Gen. Atanasie Victor 
Stanculescu minister of the economy. Although some Romanians on Friday 
criticized the choice of an army officer as chief economics minister, Corneliu 
Bogdan, the government's spokesman, said Stanculescu had been minister of 
supply under the former regime and was qualified for the job because of his 
knowledge in the area of supply, logistics and warehousing. 
</P>
<P>
As a gesture toward the ethnic German and Hungarian minorities -- 200,000 and 
1.6 million, respectively -- the front said that rights for minorities would be 
protected. It also said it would fully respect religious rights and adhere to 
the human rights agreements of the Helsinki accords. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Ceausescu regime, Hungarian language schools, newspapers and books 
were either decreased in number or closed down entirely. It was a policy aimed 
at "Romanianizing" the ethnic minorities and diluting their cultural and 
political strength. Ceausescu's policy toward the Hungarian minority brought 
him to diplomatic loggerheads with Hungary, nominally a Warsaw Pact ally. 
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Germans, centered around Romania's second-largest city of Brasov, 
were deprived of similar rights, but unlike the Hungarians, who until recently 
could not seek refuge in Hungary, the West German government bought the freedom 
of any German who wanted to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The National Salvation Front, as has many non-Communist or reformist 
governments in the East Bloc, expressed concern for the environment, pledging 
to halt investments in industries that could be ecologically damaging. 
</P>
<P>
The government decree also subordinated to the government the military and 
police.

PANEL TO STUDY MERCURY THREAT TO FLORIDA WILDLIFE, RURAL AREAS

Gov. Bob Martinez signed an executive order Friday setting up a task force to 
coordinate study of the mercury contamination that is threatening the state's 
rural environment. 
</P>
<P>
Elevated levels of the toxic metal have been found in wildlife such as Florida 
panthers, alligators, largemouth bass and turtles throughout the state, said 
Forrest Ware, chief of the research bureau of the Florida Game and Fresh Water 
Fish Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"Mercury contamination could pose a very real, very dangerous threat to public 
health, and we can't sit back and just hope for things to get better," the 
governor said. 
</P>
<P>
The task force is to report to Martinez by March 1 with a plan to deal with the 
contamination, including possible solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we're just identifying problems right now. Then we can get to the 
how and why," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials have warned people of possible contamination in at least eight 
rivers across the state, including the St. Johns, Suwannee and Yellow, as well 
as Lakes Kissimmee and Tohopekaliga. 
</P>
<P>
In the Everglades, mercury was blamed for the death of a 4-year-old Florida 
panther earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't even looked at the birds yet or the marine life," Ware said. "This 
has to be investigated."

MOYNIHAN URGES SOCIAL SECURITY TAX CUT, RETURN TO PAY-AS-YOU-GO BENEFITS SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A key senator Friday advocated cuts in the Social Security payroll tax that 
would save 130 million workers and employers a total of $62 billion during the 
next two years. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (Y.) would cancel a 0.14% increase 
in the levy scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1 and would lower the rate by an 
additional 0.96% for workers and employers in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan, who as chairman of the Senate Finance subcommittee on Social Security 
is in a crucial position to advance his plan, said that it would put the 
retirement system back on a pay-as-you-go basis instead of amassing trust fund 
surpluses exceeding $200 billion in the coming decade. 
</P>
<P>
"The Administration is content to see the budget deficit gradually eliminated 
by the growing Social Security tax revenue," Moynihan said at a news 
conference. "This . . . perverts the original purpose for the surpluses -- to 
provide for the retirement of the baby boom (generation) in the next century." 
</P>
<P>
The trust fund concept was adopted in 1983 to accumulate reserves in advance of 
the huge demands expected on Social Security when members of the baby boom 
generation born after the end of World War II begin to retire in the early part 
of the next century. But Moynihan and others said that the huge surpluses have 
been used instead to mask the size of the federal deficit. Without the 
surpluses, Congress and the Administration would have to make more drastic 
spending cuts or generate new revenue to meet deficit reduction targets. 
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer tolerate the use of Social Security surpluses to finance, 
say, B-2 bombers or a capital gains tax cut," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The deficit for fiscal 1989, Moynihan said, would be $204 billion instead of 
$152 billion if the Social Security surplus had not been counted. Congressional 
Budget Office projections show the Social Security surplus rising to $236 
billion in the year 2000, virtually concealing a deficit of $268 billion in 
other government transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is strong support in the Senate for excluding the trust fund 
surpluses in calculating the budget deficit, President Bush has opposed any 
change in the current accounting system. He is also expected to oppose 
Moynihan's proposed cut in the payroll tax because of revenue losses estimated 
at $7 billion next year and $55 billion in 1991. The fate of the proposal is 
difficult to predict. 
</P>
<P>
The 7.65% tax -- including 1.45% for Medicare, which everyone pays -- will be 
imposed next year on both workers and employers on all earnings up to a cutoff 
of $51,300, with a maximum tax of $3,924 for each. 
</P>
<P>
Moynihan contends that it is unfair tax policy to rely so heavily on a payroll 
tax that allows no deductions and takes the same percentage from everyone 
regardless of their ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States almost certainly now has the most regressive tax structure 
of any Western nation," he said. "This is so because the Social Security 
payroll tax -- which is decidely regressive -- has come to make up an 
increasingly larger share of total federal tax levies." 
</P>
<P>
About three-fourths of all wage-earners, he said, will pay more in Social 
Security taxes in 1990 than they will pay in federal income taxes, which are 
more geared to the ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation that Moynihan will introduce when Congress reconvenes in 
late January, an increase in the Social Security payroll tax to 7.65% from 
7.51%, due to take effect Monday, would be repealed. 
</P>
<P>
If the 1990 tax is held at the 1989 rate of 7.51%, the savings for those paying 
the maximum would be about $72. In 1991, those earning more than the estimated 
maximum wage base of $54,300 would pay about $600 less than they are scheduled 
to do if the law is unchanged, Moynihan said. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1991, the tax rate would be lowered to 6.55% under the Moynihan 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
With the changes, Moynihan said, the nation's basic retirement system would 
revert to financing on a pay-as-you-go basis -- or setting the tax rate at the 
lowest level needed to produce enough revenues for current benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"This approach will eliminate the current regressive financing of the budget 
deficit, while keeping Social Security on a sound financial basis," the senator 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert J. Myers, who was chief actuary of the Social Security system for nearly 
a quarter of a century, has advocated a return to pay-as-you-go financing, the 
method used for decades to provide payments to beneficiaries.

NORTH SALUTED AS NARRATOR OF 'PETER, WOLF'

Iran-Contra figure Oliver L. North won hearty applause for his musical stage 
debut Friday night as narrator of "Peter and the Wolf," but among the 
youngsters in the audience he was clearly upstaged by the wolf. 
</P>
<P>
"It was right nice," said Aquil Robinson, 12. "What I liked best was when the 
wolf ate the duck." 
</P>
<P>
North, 46, who is appealing his May 4 conviction on three felony charges in 
connection with the Iran-Contra affair, accepted an invitation from Maria 
Fisher, president of the Beethoven Society, to read the narration for Sergei 
Prokofiev's musical tale for children. 
</P>
<P>
The retired Marine colonel and former White House national security aide wore a 
tuxedo for his half-hour performance in the main ballroom of a downtown hotel 
before about 1,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
The audience included North's probation officer, Ralph Ardito, and 100 
inner-city children from the Save Our Youth anti-drug program in Washington, 
where North is serving his sentence of 1,200 hours of community service. He 
also was given two years' probation and fined $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
North read with lively expression and never missed a cue from the orchestra 
conductor. He said it was his first stage appearance since he played "the bad 
guy" in a high school production of "How the West Was Won" in his hometown of 
Philmont, N.Y., nearly 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It was wonderful," said former North associate Robert W. Owen, who saw the 
show with his 2-year-old daughter Katie. "Ollie may have a new profession," 
said Owen, who once served as North's liaison with the Nicaraguan Contras. 
</P>
<P>
"He was very good," said conductor Richard Weilenmann. "Some narrators are 
exaggerated and overblown, but North read very naturally, as if he were reading 
to his own children." 
</P>
<P>
North, who reportedly charges $25,000 for every speech he makes, narrated 
"Peter and the Wolf" for free, Mrs. Fisher said.

SOUTHWEST HIT BY HEAVY SNOW AS COLD PERSISTS IN NEW ENGLAND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Heavy snow fell Friday in the Southwest and forecasters posted winter storm 
warnings for the mountains of Arizona. Record cold chilled New England but 
cloudy skies helped raise the mercury in the frost-bitten Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Rain moved into Texas but did not ease the state's fire danger, caused by a dry 
spell. 
</P>
<P>
The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning for the Mogollon Rim 
and the White Mountains in north-central Arizona. An advisory for snow was 
posted over the higher elevations in the rest of the state's northern half. 
</P>
<P>
In a six-hour period Friday morning, 9 inches of snow was recorded at 
Flagstaff, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Eight inches fell at Sacramento Mountain in New Mexico and 4 inches was 
reported at Ruidoso and Cloudcroft. 
</P>
<P>
Cold air clung to New England. Temperatures were in the mid-teens with a 
subzero wind chill in Boston early Friday, and it was 4 below in Houlton, Me. 
</P>
<P>
Friday was the 22nd day in a row that the mercury at Portland, Me., had not 
gone above 32 degrees -- the longest duration of freezing temperatures in the 
city in 50 years of record-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
The weather service said that temperatures from Illinois south remained in the 
mid to upper 30s overnight as clouds insulating much of the Midwest and upper 
Great Lakes states kept temperatures well above zero. The region had been 
particularly hard hit by the cold wave that numbed much of the nation in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But freezing rain moved into southeast Michigan and parts of Illinois, 
Wisconsin and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Rain from Louisiana moved east into Texas on Friday, dampening some areas but 
not easing the fire danger caused by a dry spell in the Lone Star State. The 
Texas Forest Service expanded its outdoor burning ban farther south to include 
a wide area between San Antonio and the Gulf Coast.

EIGHTH DELAY ORDERED FOR TITAN 3 BECAUSE WINDS AGAIN ARE TOO HIGH 
</P>

<P>
The maiden launching of a Titan 3 rocket carrying British and Japanese 
communications satellites was postponed Friday for another 24 hours because of 
high winds aloft, the eighth delay in 22 days for the hard-luck flight. 
</P>
<P>
The $100-million rocket, the most powerful U.S. booster ever built as a 
commercial venture, had been scheduled for liftoff from launching complex 40. 
But the countdown was held at the T-minus-five-minute mark because of concern 
about upper-altitude winds. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with rocket-builder Martin Marietta Astronautics Group then ordered a 
24-hour delay. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's launch has been scrubbed because of high upper winds," company 
spokesman Robert Gordon said. "The launch will be rescheduled for tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
The goal of the long-awaited launching is the deployment of Skynet 4A, a 
British military communications satellite, and JCSat 2, a $150-million 
communications satellite owned by the Japan Communications Satellite Co. and 
Hughes Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The debut of the Titan 3 was scheduled for Dec. 7, but a computer programming 
problem forced Martin Marietta officials to order a 24-hour delay. The next six 
takeoff dates were missed because of bad weather, primarily 
higher-than-allowable winds aloft. 
</P>
<P>
The first Titan 3 mission marks a milestone in the nation's post-Challenger 
effort to build a commercial launching industry to compete with the European 
Ariane rocket and others being marketed by China and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan banned commercial satellites from the shuttle in 
the wake of the 1986 Challenger explosion -- creating a large backlog of 
cargoes with no way to get into space -- to encourage development of a 
private-sector launching industry.

PRAYERS WERE SAID, CARS WERE WASHED -- AND SNOW FINALLY ARRIVED 
</P>

In the midst of a snowless winter in the San Gabriel Mountains, some turn to 
car-washing. "It's kind of a local tradition," said Cliff Fowler, owner of Big 
Bear Sporting Goods Store. "When it's late in the season and there hasn't been 
any snowfall, we organize a car-washing campaign. As soon as everybody gets 
their cars spit-shiny, the snow is bound to come and cover them all up." 
</P>
<P>
So, earlier this week, Fowler spent an evening cleaning and waxing his car. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the equivalent to a rain dance, I guess. Whatever, it works," he said as 
he looked out at the six inches of snow that had accumulated in front of his 
store since early Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first major snowfall of the winter in Southern California, covering 
some mountain areas with up to a foot of what some of the 14,000 residents in 
Big Bear Lake refer to as "the white stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Slight flurries Thursday had raised the hopes of Big Bear residents. But by 
nightfall, the sky had cleared and weather forecasts mentioned only a 20% 
chance of rain showers. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of praying that it would get more serious," said Jim 
Bollingmo, owner of Alpine Sports Center and a resident in Big Bear Lake for 28 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Then, moisture from a low-pressure system that had already passed over Southern 
California unexpectedly doubled back into the mountains and dropped six to 12 
inches of cover. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of hollering this morning," Bollingmo said. "When people came 
outside and saw the snow, the cheering was a lot like a football game." 
</P>
<P>
Bollingmo said the sales pace at his sporting goods business has been 
"absolutely nuts." 
</P>
<P>
Tire chains, ski gloves and after-ski boots are the top-selling items, the 
owner said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the kind of thing we pray for in my business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us hope for snow," said Elaine Swope, manager of the Marina Riviera 
Resort in Big Bear Lake. "It does boost our business, but it is more than just 
that. I don't know what it is about snow. It just makes everybody so excited." 
</P>
<P>
Friday's snow was unexpected, said Rick Dittmann, a meteorologist with 
WeatherData Inc., which provides The Times with weather forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
The snowfall was expected to taper off by late Friday, he said.

A helicopter apparently lost a rotor before crashing in a rental car parking 
lot during takeoff at the Sonoma County Airport on Friday, injuring four of the 
five people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
The helicopter was taking off when it stalled and fell 50 feet into an Avis car 
rental lot near the airport firehouse, crushing one vehicle, an airport control 
tower spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It landed right on top of one of our cars, totaling it and damaging a couple 
of others," said Patty Stephens, manager at Avis. "The rotor came off the 
helicopter and one propeller hit the terminal seconds before the crash." 
</P>
<P>
She said the small terminal area was crowded with people waiting for the 
arrival of a 90-passenger jetliner from Los Angeles when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
There was no fire, and those aboard the chopper were quickly rushed to two 
local hospitals. One person refused treatment and four others were admitted, 
two with major injuries, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff's Department. 
Their identities were not released.

Mexican authorities are doing their best to ensure that drug kingpin Rafael 
Caro Quintero, recently sentenced to 40 years in jail, will spend New Year's 
with his family. For the second time in two days, the attorney general's office 
announced the arrest on drug trafficking charges of a relative of Caro 
Quintero, sentenced for the 1985 murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
agent Enrique Camarena. Police arrested Victor Elevier Caro Fonseca, Caro 
Quintero's nephew, for possession of nine pounds of cocaine in a small town 
near Guadalajara, an office spokesman said.

The body of a a French citizen killed when a relief plane was shot down Dec. 21 
in southern Sudan exploded at the airport in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, as 
it was about to be loaded on a plane for Paris. Sources who reported the 
incident said they believed the body had been booby-trapped to explode in the 
air. The blast burned the driver of the truck carrying the body. Four relief 
workers died when their plane was downed in a rebel area near Aweil, about 590 
miles southwest of Khartoum.

The commanding general at Ft. Sill, Okla., dismissed charges against two 
soldiers accused of causing the Sept. 27 artillery accident that killed three 
soldiers, including Spec. Thomas P. Boyle of Ventura, Calif. Maj. Gen. Raphael 
J. Hallada said he concluded that the accident, in which a round overshot its 
target and struck a group of soldiers, was the result of human error and not 
the result of a criminal act. Sgt. Edward C. Tyler of Washington, D.C., and 
Spec. Nickoles W. Holly of Canton, Ohio, had been accused of dereliction of 
duty and negligent homicide.

Frank Lloyd Wright supporters have asked Marin County officials to redesign a 
proposed $23-million jail rather than "denigrate" the memory of the renowned 
architect. The two-story, 219-cell jail would go up in front of one of Wright's 
most famous works -- the Marin County Civic Center, whose pale pink arches 
sweep across three small knolls along busy U.S. 101. It is the only government 
building Wright designed. Former colleagues of Wright wrote to the county Board 
of Supervisors last week, saying they were appalled by the rectangular jail 
design and asking that it be redone to harmonize with Wright's building. County 
supervisors called it unlikely that the design will be significantly changed.

An 11-year-old Rancho Palos Verdes boy buried up to his neck in a 
quicksand-like muck near Koehn Dry Lake was rescued in good condition after a 
four-hour desert ordeal. Firefighters were called in Thursday afternoon after 
it was determined the thick mud's suction prevented John Connett from working 
himself free. The boy was then taken by helicopter to Antelope Valley Hospital 
and Medical Center in Palmdale, where he was treated for exposure and released. 
Connett and his father had been riding on three-wheel off-road vehicles when 
the boy became stuck up to his kneecaps in the muck in the lake bed area 20 
miles north of California City. By the time his father returned with help, the 
boy was up to his neck.

Forest fire smoke from four summers ago in the Tahoe Basin greatly stimulated 
algae growth in the lake, longtime Tahoe researcher Charles Goldman said. 
Nutrients in the smoke particles probably caused the increase in algae 
production, he said. He plans follow-up research on possible links between wood 
smoke and declining clarity of the lake's water. The California Air Resources 
board recently adopted a rule to remove inefficient wood stoves at the time of 
home sales and to speed up enforcement of federal stove emission standards 
taking effect in 1992.

TV CATCHES PEP TALK AS HOLTZ RIPS COLORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

MIAMI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Through the wizardry of videotape and the absent-mindedness of Lou Holtz, a 
sometimes scathing pep talk meant only for the ears of Notre Dame players 
became the center of attention Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the viewers of Denver-based KCNC-TV were treated to the footage late 
Thursday evening, but it wasn't until Friday morning that transcripts of 
Holtz's impromptu speech, made shortly before a Thursday afternoon practice 
session, were circulated among the assembled Orange Bowl media and, of course, 
distributed to an irate University of Colorado football team. 
</P>
<P>
According to the videotape transcript, Holtz intimated that comments attributed 
to Notre Dame players, specifically quarterback Tony Rice, were being twisted 
and tailored to fit the motivational needs of the Colorado team. Holtz also 
suggested that this wasn't the first time a Colorado opponent's quotes had been 
used to the Buffaloes' advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you what. . . . They've been living a lie," Holtz told his players 
Thursday. "They've been living a lie all year. Remember I told you . . . The 
coaches had problems withIllinois. They're over there telling 'em you guys say 
this, you saying that. That's fine. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't be any more (sky) high than what they're going to be. But we just 
have to make sure we take care of our football team. They're expecting an 
outstanding football team and they're going to see one. They're going to see 
the best Notre Dame (unintelligible) . . . And we're going to whip 'em." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz didn't stop there. In a departure from his public stance, he told his 
team that a victory over Colorado Monday night would guarantee the Irish a 
second consecutive national championship. 
</P>
<P>
"The bad of it is Colorado feels they're being slighted," he said that day. 
"They're going to be sky high and they don't get any respect and all that other 
nonsense. The good thing is, it sends a message to everybody who votes that 
after we win the football game, they can't do anything else but put Notre Dame 
No. 1. They can't, believe me." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz then listed the reasons why a Notre Dame victory was so plausible. 
</P>
<P>
"Number one, (Colorado is) used to scoring a lot of points," he said. "They 
ain't playing any Kansas State. We got to be patient on defense, just play our 
football game. On offense, we want to control the football. All we want (is) a 
first down, first down, first down. Frustration will set in on Colorado's 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"By the middle of the third quarter, they will leave the game plan completely 
and start grab-bagging. Remember me telling you that. They are not patient. 
(Their) quarterback will want to make plays and we aren't going to let him. 
Stop the bomb, control the quarterback. Those are two critical things along 
with the five areas we told you." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Holtz began the process of damage control. He said he was unaware of 
the TV crew's presence at the workout, which was open to the media for 15 
minutes, and that his earlier comments weren't intended to demean the Colorado 
coaching staff or team. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to do anything where it would hurt or be derogatory to Colorado, 
and if that's the way it's interpreted, I sincerely apologize, because that 
wasn't the intention," he said. "The intention was to make our players aware of 
the various things that were being said and also to put their minds at ease 
that we could win the football game." 
</P>
<P>
He also said several of his remarks have been taken out of context. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't in reference to Colorado lies, or anything else along that line," 
Holtz said. "But sometimes things are said or put in the paper that really 
aren't accurate along that line. I just wanted our players to understand that." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz was referring to a midweek quote attributed to Rice in which the Notre 
Dame quarterback allegedly said that his team wanted to get another win under 
its belt, as if to imply that Colorado posed little challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"An out and out lie. (Rice) didn't say that," Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
At an Orange Bowl Hall of Fame luncheon earlier in the day, Holtz explained his 
pep-talk comments to Colorado Coach Bill McCartney. Asked later if he would 
share the conversation with reporters, Holtz said, "I assumed it was taped." 
</P>
<P>
All in all, it wasn't a banner day for Holtz. At that same luncheon, Holtz 
mistakenly told an audience of about 1,400 Orange Bowl supporters that Colorado 
was quarterbacked by Sal Aunese. 
</P>
<P>
Prodded by master of ceremonies Bob Griese to list several Notre Dame 
negatives, McCartney knew just where to start. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, they don't know who our quarterback is," he said. "Our 
quarterback is not Sal Aunese, he's dead. Our quarterback is Darian Hagan. 
They're in trouble right there because they're going to think we only have 10 
guys on the field." 
</P>
<P>
Aunese died earlier this fall after a bout with stomach cancer. 
</P>
<P>
It clearly wasn't Holtz's finest moment. Nor have these been his finest 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot more problems today than I did yesterday," he said later. 
</P>
<P>
No one disagreed.

WASHINGTON, FLORIDA TO SETTLE DIFFERENCES; 
</P>
<P>
FREEDOM BOWL: THE HUSKIES WILL PASS AND THE GATORS WILL RUN IN GAME AT ANAHEIM 
STADIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Washington and Florida, two football teams with very little in common, will 
meet today in the Freedom Bowl at 11 a.m. at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
About the only similarity is the 7-4 record each team has posted this season. 
</P>
<P>
The differences are many: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Washington relies heavily on its passing game. Florida likes to run. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Washington has a two-year starter at quarterback, Cary Conklin, who is the 
school-record holder for passing yardage in a season. Florida alternates 
freshmen quarterbacks Lex Smith and Donald Douglas. Gary Darnell, the Gators' 
interim coach, isn't saying who will start. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don James, in his 15th season at Washington, is the dean of Pacific 10 
coaches. Darnell is in his seventh, and most likely last, game as Florida's 
interim coach. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Washington has gone through the season in routine fashion. Florida has 
endured a scandal-ridden season, marked by charges of assault, drug use, 
gambling and illegal payoffs against Gator players and former coach Galen Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Washington began by losing three of its first five games. Florida finished 
by losing three of its last four. 
</P>
<P>
The teams will meet for the first time against this contrasting backdrop in the 
first Freedom Bowl to be played in the daylight and on network television -- 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
The most recognizable difference between the teams will be their offensive 
styles. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's one-back, NFL-style offense features Conklin at quarterback and 
Andre Riley at wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
Conklin, a senior, threw for 2,569 yards to break Sonny Sixkiller's school 
record of 2,303 set in 1970. He threw for 16 touchdowns, but 17 interceptions. 
He threw for a Washington-record 428 yards against Arizona State, but the 
Huskies lost, 34-32. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, a senior who suffered a serious knee injury last season, caught 53 
passes for 1,039 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to move the ball," James said. "We can't allow (Florida) to hang 
onto the ball for 90 snaps. I don't think we can give up the big plays." 
</P>
<P>
Florida's offense has revolved around Emmitt Smith, a junior running back who 
has rushed for 1,599 yards, second-highest in school history. Twice, Smith has 
finished in the top 10 in the Heisman Trophy balloting. 
</P>
<P>
Even before quarterback Kyle Morris was suspended from school for betting on 
professional and college football games, the Gators relied on Smith's running. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? His average of 126 rushing yards a game ranks second in 
Southeastern Conference history. Only Herschel Walker averaged more yards a 
game (159.4 while at Georgia). 
</P>
<P>
Darnell, who took over when Hall resigned Oct. 8 in the face of charges he made 
payoffs to assistant coaches in 1986-88 and to a player in 1987, is probably 
coaching his final game as Florida's head man. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Spurrier, a Heisman Trophy winner while Florida's quarterback in 1966 and 
the current Duke coach, will reportedly be named the new Gator coach. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, James has been impressed by what Darnell has done. 
</P>
<P>
"To have a person go into a situation like that and keep the guys from 
fragmenting is really something," James said. "I think (if Darnell doesn't stay 
at Florida), he's going to be at the top of people's lists." 
</P>
<P>
Freedom Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
There is one other similarity: Each team has a number of players looking to 
improve their status in the eyes of NFL scouts. For Washington, it's 
quarterback Cary Conklin and defensive tackle Dennis Brown. For Florida, it's 
running back Emmitt Smith. "It's important for me to move up and increase my 
value," Conklin said, "but I've had a pretty solid year, so I don't think this 
game is going to make or break it." Brown was thought to be an All-American 
candidate when the season began but failed to live up to expectations. Conklin 
and Husky wide receiver Andre Riley will play in the Hula Bowl. Brown will play 
in the East-West Shrine game. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors abound concerning Smith's possible jump to the NFL. Smith has not 
announced his decision. "I do want, as I said as a freshman, to win the Heisman 
Trophy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This is Washington's second appearance in the Freedom Bowl. The Huskies 
defeated Colorado, 20-17, in 1985.

CONKLIN DISCOVERED OFFENSE WAS HARDER TO STOP THAN LEARN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington quarterback Cary Conklin walked out to practice one day last spring 
and tried to make sense of Coach Don James' new offense. 
</P>
<P>
The one-back, the quick-pass, whatever the name, quickly became an enormous 
pain for Conklin. On the first day of spring practice, someone handed Conklin a 
new playbook, pointed to a set of receivers he'd never seen and said, "Now get 
to work, son." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the offense is a quarterback's dream. Washington State had used it 
successfully under Dennis Erickson before he took it to Miami this year. 
</P>
<P>
The offense gives the quarterback as many as five receivers, including the 
fullback, in short to medium range and, as Conklin soon learned, is difficult 
to defend against. 
</P>
<P>
And James, unhappy after a 6-5 season in which the Huskies missed a bowl game 
for the first time in nearly a decade, junked the I-formation in favor of the 
wide-open, one-back passing game. 
</P>
<P>
James also fired offensive line coach Dan Dorazio and replaced him with Keith 
Gilbertson, who added some flair to an offense that ranked seventh in the 
Pacific 10 in 1988. Gilbertson, the head coach at Idaho for three seasons, was 
among the first to develop the one-back offense. 
</P>
<P>
Conklin couldn't have been happier, at least until it came time to work out. 
</P>
<P>
A knee injury sidelined Andre Riley, the only veteran receiver. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, we didn't know if we were doing the smart thing (changing the 
offense)," James said. "He was throwing to a lot of new faces." 
</P>
<P>
After a lengthy period of adjustment, Conklin became comfortable with the 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, we had to learn it because we had a game in a few days," Conklin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A school-record 2,569 passing yards later, Conklin has finally mastered the 
one-back offense, having led Washington to a 7-4 record and a spot in the 
Freedom Bowl against Florida this morning at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
His passing yardage broke Sonny Sixkiller's single-season school record of 
2,303 set in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Sixkiller's record stood through almost 20 years of outstanding Washington 
quarterbacks. Warren Moon couldn't break it, neither could Chris Chandler, Tom 
Flick, Hugh Millen or Steve Pelluer. 
</P>
<P>
"When we recruited (Conklin), he looked a lot like the rest of the kids we've 
had success with," James said. "Moon, Flick . . . he's as good as any of them." 
</P>
<P>
Conklin, 6-feet-4 and 215 pounds from Yakima, Wash., is quick to credit the 
Huskies' new offense for his record-breaking season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the offense of the '90s," Conklin said. "They (defenses) don't 
know when you're going to throw the quick game at them or go with the longer 
stuff. Usually we have four receivers and one running back, but sometimes we 
have five receivers and no running back. The whole idea is to mix it up with 
the run. It's a fun offense to watch." 
</P>
<P>
And, to hear Conklin tell it, an exciting one to play. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to stop," he said. "No one really stopped it all year. The only time 
we were stopped was when we stopped ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Said James: "Any quarterback who's a thrower would like it. If he just had 
another year with the offense . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Conklin is a fourth-year senior, which is rare in these days of 
redshirt-mania. 
</P>
<P>
James and Conklin had agreed that the quarterback would redshirt for his 
sophomore season in 1987. But when Chandler was injured the week of the Arizona 
game, James had to activate Conklin. 
</P>
<P>
The game ended in a 21-21 tie with Conklin passing for two touchdowns. It was 
just the confidence boost he needed. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since that game, I knew I had the ability," Conklin said. "The last two 
years I've been real successful and it goes back to that game." 
</P>
<P>
Conklin remembers having mixed feelings before the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to ruin my redshirt year," he said. "But then again I was tired 
of practicing. I wanted to get out there and show what I could do." 
</P>
<P>
Chandler returned to the lineup quickly, and Conklin was back on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
But there was little question who the starter would be after Chandler 
graduated. 
</P>
<P>
As a junior, Conklin passed for 1,883 yards but the Huskies had a disappointing 
6-5 season. 
</P>
<P>
But his senior year began under happier circumstances. In the opening game, the 
Huskies upset 15th-ranked Texas A&amp;M as Conklin completed 23 of 37 passes 
for 224 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The year has not been without pitfalls, however. Washington lost three 
consecutive games before meeting Oregon in mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 14-14, in the third quarter, Washington had possession on 
the Ducks' one-yard line. Conklin, trying to wriggle his way into the end zone 
on an option, caught his foot in the artificial turf as he spun and pulled a 
lower abdominal muscle. 
</P>
<P>
Washington won, 20-14, but Conklin was hurting for the next month. 
</P>
<P>
"I could barely walk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Conklin played anyway, leading Washington to four victories in the final five 
games to gain a berth in the Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of Conklin's season was a 28-27 win over UCLA. Still bothered by 
the pulled muscle, he played poorly in the first quarter as the Huskies 
trailed, 21-0, before rallying in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 27-21, with 3:12 remaining, Conklin led the Huskies to the winning 
touchdown on a 78-yard, 10-play drive. He completed five of seven passes on the 
march, which ended on Greg Lewis' 10-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
"I just got in the huddle and said, 'Somebody's got to come up with some big 
plays,' " Conklin said. "There was never any doubt in my mind we'd score." 
</P>
<P>
That's just an example of Conklin's confidence, according to Riley. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the poise he has, the self-confidence in the pocket that makes him so 
good," said Riley, Washington's leading receiver this season with 53 catches 
for 1,039 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Since that Arizona game in his sophomore season, Conklin's confidence has never 
wavered through offenses, old or new. It just took time to adjust to the new 
one.

IF IRISH DEFEAT BUFFALOES, THEY COULD RATE A SHOT AT NO. 1

<P>
Colorado could simplify the voting process in the final Associated Press and 
United Press International college football polls by beating Notre Dame Monday 
night in the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffaloes, the current No. 1-ranked team, would remain unbeaten, and who 
really cares which teams finish second through fourth in the balloting. 
</P>
<P>
All remaining contenders -- Miami, Michigan and Notre Dame -- would have at 
least one loss. 
</P>
<P>
However, if Notre Dame beats Colorado, Miami beats Alabama in the Sugar Bowl 
and Michigan beats USC in the Rose Bowl, the voting could become more 
subjective. 
</P>
<P>
In that event, it would seem logical to elevate Miami, now ranked No. 2, to the 
top spot, considering that it already had beaten Notre Dame, which had disposed 
of the current No. 1 team, Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
However, Notre Dame, now No. 4, which has a strong national following, may get 
some support from reporters (Associated Press) and coaches (United Press 
International) for the No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
There also could be voting backlash against Miami for reasons that have nothing 
to do with results. The Hurricanes, with their swaggering and finger-pointing 
on the field and previous "convict" image, may be a distasteful choice for the 
electorate. 
</P>
<P>
Voters might be looking for any excuse not to promote Miami to No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
An indication of Notre Dame's popularity was evident in a recent USA Today 
phone-in poll. Answering the question of who is the nation's No. 1 team, 1,063 
voted for Notre Dame, 611 for Michigan, 498 for Miami and only 443 for 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler says it's "a shot in the dark" for his team to 
get the No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
However, considering that Schembechler is retiring after the Rose Bowl game and 
that he has never won a national championship in his 21 years as the 
Wolverines' coach despite an impressive record, he and his Michigan team could 
be a sentimental choice to jump from No. 3 to No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
That seems unlikely, though, because Notre Dame beat Michigan in a 
season-opening game. 
</P>
<P>
In tiebreakers for conference championships, head-to-head results are the 
determining factor. 
</P>
<P>
That is not necessarily a guideline for the voting in the wire service polls. 
</P>
<P>
Take 1978, for example. USC beat Alabama, 24-14, in the third game of the 
season and then later lost to Arizona State. Alabama didn't lose another game, 
and neither did USC. 
</P>
<P>
Since USC beat Alabama, there was an obvious tiebreaker in the voting for No. 
1. However, the AP poll selected Alabama as national champion. The UPI poll 
tabbed USC as No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
There's also the possibility that there could be split national champions again 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, the UPI poll has not recognized teams that are on NCAA probation. 
The AP poll doesn't make such a distinction. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, USC was designated national champion by UPI at the end of the season. 
Oklahoma, which was on probation, was AP's national champion. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it isn't a perfect system but one that could be settled by playoffs 
such as in college basketball. Although a playoff system has been discussed, 
and some coaches favor it, nothing has been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The major bowls are opposed to a playoff formula, figuring that it might damage 
their prestige if, say, the Rose Bowl or the Orange Bowl were designated as 
semifinal NCAA playoff games, rather than the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
One final thought: What if there are some tie games in the strategic bowl 
games? That's another problem for the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
Gamesmanship in the Orange Bowl began Dec. 22 when Colorado Coach Bill 
McCartney brought his team to Miami. Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz, whose team 
didn't arrive until Monday night, has said that preparation is difficult at a 
bowl site because of bowl-related activities and distractions. 
</P>
<P>
"All you try to do is control damage," Holtz said. "You don't even know if the 
ball is blown up or stuffed." 
</P>
<P>
McCartney interpreted Holtz's comments as second-guessing. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Holtz questions our strategy in coming down here early and spending time 
with the beautiful people of Miami," McCartney said. "I don't understand that. 
(Former Oklahoma coach) Barry Switzer said he always came down early and felt 
like it was the ideal way to prepare his squad. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Switzer is the guy I want to listen to." 
</P>
<P>
McCartney said the Buffaloes came to Miami early because cold weather and snow 
in Colorado made it difficult for them to practice at home. 
</P>
<P>
The players seem to be enjoying the change in climate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance for us to come down here and get used to the weather," wide 
receiver Jeff Campbell said. "We're coming from a place where there isn't any 
oxygen to a place where there's a lot of oxygen. So we have to get used to 
stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
Said quarterback Darian Hagan, a Los Angeles native: "This is good weather to 
practice in. We're living it up right now." 
</P>
<P>
Said McCartney: "I'm not in any way concerned about being down here too long." 
</P>
<P>
Your move, Lou. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What is the name of the only bowl game ever played in Havana, and 
which teams participated? (Answer below.) 
</P>
<P>
Monday's Rose Bowl game will be played on the 50th anniversary of the 1940 game 
between USC and Tennessee. The game was unique in that it marked the second 
consecutive year that USC defeated Rose Bowl opponents who came into the game 
unbeaten, untied and unscored upon. 
</P>
<P>
USC beat Duke, 7-3, in the 1939 game on Doyle Nave's last-minute touchdown pass 
to Al Krueger. 
</P>
<P>
The Trojans then spoiled Tennessee's perfect record, 14-0, behind the running 
and passing of tailback Ambrose Schindler. 
</P>
<P>
USC's victory prompted Henry McLemore of United Press to write: 
</P>
<P>
"They raise them rugged out here. Perhaps nature sees that they do in order 
that they will be able to withstand earthquakes, unusual weather and the water 
that comes out of the taps. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lesson to be learned from the Rose Bowl game. There is no sense in 
betting on a team that buys its clothes in the boys' department to beat a team 
that has to shave twice a day and is fitted for suits in the adult or grown-up 
section." 
</P>
<P>
It was the last Rose Bowl game for USC Coach Howard Jones. He died in 1941, 
leaving a legacy of five Rose bowl victories without a defeat. 
</P>
<P>
If Miami wins the national championship, Dennis Erickson will become the first 
coach in 41 years to get the title in his first year at a school. Michigan's 
Bennie Oosterbaan was the last coach to do it, in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Bacardi Bowl on Jan. 1, 1937, when Auburn and Villanova 
played to a 7-7 tie.

ROSE BOWL NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
IF USC CAN'T TRIPP HIM, IT MUST FIND A WAY TO STOP WELBORNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sullivan Anthony Welborne III, better known as Tripp, for triple, is one of the 
nation's premier defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, the Michigan strong safety insists that basketball is his first love. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the ever-smiling, personable Welborne likes to tell the story about 
being recruited by Bo Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
The Michigan coach watched Welborne play for his high school basketball team in 
Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart belongs to Michigan, but basketball is my favorite sport. I used to 
shoot a lot. No shot is a bad shot. If you're off, you got to shoot until 
you're on. If you're on, you got to keep shooting because you're on," Welborne 
reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
After a non-stop shooting spree, Welborne recalled that Schembechler told him 
he'd have to ice his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'I always shoot like that.' He said, 'You shot it every time.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now, Welborne, a junior All-American, is shooting down quarterbacks as 
Michigan's designated blitzer. 
</P>
<P>
In this year's 22-14 Rose Bowl victory over USC he made 10 tackles, intercepted 
a pass and forced a fumble. 
</P>
<P>
He was also prominent in his team's come-from-behind, 24-23 win over UCLA 
earlier this season with a 63-yard punt return. 
</P>
<P>
That was the turning-point game for Michigan, Welborne said, after a 
season-opening loss to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
"We showed our character, showed we could come back, and I think UCLA played 
the best game it played all year," Welborne said. "We didn't play our best 
game, but to come out with a win showed that we hung together. We never thought 
we were going to lose. It showed we can come back from adversity. The lesson 
is, never quit." 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl game will showcase two of the nation's best defensive backs -- 
Welborne and USC's Mark Carrier, a finalist for the Jim Thorpe award. 
</P>
<P>
Welborne and Carrier were roommates in a hotel during the taping of the Bob 
Hope television show, featuring 1989 All-American players. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about everything," Welborne said. "We talked about the practices we 
had. Our practices are so similar. He told us what they did, and I said, 
'That's the same thing we do.' So it's going to be a battle of the titans, 
everything is equal. The team with the fewest mistakes will win." 
</P>
<P>
As for Carrier, Welborne said: "I've seen him on film, and he's a great, great 
player who makes big plays when you need them." 
</P>
<P>
Welborne has also been impressed by USC quarterback Todd Marinovich. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that he can't play the game because he's young. He can throw the ball 
and do the things necessary to win. He has proved it during the season. 
</P>
<P>
"So we have to go out and play as if he's a veteran, and in our minds, he is. 
He is one of the toughest quarterbacks I've seen outside of our own (Michael 
Taylor). He throws passes and gets hit in the chest, and he'll get right back 
up. That's the mark of a true competitor." 
</P>
<P>
"But, hopefully, he'll make some mistakes in the game and give us a break." 
</P>
<P>
The ongoing theme of the 76th Rose Bowl game is Schembechler's retirement. He 
said he's enjoying his last week of coaching and will be more cognizant of his 
health when he retires 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler had a heart attack before the 1970 Rose Bowl game with USC and has 
had two bypass operations. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not into my new life yet," he said. "But as soon as this is over I'm going 
to the treadmill, watch what I eat and lose weight. I figure this is my last 
fling." 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler has been accommodating and seemingly relaxed during news 
conferences at his team's hotel in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't even get irritated when someone suggested that there would be a hole 
in his career if he doesn't win a national championship. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a hole in my career, as far as I'm concerned," he said. "It may be 
for other people. There's nothing I would have done any differently in my 
coaching career. I won some games, won some (Big Ten) championships, made a lot 
of friends, what the hell else do you want?" 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler also discounts the emotional factor of his team trying to win one 
final game for their coach. "We don't need that. We're playing in the Rose 
Bowl. We don't need any added incentive." 
</P>
<P>
Fritz Crisler was the last Michigan lame-duck coach to bring a team to the Rose 
Bowl. The Wolverines responded, beating USC, 49-0, in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith is in favor of sudden-death overtime in college football 
games as a tiebreaking procedure. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't believe that teams should battle for 60 minutes just to end up in a 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that season-ending 10-10 tie with UCLA is still frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
USC defensive tackle Dan Owens has started every game in his four years at the 
school, and the Rose Bowl will be his 48th in a row. . . . Marinovich, who was 
named freshman of the year by UPI and the Sporting News, is already seventh on 
USC's career passing list.

NEWSWIRE: COMANECI SAYS SHE WAS TARGET OF CEAUSESCU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Olympic gymnast Nadia Comaneci said her defection just weeks before 
Romania's Communist government crumbled had so embarrassed leader Nicolae 
Ceausescu that he ordered her hunted down and brought back. 
</P>
<P>
Comaneci, 28, who surprised the world when she fled Romania, said she hopes to 
visit her homeland after its crisis ends. Ceausescu, the last of the ironclad 
Stalinist leaders in the Warsaw Pact countries, was executed with his wife 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Comments from Comaneci were included in a release issued in New York announcing 
that David Frost's company, David Paradine Television Inc., would produce the 
film of her story. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that through the movie and public statements I can be of more help to 
my countrymen than by returning to live in Bucharest," Comaneci's statement 
said.

NUNN REPORTEDLY WANTS BETTER CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Middleweight champion Michael Nunn, now of Agoura Hills, is said to be unhappy 
with manager Dan Goossen, trainer Joe Goossen and the rest of the Reseda 
management firm, Ten Goose Boxing. Dan Goossen, whose management contract with 
Nunn expires in November, denies there is a problem. But Nunn's longtime 
adviser, Bob Surkein, of Ft. Myers, Fla., confirmed that Nunn has become 
unhappy with the percentages in his Ten Goose contract. 
</P>
<P>
Boxing sources in Las Vegas and Davenport, Iowa, Nunn's hometown, also 
indicated Nunn's heretofore happy relationship with the Goossens has turned 
sour and that he wants a new contract or he wants out. 
</P>
<P>
The same sources also question the validity of Nunn's "wrenched back" he is 
said to have suffered on his staircase at home. That injury, and not a 
Nunn-Goossen dispute, Goossen said, forced the cancellation of the Jan. 27 bout 
against Marlon Starling at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no problems with Michael that I know of," Goossen said. "All we're 
concerned about now is getting Michael healthy and back into training." 
</P>
<P>
Surkein, a longtime amateur boxing official who sponsored Nunn's amateur career 
and still advises him, said Friday that Nunn wants a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael tells me he will honor his present contract with the Goossens, but 
that if he re-signs with them in November, the percentages must change," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"And frankly, I think Michael's not entirely happy living in Southern 
California. He grew up in Davenport in a very tight-knit family, and he misses 
that. Basically, this is a guy who went from nothing to a million-dollar 
fighter, and even though he may be 26, he's still growing into his situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Under this contract, the percentages are two-thirds for Michael, one-third for 
the Goossens. If Michael signs a new deal with them, it'll be 70-30, and the 
Goossens will pay for all the training expenses and for Joe Goossen's share. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be said that for the first two years of Michael's career, the 
Goossens didn't take a nickel. It was an investment for them for a long time 
with no return. 
</P>
<P>
"The Goossens have done a good job with Mike. They took a kid who didn't make 
the '84 Olympic team and turned him into a million dollar fighter." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach Nunn Thursday and Friday through Goossen were unsuccessful. 
"His line's busy," Goossen said. 
</P>
<P>
Ron May, a lawyer in Davenport and longtime friend of Nunn's, said Nunn has 
spoken with him lately about his relationship with Ten Goose. 
</P>
<P>
"I won't tell you exactly what Michael and I have discussed, because that would 
be breaking a confidentiality," he said. "But I can tell you that the subject 
was his contract with them (Ten Goose)." 
</P>
<P>
Goossen had signed an agreement with the Mirage Hotel whereby Nunn would fight 
three times at the hotel. Nunn is supposed to have been paid $500,000 up front 
for the deal. But the pact is reportedly up in the air now. 
</P>
<P>
Also airborne is Starling, who was to receive $800,000 for fighting Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
"We're aggrieved," said Starling adviser Morton Sharnik. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no reason to believe Nunn's injury isn't legitimate, but we feel we're 
owed at least an explanation (from Ten Goose). Marlon put his career on hold 
for this fight. He's a welterweight and had put on weight. He's also out 
$15,000 out-of-pocket expenses for training." 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, the International Boxing Federation middleweight champion, has been 
managed by Ten Goose since he turned pro in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
With Dan Goossen managing his career and his brother, Joe, training him, Nunn 
has won 33 consecutive professional fights, including a technical knockout of 
Frank Tate in July, 1988. That win gave him the IBF title, which he has 
defended successfully three times. 
</P>
<P>
"Uno Mas," or Leonard-Duran III, may have been a dull fight, but it does go 
into the trivia book on one count: It became the first high-definition-TV 
telecast of a sports event in America. 
</P>
<P>
The HDTV version of the fight was shown at five closed-circuit locations in 
North America, but visitors to Leonard's and Duran's Las Vegas workouts could 
watch the fighters on HDTV monitors. The image was sharp enough to see each 
drop of sweat fly off the boxers and strike the canvas. One other thing is 
clear: Everyone did well on Uno Mas except the pay-per-viewers. The fighters, 
promoter, Mirage and pay-per-view promoters all made a lot of money. In 
Southern California, the fight was purchased by 120,000 households. Boxing 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Don King, Mike Tyson's promoter, appeared at George Foreman's training camp in 
Marshall, Tex., two weeks ago armed with contracts for a Foreman-Tyson fight, 
providing that Foreman beats Gerry Cooney on Jan. 15. "George was polite, but 
he told King that he wouldn't consider or sign anything until after the Cooney 
fight," said Foreman adviser Morton Sharnik. King was talking about "$3 million 
to $5 million" for a Tyson fight, he added.

Seven boxers from the Soviet Union have arrived in Toronto and begun training 
for pro boxing careers in Canada and the United States. They are being trained 
by Boris Gitman, who emigrated from the Soviet Union, and will be promoted by 
Lou Falcigno of New York. 
</P>
<P>
Featherweight champion Jorge Paez, the Forum, the Las Vegas Hilton and NBC have 
entered into a boxing agreement, under which the colorful Paez would defend his 
International Boxing Federation title up to four times in 1990, starting with 
Troy Dorsey on Feb. 4. The Hilton will play host to the fights, and NBC will 
televise them. NBC's Aug. 6 telecast of the Paez-Steve Cruz bout was the 
highest-rated network boxing show of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The California Athletic Commission won't decide on heavyweight Tony Tubbs' fate 
until its Jan. 19 meeting in San Diego. Tubbs, who tested positive for and 
admitted to cocaine use after his November decision over Orlin Norris, didn't 
show up for the Dec. 15 commission meeting, and the commissioners, acting on 
advice of counsel, postponed a ruling.

DANA POINT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shivering in the dark boxcar, chilled by ocean winds, the Latino men crouch as 
the freight train slows around a bend. 
</P>
<P>
When the train decelerates to 20 m.p.h., the men jump, hitting loose rock and 
gravel with a crunch, and roll to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the tracks, lights beckon from a tract of upscale Dana 
Point homes. The men stand up, dust themselves off and slip into the underbrush 
to find shelter for the night. 
</P>
<P>
For illegal immigrants without family or friends in Orange County, the tangled 
underbrush of Dana Point and San Juan Capistrano becomes a home for what local 
social workers and law enforcement officials are calling the largest pocket of 
homeless people in South County. 
</P>
<P>
They sleep in tents, cardboard boxes or sometimes hollow out the middle of a 
large bush wherever there is undeveloped land. The winter mornings chill their 
bones, and meals are sporadic at best when money runs low. 
</P>
<P>
To ease the boredom between jobs, the pain of separation from families and the 
alienation of life in a strange country, some find solace in alcohol, while 
others take comfort in religion. 
</P>
<P>
Benito Cano Solis smiles broadly as he welcomes newcomers to his home for the 
past six months, a battered cardboard refrigerator box that is hidden by dense 
underbrush growing on the dusty riverbed of San Juan Creek. 
</P>
<P>
In the evening gloom, his candle shines brightly as the young illegal alien 
puts down a battered, brown Bible. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a normal life," Solis says, speaking softly. "But I have faith, 
and I will work hard. What more do you need?" 
</P>
<P>
But with cities all over Orange County cracking down on dayworkers and their 
employers, opportunities to work have been scarce. Solis has not found 
employment for four days. From the tenuous grapevine that connects the 
illegal-migrant underground in Southern California, Solis has heard that there 
are jobs "somewhere in the north. I will probably go soon." 
</P>
<P>
Church and law enforcement officials say Solis is typical of the homeless 
Latino illegal alien -- a teen- to middle-age man who has left family and 
friends to find a better life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Alone, often desperate to send money back home, they migrate throughout 
California in search of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
For many transients, the freight trains are a taxi service that leaves hourly 
from the train yards of San Diego and travels north through Orange County to 
Corona, say Santa Fe Railway officials. 
</P>
<P>
"At any time of the day you can count 100 or more of them" hitching a ride in 
boxcars, said Jim Cassady, whose San Juan Capistrano plant nursery borders the 
railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how many jump off at the Capistrano Beach section of Dana Point is 
unknown, although a local church volunteer estimated that at least two dozen 
people are currently living in the hills and bushes by the railroad tracks, 
setting up makeshift camps on both sides of the Dana Point-San Juan Capistrano 
border. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County sheriff's deputies say the homeless Latino population there 
swells during the warm summer months. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it gets up to between 50 and 60 people that are visible," said Lt. 
Dan Martini, a Sheriff's Department spokesman. "I'd say it is the biggest group 
of homeless in South County." 
</P>
<P>
But now it is winter, and at night the Pacific winds bite deeply. 
</P>
<P>
Like a bear emerging from a winter cave, Luis Rivera shoves his head out of a 
pup tent and groans. 
</P>
<P>
"Ay, it is cold," he said, but with heavy breezes bending the dry scrub brush 
surrounding the camp. "It is too dangerous to make fire." 
</P>
<P>
The small tent starts to shake as two teen-agers from Guatemala, who have 
shared the tent with Rivera for five months, struggle to leave the shelter. "I 
think it is a snake," he jokes. 
</P>
<P>
A row of shoes and boots line the outside of the tent. Covered with dirt, 
Rivera's sneakers stand out because he is the only one who found work that day. 
Pulling out his wallet, he displays some of the $45 he earned carrying cement 
bags at a construction site "in Mission Viejo, I think," Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
As it was the first money he has made in a week, $10 went immediately to buy 
dinner for the three men. Crumpled Burger King bags by the tent are all that 
remains of the evening meal. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining cash will last three days, said Rivera, until Wednesday, when 
they will eat at a soup kitchen run by Calvary Church in Dana Point. Thursday 
will take care of itself. 
</P>
<P>
Lydia Martinez, a Calvary Church administrator, said she is constantly amazed 
by the courage of illegal aliens such as Solis and Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
"These are men with families far away who are willing to take whatever risk 
there is to feed their children and clothe them," said Martinez. "I have total 
admiration for them." 
</P>
<P>
"When you see them walk into the church, they have a sense of pride and a sense 
of cleanliness," she said. "But sometimes they are embarrassed when they come 
to eat when they are not clean." 
</P>
<P>
"Other times they sit and they'll cry because they cannot bring their 
families," Martinez said. "They see the life style of the rich in Dana Point, 
but they can't touch it. It makes me want to cry." 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, Miguel Castro has a room with a view. It is a hazy morning, 
but from Castro's lean-to -- a sheet of ply board reclining against a large 
bush with a slab of dirty foam rubber serving as bedding -- hundreds of 
expensive homes can be seen dotting the surrounding hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not think much about them," said Castro, 29, who came to Dana Point from 
Mexico two months ago. "Why? I cannot even buy an apartment." 
</P>
<P>
Castro said he feels pressure to send money to his wife and four children, who 
are living with relatives near Mexico City. Last week he sent them $50, which 
he said will feed his family for a month. 
</P>
<P>
He keeps a picture of them in a plastic bag in back of his lean-to. The photo, 
filled with smiling children, is dog-eared from loving handling. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Castro's day starts at sunrise with a mile-long walk 
along the tracks to Capistrano Beach, where he will take a sponge bath from a 
cold water tap. By 8 a.m. he is ready to join several other Latinos looking for 
employment along Doheny Park Road in defiance of a 2-month-old Dana Point 
ordinance that bans solicitation of dayworkers on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 200 Latinos crowded a block-long section of Doheny Park before sheriff's 
deputies stationed in Dana Point began enforcing the city law. Now, only about 
20 to 30 dayworkers remain. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't give us any trouble," said Sheriff's Deputy Dan Salcedo. "They just 
shrug their shoulders and move on. I don't know where they go." 
</P>
<P>
At 10 a.m., Castro gives up the wait and walks to a nearby doughnut shop. The 
rest of the day will be spent talking with friends in front of Capistrano Beach 
stores. At night they pool their resources to buy beer and drink it outside on 
a stack of abandoned wooden pallets. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing more to do," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Poverty and boredom aside, Castro and other illegal aliens say their greatest 
fear is being caught and deported by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
Walking to the beach along the tracks, Solis' eyes are constantly scanning the 
terrain ahead. "The immigration," he explains. "I have been sent back two times 
already." 
</P>
<P>
INS border patrol spokesman Ted Swofford said agents are aware of the 
Capistrano Beach bush dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
"We make daytime patrols of the day laborers," he said. But "as far as going 
out of our way to raid their sleeping areas, that's not something we are used 
to doing." 
</P>
<P>
The INS does make constant checks of the trains running between San Diego and 
Orange County, Swofford said, adding that Dana Point has long been a drop-off 
point for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and law enforcement officers in both Dana Point and San Juan 
Capistrano say transients have camped out near the railroad tracks for at least 
15 years, or longer. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, travelers have stopped over in San Juan Capistrano on their way 
north for centuries," said San Juan Capistrano City Manager Stephen B. Julien. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years ago, Christian Pederson found out what it was like to be 
homeless in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
The San Clemente auto mechanic was living in his native Peru when a friend 
described the opportunities in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me about the nice houses and the cars and I said, 'Why not go?' " 
Pederson recalled. 
</P>
<P>
After a hazardous trip that was marred by several run-ins with police in South 
America and Mexico, Pederson arrived in South County. His first home was a 
deserted fisherman's shack in Dana Point Harbor where he stayed for several 
weeks until enough money could be saved for an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he owns his own auto road service and volunteers at Calvary Church. In 
training to become a pastor, Pederson conducts worship services where he finds 
illegal immigrants willing to listen. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hurt, I was miserable and God gave me life," he said. "So when I see 
people who are hurting, I have to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
On one recent morning, Pederson gathered four illegal aliens, including Solis, 
outside an art supply store in Capistrano Beach for an impromptu fellowship 
service. 
</P>
<P>
As cold winds blew small scraps of paper around the tiny congregation, the men 
stood in a circle with their heads bowed while Pederson recited prayers in 
Spanish on the concrete sidewalks outside the store. 
</P>
<P>
"They seem so eager," Pederson said. "They have a vision of prosperity for the 
future. I try to teach them hope."

INVASION BY MEDFLY DEFIES LOGIC, SCIENTISTS SAY; 
</P>
<P>
INFESTATION: EXPERTS DISCOVER PECULIAR PATTERNS IN THE SPREAD OF THE STUBBORN 
FRUIT FLY. SOME SUSPECT SABOTAGE BY BIOLOGICAL TERRORISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
As the battle against the Mediterranean fruit fly enters a new year and aerial 
pesticide spraying covers still more neighborhoods in Orange and Los Angeles 
counties, state and federal officials remain baffled by several aspects of a 
stubborn infestation. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some peculiar things happening," said Caroll Calkins, a researcher 
in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Insect Behavior Unit in Gainesville, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, some of the scientists are puzzled by the small number of Medfly 
larvae that have turned up. It is in this insect stage that the Medfly does its 
greatest damage to fruit and vegetables. The scientists believe an infestation 
this size should produce more evidence of larvae. 
</P>
<P>
Others wonder why 23 out of 30 fertile flies trapped on the infestation's 
frontier during the last month have been females, and have been found in only 
one of the three kinds of Medfly traps. Agriculture officials said they cannot 
explain why more males aren't being trapped. 
</P>
<P>
And in a final riddle, many of the Medflies have been trapped just outside 
previous spray zones, forcing steady expansion of the area undergoing malathion 
treatments. Some experts said the pattern is as illogical as it is frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Los Angeles on Dec. 6, the scientific panel questioned whether 
the unexplained patterns of infestation might lend credence to a letter 
distributed by a group that calls itself the Breeders. In the letter, sent to 
newspapers and Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, the group claimed to be spreading 
Medflies to protest California agricultural practices. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Cunningham, a Department of Agriculture Medfly expert and chairman of the 
panel, said Friday that the panel is taking this possibility seriously but 
still feels there is no proof: "We don't see any hard evidence (that the letter 
writer) has the wherewithal to do what he has threatened." 
</P>
<P>
The Breeders letter was turned over to the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Criminal Conspiracy Section. Department spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said 
investigators have "made some progress." 
</P>
<P>
At the advisory panel meeting, according to one member who was present, one 
adviser suggested that the finding of females in just one type of trap, known 
as a McPhail trap, could be evidence of sabotage. In interviews, scientists 
have also said the small numbers of larvae, which indicate a natural breeding 
population of Medflies, and the nagging pattern of new flies emerging just 
outside spray zones could fuel suspicions that the flies are being spread by 
the Breeders. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, other, more benign scenarios are being circulated in an 
attempt to explain the infestation's quirks. For instance, James Carey, a 
member of the science panel, said the small number of larvae detected does not 
necessarily mean that the fly is being spread unnaturally, rather than by 
breeding and moving. 
</P>
<P>
It is his opinion that the Los Angeles infestation could date back several 
years and that the bug has become established in the region. He is a minority 
voice on the panel on that point. 
</P>
<P>
Calkins said the lack of larvae could show that the infestation was small and 
isolated, and located away from traps. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe the current infestation began in Whittier, where a Medfly 
was first trapped on Sept. 26. They believe this because larvae were detected 
there, indicating the existence of a breeding population. 
</P>
<P>
As the infestation spread across the Los Angeles Basin to parts of Brea, La 
Habra and Fullerton in Orange County, however, scientists did not find nearly 
as many larvae. 
</P>
<P>
The life cycle of a Medfly begins with the laying of eggs in a piece of fruit 
or a vegetable. When the eggs hatch several days later, the larvae feed on the 
fruit, turning it into an inedible mush. The bugs drop to the ground and 
continue developing in a pupal stage, and the adult flies emerge later. 
</P>
<P>
Three types of traps are being used to lure Medflies -- the Jackson, Steiner 
and McPhail traps. Almost all of the flies are females, and are showing up in 
the McPhail traps. It would be expected that males would be caught in the 
Jackson trap, which contains a sex lure that has proven effective in past 
Medfly invasions.

CHEF TO CARVE ICY CENTERPIECE FOR HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLISON SAMUELS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For hotel chef Shuichi Konno, ringing in the New Year in Southern California 
will mean laboring for hours carving a 340-pound chunk of ice. 
</P>
<P>
The result -- the number 90 surrounded by an array of delicately-carved birds, 
flowers and palm trees -- will form the centerpiece of celebrations at the 
Irvine Marriott hotel, where the 40-year-old Konno works. 
</P>
<P>
Konno, 40, said he moved with his family from Japan, where he was also a chef, 
to the United States in 1978 because "this country offers more options to 
prepare and satisfy a variety of foods and tastes." 
</P>
<P>
Once here, the award-winning chef said he became fascinated with the art of ice 
carving, and learned it from a friend in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Konno also prepares his creations for birthday parties and weddings. A kissing 
couple or a pair of icy cold hearts are designed for wedding receptions, while 
the age of the person usually adorns a food table for birthday parties. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Konno will return to Japan to compete in the World Championship 
Ice Carving Competition. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have 48 hours to carve 20 blocks of 300-pound ice," Konno said. 
"Whoever creates the most spectacular design in that amount of time wins." 
Although Konno isn't disclosing exactly what his creation for the competition 
will be, he admits he has a preference for the Chinese firebird. 
</P>
<P>
"You can do a lot with ice, so I try to not limit myself," Konno said. "But the 
Chinese firebird is such a proud bird, I most enjoy working on it no matter how 
many times I create one." ALLISON SAMUELS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
APPROVAL PREDICTED FOR WETLANDS PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A top Army official who toured the Bolsa Chica Wetlands this week predicted a 
quick and smooth review of a long-debated plan for restoration and partial 
development of the sensitive coastal area. 
</P>
<P>
The tour of the unincorporated Orange County land near Huntington Beach, 
conducted by Col. Charles Thomas, the Army Corps of Engineers' Los Angeles 
district commander, officially began the complicated review procedure. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, this is a controversial process, mainly because you have a 
developer that wants to build out the entire property versus conservationists 
who don't want any of it developed," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I've seen anyone pull together a coalition involving 
(the conflicting interests) that came up with a proposal that makes everybody 
happy," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas' comments suggest that, after 15 years of political maneuvering and 
bickering over the fate of the 1,635-acre strip of marshland along Pacific 
Coast Highway south of Warner Avenue, the planned restoration, which could get 
under way as soon as January of 1991, is progressing. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which calls for up to 1,105 acres of wetlands to be restored and 
limits residential development to 412 acres, was approved in May by a coalition 
representing environmentalists, government and the developer, Signal Landmark. 
</P>
<P>
A group representing those interests will organize in a ceremony Tuesday at the 
wetlands. It will serve as a vehicle for community involvement in the project 
and monitor its progress. 
</P>
<P>
That group, the Bolsa Chica Conservancy, will be directed by a board made up of 
Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, Amigos de Bolsa Chica President 
and environmentalist Shirley Dettloff, Signal Landmark President Peter 
Denniston, state Lands Commissioner Dan Gorfain and Huntington Beach City 
Councilman Peter M. Green. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, scheduled for 2 p.m. at a Sea Point Street site overlooking the 
Bolsa Chica lowlands, is also scheduled to feature the appointment of Victor 
Liepzig, a Huntington Beach biologist and former Amigos de Bolsa Chica 
president, as the conservancy's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
Before work can begin on the project, approval must be granted by state and 
federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said it is too early to discuss particular issues that the corps will 
consider, but he lauded the efforts of the various entities that worked to 
forge the development compromise. JOHN PENNER

CUSTOMERS ASKED FOR CLUES IN ARSON FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Fire Department, seeking more leads in a $2-million arson, is trying to 
find customers who were in the Thrifty Drug Store at Katella Avenue and Euclid 
Street shortly before it burned to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
A fire erupted in the store about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, and raged for more than 
three hours before being brought under control about 1 a.m. Wednesday. The 
store was destroyed and four adjoining small stores were damaged by smoke and 
water. Total property loss was estimated at from $1.5 million to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials announced Wednesday that the blaze had been deliberately set in 
a paper-goods area of the store. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Capt. Bill Dumas, an arson investigator for the department, said Friday 
that some employees and customers who were in the store already have provided a 
few clues to a possible suspect in the arson. But Dumas said more information 
is needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking the news media if they can help us locate a few more customers 
who were in the store," Dumas said. "We hope to locate people who were in the 
store between 8:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. Tuesday night. We're asking them to call 
the Fire Department." 
</P>
<P>
Persons who were in the store during that time are asked to call either Dumas 
at (714) 741-5626 or the battalion chief at (714) 741-5680. 
</P>
<P>
Dumas said the department hopes to obtain enough information to release a 
composite description of the suspect next week. BILL BILLITEER

POLICE TO TARGET DRUNK DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For New Year's Eve, city police plan to do more of what they do often -- arrest 
drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen officers and the police helicopter will be devoted entirely to pulling 
over holiday drunks. The city's Driving Under the Influence Task Force will 
operate from 7:30 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. with two-man teams of officers patrolling 
the streets and the copter watching from above for suspiciously weaving 
motorists. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, the city has a single two-man team of officers patrolling for drunk 
drivers. Over the past two years, the teams have logged more than 1,400 drunk 
driving arrests and won recognition from Mothers Against Drunk Driving, 
according to Sgt. Tom Winter. 
</P>
<P>
For revelers who have had one drink too many on New Year's Eve, Yellow Cab of 
North Orange County and Orange Coast Yellow Cab will be offering free rides 
home under a program sponsored by local beer and wine wholesalers, he said.

<P>
SECOND TROLLEY MIGHT BE ADDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE ESPY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's free, looks and sounds like a cable car and has drawn rave reviews since 
it appeared in Placentia two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
The city's new red-and-green trolley offers free rides on a 17-mile circuit 
through town with 31 stops, including most major Placentia shopping centers, 
the library, civic center, community buildings and schools and parks. 
</P>
<P>
The trolley made its debut during the annual Heritage Days Festival last 
October, and city officials say the response has been so great that a second 
trolley is being considered. 
</P>
<P>
"It's doing much better than expected, " Mayor Norman Z. Eckenrode said. He 
said an average of 40 people per day use the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"Seniors are elated," said Geoffrey Cabbett, Placentia's maintenance services 
supervisor. "The trolley stops at mobile home parks where some seniors are shut 
in, so they're delighted to have transportation all over at no cost. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people ride not to go somewhere, but to tour the city or for a novelty. 
But then they realize that they can leave the car at home and go to the store 
on the trolley, so they start using it." 
</P>
<P>
The only complaint has been absence of a timetable. The trolley takes a little 
over an hour to complete its circuit, with no set time scheduled for arrivals 
and departures beyond the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. start and finish times. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people expect more out of it than it is," Cabbett said. "Everyone has 
been very supportive, and I think people realize a little inconvenience is 
worth the price. However, as successful as this is, we'll probably need another 
trolley in the future to provide for additional ridership and a closer network 
of time." 
</P>
<P>
"We definitely need to have two trolleys," driver Andres Fenner said. "The main 
drawback is that people going one way have to ride clear around the city to get 
back home." 
</P>
<P>
Fenner, who has driven dial-a-ride vehicles and other community transport 
services, said that most trolley riders are not regular mass-transit users. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they see how easy it is, they may become transit users," he said. "Or 
they may use the trolley to get to one place and then take the bus or dial-a 
ride home after hours." 
</P>
<P>
it." 
</P>
<P>
On one recent circuit, as the trolley neared the library and civic center, it 
filled up quickly with both children and adults. A family of seven arrived, 
headed for Tri-City Park with fresh popcorn to feed the ducks. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't plan on taking the trolley," explained another rider, Judy Bush. "But 
when my son ran over and climbed aboard, I figured, 'OK.' 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to know that I can get a ride home. I don't even have my wallet," 
added Bush, with her 7-month-old daughter, Jacqueline, on her lap and son Paul, 
2, by her side. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still figuring out where the trolley fits in," Fenner said. "It's not 
really mass transit, and it's more than just a novelty, but it definitely fills 
a need." JULIE ESPY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 
</P>
<P>
18% OF STUDENTS LACK FLUENCY IN ENGLISH 
</P>

<P>
More than 18% of Orange County's public school students are not fluent in 
English, almost double the number six years ago, according to a statewide 
end-of-the-decade report on language proficiency released Friday by the state 
Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County numbers closely reflect statewide figures that show an 
explosive growth in the number of limited-English-speaking students in grades 
kindergarten through 12, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
"The influx of students from non-English-speaking backgrounds is a big 
challenge for our schools," state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said 
in a statement Friday. "It comes at a time when California's schools are 
already the most crowded in the nation, and when we are demanding higher levels 
of performance from our educators and our students." 
</P>
<P>
James Fulton of the state Education Department's demographics unit said the 
number of limited-English students in Orange County soared from 33,133 in 1982 
to 64,544 in 1989. Total student enrollment in Orange County grew by only 2% 
during the same period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a percentage of the total school enrollment, the limited-English student 
population rose from 9.6% in 1982 to 18.4% in 1989, Fulton said. 
</P>
<P>
The report also found that another 47,000 Orange County students who speak a 
foreign language at home are fluent in English. But Fulton noted that most of 
those students are in the upper grades. 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at kindergarten through six, for example, roughly seven in 10 
students are LEP (limited-English-proficiency) kids," Fulton said. "When we 
look at FEPs (fluent-English proficiency), we find that it's about 51% in 
grades seven through 12." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the LEP students in all grades statewide speak Spanish, according to 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, 47,577 of the 64,544 LEP students, or about 73.7%, speak 
Spanish; 7,182, or 11.1%, speak Vietnamese; and 1,772 students, or 2.7%, speak 
Korean. Of the nine other major languages in county schools -- Cantonese, 
Cambodian, Filipino, Hmong, Lao, Mandarin, Armenian, Japanese and Farsi -- 
there are less than 1,000 LEP students in each. TONY MARCANO

NEW NEGOTIATIONS SET ON LAGUNA LAUREL PLAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Irvine Co. has frozen its controversial plans to build 3,200 homes in 
pristine Laguna Canyon pending a round of intense negotiations with the city of 
Laguna Beach, which opposes the Laguna Laurel development. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to try to see if there's any adjustment or any modification we can 
live with that would change their attitude toward the project," Irvine Co. Vice 
President Larry Thomas said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual bargaining session is expected to take place in early January, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have fought development in the serene canyon for a decade. 
Opposition has intensified of late, culminating in a protest march Nov. 11 that 
drew about 7,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Two recent proposals to end the battle over the canyon have failed. In 
November, the Laguna Beach City Council spurned an offer by the Irvine Co. to 
sell 276 acres, about one-tenth of the canyon, for $38 million. On Dec. 13, 
Irvine officials flatly rejected the idea of moving the project to their city, 
with Mayor Larry Agran comparing the development to "a garbage barge in search 
of a port." 
</P>
<P>
Now, both the Irvine Co. and Laguna Beach have asked the county to postpone a 
Planning Commission hearing scheduled for Jan. 16 to consider the project's 
environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a routine thing," said City Councilman Robert F. Gentry, who is 
heading the negotiating team. "It indicates that our negotiations are serious, 
professional and productive. Otherwise, both sides would not have been willing 
to ask the Planning Commission to delay the hearing." 
</P>
<P>
The issues, Gentry said, "are, frankly, the whole future of Laguna Canyon: how 
the Irvine Company can turn a profit on that land, and how the cities . . . can 
have their environmental needs met at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably one of the most serious and important land-use and public-policy 
decisions to be made in Orange County over the decade," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Topics might include purchasing the land, moving all or part of the project, or 
compromising on its scale, Gentry said. He said he would like to add to the 
bargaining table representatives of the county and perhaps representatives of 
other cities whose residents have a stake in the fate of the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never sat down and talked until 1989," Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said the Irvine Co. is confident that its plan to protect the canyon 
from environmental damage is sound and will pass muster despite the opposition. 
He said the decision to delay indefinitely is an attempt to reach an elusive 
community consensus. But, Thomas said, the responsibility for making the next 
proposal rests with Laguna Beach officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to listen to them and see if there is common ground. . . ," Thomas 
said. "But I would look to them for the initiative."

MATER DEI MAKES QUICK WORK OF SADDLEBACK IN 62-40 VICTORY

<P>
It only took two seconds, or as quick as one can say Mater Dei High School, to 
establish which is the best prep basketball team in Orange County this season. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei, the team of the '80s, capped a remarkable decade by defeating 
Saddleback, 62-40, Friday night in the championship game of the 25th Orange 
Holiday Tournament in Chapman College's Hutton Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei (12-1) won the game with two remarkable plays that took all of two 
seconds in the third quarter. Saddleback (10-5) never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Andres provided a stirring three-point play with three seconds 
remaining in the quarter that pushed Mater Dei ahead, 42-32. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback turned the ball over on the ensuing inbound play, and Mater Dei got 
possession with three seconds still showing on the clock. The Monarchs worked 
the ball into guard Danny O'Neil, who scored on a reverse layup and was fouled. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil completed the three-point play and suddenly Mater Dei had a 13-point 
lead. O'Neil, who finished with 21 points, had 11 points in the third quarter 
but didn't make the all-tournament team. Teammate Andy Karich was named the 
most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a triangle that we use on out-of-bounds plays and Danny did a little 
ad-libbing," said Gary McKnight, Mater Dei coach. "Saddleback had probably seen 
it two or three times, so Danny did some adjusting. It really helped." 
</P>
<P>
The tournament championship was the sixth for Mater Dei since 1982 and avenged 
last year's loss to Saddleback in the title game. But it didn't come without 
controversy, which has also been a trademark for Mater Dei in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight caused most of the excitement in the first half, getting two technical 
fouls for disputing calls in a very physical game. McKnight got his first 
technical when officials disallowed Derek Stone's basket with 4:51 remaining in 
the first quarter, ruling that a foul occurred before Stone's basket. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight's second technical came with 1:48 remaining in the second quarter when 
the officials ruled that two seconds be put back on the clock. The second 
technical helped Saddleback get back into the game after trailing by as many as 
13 points in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei's aggressive defensive play forced 10 turnovers but was also 
responsible for the early foul trouble that Stone and point guard Jason Quinn 
got into. Both had three fouls in the half but didn't foul out. 
</P>
<P>
In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez 56, Marina 44 -- Dominguez outscored Marina, 23-8, in the second 
quarter to take a 19-point lead and Marina (8-6) made only two of seven shots 
in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez (11-1) did a good job of containing Marina's 6-foot-11 center, 
Cherokee Parks, for most of the game. Parks scored 24 points, had nine rebounds 
and blocked five shots but tired in the fourth quarter when he failed to make a 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
In the fifth-place game: 
</P>
<P>
El Toro 71, Foothill 60 -- Rob Johnson made a pair of three-point shots and 
scored on a layup off a steal to open the second half as El Toro (11-2) erased 
a six-point halftime deficit. It was the Chargers' 11th win in their last 12 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Mark Wilkinson scored 35 points for Foothill (8-5).

MILLIKAN EDGES WESTERN TO WIN TITLE

<P>
For three quarters of the Katella High School basketball tournament 
championship game Friday night, Western held a slight edge over Long Beach 
Millikan, not just in points but in intensity and smarts. 
</P>
<P>
But with the fourth quarter, Western's fizz faded while Millikan, the 
tournament's defending champion, took over for a 67-66 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Not that it wasn't hard-fought. 
</P>
<P>
Millikan entered the fourth quarter trailing, 49-47, but after tying the game 
at 60 and then going on a 7-0 run with just over a minute remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Western threatened again, though. Robbie Shelton scored on a baseline drive, 
Cory Manliguis scored off a steal by Thomas Barraza and Sam Sabbara sank both 
ends of a one-and-one to cut Western's deficit to 67-66 with 21 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Western had one last chance when Millikan's Dario Del Cid missed a free throw 
with 10 seconds left. Shelton grabbed the rebound and drove the length of the 
court, but his layup was smothered by Millikan. 
</P>
<P>
"We played just a little bit harder, I think," Millikan Coach Bill Odell said. 
"We went to small (players) in the fourth quarter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the quickness is what made a difference. But the kids just kept 
coming at them." 
</P>
<P>
Although Western outscored Millikan, 15-11, in the first quarter, Millikan 
chipped at Western's lead gradually, and trailed, 36-33, at the half. 
</P>
<P>
Sabbara, who missed his first four shots in the game, scored 24 points -- 
including four three-pointers -- to lead Western (8-3). 
</P>
<P>
Shelton scored 16 and Barraza had 15 for Western. 
</P>
<P>
Millikan (12-3) was led by Ibn Suburi Maddred with 18 points. Pat Thacker added 
14 and Dante Powell had 11 to help the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
Bell 35, Servite 34 -- Servite trailed, 34-26, going into the fourth quarter, 
but fell just short of the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Bell took a 15-8 lead after the first quarter, and Servite cut its deficit to 
25-18 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Marusich, a 6-foot-7 senior, led Servite with 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
Sal Serrano and Alex Del Hierro each scored 10 points for Bell. 
</P>
<P>
In the consolation championship: 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos 66, Katella 49 -- Paul Preuss scored a game-high 20 points to 
lead Rancho Alamitos and Richard Pearce added 12 for the Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Franklin led Katella with 14 points, Paul Schroeder had 11 and Lee Baca 
had 10.

Mission Viejo High School, making its fifth consecutive appearance in the Ocean 
View girls' soccer tournament final, lost to Simi Valley, 4-3, in an overtime 
shootout Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Diablos, who had won the tournament title the past four years, showed the 
strain of playing five games in three days, allowing Simi Valley a goal in the 
first half on a defensive error. 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Jennifer Ward, swamped by Simi Valley players, passed back to goalie 
Tamar de Fries, but Simi Valley forward Korina Kozub overtook them both and 
deftly tapped the ball into the left corner of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Diablo left wing Nikki Charette took the ball, crossed to 
the left of the goal and went out of bounds but was pushed by Simi Valley's 
Tammy Coffman, which gave Charette a penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
Charette booted it into the right corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied at the end of regulation, 1-1, and neither team scored in 
the two five-minute periods. 
</P>
<P>
In the shootout, Charette, Kelly Hampton and Maggie Doherty made their penalty 
kicks, but Simi Valley goalie Jennifer Hollman lunged and deflected Dori Lee's 
kick. The victory was clinched when Mission Viejo's Jenny Delp's kick missed 
the goal entirely. "When we needed to, we just didn't finish," Mission Viejo 
Coach Jim Dutton said. "We just stood there and let the ball roll by. 
</P>
<P>
"They were coming real hard," he said of Simi Valley. "But it's not like we've 
never seen it before; we've seen it 100 times. You have to get into the flow of 
the game. If it's physical, you have to play physical, or you're going to get 
your ears bent back."

BIG DISNEYLAND PARTY MAY LURE MORE TOURISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's Disneyland's 35th birthday in 1990 and, if past years are any indication, 
Orange County's entire tourism industry will be celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the Anaheim theme park is planning a yearlong birthday bash with 
millions of dollars in giveaways. And the last two times Disneyland has partied 
in a big way -- for its 25th and 30th birthdays -- some of the park's magic 
rubbed off on virtually all of Orange County's tourist spots. 
</P>
<P>
"It definitely will help the whole community," said Craig Jacobs, sales 
director of the Hyatt Regency Alicante in Garden Grove. "Whenever Disney has a 
new major attraction or promotion, it impacts the whole (area). There's just an 
influx of people." 
</P>
<P>
"Visitors coming to Disneyland spend a week and not just a day," agreed Cheryl 
Ryan, managing director of the Laguna Beach Chamber of Commerce. "And they 
definitely expand into other areas of the county." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, as Disneyland goes, so goes the rest of Orange County's tourism 
industry -- hotels, motels, restaurants, transportation firms and entertainment 
spots. 
</P>
<P>
That, in fact, was one reason why 1989 generally was viewed as a so-so year for 
the tourism business, with only slight gains, say those in the industry. By 
delaying the opening of its much-heralded Splash Mountain at least six months 
until mid-July, Disneyland put a damper on local tourism. (Disneyland postponed 
opening the ride while technical glitches and design flaws were corrected.) 
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty over the economy had an impact, as well, causing some people to be 
more hesitant about making long-range plans and keeping others from spending as 
much as they might have otherwise. Whirl-a-Round Tours in Newport Beach, for 
example, found that corporate clients who had spent freely in the past on 
special events "cut down considerably on the budget they were willing to spend 
-- or canceled entirely," said Barbara Sloate, the firm's president. 
</P>
<P>
Also, cool, overcast weather along the coastline this year discouraged tourists 
from flocking to the beaches early in the summer. By year's end, Newport Beach 
-- one of the county's most popular seaside leisure spots -- expects to have 
seen about 10 million sunbathers -- or roughly the same number as last year, 
according to the city. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there were those who reported impressive tourism increases this 
year. For many of them, the numbers were the result of a bigger interest in 
Orange County from foreign tourists -- notably travelers from Japan, Australia, 
Korea, western Canada and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point, for example, had record revenue of $50 million 
in 1989 -- a year when foreign travelers, especially from the Pacific Rim, 
increased by at least 20%, said Henry E. Schielein, vice president and general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Plaza saw "heavy increases" in international shoppers this year, 
said mall spokesman Werner Escher. Of the 18 million shoppers who patronized 
the Costa Mesa shopping center this year, the percentage of customers who 
traveled from outside Southern California climbed to more than 20% from the 
15.1% recorded in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana-based Roberts Holiday Lines saw a 20% increase in the number of 
people who booked its charter buses this year, said Dennis Ardecki, sales 
manager. While Ardecki said that international tourism in general seemed to be 
down, "we did some Korean business we hadn't done before. That helped." 
</P>
<P>
So what's the net result? 
</P>
<P>
By year's end, an estimated 35 million people will have visited Orange County 
this year -- up only slightly from the 34.62 million who came here last year, 
according to the Anaheim Visitor &amp; Convention Bureau. Convention attendance 
also increased a bit -- 1,062,347 conventioneers visited the county in 1989, up 
from 1,026,728 in the prior year, bureau officials said. 
</P>
<P>
With the unimpressive results in 1989, tourism industry experts can't help but 
look forward to next year with optimism. 
</P>
<P>
There should be, after all, a new passenger terminal at John Wayne Airport in 
September -- all the better to lure more travelers. The Anaheim Convention 
Center will be modernizing as well as undergoing a $30-million expansion to add 
300,000 square feet of exhibit space and a parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, there's Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
For the park itself -- which saw basically flat attendance of about 13 million 
this year -- the hoopla of the "35 Years of Magic" birthday celebration is 
expected to make more than a mere dent. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope it will be a record year," said Jack Lindquist, executive vice 
president for the park, who believes a weak dollar overseas can only help add 
to the influx of international travelers. 
</P>
<P>
The park's 30th and 25th birthday celebrations translated into several 
additional percentage points in turnstile tallies, said Bob Roth, park 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Knott's Berry Farm, the Buena Park amusement park, expects to benefit from 
Disneyland's bash -- and also will add a $5-million roller coaster called the 
Boomerang by next summer. "We welcome whatever Disneyland does to bring 
tourists to Southern California," said Knott's spokesman Stuart Zanville.

All Together Now: 
</P>
<P>
Say goodby to the '80s. They're outta here! Sayonara. Farewell. Auf wiedersehn. 
Later. 
</P>
<P>
It was a decade that brought a few good things. For instance . . . Well, there 
was . . . Umm . . . Hmmm, give us 10 years and maybe we'll come up with 
something. 
</P>
<P>
Given the weather, the ocean, the generous number of plastic surgeons, 
psychics, psychologists and assorted others who can help you feel good and look 
wonderful, Orange County has carved its own little niche as incubator or 
booster of fads, trends, happenings and blots on humanity. 
</P>
<P>
It may not have started here, but we probably "elevated it to a new level," as 
they say in television sports. Or at least we embraced it. Maybe we even helped 
kill it. 
</P>
<P>
You may have your own pet peeves. These are ours, culled from The Times Orange 
County staff, written and compiled by staff writers John Needham and Nancy 
Wride. If you disagree, drop us a line. But for now, here are the fads we loved 
to hate. 
</P>
<P>
Do you have that silk Giorgio Armani jacket in a 52 short? 
</P>
<P>
Remember Crockett and Tubbs of "Miami Vice"? Oh sure, they looked fine for a 
while. All those nice pastels blended so nicely with the palm trees, sort of 
like Corona del Mar with an MTV soundtrack. Ferraris breaking the sound 
barrier, sort of like Coast Highway in Newport Beach. Huge amounts of drugs 
seized in police raids, sort of like a lot of places in Orange County. But be 
serious now; do you really miss the local version: 50-year-old men with 50-inch 
waists wearing Easter-egg-colored, unlined linen jackets, sleeves rolled up to 
the elbow, a sky blue T-shirt, loafers without socks, French-cut underwear, 
moussed hair (or what's left of it), squeezing behind the wheel of their 
Testerossas? Wearing their Ray-Bans inside a seaside bar where they wrapped 
their lips around a bottle of Corona? And for heaven's sakes, don't forget the 
lime wedge. 
</P>
<P>
And after all that, they still prefer Quarter-Pounders. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's branched out from hamburgers (over 30 zillion served) to chicken, 
ribs, eggs, muffins, and order-takers whose silly grins came straight from 
those insipid smiley-face buttons (see Fads of the '70s We Loved to Hate). 
Elsewhere, the foodies were consuming blue corn tortillas. True. Blue. The 
color of sky, mouthwash and frostbite. The salad wars featured radicchio 
battling arugula for the "must" ingredient of the decade. Spaghetti became 
pasta and immediately went up $5 a plate. Nouvelle cuisine threatened to make 
anorexia commonplace. Silver lining: You could burn the steak or fish beyond 
recognition over the back-yard barbie (using mesquite coals, of course) but 
rescue it by slathering on large amounts of hot sauce and spices and passing it 
off as "Cajun." 
</P>
<P>
Does anyone really care who's in the trunk? 
</P>
<P>
The original rationale of "Baby on Board" signs was that when the paramedics 
arrived at the crash scene with jaws of life at the ready and draped the sheet 
over your body, they wouldn't say, "Hey, what a night. Let's head for 
Winchell's." No, the sign would spur them to look through the iron-and-steel 
pancake for the infant needing help. This assumed that the sign, unlike you, 
survived the crash. And was somewhere where it could be read. And was removed 
from the car each and every time a baby was not on board. The one silver lining 
of the signs was an offshoot it spawned: "Mother-in-law in trunk." That one was 
funny -- the first time you saw it.

In the old days there were gyms. They were smelly and so were the people who 
used them. You wore a leotard only if you knew a plie from a jete. If you rode 
a bike, it meant you couldn't afford a car. Or you had picked up one too many 
DUIs. Now the gym is a health club. The leotards make fashion statements and 
you wear them to the supermarket. The bike costs $2,000 -- and get this, it 
doesn't go anywhere. It's an exercise bike. You get on it and pedal your little 
heart out. You're exhausted. You push the button and the bike's built-in 
computer, the reason it costs $2,000, flashes the message, "You're exhausted." 
And all this has spawned exercise accessories like ankle warmers, wristlets and 
coordinated headbands. The men are wearing Spandex bicycle shorts. They 
shouldn't. After paying hundreds of dollars to join a club and $50 or more a 
month to stay a member, you can develop more than your muscles. You can develop 
a "relationship." Two hard bodies meeting in the Stairmaster line. A fitting 
successor to discos. 
</P>
<P>
Because I'm counting on you to finance my retirement at age 50, that's why. 
</P>
<P>
If you're just looking for a glorified baby sitter, try day care. But as more 
parents started pushing for their kids to actually learn something in the 
process, they picked nursery schools. The result: nursery schools with waiting 
lists. Proving you can't start learning adult behavior too early. Tots' togs 
bore designer labels. The simplest gifts for teens carried price tags of $100 
and up. Even sneakers. By the time their bones creaked and their hands shook 
and they were all of 17, it was time to order up that gleaming, long, white, 
stretch limo to go to the prom in style. Not to worry about higher education, 
though: Saturday study classes became popular (with parents, anyway). And were 
accompanied by consultants on how to get to college. "Study, study, study." 
</P>
<P>
Reach out and crush someone. 
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest corporation in America. Its stock was a widow's delight, 
conservative, good on dividends, no worries. Just say AT&amp;T. Above all, the 
company worked. It actually worked. They broke it up. Of course. Now you buy 
your own phone, plug it into the phone jack and pray nothing goes wrong. Need 
the jack repaired? Good, show us your $100 bill. Get a wrong number? Tough. 
Then there were the offshoots: car phones, portable phones, phones that would 
redial the last number you had dialed, that would forward your calls to another 
phone, that would let you put someone on hold and take a new call coming in to 
see if the second call was from someone more important. That was fun. Until it 
happened to you. "Gotta' run now, this call is important." 
</P>
<P>
If the '60s are over, why do you still have the munchies?

Overnight, grocery stores began staying open all night. True, only one 
check-out line was open. True, it wasn't pillars of the community who were 
shopping at 3 a.m. True, it was hard to navigate up and down aisles overflowing 
with cat food cans waiting to be restocked on the shelves. Still, if you 
suddenly found yourself out of brie, help was at hand. If you absolutely 
couldn't last another moment without a taste of caviar, you had somewhere to 
go. If, heaven forbid, you had only red wine in the house and had decided on a 
4 a.m. fish fry, you knew what you could do. Silver lining: You could always 
get a shopping cart. Gold lining: You could always get a parking space. 
Platinum lining: They'd take just about any coupon you gave them.

I'll take 'Homicide-Inducing Games' for 10, Art. 
</P>
<P>
Leave it to a guy named Erno to think up a game like Rubik's Cube. See, this 
Hungarian architecture professor creates this block of colored boxes, and you 
twist it all around for a couple of bloody days trying to get each of the, er, 
let's see, six sides, one solid color. Yeah, man. This is kind of interesting. 
Ha! While the rest of your friends are breaking open the wine at dinner, you're 
still going to town on this 
</P>
<P>
X!! square of plastic. The decaf cappuccinos are brewing and you've got your 
feet involved in this battle now. Some pretty good times here, huh? A game that 
makes you feel . . . dumber than a rock (no offense to rocks). Of course, good 
ole Erno Rubik made a fortune off this thing before we got the Socially Correct 
Party Game. That's right, Trivial Pursuit, perfect for the '80s, when we hated 
to fritter away time that we could be better off spending acquiring knowledge, 
money, power or all of the above. And Trivial Pursuit shared something in 
common with "Rocky": It developed sequels. 
</P>

The next sound you hear will be your arteries clanging shut.

All of a sudden everyone knew his cholesterol count: 150 (vegetarian); 200 
(lookin' mighty fine, guy); 250 (your wife looks good in black anyway). Then 
came a book saying, "Wait a minute, maybe we've got it wrong. Maybe it's low 
cholesterol that hurts." They're not the only ones who have changed. Plastic 
surgeons made faces tight, breasts large, stomachs flat. Dentists, needing to 
come up with college tuition for their kids, invented new ways to separate 
people from their money too. Tooth bonding. Porcelain veneering. Plastic, 
nearly invisible braces. They discovered gum problems in middle-age men who 
were trying to get their own kids through college. The lawyers paid off the 
dentists by billing us $450 an hour. We told the kids to win scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Cross-dressing ex-cons and the biker gang members who love them. Or vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
He opened a safe. It was empty. He stuck his nose in other people's business. 
It got broken. But did he take the hint? Did he leave? Uh-uh. Oh, Geraldo. He 
had company. Oprah lost weight. Phil grew a beard. Sally had three names. 
Whatever. The forces of daytime TV talk shows turned over rocks in every burg 
in America, looking for people who hated their friends, loved their enemies and 
took their clothes off when they shudn't oughta' done that. For those wanting 
more in-depth reportage, though, there were People and Us magazines. Not to be 
confused with Interview and Vanity Fair. The decade of gossip even had a theme 
song: "Dirty Laundry." 
</P>
<P>
How do you tell a drunken sailor? 
</P>
<P>
It used to be seamen on shore leave who got tattoos. Every once in a while 
there'd be a mass murderer with Mom or Love burned onto his biceps in indelible 
ink. But then came the disclosure that Secretary of State George Shultz has a 
Princeton tiger tattooed on a part of his body seen only by his wife and the 
guys in the locker room. Mark Gastineau and Brigitte Nielsen got tattooed for 
each other. We didn't see theirs, either. And finally Cher turned her back on 
us, wore an incredible outfit -- even by her standards -- and showed us her 
tattoo. On anyone else, we wouldn't have seen it, but you know that Cher. 
</P>
<P>
He's tanned. He's rested. He's ready. 
</P>
<P>
Yorba Linda, birthplace of Richard M. Nixon, won the battle to be the site of 
the Nixon library. Fittingly in a land where "surf's up" outweighs "back to 
school" as a battle cry, it will be a library without books. Well, at least not 
the sort of books you're used to seeing in a presidential library. Documents 
and tapes from the Nixon presidency, normally de rigeur for this sort of 
archive, have been confiscated by the federal government, thanks to Watergate 
(see "Fads of the '70s We Loved to Hate"). Other materials from the days before 
he became president were turned over to the government in 1968 to get a tax 
break (see "Fads of the '60s We Loved to Hate"). Still more historical 
artifacts are part of the Cal State Fullerton Oral History Program. Yorba Linda 
doesn't mind, though. After all, the house where Nixon was born is featured on 
the city seal. 
</P>
<P>
Baby, you can drive my car. 
</P>
<P>
Used to be you got your car valet-parked when you were going someplace really 
special -- like the Academy Awards or at least a ritzy restaurant that was 
probably French. That was OK because, hey, the place was French and the dinner 
was costing you so much you didn't care about a measly buck for the valet tip. 
Now it seems that people park your car everywhere, and it's not a gratuity but 
a service charge. At some joints, they force you to let them park it -- for a 
$2 fee. Almost makes you feel held up before dinner, doesn't it? The fact that 
the radio station is always on some other channel than yours nags at you, 
leading to suspicions that your car went drag-racing without you. 
</P>
<P>
It still beats platform shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Women started the decade looking like women. They ended it looking like 
football linebackers. "Dress for Success" meant blue suits, standard-issue 
white blouses and big, loud paisley "power" bows. Then came shoulder pads, 
creating a profile only a football coach could appreciate. Top it all off with 
a pair of Reeboks. Scout South Coast Plaza at noon or 6 p.m. someday to see the 
total effect. "She's really strong through the shoulders, Brent, and she's got 
her game face on." 
</P>
<P>
Muffy meets Lands' End. 
</P>
<P>
Holy Moley, was this the decade of the duck. Those little quackers stepped out 
of your kid's nursery and onto your tie. Maybe yuppies really are just preppies 
with better clothes. Starting with the Reagan White House and finishing with 
the Bush administration, we returned to tradition. Nancy introduced us to the 
Chanel look, Barbara brought us pearls. And designers such as Ralph Lauren have 
made stuff fashionable that you would have refused to wear in high school. We 
are talking about the golfer thing. Plaid pants, corduroy blazers, shoes with 
tassels, for Pete's sake! And suddenly you found yourself succumbing, even as 
you panicked that you were becoming your father. Your coffee table just 
wouldn't do without a catalogue from Lands' End, L.L. Beene or Eddie Bauer. 
Jumpers became acceptable for women over age 12. Sales of penny loafers soared. 
Khaki pants, Topsiders, polo shirts -- collars up, of course -- became the 
rage. Silver lining: You could get away with sensible shoes at a party. 
</P>
<P>
Eau de Rich and Famous. 
</P>
<P>
Okay, so you can't look like your favorite celebrity. You can still smell like 
them! We've seen some big personalities get behind their favorite toilette 
water these past 10 years, the latest of which is trumpeter Herb Alpert. (Can 
anybody even remember the name of his last album?) Making Alpert's perfume, 
called Listen, taught him a lot: "When I started dealing with the perfumers, 
they talked my language: high end, low end, top note, opening note, mid-range, 
bass and treble." Oh puh-lease! The debut of Sophia Loren's perfume in 1980 
launched the celebrity fragrance derby. Then came "Forever Krystle," named 
after Linda Evans' character in the TV series, "Dynasty," followed by 
Carrington, good ole Blake's gift to his wife. Julio ("Of All the Girls I've 
Loved Before") Iglesias has his own perfume now (he evidently did lots of field 
work to hit the right brew). Smokey Robinson allegedly is working on a 
fragrance, as are Joan Collins, Priscilla Presley and Mikhail Baryshnikov. 
Jaclyn Smith introduced California, Catherine Deneuve had a self-named 
fragrance and Cher made a splash last year with Uninhibited. But the 
blockbuster celebrity perfume continues to be Elizabeth Taylor's Passion, which 
customers like because they view the violet-eyed actress as a survivor. The 
fragrance industry spends a fortune exploring how the brain responds to smell, 
but no magic answer has been found. Which probably explains why the World 
Wrestling Federation is developing a fragrance for its fans that has been 
dubbed, Eau de Sweat. 
</P>
<P>
This looks like Grandma's house. 
</P>
<P>
No rock garden here, but almost. Flamingos on the lawn, meat loaf in the oven. 
Lava lamps in the living room. Retro -- that return to the 1950s -- cheapened 
houses at the same time that their value skyrocketed. Now it was possible to 
live in a $400,000 home that looked like a trailer. You could go out to eat at 
diners with black-and-white check floors and Dean Martin crooning on the 
jukebox. Silver lining: Detroit brought back convertibles, so you could drive 
to the diner in style. 
</P>
<P>
Read our lips: Money talks, everyone else walks. 
</P>
<P>
They call it life in the fast lane. Twice in the decade, the leaders of Orange 
County asked voters to approve a sales-tax increase to pay for better roads, or 
new roads, or space shuttles, or UFOs, or something to do with transportation. 
Twice the idea lost. Now the plan is for toll roads. It's a concept borrowed 
from New York -- home of Leona Helmsley, Donald Trump and George Steinbrenner. 
Although you thought your taxes went to build and repair roads, if you want to 
go faster than 5 m.p.h., you have to pay again, shelling out a toll for a 
highway with less traffic. It's a perfect Orange County concept: The rich go 
faster.

BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS: 'EVA'S WAR' IS FIRST-PERSON ACCOUNT OF SURVIVING HORRORS

"What should I do?" 
</P>
<P>
That's the question a worried Eva Krutein asked herself in January, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Danzig, the former "free city" seized by Germany when Hitler 
invaded neighboring Poland in 1939, Krutein, then 20, anxiously paced her 
living room: Should she remain in Danzig and "face the Russian hordes" or flee 
and "go into the unknown" with her 14-month-old daughter, Lili? 
</P>
<P>
Danzig, a historic port city on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea, marked by 
medieval towers and cathedrals, had so far escaped the bombing that had 
destroyed Dresden, Cologne and Berlin. But the battered German army was fleeing 
as the Russian army was advanced in the east. 
</P>
<P>
It would only be a matter of time until the Russians reached Danzig, and 
Krutein had heard what had happened in the village of Nemmersdorf: Russian 
soldiers had raped every woman and girl, then murdered all 74 inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
Krutein's husband, Manfred, could not help her. He was a lieutenant in the 
German navy and was directing submarine repairs in St. Nazaire on the French 
Atlantic coast. The German submarine pens were surrounded by the Americans, and 
she hadn't received a letter from Manfred in six months. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of refugees, fearful of falling into Russian hands, were streaming 
into Danzig every day. 
</P>
<P>
"What should I do?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer is chronicled in "Eva's War: A True Story of Survival" (Amador 
Publishers; $17 hardback, $9 paperback), and it is a compelling account of the 
hardships and horrors of war as seen through the youthful eyes of Krutein, now 
68 and a retired music teacher who lives in Irvine with Manfred. 
</P>
<P>
With the roads blocked and the trains at a standstill, Krutein decided to flee 
Danzig by the only available means. She boarded a ship bound for the west, 
reasoning that at least the British and Americans "aren't beasts like the 
Russians." 
</P>
<P>
Carrying a coveted boarding permit that her parents' housekeeper, a member of 
the underground, had given her, Krutein with her daughter was able to board a 
small freighter in the harbor. But after two days, it appeared that the 
refugee-packed ship would never pull anchor, so she and her daughter got off. 
With an extraordinary pluck born of fear, Krutein managed to get herself and 
Lili aboard another vessel -- a 1,600-passenger ocean liner packed with 10,000 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
After landing in Kiel in northwest Germany she learned that the freighter had 
been torpedoed at sea and sunk. Everyone aboard had perished. 
</P>
<P>
With a novelist's attention to detail, Krutein provides a moving account of the 
next 12 months -- the times she and Lili would huddle with hundreds of 
strangers in shelters during bombings, fleeing to the relative safety of the 
countryside when women and children were ordered out of Kiel, an interrogation 
by the Gestapo after referring to a German officer as a "shark" in a letter to 
her father, the shortage of food, her reunion with Manfred, the new life she 
started at the end of the war. 
</P>
<P>
In chronicling the story, Krutein serves up a litany of the horrors of war: 
</P>
<P>
* The female friend who was raped 30 times by Russian soldiers. How, after a 
Russian soldier shot the woman's infant daughter in the face, she strangled the 
baby to cut short its suffering. 
</P>
<P>
* The civilians who, after the fall of Danzig, had to beg and rummage for food 
in garbage cans. How residents were forbidden to bury the bodies on the streets 
and how, after the stench became unbearable, the Russians poured vodka on the 
bodies and set them afire. 
</P>
<P>
* The sight of buildings that had been bombed and burned out, the families 
"living like rats in holes" beneath the rubble of their former homes. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, "Eva's War" remains an uplifting family odyssey, one leavened 
by Krutein's humanity and her love of music, which provided a welcome 
counterpoint to the atrocities all around her. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred-Maurice de Zayas, senior legal officer with the United Nations in 
Geneva, Switzerland, and a historian of Germany's expulsion from the lost 
territories in the east, says in his foreword: "Sad revelations, painful 
memories, excruciating experiences are tempered by compassion, love and a 
powerful, contagious optimism. . . . An indomitable love of life and of her 
family makes her prevail." 
</P>
<P>
Krutein said she wrote the book "to let Americans know what happened" to the 14 
million Germans who fled or were expelled from their homeland. More than 2 
million Germans, according to historians, did not survive the experience. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Krutein said, "all the news about Germany was repressed here, so 
nobody knew or believed (what had happened). But when the information came out 
and the (history) books were even in the libraries in the university, nobody 
checked them out." 
</P>
<P>
With the crumbling of the Berlin Wall and the reforms sweeping through Eastern 
Europe, the publication of "Eva's War" could not be more timely. A powerful 
anti-war statement, the book is, as Krutein says in the publisher's preface, "a 
war cry against the glorification of war." 
</P>
<P>
After the war, Eva and her daughter reunited with Manfred in Germany in a town 
called Wilhelmshaven, where Manfred built a shipyard. But fearful of another 
war with the Soviet Union, the Kruteins immigrated to Santiago, Chile, in 1951. 
There, Manfred worked as a mining engineer and Eva as an opera coach and 
pianist, and newspaper reviewer of concerts and books. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of Germans there after the war -- even before the war. Many 
Chileans were married to Germans," she said. "That's one of the reasons we went 
down there. We didn't know a single soul here, and without sponsors we couldn't 
come." 
</P>
<P>
In 1960, however, the Kruteins, who by then had five children, were able to 
come to the United States. Manfred, now a retired ocean-mining engineer, is 
writing a novel about the war. Eva retired as a music teacher three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Although Krutein said she wrote her first story when she was 8 and had always 
dreamed of writing a novel, "music was the greater calling, so I concentrated 
on music all the time." 
</P>
<P>
That changed in 1981, when she decided to take a grammar class to improve her 
English. But the "grammar class" she showed up for turned out to be an advanced 
course in novel writing. Finding it "fascinating," she decided to stay in it. 
</P>
<P>
Krutein said she spent four years on her 253-page book, originally written as a 
fact-based novel rather than a first-person memoir. 
</P>
<P>
Blessed with "an unusual memory," Krutein said she had no trouble remembering 
the events and conversations that occurred during the year chronicled in her 
book. Besides, she said, "traumatic experiences are something you don't easily 
forget." 
</P>
<P>
For many years, Krutein said, she had repressed a lot of what had happened to 
her and her family during the war. 
</P>
<P>
"It was because you can't talk to somebody about it," she said. "Nobody 
understands it. In Germany it's different. Everybody has the same story." 
</P>
<P>
Still, writing about the events was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"It was painful, very painful," she said, "That's why I put humor in too -- 
just to lighten it up." 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult part for Krutein was writing about the death of her mother, 
who, she said, was gang-raped by five Russian soldiers. As related to Krutein 
by her parents' former housekeeper after the war, her mother was so consumed 
with shame and guilt that she killed herself with cyanide. 
</P>
<P>
"It was terrible. I cried at first," Krutein said. "I identified with her, and 
it was terrible because it happened not only to her but to millions of women." 
</P>
<P>
Krutein lost her father a few months after the war. He died of typhus. 
</P>
<P>
But, like many who have published memoirs about wrenching experiences, Eva said 
that writing her book was therapeutic. "You write and rewrite and rewrite, and 
finally the whole thing is not that traumatic any more." 
</P>
<P>
When the book was finished, Krutein said, a literary agent tried for a year to 
interest publishers in New York, but they rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
"They said: 'The book is very interesting, but it requires sympathy for 
Germans. At this point, there isn't any,' " Krutein said. Krutein kept her 
manuscript in her garage for the next few years, returning her focus to music 
and serving as a coordinator for SERVAS (from the Esperanto word for service), 
an international organization dedicated to promoting world peace and 
understanding. The organization enables international travelers to be housed in 
private homes, and the Kruteins have opened their home over the years to 
hundreds of travelers from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, their link with SERVAS turned out to be the key to getting "Eva's War" 
published. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, the Kruteins were staying in the Albuquerque, N.M., home of SERVAS 
member Harry Willson of Amador Publishers, a small press that usually publishes 
fiction. 
</P>
<P>
Krutein told Willson about her manuscript, and he asked her to send him a copy. 
</P>
<P>
"He loved it," she said. Willson, however, advised her to change the book from 
a third-person novel to a first-person memoir. "The content is true," she says 
of it in its present form, "but the structure is a novel. It's a hybrid." 
</P>
<P>
Krutein recently did readings from her book to an overflow crowd at 
Upchurch-Brown Booksellers in Laguna Beach, and she has a dozen more readings 
lined up for churches and social clubs over the next few months. ("Eva's War" 
can be bought directly from the publisher: Amador Publishers, P.O. Box 12335, 
Albuquerque, N.M. 87195.) 
</P>
<P>
Her meeting with her publisher was, she concedes with a warm smile, a stroke of 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
"Without luck, you can't do anything," she said. Despite her suffering through 
the horrors of war, she had her share of good fortune during that year. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," she said. "Otherwise, I wouldn't be here."

JOSEPH N. BELL: NEW YEAR'S CALLS FOR A COMPULSORY GOOD TIME, NO MATTER HOW 
TEDIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

One of the conventional absolutes about holidays -- all holidays -- is that 
those celebrating them have to have a good time. It's required. This is 
especially true over the Christmas holidays, and at least 10 times as true when 
it comes to New Year's Eve. Members of the middle class culture in the United 
States of America have been raised inexorably to believe that it is downright 
un-American not to have one hell of a time on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
So we try. Man, do we try. 
</P>
<P>
We give parties or go to parties, and drink too much and stay up too late, and 
spend the next day in a comatose state watching football for 12 hours, until 
the Sugar Bowl fuses into the Rose Bowl and both of them coalesce into the 
Orange Bowl. About all the energy you have left is expended switching channels, 
since bowls overlap outrageously, frequently requiring more vigilance than you 
are prepared to invest. 
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure that New Year's Day would be any different for a football junkie 
after a decent night's sleep, but this year I'm going to find out. My wife and 
I will go out to a modest dinner alone and then probably go home and go to bed. 
We might read for a while. I suspect we'll be asleep at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
I probably won't do this without guilt. In the Midwestern town in which I grew 
up, certain things were programmed into me during young adulthood. Friday and 
Saturday were date nights. If you spent a Saturday night alone, you were a 
social leper of such alarming proportions that you were considered either 
backward, terminally unattractive or eccentric beyond imagination. Formal 
dances took place every Saturday night between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and 
all of this social activity culminated in a New Year's Eve ball. 
</P>
<P>
This continued into college, until World War II interfered. But when my 
generation married and started our own families, the need to be festive on New 
Year's Eve carried over. The best way to solve the problem of what to do on 
this quintessential party evening was to throw one yourself -- and for many 
years we did. It was my shtick to organize the fun and games, and I did it with 
almost missionary zeal. I think most of the people who came enjoyed it, but 
what an enormous investment in energy it required -- both to plan and 
participate in it. And the roots of that energy were planted firmly in youthful 
soil nurtured with a conviction that you had to have fun, fun, fun on New 
Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
I thought about that a lot the other night when we had our first experience 
with participatory theater. Some dear friends celebrating a wedding anniversary 
invited us to join them at a show in Los Angeles called "Tony 'n Tina's 
Wedding." The premise is interesting and provocative. The audience becomes the 
guests at a very funny and flamboyant Italian wedding, complete with Mafia 
types, godfathers, mistresses, a priest who solicits funds for his church 
before he starts the wedding, a nun who leads the guests in singing an awful 
hymn, and various weeping truculent relatives. That part of it worked fine. We 
could sit back and watch and participate if we chose. 
</P>
<P>
But then the show moved indoors to a wedding reception, and the guests were 
drawn into the action more than some of us wanted to be. A rock band played at 
head-shattering noise levels, pausing only during the brief period we ate pasta 
and salad and drank bad champagne. There were bits of business going on between 
the principals in the wedding, but mostly the actors worked the room, sitting 
at the guest tables, cajoling audience members to the dance floor and starting 
conversations in which one wasn't sure whether to deal with them in or out of 
character. 
</P>
<P>
If the piece works, we should deal with them in character, of course, but 
playing this game very long is difficult, especially when you realize that the 
actors have heard your bon mots a few thousand times before. So it finally 
becomes tiring, especially against the backdrop of noise that virtually 
precludes conversation below a shout. And for the last half-hour or so, I had 
the powerful feeling that I really was at the wedding reception of people I 
neither knew nor liked, that the party had turned boringly strident, and that I 
just wanted to go home. I don't think that was the intent of the entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
I was a little disappointed in myself -- especially for stiffing the actress 
playing the mistress when she tried to get me on the dance floor -- and I've 
thought about it a good deal since. I wondered how many of the people who 
played my New Year's Eve games did it by sufferance, feeling much the same way 
I did at Tony's wedding. I realized that most of us are uncomfortable with 
packaged and compulsory fun unless it fulfills a strong need we have at the 
moment. And I also realized that because we are all very different creatures, 
some of us can slip more easily into programmed fun than others. 
</P>
<P>
None of these are very profound thoughts, but they had to work their way up 
through a thick encrustation of compulsive fun on specified occasions. 
Especially New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
So Sunday night, I may watch the new year come in on TV in New York or Chicago, 
but I doubt if I'll make Denver. And in the same spirit of change, I might even 
skip the Hall of Fame Bowl and the Citrus Bowl on New Year's Day so I'll be 
fresh for the Notre Dame-Colorado game. But one thing probably won't change: I 
suspect I'll still be having fun.
